    "since the discovery of magnetic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) in [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(ch@xmath4coo)@xmath5(h@xmath6o)@xmath7@xmath8 2ch@xmath4cooh@xmath9h@xmath6o ( mn@xmath0-ac),@xcite single molecule magnets ( smms ) have become the focus of considerable experimental and theoretical interest due to their novel quantum properties @xcite and possible future use in quantum computational devices.@xcite mn@xmath0-ac remains the most widely studied smm due to its large spin ground state ( @xmath10 , see refs [ ] ) , together with a considerable easy - axis magneto - crystalline anisotropy.@xcite these combined factors result in a sizeable kinetic barrier against spin reversal at the molecular level , leading to slow magnetization relaxation and hysteresis ( bistability ) at low temperatures ( below  @xmath113  k).@xcite when a dc magnetic field is applied parallel to the easy - axis of a single crystal of mn@xmath0-ac , sharp steps are observed in its hysteresis loops at well defined field strengths.@xcite the enhanced magnetization relaxation at these steps is the result of resonant mqt .",
    "while a clearer picture concerning the mechanism of mqt in mn@xmath0-ac is beginning to emerge , @xcite many interesting problems remain .",
    "in particular , current theoretical models assume the presence of quadratic and quartic transverse crystal - field interactions in the spin hamiltonian [ @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the former has been ascribed to solvent disorder.@xcite however , these interactions , which contain only even powers of the raising and lowering operators , _ do not _ provide an explanation for the observation of odd mqt steps in the hysteresis loops , i.e. tunneling via resonances between levels whose spin projections ( @xmath14 ) differ by an odd integer.@xcite it is generally recognized that the underlying mechanism _ must _ involve internal transverse fields,@xcite but their source has yet to be identified .",
    "prokofev and stamp@xcite proposed that hyperfine interactions might provide the answer ; however , the calculated mqt rates were too small .",
    "subsequently , garanin and chudnovsky@xcite suggested that strains or structural defects in the crystal lattice ( dislocations ) could lead to a distribution of tilts of the magnetic easy - axes at the mn@xmath0-ac cluster sites ; upon application of an external magnetic field , such tilts would result in a distribution of transverse fields , even when the field is applied parallel to the global symmetry ( @xmath2- ) axis of the crystal . while this model was in qualitative agreement with the fact that experiments revealed significant distributions in the finite field mqt rates,@xcite the measured distributions were considerably narrower than those predicted by garanin and chudnovsky.@xcite    although some preliminary spectroscopic data have been reported in support of dislocations,@xcite a more plausible model leading to easy - axis - tilting",
    "was recently suggested by cornia et al.@xcite based on a detailed analysis of existing x - ray diffraction data and some approximate electronic structure calculations , they propose that such a local symmetry lowering and easy - axis - tilting can be ascribed to the presence of the two acetic acids of crystallization in the unit cell .",
    "experiments in support of this model were recently published by us,@xcite and by del  barco et al.@xcite however , evidence for the easy - axis - tilting was lacking in these investigations , though we note that tilts have recently been reported for a related mn@xmath0 complex in a separate study by del barco et al.@xcite here we report electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) measurements on precisely ( in - situ ) aligned mn@xmath0-ac single crystals under large applied fields in the transverse direction . at relatively low frequencies ( @xmath15  ghz ) ,",
    "as the field is rotated away from the hard plane , simulations show that the epr intensity should oscillate between two series of resonances excited from  even \" and  odd \" spin states ( labeled @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , see following section ) . the magnetic dipole matrix elements and transition frequencies",
    "associated with these  even \" and  odd \" resonances are extremely sensitive to the field orientation ( providing @xmath18 resolution ) , allowing for a precise appraisal of the cornia model .",
    "indeed , experiments reveal a significant overlap of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 resonances , providing conclusive evidence for the presence of tilts . however , we find that the magnitude of the tilts is a factor of @xmath19 larger than predicted by cornia et al.,@xcite which should be of both theoretical and experimental significance in regards to understanding the spin dynamics of mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "our conclusions also provide an explanation for several previously reported anomalous epr transitions ( labeled @xmath17-resonances ) which can not be explained within the widely accepted giant spin ( @xmath20 ) model described below.@xcite    we emphasize from the outset that our conclusions are based upon the angle - dependent behavior of epr fine structures which have previously been explained@xcite within the context of the cornia solvent - disorder picture,@xcite and have been independently supported by magnetization measurements.@xcite the easy axis tilting is inferred from the persistence of epr peaks for field orientations which are tilted significantly away from the angles where the intensity should have vanished if all molecules were aligned . the discrete nature of the tilting can then be seen from the fact that the different fine structures exhibit distinct angle dependencies .",
    "this behavior is completely reproducible in mn@xmath0-ac samples prepared by different methods and by different groups.@xcite furthermore , our method of analysis is not sensitive to the intricacies associated with lineshape analyses , which could be influenced by complex many - body effects , e.g. magnetic spin - spin interactions.@xcite finally , we note that all of the unusual solvent - induced anomalies reported in this paper for mn@xmath0-ac are absent in the epr spectra for a related high - symmetry ( @xmath21 ) mn@xmath0 complex [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(o@xmath22cch@xmath22br)@xmath5(h@xmath22o)@xmath234ch@xmath6cl@xmath6 ] which possesses a full compliment of four ch@xmath6cl@xmath6 solvent molecules per mn@xmath0.@xcite",
    "the basis of our experiment is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , which shows the spin energy level diagram for mn@xmath0-ac ( fig .",
    "1a ) , based on an exact diagonalization of the standard @xmath3 spin hamiltonian @xcite under a transverse magnetic field @xmath25 , and assuming @xmath21 symmetry :     @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the projection of the spin operator @xmath28 along @xmath2 , and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the uniaxial anisotropy parameter ; the second term is the zeeman interaction ; and the remaining terms represent higher order crystal field interactions ( the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 have their usual meaning).@xcite we have used acceptable parameters for the simulations in fig .  1 : @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath35 = @xmath36 @xmath34 and @xmath37 = @xmath38 @xmath34 .",
    "we note that this parameter set yields the optimum agreement with a large body of single crystal epr data,@xcite including the present study , which additionally considers the effects of _ e_-strain and easy axis tilting . at this stage",
    ", we do not explicitly include lower symmetry interactions in eq .  1 due to disorder , e.g. second - order rhombicity , or easy - axis tilting .",
    "we begin by considering a single molecule and the effect of field - mis - alignment away from the hard plane .",
    "we then compare experimental data with simulations in order to quantify the easy - axis tilting caused by the solvent - disorder in mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "finally , we consider the rhombic anisotropy associated with this disorder .",
    "we note that an account of the influence of the solvent - disorder - induced rhombic anisotropy [ @xmath39 , and its affect on the transverse field epr fine structure , has been presented previously by us.@xcite in the following , we use polar coordinates to parameterize the field orientation : @xmath40 represents the angle between the applied field and the global easy ( @xmath2- ) axis of the single crystal ; @xmath41 represents the azimuthal angle , i.e. the angle between the intrinsic hard four - fold ( @xmath42- ) @xmath43 axis and the projection of the applied field onto the hard plane .    in the high - field limit ( @xmath44*b *  @xmath45 ) , and for the standard epr geometry ( microwave field * h*@xmath46*b * ) , one expects a total of 20 @xmath47 epr transitions between the 21 ( @xmath48 ) spin - states for @xmath3 . for clarity , only a few of the lowest - lying levels are shown in fig .",
    "1a for the case of a magnetic field applied precisely along the medium four - fold axis of a single molecule ( i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) ; these levels are labeled on the right - hand - side of fig .",
    "1a according to an @xmath51 basis , where @xmath52 (=  integer ) is the projection of the total spin along the applied field axis .",
    "the high - field epr spectra are dominated by transitions between adjacent levels , i.e. @xmath53 . if one follows the epr spectra to lower fields , into a region where the zeeman and axial terms in eq .",
    "1 become comparable ( @xmath54*b *  @xmath55 ) , one finds that the transitions may be grouped into two categories : i ) those between levels which evolve from @xmath56 ( @xmath57  integer ) zero - field doublets , which we label @xmath16 ( represented by blue sticks in fig .",
    "1a ) ; and ii ) those between levels which evolve from adjacent zero - field doublets , which we label @xmath17 ( represented by red solid circles in fig .  1a ) .",
    "this distinction between @xmath16 and @xmath17 resonances is based on a zero - field @xmath58 basis , where @xmath59 is the projection of the total spin along the uniaxial direction of the crystal @xmath60 the levels are labeled according to this convention on the left - hand - side of fig .",
    "1a . throughout the remainder of the paper",
    ", we number all transitions according to the absolute value of @xmath52 ( high - field @xmath51 representation ) associated with the level from which the transition was excited , preceded by either @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( low - field @xmath58 representation ) in order to distinguish between the two categories of resonances . therefore , the highest field blue stick in fig .",
    "1a corresponds to @xmath61 , while the highest field red circle corresponds to @xmath62.@xcite    in order to set the scene , we first review the status of earlier single - crystal epr studies .",
    "the observation most pertinent to the present work is seen in fig .",
    "1b , which compares various calculations of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 transition frequencies with actual 8  k epr peak positions.@xcite for these earlier experiments , data were obtained with the field applied parallel to the hard plane of a single - crystal sample to within an accuracy of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) . within the hard plane",
    ", a crude attempt was made to align the magnetic field along the medium four - fold axis .",
    "based on our more recent angle dependent studies on accurately aligned single crystals ( section  iii and ref .",
    "[ ] ) , we estimate that such an alignment was achieved to within an accuracy of approximately @xmath65 ( i.e. @xmath66 ) . for the purposes of the following discussion ,",
    "any mis - alignment within the hard plane is not important . in the absence of tilting",
    ", the calculated @xmath16 transition frequencies decrease smoothly to zero ( thick blue curves in fig .",
    "1b ) , whereas the @xmath17 transition frequencies ( thick red curves in fig .",
    "1b ) go through minima which are on the order of 90  ghz for the three highest field branches .",
    "the actual @xmath17-transition data , on the other hand , deviate significantly from these predictions , i.e. they do not exhibit a minimum frequency , but instead follow monotonic curves to the lowest frequencies investigated .",
    "the same trend has been noted for field alignment along different directions within the hard plane.@xcite for comparison , fig .",
    "2 displays representative experimental epr spectra obtained with the field approximately along the hard four - fold axis ( @xmath67 ) , also within @xmath68 of the hard / medium plane ( @xmath69);@xcite note that the @xmath17-resonances are again seen to the lowest frequencies studied ( 44  ghz ) .",
    "following our more recent angle - dependent studies that provided clear indications for a breakdown of the four - fold symmetry of mn@xmath0-ac,@xcite and in light of the cornia model,@xcite we conjecture that the anomalous behavior of the @xmath17 transitions might be explained in terms of tilts of the easy - axes of magnetization at a local scale .",
    "to better illustrate this idea , we have included tilted field calculations in fig .",
    "1b ( thin curves : blue@xmath70 , red@xmath71 ) for a few of the highest field transitions .",
    "each tilted field curve belongs to a family of curves which deviate successively ( in @xmath72 increments ) from one of the zero - tilt curves ( @xmath49 , thick lines ) ; the tilted field curves have been truncated at low fields in order to simplify the figure .",
    "tilting the field away from the hard plane results in a field component parallel to the easy axis .",
    "this  longitudinal \" field ( @xmath73 ) has the effect of lifting the degeneracy of the of the @xmath56 zero - field doublets in zeroth order.@xcite consequently , instead of tending to zero - frequency , the @xmath16 resonance frequencies tend to successively larger offsets as the field is tilted away from the hard plane , as seen by the thin blue curves and indicated by the blue arrow ( for @xmath61 ) in fig .",
    "the opposite is true for the @xmath17 transitions .",
    "since the longitudinal field splits the low - field @xmath56 doublets , this results in a reduction in the closest approach of levels in adjacent doublets @xmath60 hence , to a reduction in the minimum frequency of the @xmath17 transitions ; again , this behavior is born out by the thin red curves and indicated by the red arrow ( for @xmath62 ) in fig .",
    "thus , tilting could explain the continuation of the @xmath17 resonance data to frequencies well below the theoretical minima given by the thick red curves ( @xmath49 , or @xmath74 ) in fig .",
    "however , the observed trend can not be ascribed to a simple mis - alignment of the sample , because the @xmath61 ( highest field blue squares ) and @xmath62 ( highest field red circles ) resonances are both seen to frequencies below 50  ghz ( see also fig .  2 ) .",
    "the observation of @xmath62 at 45  ghz would imply a sample mis - alignment of @xmath75 , which is completely incompatible with the observed behavior of the @xmath61 data which tracks the thick blue curve ( @xmath49 , or @xmath74 ) in fig .",
    "1b ; note that each successive thin curve corresponds to an additional @xmath72 of tilt away from the hard plane .",
    "thus , it would appear that the data in figs .  1 and 2 reflect several molecular orientations .",
    "a rigorous comparison between experiment and eq .  1 , in this frequency / field range where the zeeman and axial terms are comparable , requires calculation of magnetic dipole matrix elements , i.e. a full simulation of the epr spectra .",
    "3 and  4 show 15  k epr simulations , as a function of the polar angle @xmath40 between the applied field and the easy axis of a single molecule , and for two of the lowest frequencies used in our experiments ( 44  ghz and 62  ghz ) ; the simulations are limited to the @xmath76 to @xmath77 range in @xmath78 increments . in figs  3a and  4a",
    ", the vertical scale represents microwave absorption while , in figs  3b and  4b , absorption is indicated by the darker shaded regions .",
    "the simulations were generated using the software package sim;@xcite no rhombic ( @xmath79 ) term was included at this stage , and the simulations assume perfect alignment of all molecules in the sample , i.e. no orientational averaging was employed . as expected , the simulations confirm that only the @xmath16 peaks are observed for fields parallel to the hard plane ( @xmath80 ) , for @xmath81  ghz .",
    "however , tilting the field away from the hard plane leads to a very abrupt suppression of the magnetic dipole matrix elements ( epr selection rules ) for the @xmath16 transitions @xmath60 this behavior was not obvious from fig .  1 .",
    "in just @xmath82 of rotation , @xmath61 vanishes completely at 44  ghz ( @xmath63 for 62  ghz ) .",
    "this is then followed by a range of almost @xmath83 where neither @xmath61 nor @xmath62 are observed at the lowest frequency of 44  ghz , i.e. @xmath62 does not appear until the field is tilted about @xmath84 away from the hard plane .",
    "similar trends are seen at both frequencies for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , etc .. , albeit over differing angle ranges .",
    "remarkably , the simulations are suggestive of a symmetry effect in the transverse - field ( @xmath87 ) epr spectra , as a function of the longitudinal field component ( @xmath88 ) . the dashed curves on the contour plots in figs .",
    "3b and  4b indicate lines of constant @xmath73 , demonstrating that all of the @xmath16 resonances disappear ( and all of the @xmath17 resonances appear ) at roughly the same longitudinal field strengths .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath17 resonances disappear and the @xmath89 resonances re - appear .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the tunnel - splittings seen in the fe@xmath90 smm as a function of transverse field , for different static longitudinal fields.@xcite indeed , closer inspection of fig .",
    "1b reveals that the @xmath17 transition frequencies tend to zero at certain values of @xmath73 , while the simulations in figs .",
    "3 and 4 suggest that the @xmath17 transitions matrix elements tend to zero as well at these same angles .",
    "thus , the analogy with the quenching of the ground - state tunnel splittings in fe@xmath90 is significant , albeit the degeneracies involve excited levels evolving from different zero - field doublets in the present case .",
    "we shall not pursue this analogy further here .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath17 series of resonances is exactly what one would expect from a spin @xmath91 system in a perpendicular field with the same hamiltonian parameters as the parent @xmath20 system;@xcite meanwhile @xmath92 corresponds to the first expected peak in a series belonging to a spin @xmath93 system , and so on . furthermore , all resonances except for @xmath61 occur from excited levels .",
    "thus , the tilted field data have the appearance of spectra from excited multiplets having successively lower total spin , as was originally proposed by us as an explanation for the anomalous @xmath17 resonances.@xcite    an intensity analysis of the measured low - frequency ( @xmath15  ghz ) @xmath62 peaks in fig .  2 yields an ( approximate ) activation energy consistent with an excitation from the @xmath94 state within the @xmath20 manifold .",
    "we should point out that , in order to precisely fit the @xmath95 intensity , one must first fully comprehend its origin ( we save such an analysis until the end of this article ) . the clearest indication that @xmath62 likely occurs within the @xmath20 manifold",
    "can be seen by noting that the temperature dependencies of the @xmath95 and @xmath96 transitions in fig .",
    "2 are very similar , suggesting that they both involve energy levels which are close in energy .",
    "thus , in the following sections , we _ do not _ consider the possibility of excitations within excited state ( @xmath97 ) manifolds .",
    "however , the simultaneous observation of @xmath61 and @xmath62 down to a frequency of 44  ghz ( fig .",
    "2 ) _ is not _ consistent with the simulations in fig .  3 , which assume aligned molecules .",
    "for this reason , we argue that the molecular easy - axes are not perfectly aligned , i.e. we propose a distribution of easy - axis alignments centered about the global four - fold axis of the crystal .",
    "this would result in overlapping angle dependent features ( such as those in figs .",
    "3 and  4 ) from different parts of the distribution , i.e. for a given field orientation one may observe @xmath17 peaks from tilted ( aligned ) molecules together with @xmath16 peaks due to aligned ( tilted ) molecules . as already discussed ,",
    "the origin for such a distribution can be understood in terms of solvent disorder .",
    "indeed , the calculations by cornia et al . predict easy - axis tilts of up to @xmath72.@xcite the absence of either @xmath61 or @xmath62 over an approximately @xmath83 range in the simulation in fig .",
    "3 suggests that the tilt distribution extends at least @xmath98 , since both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are observed in the 44  ghz spectra ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "in order to confirm the above hypothesis , we have recently carried out extremely precise angle - dependent measurements for @xmath40 rotations away from the hard plane ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "in contrast to earlier angle - dependent investigations within the hard plane ( @xmath41 rotations),@xcite which were achieved using a rotating split - pair magnet , the present study required fields exceeding those available in the split - pair . consequently , a unique cavity was designed and constructed , enabling in - situ rotation of the sample on the end - plate of the cylindrical cavity with an angle step of @xmath100 , and in fields of up to 45  tesla ( at the national high magnetic field laboratory ) .",
    "details concerning this cavity will be published elsewhere,@xcite and an account of our epr spectrometer is published in ref .  [ ] .",
    "the present investigation was carried out in a standard 9  tesla superconducting solenoid at the university of florida .",
    "the sample was positioned on the cavity end - plate so that the plane of rotation coincided approximately with one of the four large flat faces of the needle - shaped sample . based on comparisons with magnetic measurements,@xcite",
    "we believe that this plane of rotation is inclined approximately @xmath65 with respect to a plane containing the easy - axis and one of the hard four - fold axes , i.e. we believe @xmath101 in these investigations ( see fig .  6 below).@xcite single crystal samples of [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(ch@xmath4coo)@xmath5(h@xmath6o)@xmath7@xmath8 2ch@xmath4cooh@xmath9h@xmath6o were grown using literature methods.@xcite magnetic field dependent absorption was recorded at 15  k and at a frequency of 61.9  ghz , for field orientations roughly @xmath102 either side of the hard plane ( @xmath103 ) , in @xmath100 increments . the experimental spectra displayed in fig .  5 are presented in several different ways in order to aid direct comparison with fig .  4 .",
    "we note that the restricted bore size of our high - field magnet forced a lower bound on the resonance frequencies possible in the specially designed rotating cylindrical cavity.@xcite thus , high - field measurements below 61.9  ghz were not possible .    immediately apparent from fig .",
    "5 is the fact that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 peaks overlap over a substantial angle range ( @xmath104 ) @xmath105 particularly @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath106 whereas this is not the case in fig .  4 , thus providing direct confirmation for the tilt distribution .",
    "one also observes a weak @xmath62 peak in fig .",
    "5b for field alignment precisely within the hard plane ( @xmath49 ) ; in fact , @xmath62 is reduced below the @xmath107 level for only about @xmath72 either side of the hard plane , in comparison to its complete absence over a @xmath108 range in fig .",
    "all of these facts suggest that the easy axes of some of the molecules must be tilted by up to the order of @xmath68 , i.e. substantially greater than the tilts predicted by cornia et al.@xcite either that , or there exists a significant distribution of internal transverse fields within the sample .",
    "however , as previously discussed , this has been ruled out by previous authors.@xcite indeed , internal fields are rather weak,@xcite and can not explain the present observations . even for the worst possible sample shape , depolarization effects could account for no more than a @xmath78 distribution of field orientations at the applied field strengths employed in these investigations . a more subtle , yet significant , aspect of the data in fig .",
    "5 is the presence of shoulders on the high - field sides of most of the epr peaks ( see fig .",
    "these shoulders have been emphasized in fig .",
    "5c via the @xmath109 contour lines ( this corresponds to @xmath109 of the maximum absorption ) .",
    "such shoulders have been noted previously by us,@xcite and ascribed to the solvent - disorder - induced rhombic anisotropy first proposed by cornia et al.@xcite it is evident from figs .",
    "5a and  c that the shoulder persists over a narrower angle range , when compared to the main part of the epr absorption peaks , i.e. suppression of the shoulder relative to the main peak is quite abrupt , occurring close to @xmath110 for @xmath61 .",
    "the occurrence of distinct regions in the 3d absorption plot ( fig .",
    "5c ) , with distinct angle dependencies , is suggestive of a discrete form of disorder , as originally suggested in our earlier epr investigations.@xcite as will become apparent later in this article , the shoulder _ is _ attributable to a finite rhombic term .",
    "however , the angle dependence can not be ascribed to a rhombic term alone @xmath105 one must additionally consider the combined effects of easy - axis tilting and rhombicity .",
    "in doing this , one may understand the distinct angle dependence of the main peaks and the shoulders ( fig .",
    "5 ) as being due to molecules tilted in distinct ( orthogonal ) planes .",
    "the origin of two separate angle dependencies finds a natural explanation if one assumes that the easy - axis tilting and rhombicity are connected ( as predicted by cornia ) , and that the tilting is confined to directions determined by the principal axes of the rhombic zero - field tensor .",
    "we now assume that two of the mn@xmath0 variants originally discussed by cornia et al .",
    "( @xmath111 and @xmath112)@xcite have their easy axes tilted significantly , and that these tilts are confined to two orthogonal planes defined by the associated rhombic zero - field tensor and the global four - fold ( @xmath2- ) axis .",
    "the @xmath111 and @xmath112 variants comprise @xmath109 of the total number of molecules in cornia s model , and both species are predicted to have significant @xmath79 values ( @xmath113  @xmath34).@xcite of this @xmath109 , half of the molecules ( @xmath114 of the total @xmath60 the * a * molecules ) are expected to have their hard two - fold axes aligned along a single direction within the hard plane .",
    "then , because there exist four equivalent positions for the acetic acid of crystallization related by a four - fold rotation about @xmath2 , the remaining half of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 species ( @xmath114 of the total @xmath60 the * b * molecules ) will have their hard axes aligned @xmath77 away from the hard axes of the * a * molecules , i.e. parallel to the medium two - fold axes of the * a * molecules .",
    "this situation is depicted by the polar ( @xmath41- ) plot in the lower panel of fig .",
    "the two - fold hard axes are denoted @xmath115 , with the subscript * a * or * b * to distinguish between the two sub - sets of molecule .",
    "the orientations of these axes relative to the four - fold hard - axes ( @xmath116 at @xmath117 , @xmath77 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 ) is based on previous angle - dependent epr investigations for rotations within the hard plane , where it was determined that the principal axes of the @xmath79 and @xmath43 tensors were mis - aligned by @xmath120.@xcite next , we assume that the easy axis tilts are also confined along these two distinct / discrete directions , as indicated by the shaded regions in the lower panel of fig .  6 . in other words ,",
    "the well defined rhombic distortion and molecular easy axis tilting are directly related .",
    "based on the ensuing analysis , we find that molecules tilted in one of the two orthogonal planes have their @xmath115 axes perpendicular to that plane , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "thus , the * a * ( * b * ) molecules are tilted in a plane containing the @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) axis .",
    "it is now possible to see how one might expect two distinct angle dependencies for different parts of the epr spectrum , i.e. the shoulders and the main peaks . the thick purple arrow along @xmath123 ( and @xmath124 ) in the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 represents the best estimate ( _ vide infra _ ) of the plane of rotation for the epr spectra presented in fig .",
    "this plane is inclined closer to @xmath122 ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) than to @xmath121 ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) .",
    "therefore , for fields close to the hard plane ( @xmath49 ) , the rhombic term ( @xmath129 ) associated with the @xmath111 and @xmath112 variants will lead to different epr peak - position - shifts for the * a * and * b * molecules , thereby enabling one to resolve their contributions to the epr spectra for a sufficiently large @xmath79 value . in our experiments , the plane of rotation is closer to the tilt - plane for the * b * molecules than for the * a * molecules ( @xmath130 as opposed to @xmath131 ) . thus , the projection of the tilt distribution onto the plane of rotation is correspondingly greater for the * b * molecules than for the * a * molecules .",
    "the magnitudes of these projections scale as the @xmath132 of the angle ( @xmath133 ) between the field rotation plane and the corresponding tilt - plane . indeed , as explained later , it is on this basis that we deduced the orientation of the plane of rotation relative to @xmath122 and @xmath121 for the experiments presented in fig .",
    "the molecules having the greater projection of tilts onto the rotation plane will , thus , be expected to exhibit the greater spread in their associated epr spectra away from the hard plane . in this scenario",
    ", one may attribute the shoulders on the high - field sides of the main peaks in fig .  5 to the * a * molecules in fig .",
    "6 , since their tilt distribution will have a narrower projection onto the rotation plane ( see projections onto field rotation plane represented by blue and red dashed lines in fig .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the rotation plane is close to the hard axes of the * a * molecules is fully consistent with the appearance of the shoulder on the high - field sides of the main peaks ( assuming @xmath134 ) .",

    "furthermore , only half of these ( @xmath114 of the total ) are tilted in the plane of rotation . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the remaining @xmath109 of the molecules ( * c * ) do not possess a significant @xmath79-value . this is a slight simplification of cornia s model , since it is known that the @xmath135 trans species ( comprising @xmath136 of the molecules ) are predicted to have an @xmath79-value comparable to the @xmath111 and @xmath112 variants.@xcite however , one should first recall that cornia s calculations are approximate , and that our previous epr studies have indicated that the magnitudes of the @xmath79-values may have been underestimated.@xcite second , introducing too many different species would result in an over - parameterization of our model .",
    "the main purpose of the following simulation is to demonstrate that one can explain essentially all aspects of the single - crystal epr spectra for mn@xmath0-ac based on a simple model involving three just three molecular species , together with discrete easy - axis tilting , in the spirit of the original cornia proposal .",

    "7a and  b assume that the * a * and * b * molecules are tilted respectively along the @xmath122 and @xmath121 directions ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) i.e. the orientations of the tilt planes are  discrete .",

    "consequently , the epr intensity due to the * c * molecules contributes to the bulk of the central portion of the summed epr peaks ( fig .",
    "we included a small random ( i.e. not confined to planes ) distribution of tilts ( @xmath98 ) for the * c * molecules as a means of taking into account possible variations in the zero - field parameters / orientations associated with the four cornia variants ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath135 cis and trans ) which comprise this remaining @xmath109 of the molecules .",
    "it is the finite @xmath79-value associated with the * a * and * b * species which enables us to resolve the discrete nature of their tilting directions .",
    "we can not rule out similar properties for the remaining species ( * c * ) , but their smaller @xmath79-values do not allow us to observe such discrete behavior . thus , the choice of random tilts for the * c * molecules is quite arbitrary .",

    "agreement between experiment ( fig .  5 ) and",
    "the subsequent summation of the simulated spectra ( fig .",
    "8) is rather sensitive to the precise cut - off angle of @xmath140 for the tilt distribution of the * a * and * b * molecules ; however , it is not so sensitive to the exact shape of the distribution .",
    "for example , a discrete distribution with the * a * and * b * molecules all having precisely @xmath140 tilts along @xmath122 and @xmath121 reproduces many aspects of the experiments .",
    "however , such simulations contain many more fine structures which are averaged out by considering a smoother distribution such as the one employed in the fig .",
    "8 simulations . once again",
    ", we stress that this parameter set should not be viewed as definitive .",
    "however , we emphasize that , in order to simulate the main qualitative trends in the data ( e.g. the distinct angle dependencies of the main peaks and high - field shoulders ) , a discrete tilt distribution is necessary . as discussed above ,",
    "the simulations are not so sensitive to the shape of the tilt distribution within each tilt plane .",
    "thus , it is not easy to make direct comparisons with the distributions of tilts inferred by other methods.@xcite however , we note that only a small subset of the molecules ( @xmath114 ) , corresponding to half of the lowest symmetry cornia variants,@xcite are able to contribute to the anomalous epr intensity in our experiment . of these molecules , we can conclude that fewer than half ( @xmath144 of the total ) are tilted by more than @xmath82 .",
    "while comparisons between the gray - scale plots are not so sensitive to the @xmath79-value , comparisons between simulated and actual experimental spectra are extremely sensitive to @xmath79 ( see fig .  10 below ) ; the value of @xmath145  @xmath34 gives the best agreement with a wide body of single - crystal data collected over several years.@xcite this @xmath79 value is also in excellent agreement with a recent first principles calculation by park et al.@xcite    as discussed above , the relative angle ( @xmath133 ) between the field rotation plane and the * a * and * b * tilt - planes ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively ) was chosen so that the epr peaks corresponding to the * a * and * b * molecules ( figs .",
    "7a and  b ) cover the same angle ranges as the high - field shoulders ( @xmath146 for @xmath61 ) and the central portions of the peaks ( @xmath147 for @xmath61 ) respectively in fig .",
    "the best agreement was obtained with the field rotation plane oriented @xmath130 away from @xmath122 ( fig .",
    "thus , we estimate that the @xmath122 and @xmath121 axes are oriented @xmath148 and @xmath149 with respect to the sample faces , while the hard four - fold axes are roughly @xmath150 away ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , which also agrees with magnetic and structural data.@xcite the simulated spectra obtained according to the aforementioned procedure were then normalized and summed in the ratio * a*:*b*:*c *  @xmath151  @xmath152 .",
    "the results of this summation are displayed in fig .",
    "agreement with the experimental data in fig .",
    "5 is quite impressive .",
    "first and foremost , the simulations including tilts account for essentially all of the anomalous aspects of the data which could not be explained without tilts ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "for example : the @xmath61 and @xmath62 peaks overlap by about @xmath83 between roughly @xmath153 and @xmath154 ; the @xmath62 peak disappears ( below the @xmath155 level ) over a roughly @xmath156 range either side of @xmath157 . there is also clear evidence for a shoulder on the high - field sides of the main epr peaks , although this shoulder is more apparent in fig .",
    "5a than 5b .",
    "the overall widths and shapes of the resonances are also reproduced fairly well , including the broad low - field tail and the fairly abrupt decrease in intensity on the high - field sides of the peaks ( a 0.1  tesla gaussian lineshape was employed in the individual simulations in fig .",
    "we note from fig .  5 that an extremely weak @xmath95 signal persists even for fields parallel to the hard plane .",
    "we were unable to reproduce this behavior in the simulations while , at the same time , maintaining good agreement with other aspects of the experimental data , e.g. the angle range of overlap between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 resonances .",
    "we therefore speculate that this weak remnant signal may be due to excitations within a higher lying @xmath91 state , as previously proposed by us.@xcite however , more careful temperature dependent studies will be required in order to establish the location of this excited state relative to the @xmath20 ground state .",
    "indeed , recent measurements on a related high symmetry mn@xmath0 species ( without significant easy axis tilting ) have enabled precisely such an analysis.@xcite    having satisfactorily reproduced the spectra for out - of - plane rotations ( figs .  5 and  8) ,",
    "we consider previously published spectra obtained as a function of the field orientation @xmath41 within the hard plane.@xcite one of the puzzling questions concerning these earlier measurements concerned the observation of only a single satellite peak ( shoulder ) on the high - field side of resonances for some field orientations .",
    "the modulation of the widths of the epr peaks was originally explained in terms of the cornia model.@xcite so why does one never see both low - field and high - field shoulders , corresponding to the positive and negative epr line - position - shifts induced by the different signs of the rhombic term ? we note that , for a field along @xmath122 ( @xmath121 ) , one expects an upward ( downward ) shift in field of the absorption due to the * a * molecules , together with a downward ( upward ) shift due to the * b * molecules .",
    "the apparent explanation is illustrated in fig .",
    "9 , which displays the evolution of absorption due to one of the tilted species ( either * a * or * b * ) as a function of the field orientation ( within the hard plane ) relative to the hard two - fold axis for that species ; note @xmath105 this is not the same as the angle @xmath41 . with the field along the hard two - fold axis @xmath115 ( @xmath158 in fig .  9 )",
    ", the resonance occurs at the highest field position , while the projected distribution of tilts onto the rotation plane is at its narrowest .",
    "consequently , the epr peak is narrow .",
    "conversely , with the field along the medium two - fold axis ( @xmath159 in fig .",
    "9 ) , the resonance occurs at the lowest field position , and the projected distribution of tilts onto the rotation plane is at its broadest , resulting in a broader epr peak .",
    "conservation of the area under the peaks additionally requires that the @xmath160 peak be more intense at its maximum than the @xmath161 peak .",
    "the result is that the broad low - field shoulder does not quite get resolved from the main * c * peak , whereas the sharp high - field peak is resolved for several of the resonances @xmath105 particularly @xmath61 and @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , the low - field @xmath161 peak contributes significantly to the slow decay of the @xmath61 resonance on its low - field side , thus accounting for another previously unexplained feature of the mn@xmath0-ac single - crystal epr spectra .",
    "we note that recent experiments on deuterated samples reveal shoulders on both the low and high field sides of the main resonances.@xcite    knowing the relative orientations of the principal axes associated with the @xmath79 and @xmath43 tensors , we can simulate the full hard - plane angle dependence published previously,@xcite as shown in figs .",
    "10 to  12 .",
    "we note that , while the misalignment of the @xmath79 and @xmath43 tensors has previously been suggested from x - ray structure measurements , the epr studies in ref .",
    "[ ] clearly illustrate that the magnetic properties of mn@xmath0-ac reflect this misalignment .",
    "10 displays the simulated spectra as a function of the field orientation @xmath41 relative to one of the hard four - fold axes ( @xmath116 ) . these spectra can be compared directly with fig .  1 of ref .",
    "[ ] , albeit that the frequencies are slightly different ( 50  ghz in ref .  [ ] and 62  ghz in the present case ) .",
    "the previously published spectra do not include the highest field @xmath61 resonance due to the limitations of the split - pair magnet used in those investigations ; one should also be careful to note the different labeling scheme used in this and earlier studies.@xcite the splitting of @xmath85 ( highest field peak in ref .",
    "[ ] ) is reproduced very precisely , as are the amplitudes of the linewidths ( full - width - at - half - maximum @xmath105 fwhm ) variations with angle , as displayed in fig .  11 for peaks @xmath162 to @xmath85 .",
    "again , these are the same four linewidths plotted in fig .  2a of ref .",
    "the maximum linewidth or splitting caused by the disorder - induced rhombic anisotropy is observed at @xmath163 and @xmath164 relative to the @xmath116 axes ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , and the widths are in fair agreement with the @xmath79-value used in the present simulations .",
    "the orientations of the linewidth maxima , which correspond to the hard and medium two - fold axes ( @xmath122 and @xmath121 ) are , therefore , oriented at @xmath149 and @xmath148 relative to the crystal faces .",
    "the @xmath165 and @xmath166 symbols are used here to reflect the inversion symmetry of the crystal .",
    "we note that the linewidth minima are somewhat deeper in the simulation ( fig .",
    "11 ) , as compared to experiment.@xcite this is most likely due to other sources of line broadening ( d - strain , g - strain , etc .. ) which were not taken into consideration in our model .",
    "the main point of this simulation is to once again show that the four - fold oscillation in the linewidth / splitting is related to the @xmath79-strain , and that the model employed in this study is in complete agreement with our earlier investigations .",

    "12 clearly illustrates the four - fold variation in the line positions caused by the intrinsic four - fold @xmath167 transverse anisotropy .",

    "12 is an excellent reproduction of the contour plot in fig .  1 of ref .",

[ ] to estimate the rhombic @xmath79-term associated with the low - symmetry mn@xmath0 variants , and is supported by independent magnetization studies.@xcite contrary to recent assertions,@xcite the epr linewidths are not used in our determination of the easy - axis tilting , which has been inferred entirely from the angle - dependent intensities of the epr spectra .    finally , having reproduced the full angle dependence at a single temperature of 15  k , we display in fig .  13 a simulation of the older temperature dependent data shown in fig .  2",

    ", the simulation assumes that the field was applied along the @xmath116 axis ( i.e. @xmath169 ) .",
    "agreement between the simulations and the experiment is extremely good .",
    "using angle - resolved single - crystal high - frequency epr measurements , we have clearly demonstrated that the molecular easy axes associated with the widely studied mn@xmath0-ac single - molecule magnet are tilted on a local scale .",
    "this tilting provides the much sought - after source of the transverse fields necessary to explain the observation of odd resonant tunneling steps in hysteresis experiments , i.e. the tilt distribution results in a transverse internal field distribution , even when the field is applied precisely parallel to the global easy - axis of the crystal .",
    "more importantly , on the basis of the angle - dependence of fine structures observed in the epr spectra , we infer that the tilts are constrained along orthogonal planes , i.e. there is a discrete aspect to the tilts , as was previously suspected from studies which demonstrated the presence of a locally varying rhombic anisotropy.@xcite this behavior is completely reproducible in mn@xmath0-ac samples prepared by different methods and by different groups.@xcite furthermore , our analysis is insensitive to the intricacies associated with lineshape analyses , which could be influenced by complex many - body effects , e.g. magnetic spin - spin interactions.@xcite therefore , this study provides compelling support for the recent predictions by cornia et al.,@xcite who have suggested that a discrete form of disorder associated with the acetic acid of crystallization provides the dominant source of transverse anisotropy responsible for the magnetic quantum tunneling in mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "thus , one can rule out suggestions that dislocations may be responsible for the symmetry lowering at the local scale , since one would not expect the easy axis tilting to be confined to discrete planes under such a scenario.@xcite    while our data agree with many qualitative aspects of the cornia model,@xcite the magnitudes of the easy - axis tilting angles ( up to @xmath170 ) , and the rhombic anisotropy associated with the tilted molecules ( @xmath79 up to @xmath141  @xmath34 ) , are both significantly larger than the predicted values ( by a factor of about 5 ) .",
    "these results should , therefore , be of significant theoretical interest , forming a basis for more refined structure calculations such as those recently published by park et al.@xcite we tentatively ascribe the observed tilting to the hydrogen - bonding between the two acetic acid solvent molecules per mn@xmath0-ac .",
