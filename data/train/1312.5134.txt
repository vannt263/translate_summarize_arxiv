    "in @xcite , moore and read showed that a number of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states can be expressed as certain correlators of conformal fields .",
    "more recently it has been shown that such a connection also holds for fqh states in lattice systems @xcite and for the interpolation between lattice and continuum systems @xcite .",
    "the construction is interesting because it shows that the states can be seen as special cases of a more general mathematical framework .",
    "it also means that the states fulfil certain mathematical relations inherited from conformal field theory ( cft ) , and these are useful for deriving various properties of the states .",
    "examples include the possibility to derive parent hamiltonians , to study quasi particle or edge excitations , to investigate entanglement spectra and to derive correlation functions @xcite .",
    "we shall here focus on a lattice version of the bosonic laughlin state at filling factor @xmath1 , which is known as the kalmeyer - laughlin ( kl ) state @xcite . on the riemann sphere ,",
    "i.e. , the complex plane combined with the point at infinity , the kl state takes the form @xmath2 this wavefunction describes a state of @xmath3 bosonic particles on a two - dimensional square or triangular lattice , and @xmath4 is the position of the @xmath5th particle written as a complex number .",
    "the factor @xmath6 is a gauge factor that is included to ensure that the state is a singlet , @xmath7 for all @xmath5 and the rest of the expression on the right hand side of is the bosonic laughlin state at filling factor @xmath1 , except that the possible values of the positions @xmath4 are restricted to the considered lattice .",
    "the kl state has also been studied on a square lattice on the torus @xcite , and we provide an expression for this state in section [ sec : kl ] .",
    "the kl state and closely related states have been analyzed in several papers , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these analyses show that the kl state has the same topological properties as the bosonic laughlin state at half filling in the continuum .",
    "the investigated properties include , e.g. , correlation functions , the fractional statistics of quasiparticle excitations , the chiral edge states , and topological entanglement entropy .",
    "parent hamiltonians have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the huge interest in the kl state is due to its topological and chiral spin liquid properties combined with a relatively simple analytical wavefunction defined on a lattice . to characterize the properties of topological quantum states a number of different measures",
    "have been proposed , but more of these requires the state under investigation to be defined with a particular set of boundary conditions , e.g.  periodic boundary conditions that correspond to defining the state on a torus .",
    "it is therefore very relevant to study different geometries .    in the present paper ,",
    "we demonstrate that the kl states on the torus can be expressed as chiral correlators of fields from the @xmath0 wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model .",
    "it has previously been shown @xcite that this construction gives a kl - like state when considered on the riemann sphere , and the present study extends this result to the torus geometry , where the relation to the kl state turns out to be exact .",
    "the cft correlators can be defined for arbitrary lattices in 2d and are ensured to be singlets by construction .",
    "the cft states thus provide a generalization of the kl states on the torus to arbitrary lattices , and by investigating the topological properties of the states on different lattices , we provide evidence that the topology remains the same at least for a broad class of lattices . for the case of square lattices with @xmath8 spins",
    ", we also find linear combinations of the cft states that are eigenstates of various symmetry operators .",
    "in particular , this allows us in certain cases to identify linear combinations of the states that are guaranteed to be orthogonal .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : wfcft ] , we explain how wavefunctions can be constructed from conformal fields .",
    "we also introduce the cft states that we study in this work and provide analytical expressions for them on the riemann sphere and torus geometries . in section [ sec : cblock ] , we derive the analytical expressions for the cft states on the torus . in section [ sec : kl ] , we show that the cft states are proportional to the kl states on the torus when defined on a square lattice . in section [ sec : trans ] , we study the symmetry properties of the cft states for the case of a square lattice .",
    "in particular , we find linear combinations of the two states that are eigenstates of different transformation operators and their eigenvalues . in section [ sec : chern ] , we discuss the topological properties of the states , and we find among other things that the many - body chern number of the states is unity for several different lattices .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper , [ sec : appa ] summarizes the definition and some properties of riemann theta functions and [ sec : appb ] provides an alternative derivation of the singlet property of the states for four spins . to provide readers who are more interested in the concepts than the derivations with a faster route through the paper , we start sections [ sec : cblock ] , [ sec : kl ] and [ sec : trans ] with a summary of the results derived in the section",
    "we first explain how states of spin systems can be constructed from conformal fields .",
    "our starting point is the correlator @xmath9 of @xmath10 primary fields @xmath11 of a cft . here",
    ", @xmath12 stands for the vacuum expectation value , @xmath13 is a coordinate in the complex plane , and @xmath14 is the complex conjugate of @xmath13 . the field @xmath11 has spin @xmath15 , and it therefore has @xmath16 components @xmath17 , where @xmath18 labels the @xmath16 possible values of the third component of the spin .",
    "it follows that is a vector with @xmath19 components .",
    "the correlator can be broken up into a sum over terms corresponding to different ways of fusing the fields present in the correlator to the vacuum state . utilizing also that the field @xmath11 separates into a holomorphic and an antiholomorphic part ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath20 , we can write the components of as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a conformal block ( also known as a chiral correlator ) , @xmath23 labels the different ways of fusing the fields to the vacuum state , and the bar means complex conjugation .",
    "the next step is to regard @xmath24 as the components of a wavefunction @xmath25 describing the state of @xmath10 spins with spin quantum numbers @xmath26 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a normalization constant that allows us to choose the normalization of @xmath30 after convenience .",
    "the complex coordinates @xmath31 are fixed parameters of the wavefunction and are naturally interpreted as the physical positions @xmath32 of the spins in the two - dimensional plane . in other words ,",
    "the choice of @xmath33 defines the lattice under consideration .",
    "note that arbitrary lattices can be considered , since the only restriction on @xmath33 is that @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "in the present paper , we shall take the cft to be the wzw model based on the kac - moody algebra @xmath0 .",
    "this cft has central charge @xmath36 and two primary fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 with spin 0 and spin @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 has conformal weight @xmath39 , and @xmath38 has conformal weight @xmath40 .",
    "since the spin-@xmath41 primary field is the identity , we shall take all the fields in the correlator to be spin-@xmath1 primary fields .",
    "the number of conformal blocks is dictated by the fusion rules @xmath42 the fields can only fuse to the identity if @xmath10 is even , and we shall therefore assume this to be the case throughout .",
    "the number of conformal blocks on a riemann surface with genus @xmath43 is then @xmath44 .",
    "there is hence one state on the riemann sphere ( @xmath45 ) and two states on the torus ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the state on the riemann sphere ( complex plane ) can be written as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 can take only one value and @xmath49 is defined such that the @xmath50-component of the spin of the @xmath5th field is @xmath51 .",

    "we use here the scaled coordinates @xmath72 , but we note that this changes the correlator only by a constant factor . note that the conformal weight of @xmath73 is @xmath74 , as it should be .",
