    "many - body systems with long - range - interacting forces are very important in nature , the primary example being gravitation .",
    "long - ranged systems deviate significantly from the conventional ` well behaved ' systems in many respects .",
    "various features like ergodicity breakdown , ensemble inequivalence , non - mixing nonlinear dynamics , partial ( possibly hierarchical ) occupancy of phase space , thermodynamical nonextensivity for the total energy , longstanding metastable states , phase transitions even in one dimension , and other anomalies , can be observed in systems with long - range interactions .",
    "consistently , some of the usual premises of boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics are challenged and an alternative thermostatistical description of these systems becomes necessary in many instances .",
    "for some decades now , @xmath17-statistics @xcite has been a useful formalism to study such systems , and has led to satisfactory experimental validations for a wide variety of complex systems ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the deep understanding of the microscopical nonlinear dynamics of such systems naturally constitutes a must in order to theoretically legitimize the efficiency of the @xmath17-generalization of the bg theory . for classical systems such as many - body hamiltonian ones and low - dimensional maps , a crucial aspect concerns the sensitivity to the initial conditions , which is characterized by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents . if the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath6 is positive , mixing and ergodicity are essentially warranted , and we consequently expect the bg entropy and statistical mechanics to be applicable .",
    "if instead @xmath6 vanishes , the sensitivity to the initial conditions is subexponential , typically a power - law with time , and we might expect nonadditive entropies such as @xmath18 and its associated statistical mechanics to emerge , as has been observed numerically as well as experimentally in many systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "in the present paper we extend to @xmath0-dimensions ( @xmath1 ) and numerically study from first principles ( i.e. , using only newton s law @xmath19 ) the celebrated fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model with periodic boundary conditions ; nonlinear long - range interactions between all the @xmath20 oscillators are allowed as well .",
    "the hamiltonian is the following one : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the displacement and momentum of the @xmath24-th particle with mass @xmath25 ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the shortest euclidean distance between the @xmath24-th and @xmath29-th lattice sites ( @xmath30 ) ; this distance depends on the geometry of the lattice ( ring , periodic square or cubic lattices ) .",
    "thus for @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 if @xmath14 ( @xmath37 ) we have short - range ( long - range ) interactions in the sense that the potential energy per particle converges ( diverges ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath38 ; in particular , the @xmath39 limit corresponds to only first - neighbor interactions , and the @xmath40 value corresponds to typical mean field approaches , when the coupling constant is assumed to be independent from distance .",
    "the instance @xmath41 recovers the original @xmath42-fpu hamiltonian , that has been profusely studied in the literature ; the @xmath43 model and generic @xmath44 has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "although not necessary ( see @xcite ) , we have followed the current use and have made the hamiltonian extensive for all values of @xmath13 by adopting the scaling factor @xmath45 in the quartic coupling , where @xmath46 hence , @xmath45 depends on @xmath47 , and the geometry of the lattice .",
    "note that for @xmath48 we have @xmath49 , which recovers the rescaling usually introduced in mean field approaches . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath45 remains constant for @xmath14 , whereas @xmath51 for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 for @xmath15 ) ; see details in @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us mention that the analytical thermostatistical approach of the present model is in some sense even harder than that of coupled xy or heisenberg rotators already addressed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the standard bg approach of these models is analytically tractable , whereas not even that appears to be possible for the original fpu , not to say anything for the present generalization .",
    "therefore , for this kind of many - body hamiltonians , the numerical approach appears to be the only tractable one .    to numerically solve the equations of motion (",
    "newton s law ) we have employed the symplectic second order accurate velocity verlet algorithm . to accelerate the computationally expensive part of the force calculation routine we have exploited the convolution theorem and used a fast fourier transform algorithm .",
    "this yields a considerable reduction in the number of operations for force calculation from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , thus facilitating computation for larger system sizes and longer times .",
    "we choose the time step @xmath56 ( which is typically @xmath57 for most of our results ) such that the standard deviation of the energy density over the entire simulation time ( i.e. , the number of iterations required by the maximal lyapunov exponent to saturate , which is typically @xmath58 iterations , depending on system parameters ) is of the order of @xmath59 or smaller ( for the range of @xmath5 considered here , @xmath60 ) .",
    "starting from a random initial displacements @xmath22 drawn from a uniform distribution centered around zero , and momenta @xmath23 from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance , we evolve the system and compute the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath6 defined as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the metric distance between the fiducial orbit and the reference orbit having initial displacement @xmath63 .",
    "we numerically compute this quantity by using the algorithm by benettin et al @xcite . for typical values of the exponent @xmath44 ,",
    "we compute @xmath6 as a function of the system size @xmath5 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "let us now present the results of our numerical analysis by setting @xmath66 ( no loss of generality ) , and fixing the energy density @xmath67 and @xmath68 for all @xmath0 , unless stated otherwise , where @xmath69 is the total energy associated with @xmath70 .",
    "additionally , we have set the harmonic term to zero , i.e. @xmath71 , for reasons that will be elaborated later .",
    "in fact such a model , with only the quartic anharmonic nearest neighbor interactions , has been studied previously in the context of heat conduction @xcite .    in figs . [",
    "fig : fpu1da0 ] , [ fig : fpu2da0 ] and [ fig : fpu3da0 ] we present , for @xmath721 , 2 and 3 respectively , the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath6 as a function of the system size for typical values of the exponent @xmath44 .",
    "we find that , for @xmath73 , @xmath6 saturates to a positive value with increasing @xmath5 , which strongly suggests that it will remain so for @xmath50 , thus leading to ergodicity , which in turn legitimizes the bg thermostatistical theory .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath74 , @xmath6 algebraically decays with @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and depends on @xmath78 . assuming that it remains so for increasingly large @xmath5",
    ", we expect @xmath79 , which implies that the entire lyapunov spectrum vanishes .",
    "this characterizes weak chaos for @xmath80 , i.e. , subexponential sensitivity to the initial conditions , which opens the door for breakdown of mixing , or of ergodicity , or some other nonlinear dynamical anomaly . within this scenario ,",
    "the violation of boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics in the @xmath50 limit becomes strongly plausible ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    from the results illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fpu1da0 ] , [ fig : fpu2da0 ] and [ fig : fpu3da0 ] we compute the exponent @xmath81 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa_a_mul ] , including its inset .",
    "we find that @xmath82 for @xmath74 , and , within numerical accuracy , vanishes for @xmath73 .",
    "also note that @xmath83 decreases for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "remarkably enough , all three curves in the inset of fig . [ fig : kappa_a_mul ] can be made to collapse onto a single curve through the scalings @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this is shown in the main figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa_a_mul ] . _ in other words , @xmath86 where @xmath87 appears to be a universal function .",
    "_    a similar scaling was also verified for the classical model of long - ranged coupled rotators @xcite .",
    "some relevant differences exist however between the two models and their sensitivities to initial conditions .",
    "the long - range - interacting planar rotator model exhibits , for a critical energy density @xmath88 @xcite , a second order phase transition from a clustered phase ( ferromagnetic ) to a homogeneous one ( paramagnetic ) .",
    "such critical phenomenon does not exist in either the short - ranged or the long - ranged fpu model . for the xy ferromagnetic model the exponent @xmath11 for @xmath48 is found to be independent from @xmath0 ( quite obvious since the @xmath40 model has no dimension ) and given by @xmath89 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , our long - range model yields a value @xmath83 which depends on @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath90 1 , 2 and 3 , we respectively obtain @xmath91 1/3 , 1/4 and 1/5 .",
    "this difference in @xmath83 is related to the fact that , for the xy model , the number of degrees of freedom ( number of independent variables needed to specify the state of the system in phase space ) for @xmath5 coupled rotators in @xmath0 dimensions is @xmath92 , whereas , for our model , there are @xmath93 degrees of freedom , hence the dimension of the full phase space grows linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "thus there are more possible phase space dimensions for our coupled oscillator system to escape even if gets somewhat trapped in some non - chaotic region of the phase space .",
    "consequently , the system gets closer to ergodicity ( equivalently , @xmath11 gets closer to zero ) for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "it is even not excluded that , because of some generic reason of this kind , @xmath94 for the long - ranged xy model and @xmath95 for the system studied here , we obtain ( in absence of the integrable term , i.e. , with @xmath96 ) the same value @xmath97 .    in this context",
    "we should mention another recent study @xcite of the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model which is the @xmath48 particular case of the long - ranged xy model discussed above . using numerical and analytical arguments",
    "it was suggested that the nature of chaos is quite different for this model ( which has a phase transition at @xmath98 ) in the homogeneous phase ( @xmath99 ) where @xmath100 , the ordered phase ( @xmath101 ) where @xmath6 remains positive and finite , and at criticality ( @xmath102 ) where @xmath103 in the infinite size limit .",
    "however in another earlier work @xcite , using scaling arguments and numerical simulations , it was observed that @xmath104 below the critical point ( @xmath105 ) in the ( non equilibrium ) quasi - stationary regime of the hmf system .",
    "another class of models might also have a similar behavior .",
    "if we consider the @xmath0-dimensional long - range - interacting @xmath106-vector ferromagnet , we expect an exponent @xmath107 .",
    "we know that for @xmath108 ( xy symmetry ) @xmath109 , for @xmath110 ( classical heisenberg model symmetry ) @xmath111 @xcite , and for @xmath112 ( spherical model symmetry ) most plausibly @xmath113 .",
    "these expressions can be simply unified through @xmath114 .",
    "strikingly enough , the present fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa_a_mul ] and fig .",
    "2 of @xcite for the @xmath0-dimensional xy model are numerically indistinguishable within error bars .",
    "this suggests the following heuristic expression : @xmath115 where this specific analytic expression for @xmath87 has been first suggested in @xcite .",
    "this or a similar universal behavior is expected to hold for @xmath0-dimensional long - range - interacting many - body models such as the present one , the xy ferromagnetic one , and others such as , for instance , the @xmath106-vector ferromagnetic one ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "-0.3 cm -0.3 cm    all the numerical results presented until now are with a fixed set of parameters @xmath117 and a fixed time step @xmath56 . before concluding , let us briefly mention some results concerning the influence of these parameters on @xmath118 and @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters]a we plot @xmath119 for @xmath31 for three different sets of @xmath120 keeping all other parameters unchanged .",
    "we find that increasing @xmath121 has the same effect as increasing @xmath122  the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath6 increases with both of them but the slope of the curve @xmath11 remains practically unaltered .",
    "for @xmath96 , it is straightforward to show that the average of hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) remains invariant with respect to @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( all other parameters remaining the same ) under the transformations    @xmath123    the second transformation in eq .",
    "( [ transform ] ) implies that the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath6 ( @xmath124 ) satisfies the following scaling relation :    @xmath125    using the data in the main figure , we show in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters]a the variation of @xmath126 with @xmath5 .",
    "as predicted by the scaling analysis , we get an excellent data collapse of the three curves .",
    "this is precisely as desired , keeping in mind the universal behavior ubiquitously found in statistical mechanics , in the sense that scaling indices , such as @xmath11 here , are generically expected to be independent of the microscopic details of the model .    for nonzero values of @xmath127 , the simple scaling eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) disappears , and @xmath118 shows a saturation to a positive value that vanishes for @xmath96 when @xmath5 is large , @xmath121 being a finite positive number .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters]b for two values of @xmath127 with the same value of @xmath121 .",
    "the saturation of @xmath6 for @xmath128 needs careful study to be understood properly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters]c we have shown ( for @xmath33 ) that increasing @xmath56 can also lead to a deviation from the @xmath129 behavior ; this deviation is quite expected , and one should choose the time step judiciously .",
    "note that the saturation behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters]b is not due to finiteness of the time step .",
    "summarizing , we have introduced a @xmath0-dimensional generalization of the celebrated fermi - pasta - ulam model which allows for long - range nonlinear interaction between the oscillators , whose coupling constant decays as @xmath130 .",
    "we have then focused on the sensitivity to initial conditions , more precisely on the first - principle ( based on newton s law ) calculation of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath6 as a function of the number @xmath5 of oscillators using large - scale numerical simulations . without the quadratic nearest neighbor interaction ( i.e. , @xmath71 )",
    ", @xmath118 appears to asymptotically behave as @xmath9 ( with @xmath131 ) for @xmath52 , and approach a positive constant ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) for @xmath8 in the @xmath38 thermodynamic limit .",
    "our results provide strong indication that @xmath11 only depends on @xmath78 , and does so in a universal manner , namely @xmath133 for @xmath52 , and @xmath132 for @xmath14 .",
    "this universal suppression of strong chaos is well approximated by a model - independent heuristic function @xmath134 , previously found @xcite for the @xmath0-dimensional xy model of coupled rotators .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit , these systems ( and plausibly others as well ) have a sort of critical point at @xmath15 , which separates the ergodic @xmath8 region ( where the boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics is valid , and the stationary state distribution of velocities is the standard maxwellian one ) , from the weakly chaotic @xmath10 region with anomalous nonlinear dynamical behavior ( where @xmath17-statistics might be expected to be valid , and the one - body distribution of velocities appears to be of the @xmath17-gaussian form , consistently with preliminary results available in the literature @xcite ) .",
    "the present universality scaling for @xmath135 enables the conjecture that the indices @xmath17 of the distributions of velocities and of energies might exist and only depend on the ratio @xmath13 .",
