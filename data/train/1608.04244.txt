    "this extends the framework of cui , hrdle and zhu ( 2011 ) where the conditional variance of the response is proportional to a given function of the conditional mean .",
    "our first contribution is to propose a new semiparametric estimation procedure for single - index regression which incorporates the additional information on the conditional variance of @xmath1 . for this",
    "we extend the quasi - generalized pseudo maximum likelihood method introduced by gouriroux , monfort and trognon ( 1984a , 1984b ) to a semiparametric framework .",
    "more precisely , we propose to estimate @xmath7 and the function @xmath14 through a two - step pseudo - maximum likelihood ( pml ) procedure based on _ linear exponential families _ _ with nuisance parameter _ densities .",
    "such densities are parameterized by the mean @xmath8 and a nuisance parameter that can be recovered from the variance .",
    "although we use a likelihood type criterion , no conditional distribution assumption on @xmath1 given @xmath2 is required for deriving the asymptotic results .    as an example of application of our procedure",

    "the estimate of @xmath17 and of the regression function may be sensitive to the choice of the smoothing parameter .",
    "another contribution of this paper is to propose an automatic and natural choice of the smoothing parameter used to define the semiparametric estimator . for this",

    "the idea is to maximize the pseudo - likelihood simultaneously in @xmath15 and the smoothing parameter , that is the bandwidth of the kernel estimator .",
    "the bandwidth is allowed to belong to a large range between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in some sense",
    ", this approach considers the bandwidth an auxiliary parameter for which the pseudo - likelihood may provide an estimate . using a suitable decomposition of the pseudo - log - likelihood",
    "we show that such a joint maximization is asymptotically equivalent to separate maximization of a purely parametric ( nonlinear ) term with respect to @xmath15 and minimization of a weighted ( mean - squared ) cross - validation function with respect to the bandwidth .",
    "the weights of this cross - validation function are given by the second order derivatives of the pseudo - log - likelihood with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the rate of our ` optimal ' bandwidth is @xmath20 , as expected for twice differentiable regression functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ metoda ]",
    "we introduce a class of semiparametric pml estimators based on linear exponential densities with nuisance parameter and we provide a natural bandwidth choice .",
    "moreover , we present the general methodology used for the asymptotics .",
    "section [ rezultat ] contains the asymptotic results .",
    "a bound for the variance of our semiparametric pml estimators is also derived . in section [ twostep ]",

    "section [ simulsec ] examines the finite - sample properties of our procedure via monte carlo simulations .",
    "we compare the performances of a two - step generalized least - squares with those of a negative binomial pml in a poisson single - index regression model with multiplicative unobserved heterogeneity . even if the two procedures considered lead to asymptotically equivalent estimates , the latter procedure seems preferable in finite samples .",
