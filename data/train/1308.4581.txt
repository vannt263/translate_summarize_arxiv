    "it is known that decoherence is one of the most important obstacles in quantum information processing , since it causes a quantum computer to lose its quantum properties destroying its performance advantages over a classical computer .",
    "there are different methods for preserving quantum coherence . one possible technique exploits redundancy in encoding information .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , one might think that redundancy can not be of any use in quantum computing , since quantum states can not be cloned @xcite .",
    "however , using the property of quantum entanglement , shor and steane discovered a clever scheme for exploiting redundancy @xcite . this scheme is known as _",
    "quantum error correcting codes _ ( qeccs ) . for a comprehensive introduction to qeccs ,",
    "we refer to @xcite . within such scheme",
    ", information is encoded in linear subspaces ( codes ) of the total hilbert space in such a way that errors induced by the interaction with the environment can be detected and corrected .",
    "the qeccs approach may be interpreted as an active stabilization of a quantum state in which , by monitoring the system and conditionally carrying on suitable operations , one prevents the loss of information . in detail",
    ", the errors occur on a qubit when its evolution differs from the ideal one .",
    "this happens by interaction of the qubit with an environment .    among the first and most famous qeccs",
    ", there are the shor nine - qubit code @xcite , the calderbank - shor - steane seven - qubit code @xcite and the perfect @xmath0-error correcting five - qubit code @xcite with transmission rate equal to @xmath1 . in general",
    ", scientists aim at searching for new quantum codes capable of combatting very general error models and correcting for arbitrary errors at unknown positions in the codeword . these results , in general , have more theoretical than practical importance , since they assume the existence of a fairly sophisticated quantum computer which has not been built yet .",
    "fortunately , in many realistic situations , additional information on possible errors is available .",
    "ideally , this knowledge should be taken into consideration in order to construct the simplest code with the highest transmission rate that can have a good chance to be implemented in a real laboratory .",
    "we stress _ ideally _ since , in general , it is a difficult problem to design quantum codes for any particular noise model .",
    "for instance , there are quantum systems for which the noise leads to dephasing errors only or bit - flip errors only .",
    "it has been shown that for such restricted types of decoherence , it is possible to perform error correction of one arbitrary dephasing / bit - flip error by encoding a single logical qubit into a minimum of three physical qubits @xcite . furthermore , uncovering efficient codes for restricted error models may be important for proof of principle demonstrations of quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "consider an error model where the position of the erroneous qubits is known .",
    "such errors at known positions are denoted as _ erasures _",
    "@xcite__. _ _ a @xmath2-error correcting code is a @xmath3-erasure correcting code .",
    "also , while @xmath1 is the highest rate for a @xmath0-error correcting code , four qubits are sufficient for a code to correct one arbitrary erasure . omitting suitable normalization factors",
    ", the perfect four - qubit code for the correction of one erasure reads @xcite,@xmath4 in general , when no knowledge on the noise model is assumed , the errors to be corrected are completely random .",
    "this scenario may lead to the error correction of pauli - type errors @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 that occur with equal probability @xmath11 ( symmetric depolarizing channel , @xcite ) .",
    "however , if further information about an error process is available , more efficient codes can be designed as pointed out earlier . as a matter of fact , in many physical systems ,",
    "the types of noise are likely to be unbalanced between amplitude ( @xmath5-type ) and phase ( @xmath7-type ) errors .",
    "these are asymmetric error models which are still described by kraus operators that are ( unitary ) pauli matrices ( pauli kraus operators ) .",
    "however , there are types of noise models seen in realistic settings that are not described by pauli kraus operators and , for these cases as well , the task of constructing good error correcting codes is very challenging .",
    "the amplitude damping ( ad ) channel is the simplest nonunital channel whose kraus operators can not be described by ( unitary ) pauli operations @xcite .",
    "the two kraus operators for ad noise are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the damping rate ( or , damping probability parameter ) .",
    "as we may observe , there is no simple way of reducing @xmath15 to one pauli error operator since @xmath16 is not normal .",
    "observe that @xmath17 , therefore the linear span of @xmath15 and @xmath18 equals the linear span of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "if the quantum system interacts with an environment at finite temperature , the kraus operator @xmath18 will appear in the noise model ( as stressed in @xcite , the error space to be corrected is a subspace of that spanned by the interaction operators , selected by the initial state of the environment ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , if a code is capable of correcting @xmath2 @xmath19- and @xmath2 @xmath20-errors , it can also correct @xmath2 @xmath15 and @xmath2 @xmath18 errors . for the ad channel",
    ", we only need to deal with the error @xmath15 but not with @xmath18 .",
    "for such a reason , requiring to be capable of correcting both @xmath19- and @xmath20-errors is a less efficient way for constructing quantum codes for the ad channel .",

    "following the lead of @xcite , other works concerning the error correction of amplitude damping errors have appeared into the literature @xcite . in @xcite , it is emphasized that the concept of self - complementarity is crucial for error correcting amplitude damping errors , although the sel - complementarity of the leung et _",

    "the recovery schemes employed are the so - called code projected and the optimal channel adapted recovery schemes .",
    "the latter scheme was computed via semidefinite programming methods in @xcite .",
    "however , no explicit analytical investigation ( similar , for instance , to the investigations presented in @xcite and @xcite  for depolarizing and weyl unitary errors , respectively ) is available .",

( [ cp - recovery ] ) for the code - projected recovery is the analytical counterpart of the numerical finding presented in @xcite ; finally , eq .
