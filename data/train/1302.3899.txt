    "the beltrami equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is lebesgue measurable in @xmath2 , is an elliptic ( uniformly elliptic if @xmath3 ) partial differential equation whose homeomorphic solutions are the quasiconformal maps ( finite distortion maps if @xmath4 ) of the plane .",
    "the quasiconformal maps enjoy a variety of important properties ( see the recent book @xcite for a modern treatment from the point of view of pde theory or the classic treatise @xcite ) and are often a useful tool for situations where conformal maps turn out to be too rigid .",
    "they are , however , not a perfect stand - in .",
    "they fail to be locally bi - lipschitz , for example , and this is the topic of our note .",
    "a necessary and sufficent condition for a quasiconformal map to be bi - lipschitz is unknown .",
    "perhaps the first step of understanding is due to j. schauder who showed that it is sufficient that @xmath1 be hlder continuous and compactly supported ( see chapter 15 of @xcite ) . in @xcite , j. mateu , j. orobitg , and j. verdera prove    let @xmath5 , @xmath6 , be a finite family of disjoint bounded domains of the plane with boundary of class @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are @xmath11-hlder continuous functions on @xmath12 and @xmath13 for each @xmath14 .",
    "then the principal solution associated to the @xmath1-beltrami equation ( i.e. the one which is @xmath15 near @xmath16 ) is a bi - lipschitz quasiconformal map .",
    "by @xmath11-hlder continuous on @xmath17 we mean that there exists a @xmath18 so that @xmath19 for all pairs @xmath20 .",
    "informally , theorem 1 extends the result of shauder to allow the dilatation to have jumps , provided that the jumps occur at reasonably smooth curves . in this note",
    "we give an alternate proof of this theorem using the more geometric methods of @xcite .",
    "in addition we will also show that our geometric methods extend theorem 1 to domains with ( properly defined ) corners if the dilatation takes certain allowable values ( which depend on the angle at the corner ) .",
    "the domains in theorem 1 may be taken to each have finitely many corners , provided the dilatation takes certain allowable values at each corner .",
    "we deliberately postpone the definition of both the allowable values of @xmath1 and the type of corners allowed until later , when they will hopefully appear natural to the reader .",
    "the novelty of this theorem is that even the most trivial examples of domains with corners prove to be quite complicated .",
    "for instance in @xcite , a. chritat considers the case of the beltrami equation which is a constant on the unit square and zero elsewhere .",
    "the computation of these maps and the image of the unit square under them are non - trivial .",
    "this is in direct contrast with the case of a beltrami equation supported on the unit disk , as discussed in sections 2.4 and 2.5 below .",
    "the structure of this note is as follows : in section 2 we outline some examples and tools which will be useful in our proofs , in section 3 we will give an alternate proof of the theorem of mateu , orobitg , and verdera , and in section 4 we extend this result to domains with corners .      part of this work was done while the second author was visiting the centre de recerca matemtica , and he would like to thank the crm for their support and their hospitality .",
    "he would also like to thank tadeusz iwaniec for stimulating discussions related to this work . while this research was done the first author",
    "was supported by the university of washington department of mathematics .",
    "in this section we describe some standard properties of conformal moduli which we will use in our proofs and discuss the role of both the koebe distortion theorem and the lehto integral condition in what follows .",
    "finally , we describe specific examples of bi - lipschitz quasiconformal maps which we will use in our proofs .",
    "the first example is rather simple , the second is more delicate .",
    "modulus is a conformal invariant for doubly connected domains in the plane . here",
    "we provide a brief overview of this invariant and discuss some of the properties which will be of use to us .",
    "suppose we have an annulus centered at 0 : @xmath21 .",
    "the positive quantity @xmath22 is called the _ modulus _ of @xmath23 . for other doubly connected domains @xmath24",
    ", there is a ( round ) annulus centered at zero which is the conformal image of @xmath24 .",
    "we define the _ modulus _ of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , to be the modulus of such an annulus .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath25 is well defined .",
    "this notion gives a simply stated geometric definition for quasiconformal maps , which can be shown ( see chapter i of @xcite ) to be equivalent to the other common definitions .    a _ k - quasiconformal map _",
    "@xmath26 is a sense - preserving homeomorphism of a domain @xmath27 with the property that all doubly connected @xmath24 with @xmath28 and their images , @xmath29 , satisfy @xmath30    the calculation of the modulus of an arbitrary doubly connected region is often difficult and the image of an annulus under a quasiconformal map may no longer be an annulus .",
    "we will get around this difficulty by showing here that if an annulus has modulus large enough , then its image under a global @xmath31-quasiconformal map is quantitatively `` almost round '' .",
    "let @xmath26 be a @xmath31-quasiconformal homeomorphism of @xmath2 .",
    "such global @xmath31-quasiconformal maps are _ quasisymmetric _ , meaning there exists an increasing homeomorphism @xmath32 such that for all @xmath33 , @xmath34 in fact , @xmath35 depends only on @xmath31 ( see chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "consider the annulus @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( this is the `` large enough '' condition ) .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 given by replacing @xmath42 with @xmath43 above , respectively . as @xmath38 , we have @xmath44 .",
    "let us define the annuli @xmath45 @xmath46 a sketch of such annuli around a doubly connected region representing @xmath47 is shown in figure [ fig : annuli ] .     and @xmath48 , clockwise from the upper left , around a single region @xmath47 ]    note that @xmath48 is the annulus of largest modulus centered at @xmath50 contained in @xmath47 and @xmath27 is the annulus of smallest modulus centered at @xmath50 which contains @xmath47 . using the definition of quasisymmetry , the monotonicity of the modulus with respect to inclusion , and the fact that @xmath51 is large we get the following chain of inequalities : @xmath52 @xmath53 of particular importance will be the difference between @xmath54 and @xmath55 :",
    "@xmath56 this will be especially useful in concert with the following theorem due to the second author in @xcite which provides a geometric criterion for quasiconformal bi - lipschitz maps .",
    "* theorem a. * _ let @xmath26 be a @xmath31-quasiconformal homeomorphism of @xmath2 and @xmath57 any set .",
    "assume that there is a constant @xmath58 such that the difference in conformal modulus of @xmath23 and @xmath47 is bounded by @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 holds for all annuli @xmath23 centered at points of @xmath48 with the property that both boundary circles meet @xmath48 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath26 to @xmath48 is bi - lipschitz .",
    "_    when we apply this result we will show this condition only for annuli with large modulus , as the definition of quasiconformal maps above already gives ( [ gbl ] ) for annuli with small modulus .",
    "the koebe distortion theorem ( see chapter 2 of @xcite ) is a powerful tool from conformal mapping theory .",
    "it implies that if @xmath60 is a compact set contained in a domain @xmath17 , then there is an @xmath61 , dependent on @xmath60 inside @xmath17 , such that for any conformal map @xmath26 of @xmath17 and any pair of points @xmath62 , @xmath63 hence the modulus of the derivative of @xmath26 at @xmath64 can not be far from the modulus of the derivative at @xmath65 , and from this we can see that conformal maps are locally bi - lipschitz . now consider two quasiconformal maps @xmath66 of a common domain @xmath17 with @xmath67 on @xmath17 .",
    "assume that @xmath68 is bi - lipschitz on a compact set @xmath69 .",
    "the composition formula for dilatations ( which we will use often in the sequel ) says that @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "thus @xmath72 is bi - lipschitz on @xmath73 since it is conformal , and @xmath74 is bi - lipschitz on @xmath60 as the composition of two bi - lipschitz maps .",
    "so maps with identical dilatation on a domain share the local bi - lipschitz property .",
    "this will allow us to compare known bi - lipschitz solutions to the beltrami equation with arbitrary solutions .",
    "another important tool for us will be an integral inequality originally discovered by o. lehto in @xcite but is perhaps more easily found in chapter v of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 be a @xmath31-quasiconformal map on some domain containing the annulus @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 be the complex dilatation of @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath77 where @xmath78 here stands for 2-dimensional lebesgue measure . considering the criterion described in theorem a above , it is clear that ( [ lehto ] ) may prove to be a useful tool .",
    "in fact , the singularity of the integral in ( [ lehto ] ) already hints at the importance of hlder continuity of @xmath1 in what follows .      in order to apply the lehto inequality ( [ lehto ] ) for all annuli around a given point",
    ", one needs @xmath1 to vanish at that point in such a way to eliminate the singularity in the integral of ( [ lehto ] ) .",
    "this will be done through composing with known bi - lipschitz maps .",
    "we start with a simple known example where @xmath1 is compactly supported .",
    "let @xmath79 be given .",
    "consider the map @xmath80 this map is a homeomorphism of the plane and it can easily be seen to be bi - lipschitz .",
    "note that the image of the unit circle is an ellipse and the map is conformal outside the unit disk .",
    "it is also the unique solution to the beltrami equation with dilatation @xmath81 and @xmath82 , often called the principal solution .",
    "while the solution to the constant dilatation beltrami equation supported on the disk is always bi - lipschitz , and this is also true of the half - plane , this is radically not true of sectors of angle @xmath83 .",
    "we show this by constructing such a map .    choosing the pricipal branch of the logarithm and @xmath84 , we let @xmath85 we wish to find a solution to the beltrami equation where @xmath1 is given by @xmath86 we start by setting @xmath87 this conveniently gives @xmath88 for real numbers @xmath89 and @xmath90 in @xmath91 . to extend @xmath92 continuously to the second sector we examine @xmath93 let @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "now we set @xmath98 this @xmath92 would be our solution , but the values may not match up on the two sides of the positive real axis .",
    "our solution to this will be to slice open the plane via a logarithm , then apply a rotation and dilation to get these two parts to match up continuously , and then we sew the plane back together with an exponential .",
    "using the principal branch of the logarithm we consider the image of the two sides of @xmath99 : @xmath100 in order to line up these two sides of the positive real line , we multiply by @xmath101 and our beltrami solution is @xmath102 so that the image of the sector @xmath103 is a logarithmic spiral . see figure [ fig : test2 ] for a visual description of this map .    ]",
    "this map will be bi - lipschitz if and only @xmath104 .",
    "as @xmath105 depends on @xmath106 and @xmath107 , it follows that when an angle for the sector is fixed , only certain values for the dilatation in that sector give rise to bi - lipschitz maps .    as maps with identical dilatation on a domain",
    "are simultaneously locally bi - lipschitz by the discussion in section 2.2 , any description of sufficient conditions for a quasiconformal map to be bi - lipschitz must take the rigidity of this example into account .    given an angle @xmath108 , we say that @xmath79 is _",
    "allowable for @xmath103 _ if @xmath109 .",
    "the reader interested in dilatation supported on the unit square would find the well - illustrated note @xcite interesting .",
    "our proof of theorem 1 begins with the simplifying assumption that @xmath110 ( see section 7 of @xcite for the standard details ) .",
    "let @xmath17 be a bounded domain in @xmath2 with @xmath111 a @xmath112 curve and @xmath1 be @xmath11-hlder continuous in @xmath17 and @xmath113 in @xmath114 .",
