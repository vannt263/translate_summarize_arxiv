    "long spin relaxation times are desirable for the operation of spintronic devices . in confined systems like quantum dots with a discrete level spectrum",
    "an initial electron spin polarization will not decay exponentially , unless the spins are coupled to extra degrees of freedom like phonons or nuclear spins .",
    "@xcite for larger or open systems , where the energy spectrum can be considered continuous , exponential decay is possible by purely elastic scattering which is then the dominant process at low enough temperatures .    in this article",
    "we reconsider spin - relaxation in a two - dimensional electron gas confined to a narrow channel , concentrating on elastic scattering processes .",
    "our study has been motivated by a recent experiment , where the size dependence of the spin relaxation time of an @xmath0-ingaas wire has been measured via faraday rotation spectroscopy.@xcite the size dependence sets in when the wire width is of the order of several bulk spin relaxation lengths .",
    "the observed behavior is non - monotonic with an initial increase followed by a sharp decrease at the smallest wire widths .",
    "the maximum spin relaxation time occurs when the width is of the order of the bulk spin relaxation length .",
    "remarkably , while the tendency to suppress spin - relaxation in confined systems has been predicted in a number of theoretical works , @xcite there has been no anticipation of the increase of the spin relaxation observed at the smallest widths . in this article",
    "we show that spin active boundaries , not considered in the previous theoretical analysis , dramatically change the size dependence of the spin relaxation time in the small width limit and provide a useful point of view as far as the interpretation of the experiment is concerned .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recall the method of quasiclassical green functions and point out when a diffusion equation approach is possible . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the spin dynamics in the bulk , whereas in sec .",
    "iv we turn to spin relaxation in finite systems .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional electron gas @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the internal magnetic field due to the spin - orbit coupling , @xmath3 is the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath4 is a delta - correlated random potential due to impurity scattering . for the internal field",
    "we concentrate on the rashba model , @xmath5 , where the spin - orbit field arises due to a structural inversion asymmetry .",
    "however , our treatment can be applied also to the case of bulk inversion asymmetry , where there is in addition the dresselhaus term@xcite which contributes to the two - dimensional effective hamiltonian with @xmath6 , or to the case of a two - dimensional hole gas , where the rashba spin - orbit field has a cubic dependence on momentum .",
    "@xcite    to study the spin dynamics we rely on the method of the quasiclassical green function .",
    "@xcite the latter solves the eilenberger equation ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 =   - \\frac{1}{\\tau } \\left ( g - \\langle g \\rangle \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the elastic scattering time , arising by the adoption of the standard self - consistent born approximation for elastic impurity scattering .",
    "@xmath10 is the fermi velocity and @xmath11 denotes the angular average over the fermi surface .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is valid in the limit when both the spin - orbit energy and @xmath12 are small compared to the fermi energy .",
    "@xcite besides the space and time dependence implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the quasiclassical green function @xmath13 is a matrix in spin space and is a function of energy @xmath14 ( measured with respect to the fermi surface ) and direction on the fermi surface , @xmath15 . @xcite in the absence of external potentials and magnetic fields the particle and spin density are obtained by summing over energy , angle and spin @xmath16    when the spin - orbit energy is small compared to the scattering rate the spin - dynamics becomes diffusive in the low frequency , long wavelength limit . in this limit",
    ", all the harmonics characterizing the angle dependence of @xmath17 can be expressed conveniently in terms of the @xmath18-wave component . as a result",
    "the problem simplifies considerably and one obtains , for the angle averaged green function , @xmath19 , a diffusion equation , which , in the presence of a general spin - orbit field , acquires the form given , for instance , in ref .  .",
    "for the rashba hamiltonian in particular the equations read @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] , and @xmath23 . since here we focus on the spin dynamics , we limit ourselves to terms to leading order in the parameter @xmath24 , therefore neglecting spin - charge coupling @xcite .",
    "the spin - dynamics is particularly simple for a spatially homogeneous spin density . from the diffusion equation one",
    "observes that the different spin directions decouple and the spin polarization along the @xmath25 or @xmath26 axis relaxes with the time constant @xmath27 or @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this type of spin relaxation , known as the dyakonov - perel mechanism , @xcite is easily understood : the electron spin precesses around the internal field @xmath29 .",
    "scattering from an impurity changes the direction of the internal field , and thus randomizes the spin precession .",
    "if the precession angle , @xmath30 , between collisions is small , the spin dynamics resembles a diffusion .",
    "the total precession angle after @xmath31 scattering events is of the order @xmath32 , from which the spin relaxation rate is estimated of the order @xmath33 .",
    "in general we can not rely on the diffusion equation but have to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . in the spatially homogeneous case",
    "the task simplifies , since again different spin directions do not couple . as a result",

    "apparently the full description of the spin dynamics now requires three time constants for each component .",
    "the slowest decaying component goes as @xmath37 with @xmath38 i.e.  for a clean system all components decay on the time scale of the scattering time @xmath9 .    for conventional diffusion",
    "the mode with the longest lifetime is homogeneous in space .",
    "here we encounter a different situation , due to the coupling of the various spin components . from the diffusion equation , for instance , the modes with the longest lifetime are found to form an elliptically modulated spin spiral , @xmath39 \\exp(- \\gamma_0 t ) , \\ ] ] where the vector @xmath40 lives in the @xmath41-@xmath42-plane with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "these long - living modes have been investigated in [ ] and in [ ] .",
    "for finite systems the equations have to be supplemented by boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite for specular scattering where an in - going trajectory is scattered into one outgoing direction the boundary condition for the eilenberger equation reads @xcite @xmath46 the unitary matrix @xmath47 describes the surface scattering . by decomposing the green function in charge and spin components , @xmath48 ,",
    "the boundary condition is equivalently expressed as @xmath49 with an orthogonal matrix @xmath50 that rotates the spin at the surface .",
    "charge conservation implies that no current flows through the boundary , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a vector normal to the boundary . for a spin conserving boundary ( @xmath53 ) also all components @xmath54 of the spin current perpendicular to the surface are zero , @xmath55 for the general case , @xmath56 , eq .

    "is not valid .    in the following we consider two types of boundary conditions .",
    "first we consider a spin - conserving boundary , where @xmath57 such that @xmath47 and @xmath50 are unit matrices . as a second example we will consider a boundary that scatters adiabatically , i.e. ,  an incoming wave in an eigenstate @xmath58 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] )  not including disorder  is scattered into the same band , @xmath59 as it is expected for a smooth confining potential .",
    "@xcite since the eigenstates in the presence of the field @xmath29 are spin - polarized parallel to @xmath29 , the adiabatic boundary implies a rotation of the spin polarization , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the angle between the electron momentum and the normal of the interface . before presenting our numerical results for the spin relaxation obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , it is useful to derive the boundary conditions in the diffusive regime . the idea is to solve the eilenberger equation near the boundary assuming that the angular average of @xmath17 varies only slowly on the scale of the mean free path , @xmath62 .",
    "this is justified when the spin relaxation length @xmath63 is much longer than @xmath62 . for directions pointing into the boundary one",
    "can then use the expansion valid in the bulk , @xmath64 combining ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) yields a relation that connects linearly the three spin components of the angular averaged green function , @xmath65 , and its spatial derivatives .",
