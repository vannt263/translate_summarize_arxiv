    "random pure states play a prominent role in quantum information processing .",
    "random states are defined with respect to the unitarily invariant ( so - called fubini - study ) measure on the space of unit vectors in the hilbert space of the system @xcite .",
    "not only do random states possess the remarkable feature of saturating the classical communication capacity of a noisy quantum channel @xcite , they also are an enabling resource for protocols including superdense coding of quantum states @xcite , approximate quantum encryption , and quantum data hiding @xcite .",
    "random quantum states can also be used for unbiased sampling , and the characterization of both ` typical ' bipartite and multipartite entanglement in random states has long been the focus of extensive investigation @xcite , recent results including estimates of moments of the subsystem purity distribution @xcite , relationships to state localization properties @xcite , and exact expressions for the probability distribution of entanglement measures such as @xmath2-concurrence @xcite and purity @xcite .",
    "how does one generate random quantum states ?",
    "one way is to apply a random unitary transformation to initial computational basis states .",
    "similar to random states , random unitary operators are drawn uniformly from the unique unitarily invariant measure  the haar measure on the unitary group u(@xmath3 ) , where @xmath3 denotes the hilbert space dimension , @xmath4 for a multipartite @xmath5-qubit system @xcite .",
    "random unitaries themselves are useful for a number of quantum protocols ranging from remote state preparation @xcite to efficient error characterization @xcite and selective process tomography @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", implementing random unitaries as a sequence of one- and two - qubit gates on a quantum computer is inefficient : the required number of quantum gates grows quadratically with @xmath3 , that is , exponentially with the number of qubits , @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , researchers are left with the challenge of constructing suitable pseudo - random ( pr ) substitutes .    a promising approach to efficiently implement an ensemble of unitaries so that the resulting moments approximate those induced by the haar measure is provided by _",
    "pr circuits _ , introduced in ref . .",
    "these circuits consist of an iterated set of single- and two - qubit gates where certain specifications are chosen at random .",
    "as the set of gates is iterated ( using different single - qubit gates for each qubit and at each time step ) , the statistical properties of the implemented unitary operators and the resulting output states compare more and more favorably to the properties of random unitaries and states .",
    "additional studies of pr circuits have focused on analyzing both analytically and numerically the convergence to the desired distribution @xcite , identifying optimal two - qubit gates , as well as elucidating some aspects related to the influence of qubit topology @xcite , and quantifying the ability to efficiently generate states with generic entanglement @xcite .",
    "pr algorithms have also been formulated for cluster - state quantum computation ( qc ) in ref .",
    ", allowing an optimal single - gate distribution to be identified",
    ". a yet different realization via local measurements on weighted graph states has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to quantitatively investigate a number of parameters that affect the convergence of pr circuits to the haar distribution . after providing the necessary background on the mathematical framework employed to characterize pr behavior in sec .",
    "ii , we proceed in sec .",
    "iii to assess the influence of three main design parameters in a pr circuit on a fixed number of qubits : the choice of single- and two - qubit gate distributions ; the influence of different qubit topologies ; and the effect of probabilistic versus deterministic two - qubit gate application .",
    "not surprisingly , these parameters are intertwined , causing the optimal choice for any one parameter to depend on one or several other parameters in complex ways .",
    "the influence of circuit size is addressed in sec .",
    "iv . remarkably , explicit scaling predictions turn out to be possible based on simple analytical expressions which are consistent with existing numerical evidence and analytical results .",
    "secs . v and vi",
    "are devoted to analyze the effect of limited ( non - selective ) control and of different initial states , respectively . in sec .",
    "vii we make some final remarks and conclude .",
    "additional considerations on optimizing cluster - state pr circuits are included in appendix a , whereas appendix b includes a proposed convergence improvement in the specific yet important case of a pr circuit implementing an approximate clifford twirl .",
    "we begin by discussing possible ways of quantifying the distance between the ensemble generated by pr circuits and the haar - distributed ensemble .",
    "it is important to realize that any probability distribution over @xmath5-qubit quantum states or unitary transformations requires a number of parameters exponentially growing with @xmath5 to specify .",
    "therefore , it is impractical to gauge how well an ensemble of quantum states or unitary transformations resembles the uniform haar ensemble based on a full characterization of the distribution .      for several tasks which utilize random states and unitary transformations , the details of the full distribution",
    "are not relevant , in the sense that only statistical moments up to a _ finite _ order of the ensemble from which the random states or unitaries are drawn need to coincide with haar - induced moments .",
    "that is , it suffices that the relevant probability distribution be indistinguishable from the uniform haar distribution as long as a finite number of moments is given .",
    "this is captured by the concept of a _ quantum @xmath0-design _ @xcite .",
    "formally , an ensemble of states , @xmath6,@xmath7 $ ] , ( or , respectively , unitary transformations , @xmath8 $ ] ) is a state ( unitary ) @xmath0-design if for any polynomial @xmath9 of order ( @xmath0,@xmath0 ) of the state - vector components ( or matrix elements ) , @xmath10 or , @xmath11 where the integrals are taken with respect to the invariant ( fubini - study or haar ) measure , respectively .",
    "a ( @xmath0,@xmath0 ) polynomial refers to a linear combination of terms consisting of products of up to @xmath0 variables and their @xmath0 complex conjugates .    in order to assess",
    "how well a pr circuit approximates a @xmath0-design , an appropriate norm must be defined on the space of ( @xmath0,@xmath0 ) polynomials describing moments of the pseudo random circuit .",
    "we note that the concept of an @xmath12-approximate @xmath0-design for quantum states was introduced in @xcite as an ensemble of states @xmath6 , @xmath7 $ ] satisfying @xmath13 for all ( @xmath0,@xmath0 ) polynomials @xmath9 .",
    "this notion induces a norm on the space of all ( @xmath0,@xmath0 ) polynomials ( specifically the @xmath14-norm ) , which can quantify the distance of a distribution approximating an exact @xmath0-design . in our study",
    ", we shall focus on asymptotic convergence _ rates _ of arbitrary ( 2,2 ) polynomials to their expected value under the haar measure as a function of pr circuit depth .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite has previously shown that a large class of pr circuits are efficient approximate unitary @xmath1-designs , with respect to the diamond norm .      the case @xmath15 is especially relevant , since it includes the majority of known protocols which utilize random states .",
    "notable examples include unbiased noise estimation @xcite , and the generation of states with typical entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to determine the behavior of @xmath16 polynomials ( second moments ) of the state components under the action of pr circuits .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the evolution of the second moments can be mapped to an appropriately defined classical markov chain .",
    "thus , convergence properties of the pr circuit to a @xmath1-design may be directly established by exploiting properties of the corresponding markov chain .    to obtain the mapping ,",
    "the density operator describing the pure quantum state being evolved by the pr circuit is written in the pauli basis : @xmath17 is a tensor - product string of single - qubit identity and pauli operators , specified by the collective index @xmath18 .",
    "let pr@xmath19 be the family of pr circuits of depth @xmath20",
    ". we shall be interested in the evolution of the second order moments , @xmath21 , as a function of the depth , @xmath20 , of the pr circuit .",
    "it will be shown by construction that the moments @xmath22 follow a discrete markov chain on @xmath23 .",
    "that is , the evolution of @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a markov matrix . for the random circuits examined here , the remaining second moments @xmath21 , with @xmath27 , vanish for @xmath28 .",
    "the class of pr circuits we are interested in have the following structure : in a single time step , local ( single - qubit ) gates are applied to each qubit in parallel , followed by commuting two - qubit gates belonging to the clifford group between a specified set of neighboring qubits .",
    "typically , the two - qubit gates will be conditional phase gates cz@xmath29 . under a single - qubit gate , each non - trivial pauli operator transforms as @xmath30 where @xmath31 so(3 ) depends on the applied rotation .",
    "the corresponding transformation matrix @xmath32 acting on the space of local pauli operators ( including the identity , @xmath33 ) is obtained by averaging the squared coefficients over the parameters specifying the desired distribution of rotations .",
    "we examine only those local gate distributions that satisfy @xmath34 this condition ensures that @xmath35 is indeed a markov matrix . assuming that each local gate is _ selected independently _ from the same distribution ( see sec .",
    "v for a different setting ) , the transformation resulting from simultaneous single - qubit rotations within a pr iteration is the @xmath5-fold tensor product of these single - qubit transformations , @xmath36 since each two - qubit gate is a member of the clifford group , it simply acts ( up to irrelevant phases ) as a permutation on the columns of @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the full @xmath38-dimensional transformation is a markov matrix provided that @xmath32 is .",
    "once the mapping is established , basic properties of markov chains may be used to analyze the evolution of the second moments of the pr circuit . specifically , if the markov chain is _ ergodic _ , then the corresponding pr circuit converges to a @xmath1-design .",
    "a markov chain is ergodic if it is _ irreducible _ and _ aperiodic_. that is , every state must be reached from every other state and the recurrence times to any state must not be multiples of some period @xmath39 .",
    "a consequence of ergodicity is that for any initial distribution @xmath40 over @xmath23 , there exists a unique asymptotic distribution , @xmath41 , towards which the chain evolves . to illustrate this",
    ", we may expand the initial state in terms of the ( linearly independent ) eigenvectors @xmath42 of the markov matrix , @xmath43 .",
    "for an ergodic chain , there is only one eigenvalue equal to @xmath44 , whereas all other eigenvalues have magnitude less than 1 .",
    "thus , the contribution to @xmath45 from each eigenvector ( other than the ergodic eigenvector that is equal to 1 ) decays to zero exponentially at a rate governed by the corresponding eigenvalue . for times",
    "@xmath46 , the contribution from the sub - dominant eigenvalue , @xmath47 , will be the dominant non - ergodic contribution , leaving @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the spectral gap of the markov chain . since any ( 2,2 ) polynomial may be expressed in terms of the moments @xmath21 it follows that at sufficiently long times , @xmath50 , the difference between the expected value of any @xmath16 polynomial of the state vector components over the @xmath0-design distribution and the haar - induced expected value obeys @xmath51 as we shall see , certain entanglement measures which serve as useful test functions for pr circuits are expressible as @xmath16 polynomials and will thus converge exponentially to their haar - expected value at a rate of @xmath52 .",
    "a markov chain may be reduced by identifying a partition of the state space , @xmath53 , into subsets , @xmath54 , such that the coarse - grained probability distribution obtained by summing over each subset follows a reduced markov chain @xmath55 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for reducing the chain is that the sum of the transition probabilities from a member of a subset , @xmath56 , to all members of any subset , @xmath57 , is the same for each member @xmath58 , that is , @xmath59 must be the same for all @xmath60 and all subsets @xmath61 .",
    "it is important to note that each eigenvalue of @xmath55 is an eigenvalue of @xmath62 .",
    "we employ a reduced representation by averaging over local @xmath63 and @xmath64 pauli operators .",
    "since cz gates are invariant under rotations along the @xmath65-axis , we may restrict our choice of single - qubit gate distributions to those which initially randomize states in the @xmath66-@xmath67 plane .",
    "now let @xmath68 be a pauli string containing at least one @xmath69 or @xmath70 , and let @xmath71 be any string obtained from @xmath68 by permuting @xmath69 with @xmath70 . since @xmath62 randomizes @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath72 .",
    "this defines the kernel of @xmath62 , which may be removed by defining new variables @xmath73 .",
    "chain states including @xmath74 may be discarded , whereas transitions within @xmath75 are described by @xmath55 .",
    "there is now only one parameter left to characterize the local gate distribution .",
    "let @xmath76 $ ] parameterize the extent to which the @xmath65-axis is left invariant .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath77 as the _ local gate parameter _ henceforth .",
    "the single - qubit gate contribution to @xmath55 is then fully described by : @xmath78 haar - distributed rotations in su@xmath79 correspond to @xmath80 .",
    "so - called _ hz gates _ , single - qubit hadamard gates followed by a random rotation about the @xmath65-axis , correspond to @xmath81 .",
    "the latter were identified in @xcite as optimal single - qubit gates when using two - qubit cz gates .    in some instances , it is possible to further reduce the markov chain by taking into account qubit - permutation symmetries in the construction of pr circuits ( see sec .",
    "iv ) . the corresponding markov chain will admit a reduced chain by forming equivalence classes of pauli strings under symmetry operations .",
    "in the case of _ full permutation symmetry _ , equivalence classes may be labeled by the number of @xmath63 s and @xmath82 s in each pauli string .",
    "accordingly , the size of the reduced state space grows only quadratically in the number of qubits @xmath5 , allowing scaling behavior of markov matrix properties with circuit size to be determined numerically .",
    "note that while the reduced representation enabled by the initial randomization of @xmath66 and @xmath67 contains all of the non - zero eigenvalues of the full markov chain , reduced representations induced by qubit permutations discard eigenvalues associated with asymmetry with respect to the permutations .",
    "thus , the behavior of test functions which do not possess the symmetry can not be predicted if the initial state does not also share the symmetry which permits the reduction .",
    "as remarked , entanglement properties of random pure states have been extensively studied . in particular ,",
    "bipartite - entanglement across a partition is known to be nearly maximal for random states . as observed in @xcite , linear entropy , a measure of bipartite entanglement ,",
    "may be expressed as a @xmath16 polynomial in the state components , allowing the rate at which bipartite entanglement approaches its expected haar - value to be determined by markov analysis . both features  that the asymptotic value of the entanglement is nearly maximal , and that the simplest measure of the entanglement is a @xmath16 polynomial in the state vector components",
    " are not limited to bipartite entanglement but also apply to a more general class of entanglement properties that are captured by the _ generalized entanglement _",
    "( ge ) approach @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of ge is to abstract the notion of entanglement from a preferred subsystem decomposition and instead tie it to a distinguished set of observables to which one has access ( in an appropriately defined sense ) . intuitively speaking",
    ", a pure quantum state @xmath83 is defined as ` generalized unentangled ' relative to a distinguished set of observables , @xmath84 , depending on whether or not the ` reduced state ' with respect to those observables is pure ( extremal ) , and generalized entangled otherwise .",
    "that is , if one can determine which pure state a system is in by only making reference to the expectation values of observables in @xmath84 , then the reduced state is pure . under appropriate mathematical assumptions on @xmath84 @xcite , the simplest way to quantify ge",
    "is by taking the square length of the projection of the full pure state @xmath85 onto @xmath84 , yielding the so - called @xmath84-purity .",
    "formally , the latter is defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a normalization constant and \\{@xmath88 } is an orthonormal ( with respect to the trace norm ) basis of @xmath84 .",
    "ge relative to @xmath84 may be naturally quantified as ge@xmath89 . a simple representative of this class of state functionals in the conventional multi - partite setting is the global entanglement measure of meyer and wallach @xcite : @xmath90,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the reduced density matrix of qubit @xmath92 .",
    "the expectation of @xmath93 over random pure states is @xcite : @xmath94 the difference between the average entanglement of pr algorithm output states and random state entanglement , @xmath95 , provides a distance indicator between pr and random states whose asymptotic behavior should be predicted by the markov matrix analysis .",
    "the average meyer - wallach entanglement has been examined in previous studies of pr circuits @xcite , further motivating its consideration in the present context .",
    "the other method we use to assess the quality of our pr circuits is based on the distribution of state vector probability in the computational basis .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the @xmath97th component of the @xmath98th state randomly chosen from the set of all pure states , with @xmath99 being the corresponding probability .",
    "the distribution of @xmath100 for random states is given by the porter - thomas ( pt ) distribution @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath3 is the hilbert space dimension .",
    "in the limit @xmath102 , and upon rescaling to unit mean , the distribution becomes @xmath103 as our second randomness indicator , we shall examine the @xmath104-distance ( simply denoted by @xmath105 henceforth ) between the distribution of output probabilities at each pr iteration and the random ( porter - thomas ) distribution .",
    "note that because this test function depends on higher order moments of the pr - distribution , it is not _ a priori _ described by the above - described markov chain analysis and thus can yield additional insight .",
    "any universal set of gates used in a pr circuit will eventually generate haar - distributed states and operators @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to explore how various design parameters affect pr circuits , in an effort to boost efficiency by optimizing time and qubit resources . by focusing on the network model of qc",
    ", we first characterize the optimal choice of single- and two - qubit gates for an open - chain topology as considered in the ` standard ' pr architecture of ref . .",
    "the effect of different qubit topologies and probabilistic gate application is addressed next , whereas , for clarity , a similar analysis for cluster - state qc is sketched in appendix a.      pr circuits were introduced in the context of liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processing . in that context",
    "it was natural to look at an open chain of qubits and to use two - qubit ising ( zz ) gates between nearest neighbor ( nn ) qubits , @xmath106,\\ ] ] as the relevant non - local resource .",
    "subsequently , other two - qubit gates have been suggested for use within pr algorithms @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study was recently undertaken @xcite to determine the two - qubit gate for which a pr circuit with random single - qubit gates will converge most quickly to the haar expected value of bipartite entanglement as quantified by linear entropy .",
    "recall that this is essentially equivalent to determining convergence rates of second order moments of the pr circuit .",
    "the protocol studied calls for a single two - qubit gate to be applied per time interval to pairs of qubits which are selected at random from all allowable neighboring pairs according to either a closed or open chain @xcite .",
    "it was determined that the so - called _ xy gate _ is the two - qubit gate which leads to the most efficient pr circuit of this type .",
    "the xy gate between qubits @xmath92 and @xmath97 is given by @xmath107.\\ ] ] however , the use of only a single two - qubit gate per time interval introduces an unnecessary inefficiency since qubits not involved in the gate do nothing for that time interval and , in any experimental implementation , must be protected from error .",
    "we wish to examine to what extent the number of applied gates can be traded for the number of time steps by applying gates in parallel",
    ". one can not apply all nn xy gates during one time interval since they do not commute .",
    "nevertheless , a more efficient pr circuit using xy gates can be obtained if , at each time interval , half the nn xy gates are applied .",
    "[ zzchain ] compares the state vector element distribution distance and average entanglement distance as a function of iteration for a pr algorithm which uses conditional phase ( cz ) gates ( which are zz gates to within single - qubit @xmath65-rotations ) between all nn qubits , and a pr algorithm which uses xy gates between half the nn pairs at each iteration ( say , 1 - 2 , 3 - 4 , etc .  at odd iterations and 2 - 3 , 4 - 5",
    ", etc .  at even iterations ) . in both cases ,",
    "the single - qubit rotations are drawn randomly from su@xmath79 .",

    "when using random single - qubit gates , both indicators come within @xmath108 much more quickly for xy two - qubit gates than for cz gates . modifying the cz - based algorithm to use single - qubit hz gates boosts the convergence rate so much that it even outperforms the xy - based algorithm with random single - qubit rotations.,width=302 ]    in all work mentioned above , it was assumed that single - qubit rotations should be random with respect to the haar measure on su@xmath79 . based on studies of cluster - state pr algorithms ,",
    "however , we have recently shown @xcite that when using two - qubit cz gates a _ restricted set of single - qubit rotations _ , hz gates , allows for faster convergence with respect to test functions which are second - order polynomials .",

    "the closed - chain topology is ergodic and the pr circuit will induce exponential convergence to the corresponding ergodic state , with a rate calculated from the gap of the markov matrix .",

    "figure [ ei ] shows the difference in state element distribution and average entanglement between random states and states produced from the pr circuit with different @xmath247 initial states as a function of iteration . we have used a pr algorithm with an open - chain topology , cz gates , and random single - qubit rotations .",
    "all states approach the random state entanglement at the same exponential rate .",
    "not too surprisingly , however , initial states with entanglement closer to that of random states approach random state entanglement faster than other states . for @xmath114 , the entanglement of the state @xmath249 equals that of random states , and has the fastest convergence to random entanglement ( that the state with entanglement equal to that of random states converges the fastest",

    "the cluster - state approach to qc , however , may be less stringent on the number of necessary elements .",

    "qubits are represented by circles and pairs of qubits that have been entangled via a cz gate are connected by a line .",
    "a cluster state with qubits arranged in a two - dimensional lattice such that each qubit has been entangled with four nns , suffices for universal qc @xcite . for photonic realizations of cluster - state",
    "qc , where two qubit gates can only be applied probabilistically , one assumes an unlimited number of maximally entangled epr pairs ( attained for example via spontaneous parametric down - conversion ) which can be used to construct larger cluster states using so - called fusion operations @xcite .",
    "once the desired cluster state has been constructed , any qc algorithm can be implemented using only single - qubit measurements in the @xmath66-@xmath67 plane .",
    "the inherent entanglement in the cluster state means that measurement on one qubit may effect the state of the remaining qubits .",
    "thus , one can view each row of the cluster - state lattice as the evolution of a single - qubit in time .",
    "connections between rows are used for two - qubit gates .",

    "two - qubit gates are performed via a connection between two rows of the cluster state .",
    "cz gates in particular are ` built - in ' to the cluster state and simple measurement automatically implements the gate .",
    "pr state generation via the cluster state model of qc was first explored in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm was initially performed using three qubits in a chain to implement random rotations , @xmath80 , and a connection between rows of the cluster state on every third qubit implemented the cz gates . in this way , @xmath20 iterations of an @xmath5-qubit pr circuit required a lattice of @xmath264 qubits ( where the extra @xmath44 comes from the final , unmeasured column ) .",
    "however , by ` filling in ' the extra vertical connections , thus making the single - qubit rotations hz gates with @xmath81 , such that all qubits were connected to their four nns , the convergence rate of the pr algorithm increased .",
    "we explore cluster state topologies where the ` columns ' of the two - dimensional lattice are connected as circles ( making the cluster state a cylinder ) , where all qubits in a ` column ' are connected to each other ( aa ) and where each qubit is attached only to one central qubit ( stars ) .",
    "we note that both the aa shape and the star shape are graph representations of generalized ghz states differing only by single - qubit rotations @xcite . within the star topology , we look at two different measurement strategies  measuring the central qubit first , and measuring the central qubit last .",

    "the cylindrical lattice converges most quickly .",
    "the ghz - type topologies ( star and aa ) converge more slowly and are , in this way , like the aa topologies of circuit - model pr algorithms using two - qubit cz and one - qubit hz gates .",
    "the open and closed chain exhibit cutoff behavior in the entanglement convergence , as noted in @xcite .",
    "[ clustertop],width=302 ]    figure [ clustertop ] shows that the ghz - type states converge more slowly than the two - dimensional lattice and cylindrical topologies with the cylindrical topology converging fastest .",
    "this is similar to the circuit model for pr algorithms employing two qubit cz gates and one qubit hz gates where the aa topology converges the slowest .",
    "photonic implementations of cluster state qc require construction of the appropriate cluster state using operations that work probabilistically .",
    "thus , any cluster state has an associated cost in the amount of resources required to , on average , build the given state .",
    "much work has gone into finding algorithms that will lower the cost of construction for cluster states of two - dimensions , i.e.  in which each qubit has 4 nns @xcite . in these works",
    ", cost is generally associated with the number of epr pairs needed for state construction .",
    "one conclusion that emerges from this work is that the cost of constructing one dimensional chains is relatively low and it is joining these chains ( such that cz gates can be applied ) which is the majority of the cost . for this analysis",
    "we assume that these connections can be attempted without breaking the chain ( even if the operation is not successful ) .",
    "we have already noted that a full two - dimensional cluster state ( with every vertical connection filled in ) is optimal for pr cluster - circuits .",
    "however , what if we were to apply the cluster cz gates only probabilistically ?",
    "while we know from our exploration of circuit model pr algorithms using an open chain topology that the number of necessary iterations would increase , a probabilistic application of these gates would cut the construction cost of the initial cluster state .",
    "let us assume that an attempt to link two cluster chains together succeeds with probability @xmath265 .",
    "we also assume the availability of infinitely long cluster chains .",
    "as an example let @xmath266 and we attempt to construct a cluster state which can implement @xmath267 iterations of the cluster pr circuit in which the two qubit gates are implemented with probability @xmath135 . on average",
    ", construction of such a cluster state would require @xmath268 probabilistic operations , where @xmath5 is the number of rows ( logical qubits ) in the cluster lattice .",
    "thus , for an 8-qubit cluster pr algorithm , to construct a cluster capable of implementing a pr circuit with a convergence rate of .547 ( which is at @xmath269 as shown in fig .  [ oc8 ] ) requires on average @xmath270 probabilistic operations ( recall that the circuit pr algorithm with hz gates is equivalent to the cluster - state pr algorithm ) .",
    "a pr circuit with half that convergence rate , would require @xmath271 iterations but could use an algorithm with @xmath272 .",
    "this would require on average @xmath273 attempts .",
    "thus , for this case , it is better to construct a cluster state capable of higher @xmath135 value pr circuits .",
    "however , further analysis is necessary in the more realistic case where all resources are accurately counted ( including losses taken upon failure of fusion operations ) , for different topologies , and for other values of @xmath135 and @xmath265 .",
    "clifford twirls @xcite , or 2-designs , play an important role in a number of quantum information protocols .",
    "a construction for an approximate clifford twirl has recently been suggested in @xcite . the procedure detailed in @xcite consists of a sequence of twirling operations .",
    "a twirl consists of i ) performing one operation out of a specified set of operations ; ii ) allowing the super - operator , @xmath274 , to occur ; iii ) undoing the original operation .",
    "the net effect of the twirl is to convert @xmath274 into a new super - operator @xmath275 . in the case of a clifford twirl ,",
    "in which the set of operations is the clifford group , any super - operator is converted into a depolarizing channel .",
    "the effect of the sequence of twirling operators on the set of pauli strings can be represented as a markov matrix , identical to those that describe the decay of the second moments of a pr circuit .",
    "thus , a one - to one mapping exists between pr circuit constructions and approximate twirling operations .",
    "when the procedure in @xcite is considered as a pr circuit , it bears a close resemblance to pr circuits in a star topology , with probabilistic cz gates , and random local gates applied to the non - central qubits .",
    "however , the procedure of @xcite involves three time steps each of which is counted as an application of simultaneous probabilistic cz gates .",
    "an approximate calculation of the convergence rate is made in @xcite in order to determine scaling properties .",
    "we find that an exact calculation of the gap of the corresponding markov matrix gives @xmath276 , irrespective of the number of qubits .",
    "we can improve the convergence rate of this procedure marginally by using the following , simpler construction : perform a pr circuit with the star topology with @xmath168 for the central qubit , while keeping @xmath125 for the non - central qubits and a gate probability of @xmath277 .",
    "we find a gap of @xmath278 . since this must be applied three times to perform the same number of gates as in @xcite , this improved construction yields an effective gap of @xmath279 .",
