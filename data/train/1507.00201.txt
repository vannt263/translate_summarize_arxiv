    "when sound propagates from an emitter to a receiver in a natural environment , objects along its path ( _ e.g. _ , a human or robot head , walls ... ) lead to reflections and reverberation .",
    "this is commonly modeled as a linear filtering and described by the convolution of the emitted signal with a so called _ room impulse response _ ( rir ) . for a given room ,",
    "the latter only depends on the source s spatial properties ( position , orientation , directivity , diffuseness , etc . ) and not on the emitted signal .",
    "the frequency domain counterparts of rirs are _ acoustic transfer functions _",
    "knowledge of the atfs involved in an acoustic setup is useful in many audio signal processing applications , _",
    "e.g. _ , blind source separation @xcite , beamforming @xcite , sound source localization @xcite , acoustic echo cancellation @xcite .",
    "most existing methods to estimate atfs rely on the synchronized emitted and received signals . however , the emitted signals are often not available , rendering the estimation of atfs impossible without additional restrictive assumptions .",
    "for this reason , _ relative transfer functions _ are often considered @xcite .",
    "these also capture source spatial properties and do not depend on the emitted signal , with the advantage that they can be reliably and robustly estimated directly from an observed multichannel signal @xcite .",
    "they are defined as a _",
    "normalized _ version of atfs , _",
    "i.e. _ , the atf at a given microphone is divided by a linear combination of the atfs to other microphones , _",
    "e.g. _ , the atf of a reference microphone . in the case of @xmath0 microphones ,",
    "the log - magnitude and phase of rtfs are referred to as _ interaural level _ and _ phase differences _ , respectively , in the binaural hearing literature @xcite .",
    "recently , supervised sound source localization methods making use of a training set of interaural cues @xcite or of rtfs @xcite have been proposed .    in this paper ,",
    "we theoretically investigate the possibility of generalizing rtfs to more than one source .",
    "such generalizations should preserve the three key properties of rtfs , namely , they can be directly estimated from observed signals , they capture spatial properties of the sources and they do not depend on the emitted signals .",
    "we first state and prove a theorem showing that such a generalization is not possible if a single multichannel spectro - temporal observation is used .",
    "we then consider the case of multiple time observations , and propose a new transformation for multichannel , multi - frame spectrograms , _",
    "i.e. _ , containing several multichannel time frames in each time - frequency bin .",
    "this transformation builds on the plcker embedding method for grassmannian manifolds .",
    "we show that it yields a natural generalization of rtfs to multiple sources , when there are less sources than microphones . through simulated experiments ,",
    "we show how this method could be applied to the localization of multiple simultaneously active sound sources using short spectro - temporal windows , without having to separate them .",
    "let us consider a sound source emitting the spectrogram @xmath1 recorded by an @xmath2-microphone array , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the number of frequency bands and the number of time frames , respectively . under noise - free , finite convolutive filtering assumptions and for long enough time frames , the multichannel observation @xmath5\\tp\\in\\mathbb{c}^m$ ] received by @xmath2 microphones at frequency - time",
    "@xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8\\in\\mathbb{c}^m$ ] comprises the acoustic transfer functions from the source to the @xmath2 microphones at frequency @xmath9 .",
    "for a given microphone setup in a given room , @xmath10 solely depends on the source s _ spatial properties_. therefore , ( [ eq:1source_model ] ) nicely decomposes the recorded signal into a component @xmath10 that only captures spatial properties and a component @xmath11 that only captures the source content at @xmath6 .",
    "if the emitted signal @xmath11 is unknown , unambiguously recovering @xmath10 from observation @xmath12 is impossible , without further assumptions .",
    "however , the specific structure of eq .  [ eq:1source_model ] offers an attractive way to circumvent this .",
    "let @xmath13 be a _ normalizing function _ , which divides an input vector by a linear combination of its entries , _",
    "e.g. _ , the first entry .",
    "it is then easy to check that @xmath14 for all @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the nonzero locus of the linear combination . in other words ,",
    "the signal term cancels out and @xmath17 , when defined , captures only the spatial properties of the source . in the signal processing literature , @xmath18 is referred to as a _ relative transfer function _ ( rtf ) @xcite . in summary",
    ", relative transfer functions possess three key desirable properties :    * _ ( i ) _ they can be directly estimated from observed signals * _ ( ii ) _ they capture spatial properties of the sound source * _ ( iii ) _ they do not depend on the emitted signal    mathematically , these three properties are verified if and only if there exists a _",

    "@xmath78 is called a _ grassmannian manifold _ :",
    "elements of this set are @xmath24-dimensional linear subspaces of @xmath51 @xcite . assuming that the square matrix @xmath79 has linearly independent columns ( this assumption is further discussed in section [ subsec : conditions ] ) , it acts as a change of basis from the column space of @xmath80 to the column space of @xmath81 in equation ( [ eq : ktsource_model ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 does not depend on @xmath79 , and @xmath83 possesses the desired properties to generalize rtfs .    however , the output values of @xmath83 are not vectors but vector subspaces .",
    "these can not be manipulated numerically .",
    "we thus need a way to map the grassmannian manifold @xmath78 to a numerical space .",
    "this is possible using a method known as _",

    "the method was first introduced in the case @xmath84 and @xmath85 by julius plcker in 1865 , and later generalized to any @xmath24 and @xmath2 values by hermann grassmann .",
    "building on this , we propose a new transform for multichannel , multi - frame spectrograms .",
    "this transform applied to equation ( [ eq : ktsource_model ] ) will yield an equation of the form ( [ eq:1source_model ] ) , allowing a generalization of rtfs to multiple sources .",
    "we shall name it the _ plcker spectrogram transform _ after the work of julius plcker .",
    "let @xmath71 be an @xmath2-channel @xmath24-frame spectrogram .",
    "we denote by @xmath86 the @xmath87 matrix formed by the @xmath24 rows of @xmath81 with indexes @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the lexicographically - ordered list of cardinal-@xmath24 sublists of @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "we define the _ plcker spectrogram transform of order @xmath24 _ as follows : @xmath92 this transform applied to ( [ eq : ktsource_model ] ) yields the following remarkable identity : @xmath93 this follows from the determinant property @xmath94 for square matrices @xmath50 and @xmath95 of equal sizes .",
    "interestingly , ( [ eq : identity ] ) has the same form as equation ( [ eq:1source_model ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the plcker spectrogram transform changes an @xmath2-microphone observation of @xmath24 sources into an @xmath96-microphone observation of a single ( compound ) source . as a consequence",
    ", we have : @xmath97 therefore , @xmath98 is a suitable generalization of rtfs to @xmath24 sources and @xmath2 microphones ( @xmath48 ) using multiframe spectrograms .",
    "namely , it verifies properties _ ( i ) _ , ( _ ii _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) , and for @xmath99 , the rtf definition given in section [ subsec:1source ] is exactly recovered .",
    "the proposed approach shares a lot of similarities with the so - called _ subspace methods _ for sound source localization .",
    "a well - known example is the method music , which stands for multiple signal classification , @xcite .",
    "music starts by computing the covariance matrix of a multichannel signal in a given frequency band .",
    "an eigenvalue decomposition of this matrix is then performed , allowing to identify the _ signal subspace _ , spanned by the principal eigenvectors , and the orthogonal _ noise subspace _ , spanned by the remaining eigenvectors .",
    "as showed in section [ subsec : multicase ] , the signal subspace corresponds to the space spanned by the atf , or equivalently the rtf vectors associated to the emitting sources , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath100 .",
    "in contrast , rtf vectors are orthogonal to the noise subspace",
    ". therefore , sound source directions are those whose associated rtf vectors have minimal projections onto the noise subspace .",
    "they are usually estimated by finding the smallest projections of a predefined set of rtf vectors .",
    "alternatively , in equation ( [ eq : grtf ] ) , we introduce a new vector @xmath98 which _ uniquely characterizes _ the signal subspace @xmath100 , using a minimal number of observations .",
    "this vector can thus be directly mapped to the spatial properties of all sources , provided that the associated mapping function is known .",
    "this mapping may either be directly obtained from a sound propagation model or learned from a predefined set of rtf vectors , as demonstrated in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "an intrinsic difference between this approach and music is that it does not require the estimation and decomposition of covariance matrices . on the other hand ,",
    "it requires a mapping from generalized rtfs to multiple - source spatial characteristics , while music only requires single - source mappings .      assuming that the normalizing function @xmath13 divides a vector by , _",
    "e.g. _ , its first entry , ( [ eq : grtf ] ) is only valid if @xmath101 . using ( [ eq : plucker ] ) , ( [ eq : identity ] ) and properties of the determinant , it follows that such singularity only occurs in the following situations :    * if one or more sources are completely silent in all @xmath24 time frames @xmath102 at frequency @xmath9 . * if two or more sources are perfectly correlated over the segment , _",
    "i.e. _ , their absolute normalized cross - correlation is 1 .",
    "* if two or more sources have _ similar _ spatial properties , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath103 for some @xmath104 . this may occur if , _ e.g. _ , they have identical directions in the free - field case . * if the @xmath24 transfer functions and emitted signals are such that observations are linearly dependent , by coincidence .",
    "let us define audio sources as objects emitting distinguishable sounds from distinguishable locations .",
    "then , the first three cases may be interpreted as a violation of the assumption that there are @xmath24 sources .",
    "the fourth case is harder to interpret , but it has a zero probability of occurrence assuming that distinguishable transfer functions and signals are mutually statistically independent . in other words ,",
    "the proposed generalization of rtf is sound if the assumed number of sources @xmath24 is correct .",
    "if the actual number of sources @xmath105 at @xmath6 is less than @xmath24 then @xmath106 . if @xmath107 , the desirable properties are no longer preserved . a straightforward way to determine",
    "@xmath105 is to note that : @xmath108 if @xmath109 , @xmath105 can thus be deduced by successively calculating @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "we test the potential of the proposed generalization of rtf for multiple sound - source localization ( ssl ) . in what follows ,",
    "spectrograms are computed on signals sampled at 8,000 khz using 32 ms sliding windows with 50% overlap .",
    "this results in @xmath112 positive frequencies and @xmath113 time frames per second of signal .",
    "we use a dataset of _ head - related transfer functions _ ( hrtfs ) for the humanoid robot nao .",
    "these hrtfs are simulated using a 3d model of the head in an anechoic environment and the boundary element method , as done in @xcite .",
    "corresponding impulse responses have a maximal length of @xmath114ms .",
    "the subset @xmath115 used contains @xmath116 hrtfs @xmath117 for the @xmath85 microphones placed on the head . here",
    "@xmath118 is a set of source directions with azimuth and elevations randomly picked in @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath120 $ ] respectively . from this dataset ,",

    "we then simulate all possible @xmath2-microphone mixtures of one to three white - noise sources coming from distinct directions in @xmath124 , by convolving random signals of one second duration with the hrtfs in @xmath115 .",
    "the minimum distance between distinct sources is @xmath125 in azimuth and @xmath126 in elevation .",
    "these mixtures are perturbed by additive gaussian noise with 10 db or 50 db _ signal - to - noise ratios _ ( snrs ) .",
    "the plcker spectrogram transform of order @xmath24 ( [ eq : plucker ] ) is then applied to all individual @xmath24-frame time segments of all these mixtures , where @xmath24 is the number of sources , assumed known .",
    "the @xmath3 grtfs associated with the @xmath3 frequency bins at each segment are concatenated and compared to those of the corresponding training set @xmath122 , in terms of euclidean distance .",
    "the set of @xmath24 directions minimizing this distance gives the estimated sound source directions .",
    "for @xmath99 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , this respectively corresponds to approximately @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 localization tasks using time segments of length 32ms , 48ms and 64ms .",
    "the mean computational times per source per second of signal where respectively 81ms , 87ms and 436ms using our matlab implementation on a conventional pc . mean absolute azimuth localization errors obtained with this procedure are summarized in table [ tab : results ] ( grtf ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results confirm that the proposed generalization of rtf captures spatial properties of sources under low noise level ( 50 db snr ) .",
    "however , performance is severely degraded for higher noise levels ( 10 db snr ) .",
    "while these results are only preliminary , they reveal two intrinsic benefits of the proposed approach .",
    "first , it can localize @xmath24 simultaneous sound sources using only @xmath24 spectrogram time frames . for @xmath132 and 50 db snr , @xmath133 of the 250,000 individual sources",

    "this is impossible using methods such as music @xcite , where at least @xmath2 and typically more time frames are required to reliably estimate spatial covariance matrices .",
    "second , the @xmath24 sound sources are jointly localized without using source separation , even though their spectra are strongly overlapping ( white noise ) .",
    "this makes the method intrinsically efficient computationally , and contrasts with many existing multiple sound source localization methods , which rely on source separation @xcite .",
    "these two features put forward grtfs as a promising tool to efficiently localize multiple sound sources using short time windows .",
    "this ability may turn out to be critical , _",
    "e.g. _ , in realistic human - robot interaction scenarios where sound sources may be fast moving and computational resources are limited .",
    "we proposed a natural way of generalizing relative transfer functions to @xmath24 sources using @xmath24 spectro - temporal observations , where @xmath24 is lower than the number of microphones . to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "this is the first study of this kind in signal processing .",
    "this work is mostly preliminary and theoretical . in the future",
    ", we plan an in - depth theoretical and empirical study of the noisy case , and an extension to natural sounds with sparse spectrograms such as speech .",
    "moreover , several leads will be investigated to improve robustness to noise , _",
    "e.g. _ , estimating the number of sources , combining plcker transforms of different orders and weighting time - frequency observations .",
    "finally , the possibility of learning the mapping function from grtfs to source directions will be investigated , following @xcite .",
