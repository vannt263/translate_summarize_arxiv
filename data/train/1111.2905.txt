    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a fundamental property of a stellar population , with wide ranging implications for many areas of astrophysics .",
    "observations in the galactic disk suggest that the imf has a power - law shape , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 at masses above @xmath14 ( salpeter 1955 ) , and that it turns over at lower masses ( kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the imf is generally assumed to be universal , although there is increasing evidence that the imf depends on the mass ( or velocity ) of a galaxy .",
    "spiral galaxies require imfs lighter than salpeter ( bell & de jong 2001 ; dutton 2011 a , b ; brewer 2012 ) and maybe even lighter than chabrier ( bershady 2011 ) . while elliptical galaxies favor salpeter - type imfs ( auger 2010 ) , and possibly bottom heavy ( @xmath15 ) imfs in the most massive ellipticals ( van dokkum & conroy 2010 ) .    total mass measurements from dynamics or strong lensing only give an upper limit to stellar mass - to - light ratios due to the unknown dark matter fraction",
    ". however , if we can identify a population of galaxies that are baryon dominated ( i.e. , the dark matter fraction within a specific radius @xmath16 ) , these can be used to provide a direct dynamical constraint to stellar mass - to - light ratios , and hence the imf .    in this letter",
    "we show that early - type galaxies with the highest stellar surface densities within an effective radius have a fundamental plane ( fp ; dressler 1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) correlation that is consistent with the virial prediction : at fixed sps stellar mass , velocity dispersions and half - light radii scale as @xmath17 .",
    "this is strong evidence that the dynamical masses are proportional to the stellar masses . under the additional assumption that any dark matter does not trace the light , the dynamical masses are equal to the stellar masses .",
    "here we use spherical jeans models to calculate dynamical masses and compare these with sps stellar masses .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "our selection of early - type galaxies is designed to select non - star forming galaxies regardless of their morphology or structure , and is the same as in dutton ( 2011a ) .",
    "our starting sample consists of @xmath21 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york 2000 ) data release seven ( dr7 ) ( abazajian 2009 ) with spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath22 ) , stellar velocity dispersions , @xmath23 , from the `` princeton '' catalog , structural parameters ( using the srsic @xmath24 plus @xmath25 fits ) from simard ( 2011 ) , and stellar masses computed assuming a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf from the mpa / jhu group ( available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr7/ ) .",
    "we select galaxies that have been spectroscopically classified as early - type ( eclass @xmath26 ) , have red @xmath27 colors , and have minor - to - major axis ratios greater than 0.5 .",
    "we also apply redshift dependent minimum stellar mass .",
    "our selection yields @xmath28 early - type galaxies at redshifts of @xmath29 ( 68% range ) .    using the stellar masses , @xmath30 , and the circularized @xmath31band effective radii , @xmath32 , we compute the average surface density within the effective radius : @xmath33 .",
    "we select a sample of dense galaxies with the criteria @xmath34 .",
    "this yields @xmath35 galaxies , i.e. , @xmath36 of our full early - type galaxy sample . while the exact value of this minimum density is somewhat arbitrary , its approximate value will become apparent below . in order to minimize the impact of galaxies scattered to high stellar densities by the @xmath37 dex measurement errors on stellar masses , we clean the sample by using the relation between @xmath38 and @xmath23",
    "this relation has a slope of @xmath39 and a scatter of @xmath40 dex .",
    "we remove the outlier galaxies that are more than @xmath41 offset from the median relation .",
    "this removes @xmath42 galaxies leaving a dense sample of @xmath43 .",
    "the velocity - mass and size - mass scaling relations for our full and dense samples of early - type galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm ] .",
    "the median relations of the full samples are shown with points and solid lines , while the high density galaxies are shown with a color scale . in the size - mass relation",
    "our selection corresponds to a line of slope 1/2 .",
    "all of the dense galaxies are offset by at least @xmath44 from the median size - mass relation . in the velocity - mass plane",
    "the dense galaxies have a slope of 0.25 and a are offset to high velocity dispersions .",
    "the assumption of mass - follows - light ( mfl ) is sometimes used when modeling the stellar kinematics of luminous early - type galaxies ( e.g. , cappellari 2006 ) .",
    "there are two issues with mfl models : 1 ) mfl models only provide an upper limit to the stellar mass due to the unknown dark matter fraction ; 2 ) if there is a significant amount of dark matter , then the assumption of mfl likely fails and the dynamical masses will be biased .",
    "one can get around these two problems by selecting galaxies for which the dark matter fraction is negligible . to select such a sample we use the correlations between velocity and size at fixed stellar mass .",
    "the simplest mass follows light models have the scaling @xmath45 .",
    "it is well known that the fundamental plane is tilted with respect to this model . here",
    "we express the fp relation as the correlation between residuals from the velocity dispersion vs stellar mass ( @xmath46 ) and effective radius vs stellar mass ( @xmath47 ) relations .",
    "we label the slope of the correlation as @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is related to the dark matter fraction within the radius the velocities are measured ( courteau & rix 1999 ; dutton 2007 ) . models with no dark matter nominally have @xmath50 , while dark matter dominated galaxies have @xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dvr ] the solid black line shows the fp relation for all early - type galaxies . fitting a linear relation gives a slope @xmath52 ( red line ) which is shallower than the virial prediction ( dotted line ) .",
    "this recovers the well known tilt of the fp .",
    "it is also apparent that the local value of @xmath49 varies monotonically with size offset .",
    "galaxies with the most negative offsets have @xmath53 , while galaxies with the most positive offsets have @xmath54 .",
    "this trend is qualitatively consistent with the expectations for galaxies embedded in extended dark matter haloes .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : dvr ] we see that galaxies with @xmath55 have a local slope of @xmath53 and thus are consistent with the assumption of mfl .",
    "this offset is the motivation behind our particular density selection as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rm ] .",
    "the colored points in fig .",
    "[ fig : dvr2 ] show the fp relation for galaxies in our dense sample , split into high and low stellar masses .",
    "the low mass galaxies in our sample , @xmath56 , ( red points ) have @xmath53 which suggests that these galaxies are dominated by stars within an effective radius ( courteau & rix 1999 ) .",
    "however , the massive galaxies , @xmath57 , ( blue points ) have a weaker correlation , suggesting that mass does not follow light .    the possibility that dark matter follows",
    "the light in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies has been discussed by thomas ( 2011 ) .",
    "however , this scenario seems unlikely for our dense galaxies , since at the effective radius the slopes of the stellar mass profiles are @xmath58 , while the dark matter is expected to have @xmath59 .",
    "thus in what follows we can only strictly justify mfl models for the lower mass dense galaxies .",
    "however , using relations from macci ( 2008 ) and dutton ( 2010 ) , we estimate the dark matter fractions within @xmath60 to be just @xmath61 .",
    "we will still compute mfl models for the high mass dense galaxies , with the caveat that dark matter may provide a non - negligible contribution to the dynamical masses .",
    "our dense - low mass sample consists of @xmath62 galaxies with median sps masses @xmath63 , velocity dispersions @xmath64 , and fiber aperture radii of @xmath65 .",
    "the relatively large aperture radii results in an additional benefit when deriving dynamical masses from aperture velocity dispersions . for small apertures",
    "relative to the effective radius ( e.g. , one eighth of an effective radius ) , the derived dynamical masses are strongly dependent on the anisotropy profile .",
    "when the aperture is larger than the effective radius the anisotropy is only of secondary importance .",
    "for each galaxy in our high - density sample we calculate a dynamical mass using the following procedure . given a galaxy light profile ( parameterized by circularized and deprojected srsic @xmath24 and @xmath25 components  see dutton 2011a ) with mass normalized to @xmath66 , we calculate the radial velocity dispersion profile by solving the spherical jeans equations assuming a constant anisotropy , @xmath7 ( e.g. , binney & mamon 1982 ) .",
    "we then compute the projected velocity dispersion ( convolved with 1.4 arcsec fwhm seeing ) within the 3 arcsec diameter aperture used by sdss .",
    "finally , we compute a dynamical mass by scaling the model aperture velocity dispersion to match the observed aperture velocity dispersion : @xmath67    note that since the model velocity dispersions scale as @xmath68 ( because we assume mass - follows - light ) our dynamical masses are actually independent of the sps masses .",
    "our procedure also takes into account structural non - homology , which can significantly effect dynamical masses ( e.g. , taylor 2010 ) .",
    "while our models do not account for rotation , cappellari ( 2006 ) have shown that two and three integral models yield dynamical masses that are consistent with those obtained from a simple virial relation @xmath69 for both fast- and slow - rotators , which thus supports our use of spherical jeans models .",
    "in addition we have verified that the dynamical masses show no correlation with axis ratio .    for isotropic orbits ( @xmath9 ) the median offset between dynamical and sps masses for the full dense sample",
    "is @xmath70 . for the low- and high - mass subsamples",
    "we find @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "as expected the dynamical masses are only weakly dependent on the assumed velocity anisotropy ( @xmath7 ) . for reasonable values of velocity anisotropy ( @xmath73 ) for early - type galaxies ( gerhard 2001 ; koopmans 2009 ) the dynamical masses differ by just 4% ( with lower dynamical masses for higher @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , on average , our results are in excellent agreement with a salpeter imf ( @xmath74 ) , but are strongly inconsistent with lighter milky - way imfs ( e.g. , kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ) , or heavier imfs found in the centers of more massive ellipticals ( van dokkum & conroy 2010 ) .",
    "[ fig : mdyn - mstar ] shows the relation between dynamical and sps masses for @xmath9 .",
    "the dotted lines show the relations expected for various imfs , ranging from chabrier to @xmath75 . due to the non - uniform distribution of @xmath66 ( which is well approximated by a log - normal ) , and the scatter in @xmath76 of @xmath77 dex",
    ", the slope of the true relation between @xmath6 and @xmath66 will depend on the origin of the scatter .",
    "if the scatter is entirely due to @xmath6 the slope is @xmath78 ( solid line ) , while if the scatter is entirely due to @xmath66 the slope is @xmath79 ( dashed line ) . in practice",
    "there are likely errors on both masses , and the true slope of the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath66 will fall between these two limiting cases . the nominal measurement errors on @xmath66 of @xmath80 dex , imply a true relation of @xmath81 .    since dynamical mass is proportional to the square of velocity dispersion , our results are consistent with the notion that the imf depends on the velocity dispersion of the galaxy , with heavier imfs in higher dispersion galaxies ( treu 2010 ; van dokkum & conroy 2011 ) .",
    "such a trend is also consistent with the lighter imfs favored for spiral galaxies ( e.g. , bershady 2011 ) , which tend to have lower velocities than ellipticals .",
    "however , since velocity dispersion correlates with other physical galaxy properties ( e.g. , graves 2009 ) , variation in the imf may be driven by other properties of a stellar population , such as age or metallicity .      fig .",
    "[ fig : delta - color ] shows that the imf offset parameter is correlated with color , with the sense that redder galaxies have heavier imfs .",
    "this relation is given by @xmath82.\\ ] ] here the colors and luminosities have been k - corrected to @xmath83 ( but not evolution corrected ) . extrapolating eq .",
    "[ eq : imf - color ] to bluer colors , a chabrier imf ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) occurs at a color of @xmath85 , which is typical for a @xmath86 late - type galaxy ( e.g. , fig.1 of dutton 2011a ) .    a color dependence to the imf could plausibly be related to the idea that the characteristic mass scale of the imf is set by the jeans mass of the ism , which depends on both temperature and density ( bate & bonnel 2005 ; larson 2005 ) .",
    "a density dependence would take the form of heavier imfs for stars formed in denser regions .",
    "since more massive galaxies formed their stars at higher densities , and more massive galaxies have older and redder stellar populations , it follows that galaxies that formed their stars at higher densities ( with heavier imfs ) should have redder colors .      with the goal of providing a useful estimator of stellar mass - to - light ratios , fig .",
    "[ fig : mdyn - l ] shows the relations between dynamical ( and sps ) mass - to - light ratio vs @xmath27 color for a model with isotropic orbits @xmath87 .",
    "sps mass - to - light ratios scale as @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
