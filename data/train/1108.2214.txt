    "quantum tunneling was first discussed by friedrich hund in 1927 when he considered the ground stateof a double - wellpotential  @xcite .",
    "quantum tunneling is a microscopic phenomenon where a particle can penetrate into and in some cases pass through a potential barrier , although the barrier is energetically higher than the kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "this motion amounts to particles penetrating areas where they have `` negative kinetic energy '' and is not allowed by the laws of classical dynamics  @xcite .",
    "double - wellpotentials can be used for the study of tunneling , as the central hump separating the two wells constitutes a tunneling barrier , for eigenstates lower in energy than the maximum height of the barrier .",
    "they are also used for the study of molecular structures , for example in the ammonia molecule  @xcite .",
    "the concept of quantum tunneling is central to the operation of scanning tunneling microscopes  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate tunneling in partially exactly solvable double - wellpotentials  @xcite through the use of the wigner quasi - probability distributionfunction .",
    "we model tunneling based on the dynamics of the lowest two wave functions , the quantum mechanical ground stateand the first excitedstate  @xcite .",
    "we also present the probability distributions with respect to momentum and position , and illustrate the presence of quantum coherences , which give rise to interference fringes with negative values of wigner s quasi - probability distribution .    in the next section ,",
    "we provide a self - consistent discussion of the partially exactly solvable symmetric and asymmetric double - wellpotentials , first established in  @xcite . in section  [ sec : wignerfunction ] we introduce wigner s quasi - probability distributionfunction and illustrate , for each case of the double - wellpotential , time - evolution of the associated wigner quasi - probability distribution , and probability distributions with respect to position and momentum .",
    "subsection  [ sec : quantumcoherence ] considers negative regions of wigner s quasi - probability distributionfunction and allows us to visualize non - classical spatial coherences in tunneling , finally we conclude .",
    "a family of partially exactly solvable double - wellpotentials was introduced in 1995 by caticha  @xcite ; for these the ground and first excitedstates ( and in some cases states energetically above those ) can be computed analytically in simple closed forms .",
