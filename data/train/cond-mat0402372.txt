    "in the reference @xcite a deterministic multifractal tilling is developed to study percolation in multifractal systems .",
    "this object is a natural generalization of the square lattice in which it is possible to estimate analytically the full spectrum of fractal dimensions .",
    "besides it exhibits a rich distribution of area among the blocks and a non - trivial topology , the number of neighbors varies along the object .",
    "the multifractal , however , is deterministic in its construction . in spite of its properties it lacks the random ingredients found in natural systems . in order to make the model more realistic we develop a random version of this model .    in this work",
    "we develop a multifractal that has the following characteristics .",
    "it has an infinite number of subsets each one with a distinct fractal dimension . for a specific case",
    "we determine analytically the dimension of each subset .",
    "the sum of all the subsets fills completely the square .",
    "the algorithm of construction of the multifractal has two or more free parameters , @xmath1 , that are related to the stretching of its subsets . during the construction of the multifractal",
    "there is random choice of @xmath1 which makes the object non deterministic .",
    "for the special case of just one parameter @xmath4 the object degenerates into the square lattice .",
    "the extension of the model for an arbitrary dimension is trivial .",
    "finally the algorithm for construction of the multifractal is simple and easily implemented in the computer .",
    "geologic structures can show multifractal characteristics @xcite in physical properties like porosity , permeability , or sound velocity .",
    "in addition the rocks and strata are not deterministic objects , but present random features .",
    "these geologic systems that combine multifractality and randomness are natural candidates to be modeled by the proposed model .",
    "the deterministic multifractal is an intuitive generalization of the square lattice .",
    "suppose that in the construction of the square lattice we use the following algorithm : take a square of size @xmath5 and cut it symmetrically with vertical and horizontal lines .",
    "repeat this process @xmath6-times ; at the @xmath7 step we have a regular lattice with @xmath8 cells .",
    "the setup algorithm of the deterministic multifractal is quite similar , the main difference is that we do not cut the square in a symmetric way , but according to a given constant ratio .",
    "the random multifractal is an extension of the deterministic model . in the random multifractal",
    "we use a non constant ratio in the algorithm setup .",
    "the main objective of this work is to present a random multifractal tilling and determine its set of fractal dimensions for a specific case .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section @xmath9 we present the deterministic multifractal and review the derivation of its set of fractal dimensions . in section",
    "@xmath10 we develop the random multifractal and indicate a formula that estimate its set of fractal dimensions for the case of random choice between two given distinct @xmath1 . finally in section",
    "@xmath11 we summarize the main differences between deterministic and random multifractal tillings and give our final remarks .",
    "we start with a square of linear size @xmath5 and a parameter @xmath12 , for integers @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the first step , @xmath15 , consists of making one vertical section of the square .",
    "the square is cut in two pieces of areas @xmath16 and @xmath17 by a vertical segment .",
    "this process is shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) , where we use @xmath18 .",
    "the step @xmath19 consists of a horizontal cut with the same section @xmath20 , this step is shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) . at this point there are four rectangular blocks : the largest one of area @xmath21 , two of area @xmath22 and the smallest one of area @xmath23 .",
    "we call a set of all elements with the same area as a @xmath24-set . at the step @xmath19",
    "there are three @xmath24-sets .    in the third step , @xmath25 , we repeat the same process of vertical section as in step @xmath15 . at @xmath26",
    "we make new horizontal sections .",
    "all the sections have the same ratio @xmath20 . at the @xmath27-step",
    "there are @xmath28 blocks .",
    "the partition process produces a set of blocks with a variety of areas . at the step @xmath0 we have @xmath29 @xmath24-sets .",
    "the construction process of the deterministic multifractal is done by vertical and horizontal sections of the square . as the section ratio is always the same and the segment section",
    "is displaced in space the object shows self - affinity .    at the @xmath27-step of the algorithm ,",
    "the partition of the area of the square follows the binomial rule : @xmath30 or : @xmath31 the number of elements of each @xmath24-set in this case is @xmath32 .",
    "each @xmath24-set determines a specific dimension . for the estimation of the spectrum of fractal dimension @xmath33 of an object",
    "@xmath34 we use the box counting method @xcite .",
    "the object @xmath34 is immersed in the plane of real numbers @xmath35 , we use the trivial metric .",
    "we cover the object by just - touching square boxes of side length @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the number of square cells of side length @xmath36 which intersect @xmath34 . if @xmath38 is finite , then @xmath39 is the dimension of the @xmath34 .    in our case",
    "the object @xmath34 is a @xmath24-set .",
    "remember that the @xmath24-set corresponds to a set of rectangles of the same area .",
    "if the square is partitioned @xmath0 times we have @xmath40 . for each @xmath24-set the area of blocks ( using @xmath36 area units )",
    "is done by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the binomial coefficient that express the number of elements @xmath24-type , and @xmath43 is the area of each element of this set .",
    "we put together all these elements to have the fractal dimension of each @xmath24-set : @xmath44 the case @xmath45 is degenerated . in this situation the subsets of the lattice are composed uniquely by square cells of the same area",
    ". therefore the tilling is formed by a single subset of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the spectrum of @xmath33 for several values of @xmath20 .",
    "we plot in the @xmath46-axis the normalized @xmath24-set , @xmath47 , and in the @xmath48-axis the respective @xmath33 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a @xmath20 that is very closed to @xmath5 in this situation the blocks have almost the same area and @xmath33 is a symmetric curve . in the opposite situation",
    "@xmath49 we have curves that correspond to a tilling in which the blocks are very stretched in one direction . in the figure",
    "it is also depicted the curves corresponding to @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in the last section we use a constant @xmath20 through all the @xmath0-steps of the construction of the multifractal . a more realistic generalization of the above process is to use different values of the ratio @xmath20 along the growing process of the multifractal . in the general case a random @xmath1 is used at each step of the algorithm . in this work",
    "we explore in more detail the case where at each @xmath0-step of the construction of the multifractal we randomly choose between two rational values @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "the picture of this process is similar to figure [ fig1 ] , but this time the section of the square does not follow a constant ratio making the partition of the square asymmetric .",
    "we have in the algorithm of the random multifractal the following choices . at @xmath15",
    "we divide the square in two blocks .",
    "there are two partition possibilities for the square : @xmath56 and @xmath57 or @xmath58 e @xmath59 . at the second step , @xmath19 , there are two possibilities for each former configuration .",
    "these are the three partition possibilities at step @xmath19 :    @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath61 ,    or @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ,    or @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath68 .",
    "note that there are not four configurations but only three .",
    "in fact , it is the same to make a section @xmath70 after @xmath71 , or @xmath71 after @xmath70 .    at the step @xmath0 , @xmath70",
    "is chosen @xmath6 times and @xmath71 is chosen @xmath72 times for @xmath73 . at each step the areas of the blocks are obtained by the multiplication of the area of the block of the former step . therefore the partition of the area of the square is done by the following equation : @xmath74 @xmath75 this formula is analogous to equation ( [ bino2 ] ) of the deterministic case .",
    "the occurrence of blocks of the same @xmath24-sets ( objects of same area ) is smaller for this case compared with the deterministic model . otherwise , the quantity of @xmath24-sets is larger , it is done by @xmath76 .",
    "the determination of the spectrum of fractal dimensions for the case of the multifractal is similar to the deterministic case , equation ( [ boxcou2 ] ) .",
    "the equation for @xmath33 in this case is the following : @xmath77 where the set of @xmath24 corresponds to any combination of @xmath6 and @xmath72 such that @xmath78 .",
    "the generalization of this formula for several @xmath1 ( for the case where each @xmath1 obeys @xmath79 ) is performed by the introduction of new terms @xmath80 in the numerator .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the curve in crescent order of fractal dimensions @xmath33 . in the @xmath48-axis",
    "is plotted @xmath33 and in the @xmath46-axis , @xmath81 , the respective @xmath24-set .",
    "we notice that the @xmath24-sets in the @xmath46-axis are shown in order of crescent @xmath33 .",
    "the area of the @xmath24-sets is normalized between zero and one . in the figure",
    "there are three curves @xmath82 ( point line ) , @xmath83 ( dashed line ) , and the random curve ( thick line ) . in this simulation",
    "we use @xmath84 .",
    "the random curve is defined as the spectrum that results from the random choice between @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the estimation of the random curve is performed assuming that for @xmath85 we have @xmath86 .",
    "a typical view of the the deterministic and the random multifractals is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "these two pictures show the deterministic multifractal ( a ) and one realization of the random multifractal ( b ) . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) we use @xmath87 and in figure [ fig4 ] ( b ) @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in both situations we evolved the algorithm until @xmath88 .",
    "in this work we develop a random self - affine multifractal object that forms a tilling of the square .",
    "the multifractal is constructed by an algorithm that make successive sections of the square . in the special case where the section ratio is @xmath89",
    "the algorithm generates the well known square lattice . at each @xmath0-step",
    "there is a random choice of partition parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we explore in detail the case in which the ratio choice done is between two specific values @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for this situation at the limit of infinite partition of the square , @xmath85 , we find analytically the full spectrum of fractal dimensions .    in the references @xcite the deterministic multifractal object",
    "was used to study percolation properties and the breaking of universality class in two dimensions .",
    "in fact , the critical exponent related to the correlation length for the deterministic multifractal is not universal , it means , it is not the same as in standard percolation in two dimensions .",
    "this fact is related with the breaking of local isotropy .",
    "there are some points to consider in the symmetry properties of this multifractal object and its isotropy .",
    "the first is related with the stretching of the blocks of the multifractal which increases as @xmath49 .",
    "moreover the topology of multifractal , specially its coordination number , changes along the object .",
    "the object we develop in this work is a natural candidate to extend the cited papers to a non deterministic analyses of the breaking of universality class . in special",
    "we intend to analyze the reason for the breaking of universality class in the random multifractal and how the local isotropy affects this process ."
