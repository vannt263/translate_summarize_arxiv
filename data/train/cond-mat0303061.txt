    "theoretical studies of neural network models of associative memory often involve the development of tools to study the dynamics of the network . in most simple models ,",
    "the basic processing elements ( `` neurons '' ) are assumed to be two - state ( ising spin ) variables , and the dynamics of the network is described by `` update rules '' that specify how the state of a neuron ( spin ) is governed by its net synaptic input ( local field ) due to the other neurons ( spins ) in the network .",
    "the interactions between different neurons are specified by the synaptic matrix obtained from the learning rule employed for the model @xcite .",
    "dynamical studies shed light on the pattern recall process and its relation with the choice of the initial state , the learning rule , symmetry of the synaptic interaction matrix , etc . while methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics can be profitably used @xcite to analyse the behaviour of neural network models with symmetric synaptic connections , dynamical techniques are the _ only _ tools available for the study of models with non - symmetric synaptic matrices .",
    "since one is generally interested in the behaviour of large networks , a common strategy is to move away from the `` microscopic '' description of the dynamics of individual neurons and to derive a `` macroscopic '' description in terms of quantities ( such as suitably defined  order parameters \" ) that depend on the states of many neurons .",
    "the crucial question in this context is how the dynamical equations that describe the behaviour of these macroscopic quantities are to be derived from the microscopic dynamics of the neurons .",
    "the generating functional technique @xcite , which has been used extensively to study the dynamics of spin glasses and other disordered spin systems , provides an appropriate framework to accomplish this task .",
    "this technique has been used to study the synchronous dynamics of the hopfield model @xcite and its asymmetric version @xcite .",
    "although the method allows , in principle , a calculation of all the properties of the network after an arbitrary number of time steps , it can , for all practical purposes , be used to follow the dynamics only for a few time steps because the the number of order parameters required in this description increases very quickly as the number of time steps is increased .",
    "this is not satisfactory because , in order to analyse the retrieval properties of a neural network , one needs a method that allows a study of the dynamics for long times .",
    "one can , of course , use numerical simulations for networks of finite size .",
    "however , extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit may be quite non - trivial @xcite .",
    "eisffeller and opper have developed a numerical method for studying the parallel dynamics of the well - known sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite model of spin glass with symmetric @xcite and asymmetric interactions @xcite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this method combines the generating functional method , which allows taking the thermodynamic limit exactly , and a monte carlo simulation of the resulting self - consistent single - spin stochastic dynamics .",
    "we have used this method to study the dynamics of pattern retrieval in a simple model of associative memory with one stored pattern .",
    "this model is essentially the same as the sk spin - glass model with an interaction matrix that has a ferromagnetic component : the probability distribution of each element of the interaction matrix has a positive average",
    ". the ferromagnetic state in this model corresponds to the stored memory , and the random part of the interaction parameters represents the interference effects of the `` other '' memories in hopfield - type models with a macroscopic number of stored patterns .",

    "our study leads to a characterization of the retrieval behavior of this network as a function of this parameter .",

    "the aim here is to shed light on the behavior of hopfield - type models with random asymmetry in the synaptic connections .",

    "we find that the finite - time dynamical behaviour of the system exhibits a qualitative change at @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the acquisition strength of the stored pattern ( relative strength of the ferromagnetic part of the interactions ) .",
    "this change may be described as a transition from spin - glass - like behaviour to ferromagnet - like behavior .",

    "the system exhibits a simple phase - space structure where all initial states with @xmath0 flow to the attractor corresponding to the stored pattern .",
    "the phase - space structure for smaller values of @xmath3 is complex , with many attractors with their basins of attraction . in the model with symmetric couplings ,",
    "the process of retrieval of memory becomes very slow for small values of the initial overlap .",
    "the presence of random asymmetry in the couplings leads to an improvement in the retrieval performance of the network .",

    "the remanent overlap @xmath121 was found to vanish at the same value of @xmath15 , and the value of @xmath158 was found to be 0.825 . for @xmath159 , we find both quantitative and qualitative deviations in the behavior of @xmath63 from those reported in ref .",
    "the value of @xmath158 increases beyond 0.825 as @xmath3 is increased from zero .",
    "for example for @xmath152 , we have exponential relaxation for values of @xmath15 as high as 0.95 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "moreover , @xmath121 vanishes for @xmath160 .",
    "it is only at @xmath50 that @xmath161 .",
    "the value of @xmath162 decreases as @xmath3 is increased . for example , for @xmath126 , @xmath163 whereas for @xmath152 @xmath164 .",
    "furthermore , in the ferromagnetic phase , we find that over a considerable range of values of @xmath15 , there is very little variation in the values of @xmath121 , e.g. for @xmath152 , @xmath121 varies from 0.80 to 0.72 when @xmath15 is reduced from 1 to 0 .",
    "this feature of the network is highly desirable when the possibility of functional improvement is explored in the presence of asymmetry in the couplings .",
    "it ensures that the retrieval quality does not suffer significantly when @xmath154 .",
    "when @xmath3 is sufficiently large , @xmath121 always remains close to unity , e.g. , for @xmath149 , @xmath121 varies 0.94 to 0.92 when @xmath15 is varied in its full range from 1 to @xmath165 .",
    "studies of models of spin glasses and neural networks suggest that the presence of asymmetry of an appropriate magnitude in the synaptic interaction matrix may result in the improvement of the performance of the network as an associative memory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on this aspect ) .",
    "it is expected that the asymmetry may destabilize some of the spurious attractors which do not correspond any stored pattern .",
    "if this happens , then the basin of attraction of the stored patterns would increase in size and the retrieval of memory would become faster .",
    "we find evidence of both of these effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show the evolution of the overlap @xmath63 for various values of initial overlap ranging from @xmath166 to @xmath118 for @xmath147 and @xmath167 . it can be easily seen that all these initial states converge to the same attractor with @xmath168 .",
    "this signifies a considerable enhancement in the size of the basin of attraction when we compare this behaviour with that in fig .",
    "note , however , that the retrieval quality has degraded in the model with synaptic asymmetry : the attractor corresponding the stored pattern has 68@xmath169 overlap with the pattern for @xmath115 compared to the @xmath170 overlap for @xmath167 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we plot @xmath63 for @xmath152 and @xmath171 for various values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath15 .",
    "it is very clear that the retrieval of memory becomes faster as the asymmetry in couplings is increased . by fitting @xmath63 with the function given in eq .",
    "( [ fittingfunction2 ] ) , we find that the time constant @xmath157 reduces from 55.56 to 4.61 when @xmath15 is varied from 0.95 to 0.6 . at the same time",
    ", the value of the final overlap @xmath133 does not change much , indicating that the quality of retrieval is not substantially affected by the introduction of asymmetry in the synaptic interactions .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the synchronous dynamics of a one - pattern model of associative memory using a mean field monte carlo method . though simple",
    ", the model embodies sufficient richness to be useful in predicting the behavior of some of the more complicated models of associative memory such as the asymmetric hopfield model .",
    "the two relevant parameters in the model are the acquisition strength @xmath3 of the stored pattern and the symmetry parameter @xmath15 . for symmetric couplings ( @xmath115 ) , we find evidence for a transition at @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath172 , we have a spin glass phase in which the retrieval overlap with the stored pattern is small , arising from a  remanence effect \" ( non - ergodic relaxation of the system through a complex energy landscape ) .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath143 we have a ferromagnetic phase where the retrieval overlap with the stored pattern increases rapidly with @xmath3 and becomes very close to unity .",
    "values of @xmath173 would be required for a reasonable retrieval of the memory . inside the ferromagnetic phase ,",
    "we find the existence of two types of phase - space structure in the subspace of states having nonzero overlaps with the stored pattern .",
    "for example , for @xmath149 , we have a relatively simple phase - space structure where all initial states with a nonzero overlap with the stored pattern flow to the attractor corresponding to the stored pattern .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath174 there are many attractors with their own basins of attraction .",
    "we also find that the process of retrieval becomes very slow for small values of @xmath34 .",
    "when random asymmetry is introduced in the couplings ( @xmath154 ) , we find that it results , in general , in better retrieval performance of the network by enhancing the size of the basin of attraction of the stored pattern , as well as by making the recall of memory significantly faster .",
    "how do the results described above compare with those obtained for the hopfield model with random asymmetric interactions @xcite ?",
    "numerical simulations in ref . @xcite",
    "have shown that the presence of asymmetry in the synaptic interaction matrix makes the convergence to spurious attractors slower .",
    "on the other hand , the convergence time for correct retrieval is only marginally increased in the presence of asymmetry .",
    "thus , asymmetry in the synaptic interaction matrix enhances the performance of the hopfield net as an associative memory by providing a way of discriminating between spurious and retrieval attractors by looking at the dynamics of the network . in the model studied here ,",
    "the improvement in performance occurs in a more direct manner : the retrieval becomes faster in the presence of asymmetry in the synaptic interaction matrix .",
    "furthermore , the simulation results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that the introduction of asymmetry in the synaptic interaction matrix does not cause any enhancement of the typical size of the basins of attraction of stored patterns in the hopfield model .",
    "here we do find an enhancement of the size of the basin of attraction of the stored pattern .",
    "however , this occurs for a very restricted range of values of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "these results may be indicative of the enlargement of the basin of attraction being a model specific feature .",
    "confirmation of some of these issues by extending the method used here to the asymmetric hopfield model and to other models using different learning rules would be most interesting . a somewhat straightforward generalization of the technique for the case of two stored patterns with different acquisition strengths would provide useful insights into how the storage of other patterns , e.g. , in the hopfield model , would modify the results described above .",
    "furthermore , this method may also be useful in analysing the effect of asymmetry in the synaptic interaction matrix of models of short - term memory @xcite .",
