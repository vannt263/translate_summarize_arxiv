    "for example , results of deep near - infrared observations show the average stellar mass density at @xmath9 is @xmath10 of that in the present universe , while at @xmath11 it is just @xmath12 of the present value @xcite .",
    "although such studies demonstrate the total star formation rate ( sfr ) density in the universe as a function of cosmic time , it is still uncertain which populations of galaxies contribute to the active star formation between redshift 1 and 3 .",
    "the evolution of the stellar mass - sfr relation constrains theoretical views of how galaxies accumulate the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , as a next step , in order to understand the build up of stellar mass in galaxies at this redshift range , it is crucial to examine the relationship of sfr to stellar mass .",
    "sfrs are often estimated from photometric indicators that are closely related to the emission from massive stars @xcite .",
    "massive stars have short lifetimes , so they represent stars which were born recently . the uv continuum ( 15002800 )",
    "directly reflects the number of massive stars , and therefore can be used as an indicator of sfr for galaxies in this redshift range . additionally , far - infrared emission is another indicator of sfr ; the uv emission of young massive stars is absorbed by interstellar dust and reradiated in the far - infrared at @xmath1381000@xmath2 m .",
    "fluxes at 24@xmath2 m wavelength taken with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) are commonly used to estimate far - infrared emission of galaxies at high redshifts , because observations in longer wavelengths are too shallow to detect such galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath14-selected galaxies at @xmath7 have a tight correlation ( @xmath15dex ) between stellar mass and sfr estimated from uv and ir luminosities .",
    "the sfrs of these galaxies are roughly proportional to their stellar masses .",
    "however , the relation is not still conclusive .",
    "other studies show different relationships between sfrs and stellar masses .",
    "for example , rest - uv selected bm / bx galaxies also have a correlation between these values but the correlation is not proportional @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sfrs of 24@xmath2m - selected galaxies do not depend on their stellar masses @xcite .",
    "we need to note that sfrs estimated from uv and ir luminosities have large uncertainties .",
    "uv light is affected by dust extinction and stars with long lifetimes of @xmath16gyr . on the other hand",
    ", 24@xmath2 m radiation corresponds to the rest - frame 8@xmath2 m wavelength for galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that the far - infrared luminosity estimated from rest-8@xmath2 m luminosity has a large uncertainty due to the complex sed at those wavelengths @xcite .",
    "luminosity is one of the most reliable indicators of sfr .",
    "first , the emission line is reemitted from hydrogen gas ionized by uv photons shorter than 912 , which are radiated by only the most massive stars .",
    "these stars have shorter lifetimes than stars emitting the uv continuum above 1500 .",
    "second , the emission line is less affected by dust extinction than uv emission .",
    "the amount of dust extinction is larger at shorter wavelengths .",
    "third , the h@xmath3 luminosity can be measured without the uncertainty inherent in sed estimates for the far - infrared luminosity .",
    "however , it is difficult to measure h@xmath3 luminosities of galaxies at high redshift , because the h@xmath3 emission line at @xmath17 is out of the wavelength range of optical spectrographs .    recently , near - infrared spectroscopic studies of sfrs based on the h@xmath3 luminosity for large samples of star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 have been conducted @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrate a weak correlation between sfr estimated from h@xmath3 luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "their sample galaxies are selected by @xmath18 color and have redshifts confirmed using a blue - sensitive optical spectrograph .",
    "the observed galaxies are biased toward less attenuated galaxies .",
    "since red galaxies account for the significant fraction of stellar mass density at @xmath7 @xcite , the galaxies at @xmath7 should be re - examined with a technique more sensitive to red galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath14-selected galaxies ) .",
    "the @xmath14-selected star - forming galaxies observed by @xcite showed a flatter sfr - stellar mass correlation than that of @xcite , but the number of @xmath14-selected galaxies with h@xmath3 detection is still rather limited and observations for a larger sample are necessary .    in this work ,",

    "the flux limit of the catalog ( @xmath32 ) corresponds to @xmath33 at @xmath34 using the infrared sed templates by @xcite ; thus the galaxies in the mips source catalog are as luminous as ( ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies .",

    "we selected 18 sbzk - mips galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we added 19 sbzk galaxies not listed in the mips public catalog to the list of targets ( sbzk - non - mips galaxies , hereafter ) .",

    "red sbzk - non - mips galaxies are relatively rare , so that the scaled number in the redder bin is too small ( @xmath39 ) to provide robust statistics given the present sample size .",
    "we utilize publicly available multi - wavelength data of goods - n to exclude possible agn which may contaminate the optical star - formation emission .",
    "the hard x - ray luminosity at the detection limit of the _ chandra _ deep field - north 2ms point - source catalogs @xcite at @xmath7 ( @xmath40 ) , suggests that the emission lines of the hard x - ray detected sbzk galaxies are powered by an agn rather than massive stars @xcite .",
    "x - ray sources are identified with 62 of the 508 sbzk galaxies .",
    "we exclude these sources from the present sample .",
    "rest - frame infrared colors are often used to identify agn candidates using _ spitzer _ irac bands ( 3.6@xmath2 m , 4.5@xmath2 m , 5.8@xmath2 m , and 8.0@xmath2 m ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the total exposure time was 2.55hour for each mask .",
    "the slit width was fixed to 08 for targets .",
    "most of the slit lengths were 100 or longer , depending on target positions . to monitor the flux variation due to the atmospheric absorption and photon loss at the slit mask , a bright point source was observed simultaneously on each mask , except for mask cdfn3 .",
    "the fwhms of seeing size in the @xmath1 band during the observations were typically @xmath43 . according to the atmospheric attenuation archived in the canada france hawaii telescope web site ,",

    "the observation log is summarized in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the observation followed the standard procedure for mos observation with moircs described in @xcite .",
    "the target acquisition was done using 6 to 7 alignment stars distributed over each slit mask .",
    "the telescope was dithered along the slit ( we call it an `` ab pattern '' ) by 30 , to achieve sufficient sky subtraction . the detector was read eight times in non - destructive readout mode to reduce the read out noise down to 16@xmath44 .",
    "the exposure time was set so that most of sky emission lines , which were used later for the wavelength calibration , were not saturated .",
    "the typical exposure times were 300900sec .",
    "the relative position of the alignment star against the slit mask was checked , and then the telescope pointing was adjusted every hour or two without removing the slit masks from the focal plane . the systematic guide error in one hour was measured to be @xmath4504 . at the beginning of each observing night , an a0v type star ( hip53735 ; @xmath46 ; two micron all sky survey point source catalog ; @xcite ) was observed for flux calibration with the same instrument configuration as the targets .",
    "the data reduction was made , using a semi - automatic reduction script ( moircs mos data pipelines ; mcsmdp ) , which follows the standard procedure of iraf : onedspec . at first",
    ", we make a map of bad pixels ; bad pixels are identified as those that show non - linearity .",
    "this includes dead ( always zero count ) and hot ( always high count ) pixels .",
    "cosmic rays are detected by a moving block average filter using iraf : craverage .",
    "each input frame for iraf : craverage is first divided by its dithered pair so that cosmic rays stand out behind the sky background . the cosmic - ray mask was combined with the bad pixel mask .",
    "the values of bad pixels and cosmic - ray pixels are replaced with values interpolated linearly from the pixels along the slit .",
    "sky emission lines were subtracted using the dithered pair frames ( we call the procedure `` a - b subtraction '' ) .",
    "the dome - flat frames for flat fielding were taken with the same slit mask and grism configuration as used for the observation .",
    "for the first - order distortion correction , the database for the imaging mode of moircs was applied to the spectral frames .",
    "the tilt of the spectrum against the detector rows was corrected in the cases when it was measurable in the continuum of bright objects .",
    "next , each spectrum was cut out based on a mask design file .",
    "for wavelength calibration , oh sky emission lines were identified in each frame using a night - sky spectral atlas @xcite .",
    "using the pixel coordinates of the sky emission lines , the sky - subtracted frames were transformed such that the sky lines aligned along the column of the frames and that the wavelength was a linear function of pixel coordinates .",
    "background emission still remained after a - b subtraction due to time variation of oh emission during dithering observations .",
    "the residuals were subtracted by fitting with a quadratic equation along the column . finally , all frames were weighted with the flux of the bright point source and stacked using the weighted average to obtain the final two - dimensional spectra .",
    "the response spectra , including atmospheric transmission and the instrument efficiency , are calculated using the flux standard star to convert the observed count to an absolute flux .",
    "the data of the flux standard star is reduced to a two - dimensional spectrum in the same way for galaxy targets and then the continuum is traced with a polynomial to extract a one - dimensional spectrum with iraf : apall .",
    "we calculate a model spectrum of the a0v flux standard star using spectrum ( spectrum uses @xcite model ) .",
    "the model was scaled to @xmath47 and the spectral resolution of the model was degraded to @xmath41 with a gaussian kernel , so as to give the same hydrogen line width as the observed spectra .",
    "finally , the one - dimensional spectrum of the standard star was divided by the model spectrum to obtain the response spectrum .",
    "emission lines are detected by visual inspection on the flux - calibrated two - dimensional spectra .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio evaluation described later shows that visual inspection corresponds to a larger than @xmath48 detection .",
    "the detected emission lines were integrated along slit direction within an appropriate aperture giving the largest s / n to obtain one dimensional spectra .",
    "we first consider the strongest emission line as h@xmath3 .",
    "taking account of the wavelength range where we observed and the expected redshift range of sbzk galaxies , it is the most plausible candidate for a strong emission line .",
    "the identification of h@xmath3 is confirmed in all cases when other emission lines , such as [ nii]@xmath496548,6583 , [ oiii]@xmath494959,5007 , and h@xmath50 are also detected at the expected wavelength .",
    "otherwise , we check the consistency of the redshift of the h@xmath3 emission line with that of the sed model fitting using broad - band data ( see  [ subsec : sedfit ] ) .",
    "although one of the conventional methods to estimate random error is to obtain the rms of the scattering of background counts at both sides of the object , the slit length for each object is not long enough .",
    "the readout noise is suppressed down to 16@xmath44 by non - destructive readout mode , so that the readout noise is about 1/5 of the background noise .",
    "because the readout noise and the photon noise of objects are negligible , we estimated the background noise by assuming that the random error is dominated by sky - background noise , which follows poisson statistics . in parallel to the reduction of the object spectra , sky - background spectra were reduced without the background subtraction , and the poisson error of each pixel is estimated from them .",
    "we found that the poisson error is systematically lager than the rms error by a factor of @xmath51 , though the scatter is large .",
    "the rms errors can be underestimated , because counts in the two - dimensional spectra correlate with the neighboring pixels due to the sub - pixel shift in distortion correction and wavelength calibration .    to measure the flux and central wavelength of the emission lines , we used specfit @xcite , which fits multiple emission lines and continuum simultaneously .",
    "gaussian profiles were used for emission lines .",
    "the continuum was assumed to be a linear function of wavelength .",
    "the flux of [ nii]@xmath52 was fixed to be 1/3 of [ nii]@xmath53 flux . if h@xmath50 and/or [ oiii]@xmath494959,5007 emission lines were detected on the two - dimensional spectra , we measured the flux in the same way .",
    "the random errors of the fluxes were estimated from the best - fit parameters of the model fitting based on the sky - background error described above . the emission lines detected with s / n@xmath543 are listed in table [ tab : obscat ] , and the spectra are shown in figures [ fig : haspec ] and [ fig : o3spec ] .",
    "the measured flux and the redshift derived from the central wavelength of h@xmath3 emission line are shown in table [ tab : sfrcat ] .",
    "it is difficult to accurately evaluate systematic flux error since part of the flux from the object will be lost by a slit mask ; the systematic error due to the flux loss is not negligible if we measure the total flux of emission lines from slit spectroscopy .",
    "the flux loss can be caused by a variety of things , for example , a larger size of the object than the slit width , imperfect alignment of the slit mask to the target , and misalignment of the dithering direction along the slit .",
    "first we estimated the flux loss for a point source . when a gaussian profile with fwhm = 06 , which is the typical seeing during the observations , and a slit width = 08 are assumed , fluxes passing through the slit are 88.4% of the integrated flux ; the aperture correction factor is @xmath55 .",
    "we applied this factor to the point sources observed .",
    "we found that , however , the fluxes of the point sources were still underestimated by up to @xmath56% , even if we also correct the effect of the seeing size variation and pointing error , which are measured from alignment stars .",
    "this fact indicates that imperfect alignment of dithering and/or short - time variation of the seeing size during the observations can also add to the systematic error .    on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that the flux loss for extended sources varies with the size of the sources .",
    "we calculated aperture correction factors from the ratio of total flux to that expected to come in through slits , assuming that the regions emitting stellar continuum and h@xmath3 had the same spatial distribution .",
    "the flux through a slit was measured on the @xmath1-band image with a rectangle of the same aperture size as for extracting one - dimensional spectrum and the same position angle of the slit , while the total flux was obtained from mag_auto of sextractor .",
    "the alignment error of the slit was estimated from the alignment stars on the slit mask .",
    "we found the median of the aperture correction factors to be @xmath57 with little dependence on the size of the objects .",
    "the rms scatter of the factor among the objects is @xmath58 .",
    "we apply the median value to all objects to correct the flux loss .",
    "we checked the above aperture correction method by comparing the continuum flux derived from the corrected spectrum with total magnitude , which was measured from @xmath1 or @xmath59-band imaging data according to the redshift of each galaxy .",
    "we used 7 galaxies in the sample whose stellar continuum around the h@xmath3 emission line was detected with sufficient s / n .",
    "we applied the aperture correction to the continuum flux , then contrasted the corrected flux with the total magnitude .",
    "the comparison shows that both results are consistent and the uncertainty in the aperture correction is within @xmath60 .",
    "we need to note that the assumptions on the light distribution of h@xmath3 emission line would also cause systematic errors .",
    "the h@xmath3 and continuum emitting regions would not always be similar for star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "studies with the integral - field spectrograph show that h@xmath3 emission does not trace the stellar continuum in some galaxies @xcite . however , this kind of check on our slit - spectroscopy sample is difficult , because both the continuum and emission lines are so faint that the light distribution along the slit is not able to be measured . as a lower limit of the aperture correction , when the h@xmath3 emitting region is point like , the flux becomes smaller by @xmath61 .",
    "the flux ratios of rest - optical emission lines such as [ nii]@xmath626583/h@xmath3 , [ oiii]@xmath625007/h@xmath50 , and h@xmath3/h@xmath50 provide us information on physical properties of ionized regions such as the energy sources for ionization ( [ nii]/h@xmath3 and [ oiii]/h@xmath50 ; @xcite ) , the amount of dust extinction ( balmer decrement , e.g. , h@xmath3/h@xmath50 ; @xcite ) , and gas - phase metallicity ( [ nii]/h@xmath3 ; @xcite )",
    ". however , except for h@xmath3 , the emission lines of the present sample are so faint that we can not evaluate the line ratios of an individual galaxy .",
    "therefore , we stacked the calibrated spectra in the [ nii]-h@xmath3 , and [ oiii]-h@xmath50 wavelength ranges to obtain high s / n spectra , and discuss the averaged physical properties",
    ".    the stacked spectrum @xmath63 was calculated with @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the spectrum and the total h@xmath3 flux of @xmath67 object , respectively .",
    "the spectra were re - sampled in the rest - frame wavelength scale ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the fluxes were scaled with total h@xmath3 flux , though the variety of fluxes among the samples are not large .",
    "because our main purpose of stacking is to examine the average physical properties of galaxies from their line ratio , weighted mean ( by either inverse square of noise or luminosity ) is not applied ; the line ratios of weighted mean flux could be biased toward strong emission line galaxies .",
    "we selected the objects whose spectra covered the wavelengths of redshifted h@xmath3 , [ nii ] , h@xmath50 and [ oiii ] .",
    "the emission lines of the objects which had at least h@xmath50 or [ oiii ] with @xmath69 were stacked for the measurements of the line ratios of [ nii]/h@xmath3 and [ oiii]/h@xmath50 .",
    "as a result , 9 galaxies were used for the stacking .",
    "the stacked h@xmath3-[nii ] and h@xmath50-[oiii ] spectra are shown in figure [ fig : o3stack ] .",
    "the emission lines of the stacked spectra were fitted with a combination of the same gaussian profiles and linear continuum measurements used in  [ subsec : emission ] .",
    "the best - fit spectra are also shown in figure [ fig : o3stack ] .",
    "we also made stacked spectra including the objects with neither h@xmath50 nor [ oiii ] detection , but the resultant line ratio was not changed .",
    "to evaluate the effect of galaxies which would happen to have a significantly different line ratio from the others , we used a bootstrap method .",
    "we built 1000 bootstrap sets , whose galaxies were randomly selected , allowing duplicate sampling from all galaxies used in the stacking , and stacked the spectra of the galaxies in each set to derive the line ratios .",
    "we regard the 16% and 84% quantile of the distribution as 1@xmath70 uncertainty in line ratio .      to evaluate the properties of stellar population such as stellar mass , amount of dust extinction ( @xmath71 ) , and age , we use multiband photometric data from the mods @xmath72 images and publicly available images .",

    "possible reasons for non - detections of emission lines from the remaining 14 galaxies are ; ( 1 ) their h@xmath3 emission lines are too faint for the present observations ; ( 2 ) the redshift of those galaxies are out of the @xmath100 range , where the grism ( hk500 ) we used covers the h@xmath3 wavelength ; ( 3 ) the galaxies lie at the redshift where h@xmath3 emission line falls on strong sky emission lines or atmospheric absorption bands .",
    "because the photometric redshifts and the errors of the galaxies with emission lines undetected are at @xmath101 , the second possibility is unlikely except for mods21 - 2047 , whose @xmath102 is 0.999 . in order to check the third possibility",

    "we note that the luminosity ratio of the uv continuum to h@xmath3 varies with the population of a galaxy .",

    "we compare our result for sfr and stellar mass with the @xcite relation ( figure [ fig : sed_ms_comp ] ) . for the @xcite relation , significant fractions of sbzk galaxies ( 4/18 and 4/19 for sbzk - mips and sbzk - non - mips ,",
    "respectively ) deviate from the correlation .",
    "massive galaxies ( @xmath183 ) in our sample are distributed around the relation given by @xcite , while some of the less massive galaxies ( @xmath184 ) have much higher sfr than that expected from the correlation . even for the equal - extinction case , which makes the sfrs of the higher sfr galaxies lower ,",
    "there is still no correlation between stellar mass and sfr like that of @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for the discrepancy could be the different extinction estimates used in @xcite , who assumed a linear correlation between @xmath185 color and @xmath180 derived from their sed fitting result @xcite to estimate extinction - corrected uv luminosities .",
    "in fact , if we apply the @xmath180 values estimated from the @xmath185 color , the extinction corrected sfr(h@xmath3 ) becomes smaller than the @xmath180 values estimated from our stellar population analysis ( figure [ fig : sed_ms_bz ] ) .",
    "especially when the equal - extinction case is applied , the extinction corrected sfr(h@xmath3)s are similar to the @xcite relation . although our @xmath180 values correlate with @xmath185 color , the correlation has larger scatter than that of @xcite ( figure [ fig : ebv_bz ] ) .",
    "the high - ssfr galaxies have larger @xmath180 values than the galaxies with similar @xmath185 color .",
    "the @xcite relation is also supported by @xcite , who shows the averaged properties of extinction from the radio - to - uv luminosity ratio using a large numbers ( @xmath186 ) of sbzk galaxies .",
    "they also find a strong correlation between the stellar mass and the amount of extinction , and thus the correlation accentuates the @xcite relation . in figure",
    "[ fig : ms_ebv ] , the amount of extinction of our galaxies is shown as a function of the stellar mass .",
    "our results show a larger scatter than the errors of the correlation by @xcite . although the extinction values of the low - ssfr galaxies correlate with the stellar masses , consistent with that of @xcite , the high - ssfr galaxies have higher extinctions than the low - ssfr galaxies with similar stellar masses .",
    "because our emission line galaxies would be biased towards h@xmath3 bright systems , galaxies that deviate from the average relation shown by @xcite can be found , which probably results in the larger scatter .",
    "@xcite also shows the same correlation using a sfr indicator unrelated to extinction .",
    "they estimated the sfr from the sum of the extinction uncorrected uv and mid - ir luminosities .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite reported that there exist significant fraction of lower mass ( @xmath187 ) galaxies with high ssfrs ( @xmath188 ) at @xmath7 using sfr inferred from the 24@xmath2 m flux .",
    "@xcite argues that the correlation is not accurately recovered with sfrs inferred only from mid - ir , due to a substantial presence of mips - excess galaxies , which are excluded from their sample .",
    "a mips - excess galaxy could harbor a heavily obscured agn @xcite .",
    "however , our results on the sfr inferred from h@xmath3 do not recover the correlation even if mips - excess galaxies are excluded from the sample .",
    "we calculate the mips excesses of our sample following @xcite , and found that only a fraction of the high - ssfr galaxies show mips - excess . in figure",
    "[ fig : sed_ms_comp ] , mips - excess galaxies are denoted by white dots , which found to be more typically low - ssfr galaxies rather than high - ssfr galaxies .",
    "previous studies on the relation between sfr and stellar mass using the sfr derived from the h@xmath3 luminosity show a similar trend to ours .",
    "the sfrs and stellar masses of bm / bx galaxies @xcite and sbzk galaxies @xcite are also plotted on figure [ fig : sed_ms_comp ] .",
    "we convert the sfr and stellar mass of these studies to those calibrated with a @xcite imf . in the literature",
    ", they applied different extinction corrections to estimate the h@xmath3 luminosities from that used to estimate the stellar extinction .",
    "the equal - extinction case is applied to the bm / bx galaxies , while the @xcite relation to the sbzk galaxies . for comparison",
    ", we applied the same extinction correction to the samples in the literature as that for the present sample in each panel .",
    "there are no correlations between sfr and stellar mass of the samples in the both panels . however , some high - ssfr galaxies with ssfr@xmath188 appear when the @xcite relation is applied .    in the studies for bm / bx and sbzk galaxies ,",
    "validity of the extinction correction is confirmed with the consistency between sfr(h@xmath3 ) and sfr(uv ) @xcite .",
    "we also confirmed the consistency between them in the previous section . the extinction corrected sfr(h@xmath3 )",
    "values assuming the equal - extinction case are consistent only for lower sfr galaxies ( sfr@xmath189 ) .",
    "sfrs calculated assuming the @xcite relation are broadly consistent , but the sfr(h@xmath3)s are systematically larger than the sfr(uv)s by 0.3dex .",
    "these are almost consistent with the previous sfr(h@xmath3 ) works .",
    "although @xcite applied only the equal - extinction case , galaxies with sfr(uv ) @xmath190 are rare in their sample . on the other hand , @xcite , who used the @xcite relation , also showed that their sfr(h@xmath3 ) values are systematically larger than sfr(uv ) by a factor of 3 .",
    "recently , the relation between balmer decrement and stellar continuum attenuation has been investigated for galaxies at low - to - medium redshift .",
    "@xcite studied spectroscopically confirmed @xmath14-selected sample at @xmath191 .",
    "their extinctions from the balmer decrement and the continuum extinctions are equal on average . on the other hand , @xcite studied nearby galaxies , including starburst galaxies such as infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "comparison between their extinctions shows large scatter , but the average stellar - to - nebular extinction ratio is consistent with the @xcite relation .",
    "the dust properties of the samples in these two studies are quite different .",
    "for example , the median reddening of @xcite sample is @xmath192 , while about half of the galaxies of @xcite have @xmath193 .",
    "the values of reddening of the high - z samples discussed above and our samples are similar to that of @xcite , but vary with the sample selection .",
    "the median values of reddening are @xmath194 for bm / bx galaxies by @xcite and sbzk galaxies by @xcite , respectively .",
    "this can imply that the @xcite relation gives better estimation of the value of reddening for ionized gas in the active star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity reflects the past star - formation history of a galaxy since the heavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion in stars and fed back into gas .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the gas - phase metallicity of galaxies in the high - z universe is lower than that in the local universe .",
    "the metallicities were found to be lower in high - z galaxies than those in local galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we measured the gas - phase metallicity of our samples to investigate their star - formation histories .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity is estimated from the [ nii]@xmath626583-h@xmath3 line ratio ( n2 index ) , defined by @xmath195\\lambda 6583/\\mathrm{h\\alpha}\\}},\\ ] ] which correlates with oxygen abundance @xcite .",
    "the relation between the n2 index and gas - phase oxygen abundance is given by @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "[ nii ] and h@xmath3 are so close to each other in wavelength that the ratio is not affected by reddening .",
    "therefore , the n2 index has been used to estimate the oxygen abundances of distant galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the n2 index saturates at @xmath197 ( @xmath198 * ? ? ?",
    "in order to gain a sufficiently high s / n to reliably measure the line flux ratio , we stacked the [ nii]-h@xmath3 emission lines .",
    "we divided the present sample into three groups based on stellar masses at @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "in addition , we also divide the sample into two groups based on a ssfr of @xmath201 .",
    "the stacking , measurement of flux , and estimates of error are performed in the same manner as described in  [ subsec : stack ] .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig : mzr ] as a function of the median stellar mass of each group . for comparison , @xmath202 local objects from sdss dr4 , local lyman",
    "break analog ( lba ) galaxies @xcite , bm / bx galaxies @xcite , and sbzk galaxies @xcite are also plotted with the same calibration .",
    "the mass - metallicity properties of our high - ssfr galaxies are possibly different from that of rest - uv selected galaxies .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation of the two largest mass bins is consistent with that of bm / bx galaxies described by @xcite , while the smallest mass bin has higher metallicity than the similar mass bins of @xcite ; our sample is closer to the local galaxies .",
    "the discrepancy in the smallest mass bin could be due to the galaxies with high ssfr .",
    "the high - ssfr group has higher metallicity , close to that of the local galaxies with similar stellar mass .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sed_ms ] , high - ssfr galaxies dominate our sample in the smallest mass bin , while most of the galaxies in @xcite have ssfr smaller than @xmath201 .",
    "the @xmath14-band selected samples would provide many galaxies with high ssfr and metallicity .",
    "the existence of higher metallicity galaxies in @xmath14-selected sample is also supported by the observations of sbzk galaxies by @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : mzr ] . on the other hand , the local lbas , which are local analogs of high - z uv - selected galaxies , tend to have a lower mass - metallicity relation .",
    "this would suggest that the sample by @xcite is biased toward lower metallicities due to the rest - uv selection .",
    "the results indicate that in order to reveal the unbiased cosmic evolution of mass - metallicity relation , we need to evaluate metallicities of a larger sample of @xmath14-band selected ( i.e. , mass - selected ) galaxies .",
    "it is surprising that the high - ssfr galaxies have already acquired metallicities as high as local galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "the age of the stellar population of the high - ssfr galaxies is young , so that the metal enrichment must have occurred in a short timescale .",
    "the n2 index is known to be sensitive to a hard ionizing radiation field from an agn or strong shock excitation and ionization parameter @xcite .",
    "in fact , our stacked [ oiii]@xmath625007/h@xmath50 and [ nii]@xmath626583/h@xmath3 line ratios show evidence for a harder ionizing spectrum .",
    "if the metallicity is really high , the result is in conflict with the observations of local galaxies .",
    "these galaxies can not keep their stellar masses and metallicities after the observed epoch , because the studies for local galaxies demonstrate that galaxies in a similar mass range formed a significant fraction of their stars in the low redshift universe @xcite , suggesting that these local galaxies must have increased their metallicity recently .",
    "it is possible that such high - ssfr galaxies evolved into larger stellar mass galaxies with low star - forming efficiency in the local universe , depleting the gas and/or merging with higher mass galaxies .",
    "we estimate the contribution of the observed galaxies to the cosmic sfr density at @xmath7 with the sfr(h@xmath3)s , dividing the sample into two groups with ssfr @xmath188 and @xmath203 for the extinction corrected sfrs with the @xcite relation .",
    "since we observed only a limited number of sbzk galaxies , we need to assume that the sfr and redshift distributions of the other galaxies are the same as the observed galaxies ; this is not unreasonable since we randomly selected the present sample from the sbzk - mips and sbzk - non - mips population .",
    "first , we further divide the sample based on the mips detection in the public catalog .",
    "second , we calculated the total sfr in a certain group ; we multiply the total sfr in the group by the ratio of the number of the entire galaxies in the group to that of the number of galaxies observed . in the calculation of total sfr",
    ", we assumed that the sfr of the galaxies without h@xmath3 detection is negligible ; we set those sfrs to zero .",
    "then the total sfrs of galaxies with and without mips detection are summed .",
    "third , we divide the total sfr by the expected detection rate of h@xmath3 emission line ( 87.7% ; see  [ subsec : haemission ] ) to recover the h@xmath3 emission lines not detected due to strong sky emission lines or atmospheric absorption bands .",
    "finally , we divide the total sfrs by comoving volume of the survey region for @xmath204 .",
    "the resultant total cosmic sfr densities of the sbzk galaxies are @xmath205 , @xmath206 @xmath207 for extinction correction calculated using the @xcite relation and the equal - extinction case , respectively . as we see in the previous discussions , the relation between extinction estimated from the stellar continuum and the emission lines probably depend on the intrinsic luminosities , and thus the sfrs . to examine this effect ,",
    "when we apply extinction correction with the @xcite relation for the sbzk - mips galaxies and equal extinction for the sbzk - non - mips galaxies ( differential correction ) , the result is @xmath208 . in any case of the extinction correction ,",
    "high - ssfr galaxies have a large contribution to the sfr density .",
    "although these galaxies account for only @xmath209 of all of the galaxies , they contribute to @xmath210 of the sfr density for the extinction correction with the @xcite relation and the differential extinction . even for the equal - extinction case , they contribute to no less than @xmath211 of the sfr density .",
    "we compare our sfr density at @xmath7 with previous works ( e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we use the same calibration of imf as that of these studies , the sfr densities are 0.203 , 0.044 , 0.134@xmath212 for the @xcite relation , the equal - extinction case , and the differential correction , respectively . the values compiled by @xcite and @xcite",
    "are 0.05 - 0.38@xmath207 , which are consistent with both of those with the @xcite relation and differential extinction .",
    "recent studies on the sfr density at @xmath7 using ir luminosities ( 850@xmath2 m ; @xcite ; 24@xmath2 m ; @xcite ) show slightly lower sfr densities ( 0.08 - 0.09@xmath212 ) , which are still consistent with the differential extinction correction .",
    "this would also suggest that the relation between the dust properties of the stellar continuum and the emission lines are different depending on the intrinsic sfr .",
    "the sfr density using the equal - extinction case is lower than that of any study .",
    "the lower sfr density implies that applying the equal - extinction case to all galaxies underestimates sfr(h@xmath3 ) .",
    "we performed near - infrared spectroscopic observations for 37 @xmath0 color selected star - forming galaxies with moircs on the subaru telescope .",
    "the sample galaxies are picked from the deep @xmath1-selected catalog of mods .",
    "we select 18 of our sample from the publicly available 24@xmath2 m source catalog of mips on board the @xmath153 space telescope . in order to avoid contamination by agns",
    ", we exclude the bzks detected in the _ chandra _ deep field - north 2ms point - source catalogs .",
    "all of the sample galaxies have strong 1.6@xmath2 m bumps in their seds , so that their optical emission is thought to be dominated by the stellar continuum .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission lines are detected from 23 galaxies , of which the median redshift is @xmath213 . in the diagnostic diagram with [ oiii]@xmath625007/h@xmath50 and [ nii]@xmath626583/h@xmath3 ,",
    "the line ratios of the stacked spectra are above that found for local star - forming galaxies but closer to the expectations from star - formation activity rather than agn activity .",
    "we derived the sfrs from the extinction - corrected h@xmath3 luminosities .",
    "the extinction correction for the h@xmath3 luminosity is estimated from the sed fitting of multi - band photometric data with stellar population models of exponentially declining sfr and the @xcite extinction curve . to estimate the extinction correction for the ionized gas",
    ", we assumed the @xcite relation ( @xmath214 ) as well as the equal - extinction case @xmath215 , and compared the extinction corrected sfrs .",
    "although the balmer decrement of the stacked emission lines is consistent with the @xcite relation , a fraction of the h@xmath50 detected galaxies are consistent with the equal - extinction case .",
    "we further investigated these galaxies by comparing the extinction corrected h@xmath3 luminosities with other sfr indicators .",
    "the comparison with the uv and mips 24@xmath2 m flux shows that the sfrs of lower sfr galaxies ( @xmath216 ) are in good agreement for the equal - extinction case , while those of the higher sfr galaxies agree for the @xcite relation .",
    "this implies that the relation between the dust properties of the stellar continuum and emission lines are different depending on the intrinsic sfr ( differential extinction correction ) .",
    "if the calzetti relation is assumed , a fraction of the high - sfr galaxies should be detected in radio , ( sub-)mm , and x - ray catalogs , but none of them except one aztec source are detected .",
    "we could not explain the reason for this discrepancy consistently .",
    "however , most of the discrepancy could be explained by the short timescale of star - formation activity , because the younger ages of the stellar population are derived from our sed analysis .",
    "we note that other mechanisms ( e.g. , top - heavy imf , lower dust temperature , etc . )",
    "could also explain a part of the discrepancy .",
    "we compared the extinction - corrected h@xmath3 luminosities with the stellar masses obtained from the sed fitting .",

    "we also calculate the contribution of the present h@xmath3 emission to the cosmic sfr density at @xmath7 .",
    "our results are consistent with previous works , if we apply the @xcite relation or differential extinction correction .",
