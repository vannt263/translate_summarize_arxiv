    "the logistic equation    @xmath0    @xmath1 , is one of the most frequently used , and undoubtedly most successful , models of population dynamics .",
    "it is now one of the classical examples of self - organization in many natural and artificial systems @xcite .",
    "it is virtually impossible to list its all applications  for example , the web search returns more than 60000 links to pages and on - line publications containing the key words `` logistic equation '' .",
    "a natural generalization of the model is one in which the deterministic growth rate , @xmath2 , is perturbed by a stochastic process :    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is the stochastic term . such equation has been first discussed by leung @xcite and later by many other authors . in particular ,",
    "authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , by borel summing a formal series for the expectation value @xmath5 , obtained expressions for the nonlinear relaxation time .",
    "the noise term @xmath4 was represented by the gaussian white noise ( gwn ) in refs .",
    "@xcite and by a gaussian colored noise in ref .",
    "surprisingly , closed and mathematically exact expression for the expectation value and the variance of @xmath6 are still lacking ; we have not solved this problem , but we will present a  heuristics , based on a simple transformation of eq .   that , as our numerical simulations indicate , can be useful in predicting the behavior of systems described by the noisy logistic equation .    surprisingly , the problem of the noisy logistic equation is closely related to that of the linear stochastic resonance ( lsr ) .",
    "the stochastic resonance ( sr ) is an example of the constructive role of a noise , where the noise and a dynamical system act together to reinforce a periodic signal @xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . we should mention that an aperiodic stochastic resonance has also been discovered @xcite .",
    "the sr now seems to be ubiquitous and has been claimed `` an inherent property of rate - modulated series of events '' @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a long - standing debate whether the sr can be at all present in linear systems .",
    "this point is important because a  linear kinetics ( relaxation ) is the final stage of most dissipative processes",
    ". it would be particularly important to establish the existence of a lsr in systems driven by a gwn because such a noise represents the standard equilibrium fluctuations of macroscopic physical systems .",
    "the lsr has been first reported by fuliski in ref .",
    "@xcite an later discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , it was soon pointed out that the lsr vanished in the gwn limit @xcite or after averaging over the initial phase of the signal @xcite , or was restricted to transient times , even though other constructive effects of the noise persisted in the asymptotic regime as well @xcite .",
    "short - lived or phase - dependent phenomena can not be deemed `` unphysical ''  on the contrary , they may be very important in many situations , for example in enzymatic reactions in living cells  but there is a general consensus that a fully - fledged stochastic resonance should be characterized by a clear maximum of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) which survives the phase averaging and persists for long times , indicating the presence of an optimal noise level .",
    "the first evidence for a lsr that displays a maximum of the snr was given only recently in ref .",
    "however , we have shown @xcite that this particular case of the sr was of a non - dynamical nature as the output of the dynamical system discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite merely reproduced the spectral properties of the input signal , and moreover , the resonant properties of the latter were only an artifact of the chosen parameterization of the noises . in the present paper",
    "we show analytically that a simple linear system with correlated multiplicative and additive gwns and a driving that consists of a constant term and a periodic signal displays a maximum of the snr that lacks all the above - mentioned deficiencies : the maximum is present in the asymptotic ( long time ) regime and not only for transient times , it survives averaging over the initial phase of the signal , and finally , it is a result of a  collective action of the system , the noises and the external driving and not merely a reproduction of very particular properties of the input sequence .",
    "assume that the noise term in the perturbed logistic equation is a  gwn with @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the equation can easily be solved for every specific realization of the noise . the formal solution to eq .   then reads    @xmath9}\\,.\\ ] ]    in most practical situations ,",
    "one is interested not in specific realizations of a stochastic process , but rather in moments of that process , averaged over an ensemble .",
    "one is tempted , then , to calculate the moments directly from eq .  , expanding it in a power series :    @xmath10 \\right)^n \\right\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^\\infty(-1)^n \\left(\\frac{1-x_0}{x_0}\\right)^n e^{-nat } \\left\\langle \\exp\\left[-np\\,\\int\\limits_0^t\\xi(t^\\prime)dt^\\prime\\right ] \\right\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^\\infty(-1)^n \\left(\\frac{1-x_0}{x_0}\\right)^n e^{-nat } \\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{2}n^2p^2t\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 stands for an average over the realizations of the noise @xmath4 .",
    "we have changed the order of the summation and taking the average in eq .   and used the well known fact that for a gwn    @xmath12\\right\\rangle= \\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\left(f(t^\\prime)\\right)^2dt^\\prime\\right].\\ ] ]    we can , however , see that the final series in eq",
    ".   is clearly divergent and even though a series similar to it has been borel summed and some useful information has been extracted from it @xcite , we conclude that the formal solution given by eq .   offers little insight into the properties of eq .  .",

    "this observation does not constitute a  _ proof _ that analogous statements can be made about the logistic process @xmath6 , too , but provides a useful heuristics about the long - time properties of the logistic process .",
    "the substitution gives also a possibility of a further generalization of the noisy logistic equation that will be pursued in the next section .",
    "with the substitution eq .   changes into    @xmath16    note that this substitution does not affect the stable stationary point @xmath17 of eq .   and its basin of attraction ,",
    "but it breaks for the unstable stationary point @xmath18 of eq .  .",
    "therefore , the vicinity of the unstable stationary point may not be represented correctly by the transformation .",
    "the equation closely resembles the equation of motion of a linear transmitter with multiplicative and additive noises that has been the subject of our recent research @xcite ; the principal difference is that the constant additive driving was lacking in models discussed there .",
    "the equation   can easily be generalized    @xmath19    where both noises @xmath20 , @xmath21 are gwns , but they are correlated : @xmath22 .",
