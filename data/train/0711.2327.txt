    "many models show this measurement is a useful probe of circumstellar environments at small spatial scales .",

    "these signatures can directly constrain the density and geometry of the circumstellar material and probe the near - star environment .",
    "typical spectropolarimetric signals are small , often a few tenths of a percent change in polarization across a spectral line .",
    "measuring these signals requires very high signal to noise observations and careful control of systematics to measure signals at the 0.1% level .",
    "this technique probes small spatial scales , typically being sensitive to the region within 10 stellar radii . even for the closest young stars ( 150pc ) ,",
    "these spatial scales are smaller than 0.1 milliarcseconds across and will not be imaged directly , even by 100 m telescopes .",
    "since the circumstellar material is involved in accretion , outflows , winds and disks , with many of these phenomena happening simultaneously , spectropolarimetry can put unique constraints on the types of densities and geometries of the material involved in these processes .    in order to address these issues , we built a spectropolarimeter for the hivis spectrograph on the 3.7 m aeos telescope and performed a preliminary telescope polarization calibration ( thornton 2002 , thornton et al .",
    "2003 , harrington et al .",
    "since then , we have made many improvements .",
    "we have upgraded much of the hardware , calibrations , and reduction package .",
    "a large number of stellar observations have been partially reported in harrington & kuhn 2007 to illustrate the capability of the spectropolarimeter .",
    "we present the reduction package , polarization calibrations , and implications of these calibrations for stellar observations with this instrument .",
    "we have done several upgrades to the instrument recently .",
    "the polarimeter has been remounted with better alignment and less vignetting .",
    "a new tip - tilt guiding corrector has been installed and calibrated .",
    "a hard - mounted , adjustable dekkar and polarization calibration mount have been installed and allow for quick , easy , and repeatable calibration and adjustment .",
    "the failed ccd - id20 s were replaced with a similar copy , but an unresolved hardware / rfi issue caused this repair to fail .",
    "the original science camera failed and has been replaced by a new commercial 1k@xmath1 pixis camera and is working wonderfully .",
    "the calibration stage had lenses mounted that increased the flat - field flux by a factor of 6 and the thar lamp flux by a factor of 150 .",
    "these improvements greatly increase the ease and accuracy of spectral calibration .",
    "the spectropolarimetric reduction pipeline can be broken into a few basic parts .",

    "2 ) setting up the coordinate grids as x - pixel , y - pixel , slit - tilt and wavelength calibration .",
    "3 ) calculating a first - pass spectrum by simply averaging all pixels at a given wavelength .",
    "4 ) calculating more spectra based on optimal - extraction routines , with cosmic ray rejection and flux - weighting .",
    "5 ) doing the polarization calculations and 6 ) simulating and quantifying the systematic errors .",
    "the first step is trivial - a clipped mean is performed on a number of flats to produce a flat field .",
    "since we are doing high s / n measurements , we found that we needed a minimum of 20 flats at 10000 adu to get good s / n .",
    "we decided to do the dark and bias calibration in a less - than - traditional way because of a slowly - fluctuating , non - repeatable background level , which is quite common with most detectors .",
    "we had an overscan region in the original science detector with the ccd - id20 s which allowed us to track the changing dark levels throughout the night .",
    "the replacement pixis 1024br array was smaller than the focal plane and is always exposed to light .",
    "both the original lincoln labs ccd - id20 s and the pixis detector showed a significant ( @xmath2few% ) drift in the bias levels throughout a night .",
    "the pixis camera had no overscan region , but the median values of all the darks taken over many months did show variation in the overall background levels .",
    "these variations with this instrumental setup and background levels required a background subtraction from each frame using the unexposed pixels outside the echelle orders as this directly tracked the background levels of the chip and reduced the systematic uncertainties . for our short exposures ,",
    "the dark current was small , and is automatically corrected with the frame - by - frame background subtraction .",
    "since the instrumental setup and the order locations on the ccd s has changed much over the last few years , and changed quite often during the instrument work done in the fall of 2006 , setting up the coordinate grid requires more user - input than most dedicated reduction scripts .",
    "the user must supply a guess at the polarized order locations , typically 5 points to fit a 3rd - order polynomial , and a bright stellar image taken that night to serve as a template for the curvature of the orders .",
    "figure [ fig : coord ] shows a bright standard with the narrow h@xmath3 line near the center of the 1k@xmath1 array .",
    "the code sets up an initial polynomial fit to these user - input points , and then takes spatial ( vertical ) cuts at each spectral ( horizontal ) pixel .",
    "each of these spatial cuts are then fit by a gaussian to determine a robust location of the peak intensity in the spatial direction across the ccd , reducing the influence of cosmic rays or chip defects .",
    "these peak intensity positions allow for a robust fit to the order shape on the ccd with a slope of around 5% ( crossing a spatial pixel every 18 or 20 spectral pixels ) .",
    "the orders are fit independently and the shapes are the same to the 0.1 pixel level ( @xmath40.2% of an order width ) .",
    "the order separation , caused by the savart plate , is then calculated as the median difference between the two polynomial fits .",
    "for the pixis camera , this was 58 - 59 pixels .",
    "the residuals between the calculated peak intensity and the polynomial fits are typically under half a pixel and show the expected oscillation with wavelength as spatial pixels are crossed .",
    "the star observed for the template is never completely centered in the slit from small guiding errors .",
    "once we have these order shapes from the stellar observations , we then must adjust these polynomials to reflect the true slit center .",
    "this is done with the flat - field .",
    "first we create an average spatial profile ( slit illumination pattern ) for the flat field , centered on the stellar template by simply averaging the flat field along the order template in the spectral direction .",
    "these spatial profiles , shown in figure [ fig : flatslice ] clearly show the slit boundaries , where the flat field intensity falls off sharply .",
    "the flat - field spatial cuts are cross - correlated to find the offsets from the stellar order - shape polynomial fits to the center of the flat - field spatial cuts .",
    "once the offset from the stellar template to the flat - field region is calculated , the full coordinate grid can be computed with the order centers , edges , and background locations specified .",
    "once the coordinate grid is set , we can then make a calibrated flat field , adjusting for the blaze function , and wavelength dependence of the flat - field lamp ( blackbody ) .",
    "a flat - field is supposed to correct for pixel - to - pixel gain and field - dependent efficiencies only .",
    "the flat - field values should not introduce any blaze , lamp or spatial illumination dependencies .",
    "this means that the flat - field must be corrected for it s inherent spatial and spectral structure . to correct the flat field spectral dependence ( horizontal ) ,",
    "a simple flat - field spectrum is made for each polarized order by averaging all pixels spatially at a given spectral position .",
    "this spectrum has a bit of intrinsic noise in it so a low - order polynomial fit is made .",
    "the flat - field image then has this spectral dependence removed .",
    "the spatial structure is corrected by dividing each spatial cut along the flat - field spectrum by the average spatial profile , removing the spatial dependence of the flat ( inhomogeneous slit illumination ) at each wavelength .",
    "this makes our flat - field much closer to a true pixel - to - pixel gain measurement , shown in figure [ fig : calibratedflat ] .      with the recent calibration - stage improvements we have implemented , it became possible to do very accurate wavelength calibration using low order polynomial fits to at least six clear , unblended lines , just over the h@xmath3 spectral region . with a @xmath2600x increase in thar flux ( 15x without the diffuser - bypass mirror )",
    ", we can use the smallest slit ( 0.35 \" ) at highest resolution ( r=49000 ) to clearly identify lines and compare the lines with standard line - lists obtained from the noao spectral atlas .",
    "the new hivis detector has a wavelength scale of 0.037@xmath5 per pixel ( 1.7 km / sec per pixel at h@xmath3 ) .",
    "thus the rotation of the earth produces a @xmath6 pixel shift and seasonal variations can approach 40 pixels .",
    "the wavelength calibration is done in a two - step process . a th - ar spectrum taken with the 0.35 `` slit",
    "is used to identify the lines .",
    "the th - ar spectra are calculated with the simple average over all illuminated pixels .",
    "the unblended lines are identified and the peaks are fit by a gaussian to determine the line centers .",
    "a 3@xmath7 order polyomial fit to the line centers is used to create a wavelength array .",
    "the noao atlas spectrum , hivis spectrum , and a comparison ab - auriga spectrum are shown in figure [ fig : thar - fit ] .",
    "the triangles mark the 6 lines used in the polynomial fits .",
    "since all stellar observations were done with the 1.5 '' slit , a 4-orientation sequence of thar spectra are taken with this slit and then reduced with the simple - average method .",
    "the resulting lower - resolution spectrum is cross - correlated with the higher - resolution spectra produced by the 0.35 \" slit to determine any shifts between slits and waveplate orientations , the beam wander or wobble , which is a small fraction of a pixel .",
    "the average slit tilt is then calculated to modify the coordinate - grid for the reduction program .",
    "the tilt is a spectral - direction shift of @xmath47 pixels between the bottom and top of each order ( across the 50 pixel slit width ) .",
    "this shift is calculated as a cross - correlation of a spectral cut beween each spatial position along the order .",
    "this tilt is then implemented as a integer - pixel shift of the coordinate grid at each spatial point .",
    "there is a very significant increase in resolution when the tilted - coordinates are used .",
    "figure [ fig : thar - align ] shows the spectral cuts before and after alignment , as well as the intensity of the line calculated with both tilted and un - tilted coordinate grids .",
    "the spectral resolution derived from the th - ar line fits goes from r=30000 to r=49000 when using tilted coordinates .",
    "once the tilted coordinate grid , gain - table , and wavelength calibration is done , the data can be processed .",
    "each exposure is divided by the gain - table ( calibrated flat ) .",
    "a background spectrum is made by averaging the unexposed background region outside the polarized orders .",
    "this background is noisy and so a linear fit to this background is subtracted from each order to remove the dark current and bias of the detector .    to create a simple",
    ", first - pass at the spectrum , every pixel at each wavelength was simply averaged to compute the intensity .",
    "at the same time , an average spatial profile ( psf ) is constructed by averaging all these spatial cuts spectrally .",
    "while this method does not correct for cosmic rays , and does not weight the pixels by their fractional - stellar - flux or psf , this simple average spectrum provides a starting point for more sophisticated reductions .      in many parts of the reduction package , we want to shift and scale one curve to another .",
    "we have developed a least - squares routine that allows us to calculate the shift and scaling coefficient between two input curves .",
    "the routine assumes that the scale and shift from one curve to another can be written in terms of the input curve and it s derivative . to illustrate the routine",
    "we will show a shift - n - scale between the two polarized spectra , @xmath8 shifted and scaled to @xmath9 , as below :",
    "@xmath10    i is the intensity as a function of ccd pixel x , a is the relative gain between the two orthoganally polarized spectra , usually @xmath41 , and b is the spectral shift in pixels , usually @xmath110.8 pixels .",
    "the spectrum @xmath12 can be expanded to first order as below :",
    "@xmath13    rewriting the constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 and bringing all terms to one side gives the difference between the spectra @xmath9 and @xmath8 scaled and shifted by a and b. the least squares routine minimizes the function below for all pixels ( x ) :    @xmath16        the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 are then used to calculate the scaled and shifted functions .",
    "an example of this routine applied to a spectrum of ab aurigae is shown in figure [ fig : shfscl ] .",
    "a single spectrum was replicated and shifted by one pixel and corrected by the shift - n - scale routine .",
    "the routine uses a smoothed profile to calculate the derivative .",
    "this illustrates how a misalignment of the savart plate , simulated as a spectral shift of 1 pixel between the orthogonally polarized spectra , produces a fractional difference of order 5% from this misalignment .",
    "this signature is a systematic error that follows the derivative of the spectral line .",
    "the scale and shift operation minimizes this derivative signal as shown ( amplified ) in the bottom line in the plot .",
    "the residual noise is at the level of 0.2% and has some residual systematic error in it from the smoothing used to calculate the derivative , but the derivative - based error has been attenuated by a factor of about 20 .",
    "the shift - n - scale routine also has some nonlinearity to it , and is best used for pixel shifts @xmath190.8 pixels .",
    "when shift - n - scaling the original curve to the simulated one , the routine reproduced the shifts to better than 0.05% for spectral shifts of 5 pixels , far greater than the range needed .",
    "however , when shift - n - scaling the simulated curves to the original curve , the calculated shifts had an error of @xmath20.1 pixels for spectral shifts @xmath20.8 pixels .",
    "this sets the useful range of this routine .",
    "this first - pass spectrum and average spatial profile are projected back on the original spatial cuts with the shift - n - scale routine .",
    "the expected noise at each spatial pixel is found ( using estimates of the gain and read - noise ) .",
    "the standard deviation of each spatial pixel at each wavelength is then calculated and used to find any cosmic - ray hits as cosmic - rays ( and chip defects ) which will be strong devations ( @xmath20 ) from the spatial profile .",
    "an example of this cosmic ray removal routine is shown in figure [ fig : cosray ] .",
    "the average spatial profile is the dashed line .",
    "the spatial cut at this wavelength shows a few pixels deviating strongly from the average spatial profile from a cosmic ray hit .",
    "these pixels are identified and replaced with the shifted - and - scaled spatial profile , greatly reducing the error in the spectrum .",
    "once this cosmic ray removal routine is done , a spectrum is calculated as the simple average of all the pixels .",
    "the corrected spatial cuts are passed on to more optimal spectral extraction routines .",
    "the first of the optimal extraction routines uses the shift - and - scale routine to fit the average spatial profile ( psf ) to each of the individual spatial cuts at each wavelength .",
    "this reduction process assumes that the spatial profile does not vary across the order , an assumption that all optimal reduction packages adopt ( horne 1986 , marsh 1989 , donati et al .",
    "1997 , cushing et al .",
    "the calculated error in the shifts between the optional fit and the calculated order location is dependent on the flux , but is typically less than 0.1 pixels .",
    "another set of spectra are calculated as simple gaussian fits to the spatial cuts . while the psf ( spatial cut ) is not entirely gaussian , and certain seeing conditions or tracking - errors lead to not - quite - gaussian spatial cuts ( psf s ) , the fits are usually robust , and match the shift - n - scale and simple - average specta well .",
    "the standard gaussfit routine is applied to each spatial cut , with the initial estimates for the gaussian as : peak intensity is twice the computed average - spectra , centered on the order , with a fwhm of one - quarter the order width and zero background .",
    "the routine works well when the spatial cuts ( psf s ) are roughly gaussian .",
    "thus , we have three spectra with different systematic effects ( simple - average , shift - n - scale , gaussian - fit ) - which are all included in the polarization analysis to probe our polarimetric reduction codes and systematic errors inherent in these reductions . in practice ,",
    "the exact choice of reduction parameters is unimportant .",
    "figure [ fig : difred ] shows the simple - average method with and without a flat field or tilted coordinates , and varying order widths from 43 to 49 pixels ( covering the edges of the illuminated region , see figure [ fig : flatslice ] ) .",
    "the tilted coordinates do add a significant increase in resolution , but for the high signal - to - noise spectropolarimetric observations the spectra are rebinned to lower resolution anyways .",
    "the flat field does increase the signal - to - noise of the intensity calculation , but as we show below , the basic polarization calculations are independent of the flat field .",
    "the aeos telescope is designed for military applications and does not have a standard siderial guiding telescope .",
    "there are significant tracking errors that can accumulate and there are offsets induced by manual telescope - operator corrections .",
    "the operation requirements set out by the afrl require that we have no control over the guiding , and that their operators control the pointing of the telescope .",
    "there are a number of data set s where an operator s manual steps caused a non - gaussian spatial profile .",
    "thus we calculate the spectra using all three methods , but the averaging and shift - n - scaling are most robust .",
    "these three different reductions vary slightly between each other .",
    "the gaussian - fit and simple - average methods vary by only a few parts - per - million when the spatial cuts ( psf s ) are gaussian . however , the shift - n - scale method and the simple - average methods vary slightly across the line profile , giving an overall uncertainty in the shape of the intensity profile . however , the spectropolarimetry is calculated as the difference between line profiles on the same image .",
    "since the same reduction method is applied to each polarized order in the same way for each polarization measurement , it is only any differential error that would cause systematic errors in the spectropolarimetry .",
    "the reduction package uses all three calculation methods to assess the systematic errors that might be present in each method , or in the subsequent processing of the spectra .",
    "our focus is on spectral and spectropolarimetric variability . with the many instrumental polarization effects , we must do continuum - polarization subtraction to isolate the change across the line profile . since spectral variability is always referenced to continuum",
    ", no spectrophotometric or flux calibration is done , though standards are observed for future work .",
    "the continuum is simply subtracted as a linear fit to the intensity on either side of the spectral line .",
    "this continuum subtraction normalizes the slope of the black - body of the star , removes the instrumental continuum polarization signals , and removes the instrumental blaze efficiency .",
    "continuum subtraction is done by averaging 20 pixels sufficiently far enough away from chip edges .",
    "we found that there is a variable dark signal that curves the echelle orders near the edge of the chip , 10 - 20 pixels wide , in a non - repeatable way , so this region is avoided .",
    "cirrus , tracking errors , and wind - bounce all influence the throughput of the spectrograph and thus , even on a spectrophotometric night , a significant variation in the continuum flux is sometimes seen .    the data taken before 10 - 27 - 2006 was imaged using an echelle order which placed the h@xmath3 line near the edge of the chip .",
    "this placement was done before we did some instrumental corrections , and before we remounted the pixis camera to a different region of the focal plane . in the more recent data , h@xmath3 is closer to the blaze - efficiency peak and is much closer to the center of the focal plane .",
    "the continuum fits to the ccd - id20 images were not as accurate because the red wings of the h@xmath3 line were near the order edge , giving rise to a small ( @xmath41% ) error in slope estimate .",
    "however , this uncertainty is negligable for data taken on each night because the continuum is calculated in the same way for each instrumental setup on each night .",
    "this only produces an uncertainty in the night - to - night variability of the line profiles , and in the overall slope of the calculated continuum and continuum polarization .      at this point",
    "it is useful to demonstrate the coordinate grid and basic properties of the reduction package by demonstrating the wavelength dependence of the point - spread function properties .",
    "several authors have argued that the change in centroid location ( brightness peak ) or full - width at half - max ( fwhm ) can be used as evidence for binarity in a set of spectroastrometric calculations ( beckers 1982 , bailey 1998 , baines et al .",
    "spectroastrometry in principle is a technique that can detect unresolved binaries as a change in spatial profile width ( psf ) and location ( centroid ) across an emission or absorption line where the relative brightness of the two binary components significantly varies across the line .",
    "for example , if one star has an emission line and the other an absorption line , the centroid will shift towards the emitter in the core of the emission line .",
    "if the binary is significantly wide and bright , the fwhm would also decrease across the line as the relative contribution to the psf from the wide companion is reduced .",
    "this method makes use of the assumption that the psf across a line or spectral order does not change much , and that any significant change can be attributed to the source .",
    "hivis has been used to observe a number of young or emission - line stars as part of a large survey ( harrington & kuhn 2007 ) all of which have strong h@xmath3 lines .",
    "given the reported detections , we will present the feasibility and capability of hivis to do similar work .",
    "binaries are common among pre - main - sequence stars and this technique can easily be applied to every data set taken with this instrument .",
    "it also provides a good check on any systematic errors such as order mis - fitting or psf mis - fitting since any systematic error will show up with this measurement technique .",
    "since the centroid of a spatial profile on most spectrographs can be calculated to a fraction of a pixel accurately in high signal - to - noise data , this technique has the capability to detect binarity to less than 30mas separations or a third of a pixel when our pixels are 130mas ( cf .",
    "bailey 1998 , baines et al .",
    "normally , with a long - slit spectrograph , the slit of the instrument is rotated to a north - south line and an east - west line to fully sample the spatial changes .",
    "this allows one to establish the position - angle of the binary system . for polarimetric reasons expanded below",
    ", we do not use the image rotator and keep this component fixed vertically during our observations .",
    "this means that the position - angle rotates from exposure to exposure , but presenting the calculations is still useful to demonstrate the capability of the analysis software .            for each spectrum ,",
    "the optimal spectral extraction algorithms fit gaussians and average spatial profiles ( psf s ) to the data at each wavelength , as was shown in figure [ fig : cosray ] .",
    "these spatial profiles can easily be compared with the nominal values for the average spatial profile s fwhm and centroid for each order . at each wavelength , a deviation for the fwhm and the centroid can be calculated .",
    "because of small guiding errors , the centroid of each stellar observation does not coincide with the exact order center .",
    "because of the tilt of the orders on the detector , this will cause the centroid of the spectrum to cross spatial pixels at different spectral pixel locations . in order to correct for this ,",
    "our analysis package does a cross - correlation between the nominal order center location , as illustrated by the jig - saw shaped fit in figure [ fig : coord ] , and the centroid location of the actual observed spectrum .",
    "once this small offset has been corrected , the centroid location and the fwhm across the order is calculated .",
    "we will discuss some sample calculations from data taken the 20@xmath21 of september , 2007 below",

    "2006 , the known binary mwc 166 was reported to have a centroid shift of roughly 40mas ew and 15mas nw with corresponding fwhm changes of 40mas and 5mas respectively .",
    "this is tabulated in their paper as a total shift of 50mas at a pa of 287@xmath22 where the known separation of the binary is 0.65 `` at a pa of 298@xmath22 .",
    "figure [ fig : specast - mwc166 ] shows a hivis observation of this star .",
    "the observations had a peak of 1500adu and a continuum of 800 - 1300adu across the order and a fwhm of 11.7 pixels ( 1.5 '' ) .",
    "the deviation we detect in fwhm and centroid offset are both around 40mas , both the correct magnitude for this system .",
    "we also present observations of @xmath23 cassiopeia in figure [ fig : specast - gmcas ] at the same scale as mwc 166 to show a non - detection across a strong line .",
    "the peak intensity was near 26000adu with continuum from 4000 - 6000adu and a fwhm of 10.1 pixels ( 1.3 \" ) .",
    "this non - detection shows that spurious signatures caused from the 1% savart plate leak , non - linearity in the chip , spatial dependence of the focus or any other effects are not present across an emission line .",
    "the star p - cygni has a very strong h@xmath3 line .",
    "we observed this star with two different exposure times separated by 90 minutes .",
    "the reduction was performed with three separate settings : a width of 47 for tilted and untilted coordinates , as well as a width of 41 un - tilted .",
    "this will be used to highlight changes in derived psf properties when including tilts and neglecting low - flux psf wings .",
    "the altitude changed from 50@xmath22 to 34@xmath22 and the frame rotated by 28@xmath22 between the observations .",
    "the line has a normalized intensity of 0.194 in the absorption trough and 18.180 in the emission peak , or a flux ratio of 94 .",
    "this huge range in flux and the difference in seeing serves to highlight systematics .",
    "one exposure is deliberately clipped ( near saturated ) to illustrate systematic errors that can occur with this technique .",
    "the spatial profiles are shown in figure [ fig : specast - pcyg - psf ] .",
    "the peak intensity of the saturated exposure was 44000adu with continuum of 1800 - 3800adu and only 400adu in the absorptive component of the line .",
    "the calculated fwhm was 9.6 pixels ( 1.25 `` ) .",
    "however , a gaussian fit to the unsaturated region shows that the true peak should have been closer to 48000adu , or a roughly 10% clipping . the unsaturatd exposure taken an hour and a half later and at higher airmass had considerably less flux , 16000adu peak , continuum of 600 - 1100adu , and only 130adu in the absorptive component of the line .",
    "the calculated fwhm was 14.1 pixels ( 1.83 '' ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the psf properties shows striking changes across the line , shown in figure [ fig : specast - pcyg ] .",
    "both exposures and all reductions show a similar change in centroid location , sharply changing by about 50 - 150mas in the blue side of the absorptive component , then rapidly dropping across the center of the absorptive component to -20mas to -80mas in the red side of the absorption .",
    "the centroid then gradually rises over the emission to a peak of 5 - 15mas just before the emission line returns to continuum on the red side of the line .",
    "the change is actually greater in magnitude for the unsaturated exposure with any reduction parameters .",
    "there are actually six curves in the top panel of figure [ fig : specast - pcyg ] but the difference between order widths of 41 and 47 is completely negligible .",
    "the tilted coordinates show systematically lower deviations for both saturated and unsaturated exposures .",
    "in essence , more flux gives less deviation presumably from better fits .",
    "the tilted coordinates more accurately reflects the true wavelength dependence of the orders and reduces the systematic error .",
    "the fwhm also shows strong differences between the different exposures and reduction parameters .",
    "the unsaturated exposure with only 140adu peak flux shows a 200mas decrease in fwhm in the absorptive component of the line in both tilted and untilted coordinates with a width of 47 pixels .",
    "when the wings of the psf are neglected by using a width of 41 , the calculated fwhm deviations are significantly smaller , near 75mas , presumably because the wings of the psf have a noise contribution .",
    "this again shows that more flux leads to better fits and that large flux differences across a line lead to systematic effects .",
    "the saturated exposure shows an extra 50mas increase in fwhm across the emission peak in the clipped region of the line for all reductions .",
    "another complication is extended emission .",
    "a change in fwhm and centroid can be caused by significant resolved emission around an object , such as our observations of t ori .",
    "if there is no inspection of the raw data , this emission may be falsely reported as a binary detection .",
    "also - one can not rule out the possibility of unresolved nebulosity as a significant contribution to the psf .",
    "the observations of t ori showed a peak signal of 600adu with a continuum of 100 - 150adu .",

    "the centroid shift is small , roughly 40mas and is independent of the order tilt .",
    "the fwhm changes by roughly @xmath2480mas when using untilted coordinates , but is essentially zero when using tilted coordinates .",

    "we wish to note that no instrumental polalarization ripple of the kind mentioned in aitken & hough 2001 or seen in isis ( harries et al .",
    "1996 ) has been seen in our data .",
    "this ripple is thought to arise from fabry - perot type fringes in the wave - plate .",
    "though our instrument uses a standard achromatic waveplate , a thin layer of polymer sandwiched between two glass substrates , no ripple near the 0.1% level has been seen .",
    "the savart plate axis can never be perfectly aligned with the slit .",
    "this produces a small shift in the dispersion direction between the two polarized orders .",
    "this shift was calculated by cross - correlating the thar spectra from the two polarized orders .",
    "the derived shifts were 2 pixels in 2004 , 12 pixels in 2005 before the savart plate reinstallation , and 7 pixels after the 2006 remounting .",
    "to characterize any derivative noise , there are a number of ways we can align the spectra and calculate the polarization .",
    "the three ways are 1 ) no alignment 2 ) cross - correlation an a simple integer - pixel shift ( which preserves noise properties ) and 3 ) integer - pixel shift followed by the shift - n - scale sub - pixel alignment .",
    "when no alignment is done , the spectra and polarization are simply calculated where the are on the detector . in the integer - pixel - shift alignment",
    ", we do a cross - correlation on the spectra to ensure that the spectra aligned to a single pixel , as a double - check on the wavelength calibration .",
    "since any interpolation can effect and corrupt the noise statistics of the spectra , as shown by the shift - n - scale example in figure [ fig : shfscl ] , subpixel alignment must minimize the derivative signal more than it introduces extra noise . to evaluate all three alignments ,",
    "the polarization analysis is done on the three different spectra using the three different alignment methods .",
    "these nine polarization spectra are similar in their overall structure .",
    "a sample of this is shown in figure [ fig : q9ways ] .",
    "the polarization signature is around 1.5% and the differences between the different methods are very small .        the spectral shift ( beam wobble ) measured from th - ar lamp spectra taken at many waveplate orientations shows that there is a one pixel shift induced over a complete rotation of the waveplate with a roughly sinusoidal shape .",
    "the alignment of the waveplate with the savart plate causes a rotational offset between the rotation - stage zero point and the waveplate zero point of 85@xmath22 .",
    "this means we operate our waveplate from rotation angles of 85@xmath22 to 152.5@xmath22 near the crest of the sine - curve .",
    "measurements of thar spectra taken each night , shown in figure [ fig : wobble - exp ] , show that the beam wobble is roughly 0.3 pixels between the four waveplate orientations .",
    "the derivative signal caused by a 0.3 pixel shift for strong emission lines with contrast of 5 - 20 is roughly 1 - 3% .",
    "it will be shown later that the derivative signal subtracts away in the dual - beam polarization analysis and that a beam wobble of 0.3 pixels produces a negligible error .",
    "this beam - wobble signal follows regions of curvature and is proportional to the initial derivative error , as it is a derivative - of - derivative error ( acceleration ) .",
    "we also calculated the sub - pixel shifts between the three different intensity calculation methods using the shift - n - scale routine .",
    "we found the shifts to be a small fraction of a pixel .",
    "the wavelength of each pixel for each horizontal order is assigned by a 3@xmath7 order polynomial fit to thorium - argon calibration lamp images .",
    "this analysis is done independently on each order for the two orthogonal polarization states . typically , reduction packages , such as libre esprit for the espadons spectrograph on cfht ( donati et al .",
    "1997 ) use the wavelength fits as the alignment method between the polarized orders .",
    "we have found that the simple average without alignment method works best because the flat - field cancels in the polarization calculation , leaving the measurement independent of the pixel - to - pixel gain .      since hivis uses the alt - az coud focus , the spectropolarimeter s q - u reference frame rotates on the sky as the telescope tracks .",
    "there are two main rotations : one with altitude , between the tertiary mirror and m4 , as the altitude changes , the other with azimuth , between m6 and the coud pickoff mirror .",
    "normally , coud spectrographs use a 3-mirror image rotator somewhere downstream ( in an pupil plane ) to compensate for the telescope s motion and keep the orientation of the slit on the sky fixed .",
    "we have an image rotator , but since the rotator is 3 oblique reflections , we do not use this rotator to increase the accuracy of the polarimetric calibration of the instrument . changing the mirror orientations would change the polarization induced by the mirrors .",
    "the orientation of the instrument on the sky is allowed to rotate and exposures are kept short so that the rotation is small .",
    "the analysis software takes the date and time of the exposure and calculates the altitude and azimuth of the telescope during the exposure .",
    "knowing the orientation of the telescope mirrors , we can reconstruct the projection of the spectropolarimeter s q and u axes on the sky , and rotate all measurements to a common frame .",
    "a common convention is to set + q to north on the sky .",
    "the rotation angle between the 4 individual exposures in each set is calculated as position - angle + altitude - azimuth and is checked to quantify the inter - set smear .",
    "very large rotation angles occured when an object is tracked near transit ( high azimuth rates ) . for measurements with small rotations ,",
    "the polarization measurements are assumed to be accurate and are rotated to an absolute frame ( of the first exposure ) on the sky .    for every data",
    "set , rotation in an individual exposure causes each exposure to become a mix of stokes q and u , reducing the efficiency of the measurement and adding some uncertainty to the stokes parameters .",
    "imagine an incident + q beam .",
    "a rotation of the instrument of 22.5@xmath22 during an exposure would cause the projected instrument frame to go from + q to + u and the resulting measurement would only show 50% polarization , when 100% was incident .",
    "rotation between sets also induces systematic error .",
    "as the instrument rotates on the sky , different amounts of time will be spent sampling the polarization states . as an extreme example",
    ", 22.5@xmath22 rotation of the instrument between each individual exposure would cause all images to be oriented on the sky with + q whereas the reduction package would assume the sequence was + q , + u , -q , -u .",
    "the systematic error with this high rotation rate causes complete loss of information about u while doubling the time spent measuring q. it also causes the benefits of beam - swaping to be lost entirely and it causes the reduction methods to fail .",
    "since the expected spectropolarimetric signals are subtle differences in the polarized line profile shapes of less than one percent , and the few reported detections show polarization of at most 1% , the lines must be calculated with at least s / n@xmath31 300 in all spectral - resolution - elements .",
    "most young emission - line stars have large line / continuum ratio s ( 5 - 10 ) .",
    "some , such as ab auriga , have pcygni profiles with emission - peak to absorption - trough ratio s of over 20 .",
    "the star p - cygni itself has a ratio of nearly 100 . even when saturating the peak of the emission line on the detector , a s / n of only 100 or so was achieved in the absorption trough of ab auriga .",
    "a flux - dependent averaging procedure has been developed to bin pixels spectrally by flux , to ensure that the s / n per spectral - pixel is roughly constant over the line at the expense of regular wavelength coverage .",
    "another systematic error occurs when you calculate the degree of polarization for a spectrum , a squared quantity , with noise amplitudes that vary across the line . since the average absolute values of noisy data will be higher than clean data , and there will be significant noise variations across strong emission lines , varying noise can mascarade as a systematic spectropolarimetric error .",
    "figure [ fig : qnoise ] shows a simulated polarization measurement where flux - dependent noise was added to eight copies of a single line - profile .",
    "the noise varied from roughly 5% at continuum to roughly 2% in the center of the emission line .",
    "the resulting stokes q and u parameters were centered about zero , but with a varying noise amplitude .",
    "when these measurements are converted to a degree of polarization via @xmath32 , this varying noise shows up as a systematic error in the degree of polarization .",
    "to rebin - by - flux , the average line profile for each data set ( after alignment ) is calculated .",
    "this provides the average flux and shape of all 8 lines . a user - defined threshold , typically 1 - 5 , sets the minimum flux in each rebinned spectral pixel .",
    "the number of physical pixels to rebin at each wavelength is calculated and each individual spectrum is then rebinned accordingly . a rebinned wavelength array for each set is also calculated since the number of pixels binned in the spectral direction is different for each star and data - set .",
    "the polarization analysis is then performed on these rebinned data sets as specified above and the pixel - to - pixel variation in the noise is greatly attenuated .",
    "figure [ fig : rbqu ] shows a comparision of raw and rebinned polarization spectra .",
    "the rebinned spectra only show a few resolution elements over the absorption trough with many covering the emission peak .",
    "the polarization signature in the absorptive part of the line stands out very clearly .",
    "the calculated polarization is sensitive to systematic errors in the alignment of the polarized spectra .",
    "there are two main alignments of the spectra - between the polarized spectra in each individual image , and between the specra from each individual image .",
    "the reduction code automatically makes derivative - error simulations for every data set to show the form of the systematic errors caused by misalignments .",
    "the misalignment between polarization states causes a derivative signal in each fractional polarization measurement @xmath33 that can be at the few % level .",
    "as long as the shift between polarization states is constant in each image , then the derivative signal is subtracted away when the second polarization measurement , @xmath34 , is subtracted .",
    "the polarization state shift between images is very stable .",
    "there is never more than a 0.05 pixel shift difference between the calculated wavelength solutions of each polarized order as determined by thar line fits .",
    "there is also a second order effect - beam wobble - that can cause a systematic polarization error .",
    "if the spectra are misaligned between images , from the rotating waveplate or guiding errors in un - tilted coordinate systems , then a derivative - of - derivative effect can show up when the two polarization measurements are differenced .",
    "we simulate this effect in figure [ fig : derivsim ] by applying a orientation - dependent wavelength shift between the exposures that increases with waveplate angle .",
    "this simulates any beam - wobble introduced by misalignment of the waveplate .",
    "the induced error traces the curvature of the emission line , with polarization errors showing up where curvature is greatest . using thar spectra , we measured this wavelength shift to be @xmath40.1 pixels , depending on waveplate orientation , shown in [ fig : wobble - exp ] .",
    "this small wobble has a very small influence on the polarization , as it takes a misalignment of several pixels to produce a noticable acceleration signal .",
    "the derivative simulations in this code show that the simple derivative error subtracts away completely if the polarized - order - separation is constant ( which it is to 0.05 pixels ) .",
    "the code also shows that it takes a wobble of at least 2 full pixels between each orientation , for a total of a 6-pixels misalignment to produce a 1% systematic error in a stokes parameter for strong lines . using our shift - n - scale routine , as well as the thar measurements",
    ", we have measured this wobble to be around 0.1 pixels and thus present only well below the 0.1% level proportional to the curvature ( derivative of derivative ) .",
    "the next step in the instrument development was calibrating the instrumental polarization response",
    ". absolute polarization at all wavelengths requires very careful calibration of the telescope .",
    "internal optics can induce or reduce polarization ( u , q@xmath35i or i@xmath35q , u ) in the beam , cause cross - talk between polarization states ( qu@xmath35v , v@xmath35qu ) , and also rotate the plane of polarization ( q@xmath35u , u@xmath35q ) . for an instrument at the coud focus of an alt - az telescope , all of these effects are functions of wavelength , altitude and azimuth . for aeos , there are five 45@xmath22 reflections before the coud room , two of which change their relative orientation .",
    "this is particularly severe , and only a few put a spectropolarimeter after so many mirrors .",
    "the calibration is difficult , but some have tried this for many different telescope designs ( cf .",
    "snchez almeida et al . 1991 , kuhn et al , 1994 , giro et al . 2003 )    since there are no spectropolarimetric standards one usually observes polarimetric standards that have a precise value averaged over some bandpass such as hsu & breger 1982 , gil - hutton & benavidez 2003 , schmidt & elston 1992 , or fossati et al . 2007 .",
    "the calibration and creation of a telescope model is done by measuring unpolarized standard stars and polarized sources at many pointings to calibrate the effects of the moving mirrors .",
    "in general , the telescope will have different responses to linearly polarized light since the absorption coefficients of the optical components vary with wavelength and the differential absorption is a function of the angle of the incident polarization with respect to the mirror / component axes .",
    "we used zeemax models of the telescope to compute the assumed polarization properties of the coud focus given various optical constants for aluminum .",
    "these show the expected altitude - azimuth dependence of the mueller - matrix terms , though the amplitudes of the computed effects are significantly different than measured .",
    "while our models can calculate the full mueller matrix as functions of altitude , azimuth , and wavelength , we can not measure all of these terms .",
    "we can , however , measure certain parts of the mueller matrix given proper sources ( polarized standards , unpolarized standards , and scattered sunlight ) .",
    "unpolarized standard stars are the first tool we used to calibrate the telescope .",
    "observations of these standards at as many pointings as possible allows one to construct a model of the telescopes response to unpolarized light and to quantify the telescope - induced polarization ( but not the depolarization , cross - talk , or plane rotation which requires a linearly polarized standard ) .",
    "polarized sources were the last calibration source we used .",
    "using a polarized source allows one to measure the depolarization and rotation of the plane of polarization , all of which are , in principle , orientation dependent .",
    "polarized standard stars are polarized in their continuum light , but the constant value quoted in standard references is an average polarization in a relatively line - free , wide bandpass image .",
    "the degree of polarization is usually not more than a few percent making instrument calibration difficult with these sources .",
    "another calibration method which we will explore below , is to use twilight ( scattered sunlight ) as a highly polarized source with a fairly well known degree and orientation of polarization .",
    "the polarization is certainly not constant and varies with atmospheric properties , time , and pointing , but it is a very bright and highly polarized source that has given us valuable insight into the polarization properties of the mirrors .",
    "all of the moving mirrors in the aeos telescope are located upstream of the polarizing optics ( analyzer ) .",
    "as an illustration of the polarization induced by the reflections between the halogen flat field lamp ( @xmath36 ) and the spectropolarimeter , figure [ fig : flatpol ] shows the polarization reduction applied to a set of flat field frames with the 4 waveplate orientations taken in 2004 .",
    "the flat field lamp is located just after the coud room entrance port , immediately after the coud pickoff mirror ( m7 ) . the lamp is reflected off a diffuser screen and is assumed to be unpolarized .",
    "the flat fields show a significant polarization which changes with wavelength . at 6500@xmath5 ,",
    "the induced polarization is dominated by the + u term , but the u and -q terms become equal at 90 . the position angle varies almost linearly across all wavelengths while the degree of polarization rises from 2% at 650 nm to 6% at 950 nm . since the remounting of the optics and a movement of the image - rotator , the values of the flat field polarization have changed , but this illustrates the magnitude and wavelength dependence of polarization induced by the 11 fixed reflections in the optics room .",
    "we also have tested the polarization of the common - fore - optics .",

    "the measured angles match completely within the manual uncertainty .",
    "this shows that the degree of linear polarization is preserved through the spectrograph optics .",
    "the flat field also shows a difference in beam intensities ( vignetting or beam transmission difference ) , in addition to it s intrinsic polarization .",

    "is applied .",
    "this was calculated as 1.588 and 1.591 for q and u respectively as the null polarization spectra ( sometimes called the check spectra : + q + -q ) . restated , this means the @xmath24q @xmath24u spectra are symmetric about 1.59% , ie that the rotation of the waveplate swaps polarization around a constant difference in beam intensity of 1.59% . subtracting the 1.59% difference in beam intensities from all single - frame polarizations",
    "@xmath37 makes these polarization spectra symmetric about 0% reflecting the true polarization of the beams .",

    "this means that any observed spectropolarimetric signature at some wavelength in a spectral line must be real , and at least at the observed magnitude .",
    "the measured signature could have been depolarized , rotated , translated , or be a cross - talk signature from the stars circular polarization , but the wavelength of the change in the line can not be affected and the amplitude serves as a lower limit on the true spectropolarimetric effect .",

    "the scattered sunlight degree of polarization measurements showed very strong effects of the telescope on a highly polarized source .",
    "the measurements at the zenith showed that the telescope can cause an effective depolarization , from 75% to 15% for the h@xmath3 region .",
    "this effective depolarization was seen to be much less severe at longer wavelengths in our 2005 observations , but we have not repeated those measurements with the new configuration .",
    "the plane of polarization also rotates quite strongly .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the rotation of the plane of polarization was also shown to be strong across all wavelengths , even as the depolarization effect decreased significantly .",
    "the telescopes polarization properties are quite severe and complicated .",
    "the effect on spectropolarimetry is significant , but the telescope can not induce any effects across a spectral line . in effect , the telescope can shift , reduce , or rotate a qu - loop , but it can not create one . thus , any spectropolarimetric signature we detect is a useful lower limit on the magnitude of the polarization change across a line , and a good indicator of the wavelength range of the polarization effects .",
    "as a verification and extension of our hivis observations , we observed two targets with hivis and with another spectropolarimeter , espadons , mounted on mauna kea s 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "espadons is a fiber - fed spectropolarimeter with a resolution of 68000 , roughly 5 times higher than hivis in it s typical lowest - resolution polarimetric mode ( donati et al .",
    "1999 , manset & donati 2003 ) .",
    "the spectropolarimeter has a completely different design with the polarizing optics mounted after the cassegrain focus in a triplet - lens collimated beam .",
    "the instrument uses a dual - beam design with three fresnel - rhomb retarders and a wollaston prism which produces the two orthogonally polarized beams .",
    "the two polarized beams are then focused onto two fibers ( with two additional for sky that are unused in polarimetric mode ) .",
    "the typical exposure sequence is 8 exposures at different frenel - rhomb orientations , 4 each for q and u. the telescope is equatorial and thus does not have any frame - rotation issues as the fibers are always at a fixed orientation on the sky .",
    "this makes the instrument very useful for long integrations .",
    "the fiber entrances do however introduce a strong instrumental continuum polarization , requiring a polynomial subtraction similar to hivis , and making continuum polarization studies impossible with this instrument .",
    "this instrument has a very different setup from hivis and as such is a useful cross - check .",
    "the spectropolarimerty of mwc361 from hivis on the nights of june 18 - 21st 2007 is shown on the left and from espadons on the nights of june 23 & 24th 2007 on the right .",
    "the mwc361 spectropolarimetry from hivis has been arbitrarily rotated by - eye to align the hivis qu - loops with those from espadons .",
    "both data sets have their continuum polarization removed in the respective dedicated reduction scripts by low - order polynomial fits . both have been rebinned to lower spectral resolution for clarity . ]",
    "the spectropolarimerty of hd163296 from hivis on the nights of june 18 - 21st 2007 is shown on the left and from espadons on the nights of june 23 & 24th 2007 on the right .",
    "no rotation has been applied to the hivis data .",
    "the hivis data spans a range of pointings and exposure times .",
    "there is a resemblance between some hivis and espadons observations , but significant telescope polarization effects cause the amplitude of the hivis signature to be smaller .",
    "both data sets have their continuum polarization removed in the respective dedicated reduction scripts by low - order polynomial fits .",
    "both have been rebinned to lower spectral resolution for clarity . ]",
    "we observed mwc361 with the espadons spectropolarimeter on cfht on august 1@xmath39 and 3@xmath7 of 2006 and with hivis on november 7@xmath21 2006 .",
    "we also have a back - to - back observation set of mwc361 and hd163296 with hivis on june 18 - 24th 2007 and with espadons june 26th and 27th .",
    "all data sets were taken in fair weather and reduced with the dedicated , automated esprit data reduction package provided by cfht ( donati et al .",
    "1999 ) . as a further check , we adapted the hivis reduction package to process the espadons data and found very similar results with both packages .",
    "the espadons data shows that over a period of three nights in 2006 ( aug 01 to aug 03 ) and again over 2 nights in 2007 ( june 23rd and 24th ) , the spectropolarimetry from mwc361 is identical within the noise .",
    "the spectropolarimetry nearly a year apart matches very closely , though the intensity profiles change slightly .",
    "our hivis observations , while at lower spectral resolution , show a similar polarized spectrum . a side - by - side comparison of the mwc361 data is shown in figure [ fig : cfh361 ] .",
    "each data set from hivis has been rotated by an arbitrary angle to take out any telescope frame rotation and plane of polarization rotations .",
    "these by - eye rotations align the polarization spectra quite well , showing that hivis can reproduce the espadons measurements quite well .",
    "the espadons observations of hd163296 show a large amplitude polarization change , almost 1% peak - to - peak , near the absorptive component of the emission line .",
    "observations with hivis also show a similar effect at these same wavelengths , but the magnitude of the change in the hivis data is smaller .",
    "figure [ fig : cfh163 ] shows the side - by - side comparsions of hivis and espadons data .",
    "the hivis data has also been de - rotated but the fits are not as good for many of the data sets .",
    "this target had a different and wider range of pointings and could have the polarization amplitude modulated by the telescopes polarization properties .",
    "still , one can clearly see the proper qu shape and even similar values in the hivis observations .",
    "the spectropolarimerty of mwc361 from cfht on aug 01 and 03 2006 plotted as degree - of - polarization and position angle .",
    "the continuum polarization has been shifted to match the mottram et al .",
    "2007 polarization of 0.82% at 95.6@xmath22 or q - u continuum of ( -0.80% , -0.16% ) before calculating these polarization spectra . ]",
    "we can also compare our observations to those of mwc361 taken with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) using the isis spectropolarimeter as presented in the vink et al .",
    "2002 , 2005b and mottram et al .",
    "2007 papers .",
    "the wht is an alt - az telescope and isis is a long - slit spectropolarimeter .",
    "the slit is aligned on the sky by physically rotating the entire spectrograph .",
    "the polarizing optics are almost identical to the hivis design - a savart plate just after the slit creates the to orthogonal polarizations with a rotating quarter- and half - wave retarder mounted in front of the slit .",
    "a polarization observation is four sets of four - wave - plate rotations .",
    "the slit however has only the primary and secondary mirrors upstream , and those near - normal reflections do not induce significant instrumental polarization ( harries et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , the waveplate does produce a very significant 0.2% amplitude ripple that must be subtracted from every high - resolution data set .",
    "the qu - loops from mwc361 from cfht on aug 01 and 03 2006 shown with the mottram et al .",
    "continuum of -0.80% , -0.16% .",
    "stokes q decreases broadly over the line and u provides the small vertical deviations at the qu - loop s maximum amplitude . ]",
    "these wht observations had a resolution of 35km / s or r@xmath48500 , whereas the 1.5 \" slit on the aeos spectrograph has a resolution of r@xmath413000 in the typical polarimetric mode .",
    "all data sets are then binned by flux to a constant polarimetric error .",
    "vink et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter v02 , present data from december 1999 , vink et al .",
    "2005b , hereafter v05 , presents data from december 2001 and mottram et al .",
    "( 2007 ) present data from late september 2004 .",
    "all three data sets show a similar qu - loop and polarization spectrum , though the vink et al .",
    "2002 data has much higher noise .",
    "the continuum polarization was reported as 0.80% to 0.82% at a pa of 94@xmath22 to 96@xmath22 in v02 and v05 respectively .",
    "we can take our cfht and hivis data and scale them to these continuum values ( q=-0.8% u=-0.15% ) and calculate the degree of polarization and pa .",
    "we find a very similar polarization spectrum , though with a significantly different pa spectrum , shown in figure [ fig : cfht - vink ] .",
    "this changing pa is caused almost entirely by the u spectrum changing sharply in the center of the line while q is positive over the whole broad region around the line . in the v02 and v05 measurements ,",
    "the pa change is on the red side of the emission line , with a roughly 20@xmath22 change .",
    "our measurements now show a double - peaked change , still on the red side of the emission line with a similar wavelength range , but now with a two - fold change : a 15@xmath22 increase in pa followed by a 15@xmath22 decrease .",
    "the significance of this is best seen in the qu - loops , shown in figure [ fig : cfht - loop ] .",
    "our plot shows the u changes as both positive and negative with extreme values near -0.4% and 0.1% whereas the v05 qu - loops show only a significant decrease in u with a barely noticeable increase .",
    "this illustrates the type of conclusions one can draw with hivis data .",
    "mwc361 has a high declination , + 68 , and the range of pointings for all observations were quite small .",
    "the star is always low and in the north , from altitudes of 30 - 42 and azimuths of 340 to 20 .",
    "hivis was quite successful at reproducing the spectropolarimetric measurements between espadons and isis .",
    "hd163296 however has a declination of -21 and spans a much greater range of pointings - altitudes from 30 - 48 and azimuths of 132 - 226 .",
    "the signature is still detected at the correct wavelengths , but at a reduced amplitude .     twenty - five q , u , and intensity spectra of @xmath23 cassiopeia taken on many nights from september 2006 to september 2007 .",
    "the plane of polarization has been rotated for each spectra to maximize q in the core of the emission line to provide a relative reference frame .",
    "the average of all the polarization spectra is illustrated as the thick solid line showing a broad 0.2% polarization change across the line . ]",
    "another comparison between the william - wehlau spectropolarimter or wws and hivis is possible ( eversberg et al .",
    "the wws has a design very similar to espadons , but using two achromatic quarter - wave plates instead of two half - wave and one quarter - wave fresnel rhombs .",
    "eversberg et al .",
    "1998 report commissioning observations of @xmath23 cas on the 1.6 m observatoire du mont mgantic ( omm ) telescope that reproduce the 0.2% polarization change originally seen in a pockels - cell polarimeter measurement with the university of western ontario 1.2 m telescope ( poeckert & marlborough 1977 ) .",
    "we see a similar smooth and broad signature in @xmath23 cas as well , shown in figure [ fig : gmcas ] .",
    "the observations have all been rotated by an arbitrary angle to maximize the + q spectrum in the core of the emission line . with the simple , broad form of the polarization signature ,",
    "this has the effect of producing an effective de - rotation to a common polarimetric frame .",
    "the resulting polarization spectra are averaged to produce our best estimate of the average polarization signature , shown as the thick line in figure [ fig : gmcas ] .",
    "this average signature shows an amplitude of nearly 0.2% with a very smooth profile .    in summary , hivis is capable of reproducing spectropolarimetric measurements made with many other instruments",
    ". however , there are some complications that arise from the polarization properties of the coud path that cause some spectropolarimetric measurements to be significantly reduced in magnitude and/or rotated .",
    "we have presented our dedicated idl - based reduction package and the polarization properties of the hivis spectropolarimeter .",
    "this package compares very favorably with other dedicated reduction packages .",
    "the esprit package on espadons and our scripts give very similar results when applied to espadons data .",
    "we have found that the telescope induces 0.5% to 3.0% continuum polarization in an unpolarized source with a strong dependence on secondary focus .",
    "the telescope can also strongly depolarize a source or rotate the plane of polarization as was shown by highly - polarized twilight observations .",
    "all of these are functions of altitude , azimuth , and wavelength .",
    "optical ray trace models with zeemax were presented to illustrate the pointing dependence of the telescope polarization properties , but were ultimately shown to be quantitatively inaccurate due to the very common problem of oxide coatings .",
    "while these telescope effects complicate the analysis of data taken with this instrument , useful information about the amplitude and wavelength dependence of the polarization across a spectral line can still be obtained .",
    "the performance of the instrument was compared to other spectropolarimeters , particularly espadons on cfht , isis on wht , and wws on omm .",
    "hivis found to reproduce the spectropolarimetric signatures , sometimes strikingly well given the possible complications .",
    "this instrument will be able to make sensitive spectropolarimetric observations , despite some complications in the interpretation of the polarization after so many oblique reflections .",
    "this program was supported by the nsf ast-0123390 grant , the university of hawaii and the airforce research labs ( afrl ) .",
    "this program made use of observations obtained at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council of canada , the institut national des sciences de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique of france , and the university of hawaii .",
    "this program also made use of the simbad data base operated by cds , strasbourg , france .",
