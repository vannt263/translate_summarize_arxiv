    "the solar magnetic field is broadly believed to be in the form of concentrated flux ropes in the bulk of the convection zone . at the solar surface",
    "they emerge to form bipolar regions and sunspots in the photosphere that appear as twisted loop - like structures in the higher atmosphere .",
    "however , there is no clear evidence that magnetic fields are generated in flux tubes that emerge from the tachocline all the way to the surface of the sun .",
    "numerical simulations have successfully shown that magnetic buoyancy , which has been thought to be the main driver of flux tube emergence , can be efficiently suppressed by downward pumping due to the stratification with concentrated downdraft in the solar convection zone ( nordlund et al .",
    "1992 ; tobias et al .",
    "large - scale dynamo simulations suggest that flux tubes are primarily a feature of the kinematic dynamo regime , but tend to be less pronounced in the nonlinear stage ( kpyl et al .",
    "an alternative mechanism might simply be the relaxation of strongly twisted magnetic fields reaching the surface of the sun .",
    "twisted magnetic fields are produced by a large - scale dynamo mechanism which is generally believed to be the source of solar magnetic activity ( parker 1979 ) . in order to study the emergence of helical magnetic fields from a dynamo",
    ", we consider a model that combines a direct simulation of a turbulent large - scale dynamo with a simple treatment for the evolution of nearly force - free magnetic fields above the surface of the dynamo . in the context of force - free magnetic field extrapolations",
    "this method is also known as the stress  and  relax method ( valori et al .",
    "including a nearly force - free field in the upper part of the domain has the additional benefit of allowing a more realistic modeling of the dynamo itself .",
    "this is important , because it is known that the properties of the large - scale magnetic field depend strongly on the boundary conditions . in the upper atmosphere , direct numerical simulation of the solar corona show force - free magnetic fields ( gudiksen & nordlund 2005 ) .    above the solar surface",
    ", we expect helical magnetic fields to drive flares and coronal mass ejections through the lorentz force . in the present paper",
    "we highlight some of the main results of our earlier work ( warnecke & brandenburg 2010 ) and present recent applications and results using spherical coordinates",
    "a two layer system is used , where the upper part is modelled as a nearly force - free magnetic field by using the stress  and  relax method ( valori et al .",
    "2005 ) and in the lower part a dynamo field is generated through helically forced turbulence .",
    "we combine these two layers by simply turning off terms that should not be included in the upper part of the domain .",
    "we do this with error function profiles of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the width of the transition .",
    "the equation for the velocity in the stress  and  relax method is similar to the usual momentum equation , except that there is neither pressure , nor gravity , nor other driving forces on the right - hand side , so we just have @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lorentz force , @xmath4 is the current density , @xmath5 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath6 is the viscous force , and @xmath7 is here treated as a constant that determines the strength of the velocity correction .",
    "equation  ( [ dudtext ] ) is solved together with the uncurled induction equation , @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the magnetic diffusivity .      in the lower part",
    "the velocity is driven by a forcing function and the density is evolved using the continuity equation , @xmath10 where @xmath6 is the viscous force , @xmath11 is the specific pseudo - enthalpy , @xmath12 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath13 is a forcing function that drives turbulence in the interior and consists of random plane helical transversal waves with an average forcing wavenumber @xmath14 .",
    "the pseudo - enthalpy @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "equations  ( [ dduu ] ) are solved together with the induction eqs .",
    "( [ ddbb ] ) .",
    "the simulation box is horizontally periodic . for the magnetic field",
    "we adopt vertical - field and perfect - conductor conditions at the top and bottom boundaries , respectively . for the velocity we employ stress - free conditions at both boundaries . in this paper",
    "we present direct numerical simulations using the pencil code , a modular high - order code ( sixth order in space and third - order in time ) for solving a large range of partial differential equations",
    "after a period of exponential growth , the magnetic field saturates at @xmath17 of the equipartition field strength , @xmath18 in the turbulent layer .",
    "this behavior is typical for forced dynamo action .",
    "the structure of the magnetic field is a large - scale field in the turbulent zone",
    ". it always shows a systematic variation in one of the two horizontal directions .",
    "it is a matter of chance whether this variation is in the @xmath19 or in the @xmath20 direction . after the saturation phase the magnetic field extends well into the upper layer where it tends to produce an arcade - like structure , as seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "the arcade opens up in the middle above the line where the vertical field component vanishes at the surface .",
    "this leads to the formation of anti - aligned field lines with a current sheet in the middle .",
    "the dynamical evolution is clearly seem in a sequence of field line images in the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ ai ] , where anti - aligned vertical field lines reconnect above the neutral line and form a closed arch with plasmoid ejection .",
    "this arch then changes its connectivity at the foot points in one of the two horizontal directions ( here the @xmath20 direction ) , making the field lines bulge upward to produce a new reconnection site with anti - aligned field lines some distance above the surface .",
    "field line reconnection is best seen for two - dimensional magnetic fields , because it is then possible to compute a flux function whose contours correspond to field lines in the corresponding plane . in the present case",
    "the large - scale component of the magnetic field varies little in the @xmath19 direction , so it makes sense to visualize the field averaged over @xmath19 .     increasing from red ( positive ) to purple ( negative ) .",

    "again , there is flux emerge through the surface above the turbulence zone .",
    "this can be seen as a recurrent event .",
    "unfortunately , reconnection , current sheets and plasmoid ejections have not been seen in the present setup , although there are indications that they do occur in even more recent spherical models where gravity and density stratification are included .",
    "our first results are promising in that the dynamics of the magnetic field in the exterior is indeed found to mimic open boundary conditions at the interface between the turbulence zone and the exterior at @xmath26 .",
