    "x - ray novae ( xrne ) are a subset of the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , containing a compact object primary ( m@xmath1 ) accreting material via roche lobe overflow from a low mass ( m@xmath2 1 m@xmath3 ) secondary star .",
    "the secondary is normally a k or m - type main sequence star , whereas the primary is either a neutron star or a black hole with a characteristic mass of 1.4 m@xmath3 or @xmath4 10 m@xmath3 respectively .",
    "these systems undergo quasi - periodic outbursts ( recurrence timescales @xmath4 tens of years ) during which their broadband luminosities ( x - ray - radio ) increase by many orders of magnitude .",

    "we observe emission features consistent with both hei and br@xmath6 with equivalent widths of @xmath4 6  & 12  respectively .",
    "also indicated are the positions of a number of the atomic absorption features expected from the secondary star .",
    "we also attempted to place on upper limit on the presence of any co bandheads in the gs 2000 + 25 spectrum .",
    "as the s / n degrades further at longer wavelengths , our efforts were confined to the co ( 20 ) band head at 2.294@xmath0 .",
    "we used a model of this bandhead in the k5v star spectrum to place an upper limit on its presence in the observed gs 2000 + 25 spectrum .",
    "we can rule out the presence of this bandhead with an equivalent width of @xmath7 20% of that expected from a k5v star ( solar abundance ) at the 99% confidence level .",
    "the spectral slope is observed to be consistent with that expected from the k5v secondary star in this system for @xmath8 2.3@xmath9 : for longer wavelengths , the slope appears to flatten . in an effort to constrain the amount of",
    "non - stellar flux present a number of spectra were simulated .",
    "noise was added to a k5v spectrum consistent with the secondary in this system until a s / n ratio similar to the science spectrum was achieved . to this a constant contribution representing an accretion disc with a temperature profile of the form t @xmath10 r@xmath11 was added ( see  [ results ] ) .",
    "we find for a fractional disc contribution of 25% , the simulated spectral slope is no longer consistent with the observed spectrum , indicating a likely disc contribution of @xmath12 25% in the 2.0  2.3@xmath0 wavelength region and more at wavelengths greater than this .      in figures [ the - seds1 ] & [ the - seds2 ] , we plot the extinction corrected optical / ir seds of the xrne as listed in table [ sed - table ] , where the error bars account for the uncertainty in the photometry and the reddening . here , we fit model atmospheres of the appropriate spectral type to the seds of the quiescent xrne : these data include optical , nir and _ spitzer _ measurements .",
    "in contrast to previous authors who normalised to the h - band @xcite or k - band flux @xcite , where the ir contamination from the accretion disc was assumed to be minimal , we choose instead to normalise these models relative to the measured secondary contribution in the r - band , which has generally been more accurately determined using optical spectroscopy .",
    "the models we fit are nextgen model atmospheres @xcite corresponding to the spectral type of the secondary star in each system .",
    "we restrict ourselves to those veiling measurements for which the simultaneously measured r - band flux is consistent with the value used in the sed .",
    "the veiling in all cases is defined as a percentage of the total system flux emitted by the accretion disc , typically measured in the region of the h@xmath13 line ( 6562 ) : @xmath14 and is indicated in the top left hand corner of each sed in fig .",
    "[ the - seds1 ] & [ the - seds2 ] and in the final column of table [ extinct - table ] . as",
    "the various photometric data points used were non - simultaneous , we do not attempt to rigorously quantify the excess in the nir",
    ". the quiescent magnitudes of xrne are typically observed to vary by @xmath4 0.1 magnitudes ( e.g. @xcite ) , in addition to the @xmath4 0.2 magnitude periodic variability due to the intrinsic ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star .",
    "however , when normalised this way , the seds of these xrne are all seen to exhibit an excess of flux at nir wavelengths comparable to that measured in the optical ( also indicated in figures [ the - seds1 ] & [ the - seds2 ] ) . in this sense the nir appears to be just as contaminated as the optical , in the context of measuring the flux from the secondary .      the current paradigm for understanding the emission from quiescent xrne involves a thin disc which transitions to a quasi spherical inner flow at a distance of @xmath4 10@xmath15  10@xmath16 schwarzschild radii from the compact object .",
    "the inner flow is thought to consist of an advection dominated accretion flow ( see @xcite and references therein ) , although it has also been argued that the inner region instead consists of a jet / outflow ( @xcite ) . in an effort to place a constraint on the source of the observed excess nir flux , we have attempted to model the observed sed .",
    "the spectral energy distributions are fit with a multi - component model consisting of :    1 .   a spherical blackbody representing the emission from the secondary star .",
    "2 .   an accretion disc .",
    "+   the flux from the accretion disc may be modelled in the form of a multi - colour blackbody where the temperature profile across the surface of the optically thick geometrically thin accretion disc is @xcite : @xmath17\\right)^{1/4}\\ ] ] this results in t@xmath18 in the case of a viscously heated steady state disc .",
    "+ alternatively , we might expect a flatter temperature profile : for example , t@xmath19 has been observed in the quiescent accretion disc in some cataclysmic variables ( cvs , @xcite ) .",
    "such a temperature profile is intermediate between the classic steady state viscously heated accretion disc ( r@xmath20 ) and the irradiated disc case ( r@xmath21 ) .",

    "+      given the non - simultaneous nature of the observations we do not try to rigorously fit the data ( e.g. via @xmath24 minimisation ) .",
    "none the less , in each case it is clear that a model consisting of an accretion disc extending from 10@xmath15  10@xmath25 schwarzschild radii ( r@xmath26 ) to an outer radius of @xmath4 0.5 the roche lobe radius of the compact object ( r@xmath27 ) , in addition to the secondary star , is required to provide the observed nir flux .",
    "this is consistent with previous observations of the accretion disc in quiescence @xcite . at _",
    "wavelengths , the flux appears to be a combination of emission from the accretion disc / circumbinary disc .",
    "the seds of all the xrne are seen to follow this general pattern .",
    "we emphasise that although the following analysis is qualitatively similar to that carried out by @xcite , it differs in the important aspect that we normalise to the r - band flux , which results in a significant non - stellar component to the observed nir flux ( see  [ m - seds ] ) .",
    "we discuss the fits to each system in more detail below .      in figure [ a0620-bbfit ] , we display the resulting fit in the case of a0620 - 00 .",
    "a steady state disc fit is displayed on the left ; a disc with a flatter temperature profile ( t @xmath28 ) is displayed on the right .",
    "we see that the disc with the flatter temperature profile provides a better fit to the observed sed .",
    "the basic model consists of a blackbody at the temperature of the model atmosphere displayed in figure [ the - seds1 ] , a flat accretion disc extending from @xmath4 10@xmath16 r@xmath26 to @xmath4 0.5 r@xmath27 and a circumbinary disc consistent with the previous estimates of @xcite .",
    "such an accretion disc will contribute @xmath4 40% of the k - band flux . in comparison ,",
    "@xcite recently determined the accretion disc to be contributing @xmath4 23% of the k - band flux through moderate s / n spectroscopy .",
    "given the uncertainties discussed elsewhere (  3.2 , ",
    "4 ) , we regard these values to be consistent with each other .      here",
    "we find a similar model to that described above , in particular a flat temperature profile accretion disc is required .",
    "the slope of the sed is consistent with emission from the secondary plus the accretion disc out to 4.5@xmath0 , however the 4.5 - 8@xmath0 slope clearly indicates the presence of an additional source of flux .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we find a standard circumbinary disc is unable to account for the observed excess .",
    "this is because we account for the accretion disc veiling , which results in a lower contribution from the secondary star at _",
    "wavelengths in this work , requiring a greater flux contribution from the circumbinary disc . instead",
    ", we find a circumbinary disc with a flatter temperature profile similar to the accretion disc is required . in this case",
    "the accretion disc will contribute @xmath4 60@xmath29 of the flux at nir wavelengths .      as is immediately obvious from the sed in fig .",
    "[ the - seds2 ] , the flux from this system is dominated by the emission from the type iv secondary star .",
    "we find the accretion disc to contribute in the region of 25% of the flux in the jhk region of the spectrum .",
    "the excess at 24 microns is also consistent with an origin in the accretion disc .",
    "however , we are unable to rule out a contribution from a circumbinary disc as suggested by @xcite .",
    "cen x-4 is the only system in our sample where the compact object is a neutron star .",
    "however , as in the other systems the secondary star is unable to account for the nir / optical flux , with there being a large excess over that from the secondary at nir and _ spitzer _ wavelengths .",
    "the magnitude of the contribution from the accretion disc is consistent with that observed in the black hole systems mentioned above .",
    "the disc is required to extend from an inner radius of 0.3 r@xmath3 to an outer radius of 0.5 r@xmath27 .",
    "we also note that the 8@xmath0 flux in conjunction with the 24@xmath0 upper limit allows for the possible presence of a circumbinary disc , which contributes up to 20@xmath29 of the 8@xmath0 flux , in contrast to the analysis of @xcite .",
    "such a circumbinary disc will not contribute to the observed k - band emission .      _",
    "gro j0422 + 32 : _ previous observations of gro j0422 + 32 highlighted the likely presence of a large non - stellar nir component in this system @xcite .",
    "modelling of the sed supports this claim , with the accretion disc component providing @xmath4 40% of the observed nir flux .",
    "+ _ gs 2000 + 25 : _ again , here we find the accretion disc contribution to be large , @xmath4 30% in the k - band .",
    "+ _ gs 1124 - 683 : _ the flux from the accretion disc is seen to be @xmath4 40 - 50% of the total flux at nir wavelengths .",
    "as has been demonstrated in the previous section , it is clear that the nir flux observed from quiescent x - ray novae contains a significant component that does not originate in the secondary star . from an analysis of the spectral energy distributions of these xrne",
    ", it now appears that this nir excess is dominated by thermal emission from the cooler outer regions of the accretion disc .",
    "this excess requires the presence of a cool accretion disc with a temperature profile t @xmath10 r@xmath30 ; such a cool disc component ( t @xmath4 3000 - 4000 k ) is expected on theoretical grounds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this temperature profile is intermediate between the classic steady state viscously heated accretion disc ( r@xmath20 ) and the irradiated disc case ( r@xmath21 ) .",
    "the use of a temperature profile of this form is supported by the observation of similarly shallow temperature profiles from eclipse mapping of the accretion discs in quiescent dwarf novae ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "given the difficulty in accurately determining the spectral type of the secondary star in xrne , we also investigated the effect of varying the spectral type ( within the range listed in table [ extinct - table ] ) on the magnitude of the nir excess .",
    "in particular , a later spectral type could account for a significant portion of the observed nir excess ( fig .",
    "[ the - seds1 ] & [ the - seds2 ] ) . using the latest secondary star spectral types allowed ,",
    "as previously determined ( see table [ extinct - table ] ) , the analysis in  [ results ] was repeated .",
    "the observed nir flux is found to remain systematically greater than the relevant model atmosphere for all the systems in our sample , although the magnitude of the excess is found to decrease as expected . in the 7 systems in our sample ,",
    "the observed k - band excess will remain high ranging from @xmath4 10% in a0620 - 00 ( k7v secondary ) to 40% in xte j1118 + 480 ( m0v secondary ) .",
    "the veiling in each system is typically known to within @xmath31 5% , which can lead to an error in the disc flux ranging from 50% ( a0620 - 00 : 10 @xmath31 5 ) to as little as 12% ( cen x-4 : 25 @xmath31 3 ) .",
    "we adopt this as an appropriate estimate for the accuracy of our k - band veiling measurements .",
    "regardless of the magnitude of the excess , it is the _ systematic presence _ of this excess in all of the surveyed systems that is the most convincing evidence for its existence .    in the following sections , we discuss additional spectroscopic evidence for accretion disc contamination of the nir flux in xrne , which support the sed analysis given in  [ results ] and above .",
    "in addition , we consider possible jet emission in the nir , briefly discuss the mir flux and compare the systems containing black hole primaries to the neutron star system .",
    "we end by considering the implications of neglecting to properly account for this additional flux when determining black hole masses .",
    "nir spectroscopy of quiescent black hole xrne has also provided evidence for a non - negligible contribution from the accretion disc .",
    "recent moderate resolution observations of a0620 - 00 by @xcite , support the presence of a near - infrared excess in this system . here",
    "the spectral slope was observed to deviate significantly from that expected of the secondary star alone .",
    "detailed analysis showed the secondary star to contribute 82 @xmath31 2% of the h - band flux and @xmath4 77% of the k - band flux .",
    "@xcite analysed low resolution spectra of the xrn gro j0422 + 32 that displayed significant br@xmath6 emission ; in combination with photometric observations they showed the accretion disc to be contributing up to @xmath4 30% or more of the observed k - band flux .      in this work ,",
    "we have obtained a medium resolution k - band spectrum of gs 2000 + 25 .",
    "emission lines consistent with the accretion disc are detected ( hei , br@xmath6 ) , whereas the intrinsic absorption lines of the secondary star appear to be absent ( although the s / n is low , see fig .",
    "[ gs2000spec ] ) .",
    "modelling of the co ( 20 ) bandhead at 2.294@xmath9 allows us to place a limit on the equivalent width of this feature in our spectrum .",
    "we can exclude the presence of this bandhead with an equivalent width of @xmath7 20% of that expected from a k5v star , at the 99% confidence level .",
    "on the other hand , analysis of the spectral slope of our spectrum allows us to conservatively constrain the accretion disc to be contributing @xmath12 25% of the flux for @xmath8 2.3@xmath0 , and more at wavelengths greater than this , although a more accurate determination is limited by our low s / n ratio .",
    "we regard this as consistent with the value estimated in ",
    "[ m - seds ] & fig .",
    "[ the - seds1 ] .",
    "these results indicate that the co abundance in the secondary star in gs 2000 + 25 is anomalous .",
    "if the co abundance were similar to solar , we would expect to detect the co ( 20 ) bandhead at approximately 75% of the equivalent width found in the k5v spectrum , with the remainder of the line being filled in by the accretion disc continuum , which we have shown contributes @xmath12 25% of the observed flux .",
    "instead , we limit the maximum co ( 20 ) bandhead strength to be 20% of that expected from a k5v star at solar abundance .    in recent observations of a0620 - 00 at similar resolution ( albeit higher s / n ) both @xcite and @xcite detect the co bandheads from the secondary star in absorption .",
    "the co lines detected in a0620 - 00 are observed to be anomalously weak , hinting at possible cno processing in the secondary star @xcite .",
    "observations of the xrne xte j1118 + 480 in outburst reveal a similar situation , with uv spectra displaying evidence for anomalous abundances of c , n & o. this points to cno processing having also taken place in this system @xcite . as explained above , if the c abundance in the secondary star in gs 2000 + 25 was anomalous as is the case in a0620 - 00 ( [ c / h ] = -1.5 ) , this would provide an explanation for their non - detection .",
    "we also note the k - band spectroscopy of wz sge @xcite in which h@xmath32 and co - bandhead emission was detected .",
    "these lines are thought to be produced in dense cool regions as one might expect in the outer regions of the accretion disc in xrne @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible that our non - detection of the secondary star co - bandheads in absorption is due to a combination of an anomalous carbon abundance and infilling of the co - bandheads by similar emission lines emanating from the outer regions of the accretion disc .",
    "unfortunately definitive conclusions require higher s / n observations as demonstrated in case of a0620 - 00 by @xcite .      in an effort to constrain any possible jet contribution to the observed seds ,",
    "a jet component of the form @xmath33 was added to the model in [ results ] .",
    "the jet is assumed to be flat and optically thick ( @xmath34 ) , extending from radio wavelengths and breaking to the optically thin regime ( @xmath35 ) in the optical / ir wavelength range ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "there does not appear to be evidence for a significant non - thermal contribution at nir wavelengths in any of the systems in our sample . in a0620 - 00 and gs2023 + 338 ,",
    "the jet is seen to contribute at most a few percent of the observed flux .",
    "even given the uncertainty in the _ spitzer _ detections at 24@xmath0 @xcite , a jet will contribute @xmath36 5% and @xmath36 10% of the k - band flux in a0620 - 00 and gs 2023 + 338 respectively .",
    "it appears that jet emission in quiescence only becomes an appreciable percentage of the emitted flux as we proceed to the mid - ir region of the spectrum as noted by @xcite .",
    "as we proceed to longer wavelengths , the observed flux will become dominated by emission from the accretion disc / circumbinary disc with a possible contribution also from a jet , in agreement with the analysis of @xcite . in the case of the sources with mid - ir spectral coverage ( a0620 - 00 , xte j1118 + 480 , gs 2023 + 338 , cen x-4 ) , the _ spitzer _",
    "data favours the presence of a circumbinary disc contribution to the observed flux . specifically , whereas a circumbinary disc is capable of accounting for all the mid - ir flux , a flat jet alone can not .",
    "observations of quiescent xrne with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory have discovered that the x - ray luminosity of systems containing black hole primaries appear to be systematically fainter than those containing neutron stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is thought to be due to the fact that the accreting matter strikes the hard surface in the case of the neutron star whereas if the primary is a black hole , the matter is simply advected across the event horizon ( although an alternate interpretation envisions the matter being expelled in a jet / outflow , @xcite ) . hence",
    ", it is worth asking if there is any appreciable difference in the seds of the sources in our sample .",
    "even though we only model a single system containing a neutron star primary , there does not appear to be any discernable difference between the spectral energy distribution of cen x-4 and the 6 systems containing a black hole primary .",
    "this is what one would expect if the emission in the optical / nir region is dominated by the secondary star and the cooler outer regions of the accretion disc instead of radiation from processes taking place closer to the compact object .",
    "in light of the fact that the nir flux from xrne appears to contain a significant non - stellar contribution , it is worth reconsidering previous black hole mass estimates made via ir observations , which neglected to include this non - stellar flux in the analysis .",
    "we can estimate the effect of this additional component using the eclipsing light curve code ( elc , @xcite ) in combination with the previously determined system parameters .",
    "we then add a contribution from an accretion disc with a temperature profile of the form t(r ) @xmath10 r@xmath30 and the inner and outer disc radii set so as to agree with the values determined in  [ results ] .",
    "we estimate that for an accretion disc contribution of only 20% , the black hole masses measured via nir photometry have generally been overestimated by 1  2 m@xmath3 in each case ; this increases to as much as 4 m@xmath3 in the case of a 50% disc contribution .",
    "we have shown that there is a significant amount of contamination present from the accretion disc / circumbinary disc in the ir portion of the sed of quiescent xrne .",
    "fits to the seds reveal nir excesses in each of the 7 systems studied .",
    "we have also presented new k - band spectroscopy of gs 2000 + 25 , which also shows some evidence for contamination : this joins two other black hole xrne with confirmed ir excesses from spectroscopy ( a0620 - 00",
    " @xcite and gro j0422 + 32 ",
    "@xcite ) .    based on these results",
    ", we believe that the currently accepted paradigm , in which the ellipsoidal variations at nir wavelengths are assumed to be undiluted by other sources of flux in the binary , is not valid .",
    "we conclude that the nir offers no significant advantage over optical observations in the measurement of ellipsoidal variability ( and the determination of mass ratio and orbital inclination ) . indeed , assuming the contrary introduces large , systematic errors in the mass estimates for the compact objects in these binary systems .",
