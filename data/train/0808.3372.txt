    "in hard scattering events mesons and baryons can be viewed as bound states built up from partonic constituents , i.e. quarks and gluons .",
    "this picture changes at low energies , where hadronic effects play a more prominent rle in the nonperturbative structure of hadrons .",
    "of particular importance are pion cloud effects which _",
    "e.g. _ have a direct impact on the spin structure of the proton @xcite .",
    "thus they need to be incorporated in bound - state calculations aiming at a realistic description of mesons and baryons .    for the spectrum of light pseudoscalar mesons , it is the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity that governs the pattern of dynamical symmetry breaking , rather than the intricacies of confinement or infrared specifics of qcd . within the framework of schwinger - dyson ( sde ) and bethe - salpeter ( bse ) equations ,",
    "this realisation has led to much phenomenological success in describing pseudoscalar and vector mesons  @xcite , with bound - state masses , decay constants and electromagnetic form - factors determined  @xcite with surprising agreement to experiment  @xcite .",
    "the success of this description partly comes from the vector - vector coupling of the rainbow - ladder truncation , where the resultant spin - coupling to these @xmath0-wave mesons is dominant . for @xmath1-wave states however , such as the scalar and axial - vector mesons , a richer tensor structure is required from the quark - gluon vertex to properly account for the observed spectrum . to this end , the scalar part of the quark - gluon vertex , whose importance regarding confinement has been highlighted in  @xcite , may be the most relevant for introducing a spin - dependence to the interaction .",
    "we expect any beyond - the - rainbow study that generates such terms to have an effect on the spectrum of light mesons .    however , there arise further complications in describing the scalar and axial - vector sector .",
    "not only are models employing the rainbow - ladder truncation too attractive , yielding masses of @xmath2-@xmath3  mev  @xcite , but are these mesons even @xmath4 bound states ?",
    "for the scalars we have tetraquarks , multi - meson molecules , glueballs and the inevitable hybrids as candidates ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , these exotics are not restricted to the scalar sector , for the @xmath5 may be well described as a coupled - channel meson molecule  @xcite , amongst other equally plausible descriptions @xcite .",
    "clearly there is much work to be done in providing a dynamical partonic description of these ` mesons ' , not least in understanding the fundamental interactions between quarks and gluons .    as a further step in this direction we concentrate in this work on improving our model description of @xmath6 bound - states .",
    "based on an approximation scheme for the quark - gluon interaction developed in @xcite and @xcite we study the pion back - reaction on the quarks and light mesons in the covariant schwinger - dyson / bethe - salpeter approach to landau gauge qcd @xcite . as a consequence we take into account pion cloud effects in the light meson spectrum . to this end",
    "we solve the coupled system of quark schwinger - dyson equations and bethe - salpeter equations for pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons in the complex plane .",
    "this provides for an important technical progress compared to the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the so - called real - value approximation has been used . as a further technical complication",
    "we then have to solve the normalisation problem for bethe - salpeter amplitudes generated by a kernel depending on the total momentum of the meson .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we summarise our approximation scheme for the quark - gluon interaction developed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we specify our model interaction and discuss the technical complications that appear in the normalisation condition for the bound - state amplitudes .",
    "we explicitly verify that our interaction satisfies the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity . in sec .",
    "we then provide the details of our calculation and present our results .",
    "we conclude with an outlook in sec .",
    "some technical discussions are relegated to an appendix .",
    "in the past , a widely used practical approximation scheme for the coupled system of quark - sde and meson - bse is the rainbow - ladder approximation .",
    "its most important property is that it satisfies the non - singlet axial - vector ward - takahashi identity ( axwti ) which guarantees that the pion in the chiral limit is both a goldstone boson and a bound state of massive constituents .",
    "this scheme has a history of remarkable successes ( summarised _ e.g. _ in  @xcite ) . however , there are also shortcomings that limit the credibility of such an approximation .",
    "consequently , several efforts have been made to extend this scheme , see _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will continue the strategy employed in @xcite to extend the rainbow - ladder scheme by taking into account pion cloud effects in the quark - gluon interaction .",
    "these effects can be accounted for by a particular class of interaction diagrams that only appear in the unquenched theory .",
    "our strategy is complementary to the one followed in @xcite , where a different class of unquenching effects have been investigated .",
    "the aim there was to provide for hadronic intermediate states in bound - state calculations which generate a finite width of meson spectral functions .",
    "it is also complementary to the investigations reported in  @xcite , where unquenching effects in the gluon polarization have been considered .",
    "we start with the sde for the quark propagator , given diagrammatically in fig .",

    "the quark dressing functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be recombined into the quark mass @xmath17 and the quark wave function @xmath18 .",
    "the quark self - energy depends on the fully dressed quark - gluon vertex @xmath19 and the gluon propagator @xmath20 with the gluon dressing function @xmath21 . throughout this paper",
    "we will work in the landau gauge , which guarantees the transversality of ( [ gluon ] ) .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath21 used in this work will be given in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the key quantity in the sde for the quark propagator is the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "it satisfies its own schwinger - dyson equation which contains various basically unknown four - point functions .",
    "the structure of the yang - mills part of this equation and the resulting pattern of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking has been discussed recently in detail in ref .",
    "here we are interested in the hadronic contributions to this vertex .",
    "these have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , where two slightly different approximations in terms of one - pion exchange have been constructed .",
    "whereas the scheme of @xcite resulted in a very strong back - reaction of the pion onto the quark propagator in disagreement with corresponding lattice results , the modified scheme in @xcite seems to represent these effects quantitatively correctly .",
    "we therefore resort to the latter scheme here , whose diagrammatic expressions for the quark - sde and the corresponding bethe - salpeter equation for quark - antiquark bound states are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse2 ] and [ fig : bse ] .    .",

    "the up - down arrow indicates an averaging procedure of the pion - exchange diagram with its counterpart where the upper pion - quark vertex is bare and the lower one dressed .",
    "[ fig : bse ] ]    the effective self - interaction of the quark is thus given by a pure yang - mills part and a hadronic part approximated by one - pion exchange .",
    "the dressed coupling of the pion to the quark line is hereby described by its bethe - salpeter vertex function , whereas the bare one is given by @xmath22 with the generators @xmath23 of flavour su(2 ) .",
    "certainly it is important that the explicit form of both the yang - mills part and the pionic part of the interaction is such that the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity is satisfied .",
    "naturally , as a first guess for the yang - mills part one takes a rainbow - ladder form of the interaction , _ i.e. _ one chooses a model for the fully dressed yang - mills part of the quark - gluon vertex @xmath24 of the form @xmath25 where we denote the quark momenta by @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the gluon momentum by @xmath28 .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath29 is detailed below .",
    "a similar form has been used in  @xcite , where quenched lattice results for the quark propagator have been reproduced .",
    "note , however , that ( [ v1 ] ) involves only the @xmath30-part of the tensor structure of the full yang - mills part of the vertex .",
    "it has been shown in the analysis of the full quark - gluon vertex of ref .",
    "@xcite that such a model can not capture all essentials of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , from the results of this work we will draw the very same conclusion from our calculation of the light meson spectrum .",
    "in general one can decompose the quark - gluon vertex @xmath31 into 12 different tensor structures , given by @xmath32 the details of this basis are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we only note that @xmath33 ; the explicit forms of the other structures are not needed . in principle , all twelve tensor structures are important in the infrared and intermediate momentum regime @xcite .",
    "we have verified by projection methods that the pion - exchange diagram in the vertex - sde indeed contributes to all these structures .",

    "however , we see in the next section that substantial effort is required to calculate the normalisation condition with any kernel involving momentum exchange of the meson .      the first term of ( [ norm ] ) , independent of the kernel , is easily evaluated since the quark propagator derivatives are directly calculable in our approach ; either by applying the derivative to the quark - sde , and solving the resulting integral equation , or by finite difference methods .",

    "whilst for maris - tandy , the inclusion of pion - exchange is attractive giving rise to a @xmath141  mev shift , our model exhibits repulsion of the order of @xmath142  mev .",
    "the leptonic decay constants see a decrease of 10% for both models .",
    "the effect of including hadronic contributions is not then _ a priori _ known , at least for those mesons most sensitive to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    ".bse results for the pseudoscalar , scalar , vector and axial - vector mesons for the maris - tandy and soft - divergence models employed with ( incl. ) and without ( w / o ) pion backreaction .",
    "the parameters marked by @xmath143 are fitted to reproduce the pion mass and decay constant when the pion - exchange kernel is switched on .",
    "consequently the model parameters , given in the text , are modified compared to the original maris - tandy model @xcite .",
    "results for the pure rainbow - ladder kernel without pion back - reaction are for the same parameter set .",
    "decay constants given in parenthesis are those that would result without calculating the full normalisation condition of the appropriate meson.[results ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the remaining light mesons , the inclusion of the pion back - reaction generally leads to a lighter spectrum . in the case of the scalar meson",
    ", we see a reduction of @xmath144  mev for both interactions , though the relative drop is significantly different at 20 and 40% for maris - tandy and our model respectively .",
    "the vector meson - here identified with the @xmath145 - receives a negative shift of @xmath146  mev , or @xmath147 for both interactions . in the case of maris - tandy",
    ", the resultant rho mass of @xmath148 mev is similar to that obtained in other studies with this interaction  @xcite . here , unquenching has the effect of increasing the decay constant by @xmath149 .",
    "our interaction yields a lighter mass of around @xmath150  mev , with unquenching increasing the decay constant by just @xmath151 .",
    "since our truncation scheme does not provide a mechanism for the @xmath145 to decay into pions , we do not observe the tell - tale non - analytic behaviour of the rho mass as a function of the pion mass , due to the opening of a decay channel , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next , we examine the axial - vectors @xmath5 and @xmath152 , which differ by their charge conjugate properties . as already seen , the net effect of including the pion back - reaction is a reduction in the meson mass .",
    "for the axial - vectors , we see a @xmath153  mev reduction in the bound - state mass for both charge eigenstates and in both models of the interaction .",
    "it is evident , at least with our tractable unquenching truncation scheme , that unquenching effects do not resolve the difficulties we have in obtaining reasonable masses for these mesons .",
    "however , we note that the anomalous mass - splitting in calculations of the @xmath5 and @xmath152 in our model is half that of maris - tandy .",
    "in the course of our investigations of possible parameter sets , we could easily obtain near degenerate axial - vector masses within our interaction .    finally , we take a look at the masses of the @xmath154 and @xmath68 . for our model , which exhibits a soft - divergence in the gluon momentum ,",
    "we calculate a non - zero topological mass following ref .",
    "we see that the inclusion of the pion back - reaction on the quark propagator has a minimal effect on the phenomenologically determined mass - splittings .",
    "using an approximation scheme for including pion loop effects in the quark - gluon interaction , we investigated effects of the pion cloud in the bethe - salpeter and schwinger - dyson equations . by considering only the leading amplitude of the exchange pion , moreover taken from its chiral limit solution , we were able to include the analytic behaviour beyond the real - value approximation employed in the previous study @xcite .",
    "the resulting interaction respects the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity .    as a consequence of this technical improvement",
    ", we were forced to tackle the added complication of calculating the full normalisation condition of the bethe - salpeter equation where the momentum exchange of the kernel need be considered .",
    "we found that this indeed gives a sizable contribution of the order of a few percent that must be properly taken into account in order to extract the correct leptonic decay constants .    as a result",
    ", we found considerable pion cloud effects in the spectrum of light mesons .",
    "in particular we found a shift of about @xmath146 mev for the mass of the rho - meson in agreement with expectations from chiral extrapolations of quenched lattice data @xcite .",
    "though this truncation scheme represents a tractable model for including hadronic unquenching effects , it is clear that spin dependent contributions from the yang - mills part of the quark - gluon vertex will have a strong impact upon the spectrum of light mesons .",
    "such corrections will form a part of future investigations .",
    "we are grateful to michael buballa and dominik nickel for fruitful discussions on the pion back - reaction .",
    "we thank peter tandy for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work has been supported by the helmholtz - university young investigator grant no . vh - ng-332 .",
    "one of the key approximations here is that the leading bethe - salpeter amplitude for the pion may be well approximated by the chiral limit result @xmath155 .",
    "it is important for the amplitude to feature the correct asymptotic behaviour at large momenta , and so for a massive pion in the exchange kernel we employ the scalar self - energy @xmath156 as calculated in the chiral limit ( for complex momenta ) .",
    "the differences between this and the full amplitude are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] and are seen to be at the level of a few percent",
