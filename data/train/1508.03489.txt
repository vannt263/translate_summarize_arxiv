    "many experiments aiming at recording so - called `` molecular movies ''  the atomic - resolution imaging of the intrinsic structural dynamics of molecules  rely on molecules fixed - in - space , , aligned or oriented samples of molecules  @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising approaches is coherent x - ray diffractive imaging , for instance , using short - wavelength free - electron lasers or synchrotrons  @xcite .",
    "these modern light sources , especially upcoming free - electron lasers with very large photon fluxes such as the european xfel  @xcite or lcls ii  @xcite , but also synchrotrons  @xcite as well as table - top laser systems based on optical - parametric chirped - pulse amplification ( opcpa )  @xcite , operate at very high repetition rates with ten - thousands to millions of pulses per second , sometimes in burst modes , which have to be matched by the high - intensity optical control lasers .",
    "the alignment of gas - phase ensembles of molecules exploits the interaction between the anisotropic polarizability of the molecule and non - resonant linearly or elliptically , polarized electric fields  @xcite .",
    "the electric field strengths necessary for strong ( quasi ) adiabatic alignment are on the order of @xmath9 , even when exploiting very cold samples  @xcite , and must be applied over durations longer than , or at least comparable to , the rotation periods of the molecules  @xcite . these range from tens of picoseconds for small molecules to nanoseconds or even microseconds for larger molecules .",
    "adiabatic mixed - field orientation requires the addition of a moderate dc electric field and even longer laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional control requires elliptically polarized fields with fully controllable ellipticity  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , injection - seeded nd : yag lasers operating at a repetition rate of some 10  hz were used to provide the necessary fields .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated the use of chirped pulses from amplified ti : sapphire laser systems at 1  khz  @xcite and the implementation of this amplified - chirped - pulse technique at the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) at 120  hz  @xcite .",
    "continuous - wave ( cw ) lasers would allow for the control of molecules at arbitrary repetition rates .",
    "furthermore , they would enable long interaction times .",
    "for instance , molecules or particles traveling through a 50  laser beam with a velocity of 100  m / s  @xcite would experience an effective pulse duration of 0.5  .",
    "however , the use of cw lasers to provide the envisioned field strengths with focal beam waists in excess of @xmath10 would require optical power levels of 30300  kw , respectively , with a beam quality that allows for such tight focusing with a rayleigh length comparable to the molecular beam diameter on the order of 1  mm .",
    "100-kw - class cw lasers have been realized as fiber lasers  @xcite , as co@xmath5 lasers  @xcite and as chemical deuterium fluoride lasers  @xcite .",
    "coherent beam combining  @xcite is also a viable approach to achieve laser output at this power level  @xcite .",
    "the thin - disk laser ( tdl ) geometry has been shown to be suited for very high cw output powers in combinition with yb@xmath8-doped gain materials  @xcite .",
    "outputs exceeding 27  kw were demonstrated  @xcite and 100-kw - systems are anticipated  @xcite .",
    "so far these high output powers of thin - disk lasers and fiber lasers are only available at beam qualities  @xcite that do not allow for the tight focusing necessary to achieve the envisioned focal intensities .",
    "in contrast , carbon dioxide and chemical lasers have good beam qualities at even higher output power , but their demanding space requirements and the possibly toxic gain materials are a significant drawback for using the setup as a mobile user facility at modern x - ray light sources . moreover ,",
    "operating and propagating any laser at such high output power levels imposes serious safety risks .    here , we propose to provide the necessary field strength in an intracavity focus of a cw tdl resonator .",
    "a resonator with low losses , low output coupler transmission , and high intracavity power has a low stored excitation energy in the crystal , a high photon energy storage in the resonator and comparably low output power .",
    "the required pump power levels are reasonably low due to the strong enhancement in the active cavity and allow for a cost efficient system , without an exceptional laser - safety risk . in combination with its small spatial footprint ,",
    "such a system is an ideal candidate for flexible and safe employment at modern light sources .",
    "a long multiply - folded resonator allows for tem@xmath11 operation and enables to focus the beam with the necessary rayleigh length of 1-mm .",
    "operation , focused inside of a vacuum chamber leads to the required focal intensities for alignment of molecules .",
    "( b ) : mode averaging in the resonator yields in smooth intensity distribution and avoids spatial hole burning . ]",
    "the envisioned aligned - molecule - imaging experiments impose a number of design criteria on the tdl .",
    "these arise partly from the actual molecular physics and partly from the need for integration of the alignment laser into the complex and constraining machinery of the experimental setup , schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonator - scheme ] .",
    "the ultra - high - vacuum needs impose further restrictions on the design of the setup .    in order to ensure the alignment of all probed molecules , the electric field intensity of @xmath12 utilized to control the molecules , has to be spatially and temporally smooth and nearly constant over the diffraction volume .",
    "the latter is defined by the overlap of the few - mm - diameter molecular beam and the 10 - -diameter x - ray - beam .",
    "such a homogeneous field can be achieved inside the tdl resonator through multi - longitudinal - mode operation , as depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : resonator - scheme ] .",
    "the different modes average out the field distribution around the interaction point .",
    "for a few ten modes a longitudinally practically homogeneous field is achieved in the resonator . under these conditions ,",
    "spatial hole burning could only occur close to the end mirrors .",
    "multi - longitudinal mode operation does not impose a serious challenge for the bandwidth of the laser material or the resonator design . at a typical lengths of a tem@xmath11 tdl of 1  m",
    ", hundreds of longitudinal modes fit into 1  pm of laser emission bandwidth in the 1  wavelength range .",
    "yb@xmath8-doped lasers typically exhibit emission bands with much broader bandwidths in the nanometer range .",
    "the laser beam needs to be focused to create the necessary field strength . at the same time",
    ", the tdl beam needs to be larger than the x - ray beams , which are typically kept on the order of 10  to avoid radiation damage  @xcite , and its rayleigh length needs to be long enough to provide the necessary field strength over the width of the molecular beam of typically a few mm .",
    "this results in an envisioned focal waist of the tdl of approximately 2040  .",
    "such small focal spot sizes require sophisticated astigmatism compensation , which has to be considered in the resonator design .",
    "furthermore , a stable linear or elliptical polarization state is required .",
    "the cold molecular beam has to be delivered to the intracavity focus and the degree of alignment needs to be monitored , for instance , through velocity map ion imaging ( vmi )  @xcite . at the current state , the dimensions of the delivery mechanics and the vmi device require a clear space of tens of @xmath13 around the focus .",
    "moreover , the x - ray beam must pass the focus nearly collinear with the tdl intracavity mode to achieve a good overlap with the volume of strongly aligned molecules .",
    "finally , the laser wavelength must be off - resonant with respect to the molecular sample to avoid excitation and radiation damage from the control beam .",
    "as the electronic transitions of molecules are typically in the ultraviolet or visible spectral range and vibrational excitations in the mid - infrared range , this requirement is usually fulfilled by yb@xmath8-based lasers with emission wavelengths around 1  .",
    "in a first proof - of - principle experiment a tdl was set up in a short longitudinal resonator .",
    "this allowed to characterize different gain materials at low output coupler transmissions with respect to their losses and their efficiencies .",
    "the experiments were carried out utilizing a yb(7  % ) : y@xmath14al@xmath15o@xmath7 ( yb : yag ) disk ( dausinger+giesen ) with a thickness of 0.22  mm and a yb(3  % ) : lu@xmath16o@xmath14 disk with a thickness of 0.25  mm @xcite . due to the different cation densities",
    "@xcite in both host materials , the different values for the yb@xmath8-doping correspond to a similar yb@xmath8-density of ~10@xmath17  @xmath18 .",
    "both disks were soldered onto copper - tungsten - alloy heat - sinks ( 20/80 for @xmath2and 10/90 for @xmath3 ) , which were cooled at a water temperature of during the experiments .",
    "the disks were pumped by 600  -core multimode fiber coupled ingaas laser diodes , which were imaged onto a 1.2  mm diameter pump spot on the disk . for the @xmath2disk a pump wavelength of 940  nm corresponding to a broad @xmath2absorption band in this wavelength range",
    "was chosen . the jenoptik jold-75-cpxf-2p laser diode utilized for this purpose had a maximum output power of 75  w and up to 56  w were used in the experiments .",
    "in contrast , @xmath3provides a much stronger absorption at the zero - phonon line around 976  nm@xcite .",
    "the corresponding jold-50-cpxf-2p pump laser diode provided up to 50  w of output power which was fully utilized .",
    "the temperature of the pump diodes was adjusted to fine - tune the emission wavelength for an optimum absorption of the pump power .",
    "after the 24 pump - light passes in our tdl module , more than 99  % of the pump power was absorbed .",
    "a simple plane - concave resonator with a length of 60  mm and different output coupling mirrors with radii of curvature ( roc ) of 100  mm ( roc of the disks @xmath19 2  m ) was set up for efficient multimode laser operation .",
    "the output - coupling mirrors had transmissions between @xmath20 and @xmath21 for all wavelengths between 1  and 1.1  .",
    "the output coupler transmissions were initially measured with a spectrometer ( varian cary 5000 ) and cross - checked by measuring the transmission of the output of a @xmath3tdl operating at wavelength of 1080  nm through these mirrors .",
    "the laser output power was measured with a coherent lm-100 power meter . to avoid damage of the disks we limited the maximum pump power to the value which resulted in a disk surface temperature of @xmath22 . for this purpose",
    "we monitored the surface temperature of the laser disks with a sc645 thermographic camera ( flir systems ) .",
    "the measured values were corrected by the temperature dependent emissivity of the respective gain material .",

    "it should be noted that these @xmath25 are significantly below the optimum @xmath25 for maximum laser output for these materials  @xcite .",
    "thus , the efficiencies reported here are lower than previously reported  @xcite . however , from the measured efficiencies it can be concluded that the losses through the output coupling mirror are significantly higher than the losses in the disks at these output coupler transmissions . for both materials , this results in low surface temperatures even at pump powers of 50  w , which range from around for large output coupler transmissions to the highest surface temperatures of and for @xmath2and @xmath3 , respectively , measured at the lowest output coupler transmission rate of @xmath20 . here",

    "nota bene , this is an upper level for the intracavity losses due to energy conservation .    the intracavity power considering realistic resonator losses of @xmath50 plus additional losses @xmath51 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 due to output coupler transmission or other intracavity elements required e.g. for the polarization selection were calculated for pump powers @xmath54 between 100  w and 600  w with @xmath55 this equation can be simplified by assuming a threshold power @xmath56 of zero , which is appropriate as pump thresholds @xmath57  w were observed in all experiments .",

    "@xmath58 can be nearly exclusively attributed to losses in the tdl assembly , , the laser - medium disk with its dielectric coatings and the metallic contacting layer .",
    "while the @xmath2disk showed in general better performance , our experiments do not provide conclusive evidence about the material - specific advantage of @xmath2or @xmath3 . using a pump power of 54",

    "this is to the best of our knowledge the highest documented cw intracavity power for a pump power lower than 100  w. typically , such cw intracavity powers are only achieved using pump powers of 10  kw .",
    "the slope efficiencies obtained with @xmath2and @xmath3of 0.66 and 0.72 , respectively are in good agreement with previous results at such low output coupling transmissions  @xcite .",
    "the measured laser performance at various low output coupler transmissions below @xmath21 allows to precisely determine an upper limit of the internal resonator losses of a few @xmath60 , which is about an order of magnitude lower than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "this also demonstrates the low losses of the thin - disk laser resonator and the excellent quality of the utilized disks , which benefited from improvements in the crystal growth and in optical coating methods over the last decade .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : calculations](b ) reveal that intracavity power levels in excess of 0.5  mw can be achieved at pump powers of a few 100  w , even at total resonator losses in the order of @xmath61 , which would be five times higher than the intracavity losses of @xmath39 we determined for multi - mode linear tdls using state - of - the - art processed gain materials and standard resonator mirrors . at such intracavity power levels , the required focal intensities for molecular alignment in the order of @xmath62@xmath63",

    "figure 3 ( b ) also shows that minimized resonator losses are of crucial importance for achieving high intracavity power levels at moderate pump power levels .",
    "we note that we operated our tdl at output coupler transmissions in the order of @xmath60 .",
    "however , in the upcoming experiments the resonator losses will be increased by additional resonator elements , for instance a brewster plate . at intracavity powers in excess of 100  kw even a very low transmission of 10@xmath64 results in leakage of more than 10  mw , which allows for a reliable determination of the intracavity power .",
    "moreover , we expect the main additional losses to occur due to depolarization at polarization control elements , , reflections at brewster elements or transmission losses at mirrors with a polarization dependent reflectivity .",
    "both should increase resonator extraction efficiency and thus avoid hot - spots in the cavity .",
    "therefore , the disk temperatures should remain lower than demonstrated here , even when using hr mirrors .",
    "the considerations so far were independent of the pump spot diameter on the disk .",
    "we have shown that further scaling of the intracavity power may lead to strong heating of the disk .",
    "this can be circumvented by choosing larger pump spot diameters , which allows to use significantly higher pump powers .",

    "a 4.7  mm pump spot diameter has been reported at a pump power of up to 830  w  @xcite ; this corresponds to pump power intensities on the order of @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the output coupler transmission was optimized for high extraction efficiency , but at the maximum output power of 430  w the remaining pump power deposited in the disk was still as high as 400  w. this pump power level should be sufficient for our experiments .",
    "the application of the laser for molecular alignment requires operation in vacuum and polarization control .",
    "preliminary results in vacuum ( @xmath66  mbar ) point towards an increased operation stability due to the lack of atmospheric turbulence , in agreement with previous reports  @xcite .",
    "further experiments are required to explore further challenges , , the corresponding lack of convection cooling of the optical elements and mounts . for",
    "the alignment experiments it would be sufficient to keep only the focal area of the resonator in a vacuum chamber , but the required additional brewster windows and polarization optics would add complexity and increase the total resonator losses .    when operated in ultra - high - vacuum ( @xmath67  mbar ) and combined with a continuous cold supersonic molecular beam  @xcite",
    ", the demonstrated laser system will allow to strongly align and orient molecules at `` arbitrary '' repetition rates .",
    "the continuous presence of aligned molecules will enable the envisioned application of strongly controlled molecules in modern imaging experiments at high - repetition rate x - ray facilities  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated a thin - disk laser providing 135  kw of cw intracavity laser power .",
    "this corresponded to an enhancement by a factor of 2500 with respect to the incident pump power of 54  w , enabled by the low losses of state - of - the - art - processed gain disks .",
