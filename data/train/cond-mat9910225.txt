    "a system of electrons on a square lattice in an uniform magnetic field displays an energy spectrum with multifractal properties .",

    "see , for example , @xcite . a lot of effort has been concentrated to find the hausdorff dimension of the spectrum at a given magnetic flux . for a rational magnetic flux , i.e. @xmath0 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 relatively prime integers ,",
    "there are @xmath2 bands in the spectrum .",
    "the scaling hypothesis , @xcite , states that the majority of the bands behaves asymptotically as @xmath3 when @xmath4 the rest of the bands being exponetially small .",
    "the hausdorff dimension does not depend on the asymptotic behaviour of the exponentially small bands .",
    "the multifractal analysis is concentrated on the bands of the scaling type .",
    "the exponentially small bands were studied from a semiclassical aproach in a number of papers .",
    "consult @xcite and references therein .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the asymptotic properties of the product of bandwidths , so that both scaling and exponentially small bands will manifest themselves in the asymptotic formula .",
    "first i discuss a method to obtain the band spectrum .",
    "second , i define more precisely the problem i will address .",
    "the hamiltonian of electrons on a square lattice in a uniform magnetic field , in terms of magnetic translations @xmath5 and @xmath6 is given by    [ hamil ] h = t_1+t_1^*+(t_2+t_2^ * ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath7 obeys the following commutation relation [ com ] t_1 t_2=e^it_2 t_1 . in ( [ com ] ) , @xmath8 is the magnetic flux .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite for details about magnetic translations . only the case @xmath9 will be considered hereafter .    for a rational magnetic flux , [ flux ] = 2 ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes a @xmath10 matrix . from now on , @xmath1 and @xmath2",

    "the hamiltonian is represented by the following matrix : [ matrham1 ] h()= (    ccccc a_1 & b_1 & 0 & & |b_q +    0 & |b_2 & a_3 & & + & & & & b_q-1 + b_q & & 0 & |b_q-1 & a_q    ) ,    where @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14    chamber s relation , @xcite , states that the characteristic polynomial of the hamiltonian matrix decomposes into a @xmath15  -independent polynomial @xmath16 of degree @xmath2 and a function @xmath17 .",

    "for the example in figure @xmath25 , @xmath37 , these eigenvalues are : @xmath38 the energies @xmath39 are called midband energies .",
    "these energies were studied in @xcite using bethe - ansatz .",
    "the problem can be now stated : find the asymptotic formula for the products of the bandwidths , i.e. [ bandprod ] _",
    "n .    in the last section of the paper ,",
    "i obtain that , for a week magnetic field @xmath40 the asymptotic formula can be arranged as a product of terms , each term approaching zero faster than the next neighbour term , ( [ prodas ] ) : [ prodasintr ] _",
    "n=1^q_n ~2 ^ -q^2q^-q ( -qd_0+d_1+o(1 ) )",
    ". here , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are some constants .",
    "we will compare now this result , ( [ prodasintr ] ) , to results from multifractal analysis of the band spectrum .",
    "the multifractal analysis requires the power sums of the bandwidths to be evaluated and the goal is to find the function @xmath43 defined by [ sum ] q^f()=_n=1^q _",

    "than the total number of bands can be decompose as @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the number of bands that asymptotically behaves like @xmath53 now the formula ( [ sum ] ) can be rewritten as [ sumfg ] fqe^q g()+(1-f ) q q^f()-1=_n=1^q _ n^. here @xmath54 is a function which describes the effect of all exponetially small bands . than by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath44 at @xmath45 , but now in ( [ sumfg ] ) , we get ( using @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) [ f ] fg^(0)q^2+(1-f)f^(0)qq=_n=1^q _ n. in this case both leading terms in ( [ prodasintr ] ) are present in ( [ f ] ) and by comparing the coefficients we can write @xmath57 the above formulae , ( [ coef ] ) , are valid for the case of a weak magnetic flux @xmath58",
    ". it will be interesting to find the fraction @xmath47 as a function of the flux . by the scaling hypothesis ,",
    "the fraction @xmath47 is close to @xmath59 i want to emphasise that the formula ( [ sumfg ] ) is a hypothesis and work remains to be done to understand the behaviour of @xmath60 see @xcite for a detailed study of multifractal properties and the bibliography therin .    before ending this section ,",
    "i write the polynomial @xmath16 as a characteristic polynomial of a tridiagonal matrix . in this way it will become easier to compute the moments of the roots of the polynomial @xmath16 , which we need to obtain the asymptotic formula ( [ prodasintr ] ) .",
    "the moments will be the main object of study in section @xmath61 from this point to the end of the introduction , the formulas are taken from @xcite .",
    "the roots of @xmath16 are special eigenvalues and correspond for those @xmath15 for which @xmath62 .",
    "studying the polynomial @xmath16 becomes more facile if we choose another representation for the hamiltonian matrix : @xmath63 in this case the hamiltonian matrix acquires the form : [ matrham2 ] ( ) = (    ccccc 0 & a_1 & 0 & & |a_q +    0 & |a_2 & 0 & & 0 + & & & & a_q-1 + a_q & & 0 & |a_q-1 & 0    ) ,    with @xmath64    chamber s relation in the above representation is : [ polcar2 ] ( ( ) -e)=p_p / q(e)+ ( ) , where [ cham2 ] ( ) = ( -1)^q-1 2 ( ( q _ 1)+(-1)^p(q ( _ 2+_1 ) ) ) .",
    "this last representation is convenient because for the special value @xmath65 simultaneously [ zero1 ] ( _ 0)=0 and [ zero2 ] a_q(_0)=0 , which makes @xmath66 a tridiagonal matrix .",
    "out of this tridiagonal matrix , recursive equations can be deduced for generating the polynomial @xmath67 let @xmath68 be a sequence of polynomials generated by the following relations : @xmath69 where [ beta ] _",
    "n=4 ^ 2 ( n)(n=1,2,,q ) , @xmath70 it follows that @xmath71 and that the polynomial @xmath16 is the characteristic polynomial of the following tridiagonal matrix , which contains only positive numbers : [ m ] m= (    ccccc 0 & _ 1 & 0 & & 0 + 1 & 0 & _ 2 & & + 0 & 1 & 0 & & 0 + & & & & _ q-1 + 0 & & 0 & 1 & 0    ) , [ polcar3 ] p_p / q(e)=(m - e ) .",
    "from the paper @xcite , it is known that the bandwidths obey the inequalities ( with @xmath72 ) : [ yoramineq ] < _ n < , n=1,,q , where @xmath73 is the derivative of @xmath16 computed at the eingenvalue @xmath74 which are the roots of @xmath67 as a consequence , [ prodineq ] ( 2 + 25)^q < _ n=1^q_n < ( 8e)^q .",
    "the product @xmath75 can be reexpressed as : [ vanderprod ] _",
    "j > i=1^q(e_j - e_i)^2 . the formula ( [ vanderprod ] )",
    "can be written as a product of two vandermonde determinants.@xmath76 by this observation , the product @xmath75 can be written in terms of the eingenvalue moments , defined as [ moments ] s_2k=_n=1^qe_n^2k , k=1,2,3 .",
    "putting it all together , it results : [ prodband ] ( 2 + 25)^q < _ n=1^q_n < ( 8e)^q , where @xmath77 is the hankel determinant : [ hankel ] _",

    "the next section is dedicated to this study .",
    "in the begining of this section , i am going to show that [ mometformula ] s_2k = q_j=0^[k^2/4]a_j(k)(2j p / q ) if q > k , where @xmath80 are integer numbers that do not depend on @xmath1 and @xmath81 here @xmath82 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath83    to see this , note that the eigenvalue moments can be computed from the trace of the powers of the matrix @xmath84 , ( [ m ] ) : [ trace ] s_2k = tr(m^2k ) .",

    ", the only nonzero terms will come for those powers @xmath99 which do not depend on @xmath100 this fact is only a consequence of the structure of @xmath101 and not on @xmath1 and @xmath81 the sum over @xmath102 will collect @xmath2 identical terms so in the result the parameter @xmath2 will be factor out . note that for a fixed @xmath95 the same @xmath103-structure is present for all @xmath104 for @xmath105 , some @xmath106 are not present .",
