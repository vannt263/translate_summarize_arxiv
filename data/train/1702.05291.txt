    "parton densities in hadrons play significant roles in understanding standard model processes as well as in the predictions for such processes at accelerators .",
    "the particle physics community have been so far successfully able to determine the global fits for parton distribution functions from various experiments in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , zeus @xcite at hera .",
    "one of the important and interesting aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is to determine the parton density at very small momentum fraction x , where x is also known as the bjorken variable .",
    "some of the most interesting phenomena in this small - x region are the increase of the parton density as x approaches to zero , the growth of the mean transverse momentum of parton inside the parton cascade at small - x , and the saturation phenomena @xcite of the parton density . in the small - x region study of the gluon density",
    "is particularly important because here gluons are expected to dominate the hadron structure function .",
    "study of the gluon distribution function is very important also because of the fact that it is the basic ingredient in the calculation of various high energy hadronic processes like minijet production , growth of total hadronic processes etc . even in the high energetic processes like p - p , p - a and a - a collision at rhic and at cern",
    "s lhc , reliable predictions of these processes depend on the precise knowledge of the gluon distribution at small - x .",
    "knowledge of gluon distribution is also important for the computation of inclusive cross - section of hard processes , collinearly factorizable processes for computing cross - sections of proton - proton scattering etc .",
    "also , in the context of studying about the nuclear pdfs ( npdfs ) , a reliable knowledge on free proton pdf should be known@xcite . a beautiful discussion on the importance of gluon distribution function and various related phenomenon at high energies is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so far there have been indirect approaches in determining the gluon distribution by probing electron into proton and thus by measuring the proton structure function @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the four momentum transferred squared or virtuality of the exchanged virtual photon , h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite at hera made us being able to extract information about the gluon distributions in the formerly unexplored region of x and @xmath2 .",
    "this method is however , indirect because at small - x @xmath7 actually probes the sea quark distribution , which are related via the coupled qcd evolution equations to the gluon distribution .",
    "moreover , direct determinations of the gluon distribution can be obtained by reconstructing the kinematics of the hadronic final state in the gluon induced processes .",
    "direct method of determination of gluon density have been carried out using events with @xmath8 mesons in the final state @xcite and dijet events @xcite .    in the perturbative qcd ,",
    "the high-@xmath2 behaviour of parton densities have been successfully studied in the context of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) using the linear dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the number density of the partons can be evaluated at large-@xmath2 by solving the linear dglap equations in order to calculate the emission of additional quarks and gluons compared to some initial distribution .",
    "the results are then adjusted to fit the experimental data ( mainly at small - x ) available for the proton structure function @xmath7 measured in dis , over a large range of values of x and @xmath2 by adjusting the parameters in the initial distributions . with much phenomenological success approximate solutions of the linear dglap evolution equations have been reported in recent years @xcite .",
    "dis of electron into proton in particular at the hera facility in desy , have provided information about the parton distribution at small - x .",
    "it is evident from the data that there is a sharp growth of gluon density as x grows smaller .",
    "this phenomenon is well backed up by the solutions of linear dglap equation which also predicts sharp growth of gluon density towards small - x . however , the gluon density can not grow forever in order to not violate the unitarity bound @xcite on the physical cross - sections .",
    "hadronic cross - sections comply with the froissart bound @xcite which states that the total cross section does not grow faster than the logarithm squared of the energy i.e. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scale of the range of the strong force . a distinguishing effect known as the gluon recombination",
    "is believed to be able to unitarize the cross - sections at high energies .",
    "gluon recombination can also provide explanation to any possible saturation of the gluon distribution function at small - x",
    ". the number of gluons at high energy or small - x will be so large that they will spatially overlap with each other .",
    "so , the gluon recombination is also as important as the gluon splitting .",
    "gluon recombination effect can also play important role in studying about the nuclear shadowing corrections at small bjorken x.@xcite in deriving the dglap evolution equation the gluon interaction terms were omitted .",
    "these interaction terms induce nonlinear corrections to the linear evolution equation . at small - x",
    "these corrections of the initial gluons to the evolutionary amplitude should be taken into account .",
    "the dglap evolution equations are able to describe the available experimental data quite well in a fairly broad range of x and @xmath2 with appropriate parametrizations . despite of the impressive success of dglap approach there are some distinct issues that appear in trying to make global fits to the data available from h1 collaboration at hera@xcite , in the large @xmath2 region @xmath11 as well as in the hera in the region @xmath12 . moreover , in nlo analysis of mrst2001@xcite when both these regions were included , a good overall fit was found but with a negative gluon distribution . in the cteq@xcite collaboration ,",
    "the large-@xmath2 region fits global fits are in good agreement with the data while the agreement with small-@xmath2 region becomes worse .",
    "the problem with negative gluon distribution also appear in the nlo set cteq6m@xcite .",
    "the above mentioned problems are significant because they can be a signal of gluon recombination effect towards smaller values of x and ( or ) @xmath2 ( but still @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the qcd cutoff parameter ) @xcite .",
    "these effects thus lead to nonlinear power corrections to the linear dglap equations .    while considering the gluon interaction terms ,",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "[ 31 - 34 ] performed detailed study of this region and they have suggested in their pioneering papers@xcite that these shadowing corrections could be well explained within a new evolution equation known as the glr - mq equation . the main difference of this equation from the linear dglap equation is the presence of the quantity , @xmath15 which is interpreted as the two - gluon distribution per unit area of hadron . the main features of glr - mq equations are that it predicts saturation of the gluon density towards small - x , it predicts a critical line which separates the perturbative regime from the saturation regime and its validity lies in the borders of this critical line @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of the glr - mq equation is that it introduces a characteristic momentum scale @xmath16 , which measures the density of the saturated gluons .",
    "gribov et al .",
    "first suggested a nonlinear evolution equation , they interpreted the evolution kernels as gluon recombination functions at the double - leading logarithmic approximation ( dlla ) in a covariant perturbation framework @xcite .",
    "glr - mq equation is regarded as a ` key ' link from perturbation region to the non - perturbation region .",
    "there has been much work in recent years inspired by glr - mq approach that explain the saturation of gluon density at small - x . the ` key ' ingredient is the gluon recombination in this glr - mq approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite the predictions for the gluon saturation scale using glr - mq equation were studied .",

    "@xcite.various studies in the solutions and viable generalisations of the glr - mq equation have been reported in recent years @xcite .",

    "( related works refs .",
    "@xcite ) we obtained a solution of the @xmath2 and x dependence of gluon distribution from glr - mq equation in leading order(lo ) . in our previous work",
    "we addressed the question about the validity of the well known regge - like parametrizations in the region of moderate-@xmath2 . in this work",
    "we will restrict ourselves to moderate-@xmath2 region and try to obtain a solution of the glr - mq equation upto next - to - leading order(nlo ) and will try to compare our @xmath2 evolution result with the results obtained by global analysis of pdf s by various collaborations like pdf4lhc15@xcite , nnpdf3.0@xcite , herapdf1.5@xcite , ct14@xcite and abm12@xcite .",
    "the glr - mq equation is a balance equation in which the increase in the number of gluons in a phase space cell @xmath17 gets balanced by the decrease in gluon density through annihilation process . in terms of the density of gluons , glr - mq equation(with transverse size @xmath18 ) in the transverse plane is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "only the production of new gluons(emission ) is essential because @xmath23 , but at @xmath24 the gluon density @xmath25 grows up and the recombination of gluons become significant . in terms of the gluon distribution function equation ( 1 ) can be expressed as @xmath26 ^ 2 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the value of the factor @xmath27 was calculated by mueller and qiu @xcite .",

    "the quark - gluon emission diagrams are omitted due to their negligible contribution to the gluon - rich small - x region .",
    "the negative sign in front of the nonlinear term is responsible for the gluon recombination .",
    "the strong growth generated by the linear term gets tamed by this nonlinear term .",
    "so , this term describes the shadowing corrections .",
    "the size of the nonlinear term depends on the value of r. for @xmath32 shadowing corrections are negligibly small , whereas for @xmath33 , shadowing corrections are expected to be large enough , @xmath34 being the radius of the hadron in which the gluons are populated @xcite    we introduce a variable @xmath35 , where @xmath14 is the qcd cutoff parameter .",

    "it is interesting to see in our phenomenological analysis that the gluon distribution @xmath3 of our nlo solution lies slightly above the lo result as @xmath2 increases and x decreases .",
    "this is due to the contribution from the nlo term in the splitting function @xmath106 . as we go on decreasing x , the taming of @xmath3",

    "18 ) is valid only in the vicinity of the saturation border .",
    "it can be observed that our results show almost similar behavior to those obtained from various global parametrizations groups and global fits .",
    "however , the nonlinearities play important role for @xmath108 .",
    "we have investigated the effect of nonlinearities in our results for different values of r and @xmath5 .",
    "the gluon distribution function @xmath3 shows steep behaviour at r=5 @xmath4 whereas the taming of @xmath3 is more prominent at r=2 @xmath4 as @xmath2 increases and x decreases . besides",
    ", it is also clearly seen that our result is sensitive to the value of regge intercept @xmath5 as x goes on decreasing .",

    "<S> we have compared our result of @xmath3 as @xmath2 increases and x decreases , for two different values of r , viz . </S>",
    "<S> r= 2 @xmath4 and 5 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked the sensitivity of the regge intercept @xmath5 on our results . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our computed results with those obtained by the global analysis to parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) by various collaborations where lhc data have been included viz . </S>",
