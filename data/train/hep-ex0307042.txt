    "at the frascati @xmath7 factory da@xmath8ne @xcite a large number of @xmath1 mesons is produced via the radiative decay of the @xmath7 meson .",
    "+ the @xmath7 mesons are produced in the collision of @xmath9 beams into the da@xmath8ne collider and 1.298 % of them decay into the @xmath10 final state . up to",
    "now @xmath11 @xmath1 mesons have been produced and are present in 410 pb@xmath0 collected by the kloe experiment in years 2001 - 2002 .",
    "+ the @xmath1 meson is an even eigenstate of the charge coniugation operator _",
    "c _ , while a photon is an odd _ c _ eigenstate .",
    "so any decay of the @xmath1 meson into a final state with an odd number of photons violates the _ c _ symmetry . in the standard model ,",
    "the c symmetry is exactly conserved in both strong and electromagnetic decays , but it is violated in weak decays due to the v - a structure of the weak couplings . in the framework of the standard model",
    "the decay rate of the @xmath12 has been evaluated @xcite , and generalizing this result to the @xmath1 case , one obtains br@xmath13 . + for this reason the discovery of a larger decay rate would be a clear signal of sm violation . at the moment",
    "all the predictions of alternative models are far below the experimentally achievable limits .    from the experimental point of view",
    "the only published result is that of gams2000 experiment ( 1984 ) which has obtained the upper limit @xmath14 at 90 % c.l .",
    "@xcite . there is also a preliminary result from crystall ball collaboration ( ags / cb ) at brookhaven which sets the limit at @xmath15 at 90 % c.l .",
    "both the above experiments are of fixed target type , in which the @xmath1 meson is produced through the reaction @xmath16 with @xmath17 gev / c for gams and 760 mev / c for ags / cb .",
    "the detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber , dc @xcite , surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter , emc @xcite , both immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.52 t with the axis parallel to the beams .",
    "the dc tracking volume extends from 28.5 to 190.5 cm in radius and is 340 cm in length . for charged particles the transverse momentum resolution is @xmath18 and vertices",
    "are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of @xmath19 3 mm .",
    "the calorimeter is divided into a barrel and two endcaps and covers 98@xmath5 of the solid angle .",
    "photon energies and arrival times are measured with resolutions @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the photon entry points are determined with an accuracy @xmath22 along the fibers , and @xmath23 cm in the transverse directions .",
    "a photon is defined as a calorimeter cluster not associated to a charged particle , by requiring that the distance along the fibers between the cluster centroid and the impact point of the nearest extrapolated track be greater than 3@xmath24 .",
    "two small calorimeters , qcal @xcite , made with lead and scintillating tiles are wrapped around the low - beta quadrupoles to complete the hermeticity .",
    "the trigger @xcite uses information from both the calorimeter and the drift chamber .",
    "the emc trigger requires two local energy deposits above threshold ( @xmath25 mev in the barrel , @xmath26 mev in the endcaps ) .",
    "recognition and rejection of cosmic - ray events is also performed at the trigger level , checking for the presence of two energy deposits above 30 mev in the outermost calorimeter planes .",
    "the dc trigger is based on the multiplicity and topology of the hits in the drift cells .",
    "the trigger has a large time spread with respect to the beam crossing time .",
    "it is however synchronized with the machine radio frequency divided by four , @xmath27 = 10.85 ns , with an accuracy of 50 ps . during the period of data taking",
    "the bunch crossing period at da@xmath8ne was @xmath28 = 5.43 ns .",
    "the @xmath29 of the bunch crossing producing an event is determined offline during the event reconstruction .",
    "the signal in this analysis is @xmath30 , the cross section corresponding to the pdg2002 upper limit is very low : @xmath31 0.0215 nb ( at kloe the @xmath7 production cross section is about 3 @xmath32b ) .",
    "so , background studies should cover all possible neutral processes at kloe .",
    "the most important process which gives 4 photons in the final state is @xmath33 with @xmath34 but also important are processes with less or more than 4 photons in final state which mimic 4 photons events because of cluster splitting or merging and accidental clusters due to machine background .",
    "the agreement with mc in the background description is very hard to obtain due to the above effects which are very difficult to reproduce ; so we have estimated the background directly from data and used the mc only to evaluate the detection efficiency of the signal .",
    "+ to this aim a generator of @xmath35@xmath36 with pure phase space for the decay dynamics has been used to produce 120,000 @xmath37 events .",
    "first a preselection is applied to the reconstructed events of the neutral radiative stream . a recover splitting procedure ( applied both to data and to mc events )",
    "is implemented to reduce the number of split clusters ; moreover it is required that every cluster does not have an association with a dc track .",
    "reconstructed data also include beam position [ 8 ] and @xmath7 energy momentum determination , obtained run by run from the analysis of bhabha events .",
    "mc includes cluster time offset correction , and simulation of software filters used to select events for the neutral radiative stream .",
    "the following cuts are applied to the events :    \\1 ) ntime=4    requires 4 photons with the correct time of flight @xmath38 : @xmath39 ; @xmath40 being the distance of the cluster from i.p . and @xmath41 being the calorimeter time resolution .",

    "200mev    these last two cuts reject events from channels with more than 4 photons in the final state which give background if some photons are lost .",

    "these cuts further reject accidental clusters and qed background .",
    "at this point a kinematic fit procedure is applied to the four photons to improve the energy resolution .",

    "the main source of background is given by the channel @xmath55 where a photon comes from isr radiation .",
    "this is evident by making a kinematic fit of the event in the @xmath56 hypothesis and looking to the plot of the @xmath57 variable ( choosing the most energetic one between the two photons not linked to the @xmath58 ) ( see fig . [",

    "in this section we evaluate various systematic effects , especially those which may arise from differences between the data and mc distributions used in the analysis .",
