    "therein ) have been studied intensively during the last decade . however , in spite of their much more simple , less correlated , 3d electronic structure compared with high-@xmath12 materials , the superconductivity in borocarbides is still under debate . based on the interpretation of many magnetic , muon spin resonance , spectroscopic , specific heat , etc .",
    "measurements @xcite it is widely accepted that the superconducting ( sc ) state has an @xmath13-wave symmetry and the pairing is mediated by the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) interaction . on the other hand for the magnetically ordered borocarbide superconductors the role of the crystal - electric - field ( cef ) splitting of the 4@xmath14-shell states of the @xmath15 ion and their excitations are of fundamental importance to understand both ordering phenomena .",
    "additionally , the el - ph interaction responsible for the sc state in these compounds has also been analyzed within the multiband eliashberg theory @xcite with emphasis on the complex fermi surface with different contribution to the sc state by different orbitals on different fermi surface sheets @xcite .    in the family of borocarbide superconductors",
    "is distinguished : it exhibits a remarkable reentrant superconductivity and a variety of magnetic orderings @xcite .",
    "the reentrant behavior occurs in a temperature range just above the commensurate antiferromagnetic order at about @xmath165.2k and below the temperature @xmath17 k , which separates the low - temperature magnetic commensurate phase from the high - temperature paramagnetic phase by a not completely resolved yet intermediate incommensurate magnetic phase . in the same temperature range between @xmath9 and @xmath18 incommensurate structures do occur : an _ a_-axis - modulated one and a spiral structure along the _ c_-axis .    by point - contact ( pc ) spectroscopic investigations",
    "@xcite both the sc order parameter and the pc electron - boson(phonon ) interaction ( eb(p)i ) spectral function @xmath19 can be determined in studying the first and second derivatives of the @xmath20 characteristic of pcs .",
    "the measurement of the second derivative of the @xmath20 of pcs provides straightforward information on the pc eb(p)i function @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath21 for conducting systems is a touchstone to the phonon - mediated superconductivity which is governed mainly by the value of the el - ph - coupling parameter @xmath22 . moreover , the comparison of the experimentally determined @xmath23 with the results of model calculations could be used to distinguish between different scenarios .",
    "thus the pc spectroscopy could be helpful to illuminate many details of the epi in honi@xmath1b@xmath1c as well as to resolve other possible quasiparticle interactions , e.g. , mediated by magnons and cef excitations .",
    "in addition to this the sc gap determines the behavior of the @xmath20 curve for the pc in the energy range of a few mev .",
    "hence , this region is widely used to determine the sc gap from a routine fitting by the well - known blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) equations @xcite .",
    "all this potential information should be used to deepen the present sparse knowledge of the sc properties and to help to elucidate the mechanism(s ) of superconductivity of the title material .    up to now , honi@xmath1b@xmath1c has been investigated by pc spectroscopy in @xcite .",
    "the first three papers are devoted to investigations of the sc gap . in general ,",
    "standard isotropic bcs ( eliashberg)-type behavior of the gap was found below t@xmath24 , while between @xmath9 and @xmath28.5k the sc features in pc spectra are strongly suppressed and speculation about some different sc state @xcite or  gapless ",
    "superconductivity @xcite were undertaken .",
    "the pc ebi spectra for honi@xmath1b@xmath1c were studied and analyzed in ref.@xcite . there",
    ", the main attention was devoted to the study of the low energy part of the spectra and to the investigation and understanding of the so called  soft  mode at about 4mev in the electron - quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "however , the measured spectra were featureless above 20mev , although a number of pronounced phonon peaks are well resolved at higher energies by neutron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in this study we present more detailed pc ebi spectra of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c in comparison with those mentioned in the refs . given above including also our recent data presented at two international conferences sces04 and m2s - htsc - viii @xcite .",
    "additionally , to explain our findings with respect to the sc gap we provide support for the separation of magnetism and superconductivity on different fermi surface sheets in magnetic borocarbides @xcite .",
    "we have used single crystals of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c grown by a floating zone technique with optical heating @xcite .",
    "the residual resistivity is @xmath25 cm and the residual resistivity ratio rrr=13 .",
    "final series of measurements were done for sample with improved quality with rrr=19 .",
    "the sample becomes superconducting at about 8.5k .",
    "pcs were established both along the c axis and in perpendicular direction by standard  needle - anvil  or  shear  methods",
    "@xcite . as a counter electrode cu or ag thin wires ( @xmath26=0.15 mm ) were used .",
    "the spectra with resolved phonon features like in fig.[hof1 ] were registered by touching of the sharpened cu wire on a shallow bright caving of about 1@xmath271mm@xmath28 on the honi@xmath1b@xmath1c crystal surface ( see inset in fig.[hof1 ] ) .",

    "the dotted curve shows an example of the tentative behavior of the background for the dash - dot curve spectrum . a magnetic field of 0.5 t",
    "is applied to suppress superconductivity .",
    "the arrows mark a  magnetic  ( m ) peak at about @xmath293mv , a cef peak , and positions of other resolved peculiarities on the curves maxima .",
    "the inset shows a sketch of the pc configuration ( see also the text for more details).,width=359 ]",
    "according to the theory of pc spectroscopy @xcite the second derivative @xmath30 of the @xmath31 curve of the ballistic contact at low temperatures , where @xmath32 , is determined by the pc epi function @xmath19 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the pc diameter , e is the electron charge and @xmath35 , roughly speaking , measures the interaction of an electron with the phonon branches .",
    "this interaction is affected by large angle scattering ( back - scattering ) processes @xcite of electrons in the constriction of the pc .",
    "thus @xmath19 is a kind of transport epi functions which select phonons with a large momentum or umklapp scattering . in practice @xmath36",
    "can be extracted from the measured rms signal of the second @xmath37 ( @xmath38 d@xmath39/d@xmath40 ) harmonic of a small alternating voltage @xmath41 ( @xmath42 d@xmath43/d@xmath44 is the first harmonic signal ) superimposed on the ramped dc voltage @xmath43 , so that from ( [ pcs ] ) : @xmath45 in the case of a heterocontact between two metals the pc spectrum represents a sum of the contributions from both metals 1 and 2 weighted by the inverse fermi velocities @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the relative volume occupied by metal 1 in the pc .",
    "thus , using of the heterocontacts enables also us to estimate the relative strength of the ebi in the investigated material as compared to some standard or well known case .    to study the sc gap we have measured @xmath48 characteristics of n - c - s pcs ( here n denotes a normal metal , c is the constriction and s is the superconductor under study ) .",
    "then utilizing the generally used blonder - tinkham - klapwijk equations @xcite fits of the measured curves have been performed . as fit parameters the sc gap @xmath49 and the dimensionless barrier parameter @xmath50",
    "have been used .",
    "a possible additional smearing of the d@xmath51d@xmath44 curves was also taken into account by including the parameter @xmath52 , usually interpreted as a broadening of the quasiparticle dos in the superconductor due to finite life - time effects .       with subtracted background ( 3 upper solid curves ) .",

    "magnetic  peak at about 4mv , best visible for the two upper curves .",
    "the bottom dotted curve shows the pc spectrum of cu .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks the position of the first maximum in the cu spectrum .",
    "the dashed curve presents sum of the pc spectrum of cu with a function scaled by the phonon dos from panel ( b ) .",
    "( b ) the neutron phonon dos for luni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite.,width=302 ]    our pc spectra of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c demonstrate clear maxima at about 3 , 10 , 16 and 22mv , a smeared maximum at 34mv , and a hump around 50mv ( fig.[hof1 ] ) .",
    "the maxima above 15mv correspond well to the phonon dos maxima of the nonmagnetic sister compound luni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite [ see fig.[hof2](b ) ] derived from inelastic neutron scattering data .",
    "only the high energy part of the pc spectrum is remarkably smeared .",
    "fig.[hof2](a ) displays the pc ebi function , obtained from the pc spectrum after subtraction of the background . according to the neutron data @xcite",

    "also averaged for two contacts spectrum ( solid line ) is shown , while in the inset averaged for the positive and negative bias spectrum of the same contact is shown by solid line .",
    "temperature is 3k and magnetic field is applied to suppress superconductivity.,width=359 ]    we have also succeeded to receive pc spectra with well resolved high energy maxima around 50 and 100mv ( see fig.[hof2a ] ) .",
    "the position of the 50-mv maximum coincides with the maximum in the phonon dos for luni@xmath1b@xmath1c shown in fig.[hof2]b , even the shoulder at about 60mv is resolved in the pc spectra ( this feature is more clear at the negative bias ) . in the phonon dos for the nonmagnetic sister compound yni@xmath1b@xmath1c",
    "a maximum at around 100mev has been observed in ref .  .",
    "it has been attributed to the high - frequency b - c bond stretching vibration in accord with theoretical results obtained in frozen phonon calculations at 106 mev for the zone - center raman active mode of yni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite .",
    "the low - energy part ( @xmath54mev ) of the pc spectra in fig.[hof2a ] shows a less detailed structure as compared to the spectra from fig.[hof1 ] . here",
    "maxima only at about 4 , 10 and 15mv are seen .",
    "also a shoulder in the range of 22mev peak is visible which is more pronounced at negative polarity and as shown for the spectra in the inset .",
    "however , in interpreting these spectra we have to take into account for possible contribution of cu derived phonons since cu has been used as a counter electrode ( needle ) .",
    "the dashed curve in fig.[hof2](a ) presents the sum of the cu pc spectrum and the phonon dos from fig.[hof2](b ) .",
    "it is seen that contributions from cu may be appreciable for the spectrum of the 41@xmath53 contact in the range between 1520mev , while the two other spectra have pronounced maxima at 16 and 22mev , i.  e. at energies higher than the maxima in the cu spectrum at 15 and 20mev .",
    "moreover , all honi@xmath1b@xmath1c  cu spectra contain no visible contribution from the weaker cu peak at about 27mev , therefore we conclude that a contribution of cu is unsubstantial at least for the two upper spectra in fig.[hof2](a ) .",
    "apparently , the low fermi velocity in nickel borocarbides @xcite as compared to the noble metals accentuate the intensity of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c features according to eq.([het ] ) .",
    "contrary , the pc spectra in fig.[hof2a ] have likely a contribution from cu derived phonons in the region 1520mv , which masks the expected honi@xmath1b@xmath1c phonon maxima so that the 22mev maximum looks like a broad shoulder . in fig.[hof2a](inset ) also the asymmetry of the spectra versus bias voltage polarity is clearly seen in the energy region of cu phonons , which is characteristic for heterocontact , if the contribution from both electrodes to the spectrum is comparable @xcite .    ) ] of several honi@xmath1b@xmath1c  ag pcs with a dominant 10-mv peak ( the @xmath55 marks the cef peak , the @xmath56 mark the position of the main phonon peaks from fig.[hof2]b , the black triangle marks the ",
    "magnetic  peak at about 4mev ) : ( a ) two spectra with a dominant 10-mev peak . in the first case",
    "the superconductivity is suppressed by magnetic fields , in the second case  by high temperature .",
    "the latter curve is measured on a cleaved small piece of a honi@xmath1b@xmath1c single crystal .",
    "the bottom curve shows the pc spectrum of ag .",
    "( b ) the modification of the spectrum with a dominant 10-mv peak for various applied magnetic fields.,width=302 ]    the most prevalent type of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c pc spectrum is shown in fig.[hof3 ] . here",
    "a maximum close to 3mv and another one around 10mev are dominant . the latter maximum",
    "might be connected with cef excitations , observed in this range by inelastic neutron scattering studies @xcite .",
    "the maximum around 3mev is associated with a magnetically ordered state , since it disappears above the nel temperature mainly in the range 810k ( see dashed curve in fig.[hof3](a ) ) and it can be suppressed by a magnetic field of a few tesla ( see fig.[hof3](b ) ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the origin of this peak will be given in the next section .",
    "at the energy of about 10mev a contribution from the first peak in the phonon dos could also be expected .",
    "for luni@xmath1b@xmath1c the first phonon peak is observed at about 9mev ( see fig.[hof2](b ) ) .",
    "for the lighter ( about 6% ) ho ions the peak position may be somewhat shifted to higher energies .",
    "note also that the measured phonon dispersion curves @xmath57 for honi@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite have a tendency that @xmath58 around 1012mev pointing to an enhanced phonon dos ( or maximum ) in this region .",
    "however , we have observed that the 10-mv maximum is considerably affected by a magnetic field ( see fig.[hof3](b ) ) , therefore a contribution of cef excitations to the 10-mev peak seems to be appreciable . unfortunately , due to",
    " magnetic forces  it was difficult to keep the mechanical contact stable in magnetic fields above 5 t , especially when the field direction was out of the @xmath59-axis .",
    "therefore the influence of the magnetic field on the 10-mev peak ( to separate cef and phonon contribution to this peak ) could be investigated only qualitatively so far .",
    "the spectra discussed here demonstrate weak and smeared phonon maxima above 10mv ( see arrows in fig.[hof3](a ) ) in contrast to the spectra shown in fig.[hof2](a ) , but they have a pronounced 10-mv peak ( see fig.[hof3 ] ) , which points to the importance of cef excitations in the transport properties of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "besides , the electron - cef interaction may be also important for a complete understanding of the mechanism of superconductivity in this compound .",
    "we emphasize that the spectra with the dominant 10-mv peak were qualitatively the same independent of the counter electrode ( ag or cu ) which discards remarkable contribution to the pc spectra from these metals ( see the pc spectra of cu and ag in figs.[hof2]a and [ hof3]a ) .    from the measured ebi function",
    "( see fig.[hof2](a ) ) the ebi parameter @xmath60 was calculated , which was found to be smaller than 0.1 only . however , there are large uncertainties in the determination of @xmath61 if heterocontacts are used .",
    "first , this is because the relative volume @xmath47 occupied by the investigated sample in a pc can deviate from 1/2 [ see ( [ het ] ) ] .",
    "secondly , the deviation from the ballistic regime in pcs has to be corrected by a pre - factor @xmath62 in ( [ het ] ) , where @xmath63 is the elastic electron mean free path and @xmath34 is the pc diameter .",
    "however , @xmath63 is difficult to evaluate for pc .",
    "further , the available pc theory and all its equations such as eq.([pcs1 ] ) have been derived in the framework of the free electron model and a single - band fermi surface .",
    "then , paying attention that the contribution of cu in the pc spectra of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c - cu heterocontacts in fig.[hof2](a ) is hardly to be resolved we can conclude that the intensity of the ebi function in honi@xmath1b@xmath1c has to be larger than that in cu , where @xmath640.25 @xcite .",
    "this provides a complementary confirmation of the moderate strength of the ebi in honi@xmath1b@xmath1c with a lower bound of 0.25 for @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "moreover the 10-mv peak contributes about 20 - 30% to the @xmath65 value indicating that cef excitations should be taken into account to understand the sc properties of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "the contribution of the high frequency modes to @xmath65 can be estimated from the spectra in fig.[hof2a ] .",
    "it amounts about 10% for each of the 50 and 100mv maxima .",
    "note , that by estimating @xmath65 we discard the contribution of the ",

    "( b ) pc spectra of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c  ag contact established along the a - axis with varying of the magnetic filed direction relative to the @xmath59-axis.,width=302 ]      let us turn to the low energy maximum around e@xmath66 mev . as we mentioned above it",
    "is very probably related to a magnetic ordering , since it disappears at temperatures @xmath67 810k ( see fig.[hof4](a ) ) and it can be suppressed by an external magnetic field ( fig.[hof4](b ) ) .",
    "figure[hof4](b ) shows that by increasing the angle between the applied magnetic field and the @xmath59-axis , the height of the maximum goes down and its position changes .",
    "thus , this maximum is more robust , if the field is applied along the @xmath59-axis .",
    "this is in line with the result reported in ref .   that for a field along the @xmath59-axis the antiferromagnetic phase with @xmath68k is robust up to quite large fields , while for the perpendicular directions",
    "this antiferromagnetic phase is already suppressed above @xmath69=0.5 t at @xmath70=3k . for our pcs",
    "both @xmath71 and the magnetic field which suppresses the ",
    "magnetic  peak are higher .",
    "in particular , especially the magnetic field is enhanced which reaches here up to 5 t ( see fig.[hof3](b ) ) . in this context",
    "it should be mentioned that inside a pc a remarkable ( uniaxial ) pressure can be created .",
    "this might cause an increase of @xmath72 with a ratio up to d@xmath72/d@xmath738k / gpa @xcite .    for completeness",
    "it should be mentioned that spectra with a dominant 3 mev peak ( its position may vary between 2.5 and 5 mev ) and the practically absence of any other maxima were observed on uncleaved  as - grown  surfaces of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "later on the electron probe microanalysis showed deviations from the stoichiometry on this surface , which can modify both t@xmath74 and the characteristic magnetic field .",
    "as mentioned in ref .",
    "crystallographically oriented thin plates of the nonsuperconducting honibc compound have been observed in selected parts of as - grown honi@xmath1b@xmath1c crystals .",
    "it is well - known that the 1:1:1:1 compound honibc exhibits long - range magnetic order below @xmath7510k @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of a  magnetic  peak persisting up to 10k may be connected with admixture of 1:1:1:1 phase .",
    "thus , the origin of the ",
    "magnetic  peak in the pc spectra has to be still under debate and we will consider further scenarios .",
    "it could be connected with a transition to the thermal regime by a voltage rise , which produces peak - like features in the pc spectra at e@xmath76k@xmath77 ( here @xmath78 is a magnetic transition temperature ) as it was shown for ferromagnetic metals @xcite . however , this is not likely the case , because an increase of temperature in the pc would drastically smear the phonon maxima in the spectra as well . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the reabsorbtion of nonequilibrium phonons generated by electrons in a pc leads to a lattice heating up to a temperature of e@xmath43/4 ( and the appearance of a background in the pc spectra ) , however",
    ", here the electron gas of the conduction electrons should remain cold preventing a smearing of the pc spectra whereas the local ho 4@xmath14 moments might be affected due to a strong enough magnetoelastic coupling @xcite .",
    "we suppose that such a `` heating '' by nonequilibrium phonons suppresses the magnetic order .",
    "the destruction of the antiferromagnetic order in honi@xmath1b@xmath1c leads to a sharp increase of the resistivity at @xmath72 ( see , e.g. , fig.3 in ref .  ) , which manifests itself in the pc spectra as a peak - like feature .",
    "indeed , the position of the peak around 2.5 mev ( see fig.[hof4 ] ) corresponds to the temperature e@xmath79 7k @xmath80 .      for the n - c - s metallic junctions ( here",
    "n denotes a normal metal , c is the constriction and s is a superconductor ) under consideration also the sc energy gap @xmath81 can be investigated ( see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter 3.7 ) .",
    "the sc gap manifests itself in the @xmath48 characteristic of a n - c - s contact as pronounced minima around @xmath82 at a temperature well below t@xmath83 .",
    "such @xmath48 curves are presented in fig.[hodt ] . using the btk equations @xcite to fit @xmath48 , the sc gap @xmath81 and its temperature dependence",
    "are established ( see fig.[hodt ] ) .",
    "it is seen that @xmath84 has a bcs - type dependence , however the temperature where the gap vanishes t@xmath855.6k is well below t@xmath868.5k of the bulk crystal , i.e. , the gap disappears close to t@xmath24 .",
    "similar observation of a gap which vanishes at few kelvin below t@xmath83 were presented in @xcite both for poly- and single crystals of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors supposed a gapless state between t@xmath87 and t@xmath83 based on the observation of an abrupt suppression of sc features in @xmath48 when crossing t@xmath87 and the failure of a btk fit above t@xmath87 @xcite .",
    "note , that in the mentioned temperature range honi@xmath1b@xmath1c exhibits @xcite a specific magnetic spiral structure .",
    "according to @xcite the helical magnetic order weakens the superconductivity and even nonmagnetic impurities do suppress superconductivity in systems with coexisting superconductivity and antiferromagnetism @xcite .",

    "this observation together with analogous data for @xmath81 from @xcite both for poly- and single honi@xmath1b@xmath1c crystals demonstrates at least a small gap anisotropy and a reasonable physical meaning of t@xmath87 .",
    "therefore we adopt the  fermi surface separation ",
    "scenario for the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in magnetic borocarbides , i.e.  their coexistence on different fermi surface sheets ( fss ) , proposed in refs.@xcite .",
    "in other words , we suggest that the superconductivity in the commensurate antiferromagnetic phase survives only at a special ( nearly isotropic ) fss with no admixture of ho 5 @xmath34 states .",
    "the latter mediate the magnetic exchange interaction between the localized ho 4@xmath14 moments and a part of the delocalized conduction electrons for which a standard @xmath13-wave superconductivity is easily to be destroyed or strongly suppressed .",
    "such a magnetic link between the ho 4@xmath14 moments provided by conduction electrons is necessary for the rkky interactions to explain the observed magnetic orderings at relative high temperatures . in order to proceed with a semi - quantitative analysis of our pc data",
    ", we may now adopt the well understood standard isotropic single band ( isb ) model to analyse the residual superconductivity . from the measured gap value @xmath90=0.95 mev and the estimated @xmath91 ( or the slightly different value of 5.8 k as discussed below ) remarkable strong coupling corrections",
    "can be estimated .",
    "starting for instance from a relation first derived by geilikman and kresin @xcite @xmath92 , \\label{delta}\\ ] ] one estimates a relatively low value for the logarithmically weighted phonon frequency @xmath93 10 mev . using the well - known allen - dynes expression for the critical temperature we may estimate the effective electron - boson coupling constant @xmath94 as 0.934 adopting a typical value for the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath95=0.13 .",
    "then , from the estimated upper critical field @xmath96 0.8 t one estimates in the clean limit the effective fermi velocity @xmath97 according to @xcite @xmath98=0.154\\frac{t_{c}\\left[\\mbox{k}\\right ] \\left(1+\\lambda\\right)^{1.1 } } { \\sqrt{h_{c2}(0)\\left[\\mbox{t}\\right ] } } , \\label{vfermi}\\ ] ] as a lower bound @xmath99 m / s . a similar value @xmath100 m / s follows , if @xmath1010.93 t is estimated from the slope of @xmath102 near @xmath103 using the well - known whh - relation between the former two quantities .",
    "these estimates may be helpful to elucidate which of the fss does bear the residual superconductivity . compared with the nonmagnetic borocarbides ( @xmath104 to 1.4 ) the obtained coupling",
    "constant is surprisingly less suppressed and the low value @xmath93 10 mev indicates that most of the phonon modes above 10mev shown in fig.[hof2 ] should be regarded as relevant for those nonactive fss s where the superconductivity has been extruded by the rare earth induced magnetism . since in the scenario under consideration the pairing comes mainly from the interaction with low - frequency bosonic modes , the observed peak near 10mev and its decomposition into contributions from different bosons deserves special interest . in particular , assuming that the remaining superconducting fss couples dominantly to the modes which contribute to the @xmath105 peak , a non - negligible contribution @xmath106 from the attractive interaction with crystal - field excitations ( i.e.  from the inelastic asymmetric coulomb scattering as proposed by fulde @xcite ) would be rather challenging . regarding the exact frequency values of the relevant bosonic modes , the large sensitivity of eq.([delta ] ) to the actual @xmath12 value should be stressed . in this context",
    "the rather similar values of @xmath107 , @xmath96 0.75 to 0.9 t @xcite and 2@xmath108 3.81 for dyni@xmath1b@xmath1c are noteworthy ( see ref .",

    "it is interesting to compare @xmath4 with the superconducting coupling constant @xmath126 derived above as well as with superconducting and high - temperature resistivity data which yield @xmath127 for related systems in order to understand to which extent @xmath4 probes the el - ph coupling for all bands .",
    "recent pc measurements for dyni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite and yni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite in the best junctions yield a significant larger ( smaller ) experimental coupling constant @xmath128 ( 0.1 ) , respectively , compared to the present case with @xmath129 for honi@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "however , very often the coupling constants derived from point - contact spectra should be considered as lower bounds for the coupling constants relevant for superconductivity , say @xmath130 ( 0.5 to 0.7)@xmath126 , which can be derived from different eliashberg functions @xmath131 extracted by the inversion of usual superconductor tunneling data or from an analysis of the sommerfeld constant of the linear specific heat in the normal state .",

    "can be rewritten as @xmath142 . for @xmath143 a moderate contribution of about 25% for the superconducting subsystem to the total @xmath4 follows .",
    "the latter is dominated by the quenched magnetic subsystem for honi@xmath1b@xmath1c and other magnetic borocarbides .",

    "a similar result was obtained for a specific heat analysis of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite , where the peak near 10mev was estimated to contribute about 25% to the total coupling constant of 1.2 .",

    "we addressed the specific role of selected fermi surface sheets and cef - excitations in this particular case . between t@xmath87 and the upper critical temperature t@xmath868.5k the sc signal in @xmath48",
    "is drastically suppressed , which explains the difficulties to derive the sc order parameter ( or a sc gap ) by fitting the @xmath48 data .",
