    "this paper describes an investigation of reddenings and metallicities in two fields in each of the magellanic clouds by means of strmgren ccd photometry . for the first time , the reddening variations on very small scales ( @xmath10 pc , limited by the surface density of b stars ) have been examined from strmgren photometry .",
    "a detailed analysis of the metallicities of gk giant stars is performed , with special emphasis on the problems that arise from an incomplete knowledge of the individual reddenings of the stars .",
    "the metallicities derived for gk giants from strmgren photometry are very sensitive to the assumed reddening , but because we have an estimate of the scatter in the reddening distributions from the early - type stars we are able to give quantitative estimates of the uncertainty on metallicities for individual gk giants .",
    "the disagreement in the literature on the reddening for magellanic cloud stars has been remarkably large .",
    "part of the controversy probably arises from an insufficient distinction between foreground reddening and reddening intrinsically in the clouds .",
    "grieve & madore ( @xcite ) found that some stars in the have reddenings as high as @xmath11 with an average of around @xmath12 , while the maximum for the lmc is @xmath13 and the average is @xmath14 .",
    "grieve & madore ( @xcite ) also noted that in the lmc the stars with high reddenings are predominantly concentrated in the neighbourhood of the 30 doradus complex . in a review paper , bessel ( @xcite ) concluded that while it has been claimed that the reddening is as low as @xmath15 or @xmath16 for both clouds , several investigations arrive at considerably higher reddenings , up to @xmath14 or even more . from studies of a ( fairly small ) section of the lmc , harris et al .",
    "( @xcite ) determined a mean total @xmath17 of 0.20 with a non - gaussian tail to high values .",
    "oestreicher et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and oestreicher & schmidt - kaler ( @xcite ) determined foreground reddenings and intrinsic reddenings for the , and found that the foreground reddening generally varies from @xmath18 to @xmath14 across the face of the lmc , while reddenings up to @xmath19 were seen for some of the brightest a and b supergiants .",
    "however , the extreme reddenings were interpreted as being caused by circumstellar dust shells , an assumption which was supported by the fact that for the fainter stars only more modest reddenings , up to @xmath11 , were detected .",
    "schlegel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) report typical foreground reddenings of @xmath20 ( lmc ) and 0.037 ( smc ) , respectively",
    ". using @xmath21 photometry , zaritsky  ( @xcite ) also found a dependence of reddening on spectral type , with stars hotter than @xmath22 k having visual extinctions up to several tenths of a magnitude larger than cooler stars .",
    "recently , romaniello et al .  ( @xcite ) found a mean @xmath17 of 0.20 mag around sn 1987a with a scatter of 0.072 mag , claimed to be at least twice the measurement errors .",
    "many investigations have aimed at deriving metallicities for different types of objects ( hii regions , planetary nebulae , single stars ) in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this is not the place to give an extensive review of all of them ; we refer to westerlund ( @xcite , @xcite ) . a general picture of a roughly exponential increase in metal abundance with time over the last 10 gyr is often quoted for both galaxies . from studies of the surroundings of six lmc clusters , dirsch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have determined an age - metallicity relation which shows a strong increase in the metallicity starting around 23 gyrs ago .",
    "for very young objects mean values are about @xmath23 ( lmc ) and @xmath24 ( smc ) , respectively , whereas `` canonical '' field star metallicities of around for the lmc and for the smc are often used .",
    "the strmgren @xmath25 photometric system was originally designed for the study of baf stars ( strmgren @xcite ) .",
    "it has , however , turned out to be very useful also for investigations of other types of stars .",
    "bond ( @xcite ) demonstrated that metallicities can be derived for red giants by means of the strmgren @xmath26 and @xmath27 indices . in nearby galaxies , such as the magellanic clouds ,",
    "the strmgren system thereby provides us with a potentially very powerful tool for studying the metallicities of large numbers of red field giant stars .",
    "several _ spectroscopic _ studies of cool supergiants reach the canonical metallicities and a scatter of about @xmath28 dex ( e.g. spite & spite @xcite ; olszewski et al .",
    "@xcite ; hill @xcite ) , whereas attempts to derive metallicities for red field giants from strmgren photometry ( hilker et al .",
    "@xcite ( hrg95 ) ; grebel & richtler @xcite ( gr92 ) ; dirsch et al .",
    "@xcite ) have failed to reproduce them .",
    "gr92 studied the neighbourhood of the young cluster ngc 330 in the smc and found [ fe / h ] = @xmath29 for the cluster itself , whereas the surrounding field stars had an average metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath30 with a large spread .",
    "hrg95 found [ fe / h ] = @xmath31 for ngc 330 and metallicities in the range [ fe / h ] = @xmath32 to @xmath23 for the field stars , with a peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath33 .",
    "for the red giants in the lmc cluster ngc 1866 , hrg95 found a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath34 , while the field stars also here showed a large variation in metallicity with a peak at .",
    "dirsch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) generally find metallicities lower than @xmath35 for six relatively young lmc clusters and their surrounding fields .",
    "in this paper we first derive reddenings for early - type stars in each of the four fields using new ccd strmgren photometry .",
    "metallicities are then derived for red giant stars in the same four fields , also using strmgren photometry .",
    "the uncertainties on the derived metallicities are then discussed , with particular emphasis on the scatter resulting from an inaccurate knowledge of the reddenings of individual red giant stars .",

    "[ fig : byc1 ] as described in the previous section are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcred ] .",
    "the dashed gaussians represent the average observational scatter . the lower limit of the reddening distribution is interpreted as being caused by galactic foreground extinction .",
    "we estimate that this amounts to @xmath36 in both of the lmc fields and @xmath37 in the smc fields , corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the estimated errors in these reddenings are largely due to zero - point errors in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 photometry , while errors in @xmath41 do not affect the results significantly .    for the lmc fields , we can compare the foreground reddening determinations to the reddening map by oestreicher et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which predicts foreground reddenings of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the hv12578 and hv982 fields . thus , our estimated foreground reddenings are somewhat higher and agree well with the typical value of @xmath20 reported by schlegel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . however , their typical smc value of @xmath44 is significantly lower than our results .",
    "the width of the histograms representing the reddening distributions can not be accounted for by observational uncertainties and must , consequently , represent real scatter in the reddenings of lmc / smc b stars .",
    "this could either mean that the foreground reddening varies by as much as 0.1 in @xmath17 within the fields , or that the b stars are subject to different amounts of reddening from the interstellar medium in the clouds themselves , being located at different optical depths .",
    "in the first case , we would expect that reddenings are strongly correlated with the position in the image , whereas such a correlation would be weaker or absent if the variations are caused by depth effects .",
    "of course , any intermediate scenario is in principle possible .",
    "if reddening is correlated with position then the difference between the reddenings of two neighbouring stars will , on the average , be smaller than that of two widely separated stars . in order to investigate this effect",
    ", we used our measurements of individual b star reddenings to calculate the r.m.s .",
    "reddening difference between two stars as a function of their separation in the image .",
    "we denote the r.m.s reddening difference between the reddening of a star and other stars at distances @xmath45 from it @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the bin size .",
    "we found @xmath48 pixels to be a reasonable bin size .",
    "if reddening is correlated with position on scales smaller than some characteristic limit , @xmath46 will decrease as @xmath49 becomes smaller than the characteristic limit , which could for example depend on the typical size of interstellar clouds .",
    "@xmath47 is not a very critical parameter .",
    "it should be chosen sufficiently large that a reasonable number of stars will be located within an annulus of inner radius @xmath49 and outer radius @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand , it should not be larger than the typical size of the structure we are looking for .",
    "figure [ fig : rms_eby ] shows @xmath46 for each field , with @xmath47 set to 10 pixels or roughly 4 arcseconds .",
    "there is no significant decrease in @xmath51 even for quite small @xmath49 , with a hint of such a decrease only in the smc fields ( hv1433 , hv11284 ) . at the same time ,",
    "[ fig : rms_eby ] also gives for each field an indication of how large the typical error will be if just the average reddening of the field is used as an estimate of the reddening for a given star .",
    "this varies from one field to another , from @xmath52 = 0.025 in the hv12578 field to 0.07 in the hv11284 field , and it is clear that the error is in no case negligible . based on the two fields we have observed in each galaxy , the contribution from internal reddening in the clouds appears to decrease as a function of distance to the centre .",
    "the previous section has shown a lack of correlation between reddening and position in the fields , even on the smallest scales on which this can be investigated by means of the present strmgren photometry , i.e. a few arc seconds ( for lmc and smc , 1 pc corresponds to about @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ) .",
    "many stars have reddenings much larger than the galactic foreground contribution , in some fields up to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) or so .",
    "because the reddening is not correlated with the position in the field , we conclude that the variations are most likely due to the stars being located at different depths in the magellanic clouds .",
    "therefore , the difference between the maximum and minimum reddening in each field presumably represents the total reddening when looking through the lmc or smc at the corresponding position .",
    "it is of interest to compare our results with the investigation by oestreicher & schmidt - kaler ( @xcite ) .",
    "their reddening map shows a lack of stars with high reddenings in the neighbourhood of the hv12578 field , in agreement with our results , whereas a large number of stars with relatively high reddenings are found near the 30 dor region , again in agreement with our results .",
    "oestreicher & schmidt - kaler ( @xcite ) did not study the small magellanic cloud .",
    "olsen ( @xcite ) only found strong differential reddening in one out of four lmc fields observed with the hst , centered on the cluster ngc  1916 near the centre of the lmc bar .    as we shall see in the following section , the fact that average reddenings are only accurate to within several hundreths of a magnitude is potentially a serious problem for photometric studies of stars where reddenings can not be directly determined , such as metallicity studies of gk giants in the strmgren system ( hilker et al .",

    "compared to an earlier calibration of [ fe / h ] as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath27 by grebel & richtler ( @xcite ) , the hilker ( @xcite ) calibration yields somewhat lower metallicities , especially at low metallicities .",
    "the difference amounts to about 0.1 dex for [ fe / h]@xmath87 and increases to @xmath88 dex for [ fe / h]@xmath89 .    for a `` typical '' gk giant with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , errors in @xmath92 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 of 0.01 magnitudes",
    "correspond to a total error in the derived metallicity of about 0.16 dex , with the most significant contribution to the total error arising from the @xmath39 band error .",
    "similarly , an error in the estimated reddening @xmath52 of 0.01 mag translates to about 0.05 dex in the derived [ fe / h ] .",
    "hence , the derived metallicities are quite sensitive to errors in the measurements as well as in the assumed reddenings , and great care must be taken to avoid systematic errors which may shift the observed metallicity distributions by significant amounts .    in this section",
    "we analyze the metallicity distributions derived for gk giants using the calibration given by eq .",

    "the effect of cn anomaly on metallicities derived from strmgren photometry has also been illustrated by richter et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath86 metallicity calibration is valid only for subsolar metallicities .",
    "we therefore can not conclude with certainty from our data that stars with truly high metallicities exist in the lmc or smc , while the possibility remains open .",
    "spectroscopic studies will be needed in order to answer this question definitively .",
    "average , median and mode statistics for the metallicity distributions are listed in table  [ tab : metstat ] , with numbers in parantheses based on [ fe / h ] values less than 0 .",
    "the smc fields generally come out more metal poor than the lmc fields , although the smc hv11284 field appears to be nearly as metal - rich as the lmc hv12578 field .",
    "however , the uncertainty on the photometric zero - points translates to roughly 0.2 dex in [ fe / h ] , so within the error limits the metallicities are consistent with the results from spectroscopic studies of f and g supergiants , for the lmc and for the smc ( westerlund @xcite ) .",
    "our metallicities for the lmc fields are also consistent with those obtained by dirsch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who quote [ fe / h ] values in the range @xmath98 to @xmath99 dex for young lmc clusters .      with the knowledge of reddenings obtained from b stars , it is possible to estimate how much of the apparent scatter in metallicity seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : metal ] may actually be attributed to reddening variations .    in order to investigate",
    "how reddening variations affect the derived metallicity distributions , we carried out the following experiment : first , a set of @xmath100 data pairs were generated , corresponding to one single metallicity ( the canonical values were used for this experiment ) .",
    "this was accomplished by using the list of observed @xmath77 indices and then generating the @xmath78 indices from the calibration equation . when plotted in the @xmath100",
    "diagram these points would then per definition fall along straight lines .",
    "next , for each @xmath101 data pair the reddening of a randomly selected b stars was added .",
    "the `` metallicities '' were then determined for these synthetic data using an _ average _ reddening , in the same way as for the real gk giants .",
    "this lead to the histograms drawn with dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : metal ] .",
    "the peaks of the simulated metallicity distributions are in quite good agreement with those of the actual observed distributions , at least to within the uncertainty arising from zero - point errors in the photometry .",
    "the scatter in the observed metallicity distributions remains somewhat larger than that of the simulated ones , and in particular , we note the presence of what might be interpreted as a metal - poor population , with metallicities extending down to [ fe / h ] @xmath8 . in order to quantify to",
    "what extent some of the scatter in the metallicity distributions may be intrinsic , we compared the observed and simulated distributions using an f  test ( press et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "for all the fields , the hypothesis that the variances of the two distributions are similar is rejected at a very high ( @xmath102% ) confidence level .",
    "this remains true even if the analysis is restricted to data with [ fe / h]@xmath103 , except for the hv11284 field where no statistically significant difference is now found between the variances of the observed and simulated metallicity distributions .",
    "it is instructive to consider what happens when one tries to compare e.g. the metallicity of cluster stars and the metallicity of surrounding field star populations : the cluster stars will all be located at the same depth in the lmc or smc , so they will all be affected by the same amount of interstellar absorption . on the other hand ,",
    "the field stars will be randomly distributed radially , and therefore their reddenings will vary accordingly . when metallicities are derived using strmgren photometry one will indeed be able to confirm that the cluster stars all have the same metallicity , seemingly proving that the strmgren photometry `` works '' , while the field stars will seem to occupy a wide range in metallicity . however , a significant amount of the scatter in the metallicities derived for the field stars may not be real , but is instead due to differences in the reddening from star to star .",
    "any observed difference between the average field star metallicity and the cluster metallicity may be partly real , but will also depend on the amount of reddening internally in the smc or lmc to which the cluster is subject .    for lmc / smc clusters that are sufficiently young for early - type stars to be present it may be worthwhile to consider including @xmath104 band observations in future strmgren photometry so that reddenings can be determined .",
    "with the new generation of uv - sensitive ccd chips this will not be very costly in terms of observing time .",
    "independent age determinations for the metal - poor stars in our sample could provide insight into the age - metallicity relation for field stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "such a relation is relatively well established for _ clusters _",
    "( e.g. van den bergh @xcite ) , but the situation for field stars is more uncertain due to the inherent difficulties in obtaining independent metallicities and ages . here",
    "we will not attempt to derive age information for gk giants , but we note that dirsch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) attempted to determine an age - metallicity relation and the star formation history of both red giant field stars and clusters in their six lmc fields , using strmgren @xmath7 photometry .",
    "they found evidence for an increase in the star formation rate @xmath105 gyr ago , along with a rapid enrichment .",
    "however , the results remain uncertain because of possible cn anomalies in the lmc gk giants and the problems discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : ieor ] .",
    "based on extensive strmgren @xmath0 photometry we have investigated four @xmath106 ccd fields , two in the lmc and two in the smc . because @xmath104-band observations were included it has been possible to study reddening variations on very small ( @xmath10 pc ) scales .    from b stars we find that reddenings vary by several hundreths of a magnitude in @xmath17 within a ccd field .",
    "the reddening variations are random rather than smooth , so unless the reddening for a particular object is directly measured it will be uncertain by at least 0.035 mag in @xmath17 ( hv  12578 field ) and up to 0.10 mag ( hv  11284 field ) .",
    "this translates directly into metallicity errors for red giants of 0.15 dex and 0.45 dex respectively , unless individual reddenings are available .",
    "we thus suggest that the @xmath104 filter be included in lmc / smc strmgren photometry whenever possible .",
    "in particular , metallicity studies of young star clusters with a suitable number of b stars for reddening determinations would benefit strongly from the inclusion of @xmath107band data .",
    "metallicities have been derived for gk giants . within the @xmath1080.2 dex uncertainties ,",
    "the average metallicities are largely consistent with those derived from spectroscopic studies of f and g supergiants , about for the lmc and for the smc ( westerlund @xcite ) , but we also see indications that a smaller number of more metal - poor stars with metallicities down to are present in each of the fields .",
    "there are also hints of stars with higher metallicities , but this might be an effect of chemical peculiarities such as enhanced cno abundances which are known to affect metallicities derived for red giants by means of strmgren photometry in galactic globular clusters ( dickens et al .",
    "@xcite ; richter et al .",
    "further follow - up spectroscopic studies are needed .",
    "an unexpected byproduct of this study is the peculiar location of some early - type stars in the @xmath109,[c_1]$ ] diagram .",
    "comparison with stellar models shows that this may be partly due to the lower - metallicity environments in the lmc and smc , combined with the effect of random photometric errors",
    ". however , spectroscopy of some of the stars with peculiar indices would be highly desirable in order to check if the early - type stars in the lmc / smc show other physical differences with respect to stars in the solar neighbourhood .",

    "<S> in addition to the foreground reddening we find contributions from reddening intrinsically in the clouds up to @xmath3 . the intrinsic contribution is not correlated with position within our @xmath4 ccd fields but varies in an essentially random way . unless the reddening is measured for a particular object </S>",

    "<S> the strmgren @xmath7 photometry has been used to derive metallicities for gk giant stars in the observed fields . adopting average reddenings we obtain mean metallicities which are consistent with those found from spectroscopic studies of f and g supergiants ( westerlund @xcite ) , but with a considerable scatter in the derived metallicities , from [ fe / h ] @xmath8 to [ fe / h ] @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> a significant fraction of the scatter is , however , due to reddening variations rather than being intrinsic . </S>",
