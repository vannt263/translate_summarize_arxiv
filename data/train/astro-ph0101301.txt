    "the earliest surveys of the sky above 100 mev were carried out by the cos - b satellite , which detected @xmath0-rays from 3c 273 @xcite , the first extragalactic @xmath0-ray source . at the time egret",
    "was launched in 1991 , 3c 273 was the only extragalactic source known to emit @xmath0-rays .",
    "the subject of @xmath0-ray blazars got its first dramatic boost after the egret detection of several high energy @xmath0-ray blazars @xcite .",
    "egret discovered two remarkable characteristics of these sources : ( 1 ) in the majority of the blazars , the @xmath0-ray emission dominates the bolometric power in the spectral energy distributions of these objects , and ( 2 ) blazars are characterized by short - time scale variabilities , often on the order of days to months .",
    "almost all the active galaxies detected by egret belong to the blazar - class of objects .",
    "although the term `` blazar '' is not well - defined , it includes ovv quasars , bl lac objects , and high polarization quasars ( hpqs ) .",
    "these sources are characterized by emissions that include high radio and optical polarizations , strong variability at all wavelengths , and non - thermal , continuum spectra .",
    "blazars detected by egret are radio - loud , flat - spectrum radio sources , with radio spectral indices @xmath4 for a flux density of @xmath5 .",
    "several blazars have been observed to exhibit apparent superluminal motion ( 3c 279 , 3c 273 , 3c 454.3 , pks 0528 + 134 , for example @xcite ) , as evidenced from vlbi radio observations .",
    "egret observations of blazars are summarized in section i.    three of the egret blazars ( mrk 421 , mrk 501 , pks 2155 - 304 ) have now been detected at tev energies ( @xmath3 gev ) by ground - based atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) @xcite .",
    "these results have reinvigorated the @xmath0-ray studies of blazars and have opened a new chapter in high energy astrophysics . as new acts with lower energy thresholds ( @xmath6 gev )",
    "become operational @xcite , the high energy @xmath0-ray studies of blazars will be conducted from the ground before the next generation satellite - based experiments like glast @xcite or agile @xcite come on line .",
    "the future of high energy @xmath0-ray blazar studies looks very promising . some of the egret blazars observed at tev energies are described in section ii .",
    "egret observations of blazars have helped constrain models of @xmath0-ray emission mechanisms in these objects .",
    "the combination of high luminosity , short - term variability , and superluminal motion observed in blazars all bolster arguments for relativistic beaming in these objects .",
    "this is in agreement with the strong association of egret blazars with radio - loud flat - spectrum radio sources , with many of them showing superluminal motion in their jets .",
    "most blazar models adopt a beaming paradigm .",
    "egret observations of blazars have enabled us to test several competing blazar emission models , most of which can be divided into two broad classes : `` leptonic '' and `` hadronic . ''",
    "it is generally believed that the broadband spectral energy distribution of blazars is due to energy losses of highly energetic particles via both synchrotron and compton processes .",
    "a summary of the current blazar models and their implications , as pertaining to egret sources , is given in section iii .",
    "the possible contributions of blazars to the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray background are discussed in section iv .",
    "this article presents a snap shot of the current knowledge on egret - detected @xmath0-ray blazars and selectively reviews some of the interesting highlights of the field .",
    "a comprehensive review is not possible , owing to the limited number of the allotted pages . instead",
    ", the reader is referred to several recent articles which serve as excellent introductions to the exciting field of @xmath0-ray blazars detected by egret @xcite .",
    "this article reviews the blazars listed in the third egret ( 3eg ) catalog @xcite .",
    "these blazars were typically observed by egret for a period of about 2 weeks .",
    "some observations were as short as 1 week , while others were as long as 3 to 5 weeks .",
    "egret s threshold sensitivity ( @xmath7 mev ) for a single 2-week observation was @xmath8 photons @xmath9 s@xmath2 .",
    "details of the egret instrument , and data analysis techniques are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "of the 271 sources detected by egret above 100 mev , 67 are blazars detected with a high degree of confidence ( a detection of at least a @xmath10 statistical significance at high galactic latitudes , and a @xmath11 detection for @xmath12 @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , 27 other blazars are classified in the 3eg catalog as possible agn @xcite .",
    "this is because their identification is questionable , either because the candidate source has a low radio flux , or lies outside the 95% error contour of the egret source .",
    "this makes blazars the second - largest class of egret sources , following the `` unidentified '' sources that have no known counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "egret has detected blazars with redshifts ranging from @xmath13 0.03 to 2.28 .",
    "the majority of the blazars detected by egret are classified as flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "the 46 fsrqs with strong identifications , listed in the 3eg catalog , are shown in table 1 .",
    "of these , 0440 - 003 , cta 102 , and 3c 454.3 are not strictly `` flat - spectrum '' in the range between 1.4 and 5 ghz , or 2.7 and 8 ghz .",
    "the bl lac objects detected by egret are listed in table 2 .",
    "not included in the table is mrk 501 , which is discussed in section ii .",
    "the bl lac objects are characterized by stronger polarization and weaker optical lines than fsrqs , which makes redshift determination more difficult .",
    "other differences between fsrqs and bl lac objects are discussed in the following sections .",
    "not listed in either table are four flat - spectrum radio sources 0616 - 116 , 0738 + 545 , 1759 - 396 , and 1908 - 201 , also detected by egret .",
    "in addition , egret has detected @xmath0-ray emission from cen a , a radio galaxy , the only one seen to emit @xmath0-rays @xcite .",

    "pks 0528 + 134 is one of the most variable sources detected by egret .",
    "a dramatic flare was seen from the source in 1993 march when its flux was several times greater than that of the crab @xcite .",
    "the flux variability of the blazars can be quantified by assigning a `` variability index , '' @xmath140 , where @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath142 is the probability of observing @xmath143 or something larger from a @xmath143 distribution with @xmath144 degrees of freedom .",

    "figure  [ fluxhist ] shows a distribution of the variability indices of the fsrqs and bl lac objects listed in tables 1 and 2 .",

    "nearly 75% of all fsrqs may be classified as variable . in comparison ,",
    "most of the unidentified egret sources are found to be non - variable , although recent studies have found short time scale variability in a few unidentified egret sources @xcite .",
    "although the study of short time scale variability is limited for most blazars by the small number of photons detected by egret during a single observation period , some egret blazars have been observed to flare dramatically on the time scale of days .",
    "for example , pks 1622 - 297 exhibited a major flare during the observation in 1995 .",
    "a flux increase by a factor of at least 3.6 was observed in a period of less than 7 hours @xcite .",
    "the peak flux observed was @xmath149 @xmath9 s@xmath2 ( @xmath150 mev ) , which corresponded to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath151 ergs s@xmath2@xcite .",

    "the doubling time was less than 3.8 hr .",
    "a dramatic flare was also observed in the blazar 3c 279 , in which the doubling time was @xmath152 hours @xcite .",
    "other blazars that have shown strong variability on timescales of 1 to 3 days in the past are pks 0528 + 134 , 3c 454.3 , pks 1633 + 382 , 1406 - 076 , and cta26 .",
    "studies of fast variations of @xmath0-ray emission in blazars using structure function analysis techniques have also been carried out for a few selected sources @xcite .",
    "the study of short time scale variability in blazars is important as they help to constrain the size of emission regions in these objects . a flux variation by a factor of two on an observed time scale @xmath153 limits the size @xmath154 of the emitting region to roughly @xmath155 using simple light travel time arguments",

    "in order to decipher the underlying physics of the emission mechanisms in blazars , it is essential to study the broad band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these sources .",
    "since egret first started detecting blazars , several multiwavelength campaigns have been organized to simultaneously observe these sources at different wavelengths ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . although these campaigns have proven difficult to organize , and the seds of blazars are often non - simultaneous or under - sampled , they have helped constrain blazars models .",

    "six high energy photons ( @xmath163 gev ) were observed from the direction of mrk 501 in a 1-day interval , when the probability for this happening by chance was @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "a power - law fit to the egret data suggested a spectral index of @xmath165 for mrk 501 , and is the hardest known blazar spectrum at gev energies @xcite .",

    "unlike in fsrqs , the @xmath0-ray peak in the sed of this high - frequency - peaked bl lac ( hbl ) no longer dominates the spectrum , although it plays a very important part .",
    "the synchrotron peak of mrk 501 is located in the x - ray band , while the compton peak is in the gev - tev regime .",
    "in fact , a correlation between the peak frequencies of the synchrotron and ic components of the sed and the total energy density of the emitting region has been noted previously @xcite . there appears to be evidence for a well - defined sequence in the properties of different blazar classes , namely , hbl , lbl ( low frequency - peaked bl lacs ) , hpq ( high - polarization quasars ) , and lpq ( low - polarization quasars ) .",
    "the trends in the observed properties are a decrease in frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks , and an increase in the power - ratio of the high and low energy spectral components along the sequence hbl @xmath166 lbl @xmath166 hpq @xmath166 lpq .    at a redshift of 0.031 ,",
    "mrk 421 is the closest xbl seen by egret , and the first one to be detected by ground - based acts @xcite .",
    "although it is a rather weak source at gev energies , it has been persistently detected by egret @xcite . above 30 mev",
    "the source has a very hard photon spectral index of @xmath167 , and has a high energy peak in its sed at tev energies .",
    "it is generally believed that blazars are powered by accretion of matter on to a supermassive black hole , and that @xmath0-ray emission originates in strongly beamed jets .",
    "the absence of intrinsic @xmath168 pair absorption in the observed blazar spectra strongly points to the fact that @xmath0-ray emission is beamed radiation from the jet .",
    "a review of the constraints placed on agn models from the @xmath0-ray observations may be found in @xcite .",
    "leptonic jet models explain the radio to uv continuum from blazars as synchrotron radiation from high energy electrons in a relativistically outflowing jet which has been ejected from an accreting supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "the emission in the mev - gev range is believed to be due to the inverse compton scattering of low - energy photons by the same relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "however , two main issues remain questionable : the source of the soft photons that are inverse compton scattered , and the structure of the inner jet , which can not be imaged directly .",
    "the soft photons can originate as synchrotron emission from within the jet ( the _ synchrotron - self - compton _ or ssc process ) , or from a nearby accretion disk , or they can be disk radiation reprocessed in broad - emission - line clouds ( the _ external radiation compton _ or the erc process ) . a review on leptonic jet models and the relevant references may be found in @xcite .    recently , mukherjee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have applied a leptonic jet model to the sed of pks 0528 + 134 observed by egret from 1991 to 1997 @xcite .",
    "a combination of ssc and erc models was used . a two - component model , in which the target photons are produced externally to the @xmath0-ray emitting region , but also including an ssc component ,",
    "was required to suitably reproduce the spectral energy distributions of the source .",
    "the analysis indicated that there is a trend in the observed properties of pks 0528 + 134 , as the source goes from a @xmath0-ray low state to a flaring state .",
    "the model fits presented in @xcite indicated that during the higher @xmath0-ray states , the bulk lorentz factor of the jet increased and the erc component dominated the high - energy emission .",
    "the energies of the electrons giving rise to the synchrotron peak decreased , and the power - ratio of the @xmath0-ray and low energy spectral components increased , as the source went from a low to a high @xmath0-ray state .    in figure  [ 0528 ] the fit results to two extreme states of pks 0528 + 134 from @xcite are compared . during the 1993 march observations , pks 0528 + 134 was in its highest state ever , while the 1997 february data correspond to one of the lowest states of the source during the egret observations .",
    "the source exhibits considerable spectral variability between different epochs , a characteristic typical of many fsrqs observed by egret .",
    "the model calculations of the sed of pks 0528 + 134 yielded a shift of the synchrotron peak frequency towards lower frequencies in a @xmath0-ray bright state of the source , as has been predicted analytically @xcite .",
    "the spectral variability in pks 0528 + 134 appears to arise from the different doppler boosting patterns of the ssc and the erc radiations .",
    "the relative contributions of the ssc and erc cooling mechanisms seem to be related to the optical to @xmath0-ray flux ratio from the source .",
    "the ssc mechanism plays a larger role if the source is in a low flux state .",
    "the erc mechanism is the dominant cooling mechanism when the source is in a high @xmath0-ray state .",
    "bttcher @xcite has demonstrated that the predicted peak shift is characteristic of a leptonic jet model in which the @xmath0-ray emission is dominated by the erc process during @xmath0-ray flares , but does not depend on the physical details of such a model .",
    "this is particularly important , as the seds of most blazars are still quite poorly constrained observationally , and can in many cases be fitted equally well with several fundamentally different models .",
    "a similar analysis was recently performed for the multi - epoch seds of 3c 279 @xcite , where the same general trend in the seds were observed as in the case of pks 0528 + 134 .",
    "in contrast to leptonic jet models where the jet consists of a hot @xmath169 plasma , in hadronic models the observed @xmath0-ray emission is initiated by hot protons interacting with ambient gas or low - frequency radiation . in the _",
    "proton induced cascade _ ( pic ) model",
    "@xcite the relativistic protons interact electromagnetically and hadronically , i.e. through photo - pion production , with low frequency synchrotron radiation .",
    "such a model would require extremely high luminosity in high energy protons in order to explain the observed tev @xmath0-ray fluxes in blazars .",
    "in contrast , in the _ synchrotron proton blazar _",
    "models @xcite , the high energy emission in the blazars detected at tev energies is attributed to synchrotron radiation of extremely high energy protons . in such models ,",
    "synchrotron radiation becomes the dominant energy loss mechanism of the high energy protons .",
    "_ synchrotron proton blazar _ models have recently been applied to the case of the egret blazars mrk 501 and mrk 421 @xcite .",
    "the precise origin of the extragalactic diffuse emission is not well - known and possibly includes contributions from diffuse origins as well as unresolved point sources .",
    "recently , the evolution and luminosity function of the egret blazars was used to estimate the contribution to the diffuse extragalactic background @xcite .",
    "it was found that the evolution was consistent with a pure luminosity evolution .",
    "the redshift distribution of egret blazars was used to characterize the low end of the luminosity function better .",
    "the high end of the luminosity function was fixed by a non - parametric estimate @xcite . using the lower limit of the de - evolved luminosity function ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray loud agn contribution to the extragalactic @xmath0-ray flux was estimated to be @xmath170 photons",
    "@xmath9 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 .",
    "the sky - averaged flux contribution of identified egret blazars is @xmath171 photons @xmath9 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 .",
    "contribution to the diffuse background by unresolved blazars , therefore , was found to be @xmath172 photons",
    "@xmath9 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 .",
    "the estimated extragalactic diffuse flux for @xmath173 mev is @xmath174 photons",
    "@xmath9 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these calculations indicate that blazars can not account for all of the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray background at the energies considered . under this scenario , only @xmath13 25% of the diffuse extragalactic emission measured by sas-2 and egret can be attributed to unresolved @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "these findings are consistent with other studies @xcite , and contrary to estimates which assume a linear correlation between the measured radio and @xmath0-ray fluxes and attribute a much larger contribution by blazars to the @xmath0-ray background ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these results lead to the exciting conclusion that other sources of diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray emission must exist .",
    "during its lifetime egret detected more than 67 blazars at energies above 100 mev .",
    "this has been one of the most remarkable contributions from the mission .",
    "only a handful of the egret sources have been detected with ground - based acts at energies above 250 gev , although most of them have been observed @xcite .",
    "this indicates that spectral changes must exist in the unexplored range between 50 and 250 gev , possibly due to intrinsic absorption at the source or due to @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production off the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) @xcite . in the future",
    ", it will be important to complement blazar studies by space - based experiments such as agile or glast , with ground - based instruments sensitive to the energy range 50 to 250 gev .",
    "ground - based instruments like stacee and celeste with energy thresholds lower than 250 gev are currently operational and well - suited to the study of several northern hemisphere agn",
    ". other experiments like veritas , hess , magic and cangaroo iii will soon come online . a review of these experiments , and",
