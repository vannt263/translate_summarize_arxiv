    "carbon - based materials ( diamond and in - plane graphite ) display the highest measured thermal conductivity of any known material at moderate temperatures @xcite .",
    "the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 @xcite has led to speculation that this new material could have a thermal conductivity greater than that of diamond and graphite [ 3 ] .",
    "carbon nanotube has found a lot of application in electronic and mechanical devices .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that the material has received a lot of attention over the past decade [ 4 - 11 ] .",
    "the thermal conductivity of materials in general is partitioned into charge carriers ( i.e. , electron or hole ) component @xmath2 which depends on the electronic band structure , electron scattering and electron - phonon interaction , and lattice component @xmath3 which depends mainly on phonon and phonon scattering . in dielectrics ,",
    "@xmath4 while in metals the reverse is the case . in semiconductors ,",
    "the value of the thermal conductivity @xmath5 is strongly dependent on the composition of the semiconductor , and the value of @xmath6 is generally greater than the value of @xmath7 .",
    "so far , most publications on the thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes have paid attention to only the lattice thermal conductivity and completely neglected electron thermal conductivity .",
    "hone et al .",
    "@xcite found that the conductivity of carbon nanotubes was temperature dependent , and was almost a linear relationship .",
    "they suggested that the conductivity decreases smoothly with temperature , and displays linear temperature dependence below 30 k. however , berber et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the graph of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity looked less linear and that it shows a positive slope from low temperatures up to 100 k where it peaks around 37000 w / mk .",
    "then , the thermal conductivity drops dramatically down to around 3000 w / mk when the temperature approaches 400 k. similar relationship has been found by mensah et al .",
    "@xcite for electron thermal conductivity @xmath7 .",
    "mensah et al .",
    "@xcite have also studied the electron thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes .",
    "they observed that the temperature dependence of @xmath7 in carbon nanotubes is similar to that obtained by berber et al . and that @xmath7 peaks at unusually high values .",
    "they further observed the dependence of @xmath7 on the geometric chiral angle @xmath8 , temperature t , the real overlapping integrals for jumps along the tubular axis @xmath9 and the base helix @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , they again noted that varying these parameters could give rise to unusual high electron thermal conductivity whose peak values shift towards higher temperatures .",
    "for example , at @xmath11 ev and @xmath12 ev . the peak value of @xmath7 occurs at 104k and is about 41000 w / mk which compares well with that reported for a 99.9% isotropically enriched 12c diamond crystal . in this work",
    ", we will use the approach in @xcite to investigate theoretically the laser stimulated thermal conductivity in chiral cnts . in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of laser on the thermal conductivity of chiral carbon nanotube .",
    "we observed that the laser has drastic effect on the electron thermal conductivity .",
    "it drastically reduced the thermal conductivity i.e. about 10 times .",
    "it also causes @xmath5 to oscillate with the amplitude of the laser source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section one deal with the introduction ; in section two , we establish the theory and solutions ; results obtained will be discussed in section three and finally we draw our conclusions",
