    "confined polymer chains show up in many sectors ranging from filtration problems to dna permeation  @xcite . in good solvent conditions ,",
    "the concentration of linear chains in a pore smaller than the coil size , in equilibrium with a dilute bulk solution , is exponentially small  @xcite .",
    "however , the chain may be sucked in the pore by a flow ( with an overall current @xmath1 ) if the current is beyond a certain threshold given by  @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the solvent viscosity and @xmath4 is the thermal energy . note that this critical current is independent of both the molecular weight of the chains and the capillary size .",
    "ten years ago , some of us tried to extend this discussion to the case of branched chains  @xcite .",
    "the hope was that the threshold current could bring new informations on the properties of branched objects .",
    "it turns out , however , that our discussion was incorrect !",
    "the purpose of the present letter is to improve on that .",
    "the incorrect result was based on an  inside approach \" , where the confined chain is considered independently of the entry .",
    "the implicit assumption was that the structure of a partly sucked chain may be represented by that of a completely confined chain .",
    "below , after recalling some basic conformational principles of branched polymers , we summarize the earlier argument and show its weakness .",
    "we then present a flory type argument for a partly sucked branched chain and discuss the progressive nature of the confining process .",
    "we start with a branched polymer made up of @xmath5 monomers of size @xmath6 , in solution in a good solvent .",
    "we assume the molecule to be flexible , and characterized by a tree - like structure with no loops .",
    "the ideal size ( _ i.e. _ the size without volume interactions ) of such an object is given by @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the chain swelling due to excluded volume interactions can be derived using a flory type argument as follows  @xcite .",
    "the free energy of the branched chain with size @xmath8 is @xmath9 the first term is an elastic term , and the second term comes from the intermonomer repulsions . minimizing eq.([flory1 ] ) with respect to @xmath8 yields the equilibrium size of the chain : @xmath10",
    "when such a branched object is confined into a capillary of size @xmath11 , its conformational properties are significantlly altered  @xcite and the chain is extended over a length @xmath12 along the capillary axis .",
    "the flory free energy of the chain is now given by : @xmath13 minimizing eq.([flory2 ] ) with respect to @xmath12 yields : @xmath14 the confined branched object is reminiscent of semidilute solutions and can be seen as a compact stacking of blobs of size @xmath15 with a number of monomers @xmath16  @xcite . inside a blob ,",
    "the effect of confinement is negligible , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are related by @xmath17 ( see eq.([r_branch ] ) ) .",
    "since the blobs are compactly stacked , @xmath15 and @xmath16 must also satisfy the relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the volume fraction given by @xmath20 . from the above equations we obtain for the mesh size @xmath21 for @xmath22",
    ", we have @xmath23 .",
    "note also that @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( this latter value is called the _ minimum diameter _  @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the earlier `` inside approach '' for the flow injection of branched polymers  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the situation in which part of the polymer chain is located inside a pore of diameter @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 , see fig .",
    "[ process_old ] ) ) .",
    "[ previous_approach ]    the length of the pore occupied by the chain is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the free energy , @xmath31 , associated with the confined part of the chain is given by @xmath32 in the above equation , the force due to the confinement is @xmath33 the hydrodynamic force @xmath34 can be estimated as a stokes drag per blob .",
    "assuming that @xmath30 is larger than the blob size , we get @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the local solvent velocity inside the capillary and @xmath37 is the number of blobs injected . the free energy eq.([f_y ] ) can thus be rewritten as @xmath38 if one assumes that @xmath15 is identical to the equilibrium mesh size of a chain entirely confined into the capillary , then @xmath15 is independent of @xmath30 and eq.([f_y_order ] ) indicates the existence of a barrier in the free energy @xmath39 located at @xmath40 if @xmath41 is smaller than the thermal energy @xmath42 , the injection process takes place . therefore , the critical current @xmath0 for a branched polymer is predicted to be given by  @xcite : @xmath43 using eq.([xi ] ) , eq.([j_c_previous ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath44 which indicates that the larger branched polymer would be injected into smaller pore with more difficulties .",
    "equation  ( [ j_c_previous ] ) , ( [ j_c_previous_branch ] ) were the main predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , but they are incorrect for the following reason",
    ". the threshold length @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath46 is given by ( see eqs.([y_barrier],[j_c_previous ] ) ) @xmath47 equation.([y_c_j_c ] ) indicates that @xmath48 .",
    "but at @xmath49 , the polymer does not feel yet the effect of the confinement at all !",
    "this contradiction clearly indicates that the assumption that @xmath15 is identical to the equilibrium mesh size of an entirely confined chain is incorrect .",
    "as we will now show , the mesh size @xmath15 depends in fact on the degree of penetration , @xmath30 , and can be calculated based on a flory method for a _ finite _ piece of chain .",
    "we now focus our attention to the suction process . the statistical properties of a partly sucked branched object can be discribed based on a flory type of calculation .",
    "the procedure is the same as the case for the completely confined chain , except for the point that now only a part of the chain ( with the number of monomers @xmath50 ) is inside the capillary .",
    "the sucked part of the chain is extended over a length @xmath30 along the tube and its degree of extension can be derived from the optimization of the following free energy .",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 is the size of an ideal branched chain made from @xmath53 monomers . minimizing eq .",
    "( [ flory2 ] ) with respect to @xmath30 , we obtain @xmath54 the correlation length for the confined section is calculated in an analogious way . for a partly sucked branched chain",
    ", we obtain the @xmath30 dependent mesh size @xmath55 all these results , of course , coincide with the case of completely confined chain by replacing @xmath53 with @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to note that the mesh size @xmath56 is a decreasing function of @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the branched object is progressively compressed during the confinement process ( fig .  [ branch_tube ] ) .    with progressive confining in mind",
    ", we now return to our discussion of suction process .",
    "we may still use the  inside \" discription of eq .",
    "( [ f_y])-([f_hydro ] ) . using the @xmath30 dependent mesh size eq .",
    "( [ xi_y ] ) , we arrive at @xmath57 the above free energy display an energy barrier of height @xmath41 , located at @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and@xmath60 at the threshold , @xmath61 , therefore we arrive at a remarkable result @xmath62 in contrast to eq.([y_c_j_c ] ) , the corrected value of @xmath45 ( eq.([y_barrier_jc ] ) ) is now comparable to the value of @xmath15 at the entrance of the pore and eq .",
    "( [ f_y])-([f_hydro ] ) are therefore meaningful . from eq .",
    "( [ y_barrier_new ] ) and ( [ y_barrier_jc ] ) , we find that the critical current @xmath0 for branched chains is still given by the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ j_c_linear ] ) : we expect no dramatic difference between branched chains and linear chains .",
    "we have shown that the scaling structure of the critical current for penetration , @xmath0 , is the same for branched and linear chains .",
    "though suprizing , this result can be explained physically .",
    "our argument indicates that the crucial moment is the insertion of a _ single blob _ of the capillary size .",
    "we might ask whether more resistance comes out from the second , third blob ...    the crucial physical feature is a runaway : starting from one blob , if we go to higher value of @xmath30 , the hydrodynamic drag increases faster with @xmath30 than the confinement force . this can be checked in detail starting from eqs .",
    "( [ f_y ] - [ f_hydro ] ) , and allowing @xmath63 to depend on @xmath30 ( eq .",
    "( [ xi_y ] ) ) .",
    "such a feature is associated with the progressive nature of the confining process of branched objects into the capillary ( fig .",
    "[ branch_tube ] ) .",
    "thus , as soon as one blob has entered the capillary , the whole structure should get sucked in .    from a practical point of view",
    ", we now expect that @xmath0 is not sensitive to branching ( except for numerical coefficients which go beyond scaling ) .",
    "our hope of probing branched structure by suction experiments is thus destroyed .",
    "however , for more complicated structures ( stars , nanogels ) , the suction process may be interesting .",
    "this is discussed in a separated paper by one of us ( t.s . ) ."
