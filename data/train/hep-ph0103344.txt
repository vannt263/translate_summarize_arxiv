    "photoproduction of photons with large transverse momentum , @xmath0 , in @xmath1 collisions , @xmath2 , is an important test of pqcd . in particular",
    "it allows to probe the photonic content of the photon  @xcite .",
    "this process , called also the prompt photon photoproduction or the deep inelastic compton ( dic ) scattering , was measured at the hera collider by the zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite collaborations . in this note",
    "we compare the potential of the thera and hera colliders in measuring the dic process .",
    "the predictions of nlo qcd calculations for the photoproduction of _ non - isolated _ prompt photon at hera and thera energies are presented .    in the present experimental analyses of the prompt photon production at hera",
    "the hadronic energy detected close to the final photon has been restricted , and therefore one can say that the final photon is _ isolated_. the nlo calculations for the dic process with isolated photon at the hera collider  @xcite give reasonably good description of the zeus data for the @xmath3 distribution  @xcite . for the rapidity distribution the results are in good agreement with data at rapidities @xmath4 , however they lie below data at rapidities @xmath5 ( the difference is @xmath6 30% )  @xcite . for comparison with results for",
    "non - isolated photon discussed in this paper , we present also our predictions for isolated photon at hera together with the zeus data  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the photoproduction in the @xmath1 collision can be calculated using the equivalent photon approximation  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is ( in the laboratory frame ) a fraction of the initial electron energy taken by the photon .",
    "the ( real ) photon distribution in the electron we take in the form : @xmath9\\!-\\!{2\\over y}(1-y -{m_e^2y^2\\over q^2_{max}})\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 being the electron mass , and @xmath11 = 1 gev@xmath12 ( used both for the hera and thera collider )    we consider now the production of a large-@xmath3 photon in the @xmath13 scattering .",
    "the lowest order ( born ) contribution to the cross section comes from the compton process on the quark , @xmath14 . in the nlo calculation one",
    "takes into account @xmath15 corrections to the born process : the virtual gluon exchange and real gluon emission , together with the subprocess @xmath16 .",
    "the collinear singularities , which appear in these corrections , are subtracted and shifted into corresponding parton densities or fragmentation function .",
    "the remaining corrections , without singularities , constitute the so called k - factor .",
    "the initial photon may interact directly with the parton from the proton ( as in the born process ) or may interact as the resolved one via its partons .",
    "analogously , the observed final photon arise directly from hard partonic subprocesses ( as in the born process ) or arise from fragmentation processes in which @xmath17 or @xmath18 decays into @xmath19 .",
    "the nlo cross section for the photon production in @xmath20 collision can therefore be written in the following form  @xcite , while e.g. in  @xcite they are assumed to be of order @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to different set of subprocesses included in nlo calculations in both approaches . ] : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) stands for the photon ( proton ) momentum fraction taken by the @xmath25 ( @xmath26)-parton , and @xmath27 is the momentum fraction of the @xmath28-parton fragmenting into photon .",
    "the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the parton densities in the photon , parton densities in the proton and parton fragmentation into photon , respectively .",
    "the first and the second term in eq .  ( [ born ] ) correspond to the born contribution and to the k - factor , respectively .",
    "the three terms ( [ init ] , [ final ] , [ double ] ) are due to various resolved photon subprocesses , with resolved initial or / and final photon .",
    "the last term ( [ box ] ) stands for the contribution of the box diagram , @xmath32 .",
    "the box diagram is of nnlo - type ( as it is the double resolved photon processes ) , nevertheless we take it into account in our nlo calculation , because it is known that they give a sizable contributions , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we present nlo qcd results for the dic cross section at hera and thera energies .",
    "for thera we assume @xmath33 = 250 gev and @xmath34 = 920 gev . for hera",
    "we take @xmath33 = 27.5 gev and @xmath34 = 820 gev   used in the zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite measurements .",
    "the grv nlo parametrizations for the parton distributions in the proton  @xcite and photon  @xcite , and parton fragmentation into photon  @xcite are used . the renormalization / factorization scale",
    "is assumed equal to the transverse momentum of the final photon , @xmath35 .",
    "the calculations are performed for four massless quarks , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 = 320 mev .",
    "0.cm-2cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpt ] the cross section @xmath38 is presented for @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 .",
    "the results strongly depend on @xmath3 : the cross section decreases by three orders of magnitude when the @xmath3 increases from 4 to 20 gev .",
    "the predictions for the thera collider are larger than for hera , 3.5 to 5.5 times for @xmath3 from 4 to 20 gev .",
    "note that the isolation and additional cuts applied by the zeus group  @xcite at hera reduce the cross section by a factor of 10 ( 4 ) at @xmath41 ( 20 ) gev .",
    "the cross section @xmath42 for @xmath43 gev is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dn ] .",
    "the range of accessible rapidities is extended and the value of the cross section is much higher for the thera collider in comparison with predictions for hera . in the central rapidity region , @xmath44 , ( where the zeus data  @xcite are shown )",
    "the results obtained for thera are @xmath6 2 - 5.5 times larger than for hera .    0.cm-2cm",
    "we have presented results of nlo calculation for the non - isolated prompt photon photoproduction at the thera and hera colliders .",
    "the predictions for thera are a few times larger than for hera in a wide range of transverse momentum and rapidities .",
    "this can allow to perform much more precise measurements than the present ones and e.g. in testing the parton densities in the photon . for a comparison",
    "the current data and predictions for isolated photon at hera are also shown .",
