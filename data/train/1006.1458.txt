    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is the leading candidate for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it not only solves the gauge hierarchy problem , but also provides a dynamical mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking and a natural candidate for the dark matter .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) has attracted much phenomenological and theoretical interest but it suffers from the so - called little hierarchy problem and the @xmath5 problem .    an extension with an extra singlet superfield , known as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite was motivated to provide a natural solution to the @xmath5 problem .",
    "the @xmath5 parameter in the term @xmath6 of the superpotential of the mssm naturally has its value at either @xmath7 or zero ( due to a symmetry ) .",
    "however , the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking conditions require the @xmath5 parameter to be of the same order as the @xmath8-boson mass for fine - tuning reasons .",
    "such a conflict was coined as the @xmath5 problem  @xcite . in the nmssm ,",
    "the @xmath5 term is generated dynamically through the vacuum - expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath9 , of the scalar component of the additional higgs field @xmath10 , which is naturally of the order of the susy - breaking scale .",
    "thus , an effective @xmath5 parameter of the order of the electroweak scale is generated .",
    "the nmssm was recently revived because it was shown that it can effectively relieve the little hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "because of the additional higgs singlet field and an approximate peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry , the nmssm naturally has a light pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath11 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , in most parameter space that is natural , the sm - like higgs boson can decay into a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons with a branching ratio larger than @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the branching ratio of the sm - like higgs boson into @xmath13 would be less than @xmath14 and so the lepii bound is effectively reduced to around 100 gev @xcite . since the major decay modes of the higgs boson are no longer @xmath13 , unusual search modes have been investigated @xcite .    in susy models ,",
    "cp - violating phases naturally appear in the @xmath5 term of the superpotential and in the soft - susy breaking terms .",
    "the nonobservation of electric dipole moments ( edms ) for thallium  @xcite , neutron  @xcite , and mercury  @xcite is known to constrain cp - violating phases very tightly .",
    "nevertheless , cancellations among various contributions may occur among several contributions to the three measured edms , thus still allowing sizable cp phases  @xcite .",
    "in the mssm , the nonvanishing cp phases could radiatively induce significant mixing between the cp - even and cp - odd states  @xcite , giving rise to a number of interesting cp - violating phenomena and substantial modifications to higgs - boson phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the lightest higgs boson can be as light as a few gev with almost vanishing couplings to the weak gauge bosons when the cp - violating phases are maximal .",
    "the decay patterns of the heavier higgs bosons become much more complicated compared to the cp - conserving case because of the loss of its cp parities  @xcite .",
    "these combined features make the higgs boson - searches at lep difficult ; consequently , the higgs boson lighter than @xmath15 50 gev can survive the lep limit  @xcite . in this work , we study the nmssm higgs sector with cp violation . in the cp - conserving limit ,",
    "the neutral higgs sector in the nmssm includes two cp - odd and three cp - even states . with cp violation",
    "the 5 neutral higgs bosons lose their cp parities and all mix together .",
    "we anticipate a whole new set of phenomena associated with the singlet extension of the mssm in the presence of nontrivial cp - violating phases in the vevs , and the @xmath5 and soft susy - breaking parameters . as the first step toward this new extension , we calculate the whole mass spectrum of the higgs sector as well as the couplings to the vector gauge bosons , which will dictate the production and decay patterns of the higgs bosons .",
    "phenomenology associated with the cp - violating nmssm higgs sector will be performed in future works .",
    "we list a few possible directions at the end of the conclusions .",
    "we include in this calculation the important corrections to the higgs spectrum in order to have more precise comparisons to current experimental limits : ( i ) full one - loop corrections to the higgs - boson masses , and ( ii ) logarithmically enhanced two - loop corrections of order @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the renormalization - group ( rg ) improvement and minimization of the two - loop corrections .",
    "we also impose highly desirable conditions to limit the parameter space : ( i ) the lep limits on the higgs - boson mass and the chargino mass limit , ( ii ) the global minimum condition  the local minimum that we obtain is indeed the global minimum , and ( iii ) the positivity of the square of the higgs - boson masses .",
    "we found that the rg - improved corrections have significant reduction in the allowed parameter space with respect to the lep limits , the global minimum condition , and the positivity of the higgs - mass squared .",
    "before we close this section let us list the parameters of this study .",
    "we have ( i ) the usual soft parameters in the mssm : sfermion masses , @xmath18 parameters , soft higgs - boson masses , and @xmath19 ; ( ii ) the additional parameters arisen in nmssm : @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the superpotential , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the soft - breaking sector , and the vev @xmath9 of the singlet higgs field ; ( iii ) the cp phases of @xmath18 parameters , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the vevs ( but not all independent ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we write down the formalism in details in the next section , including minimization conditions , combinations of cp phases , tree - level mass matrices , and mixing between scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the full one - loop and logarithmically enhanced two - loop corrections using the rg - improved approach . numerical presentation for a number of interesting scenarios will be demonstrated in sec .",
    "iv , including comparisons to the previous results in literature where possible . we conclude and discuss our results in sec .",
    "to begin with , we first introduce the nmssm superpotential : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the singlet higgs superfield , @xmath26 are the two su(2)@xmath27 doublet higgs superfields , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the matter doublet and singlet superfields , respectively , related to up- and down - type quarks and charged leptons .",

    "( [ eq : cpoddtad ] ) .",

    "substantial corrections to the higgs - boson spectrum , mixing , and couplings to weak gauge bosons are realized , furthermore , nontrivial variations in the mass spectrum , mixing , and couplings appear due to nonzero cp phases .",
    "therefore , we anticipate a whole new set of phenomenology associated within this cp - violating nmssm framework .",
    "it is well known that the experimental measured edms place nontrivial constraint on the cp phases . with one more physical cp phase added in this nmssm framework the predictions for edms are important to constrain the combinations of phases @xcite .",
    "such cp phases are also important to provide enough cp violation required in the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "3 .   a successful supersymmetry model should be able to explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , which is widely accepted as a @xmath350 effect @xcite .",
    "the cp - violating nmssm considered in this work should also be constrained so as to satisfy the muon anomaly .",
    "it is a nontrivial extension in this regard because of the presence of many new higgs bosons , which can be very light and with cp violating couplings .",
    "there are a number of low - energy constraints on the lightest cp - odd higgs boson in the cp - conserving nmssm @xcite .",
    "the exercises can be repeated in the presence of the new cp phases .",
    "there are a number of important cubic terms in the higgs potential , which also have nontrivial dependence on the higgs spectrum and cp phases .",
    "specifically , for successful baryogenesis , the soft cubic term involving the singlet field @xmath351 , which is absent in the mssm , is vital to enable a first - order phase transition when the stops are heavy .",
    "apparently , from the ewbg - motivated scenario studied in this work , a first - order phase transition is possible in this framework .",
    "we will delay this issue to a detailed study in the future @xcite 6 .",
    "a whole new set of phenomenology has to be explored in the higgs sector with 5 neutral higgs bosons with no definite cp parities , and a pair of charged higgs bosons .",
    "as we can see in this work , the couplings to weak gauge bosons vary nontrivially with the cp phases .",
    "the same can be said for the mass spectrum .",
    "it is more complicated than the cp - violating mssm or cp - conserving nmssm . at this point",
    ", we can not forecast how the decay branching ratios and production will be modified .",
    "we delay this to a further study .",
    "7 .   with cp violation",
    "there is no explicit cp property for the higgs bosons . in most of the cases ,",
    "there are three relatively light neutral higgs bosons and two relatively heavy ones .",
    "the collider phenomenology is particularly concerned with the three lighter ones , in which one of them is the sm - like higgs boson with a relatively large coupling to the gauge bosons than the other two higgs bosons ( but still the strength is a fraction of the sm value . ) at the tevatron , the most useful higgs production channel is via the associated production with a @xmath352 or a @xmath8 boson .",
    "the production rate of the sm - like higgs boson is smaller than the corresponding sm higgs boson , but it may be possible to produce more than one higgs boson . at the lhc , on the other hand , production is dominated by the gluon fusion . the crucial strategies for higgs - boson search depend on the decay pattern of the higgs bosons",
    "there are a number of possible channels that the sm - like higgs boson can decay into , including the dominant @xmath13 , @xmath353 , the rare ones @xmath354 , @xmath355 , and the possible new ones @xmath356 , @xmath357 , and @xmath358 depending on the mass spectrum . in the cp - conserving nmssm , the sm - like higgs boson can decay into 2 cp - even lighter higgs bosons or 2 cp - odd higgs bosons , but not a mixture .",
    "now with cp violation , the sm - like higgs boson can decay into @xmath359 , which is not possible in the cp - conserving case .",
    "it is a clean signal of cp violation .",
    "further decays of @xmath360 and @xmath361 will give a total of four fermions in the final state , e.g. , @xmath362 , @xmath363 , @xmath364 , @xmath365 , @xmath366 , @xmath367 , etc .",
    "feasibility and coverage of parameter space certainly deserve further studies .",
    "we conclude by summarizing that we have started a new avenue in the cp - violating nmssm , which involves a whole new set of phenomenology in low - energy precision measurements , in the lhc higgs - boson searches , baryogenesis , etc .",

    "<S> we perform a comprehensive study of the higgs sector in the framework of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model with cp - violating parameters in the superpotential and in the soft - supersymmetry - breaking sector . since the cp is no longer a good symmetry , the two cp - odd and the three cp - even higgs bosons of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model in the cp - conserving limit will mix . </S>",
    "<S> we show explicitly how the mass spectrum and couplings to gauge bosons of the various higgs bosons change when the cp - violating phases take on nonzero values . </S>",
    "<S> we include full one - loop and the logarithmically enhanced two - loop effects employing the renormalization - group ( rg ) improved approach . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the lep limits , the global minimum condition , and the positivity of the square of the higgs - boson mass have been imposed . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the effects on the higgs - mass spectrum and the couplings to gauge bosons with and without the rg - improved corrections . </S>",
    "<S> substantial modifications to the allowed parameter space happen because of the changes to the higgs - boson spectrum and their couplings with the rg - improved corrections . finally , we calculate the mass spectrum and couplings of the few selected scenarios and compare to the previous results in literature where possible </S>",
    "<S> ; in particular , we illustrate a scenario motivated by electroweak baryogenesis .    </S>",
