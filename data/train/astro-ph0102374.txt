    "based on current observational evidence , swarms of globular clusters ( gcs ) appear to surround virtually all large galaxies and quite a few lesser ones .",
    "in particular , it was noted early on that large elliptical galaxies like e.g.  m87 are hosts to exceedingly rich gc populations @xcite . before the advent of sensitive ccd detectors in the early 1980s",
    ", studies of gcs in galaxies beyond the local group remained very demanding , but over the past couple of decades an impressive amount of photometric data has been collected for globular clusters ( gcs ) in external galaxies .",
    "further progress has been made with data from the _ hubble space telescope _ , reducing contamination to a minimum because of its superior resolution .",
    "studies of extragalactic gcs have often aimed at characterizing the properties of all gcs around any given galaxy as a _ system _ and comparing these with the gc system of our own and other galaxies . since gcs",
    "are generally thought to have formed very early , it has been anticipated that similarities and/or differences between gcss in various galaxy types would eventually contribute to an improved understanding of the formation and early evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "perhaps the most celebrated of the similarities between gcss in different galaxies is the apparently `` universal '' _ luminosity function _ of globular clusters .",
    "when plotted in magnitude units , the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) in practically all galaxies studied to date appears to be quite well fit by a gaussian with a mean or `` turn - over '' at @xmath4 and a dispersion of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , few studies have reached deeper than @xmath7 mag below the turn - over and there have been plenty of attempts to fit gaussians to even shallower data .",
    "it is also worth noting that there is no _ a priori _ reason to prefer a gaussian as a fitting function . in the few galaxies where the luminosity distribution of globular clusters is known to several magnitudes fainter than the turn - over",
    ", other analytic functions actually provide a better fit .",
    "@xcite found that in the milky way and m31 , a @xmath2 function is a significant improvement compared to a gaussian .",
    "although the difference between a gaussian and a @xmath2 function is relatively minor when plotted in the standard magnitude space , it turns out to be very conspicuous when the lfs are plotted in _ luminosity _ units ( sect .",
    "[ sec : lf_an ] ) .    in recent years , hst observations have revealed extremely luminous _ young _ star clusters in starburst environments . for any reasonable m / l ratios ,",
    "these young clusters have masses that are easily within the range spanned by typical old globular clusters , and it is tempting to assume that the study of such clusters may tell a great deal about how the old gcs formed . the luminosity functions of young clusters generally follow power - law distributions of the form @xmath8 . for young clusters in the `` antennae '' , @xcite found an overall lf slope of @xmath9 above @xmath10 and @xmath11 below this limit .",
    "however , @xcite found that the _ mass _ function of antennae clusters is well represented by a power law with exponent @xmath12 over the entire mass range @xmath13 .",
    "for young clusters in the recent merger ngc  3256 , @xcite found a power - law with exponent @xmath14 to be a good fit to the lf , and similar power - laws have been fitted to the lfs of massive young clusters in starburst galaxies like he 210 ( @xmath15 ) and ngc  1741 ( @xmath16 ) @xcite . for milky way open clusters @xcite and young clusters in the lmc @xcite , the lf",
    "is well represented by a power law with @xmath17 .",
    "however , when evolutionary effects are taken into account the slope of the _ mass _ function may be closer to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the mass / luminosity functions for a variety of other young objects ( e.g.  hii regions and giant molecular clouds ) are generally well represented by similar power - laws @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the fact that lfs of old globular clusters have traditionally been discussed as a function of _ magnitude _ , while studies of young cluster systems often use linear luminosity units , makes direct comparison of the lfs of young and old clusters more difficult .",
    "this has sometimes led to the misconception that the lfs of young and old clusters are dramatically different .",
    "however , the _ upper _ part of the lf of old gcs and the lf of young clusters are , in fact , well represented by power - laws with very similar exponents .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite found power - laws with a slope of @xmath16 to be a good fit to the mass function for old gcs brighter than the turn - over in the two ellipticals , ngc  4636 and ngc  720 .",
    "important clues to the formation of old gcs may lie in the similarity of their lf to that of young objects rather than in the differences , which become apparent mainly for luminosities _",
    "fainter than _ the gclf turn - over .",
    "furthermore , little is actually known about the detailed behavior of the faint end of the gclf , and in particular , whether the shape of the lf is really universal at the faintest levels in old as well as young cluster systems .",
    "another important result concerns the _ color _ distribution of old gcs .",
    "one of the more striking recent discoveries has been that of _ bimodal color distributions _ for gc systems @xcite .",
    "this was originally predicted by @xcite as a consequence of gas - rich mergers . in their scenario ,",
    "a merger product would contain a metal - poor ( blue ) gc population inherited from the progenitor galaxies and a metal - rich ( red ) population , formed in the merging process .",
    "after the initial excitement about the discovery of bimodal color distributions it has become clear that not all observed properties of gc systems fit into the merger picture and alternatives have been suggested @xcite .",
    "it is probably fair to say that there is currently no consensus concerning theories for the origin of multiple globular cluster populations within galaxies @xcite , but bimodal color distributions have turned out to be very common @xcite and understanding them is bound to provide insight into processes that must have been common in the evolutionary history of galaxies .    in spite of the often - quoted strong evidence in favor of the `` universal '' gclf , there may be some reason to question its universality .",
    "in a recent study of the nearby s0 galaxy ngc  1023 , @xcite found a number of clusters with much larger effective radii ( about 10 pc ) than normal gcs .",
    "interestingly , these clusters were also _",
    "fainter _ and did not fit a `` standard '' gclf .",
    "it is also well - known that the outer , more extended halo clusters in the milky way are generally fainter and do not share the standard gclf @xcite .",
    "this underscores the need to explore the _ faint _ end of the gclf and test whether it is truly universal .",
    "combining the photometric data with information about the sizes of individual globular clusters may provide further clues to the origin of gc systems , e.g.  in order to check whether the faint extended clusters in ngc  1023 are a common phenomenon , or if they are unique to this galaxy and therefore presumably formed in some rare event .    in the milky way",
    ", globular clusters typically have half - light ( effective ) radii of about 3 pc ( harris 1996 ) although clusters in the outer halo are significantly larger @xcite . at the distance of the nearest large galaxy clusters ( virgo and fornax )",
    ", this corresponds to about @xmath18 , so whether these gc sizes are typical in other galaxies remained completely unknown until the hst era .",
    "sizes of gcs beyond the local group have now been measured in a number of galaxies and it appears that gcs in other galaxies have roughly the same sizes as in the milky way .",
    "more surprisingly , it appears that the _ red _ gcs are generally somewhat smaller than the _ blue _ ones by 20 ",
    "30% @xcite . whether this difference was set up at formation or is due to dynamical evolution remains an open question .",
    "the hst archive now contains images of more than 50 early - type galaxies and thus provides an invaluable database for studying and comparing gcss around different galaxies .",
    "such surveys have already been undertaken by other authors @xcite and we do not intend to duplicate their efforts here .",
    "however , the previous studies have put their main emphasis on a comparison of as many gcss as possible , not necessarily requiring homogeneity in depth and/or choice of bandpasses . here",
    "we aim at a more specific investigation of relatively nearby galaxies for which _ deep _ hst wfpc2 imaging is available in the f555w and f814w bands , which can be accurately transformed to standard @xmath3 and @xmath19 magnitudes .",
    "most of the data were obtained in cycles 5 and 6 by our group , where much of the cycle 6 data is published for the first time in this paper .",
    "we have supplemented our data with archive data , but only data with exposure times comparable to those of our cycle 5/6 datasets have been included in order to reach well beyond the gclf turn - over and provide sufficient s / n for size measurements .",
    "we have also obtained photometry for objects in two comparison fields as a check of background / foreground contamination .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the student s @xmath2 function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the turn - over magnitude and @xmath22 is the dispersion of the @xmath2 function , provides a significantly better fit to the milky way and m31 gclfs than a gaussian .",
    "this is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gclf_mw ] which shows the milky way gclf together with a gaussian and a @xmath2 function , both with a mean of @xmath23 and dispersions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 function evidently provides a better fit than the gaussian , particularly at the faint end .",
    "however , if one restricts the fit to clusters brighter than @xmath26 mag below the turn - over , as in most studies of extragalactic gcss , the difference remains quite subtle .",
    "the difference between the gaussian and the @xmath2 function becomes much more clear when plotting the number of clusters per _ luminosity _ bin rather than per _ magnitude _ bin , as illustrated in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gclf_mw ] . in luminosity units",
    ", a log - normal distribution is actually quite far from providing a satisfactory fit below @xmath27 or @xmath28 , while the @xmath2 function does , in fact , match the observed luminosity function almost perfectly .",
    "normalizing the two functions to the same value at the turn - over , the difference between the @xmath2 function and the gaussian amounts to a factor of 4 at @xmath29 and increases rapidly below this limit , reaching a factor of 30 at @xmath30 .",
    "so although the difference between a gaussian and a @xmath2 function is almost indiscernible for typical extragalactic gc data , it becomes quite significant at faint levels .",
    "this difference may turn out to be of great relevance to the understanding of dynamical destruction processes in gc systems , as a @xmath2like distribution requires considerably fewer low - mass clusters to be destroyed for an initially uniform power - law mass distribution .",
    "in addition to gaussian and @xmath2 functions , other analytical models have been used to fit the mass- and luminosity functions of globular clusters as well .",
    "@xcite used gauss - hermite expansions to characterize the galactic gclf but found the higher - order terms to be small , indicating no strong deviations from a pure gaussian .",
    "@xcite preferred a composite of two exponentials over gaussian or @xmath31 functions as a fit to the combined lf of milky way and m31 globular clusters , corresponding to two power - law segments if luminosity units are used instead of magnitudes .",
    "a figure comparing the gaussian , @xmath2 and exponential functions is given in that paper .",
    "two - component power - law fits were also used by @xcite to fit the mass distribution of old globular clusters , and there is some evidence that the highest - mass clusters may follow a third power - law mass distribution @xcite .",
    "basic data for the galaxies studied in this paper are listed in table  [ tab : gdata ] .",
    "the first column of the table gives the galaxy name .",
    "some galaxies have two or more pointings , usually with one pointing centered on the galaxy nucleus and another one offset from the center , denoted by a -o suffix .",
    "the second column of table  [ tab : gdata ] gives the name of the original principal investigator ( pi ) of the dataset , along with the i d ( pid ) of the proposal from which the data originate .",
    "exposure times in sec in f555w and f814w are in cols .  3 and 4 . a number of additional host galaxy parameters are given in table  [ tab : props ] , including infrared @xmath32 colors from the 2mass survey @xcite .    in three cases",
    "we have included data which are not in the f555w / f814w bands : two galaxies in the fornax cluster ( ngc  1399 , ngc  1404 ) were observed in f450w / f814w and data for the `` sombrero '' galaxy ( m104 ) is in f547 m / f814w . while the latter is easily transformed to @xmath33 photometry , the ngc  1399 / ngc  1404 data is closer to the @xmath34 bands and will only be transformed to @xmath33 ( using transformations in @xcite ) when this is essential for comparison with the other galaxies .",
    "we have generally included galaxies for which integrations longer than about 2000 sec were available in both f555w and f814w .",
    "however , for a few nearby galaxies ( ngc  3115 , ngc  3379 , ngc  3384 and ngc  4594 ) this requirement has been relaxed . in all cases ,",
    "the exposures listed in table  [ tab : gdata ] actually consist of two or more shorter integrations .",
    "the data were downloaded from the archive at stsci and initial reductions ( flatfielding , bias subtraction etc . )",
    "were performed `` on the fly '' by the standard pipeline processing system .",
    "subsequent reductions were done with iraf and closely followed the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the individual exposures in each band were combined using the imcombine task , with the * reject * option set to * crreject * in order to eliminate cosmic ray ( cr ) hits . in most cases ,",
    "the individual exposures images were well aligned so that no shifts were required before combination , but when shifts were necessary they were applied with the imshift task .",
    "for the central pointings , a sky background subtraction was done .",
    "first , point sources were subtracted from the raw images using the ishape   algorithm @xcite .",
    "the object - subtracted images were then smoothed with a @xmath35 pixels median filter and the smoothed images were then subtracted from the original images , providing our final set of background - subtracted images for further analysis .",
    "photometry was done with the phot package within iraf .",
    "point sources were detected using the daofind task , but because of the varying s / n within the images it was necessary to impose further selection criteria in order to avoid spurious detections .",
    "this was done by measuring the noise level directly off the images in a small annulus around each object and only including objects which had a s / n higher than 3 within an aperture radius of 2 pixels in both f555w and f814w .",
    "aperture photometry for all objects in the final object lists was then obtained using the apphot task . for the background - subtracted images",
    "a fixed background level of 0 was used , while the background was measured between 30 and 50 pixels from the object in the off - center pointings .",
    "the transformation from f555w / f814w magnitudes to the standard @xmath36 system was done following the standard procedure as described in @xcite .",
    "charge - transfer efficiency corrections from @xcite were also applied , even though this correction is nearly negligible in our case because of the underlying galaxy light .",
    "we note that the recent recalibration of wfpc2 data reduced with hstphot @xcite would cause  colors to be redder by 0.02 mag compared to the holtzman et al .",
    "calibration .",
    "colors were measured in an @xmath37 pixels aperture , but because globular clusters are expected to appear as slightly extended sources in our images we decided to use a slightly larger @xmath38 pixels aperture for @xmath3 magnitudes . for colors",
    "the use of a smaller aperture is justified even for extended objects because the _ difference _ between aperture corrections in different bands is nearly independent of object size @xcite .",
    "we have adopted aperture corrections from our science aperture to the holtzman et al .",
    "@xmath39 reference apertures of @xmath40 mag and @xmath41 mag for the wf chips and @xmath42 mag and @xmath43 mag for the pc chip , respectively .",
    "these aperture corrections are derived for objects that have king profiles with an effective radius of 3 pc and @xmath44 at a distance of about 10 mpc , typical for gcs in galaxies such as ngc  1023 and ngc  3115 . at the distance of virgo ( @xmath45 mpc )",
    ", gcs will have smaller apparent sizes and our magnitudes may thus be too bright by a few times 0.01 mag .",
    "however , colors are not affected . for a thorough discussion of aperture corrections and their dependence on object size",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "in addition to the data listed in table  [ tab : gdata ] , we included two comparison fields to check contamination by foreground / background sources .",
    "one of these fields is located about @xmath46 from the galaxy ngc  1023 ( from hst proposal 6254 , pi : e. groth ) .",
    "the data for this field consist of @xmath47 sec in each of the f606w and f814w bands , i.e.  roughly as deep as our science data .",
    "the other field is the _ hubble deep field _ ( hdf )",
    "@xcite for which we combined f606w and f814w images to obtain total integration times of 6300 sec and 12900 sec in the two bands , respectively .",
    "although the transformation of f606w / f814w data to standard @xmath48 photometry is presumably less accurate than for f555w / f814w data , it should be good enough for our comparison purposes .",
    "completeness tests were carried out by adding artificial objects to the science images and redoing the photometry .",
    "500 artificial objects were added to each chip at random positions , but with required separations larger than 10 pixels in order to avoid crowding problems .",
    "the artificial objects were added to the science images using the mksynth  task @xcite , again generating the object profiles by convolution of king profiles similar to those used for the aperture corrections with the wfpc2 psf as modeled by the tinytim  program @xcite . here",
    "the king profiles were scaled according to the distances listed in table  [ tab : props ] . in principle",
    ", the completeness corrections will be color dependent , but gcs generally span a relatively narrow range in colors ( typically between @xmath49 and 1.2 ) so for these tests we assumed constant object colors of @xmath50 , which is close to the average colors of gcs .",
    "the 50% completeness limit was generally found to be between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in most cases well below the expected turn - over of the globular cluster luminosity functions .",
    "our sample consists of 17 galaxies of which 1 is classified as type sa , 4 are classified as s0 , 11 are ellipticals and 1 is a cd . in the following we give a short description of each galaxy with references to earlier work pertaining to their gc systems .",

    "if we use the fixed-@xmath22 fits in table  [ tab : mto_fix ] instead of the two - parameter fits in table  [ tab : mto_var ] and again exclude ngc  1023 and ngc  3384 , the average  value decreases slightly to 0.37 mag with a scatter of @xmath87 mag .",

    "although one may potentially obtain a better fit to the data by letting the dispersion vary , the two - parameter fits are also more sensitive to outlying data points , inaccurate contamination and/or completeness corrections etc .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the scatter in decreases when only one parameter ( the turn - over magnitude ) is fitted , and it seems reasonable to assume that the one - parameter fits yield somewhat more accurate estimates of the turn - over magnitudes , especially for the cluster - poor gc systems .",
    "this should certainly be the case if the gclf is truly universal , with a ( nearly ) constant dispersion from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "if the sample is further restricted to galaxies for which the errors ( average of positive and negative ) on  are @xmath88 mag , then we get an average @xmath89 for both one- and two - parameter fits , with a scatter of @xmath90 mag in both cases .",
    "of course , selecting the galaxies by the errors on the @xmath2 fits introduces a bias towards cluster - rich systems , which might have systematically different properties from the poorer gc systems , so whether or not the decrease in  for the error - selected sample is real is hard to tell . in any case , the average  values are quite close to the theoretical expectation for two gc populations of similar ages and mass distributions , but different metallicities .    in table",
    "[ tab : mto_fix ] we have also included @xmath2 function fits to milky way globular clusters ( from harris 1996 ) . following @xcite , we have only included clusters between 2 kpc and 35 kpc from the galactic center and with color excess @xmath91 .",
    "we exclude clusters fainter than @xmath92 , roughly corresponding to the magnitude limit in the other galaxies in our sample .",

    "it is also of interest to compare with the gc system of m31 : curiously , @xcite found that the metal - poor ( blue ) globular clusters in m31 are on average 0.36 _ fainter _ in @xmath3 than the metal - rich ( red ) ones , a difference of about the same magnitude but opposite sign compared to most other gc systems .",
    "@xcite argue against any possible selection effects as the cause of the measured gclf differences in their sample , but note that independent confirmation using a more complete and less contaminated m31 cluster catalog would be highly desirable .",
    "however , it is worth reiterating that a comparison of the gclf turn - over magnitudes for different gc populations only makes sense for strictly identical _ mass _ distributions of the various populations .",
    "establishing the mass distributions of gcs in external galaxies independently of the luminosities will be a very difficult task observationally .",
    "if the two populations did , in fact , form at different epochs in different environmental conditions , then one might indeed _ expect _ their mass functions to be different  especially considering that the mass function of clusters in present - day starbursts deviates from that of old gcs in the critical region near and below the gclf turn - over .",
    "we therefore feel that it would be premature to draw further conclusions about age differences between gc subpopulations , based only on differences in the gclf turn - over .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldf ] we show the luminosity functions for gcs in each of the 15 galaxies with @xmath94 photometry .",
    "we use luminosity units rather than magnitudes ; for this reason the familiar `` gaussian '' shape of the gclf is not apparent in the figure .",
    "the gclf turn - over magnitude of @xmath95 corresponds to about @xmath96 . for comparison",
    ", we have also included the lf for milky way globular clusters ( shown with dots ) , using data from @xcite .",

    "the contamination correction was performed _",
    "after _ completeness correction , since the hdf data are much deeper than any of our gc data .",
    "for the other comparison field we applied the contamination correction _ before _ correction for incompleteness .",
    "the hdf is somewhat richer in background galaxies than the field near ngc  1023 , while the latter is located at lower galactic latitude ( @xmath97 ) and thus presumably contains more galactic foreground stars .",
    "the difference between the two dashed curves is likely to provide a rough indicator of the accuracy by which the lfs can be determined .",
    "the average 50% completeness limits are indicated by vertical dashed lines .    in order to compare with the lfs of young cluster systems , we performed power - law fits to the lfs of our gc data in the interval @xmath98 for red and blue clusters separately , and for the combined sample ( table  [ tab : ldf_up ] ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath2 function or gaussian fits where both the dispersion and mean can vary , power - law fits to the brighter portion of the lf are completely independent of the behavior of the data below the turn - over and therefore hardly affected by completeness effects .",
    "the numbers in table  [ tab : ldf_up ] are for the raw data , i.e.  not corrected for completeness or contamination .",
    "applying these ( uncertain ) corrections changes the exponents by at most a few times 0.01 .",

    "these values are in very good agreement with those reported for a variety of _ young _ cluster systems ( see the introduction ) .",
    "the slight difference between the fits to the red and blue clusters is most likely due to the differences in the turn - over magnitudes of the two populations .",
    "there are a few galaxies in which the _ faint _ end of the lf deviates significantly from that observed in the milky way .",
    "the most striking example is ngc  1023 which exhibits a strong excess of faint clusters @xcite , readily visible by inspection of the color - magnitude diagram ( fig .",

    "nevertheless , there might be reason to suspect that the gclf is not as universal as previously thought and it would be desirable to have even deeper hst data for some of these galaxies . variations from galaxy to galaxy at the faint end of the gclf would have strong implications for theories for the formation and evolution of gc systems .",
    "the spatial resolving power of hst allows sizes of extragalactic gcs to be measured .",
    "some recent studies have shown a general trend for the red clusters to be somewhat smaller than the blue ones , both in elliptical galaxies like ngc  4472 and m87 @xcite , in s0 galaxies such as ngc  3115 and ngc  1023 @xcite and even in the sa - type galaxy m104 , the `` sombrero '' @xcite .",
    "here we discuss in some detail the size distributions of gcs in our sample of galaxies . because of the undersampling of the point spread function ( psf ) by especially the wf cameras , it is necessary to take special care in avoiding instrumental effects . here",
    "we have used the ishapealgorithm @xcite which models the cluster images as an analytic model profile convolved with the hst point - spread function , iteratively adjusting the model until the best possible match with the data is obtained .",
    "we have chosen king profiles @xcite with a concentration parameter of @xmath102 ( tidal / core radius ) for the analytic models . since the total integrated luminosity of king profiles is finite , the fwhm values measured by ishape  can easily be converted to half - light ( effective ) radii ( ) .",
    "all internal computations by the algorithm are performed on 10@xmath103 subsampled image arrays , except for a final convolution with the so - called `` diffusion kernel '' @xcite . for the size measurements we use our f555w images , for which the diffusion kernel is best understood .",
    "for the two off - center pointings in ngc  4472 and the central pointing in ngc  4365 , the individual exposures had to be shifted before combination , inevitably altering the psf and potentially causing systematic errors in the size measurements . in these cases ,",
    "sizes were therefore measured separately on each of the raw exposures and then averaged .",
    "this also allowed us to obtain an estimate of the accuracy of the size measurements , by computing the rms deviation of the difference between sizes of clusters measured on the two sets of images .",
    "this test indicates an rms scatter of about 1.0 pc for the cluster sizes measured on individual exposures ( assuming virgo distance ) down to @xmath104 .",
    "sizes measured on combined images ( either directly or by averaging two measurements ) should therefore be accurate to about 1.0 pc down to @xmath55 and in the following we adopt this magnitude limit for the size measurements .",
    "possible systematic effects in the size measurements , resulting from the choice of a particular fitting function , are discussed in @xcite .",

    "as discussed by @xcite , the s0 galaxy ngc  1023 contains a population of extended , red clusters which are generally fainter than the `` normal '' compact , globular clusters .",
    "these `` faint fuzzies '' are clearly visible in fig .",

    "a similar population of extended red objects appears to exist in ngc  3384 .",
    "apart from the generally poorer gcs of this galaxy , the appearance of its @xmath109 diagram mimics that of ngc  1023 .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : lf ] , the gclf of ngc  3384 shows an excess of faint clusters very reminiscent of that in ngc  1023 .",
    "we thus suggest that ngc  3384 is the _ second case _ of a galaxy which hosts a population of these , hitherto unknown , extended red faint clusters .",
    "unfortunately , since the `` faint fuzzies '' are generally fainter than the gclf turn - over , they are at the limit of reliable size measurements in the more distant galaxies in our sample . furthermore , their extended nature and low surface brightness make their very detection more difficult than for `` normal '' compact gcs .",
    "it is therefore difficult to tell how common such objects are and deep hst imaging of more nearby galaxies would be highly desirable .",
    "of the four galaxies in our sample where the faint extended clusters are readily detectable ( ngc  1023 , ngc  3115 , ngc  3379 and ngc  3384 ) , they are apparent in two and not detected in the other two .",

    "note that the scatter in the gc sizes is much larger in the reddest bin .",
    "interestingly , the cluster sizes decrease as a function of  for the three bluest bins , but then tend to increase somewhat again in the reddest bin . in some galaxies like ngc  1023 and ngc  3384 , this effect is possibly due to the `` faint extended '' clusters which have preferentially red colors while the cause is less obvious in other galaxies .",
    "correlations between cluster properties and distance from the center of their host galaxies can potentially provide further clues to the formation and evolution of the cluster systems . in this respect ,",
    "hst studies are generally limited by the relatively small field of view : at the distance of virgo , a wfpc2 exposure centered on the galaxy nucleus will reach out to about 8 kpc . for more distant galaxies",

    "we will carry out a `` case study '' of three cluster - rich galaxies ( ngc  4365 , ngc  4472 and ngc  4486 ) in the virgo cluster , all with more than one wfpc2 pointing .",

    "however , further out in the halo ngc  4472 shows a stronger decline in the number of red gcs @xcite .",
    "ngc  4365 actually shows a _ decrease _ in the @xmath113 ratio outwards , although a slope of 0 is nearly within the error bars .",
    "it thus appears that the colors ( and , by inference , metallicities ) of gc subpopulations are largely _ independent _ of distance from the galaxy center .",
    "any overall gradients seem to result only from a change in the mix of the subpopulations .    concerning overall size trends as a function of @xmath111 , only ngc  4365 shows a clear increase in the cluster sizes in the outermost regions .",
    "apart from this , the gc sizes appear to be fairly constant in all the galaxies , and in particular the size _ difference _ between blue and red gcs in ngc  4472 and ngc  4486 persists at all radii .",
    "this same conclusion was reached for ngc  4472 by @xcite , although they did not estimate the absolute linear size of the gcs , and by @xcite for the inner regions of ngc  4486 .    in summary ,",
    "the observable gc properties ( colors , sizes ) appear to be nearly independent of position within the galaxies , at least in the three large ellipticals studied here .",
    "any changes in the average properties of gcs result primarily from different mixtures of the two populations .",

    "a correlation between the color of the _ red _ gcs and host galaxy luminosity was already noticed by @xcite .",
    "these authors did not find any convincing correlation with the color of the _ blue _ peak but only a large scatter .",
    "@xcite used a fairly heterogeneous dataset with metallicities derived from a mixture of spectroscopy , ,  and washington photometry , which might explain why they failed to detect any correlation between the metallicity of the metal - poor gc populations and host galaxy properties . based on a larger ( but still somewhat heterogeneous ) sample",

    "@xcite found no significant correlation between @xmath124 and the color of the blue peak , but their data comfortably allow a slope similar to the one indicated in our fig .",
    "[ fig : ccplots ] .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite found the colors of both red and blue gcs to be at best weakly correlated with host galaxy luminosity .",
    "one of the more remarkable features of fig .",
    "[ fig : ccplots ] is the lack of any clear correlation between host galaxy _ colors _ and the gc colors .",
    "in _ most _ galaxies , the colors of the red gcs roughly match the  color of the galaxy halo light , but galaxy colors span a wider range than the red gc populations and several galaxies have much redder integrated   colors than the red gcs . as an illustration of this ,",
    "we have superimposed a dashed - dotted line corresponding to a 1:1 correspondance between gc and host galaxy  colors on fig .",
    "[ fig : ccplots ] .",
    "such a relation is clearly incompatible with the data . at best",
    ", we see a weak correlation between the host galaxy  color and the color of the _ red _ gc population , but a slope of 0 is within the @xmath130 errors even for this relation . since it is well - known that a relation exists between the integrated color and the luminosity of early - type galaxies ( e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is somewhat puzzling that we do not detect correlations between the gc colors and _ both _ host galaxy luminosity and color .",
    "in fact , a linear fit to the host galaxy  and @xmath121 values for the galaxies in our sample , listed in table  [ tab : props ] , yields @xmath131 .",
    "if this is combined with the slopes of @xmath132 and @xmath133 for the gc color vs.  host galaxy @xmath121 fits ( table  [ tab : ccorr ] ) then one would expect slopes of @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the gc color vs.  host galaxy   relations .",
    "for the blue peak this is actually compatible with the measured slope within the @xmath136 errors , while there is a @xmath137 discrepancy for the red peak .",
    "the main reason for this is probably that the galaxy color ",
    "luminosity relations exhibit significant scatter .",
    "for example , inspection of table  [ tab : props ] shows that ngc  4472 has very blue  and  colors for its high luminosity , while the much less luminous ngc  4473 has the _ reddest _ integrated  colors of all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "thus , globular cluster colors appear to be determined primarily by the host galaxy luminosity , rather than by whatever processes gave the field stars their colors",
    ".      the presence of a correlation between gc colors and host galaxy luminosities for both red and blue gcs would be a strong indicator that both gcs populations `` knew '' about the galaxy in which they formed .",
    "however , the lack of any obvious correlation between host galaxy  _ color _ and the gc colors potentially provides us with an equally strong clue that the cluster- and star formation histories of galaxies may have been significantly different . this should come as no surprise  as is well known , the milky way is still an actively star forming galaxy , while globular cluster formation ceased long ago in our galaxy .",
    "the discovery of bimodal color distributions in many galaxies has led various authors to speculate about formation scenarios that could create distinct gc subpopulations . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the merger model by @xcite was the first to explicitly predict bimodal colors distributions . in this model ,",
    "elliptical galaxies form by mergers of gas - rich spirals , creating the metal - rich gc population in the starburst associated with the merger .",
    "the metal - poor clusters are inherited from the progenitor galaxies . one major problem with this model , however , is the fact that spirals generally contain only few globular clusters , and that most large ellipticals are rich in both metal - rich and metal - poor gcs .",
    "gas - rich mergers might account for relatively cluster - poor ellipticals , but the exceedingly rich gc systems of galaxies like ngc  4486 and ngc  4472 are very hard to explain within the merger picture @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that the _ metal - rich _ gcs in ellipticals represent the galaxies original gcs , while the metal - poor ones have been accreted from smaller galaxies @xcite and/or formed in minor mergers .",
    "their model is able to successfully account for quite a wide variety of final metallicity distributions .",
    "a somewhat similar approach was taken by @xcite who suggested that the metal - poor gcs in ellipticals formed by accretion of gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "one remaining problem with this approach is to verify that it is actually possible to accrete the required larger numbers of gcs without accreting any appreciable number of metal - poor _ field stars _ at the same time .",
    "it is , however , still not clear how to explain the wide range in observed properties of gc color distributions .",
    "some galaxies exhibit strikingly bimodal color distributions with roughly equal numbers of blue and red gcs ( like e.g.  ngc  1404 , ngc  4649 , ngc  4472 ) , while others show a much reduced number of red gcs ( ngc  4406 ) or even just a single ( but still significantly broadened ) metal - poor component ( ngc  4365 ) , and still others appear to show a fairly continuous color distribution , spanning a range similar to that observed in the truly bimodal systems ( ngc  4552 ) .    if mergers or accretion played an important role , one might expect a dependence on environment . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] we plot the two indicators of bimodality , @xmath74(kmm ) and @xmath74(dip ) as a function of galaxy density @xcite . for @xmath74(kmm ) , a low value ( close to 0 ) indicates that a two - component fit is a major improvement relative to a one - component fit . for @xmath74(dip ) , a high value ( close to 1 ) indicates a high probability that the dataset is not unimodal .",
    "although current galaxy density is a quite crude measure of past mergers , neither of the two plots shows any significant correlation with galaxy density , suggesting that the population mixture in gc systems is mostly shaped by intrinsic processes in the galaxies .",
    "one possible signature of past mergers is kinematically distinct cores ( kdcs ) . among the galaxies in our sample , several have kdcs .",
    "however , the gc systems of these galaxies do not generally show strongly bimodal color distributions .",
    "in fact , one of these galaxies is ngc  4365 whose gc system appears to be composed almost entirely of a single metal - poor population .",
    "we also note that @xcite found no evidence for any connection between kdcs in galaxies and bimodality .",
    "both mergers and accretion processes obviously take place even at the current epoch and it is clear that the starbursts associated with these events often lead to the formation of large numbers of very luminous ( and therefore presumably massive ) star clusters .",
    "however , the question is whether they were the dominating factors shaping the properties of gc systems in large ellipticals .",
    "it is now clear that massive star clusters can form under a wide variety of circumstances @xcite and the high levels of star formation in the gas - rich environments in proto - galaxies may quite naturally have led to formation of globular clusters .",
    "the observation that the colors of _ both _ gc populations appear to correlate with host galaxy properties would be hard to explain within the accretion / merger pictures and would fit better into _ in situ_-type scenarios in which all gcs `` knew '' about the size of the final galaxy to which they would eventually belong . in order for this to be possible , the initial episodes of gc formation in giant ellipticals ( ges ) must have taken place _",
    "after _ they assembled into individual entities , although not necessarily having evolved into anything we would recognize as a ge today .",
    "such a scenario was outlined by @xcite , who further proposed that the initial episode of gc formation would be halted by the dispersion of gas by supernova explosions . a few gyrs later ,",
    "as the gas cools down and falls deeper into the potential well , star formation commences again , forming the second ( metal - rich ) generation of stars and gcs .",
    "a very similar scenario was favored by @xcite and @xcite , based on deep hst observations of the red giant branch in the nearby giant elliptical ngc  5128 .",
    "they found an extremely broad metallicity distribution function for field stars in this galaxy , extending from @xmath78}}\\sim -2 $ ] to at least solar , which was remarkably well matched by a two - component model of simple closed - box chemical evolution .",
    "one might argue that the distinction between the various formation scenarios is somewhat blurred at the earliest epochs .",
    "@xcite point out that the first generation of star formation within the halo of a proto - ge may well have proceeded within a large number of relatively distinct gaseous clumps . in a proto - galactic halo with numerous gaseous fragments , many of these fragments are bound to interact and form larger subunits .",
    "such events would share many of the characteristics of `` mergers '' , especially when two relatively large subunits collide . in some occasions",
    ", such large - scale events could lead to a major burst of gc formation in which much of the remaining gas would be consumed , forming a quite distinct second peak in the metallicity distribution as observed in e.g.  ngc  4649 .",
    "even if some characteristics of gc systems might be understood within a framework like the one outlined above , many observed properties evidently remain to be accounted for .",
    "one remaining issue is to explain the _ size _ difference between gc subpopulations .",
    "this phenomenon seems to be a quite ubiquitous one , observed in all galaxies with broad gc color distributions ( even in the milky way ! ) and at all galactocentric distances .",
    "the size differences may be either primordial , or a result of dynamical evolution .",
    "the fact that the differences exist in all galaxies and at all radii would appear to indicate a high probability that the differences are actually set up at formation .",
    "since more compact clusters presumably originated from denser proto - globular gas clouds , this may hold information about the physical condition of the gas phase and star formation processes at the time of gc formation .",
    "the physics of cluster formation is still very poorly understood , but observations of young globular - like clusters in nearby galaxies may very well hold important clues to a better understanding of this important issue . another challenge is to understand the lack of any significant correlation between host galaxy colors and gc colors .",
    "one could speculate that globular clusters form preferentially during the first , burst - like phases of major star forming episodes , while field stars continue to form in residual , enriched gas which was not used up initially in much the same way as stars are forming in the milky way today .",
    "however , a better understanding of star forming processes , particularly in the early universe , is necessary before such ideas can be put on firmer ground .",
    "using deep hst / wfpc2 data , we have performed a detailed analysis of the color , size and luminosity distributions of globular clusters in 17 nearby galaxies .",
    "the main results may be summarized as follows :    * in all but a few cases , a kmm test finds that two gaussians provide a significantly improved fit to the color distribution relative to a single gaussian .",
    "simple histograms of the color distributions or a dip test do not always confirm significant bimodality even in cases where the kmm test returns a very high confidence level for a two - component fit , but the peaks in the  color distributions found by kmm are nevertheless quite consistent even in the less obviously bimodal cases .",
    "* red gcs are generally smaller than blue gcs by typically @xmath138% .",
    "this is true also in galaxies without sharply defined bimodal color distributions and within `` sub - bins '' in color . in all galaxies ,",
    "gc sizes decrease as a function of  color in the range @xmath139 , while the sizes of the very reddest clusters ( @xmath140 ) are again larger in some galaxies .",
    "when subdividing the clusters into only two broad bins , this effect can sometimes conceal a size difference between red and blue gcs .",
    "+ the gc size difference exists not only in ellipticals and s0 galaxies , but also in the one sa galaxy ( m104 ) in our sample .",
    "perhaps even more remarkably , gcs in the _ milky way _ follow the exact same trend . * fitting @xmath2 functions to the globular cluster luminosity functions , we find that the turn - over of the blue gcs is generally brighter than that of the red ones by about 0.4 mag on the average for the full sample .",
    "this difference is slightly larger than that expected from population synthesis models if the two populations have identical mass functions , ages and stellar imfs , but different metallicities .",
    "however , if the sample is restricted to galaxies for which the error on the turn - over difference is less than 0.25 mag , then the average difference between the turn - overs of blue and red gcs is only 0.3 mag , which is very close to the 0.26 mag expected for similar ages and mass functions but different metallicities . the milky way and sombrero spiral galaxies both show a similar offset of @xmath83 mag , but",
    "curiously , in m31 the _ blue _ ( metal - poor ) gcs seem to be fainter .",
    "+ using luminosity instead of magnitude units , the upper part of the gclf ( @xmath141 ) is generally well fit by a power - law with exponent @xmath142 . thus , the mass function of old gcs brighter than the turn - over is apparently very similar to that of young cluster systems , and it seems plausible that old gcs and young clusters form by the same basic mechanism .",
    "* we have apparently detected a second case of `` faint extended '' clusters in the nearby s0-type galaxy ngc  3384 , similar to those in ngc  1023 @xcite . in the four galaxies in our sample where such objects are definitively detectable",
    ", they thus appear to exist in two .",
    "these extended clusters are generally fainter than the gclf turn - over and thus tend to raise the lower end of the gclf , making it deviate from the milky way gclf .",
    "however , most of the galaxies in our sample are too distant to tell from current data if they possess similar clusters , so it remains unknown how common such objects are .",
    "* in three cluster - rich galaxies with several pointings ( ngc  4472 , ngc  4486 , ngc  4365 ) we have examined radial trends in gc size and color .",
    "the size difference in ngc  4472 and ngc  4486 between blue and red gcs exists at all radii and we find no evidence for any correlation between either the  peak colors or gc sizes and distance from the galaxy centers in these two galaxies .",
    "ngc  4486 shows a strong increase in the relative numbers of blue and red clusters outwards . within the hst fields ,",
    "such a trend is much weaker in ngc  4472 .",
    "ngc  4365 seems to host only one ( metal - poor ) gc population with no strong color gradients , but gcs in the outermost bins do tend to be larger in this galaxy .",
    "* we have investigated correlations between the colors of gc subpopulations and host galaxy properties .",
    "both the blue and red peak  colors correlate at the @xmath1 level with host galaxy luminosity and central velocity dispersion",
    ". however , there is no evident correlation between gc colors and the colors of their host galaxies .",
    "likewise , indicators of bimodality ( kmm and dip tests ) show no correlation with surrounding galaxy density .",
    "we conclude that our data are best explained within _ in - situ _ formation scenarios in which both gc populations formed within the potential well of the proto - galaxy , possibly in multiple episodes of star formation .",

    "<S> we present a study of globular clusters ( gcs ) in 17 relatively nearby early - type galaxies , based on deep f555w and f814w images from the wide field / planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . a detailed analysis of color distributions , cluster sizes and luminosity functions is performed and compared with gcs in the milky way . in nearly all cases , a kmm test returns a high confidence level for the hypothesis that a sum of two gaussians provides a better fit to the observed color distribution than a single gaussian , although histograms of the  distribution are not always obviously bimodal . </S>",
    "<S> the blue and red peak colors returned by the kmm test are _ both _ found to correlate with absolute host galaxy @xmath0 band magnitude and central velocity dispersion ( at about the @xmath1 level ) , but we see no clear correlation with host galaxy   or  color . </S>",
    "<S> red gcs are generally smaller than blue gcs by about 20% . </S>",
    "<S> the size difference is seen at all radii and within sub - bins in  color , and exists also in the milky way and sombrero ( m104 ) spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> fitting @xmath2 functions to the luminosity functions of blue and red gc populations separately , we find that the @xmath3-band turn - over of the blue gcs is brighter than that of the red ones by about 0.3 mag on the average , as expected if the two gc populations have similar ages and mass distributions but different metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> brighter than the `` turn - over '' at @xmath4 , the luminosity functions ( lfs ) are well approximated by power - laws with an exponent of about @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the lf for young star clusters , suggesting that young and old globular clusters form by the same basic mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss scenarios for gc formation and conclude that our data appear to favor `` in - situ '' models in which all gcs in a galaxy formed after the main body of the proto - galaxy had assembled into a single potential well . </S>"
