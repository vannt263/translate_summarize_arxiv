    "in the experiment @xcite a beam of i@xmath80 molecules ( @xmath81amu ) passes two pairs of counterpropagating running - wave laser beams , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "two paths through the setup contribute to the recorded ramsey fringe pattern , as shown in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "we must include , however , a significant contribution from two further paths to the signal @xcite .",
    "their interference is washed out over the transverse velocity distribution of the molecule beam .",
    "we assume that they add an offset to the most pronounced central fringe of the ( * ) -curve in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "if all four paths contribute by roughly the same weight we must halve the offset of the central fringe in the diagram , which yields a two - path fringe visibility of @xmath82 . the passage time is determined by the @xmath83 mm length of the interferometer and the mean molecular velocity of @xmath84 m/s .",
    "this yields @xmath85 , according to equation ( 9 ) of the main text .",
    "the two atom interferometers featuring the greatest macroscopicity in fig .  2 @xcite , as well as the proposed satellite atom interferometer @xcite listed in tab",
    ".  1 , are optical mach - zehnder - type geometries , which could in principle yield close to 100% fringe contrast .",
    "we use the recorded fringe visibilities @xmath86 ( fig .  19 in @xcite ) and @xmath87 ( fig .  3 in @xcite ) , and a hypothetical value of @xmath60 for the proposal @xcite .",
    "in all three cases the interfering particles are @xmath88cs atoms , and the interrogation time is given by twice the pulse separation time @xmath89 .",
    "the respective values are @xmath90ms , 400ms , and 2000s .    in the na@xmath80 molecule interferometer @xcite the mach - zehnder geometry is realized with three material diffraction gratings .",
    "the total length of the interferometer including beam collimation is about @xmath91 m @xcite , and the molecules pass it at a mean velocity of @xmath92 m/s .",
    "this yields an interrogation time of @xmath93ms .",
    "the maximally possible contrast is limited by two factors : first , the different weights of the interference paths , which correspond to the zeroth and the first diffraction order at the first grating ; they are given by @xmath94 .",
    "second , the modulation of the interference pattern by the third grating mask ; it contributes a factor of @xmath95 to the fringe amplitude , assuming a sinusoidal fringe pattern and a grating opening fraction of 30% .",
    "the detected contrast is thus limited to below 85% .",
    "we extract a measured fringe contrast of about 30% from the inset of fig .  4 in @xcite , i.e.  @xmath96 , which leads to @xmath97 .",

    "we find @xmath109 for a measured 50% fidelity .",
    "for the hypothetical superposition experiment with an oscillating al micromembrane , as listed in table  i of the main text , we use the parameters given in @xcite .",
    "the membrane mass @xmath110pg and the mechanical frequency @xmath111mhz yield a tiny ground state amplitude of @xmath112fm . to give a good upper estimate of the macroscopicity of such an experiment we thus approximate the flexural mode of the membrane by a axial center - of - mass vibration of a homogeneous disc of thickness @xmath113 nm and radius @xmath114 m .",

    "due to the large mass @xmath30 and the small amplitude @xmath122 we may neglect the position spread @xmath13 in ( [ eqn : g1d_canti ] ) , and we may taylor - expand its fourier transform @xmath123 to lowest order in @xmath124 . with this",

    "the interference of two sodium becs observed in @xcite is modeled using a second quantization phase - space picture in @xcite .",
    "following the same line we define a second quantization form of the characteristic function , @xmath127 de broglie interference of trapped becs is observed as a fringe pattern in the time - evolved single - particle density @xmath128 for each individual run of the experiment .",
    "the fringe visibility is given by the corresponding fourier component of @xmath129 , @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes the fringe spacing .",
    "the pattern observed in each run of the experiment @xcite can be assessed in the case of non - interacting bosons by replacing the annihilation operator @xmath132 with the collective wave function @xmath133 of the two trapped condensates . a free evolution of ( [ eqn : charfunc_bec ] ) by the time @xmath57 then yields the visibility @xmath134 of the resulting interference pattern .",
    "the fringe spacing @xmath135 should be modified to account for interactions in the bec @xcite .",
    "the second quantization form of the reduced @xmath4-particle operators ( 4 ) reads as @xmath136 a straightforward calculation reveals that ( [ eqn : charfunc_bec ] ) then classicalizes at the rate @xmath137\\hat{\\chi } \\left ( x , p \\right ) \\label{eqn : bec_charfunc_class}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of a single atom .",
    "we therefore estimate the macroscopicity from equation ( 9 ) of the main text .",
    "the authors of @xcite observed about @xmath138% interference contrast in a sodium bec after a time - of - flight of @xmath139ms ; this yields @xmath140 . in the experiment @xcite the phase sensitivity of the interferometer",
    "was increased , but at an interference contrast of only 15% after 200ms , which leads to @xmath141 ( not discussed in the main text ) .",
    "modern - day experiments with multi - component becs make use of nonlinear interactions and number squeezing to increase the coherence time and the phase sensitivity employing internal atomic states @xcite .",
    "the use of such techniques in interference experiments with spatially split becs would only yield a macroscopicity @xmath55 that is comparable to single - atom interferometers .",
    "this is due to the fact that the single - particle nature of the classicalizing effect ( [ eqn : bec_charfunc_class ] ) holds irrespectively of whether nonlinear interactions modify the coherent time evolution of the condensate wave function .",
    "larger values of @xmath55 could be achieved by increasing the fringe visibility and the time - of - flight in both single - atom and bec experiments , possibly carried out in a microgravity environment .",
    "for the case of squid experiments we obtain the exclusion curve of the classicalization parameters in fig .  1 and the @xmath55-values in fig .  2 and tab .  1 by estimating the decay rate of a superposition state of macroscopically different supercurrents , i.e.  different phases across the junctions in a josephson loop .",
    "this was studied theoretically for spontaneous localization models in @xcite , whose observable consequences are a special case of the classicalizing modification discussed here @xcite",

    "the classicalization kick distribution @xmath166 must be discretized accordingly .",
    "we find that a superposition state @xmath1 of two distinct supercurrents",
    "@xmath167 and @xmath168 decays at a rate @xmath169 due to classicalization .",
    "this assumes that @xmath170 , and that the net number @xmath171 of electrons occupying different states in each superposition branch @xcite is large .",
    "the decay rate splits into two contributions .",
    "the first one is related to momentum diffusion , which requires that at least one elementary unit of momentum @xmath172 is transferred . in the continuum limit @xmath173",
    "we find @xmath174 the expression is ultimately bounded by @xmath175 in the limit of arbitrarily strong momentum kicks , when all @xmath176 conducting electrons can be transferred from one branch of the superposition to the other .",
    "it does not depend on the actual value of the supercurrents .",
    "the second contribution represents the dephasing that comes from the classicalization - induced position kicks , when no momentum redistribution of the electrons takes place , @xmath177 here , @xmath178 denotes the difference in momentum displacement of the two current branches .",
    "it is orders of magnitude smaller than the fermi momentum , and @xmath179 holds for any reasonable kick distribution @xmath180 .",
    "hence the dephasing contribution scales quadratically with the net difference in occupation of the two displaced fermi spheres , @xmath181 .",
    "while this may potentially be significant for large squid geometries , the diffusion contribution dominates in all existing real - size experiments .",
    "experimentally measured coherence times @xmath182 of such current superpositions provide an upper bound for the decay rate @xmath183 .",
    "we estimate @xmath182 by the smallest observed frequency splitting in the experiments @xcite ( @xmath184ns ) and @xcite ( @xmath185ns ) ; the authors of @xcite estimate @xmath186ns .",
    "classicalization parameters which lead to @xmath187 are then excluded by each experiment .",
    "this yields the squid curve in fig .  1 , as well as the @xmath55-values plotted in fig .  2 ;",
    "the latter are computed with the boundary condition @xmath188 , as discussed in the main text .",
    "the superconducting loop is spanned by @xmath189 m of nb in @xcite , @xmath190 m of al in @xcite , and @xmath191 m of al in @xcite .",
    "we assume the respective material cross sections as @xmath192m@xmath61 , @xmath193nm@xmath61 , and @xmath50m@xmath61 .",
    "the experiment @xcite yields a smaller macroscopicity , @xmath194 , than @xcite ( @xmath195 ) due to its smaller ring geometry .",
