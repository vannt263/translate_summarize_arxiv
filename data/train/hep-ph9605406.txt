    "the doubly - charmed decay mode of the @xmath8 meson , @xmath9 , has been the object of recent interest , since this mode makes a significant contribution to the inclusive @xmath8 semileptonic branching fraction @xcite .",
    "recently , the one - loop corrections to @xmath10 were calculated @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and found to be substantial , giving a @xmath11 enhancement to the tree level rate ( for @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is significantly larger than the corresponding @xmath13 @xmath14 correction to @xmath15 decay .",
    "when combined with the additional radiative corrections , this brings the theoretical prediction for the semileptonic branching fraction into agreement with the experimental observation , within the theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "since the typical energy released in the decay , @xmath16 ( neglecting the @xmath17 quark mass ) , is much less than @xmath18 , one might expect the relevant scale for the perturbative corrections to @xmath10 to be significantly less than @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy release in this process is so small that the assumption of local duality may not hold ; it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that deviations from duality would not show up at any finite order in the operator product expansion . however , even if the assumption of local duality does hold in this instance , this low scale would result in an even greater enhancement of this mode over the tree - level result .",
    "this is a higher order effect which requires a full two - loop calculation to address , which we have not attempted .",
    "however , in the approach of brodsky , lepage and mackenzie ( blm ) @xcite useful information may be obtained by simply calculating the @xmath19 dependent piece of the order @xmath20 contribution to the decay .",
    "this determines the contribution of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath23 is large , this term dominates the two loop result for many processes .",
    "the blm scale @xmath24 for the one - loop correction is defined as the scale at which the @xmath5 correction is absorbed in the one - loop correction .",
    "this approach has recently been used to estimate the two - loop corrections to semileptonic top , bottom and charm decays @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the @xmath5 correction to the decay @xmath10 .",
    "we will find that this term enhances the decay rate by almost as much as the one loop term , and is of the same size as the @xmath25 correction .",
    "however , as we will discuss , the @xmath5 term is not necessarily expected to dominate the remaining uncomputed two - loop corrections .    in section 2",
    "we compute the @xmath26 corrections to the mode @xmath27 .",
    "this contribution arises from strong interaction corrections to the @xmath28 vertex , and the result can be related to a piece of the @xmath10 correction by taking @xmath29 .",
    "these corrections are interesting in their own right as they give @xmath5 corrections to the ratio @xmath30 we will find that the two - loop corrections to this ratio are under control . in section 3",
    "we calculate the @xmath5 corrections to the @xmath31 vertex .",
    "we give our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the rates for @xmath33 and @xmath34 may be written as power series in @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the leading order result in @xmath37 reproduces the parton model , while to @xmath38 two unknown nonperturbative parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , arise . the ratio @xmath7 defined in eq .",
    "( [ rtau ] ) provides a potential constraint on these parameters , although the uncertainty in the measurement is currently too large for these constraints to be useful @xcite . as in the case with massless leptons",
    "@xcite the @xmath5 corrections to this process are quite large ; however , these corrections largely cancel in the ratio @xmath7 .",
    "we write the semitauonic decay of a @xmath41-quark in terms of the quark pole masses @xmath18 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath22 is the qcd @xmath46-function , and @xmath19 is the number of light quark flavors running through the vacuum polarization loops .",
    "the ellipsis denote terms @xmath47 and higher .",
    "the one - loop correction @xmath48 is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "to compute the @xmath49 term @xmath50 we follow the work of smith and voloshin @xcite and compute the @xmath51 rate with a finite gluon mass , @xmath52 . the @xmath53 correction in the true theory , @xmath54 ,",
    "can be found from this rate by performing the weighted integral @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the strong coupling defined in the @xmath57-scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , and is related to the coupling @xmath35 defined in the @xmath58 scheme by @xmath59 we have obtained a lengthy analytic expression for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the invariant mass of the lepton pair , which we have integrated numerically over @xmath62 and @xmath63 to obtain @xmath50 .",
    "since the results are very sensitive to @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we have chosen to follow the approach of refs .",

    "@xcite ; for @xmath12 one obtains @xmath82 . taking @xmath75 , this corresponds to a @xmath83 enhancement of the rate over the tree level result .",

    "the subleading log contribution @xmath88 was calculated in ref.@xcite ; for @xmath12 these authors find @xmath89 .    clearly the requirement that @xmath90 dominates the two - loop correction , implicit in the blm approach , will not hold in this process , since the non - vacuum polarization terms @xmath91 and @xmath92 are enhanced by powers of @xmath93 . separating these terms out , we may instead hope that @xmath90 dominates over @xmath94 due to the factor of @xmath23 .",
    "however , even this assumption may not hold .",
    "voloshin @xcite has shown that in the limit in which the charm is produced nearly at rest @xmath94 receives a large enhancement . for @xmath15 , in this limit the analog of @xmath94 is of order @xmath95 , whereas for @xmath1 the coloumb exchange graphs between the two slowly - moving charmed quarks give a contribution to @xmath94 of order @xmath96 . while it is not known whether this enhancement is relevant for the physical value of @xmath64 , it indicates that the @xmath5 terms need not dominate over the @xmath85 terms . nevertheless , as a first step towards understanding the size of the two - loop corrections to this process",
    ", we may calculate @xmath90 .",
    "while the complete series of leading and subleading logs has been summed to all orders @xcite , we can not consistently use these results since we are not summing all terms of @xmath97 .",

    "@xcite , @xmath98 is not a large number , and the leading log expansion does not seem to work well for nonleptonic @xmath41 decays . for example , for @xmath99 decay the subleading @xmath100 term is 2/3 the size of the leading @xmath101 term .",
    "therefore , we choose to work consistently to @xmath85 and discard the rest of the leading and subleading log terms .",
    "the neglected terms of @xmath102 and above are likely to be much smaller than the uncomputed @xmath85 corrections .    the calculation of @xmath90 is simplified due to the fact that the graphs factorize into the contribution from the upper @xmath103 vertex and the contribution from the lower @xmath104 vertex .",
    "the upper vertex contribution can be simply obtained from the corrections to @xmath27  ( by making the substitution @xmath105 ) , while the contribution from the lower vertex require an additional calculation .    for the lower vertex corrections ,",

    ", we find @xmath119 .",
    "using @xmath75 and @xmath120 , this corresponds to an 18% correction to the tree level result , almost as large as the one loop correction .",

    "note that the @xmath14 and @xmath5 corrections to the @xmath104 vertex are positive for all values of @xmath64 , while the corrections to the @xmath28 vertex are negative .",
    "the one loop corrections cancel at @xmath126 , while the @xmath5 corrections cancel at a slightly higher value of @xmath64 .",
    "in this situation the blm scale @xmath24 is not physically relevant : at the point where the one loop corrections to the vertices cancel , @xmath24 is singular , whereas at the point where the @xmath5 contributions cancel @xmath127 . in this region",
    "the blm scale for the decay width is unrelated to the blm scales that would be obtained for the upper and lower vertices individually , and does not reflect the average momentum of the gluons in the diagrams . therefore we prefer simply to present our results as a contribution to the @xmath85 correction to the decay rate .    we also note that since the leading order phase space function @xmath128 is very sensitive to the @xmath41 and @xmath129 quark masses , there is a large uncertainty in the total @xmath10 width simply due to the uncertainty in the @xmath41 and @xmath129 quark masses .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath42 are related via the @xmath130 expansion to the corresponding hadron masses , this sensitivity is really an additional hidden source of @xmath130 corrections , just as in the semileptonic decay width .",
    "this is made clear if we adopt the approach of the previous section and write @xmath64 as a series in @xmath66 . in this case , the large sensitivity to @xmath64 results in a @xmath131 correction which is as large as the leading order term , @xmath132 \\left[1 + 9.7 { \\overline{\\lambda}\\over m_b }   +    { \\cal o}\\left ( 1/m_b^2 , \\alpha_s\\right)\\right].\\ ] ] of course , one could argue that this result is misleading because we are expanding about the extreme value @xmath133 .",
    "nevertheless , the large @xmath37 correction shows the sensitivity of the width to the quark masses . working instead with pole masses and keeping @xmath18 fixed , varying @xmath64 between 0.27 and 0.32 results in a factor of two change in the total rate .",
    "it is straightforward to find the @xmath125 term for the decay @xmath134 from computations of the charmed semileptonic decay @xcite and from the results for @xmath135 @xcite . for @xmath136",
    "this gives @xmath137 \\left[1 - 0.67 { \\alpha_s ( m_b ) \\over\\pi } + 4\\ln^2 { m_w\\over m_b}\\left({\\alpha_s ( m_b ) \\over\\pi}\\right)^2\\right .",

    "we have computed the @xmath144 contributions to the rate of the nonleptonic decay @xmath10 at the parton level . while these corrections do not dominate in any formal limit of the theory , they are a well - defined subset of the complete two - loop corrections",
