    "the diffuse gamma - ray background is characterized by an isotropic or nearly isotropic distribution and is therefore known as the isotropic gamma - ray background ( igrb )  @xcite .",
    "it is constituted by gamma rays produced by various sources , including blazars , pulsars , and possible dm structures , not yet detected due to the limited angular resolution and photon statistics of the fermi - lat .",
    "figure [ marco ] shows the igrb spectrum and the estimated contributions from unresolved blazars , star - forming and radio galaxies .",
    "the angular distribution of photons in the diffuse background may contain information about the presence and the nature of these unresolved source populations .",
    "in  @xcite the first 22 months of fermi - lat data were analyzed , dividing the energy range between @xmath1 gev and @xmath3 gev in @xmath4 energy bins .",
    "the point sources in the first year catalogue @xcite have been masked , as well as the emission within a band of 30 degrees above and below the galactic plane .",
    "the masking was done to cover the regions in the sky where the emission is dominated by resolved sources and by the galactic foreground , and to restrict the analysis only to where the igrb is a significant component .",
    "two definitions for anisotropies were used in  @xcite :    * intensity aps : an intensity map @xmath5 can be decomposed in spherical harmonics , @xmath6 where coefficients @xmath7 determine the aps which is given by @xmath8 .",
    "this definition is particularly useful because it gives us the dimensionful size of intensity fluctuations and can be compared with predictions for source classes whose collective intensity is known or assumed . * fluctuation aps : can be derived from the intensity aps , dividing by the average intensity squared .",
    "the fluctuation aps is energy - independent for a single source class , if all members of the source class share the same observed energy spectrum .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration reported detection of angular power in all 4 energy bins considered , with a signicance larger than @xmath0 in the energy bins from @xmath1 gev to @xmath2 gev .",
    "the data have been compared with the aps of a source model made of i ) the point sources in  @xcite , ii ) a model for the interstellar diffuse emission and iii ) an isotropic component at the level of the igrb in  @xcite .",
    "the model angular power at @xmath9 is consistently below that measured in the data .    despite the mask applied along the galactic plane",
    ", some known galactic emission can extend to high latitudes .",
    "therefore a model of the galactic foregrounds was subtracted from the data , and then the aps of the residual maps was calculated .",
    "this measurement is referred to as the cleaned data in  @xcite .",
    "we use this second measurement in this work .",
    "the aps of gamma rays from dm annihilations or decays has been computed from the all - sky template maps produced in  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite used the millennium - ii n - body simulation to model the abundance and the clustering of extragalactic dm halos and subhalos .",
    "the technique presented in  @xcite , based on the random repetition of copies of the millennium - ii simulation box , is implemented to probe the universe up to @xmath10 .",
    "the emission from dm halos with a mass below the resolution of the simulation was estimated assuming that the halo number density and the mass - luminosity relation obtained from the halos in millennium - ii remains unchanged below the resolution , down to the minimal self - bound halo mass @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , the contribution of low mass subhalos was modeled following the technique described in  @xcite and extended in  @xcite .",
    "the smooth dm halo of the milky way was parametrized in  @xcite as an einasto profile , since this provides the best fit to the milky way - like halo obtained in the aquarius n - body simulation .",
    "galactic subhalos down to @xmath12 @xmath13 were accounted for directly from the aquarius simulation , while we use the same procedure as before to account for the contribution of unresolved subhalos .",
    "it has been shown that such objects do not contribute significantly to the total intensity aps .",
    "in @xcite the effect of the assumptions made in the modeling of the dm distribution also was estimated , looking for their effect both on the intensity of the dm - induced emission and on its aps .",
    "the two most relevant sources of uncertainty are the amount of substructures hosted by dm halos and the value of @xmath11 .",
    "the first gives rise to an uncertainty of a factor 20 - 30 both in the average intensity and in the intensity aps ; when the uncertainty on the value of @xmath11 is taken into account , these factors build up to @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the average intensity and the intensity aps , respectively .",
    "here we present the method used to set conservative limits on the thermally averaged cross section , @xmath16 , for dm annihilation into three different channels , @xmath17 quarks , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 leptons .    * to set constraints we use the foreground - cleaned @xmath20 shown in table ii of  @xcite .",
    "there are four @xmath20 values measured corresponding to four energy bins , @xmath21 gev , @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 gev , and @xmath24 gev .",
    "we use them independently to set limits . * requiring that the dm - induced intensity aps averaged in @xmath25 does not overshoot the measured @xmath20 in the @xmath26 multipole range plus @xmath27 times its error leads to @xmath28 cl limits on @xmath16 is based on the fact that @xmath28 of the area of a gaussian distribution is within @xmath27 standard deviations of the mean . ] . * we know that the igrb anisotropy has multiple contributors , therefore these constraints are conservative . other contributors to igrb anisotropy",
    "are not well known , but we already have constraints on the contribution of blazars  @xcite .",
    "we subtract this contribution from the measured @xmath20 and require that the dm - induced aps does not overshoot this new limit .",
    "figures [ bb ] - [ tau ] show the @xmath28 cl limits on the annihilation cross section for three different channels , @xmath17 quarks , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 leptons , respectively .",
    "the main uncertainty in the predictions obtained in  @xcite lies in the properties of low - mass subhalos , below the mass resolution of the simulations .",
    "different values of the `` subhalo boost '' strongly affect the prediction for the dm - induced gamma - ray intensity and its anisotropies . @xcite",
    "considered two benchmark scenarios for subhalos , assuming that the uncertainties can be modeled by changing the subhalo abundance : i ) the low case , where halos are relatively poor in subhalos , according to the predictions of  @xcite and  @xcite ; the constraints using this scenario are shown in the left - upper panel of figures [ bb ] - [ tau ] , and ii ) the high case , with large subhalo boosts , compatible with what was found by  @xcite ; the right - upper and lower panels in the figures [ bb ] - [ tau ] use this case . in the lower panels the predictions for the dm - induced aps ( with a high subhalo boost ) are compared with the aps measured by fermi - lat once the contribution from blazars is subtracted .",
    "this represents the case where the most stringent constraints on @xmath16 are obtained .",
    "we are currently updating the fermi - lat aps measurement using @xmath29 months of data , we expect to improve the constraints presented in these proceedings after include the new measurement in the method shown in section  [ setting ] .",
