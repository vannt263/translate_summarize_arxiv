    "the present day data from high - energy colliders like lep and tevatron show that almost all measurements are described by the standard model at the loop level",
    ". therefore extensions of the standard model tend to be strongly constrained .",
    "typically such extensions will spoil the agreement with the data through a variety of effects , one of the most important of which is the appearance of flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "even the most popular extension , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , has to finely tune a number of parameters .",
    "this leaves only one type of extensions that are safe , namely , extensions with singlet particles , since singlets do not affect precision variables through loop effects . since the discovery that neutrinos are massive , it is clear that singlet fermions play a role in nature .",
    "moreover arguments from cosmology suggest that singlet scalars could be important @xcite . in a recent analysis of the higgs - search data from lep2",
    "it has been pointed out that such singlet scalars may already have been seen as a smeared - out higgs boson @xcite .",
    "given this situation it is natural to ask whether also singlet vector bosons can be present . + therefore , we decide to study renormalizable extensions of the standard model containing extra gauge bosons , but no extra fermions or scalars . demanding the absence of anomalies in the gauge currents , additional vector bosons can couple to linear combinations of hypercharge ( @xmath1 ) and the difference of baryon and lepton quantum numbers ( bl ) .",
    "however , they can have an arbitrary mixing with the standard model hypercharge field .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the case where the vector bosons couple to the hypercharge only .",
    "such models are , after a redefinition of the gauge fields , equivalent to the standard model with a number of inert gauge bosons , that only couple to the standard model via the mixing with the hypercharge field .",
    "since the extra vector bosons are singlets , their mass does not necessarily have to arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking , but can be put in by hand without violating renormalizability . for phenomenological purposes the differences are minor .",
    "both cases have been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "however if the mass is not generated by the higgs mechanism , an interesting possibility arises when an infinity of fields is present .",
    "it is possible that the extra vector bosons move in more than four dimensions @xcite",
    ". this will not violate the principle of renormalizability , if the number of dimensions is smaller than or equal to six ; also fractional dimensions are possible . as a consequence one finds , after diagonalizing the mass matrix , a physical neutral @xmath0-boson field",
    "coupled to hypercharge . however",
    ", this field does not have a single particle peak but has a well - defined nontrivial continuous klln - lehmann spectral density .",
    "therefore , the search for such a field at hadron colliders becomes more complicated , since the signal is smeared out over a large invariant - mass range and no clear peak is present .",
    "because of their higher - dimensional nature we call this class of models heidi models ( high - d for higher dimension ) .",
    "+ it is the purpose of this paper to determine the range of parameters of the model that can be studied at hadron colliders .",
    "we consider a minimal version of heidi models with a reduced set of free parameters , namely , an extension of the standard model with one single additional inert gauge boson mixing with the standard model hypercharge field , which affects the usual standard model neutral gauge bosons .",
    "while the photon is protected from further mixing by the exact electromagnetic symmetry , no conserved quantum number prevents the @xmath2 boson to mix with the additional @xmath0 boson .",
    "theoretical calculations of various electroweak observables are then modified by the presence of the additional field , which may change the fits of the electroweak precision data and affect the bounds on the higgs mass @xcite . according to this point of view ,",
    "measurements from lep1 and sld at the @xmath2 pole @xcite were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , both for a four - dimensional and for the heidi @xmath0 models .",
    "the analysis on the technical level is not significantly different for the four - dimensional and the higher - dimensional case .",
    "the results of this analysis were recently confirmed in ref .",
    "fitting the data leads to constraints on the allowed parameter range of the heidi models . we will restrict ourselves to the limits given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are on the conservative side .",
    "+ the drell - yan - like production of a lepton pair at hadron colliders plays an important role in the present and future experimental program at the fermilab tevatron and cern lhc colliders thanks to its large cross section and clean signature of the final state .",
    "this is also the primary discovery mode for additional neutral gauge bosons and has already been widely studied in the literature for the tevatron and the lhc @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the forward - backward asymmetry due to the interference between the three different exchange modes ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 ) could be an interesting observable @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work , we investigate for the first time the possible effects of a heidi @xmath0 on the drell - yan dilepton invariant - mass spectrum and the forward - backward asymmetry , both at the tevatron and the lhc .    because of the important theoretical uncertainties coming from qcd effects and missing large higher - order contributions , leading - order results for the drell - yan process , with or without additional @xmath0 , are quite unreliable .",
    "a systematic approach to this problem is based on perturbation theory truncated at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite or next - to - next - to - leading order @xcite in the strong coupling constant @xmath4 . in kinematical regions where higher - order contributions are enhanced due to the soft and collinear parton emission",
    ", soft - gluon resummation to all orders in @xmath4 can be performed and matched with the fixed order predictions in order to improve the description of observables under consideration .",
    "however , a general procedure has not yet been developed and the resummation has to be done explicitly process by process .",
    "an alternative way of treating the soft - gluon emission is the parton shower , which approximates the full resummation calculation .",
    "however , the parton shower is universal for all processes and can be implemented easily in the analysis chains of the tevatron and lhc experiments .",
    "consequently , we implement in this work the heidi @xmath0 bosons in the monte carlo generator mc@nlo @xcite , generalizing the modified mc@nlo program including @xmath0 gauge bosons inspired by grand unified theories of ref.@xcite , which allows us to match nlo perturbative calculation with the parton shower of the monte carlo generator herwig @xcite including color coherence effects and azimutal correlations within and between jets .",
    "we subsequently compare the monte carlo predictions to the experimental results from the tevatron for the invariant - mass spectrum and forward - backward asymmetry of the drell - yan production of lepton - pairs .",
    "in addition we study the sensitivity of the lhc experiments to the heidi models for this channel .",
    "+ the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec:2 ] we first describe the theoretical framework , i.e.  the minimal heidi @xmath0 model , and discuss the implementation of @xmath0-boson production in the mc@nlo generator . section [ sec:3 ] is devoted to the numerical analysis of the experimentally allowed heidi parameter space and the investigation of the sensitivity of the lhc experiments to the model .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "there is a large class of models containing extra neutral vector bosons @xcite .",
    "the simplest extension consists of the standard model plus one additional @xmath5 symmetry , the extended gauge group being @xmath6 .",
    "we associate with the extra symmetry a @xmath7 field that is a singlet under the standard model gauge group .",
    "moreover , we assume that no particle carries a @xmath5 charge . therefore , this @xmath7 field is inert and its presence can only be noticed , because it can mix with the abelian field @xmath8 associated with the @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "because it does not couple to any fermions or higgs fields , the additional @xmath7 field is allowed to move in @xmath10 dimensions . as long as @xmath11",
    "the theory will stay renormalizable .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath8 field must be four - dimensional , because of its couplings to the fermionic fields .",
    "therefore , in this basis , the hypercharge basis , we have two fields , a four - dimensional field coupled to the hypercharge and a higher - dimensional field coupled to nothing . however , the two fields can be mixed by a mass term . in order to describe the physics correctly",
    ", one has to transform to the mass basis . allowing the @xmath12 fields to have masses and mass - mixing terms , one finds for the gauge field part of the lagrangian in the hypercharge basis @xcite :    -_gauge =",

    "the two massive hypercharge fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 are transformed to the mass - eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the latter being massless since the electromagnetic symmetry is exact . as a consequence ,",

    ", we recover models with one massless excitation which becomes the photon after the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "this is guaranteed by the condition of eq.([eq : condphot ] ) . however , while in the four - dimensional case we have a second peak corresponding to a massive resonance located at m_^2 m_d^2 + m_4 ^ 2  ,   [ eq : zpmass ] for five- and six - dimensional singlet fields , we now have a massive continuum .",
    "as stated above , the presence of this new field affects the standard model @xmath2-boson through a mixing which can be described by a quantity @xmath20 defined by @xcite a_y,4 & = & ^2_w  ,   + a_y,5 & = & ^2_w _",

    "one can interpret the propagator of eq.(4 ) in two ways . the simplest way to treat",
    "the theory is to consider the field as a hypercharge gauge field with a nontrivial klln - lehmann spectral density .",

    "the latter interpretation would be natural if we had an integer number of compact higher dimensions .",
    "the drell - yan - like production of a lepton pair plays an important role in the present and future experimental program of hadron colliders thanks to its large cross section and clean signature of the final state .",
    "since any observables related to this process are highly sensitive to the existence of an additional neutral gauge boson , this is their primary discovery mode . following the conventions for the drell - yan process of ref.@xcite , which are the ones used in the monte carlo generator mc@nlo",
    ", the corresponding squared matrix element reads      in order not to double count any contribution , the matching of the nlo matrix element to the parton shower achieved in mc@nlo uses two separate samples of born - like and hard emission events which can have positive or negative weight .",

    "this problem with the data has led a number of authors to consider fitting the data leaving out @xmath36 @xcite . in this case",

    "@xcite , but not for the specific models presented here .",

    "@xcite it would be useful to have lower limits on the mass of the z boson presented in the coupling constant plane .",
