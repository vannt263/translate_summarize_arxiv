    "line emission by molecules and atomic species is the most important cooling process in interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "the temperatures of molecular clouds are determined by the balance between radiative cooling and various heating mechanisms like cosmic ray heating , formation of h@xmath7 molecules , photo - electric heating due to external radiation @xcite and ambipolar drift ( padoan , zweibel & nordlund @xcite ) .    in order to derive the radiative cooling rate for a given species one must first know the excitation conditions in the cloud .",
    "however , the cooling rates also depend on the detailed structure of the cloud and the true net flow of energy can only be obtained by solving the full radiative transfer problem .",
    "so far the calculations have been based on homogeneous models in different geometries or spherically symmetric clouds with smooth density distribution .",
    "because of its large abundance the co molecules is usually the most important coolant of molecular gas .",
    "@xcite studied the co cooling and made comparisons between the co cooling rates and the heating associated with cloud collapse .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations were based on the sobolev , or large velocity gradient ( lvg ) , approximation .",
    "@xcite computed cooling rates due to a number of molecules and atomic species using the lvg method applied to spherical , homogeneous and isothermal model clouds .",
    "they covered a wide density range up to 10@xmath8@xmath2 and a temperatures up to 60k .",
    "although @xmath4co dominates the cooling of low density gas , the rare co isotopes , ci and o@xmath7 were found to contribute a large fraction of the total cooling rates . at even higher densities",
    "the cooling rates are determined by a large number of species including h@xmath7o , various hydrides and molecular ions .",
    "goldsmith & langer considered several heating mechanisms and derived equilibrium temperatures for typical clouds .",
    "@xcite continued this work by studying radiative cooling rates of dense molecular clouds , @xmath9 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11@xmath2 using updated molecular data .",
    "the molecular gas was assumed to be fully shielded from external ionizing radiation .",
    "neufeld et al .",
    "used chemical models to compute the steady state molecular abundances that were used as the basis of the cooling rate calculations .",
    "level populations of the main cooling species were solved using the escape probability formalism @xcite . strictly speaking the calculations assume plane - parallel geometry with strong velocity gradient but the results can be applied also to different geometries . that paper concentrated on the study of isothermal , spherical models .",
    "in the present work we re  examine the cooling efficiency of the main cooling agents in molecular clouds at temperatures t@xmath12100k .",
    "compared with the earlier studies there are two main improvements : i ) the model clouds are no longer assumed to be homogeneous and , more importantly , the density and velocity structures are the result of realistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations ; ii ) the non - lte radiative transfer problem is solved exactly with monte carlo methods .",
    "the solution takes fully into account the inhomogeneous density and velocity fields of the models .",
    "the numerical models used in this work are based on the results of numerical simulations of highly super  sonic magneto  hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , run on a 128@xmath10 computational mesh , with periodic boundary conditions .    as in our previous work ,",
    "the initial density and magnetic fields are uniform .",
    "we apply an external random force , to drive the turbulence at a roughly constant rms mach number of the flow .",
    "the force is generated in fourier space , with power only at small wave numbers ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "a description of the numerical code used to solve the mhd equations may be found in padoan & nordlund ( @xcite and references therein ) .    in order to scale the models to physical units ,",
    "we use the following empirical larson type relations , as in our previous works : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rms sonic mach number of the flow ( the rms flow velocity divided by the sound speed ) , and a temperature @xmath16  k is assumed , and @xmath17 where the gas density @xmath18 is expressed in @xmath2 .",
    "the rms sonic mach number is an input parameter of the numerical simulations , and can be used to scale them to physical units .",
    "the rms alfvnic mach number of the flow @xmath19 is also an input parameter of the numerical simulations .",
    "@xmath20 is defined as the ratio of the rms flow velocity and the alfvn velocity , @xmath21 .",
    "it determines the magnetic field strength , once the sonic rms mach number , @xmath15 , is fixed .",
    "we refer to the turbulent flow as super ",

    "the magnetic field strengths are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : distributions ] , with physical values obtained for the mean density @xmath39  @xmath2 and the kinetic temperature @xmath40  k.",
    "the cooling rates are calculated individually for each cell in the model clouds and for several cooling species .",
    "the original mhd simulations were performed on a 128@xmath10 grid but because of the high computational burden of the radiative transfer calculations most of these calculations were carried out with model clouds re - sampled into a 90@xmath10 cell grid .",
    "the discretization introduces some small smoothing of the high density peaks but is otherwise not expected to affect the derived cooling rates .",
    "the collisional coefficients for co were taken from @xcite , ci - h@xmath7 rates are from @xcite and oi - h@xmath7 rates from @xcite .",
    "the rate coefficients for collisions o@xmath7-h@xmath7 and o@xmath7-he were provided by p. bergman ( @xcite ; private communication ) .",
    "the cooling rates are calculated for the species @xmath4co , @xmath5co , c@xmath6o , o@xmath7 , ci and oi . according to @xcite these are the most important cooling species in the present parameter region , that is at densities below @xmath41@xmath2 and at temperatures @xmath42100k .",
    "cooling rates due to h@xmath7o are calculated only at t@xmath43=60k .    for the co species we assume fractional abundances [ @xmath4co]/[h@xmath7]=@xmath45 , [ @xmath5co]/[h@xmath7]=@xmath46 and [ c@xmath6o]/[h@xmath7]=@xmath47 .",

    "chemical fractionation can lead to abundance variations ( e.g. @xcite ) but we shall assume constant abundances throughout the clouds .",
    "this is probably a good approximation since the inhomogeneous density distribution reduces differences in the radiation field between inner and outer parts of the cloud @xcite and we do consider only isothermal models .",
    "the abundances of o@xmath7 and oi are not well known .",
    "recent results from the iso and swas satellites show that the oxygen abundances in molecular clouds have been previously overestimated and probable values are below [ o@xmath7]/[h@xmath7]@xmath48 @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite found l1689n to be rich in oi indicating that the abundance of oi can be as high as [ oi]/[h@xmath7]@xmath49 .",
    "the predictions of chemical models have usually been closer to 10@xmath50 for both [ oi]/[h@xmath7 ] and [ o@xmath7]/[h@xmath7 ] ( e.g. @xcite ) . above 100k",
    "the abundances are also very sensitive to the assumed temperature but in the temperature range considered in the present work the abundances are essentially independent of temperature @xcite .",
    "we use an abundance of @xmath51 for both oi and o@xmath7 . in view of the recent observational results the oi abundance is adequate but",
    "the o@xmath7 abundance might be too high by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "however , a similar value is used by @xcite and @xcite , which makes comparison with their results easier . for ci",
    "a fractional abundance value of 10@xmath52 will be used .    for water a fractional abundance of 1.0@xmath53",
    "is assumed .",
    "calculations are carried out separately for ortho- and para - water with ortho to para ratio 1:3 .",
    "the total abundance is similar to the values used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , observations of quiescent gas in molecular cloud cores , orion and m17sw @xcite have indicated much lower abundances [ h@xmath7o]/[h@xmath7]@xmath54 .",
    "similar values have been reported by @xcite . the lower values would mean that water is unimportant for the cooling of the clouds considered here . locally h@xmath7o can be very efficient coolant since in outflows and hot cores its abundance can be enhanced up to [ h@xmath7o]/[h@xmath7]@xmath55 @xcite and the importance of h@xmath7o increases with temperature .",
    "our models represent , however , relatively cold and quiescent clouds .",
    "the h@xmath7o cooling rates are therefore computed only for @xmath32=60k and with relative abundance [ h@xmath7o]/[h@xmath7]=1.0@xmath53 the results can be taken as upper limits for the actual h@xmath7o cooling . since we will examine only isothermal models , the possible temperature dependence of the abundances affects only the comparison between models with different @xmath32 . at these low temperatures the temperature dependence is , however ,",
    "weak . according to models ( e.g. @xcite ) there can be a significant dependence on the gas density even when photo - processes due to external radiation field are not considered .",
    "the effect is especially clear for carbon . in the standard model presented by @xcite the carbon abundance increases by a factor @xmath5610 as the gas density decreases from 10@xmath3@xmath2 to 10@xmath10@xmath2",
    "this would reduce the spatial variation in the carbon emission .",
    "we have not included these abundance variations in our models .",
    "the steady state abundances are not necessarily valid for the turbulent medium of the mhd models where density variations are caused by moving shock fronts and the predicted abundances must be treated with some caution .      for practical reasons",
    "the number of energy levels that can be included in the calculations is limited .",
    "the number of levels needed for an accurate estimate of the cooling rate depends mainly on the excitation as all significantly populated levels must be considered .",
    "the relative importance of the transitions is affected also by optical depth , as optically thick transitions contribute less to the total cooling rate .",
    "in the case of @xmath4co we find that at low temperatures , @xmath57k , it is sufficient to include levels up to @xmath58 .",
    "higher transitions are more important at higher densities",
    ". however , at 20k , the cooling rate of the @xmath59 transition is approximately two orders of magnitude below that of the @xmath60 transition , even for densities @xmath6110@xmath10@xmath2 .",
    "the total contribution from higher transitions is insignificant .    at higher temperatures , @xmath62k",
    ", we include the 15 lowest energy levels of @xmath4co . in figure",
    "[ fig : cbt_n_t ] the cooling rate in model @xmath25 is plotted as a function of the kinetic temperature . at @xmath63k and",
    "at densities @xmath3810@xmath3@xmath2 the cooling rate from the @xmath59 transition is roughly equal to the rate from the @xmath60 transition .",
    "however , the population as a function of @xmath64 decreases rapidly and the contribution of levels close to @xmath65 is insignificant .",
    "all models have similar ranges of density and the same number of levels is used also for the other two model clouds ( @xmath28 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "due to small optical depths the number of populated @xmath5co and c@xmath6o levels is lower than in @xmath4co . for these species",
    "we include 10 levels at @xmath6620k and 12 at higher temperatures .",
    "the number of o@xmath7 levels used in the calculations was the same as for co but because of the fine structure there are now 22 transitions between the first 15 energy levels . for both ci and oi ,",
    "3 energy levels were used , with only 2 transitions between them .",
    "the ci lines are @xmath10p@xmath67-@xmath10p@xmath68 at 610@xmath34 m and @xmath10p@xmath7-@xmath10p@xmath68 at 230@xmath34 m and the corresponding oi lines are at 145@xmath34 m and 63@xmath34 m . cooling rates due to h@xmath7o were calculated only at 60k and only 11 energy levels ( 20 transitions ) were included .",
    "this is adequate due to the relatively low densities and temperatures .",
    "the highest included levels are more than @xmath69k above the ground state and are not significantly populated .",
    "the inhomogeneous cloud structure of the mhd models increases the photon escape probability in otherwise optically thick transitions . the cooling rate from lower transitions",
    "is increased while the population of the higher levels is decreased .",
    "the model cloud is divided into 90@xmath10 cells .",
    "each cell is assumed to be homogeneous and is characterized by one value of density , intrinsic linewidth and macroscopic velocity . density and velocity are obtained directly from mhd simulations once the results are scaled to physical units . the intrinsic linewidth is the sum of thermal line broadening and the doppler broadening caused by turbulent motions inside the cell .",
    "the latter is estimated as the rms velocity difference between neighboring cells .",
    "the components are of the same order but usually the turbulent line broadening is the larger of the two . the radiative transfer problem is solved with a monte carlo method ( method b in @xcite )",
    ". the radiation field is simulated by a large number of photon packages going through the cloud .",
    "these represent both photons entering the cloud from the background and photons emitted within the cloud . as a photon package goes through a cell the number of photons absorbed within that cell",
    "is removed from the package . at the same time",
    "the number of upward transitions induced by these photons is stored in counters .",
    "there is a separate counter for each cell and each simulated transition .",
    "after the simulation of the radiation field the counters are used to obtain new estimates of the level populations .",
    "the whole process is repeated until the level populations converge ( the relative change from an iteration to the next is less than 10@xmath50 ) .",
    "the core saturation method was used to speed the calculations of optically thick species @xcite .",
    "the cooling rates of the cells are also calculated with a monte carlo method , using the previously obtained level populations . during the computation the net flux of photons",
    "is counted for each cell and this is transformed into cooling rates in units of ergs@xmath70@xmath2 . in order to study the relative importance of the transitions the net flux is counted for each transition separately .",
    "the local cooling rate depends mainly on three parameters : the local density , kinetic temperature and effective column density , or effective optical depth .",
    "the optical depth determines the photon escape probability that in our case is strongly affected by the inhomogeneity of the clouds .",
    "the optical depth seen by a cell varies strongly depending on the line of sight .",
    "this is true throughout the cloud , not only close to the cloud surface .",
    "the effective optical depth depends on both the density and the velocity distributions since the velocity dispersion is always large compared with the thermal linewidth .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the models is approximately 3.0  km / s , assuming a sound speed 0.3  km / s .    in order to quantify these effects ,",
    "we have calculated the effective column density , @xmath71 , seen by each cell in the three models .",
    "we define this as @xmath72 @xmath73 is the column density along one line of sight from the edge of the cloud to the cell and @xmath74 is the local absorption profile , both given in units of velocity .",
    "the integral is proportional to the column density seen by the cell towards one direction and the averaging is done over all directions .",
    "@xmath71 is calculated as a by - product of the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the cooling rate depends on @xmath71 through its effect on the effective optical depth seen by the cells i.e. the escape probability .",
    "the optical depth depends in a complicated way on the excitation in other parts of the cloud .",
    "the effective column density is , on the other hand , a parameter of the cloud itself and describes the effects of the density and velocity fields independently of the studied molecule .",
    "for these reason the effective column density will be used as a substitute for the effective optical depth .",
    "the distributions of @xmath71 seen by individual cells are shown in figure  [ fig : nn_distribution ] for the three models .",
    "@xmath71 is smallest on the surface of the cloud and increases towards the centre depending , however , on the actual density and velocity fields . in microturbulent case with gaussian line profiles",
    "we would get @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 is approximately equal to the average column density between the cell and the cloud boundary . in our case",
    "we have @xmath77@xmath2 and @xmath78=3.1pc .",
    "when total velocity dispersion , some 3kms@xmath70 at 20k , is used for @xmath79 we obtain an effective column density of @xmath563@xmath8010@xmath81@xmath82km@xmath70s in the cloud centre . in mhd simulations",
    "the turbulence is , however , not random and more importantly the density distribution is not constant .",
    "higher values , up to @xmath83@xmath82km@xmath70s , are therefore reached in dense and velocity coherent regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : nnplane ] summarizes the co cooling rate for model @xmath25 as a function of density , @xmath18 , effective column density , @xmath71 , and temperature . in figure",
    "[ fig : coolcolden ] the cooling rate @xmath84 in model @xmath25 is plotted as a function of the effective column density @xmath71 , for different density intervals and kinetic temperatures @xmath32 .",
    "this illustrates some basic features seen in the case of all three model clouds .",
    "@xmath85 decreases with @xmath71 , particularly in the case of low temperatures and high volume densities .",
    "the behavior is the result of the dense cores becoming opaque . in low density regions ,",
    "the net cooling is reduced also by the incoming flux from surrounding regions that , due to the higher density , have higher excitation temperature . at higher kinetic temperatures more transitions are contributing to the cooling rates and photon trapping can not reduce the cooling rates to the same extent .",
    "similar effects can be seen by studying the cooling rates @xmath85 computed separately for different co transitions .",
    "figure  [ fig : coolcbt ] illustrates the situation for model @xmath25 .",
    "the increasing importance of higher co transitions with increasing column density is evident . in the higher",
    "density ranges the importance of higher transitions is larger ( see figure  [ fig : coolcbt ] ) .",
    "the increase in the cooling rate of the @xmath86 transition , for example , tends to be more rapid than the decrease in lower transitions . as a result ,",
    "the total cooling rate does not drop significantly with @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ fig : coolcbt_t ] shows similar @xmath85 dependencies at three temperatures . at @xmath87k",
    "the cooling rate of the transition @xmath60 ( and @xmath88 ) decreases strongly as column density exceeds @xmath89@xmath82 .",
    "the increase in the cooling rate from the higher transitions is unable to compensate for the loss and the total cooling rate decreases as seen in fig  [ fig : coolcolden ] . on the other hand , already at @xmath32=20k the cooling rate by the transition @xmath90 exceeds at high column densities that of the transition @xmath60 and @xmath85 levels off .",
    "however , the rates do not decrease significantly even at @xmath91@xmath82 . at @xmath32=20k",

    "the corresponding values are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . at higher temperatures optical depths of individual transitions are lower and",
    "this reduces the effect that column density has on local cooling rates .",
    "we have computed an analytic approximation of the cooling rates @xmath99 ) .",
    "the rates @xmath85 are fitted at each temperature with a function @xmath100 \\label{eq : formula }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is not the most optimal functional form for fitting the cooling rates but is conceptually simple .",
    "parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 are , respectively , the slopes of the density and the column density dependence and the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 represent the non - linearity of these relationships . as a first approximation",
    "the dependence of the @xmath85 on the density and column density is linear on the log - log scale .",
    "deviations from this behavior are visible at low kinetic temperatures as a flattening or even a turnover in the density dependence .",
    "although similar turnover is seen in the cooling rates of individual co transitions also at higher temperatures ( see figure  [ fig : all_n_cool ] ) the _ total _ cooling rates are monotonic in the present density and column density ranges .",
    "the turnover is simply transferred to higher densities and/or column densities . in the case of ci , flattening is even more pronounced and persists to higher temperatures .",
    "for the fitting of eq .",
    "[ eq : formula ] the cells of the clouds were divided into small density and column density bins and the parameters of eq .",
    "[ eq : formula ] were fitted using the average values @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 in each bin .",
    "the fitting was weighted with the number of the cells in each bin and the fit is therefore least reliable in the tails of the density and column density distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : coeffs ] shows the fitted parameters as a function of the kinetic temperature in the case of @xmath4co .",
    "note the decreasing dependence of cooling rate on column density when kinetic temperature is increased ( coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath104 ) . as already stated , this is a natural consequence of the reduced optical depth per transition .",
    "a related effect is the increased importance of density at higher temperatures ( coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath103 ) .",
    "the first excitation level of co is at @xmath565k and e.g. @xmath108 is @xmath109k above the ground state .",
    "therefore , at @xmath11010k only a couple of levels can be populated whereas at @xmath11080k a density increase can easily double the number of populated levels and markedly increase the escape probability of the emitted photons .    the dependence on the effective column density , @xmath71 , is not very strong for the cooling rate @xmath85 .",
    "this is true for optically thin species and even for @xmath4co , at least for temperatures above 10k ( see figure  [ fig : coolcolden ] ) .",

    "the average dipole moment of diatomic non - hydrides ( cs , no , cn etc . ) is approximately 10 times the dipole moment of the co molecule .",
    "the radiative rates are therefore two orders of magnitude higher and this results in the first term of the equation .",

    "the cooling rates ( @xmath122 ) in model @xmath28 are a few of percent larger than in model @xmath25 . at somewhat higher densities , @xmath12510@xmath10@xmath2",
    ", the rates are below those of the model @xmath25 ( at 10k by some 10% but at 60k by only @xmath561% ) .",
    "the net cooling rate ( @xmath85 ) in model @xmath26 is 4% smaller than in model @xmath25 . as a function of density and column density",
    "the rates are between those of the models @xmath28 and @xmath25 and usually closer to the rates in model @xmath28 .",
    "the model @xmath26 included self - gravity which should affect the structure of the high density concentrations .",
    "this does not , however , show clearly in the overall density distribution ( see figure  [ fig : distributions ] ) and even at @xmath3810@xmath10@xmath2 the cooling rates are quite similar to those found in the other models .",
    "same trend continues up to highest densities , @xmath3810@xmath3@xmath2 , with model @xmath25 having cooling rates 5 - 10% in excess of the other two models .",
    "the cooling function should be sensitive to the cloud structure . in the range @xmath910@xmath12610@xmath10@xmath2 and @xmath12710@xmath12810@xmath129@xmath82 the differences in the @xmath4co cooling efficiency in the three mhd models are , however , below 20% and from this point of view the models do not differ radically from each other .",
    "all have similar types of inhomogeneous density structures and the overall velocity dispersions are also similar .",
    "furthermore , the clumpiness increases the photon escape probability and reduces any effects caused by large optical depths .",
    "the differences between mhd models would be enhanced e.g. in clouds with larger size , higher density or lower turbulence .      in the previous chapters",
    "we have studied the local cooling rate as a function of the _ local gas properties _ , density @xmath18 and kinetic temperature @xmath32 , and the general environment described by the effective column density @xmath71 . since earlier theoretical studies and observers tend to concentrate on the _ average properties _ of the clouds we will now discuss the _ average _ cooling rate which is also proportional to the net cooling of the cloud as a whole .",
    "figure  [ fig : average_cooling ] shows the cooling rates in model @xmath25 averaged over the model volume .",
    "note the steep temperature dependence of the oi emission .",
    "the actual ratios between different species depend on the assumed abundances and , as already mentioned , for species other than @xmath4co the cooling efficiency scales almost linearly with the abundance .",
    "we now study more closely the @xmath4co cooling .",
    "the cooling rate depends strongly on the density ( figure [ fig : all_n_cool ] ) . in an inhomogeneous cloud",
    "this means that most of the cooling power comes from regions denser than the average .",
    "the average cooling rate is also higher than the local rate at the density equal to the mean density of the cloud .",
    "this is true as long as the dense cores are not optically very thick .",
    "when the cores become opaque to most of the cooling lines the cooling efficiency will not increase any more with increasing density and the total cooling efficiency will be reduced .",
    "figure  [ fig : ntnt ] shows both the _ local cooling rate _ and the _ average cooling rate _ of @xmath4co , as a function of density for three different kinetic temperatures .",
    "the local rates are obtained from the individual cells of the model @xmath25 as the cooling rate of a cell divided by the gas density in the cell .",
    "the entire model cloud provides the point at 320@xmath2 for the curve showing the average cooling rate @xmath130 . here the cooling rate and the density are averaged separately over the volume of the model .",
    "the average cooling rate is proportional to the net cooling rate of the entire model ( ergs@xmath70 ) .",
    "other points for the average cooling rate are from models which were obtained by scaling the mean density of model @xmath25 to 160 , 640 , 1280 and 2560@xmath2 .",
    "the rates follow the expected behavior outlined above . at lower densities",
    "the average rates exceed the local rates , with a ratio approaching a factor of ten . even in the @xmath131=320@xmath2 model",
    "the co rate @xmath85 levels off at the highest densities . in models with high mean density",
    "this leads to a turnover and eventually the average rate drops below the curve for the local cooling rate .",
    "this means that gas below the mean density is getting more and more important for the net cooling of the cloud . for 10k models the curves meet below 10@xmath10@xmath2 . at higher temperatures",
    "the optical depth effects are again reduced and at 60k the average rate remains above the local rate until close to 10@xmath3@xmath2 .",
    "this is perhaps the most striking result of the present work .",
    "molecular clouds described by turbulent density and velocity field as modeled here , can radiate 10 times more efficiently than a uniform cloud with density equal to the mean density of our model . as a consequence",
    ", their thermal balance requires a ten times larger heating source . in order to study separately the effects of the density and the velocity inhomogeneities we have considered two further models that are based on model @xmath25 .",
    "the constant density model , @xmath132 , has constant density 320@xmath2 ( equal to the mean density in the model @xmath25 ) but the velocity structure of the model @xmath25 .",
    "the constant velocity model , @xmath133 , has the same density structure as the model @xmath25 but no macroscopic velocity field .",
    "only @xmath4co cooling rates were calculated since , due to high optical depth , these are most likely to show differences between the models .    compared with model @xmath25 the effective column densities are higher in @xmath133 and @xmath132 , since the inhomogeneity of either densities or velocities is removed .",
    "this gives the appearance of increased @xmath85 when plotted against @xmath71 .",
    "this is , however , only due to the shift of the @xmath71 axis and the total cooling rate of the clouds is reduced .",
    "this is natural since the escape probability of emitted photons is smaller . for model @xmath133 the total @xmath4co cooling rate",
    "is reduced by @xmath5610% at @xmath32=10k .",
    "the effect reduces at higher temperatures as the optical depths of individual transitions are reduced . for model",
    "@xmath132 the drop is @xmath5650% at 10k and increases with temperature .",
    "the difference between the original model and @xmath132 is not due to radiative transfer effects but is rather a direct consequence of the steep density dependence of the cooling function . in an inhomogeneous cloud",
    "most of the cooling is provided by regions with density well above the average value . for optically thin emission",
    "the ratio of average cooling rate and cooling rate at the mean density can be derived directly based on the cell density distribution ( figure  [ fig : distributions ] ) and the density dependence @xmath134 .",
    "the ratios are 3.9 , 8.0 and 8.9 for the models @xmath28 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .    since density peaks are very important for the cooling we must make sure that the results are not affected by the limited spatial resolution .",
    "the co cooling rates were compared in three variants of the model @xmath25 where the cloud was divided into either 128@xmath10 , 90@xmath10 or 48@xmath10 cells .",
    "the plots of local cooling rates against local density were almost indistinguishable although at lower resolutions the total range of densities was reduced .",
    "a change in the discretization causes changes in the cell densities . in the plot",
    "this means only a small displacement along the @xmath135 curve which itself remains unchanged . as the cell size",
    "is increased some of the velocity dispersion between cells ( ` macroturbulence ' ) is transformed into turbulent velocity inside the cells ( ` microturbulence ' ) but this did not produce any noticeable effects on the cooling rates . at @xmath32=20k",
    "the total cooling rates of the models were within @xmath563% of each other .",
    "this shows that the selected resolution was sufficient to capture the effects of density and velocity inhomogeneities .",
    "our models represent quiescent diffuse clouds . in models with",
    "more developed cloud cores and steeper density gradients the spatial resolution should be correspondingly higher .",
    "most previous calculations of molecular line cooling rates have focused on specific objects ( for example dense cores ) and are therefore not useful for comparison with the present work . in particular , little has so far been published on the subject in connection with inhomogeneous clouds . in the following we look at some of the differences between our work and the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their results apply to clouds with continuous and smooth density distributions .",
    "differences will be caused by two factors .",
    "firstly , our mhd models contain a range of densities and due to steep density dependence ( e.g. figure  [ fig : all_n_cool ] ) total radiated energy will be larger than in a homogeneous cloud with equal mean density ( see previous chapter ) . secondly , excitation and escape probability of emitted photons will be affected by the density and velocity inhomogeneities .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ntfit ] we plot the @xcite cooling rates for @xmath4co and ci together with our average rates at a few densities ( solid squares ) . in the same figure the local cooling rates for the @xmath39@xmath2 model",
    "are also shown ( solid curve ) .",
    "this should be compared only with those points on the other curves that correspond to the same density .",
    "we will first compare the co rates .",
    "for the lvg model used by goldsmith & langer the relevant parameter is the co abundance divided by the velocity gradient , @xmath136 . in our models",
    "a corresponding parameter can be calculated using the average velocity dispersion of the cloud and the linear size of the model , @xmath137 .",
    "choosing models where these parameters agree ensures that the average properties of the lvg and the mhd models will be similar .",
    "differences will be caused by differences at smaller scales i.e. mostly by the density and velocity inhomogeneity of our models . in the mhd simulations the velocity and density fields",
    "are not completely random and depending on the line of sight the average density and column density can differ significantly from the values averaged over the entire volume of the cloud .    in the following we will use the fwhm of the one - dimensional velocity distribution as the measure of the velocity dispersion in our models .",
    "the value is calculated as the average over the whole cloud . in model",
    "@xmath25 the fwhm of the velocity dispersion is 2.90kms@xmath70 at @xmath32=10k . with abundance 5@xmath8010@xmath138 and cloud size 6.25pc we get a column density per velocity unit of 1.08@xmath8010@xmath50pckm@xmath70s . in figure",
    "[ fig : ntfit ] the model is compared with goldsmith & langer calculations for @xmath139=10@xmath50pckm@xmath70s . at 40k",
    "the velocity dispersion in the mhd model was higher , fwhm=5.77kms@xmath70 , corresponding to the higher speed of sound .",
    "the column density is 5.4@xmath8010@xmath138pckm@xmath70s and the corresponding value of the goldsmith & langer model shown in figure  [ fig : ntfit ] is 4@xmath8010@xmath138pckm@xmath70s .",
    "goldsmith & langer note that their results are not sensitive to the assumed velocity gradient and in our case similar conclusion can be drawn from the weak column density dependence in figure  [ fig : coolcolden ] .",
    "therefore , an absolute equality of the column density parameters is not crucial and the qualitative result of the comparison would remain the same even if our column density values were scaled by a factor of two .    at 10k our _ local _",
    "@xmath4co cooling rate at @xmath9320@xmath2 agrees with the predictions of goldsmith & langer ( see figure  [ fig : ntfit ] ) .",
    "the point is still on the linear portion of the curve i.e. radiative trapping is not yet significant .",
    "the _ average _ cooling rate is , however , two times higher than either the goldsmith & langer value or our local cooling rate at that density .",
    "this is due to the fact that the density dependence of the cooling rate @xmath140 is steeper than @xmath141 . in the case of a wider distribution of density values the average cooling rate increases even when the mean density remains unaltered .    at 40k",
    "the effects of optical depth are greatly reduced and in the model with mean density 320@xmath2 the local cooling rate is almost a linear function of local density .",
    "this increases the difference to goldsmith & langer results which are at @xmath142@xmath2 a factor of six below our rate . at 10k",
    "the average cooling rate @xmath85 was a decreasing function of density but at 40k it increases up to @xmath143@xmath2 . in the model with mean density @xmath131=320@xmath2 the local cooling rate exceeds the volume averaged rate by a factor of four .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ntfit ] the errorbars indicate the variation in local cooling rate , @xmath85 , within each density bin ( see also figure  [ fig : all_n_cool ] ) . although this does include some noise from the monte carlo calculations most of the variation is due to radiative transfer effects .",
    "the cells are in different environments ( e.g. cloud centre vs. cloud surface ) and this affects the cooling . at 40k",
    "the local cooling rate is rather uniform while at 10k there is wider scatter , especially at high densities .",
    "this shows again how an increasing kinetic temperature reduces the effects of optical depth .    for ci",
    "the abundance used in this paper was 10@xmath52 i.e. a factor of ten lower than the value used by goldsmith & langer .",
    "the relevant parameter is , however , again @xmath144 .",
    "none of the results published by goldsmith & langer correspond exactly to the parameters of our models and therefore we have rescaled our abundance value so that our model can be compared directly with their figure7 .",
    "another difference is caused by the collisional coefficients .",
    "goldsmith & langer used for ci - h@xmath7 collisions the @xcite ci ",
    "h rates divided by ten . in this paper we have used rates given by @xcite and these result in a significantly higher ci cooling . however , in figure  [ fig : ntfit ] we have derived the ci cooling using the scaled @xcite coefficients . after these modifications the predicted cooling rates agree at low column densities and the mean density and the average column density per velocity interval are identical to the values in the goldsmith & langer model .",
    "the main features are similar as in the case of co. our local ci rate @xmath85 increases up to density @xmath145@xmath2 where the goldsmith & langer curves are already clearly decreasing . at 40k the turnover",
    "is shifted further to a higher density .",
    "the average ci rates at five mean densities between 160@xmath2 and 2560@xmath2 are shown in the same figure . in the model",
    "@xmath131=320@xmath2 the average rate exceeds the local cooling rate at this density by a factor of @xmath563 .",
    "the ratio is the same at both 10k and 40k .",
    "when the mean density exceeds 1000@xmath2 the average rates drop close to goldsmith & langer predictions .    compared with co",
    "the main difference is that the kinetic temperature has very little effect on the shape of the ci curves . at 40k",
    "the co curve has become almost linear while the ci has similar flattening as at 10k .",
    "the effect is visible also in the average rates . while for co @xmath85 changes from a decreasing function to an increasing one , little change is seen in the ci curves .",
    "there are only three populated ci levels and the effect kinetic temperature can have on the optical depth of the transitions is correspondingly smaller .",
    "the second excitation level of ci is more than 60k above the ground state while co has already five energy levels below this .    in comparison with @xcite",
    "some of the differences are due to the abundances .",
    "for example , the chemical models of @xcite predict oi and o@xmath7 fractional abundances slightly below 10@xmath3 .",
    "the values adopted in this paper are lower by almost a factor of ten , but oi still provides a few per cent of the total cooling rate at the highest density and temperature in our models .",
    "the optical depth of most species is sufficiently low , so that the cooling rate depends linearly on the abundance . for example , reducing the abundance of o@xmath7 by a factor of ten decreases the cooling rate by the same factor , the accuracy of the linear relation being @xmath1463% at 10k and better than 0.5% at 60k . on the other hand , the @xmath4co cooling rate decreases with @xmath71 , especially at high column densities .",
    "therefore , a change in the @xmath4co abundance has a relatively small effect on the cooling efficiency .",
    "we checked this by reducing the @xmath4co abundance by 50% in the model @xmath28 . assuming @xmath32=10k the value of @xmath85",
    "is reduced by 47% for column densities @xmath147@xmath82 roughly independent of volume density . however , when the column density reaches @xmath148@xmath82 the reduction in @xmath85 is no more than 20% .    @xcite give cooling rate as a function of column density measure , @xmath149 , i.e. number density divided by the velocity gradient or , in the absence of a gradient , by the velocity dispersion divided by distance .",
    "this is essentially the number of hydrogen atoms per velocity unit , in units of @xmath82km@xmath70s .",
    "there is , however , an additional factor , @xmath150 , which depends on the geometry . for plane parallel medium with large velocity gradient",
    "the value is @xmath151 and in the centre of a static sphere @xmath152 .",
    "the effect of the abundance is included in the parameter @xmath118 and its value need not be known separately .",
    "in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : average_cooling_co ] we plot the _ average _ @xmath4co rate for model @xmath25 , with the mean density scaled to 160 , 640 , and 2560@xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath118 was estimated as @xmath153 with @xmath151 and @xmath79 equal to the rms velocity dispersion in the mhd model at given temperature .",
    "the lower three lines show predictions by @xcite and the dotted lines show the rates with @xmath118 multiplied by two or by one half .",
    "the lower panel shows the corresponding rates as function of the mean cloud density .",
    "the main difference is again due to the density inhomogeneity of mhd models .",
    "gas with density above the average value provides most of the cooling power and the cooling rate is comparable to that of a much denser homogeneous cloud . in the low density models the neufeld et al .",
    "formula would give a fairly good prediction of the cooling rate if density value @xmath154 were used .",
    "on the other hand , rate could be raised only slightly by lowering @xmath118 .",
    "next we will discuss again the _ local _ cooling rates . in figure",
    "[ fig : comparison ] our @xmath4co cooling efficiencies , @xmath140 , are shown together with the results of neufeld et al .",
    "( @xcite , table 3 ) as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "our curves correspond to the analytic approximation of the local cooling rate in model @xmath25 ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : analytical ] ) . for the plot",
    "we must determine a relation between our parameter @xmath71 , which is a quantity integrated over the local absorption profile , and @xmath118 used by neufeld et al .",
    "for gaussian lines we have relation @xmath1230.3@xmath155 ( see section  [ sect : rates ] ) while for plane - parallel flow ( geometrical factor @xmath151 ) @xmath156 .",
    "this gives a conversion @xmath157 and this relation is used to plot our results on the @xmath118 scale in figure  [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "the scaling between @xmath118 and @xmath117 is only approximate and depends on the lvg model assumed .",
    "the curves may therefore be shifted in the horizontal direction . however",
    ", the shift should correspond to no more than a factor of two change in @xmath118 .",
    "the most important difference is the marked flattening of the column density dependence that is seen in our models at higher kinetic temperatures .",
    "this is the same effect as seen e.g. in figures  [ fig : ntnt ] and [ fig : ntfit ] and we interpret this as the consequence of varying excitation conditions that allow efficient cooling even in the dense gas .",
    "low density gas radiates in low transitions while cooling in dense cores takes place mainly through higher transitions . at higher kinetic temperatures more transitions",
    "can contribute to the cooling and there is a clear difference between subthermally excited low density gas and cores that are close to thermalization .",
    "different parts of the cloud are therefore decoupled not only due to velocity differences but also because they radiate mostly in different transitions .",
    "the difference between our results and those in @xcite decreases with decreasing temperature , i.e. , at low kinetic temperatures our models behave more like homogeneous clouds . at low temperatures",
    "the number of excited levels is small and the remaining transitions have higher optical depth . in figure",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we show curves only for density @xmath3810@xmath10@xmath2 but the results are qualitatively similar even at other densities .    the detected differences between inhomogeneous and homogeneous cloud models can be attributed to two effects .",
    "firstly , density and velocity inhomogeneities increase the photon escape probability .",
    "both the excitation and the escape probability of photons are determined by the optical depths towards different lines of sight . in the center of a homogeneous cloud",
    "the optical depth is the same towards all directions .",
    "an inhomogeneous cloud with the same average optical depth has always a higher escape probability , since the escape probability is proportional to the average of exp(-@xmath158 ) and not to the average of @xmath158 .",
    "this leads to higher escape probability but generally also to lower excitation .",
    "secondly , in the considered models @xmath85 is still an increasing function of density and therefore density variations tend to increase the total cooling power .",
    "the slope of @xmath85 is , of course , determined by the radiative transfer and the two effects are closely interrelated .",
    "the density distribution was seen to affect the photon escape probability also indirectly through excitation .",
    "some excitation levels are populated only in the densest regions and this leads to a partial decoupling between the dense cores and the surrounding low density gas .",
    "we have studied the radiative cooling of molecular gas at temperatures @xmath159=10 - 80k and densities @xmath160@xmath2 , based on three - dimensional mhd calculations of the density and velocity structure of interstellar clouds .",
    "the models have been scaled to linear sizes @xmath566pc and mean densities in the range 1602560@xmath2 .",
    "the cooling rates for isothermal clouds were computed by solving the radiative transfer problem with monte carlo methods .      * inhomogeneous density and velocity fields reduce photon trapping and thus increase the cooling rates . in comparison with homogeneous cloud models the mhd models are much less affected by optical depths effects .",
    "this is especially true at kinetic temperatures @xmath16160k .",
    "* there is a clear difference between the density dependence of local cooling rates and the density dependence of cooling rates averaged over entire clouds .",
    "* at low to intermediate densities most of the cooling power is provided by clumps with densities above the average gas density .",
    "the average cooling rate for a model with given mean density can be as much as an order of magnitude larger than the local cooling rate at the same density . in models with higher average density and lower temperature",
    "the differences are smaller since the densest parts of clouds become optically thick . * compared with earlier models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) our local cooling rates differ mainly at large densities where our rates are higher due to reduced photon trapping .",
    "the volume averaged cooling rates are higher than in the earlier models typically by a factor of few . at higher temperatures ( @xmath162k )",
    "the difference can be almost one order of magnitude .",
    "* for the mhd models , the absence of the macroscopic velocity field would reduce the cooling by up to 10% . * the absence of density fluctuations would reduce cooling by @xmath5650% at 10k .",
    "this is caused mainly by the density dependence of the cooling rates and the radiative transfer effects are less important . at high temperatures ( @xmath16380k ) the difference to homogeneous models approaches a factor of ten .",
    "* @xmath4co is clearly the most important coolant over the whole parameter range studied .",
    "* at low temperatures @xmath5co is the the second most important coolant , after @xmath4co . at temperatures @xmath16460k it",
    "is exceeded by oi , which can provide more than 10% of the total cooling ( assuming a relative abundance @xmath5610@xmath138 ) .",
