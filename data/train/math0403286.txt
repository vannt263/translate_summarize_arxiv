    "but in general this is only true for the directions tangent to @xmath197 , a detailed study of the behavior of these two metrics will appear in a separate forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the same error is also in @xcite . a short proof of this fact is as follows :    with respect to the metric @xmath184 , the sphere @xmath198 is totally geodesic ( since for a riemannian submersion the horizontal lift of a geodesic is a geodesic ) .",

    "thus the induced metric on @xmath13 extends the metric @xmath205 on @xmath183 near its boundary and finishes with the product metric @xmath216 .      for each @xmath217 , we have the following @xmath205-orthogonal decomposition of @xmath218 @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the unit tangent vector to the curve @xmath221 in the @xmath213-plane and @xmath222 are as in [ riem : submbis ] .",

    "<S> the second h. weyl curvature invariant of a riemannian manifold , denoted @xmath0 , is the second curvature invariant which appears in the well known tube formula of h. weyl . </S>",
    "<S> it coincides with the gauss - bonnet integrand in dimension 4 . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial property of @xmath0 is that it is nonnegative for einstein manifolds , hence it provides a geometric obstruction to the existence of einstein metrics in dimensions @xmath1 , independently from the sign of the einstein constant . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates our study of the positivity of this invariant . here in this paper </S>",
