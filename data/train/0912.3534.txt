    "with the recent first collisions at the lhc we are entering a new era of discovery in particle physics . colliding protons at very high energies makes the lhc a fertile environment for the production of high - multiplicity events .",
    "if we are to take full advantage of the discovery potential at high energy hadron colliders such as the tevatron and the lhc , we need to have a precise understanding of the physics that will occur there .",
    "this necessitates computations of the standard model background , especially of qcd processes , to at least next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the perturbative series .",
    "historically , the bottleneck in nlo computations has been the one - loop virtual contributions . over the last few years",
    "rapid progress has been made in the development of new techniques for these one - loop computations .",
    "these advancements have been motivated both by a greater desire to understand the structure of scattering amplitudes as well as the need for improved efficiency and automation in the computation of one - loop matrix elements .",
    "these matrix elements are needed , for example , for the precise computation of many background processes at the lhc ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . the ability to automate and `` mass - produce '' amplitudes requires approaches that are both numerically stable and straightforward to implement as an algorithm .",
    "the standard approach to performing this class of computations has heavily relied upon feynman diagram techniques .",
    "there have been many impressive results with this approach ( see @xcite and references therein ; for example , cross sections for 6-point processes that have been computed via feynman diagrammatic methods include  @xcite ) .",
    "however , feynman diagrams suffer from two problems .",
    "for one , there is a factorial growth in the number of terms as the multiplicity of partons in the process increases .",
    "furthermore , each feynman diagram is gauge dependent .",
    "this means that there will be large cancellations between terms that combine to give the gauge - independent amplitudes .",
    "it is these two problems that make automated approaches using feynman diagrams difficult as the number of partons increases .",
    "consequentially , the focus of much recent progress has been to side - step these issues . on - shell",
    "recursion and unitarity methods work with gauge - independent amplitudes as building blocks instead of feynman diagrams .",
    "it is these new techniques that we focus on in this review .",
    "an earlier review of these techniques was presented in  @xcite . however , many of the details presented there have been superseded by even more efficient techniques which we present in the following .    in general ,",
    "as we will explain in more detail below , a one - loop amplitude can be decomposed into a set of scalar box , triangle , bubble , and tadpole integrals , that is , integrals with four , three , two , or one loop propagators , respectively .",
    "these scalar integrals contain all the logarithmic and polylogarithmic dependence of the amplitude and are multiplied by rational coefficients .",
    "in addition , there are also purely rational terms in the amplitude .",
    "the original unitarity approach of @xcite applied two - particle cuts in four dimensions and was used to produce many results  @xcite .",
    "the terms containing ( poly)logarithms and associated constants could all be computed via two - particle cuts .",
    "terms with only a rational dependence on momentum invariants however could not be computed in this way and separate techniques were required  @xcite . a systematic approach for the computation of these rational terms without the use of feynman diagrams did not appear until a few years ago .",
    "the starting point for these developments were the recursion relations , developed at tree level by britto et al .",
    "( bcfw )  @xcite . an earlier version of a tree - level recursion relation was the off - shell berends - giele recursion  @xcite .",
    "the proof of the bcfw on - shell recursion relations only relies upon the factorization properties of the amplitudes and on cauchy s theorem .",
    "they could therefore be adapted to the more complicated problem of computing the rational parts of loop amplitudes  @xcite . on - shell recursion for the rational parts of loop amplitudes was first used in an analytic context  @xcite and then further adapted into a numerical procedure  @xcite .    at the same time",

    ", the problem could be reduced to solving for their coefficients numerically .",
    "the simple analytic extraction of triangle and bubble coefficients was the focus of the work by one of the authors  @xcite , where the known analytic behavior of the integrand was used to straightforwardly extract the bubble and triangle coefficients . a numerical adaptation of this procedure suitable for automation",
    "was then presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the investigation of the one - loop integral itself has also presented new directions to explore .",
    "britto et al .",
    "@xcite showed how the integral when written in a canonical form can be directly integrated .",
    "this procedure was developed further to produce new results  @xcite and also to provide a general analytic structure for the coefficients of one - loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "taking further advantage of the analytic properties of the two - particle cut amplitude , mastrolia  @xcite applied stokes theorem and a generalized residue theorem to compute bubble coefficients via direct integration .    extending the four - dimensional cut techniques to @xmath0 dimensions ( in dimensional regularization )",
    "has also provided a second very fruitful approach for the computation of the rational terms . in @xmath0 dimensions",

    "@xcite involves splitting the rational computation into two pieces .",
    "one part is computed from the one - loop integrand and is an extension to the original opp approach , while the second part comes from a reduced form of feynman diagrams .",

    "we can express any amplitude in terms of some basic color ( and coupling ) factors which are multiplied by color - ordered subamplitudes , or primitive amplitudes .",

    "we briefly review the on - shell recursion relations for tree level amplitudes found and proved in refs .",
    "a recursive approach at loop level is not quite so straightforward , as we will discuss in section  [ recursion ] .    at tree level ,",
    "the on - shell recursion relations rely on general properties of complex functions as well as on factorization properties of scattering amplitudes . the proof  @xcite of the tree - level relations employs a parameter - dependent complex continuation `` @xmath17 '' , or `` shift '' , of two of the external massless spinors , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in an @xmath9-point process , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a complex number .",

    "these poles arise only from the shifted propagators of the amplitude .",

    "at tree level in qcd , one can always find complex continuations where this boundary condition vanishes .",

    "that is , theories with unbroken supersymmetries do not contain purely rational terms that are not associated with any of the integrals in the basis .",

    "the problem of computing eq .",

    "the nature of eq .",
    "( [ integralbasis ] ) suggests the use of unitarity cuts to isolate particular integral coefficients . at the most basic level",
    "a unitary cut effectively replaces a propagator with an on - shell delta function , i.e. we `` cut '' the propagator with the replacement , @xmath59 in the original unitarity approach  @xcite only two propagators were cut but more recent developments have highlighted the benefits of applying multiple cuts @xcite .",
    "the application of multiple cuts is known as generalized unitarity and has become the foundation of the most recent developments in the literature .",
    "our starting point is the form of eq .",
    "( [ integralbasis ] ) decomposed in the @xmath49 basis , we postpone the discussion of the general @xmath0-dimensional case using @xmath51 to section  [ section : d - dimensional_generalized_unitarity ] .",
    "the purely rational terms are independent of any possible cuts in four dimensions and therefore only the remaining `` cut - constructible '' pieces are accessible via a unitarity technique .",
    "we apply a number of cuts to the expression of the one - loop amplitude and match this expression to that of the basis decomposition , eq .",
    "( [ integralbasis ] ) , with the same set of cuts applied .",
    "this allows us to directly relate the cut expression to the basis integral coefficients .",
    "this procedure is repeated with as many different sets of cuts as is needed to compute all the basis coefficients . rather than actually applying the cuts to the full expression for the one loop amplitude , computed for example with feynman diagrams , we construct the cut expression simply by multiplying appropriate on - shell tree amplitudes together .",
    "this allows us to take advantage of efficient , compact forms of tree amplitudes produced via recursion relations , for example those of section  [ treerecursion ] .",
    "below , we describe two unitarity approaches for the extraction of integral coefficients . they both utilize knowledge of the _ integrand _ , @xmath60 , of the one - loop amplitude , @xmath61 , to derive the basis integral coefficients .",
    "the first , described in section  [ section : genuni ] , is based upon the examination of the behavior of the loop integrand and the loop momenta in the complex plane .",
    "the second , described in section  [ section : opp ] , known as the ossola , papadopoulos and pittau ( opp ) method , relies upon computing the coefficients of the general structure of the loop integrand itself .      in general",
    "we want to isolate as few basis integral coefficients as possible with each cut that we consider .",
    "it is easy to see that a quadruple cut can be used to isolate , on the basis side , a single box coefficient .",
    "there are not enough propagators in the bubble and triangle integrals to accommodate so many cuts .",
    "the set of cuts we require to compute all box coefficients corresponds simply to all possible boxes that could be present .      a very straightforward way to extract a specific box coefficient from a quadruple cut expression",
    "was proposed by britto et al . in  @xcite .",
    "the momentum circulating inside a loop without cuts is off - shell and can therefore be parametrized in terms of four free components . applying a cut to one of the propagators in the expression of the one - loop amplitude",
    "reduces the number of free components in this loop momentum by one .",
    "second , third and fourth cuts will then reduce the number of free components to zero .",
    "the loop momentum for the box is then completely frozen by the four delta - function constraints .",
    "the desired scalar box coefficient can now be read off from the resulting rational expression , @xmath62    the coefficient is a product of four tree amplitudes that sit at the four corners of the cut box as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ box_coeff ] .",
    "the momenta flowing into the trees satisfy the four cut constraints .",
    "in general there are two possible solutions to the constraints parameterizing the box .",
    "for example with at least one massless leg ( leg 1 ) we have  @xcite , @xmath63 inserting each solution into the product of four trees at each corner and then summing the two results gives the complete box coefficient , @xmath64 further discussion on the use of both solutions and alternative approaches can be found in  @xcite .",
    "to compute triangle coefficients , we first apply a triple cut to our one - loop amplitude .",
    "unlike the box case , this cut isolates not just a single triangle but also any boxes which also contain the same triple cut .",
    "furthermore we are left with a loop integral with a single free component .",
    "our cut expression therefore still depends upon the loop integration . to extract the triangle coefficient isolated by the triple cut therefore requires two steps",
    "first , we must remove the boxes polluting the triple cut expression .",
    "then we must relate the triangle integral , which depends upon the remaining free loop - parameter , to the scalar triangle basis integral .",
    "as was first proposed in  @xcite , both issues can be solved simultaneously by examining the analytic behavior of the triple cut expression in the free parameter @xmath65 of the loop momentum .",
    "we choose the following specific parametrization of the loop momentum , @xmath66 the massless momenta @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 with @xmath69 .    by definition ,",
    "any box terms containing our chosen triple cut will also contain an additional propagator , @xmath70 . inserting the parametrization for @xmath71 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol_for_l_in_3_mass ] ) into this additional propagator leads to the development of two poles , @xmath72 , in the propagator @xmath73 .",
    "we can take advantage of the occurrence of these poles to separate the box terms from the triangle pieces .",
    "the numerators of these box poles are given by an effective quadruple cut generated by the extra pole along with the original triple - cut .",
    "as we have seen above , the quadruple cut of a box actually corresponds to one of the two contributions in the construction of a box coefficient .",
    "therefore each box term can be written as a sum of two residue terms , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the residue corresponding to the box coefficient of the pole @xmath76 and @xmath77 a constant factor depending upon the box in question .",
    "analytically , in order to remove these box terms we simply expand the parametrized triple cut integrand expression around @xmath78 .",
    "the box terms behave as @xmath79 in this limit and thus drop out . taking a parameter",
    "to infinity numerically is problematic , so instead we use a different approach in the computer code ` blackhat `  @xcite .",
    "considering @xmath65 as a complex parameter , the box terms appear as poles in the complex plane of @xmath65 , whereas the triangle coefficient is at the origin of the @xmath65 plane . to remove the box terms we simply systematically `` clean '' the complex plane by subtracting all box pole terms from our triple cut expression .",
    "a final complication to both numerical and analytic approaches is the presence of the @xmath80 factor in the box propagator . to account for this",
    "we add back the sum of all box terms evaluated at @xmath81 , i.e. add @xmath82 for each box term .",
    "an alternative approach to this last step and further discussion on the analytic properties of the three - mass triangle can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the application of on - shell recursion to the computation of certain triangle coefficients can be found in  @xcite .    after the elimination of box terms we are left with a finite power series in @xmath65 , @xmath83 where the @xmath58 are rational coefficients .",
    "the upper and lower limits @xmath84 of the sum is determined by the theory in question , for example @xmath85 for renormalizable theories . to relate this sum of terms to the scalar triangle",
    "integral we first note that , for this particular parametrization , the integrals over any power of @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tri_int_exp ] ) vanish as proved in  @xcite .",
    "then the only remaining term , @xmath86 , is in the form of a rational coefficient multiplying a scalar triangle integral . in an analytic formalism",
    "the series expansion around @xmath78 will automatically isolate this term .",
    "so we can directly relate this sole remaining term to the desired coefficient of the basis triangle integral we have isolated with our triple cut .",
    "numerically , our final step is to note that , since the power series in @xmath65 terminates at a finite power , @xmath9 , the full contour integral is equivalent to a discrete fourier projection  @xcite with @xmath87 evaluation points . the triangle coefficient is therefore given by , @xmath88 the arbitrary complex number @xmath89 is the radius of the numerical fourier projection , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .      the computation of bubble coefficients proceeds along similar lines as above .",
    "a two - particle cut isolates a single bubble coefficient , but will also capture triangles and boxes which share the same cut .",
    "again we use the differing analytic properties of the terms with additional propagators to separate the triangle and box terms from the bubble coefficient .    as before ,",
    "we start from a specially chosen parametrization of the loop momentum .",
    "a two - particle cut leaves two free parameters , @xmath90 and @xmath21 .",

    "contained inside this expression are a single triangle , isolated by the effective triple cut , and possibly box terms with the same cut .",
    "unfortunately , the more complicated structure of the momentum parametrization and the bubble integrand means that a simple extension of the triangle procedure is not so straightforward .",
    "this is because for the parametrization  ( [ twoparticleparametrization ] ) the integrals over positive powers of @xmath90 are non - zero , and given by , @xmath96 the integrals over powers of @xmath21 still vanish .",
    "we must therefore alter our approach for extracting the bubble coefficient .",
    "as before , we discard any terms in the expansion around @xmath97 that depend upon @xmath21 , but we must retain the coefficients of all powers of @xmath90 ( which are all guaranteed to be positive due to our parametrization choice ) . for a renormalizable theory the maximum power is @xmath98 .",
