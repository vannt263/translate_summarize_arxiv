    "determinations of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements  [ 1 ] provide important checks on the consistency of the standard model and ways to search for new physics . in decades , several methods have been discussed to provide interior angles @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 of the unitarity triangle . the @xmath0 measurement is still on the way since the measurement has been statistically limited even with modern electron - positron b factories .",
    "two of those analyses to evaluate @xmath0 are reported here .",
    "as space is limited , belle experiment and kekb accelerator are not explained here . detailed description of the belle detector is found elsewhere  [ 2 ] .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath10 analysis of the @xmath11 system provides a theoretically clean measurement of the product @xmath12  [ 3 ] , where @xmath13 is the ratio of the magnitudes of the doubly cabibbo - suppressed decay amplitude to the cabibbo - favoured decay amplitude . unlike the @xmath14 process",
    ", @xmath2 , which is predominantly a spectator process with a @xmath15 transition , does not have contributions from @xmath16 decays to the same final state and can provide clean experimental access to @xmath17 . assuming su(3 ) flavour symmetry between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath17 is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the cabibbo angle , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the meson form factors , and the @xmath24 s stand for the corresponding branching fractions . the @xmath2 process , in addition , does not have a penguin loop contribution and hence can in principle be used to determine @xmath25  [ 4 ] .",
    "the decay @xmath2 does not have a contribution from the @xmath26-exchange amplitude , as the quark - antiquark pair with the same flavor , required for such a diagram , is absent from the final state .",
    "we assume the @xmath26-exchange contributions in @xmath27 to be negligible , in making the correspondence between @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the @xmath17 calculation .",
    "the size of the w - exchange diagram can be estimated from the @xmath3 decay , which proceeds only via @xmath26 exchange . the @xmath3 branching fraction was expected to be enhanced due to rescattering effects  [ 5 , 6 ] . here",
    "we briefly report an improved measurement of the branching fractions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 with a data sample consisting of @xmath30 @xmath31 pairs .",
    "detailed description of the analysis is found elsewhere  [ 7 ] .",
    "the signal is reconstructed in three @xmath32 modes : @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 . after applying belle",
    "standard event selection criteria , we obtained results of fits  ( figure 1 ) summarized in table 1 .",
    "the significance is defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the likelihoods for the best fit and with the signal branching fraction fixed to zero .",
    "table 2 summarizes the systematic uncertainties involved .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty is obtained by adding these contributions in quadrature .",

    "among various methods to measure the angle @xmath0 using @xmath10 violation in @xmath95 decays  [ 10 - 14 ] , three body final states such as @xmath96 have been suggested as promising modes for the extraction of @xmath0  [ 15 ] . assuming no @xmath10 asymmetry in neutral @xmath97 decays , the amplitude of the neutral @xmath97 decays from @xmath98 as a function of dalitz plot variables @xmath99 and @xmath100 is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the amplitude of the @xmath103 decay , @xmath104 is the ratio of the magnitudes of the two interfering amplitudes , and @xmath105 is the strong phase difference between them .",
