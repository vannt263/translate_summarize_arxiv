    "we have established that the unmodified hydrostatic reconstruction scheme for the saint venant system with topography satisfies a fully discrete entropy inequality with error term , in the case when the homogeneous numerical flux is the kinetic one with the maxwellian .",
    "this inequality is obtained as the integral with respect to the kinetic variable @xmath21 of a discrete kinetic entropy inequality with error term .",
    "these error terms are not present in the case when the entropy dissipation is linearized with respect to the timestep @xmath306 ( or equivalently in the semi - discrete case ) .",
    "they come from the less dissipative nature of explicit schemes with respect to their semi - discrete versions , as appears clearly in the case without topography of lemma [ lemma : seminotopo ] . in the case with topography",
    ", the identity enables to write the entropy dissipation as a sum of the one for the semi - discrete scheme plus an error term @xmath227 which has the wrong sign , and which is merely quadratic in @xmath306 , see - . in general , the second - order in @xmath306 terms appearing in the entropy dissipation are dominated ( under a cfl condition ) by the linear in @xmath306 dissipation terms .",
