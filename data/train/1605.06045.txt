    "the behavior of many complex systems in the real world can be better understood and explained through network theory@xcite .",
    "highway traffic , power outages , the relationship between businesses and many other phenomena can be modeled as networks .",
    "additionally , many of the real networks , such as the communications network and the power grid are interdependent on each other@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be discussed in terms of mutual percolation : in order to function properly , a node in each network must be connected to the giant component of its network and must be supported by an interdependent node in the other network .",
    "a failure of a fraction @xmath15 of nodes in one network will lead to failures in the other network .",
    "this will either cause both networks to eventually stabilize , preserving their giant components , or to completely collapse .",
    "the communication network and the power grid network are examples of such interdependent networks , embedded in space .",
    "a blackout in a city may cause a server operating the power grid to go down , and this may cause further disruption of power stations .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that the interdependent nodes in the two networks are not located far away from each other .",
    "another example is the network of seaports and the network of national highways , which are interdependent on each other .",
    "hurricane sandy demonstrated that if a seaport gets damaged , the city to which it supplies fuel will become isolated from the highway network .",
    "similarly , a city without fuel for trucks can not supply a seaport properly , and the seaport will not be able to function well @xcite .",
    "often , real world interdependent networks contain nodes which are embedded in a two dimensional surface or in a three - dimensional space @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of a dependence on distance , according to which a node in network a can be interdependent with a node in network b , only if the distance between these two nodes does not exceed a value , @xmath1 .",
    "the constraint on the length of these interdependency links will significantly affect the mutual percolation of the two networks and will alter the properties of the system s collapse .",
    "they found that for @xmath16 , the collapse transition in two two - dimensional lattice networks is identical to the classical percolation problem on one two dimensional lattice@xcite . as @xmath1 increases , the critical percolation threshold , @xmath17 , increases , but the transition remains a second order transition . in a second order transition ,",
    "the size of the surviving mutual giant component of the system gradually approaches zero as the fraction @xmath18 approaches @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath1 reaches a critical value , @xmath19 , the transition suddenly becomes a first order transition , in which either the majority of the nodes survive , or the networks are completely destroyed . as @xmath1 increases further , @xmath17 starts to decrease until , for @xmath20 , it reaches the value characteristic of the mutual percolation on the lattices with random interdependency links . in the interval @xmath21 , the cascading failures lead to a small hole which starts to grow circularly until all the nodes of both lattices",
    "are wiped out .",
    "the explanation of this phenomena , by li _ et .",
    "@xcite was based on the idea that cascading failures in this regime propagate by the destruction of nodes close to the perimeter of the hole that is larger than @xmath1",
    ". this will happen because such nodes have lost their supporting nodes in the other network , previously located in the hole . for small @xmath1",
    ", @xmath17 is close enough to the @xmath17 of classical percolation , @xmath22 , at which the size of the holes diverge , so that holes larger than @xmath1 appear at the first stage of the cascade .",
    "however as @xmath1 grows , @xmath17 also grows and eventually the typical size of the holes , dictated by the correlation length of the classical percolation becomes equal to @xmath1 .",
    "when this happens , the system becomes metastable : a random formation of a hole of a sufficient size by a local density fluctuation causes the circular growth of such a hole , destroying the entire system . as @xmath1 increases in the vicinity of @xmath23 , a smaller value of @xmath18",
    "is needed to produce a hole of size @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 starts to decrease for @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that all of these interesting phenomena are related to the presence of the surface of a hole which is valid only in an object of a finite dimension .",
    "indeed , one can more generally study the problem of a propagating @xmath25 dimensional interface on a d - dimensional lattice based on the mutual percolation rules discussed above , with the maximal interdependence distance @xmath1 and the initial density of surviving sites @xmath18 .",
    "the process of this propagation is similar to the various models of fluid propagation in disordered media @xcite which are characterized by the depinning transition : i.e. there is a critical threshold @xmath26 above which the interface is completely blocked by the obstacles , but below which the velocity of the interface propagation is finite , and gradually decreases to zero when approaching the critical threshold : @xmath27 .",
    "the depinning transition is a second order transition characterized by several critical exponents , one of which is @xmath28 .",
    "the fluid propagation near @xmath26 is characterized by avalanches : one remaining active site in a completely blocked interface can create an avalanche of propagation .",
    "the size distribution of the avalanches obeys a power law similar to the distribution of the cluster sizes in percolation theory . in the mutual percolation model",
    ", @xmath29 of the interface propagation increases with @xmath1 from the value @xmath22 of classical percolation theory at @xmath16 , to the value 1 at @xmath30 . if @xmath31 the interface propagates freely through the system even if the lattice is completely intact .",
    "when @xmath32 is close to the percolation threshold @xmath22 , the correlation length of percolation , @xmath33 , is greater than @xmath1 .",
    "this means that there are always holes of size greater than @xmath1 , and the interface is always spontaneously created .",
    "the interface will start to propagate from many different places .",
    "however , if @xmath18 is close to @xmath32 from above , the propagation will stop leaving a sponge - like mutual giant component with holes of all possible sizes .",
    "the death of a single node may disconnect a huge portion of the mutual giant component and may dramatically reduce its size .",
    "hence there is a broad distribution of the sizes of the mutual giant component , which is one of the characteristic of a second order phase transition .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath32 is far above @xmath17 , for large values of @xmath1 , the size of the holes is smaller than @xmath1 and the interface can not be created spontaneously ; so , one must reduce @xmath18 in order for a hole of size @xmath1 to be created .",
    "as the value of @xmath1 considered is larger , the value of @xmath18 required to create such a hole decreases .",
    "once the hole is created , its interface starts to propagate freely because @xmath34 , and it will wipe out the entire lattice . in this scenario , for small @xmath1 the critical threshold of the mutual percolation is @xmath35 , which increases with @xmath1 , until @xmath36 . in that interval ,",
    "the transition is second order .",
    "but , for @xmath37 , @xmath17 starts to decrease following the equation @xmath38 and the transition becomes first order .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath39 at which the transition becomes the first order and @xmath40 at which @xmath17 starts to decrease may not exactly coincide .",
    "there is always a probability that a hole of size @xmath41 may appear in a large enough system .",
    "thus for @xmath24 , one can expect the average @xmath17 to be in between the increasing function @xmath29 and the decreasing function @xmath42 defined by the equation @xmath43=r$ ] , and hence may still increase until it reaches its maximum at @xmath40 .",
    "one would expect that the value of @xmath44 should depend on the system size .    in a random - regular ( rr )",
    "graph of degree @xmath45 , which can be regarded as an infinitely dimensional lattice , the surface is not a well defined concept , because its dimensionality is equal to the dimensionality of the entire graph .",
    "thus , one can hypothesize that for two interdependent identical rr networks , in which the notion of distance is defined as the shortest path between a pair of nodes , @xmath17 should monotonically increase with @xmath1 , and the transition should become a first order transition for very small @xmath1 . indeed , the work of kornbluth _ et al._@xcite confirmed this hypothesis , showing that for @xmath46 , @xmath9 .",
    "for the case ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , a first order phase transition is closely followed by a second order phase transition at a smaller @xmath18 , and for @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "one can expect that when the dimensionality of the lattice increases , the behavior observed for the @xmath0-dimensional interdependent lattices studied here must converge to the behavior of the interdependent rr graphs with the possible existence of an upper critical dimension@xcite above which the fractal dimension of the percolation cluster and the fractal dimension of its surface ( accessible perimeter ) both become equal to 4 and , hence , the propagation of an interface becomes ill - defined .",
    "for classical percolation the upper critical dimension is known to be six@xcite .",
    "thus one can hypothesize that for the mutual percolation of two 6d lattice networks , the behavior will be similar to that of infinite dimensional networks , for which the interface of a percolation cluster coincides with the cluster itself .",
    "the goal of this paper is to test all of the hypotheses discussed above .",
    "we study the mutual percolation@xcite of two interdependent hypercubic lattice networks in several dimensions .",
    "we create two identical networks a and b , whose nodes are labeled @xmath51 where @xmath0 is the dimension of the lattice and @xmath52 is the number of nodes along each of its dimensions .",
    "each node is connected with edges to exactly @xmath53 nearest - neighbor nodes .",
    "we then introduce one - to - one bidirectional interdependency links , such that the shortest path between any two interdependent nodes is not greater than @xmath1 . in order to decrease computation time and define how the network is built , we introduce two isomorphisms between networks a and b. these isomorphisms , the topological isomorphism , @xmath54 , and the dependency isomorphism , @xmath55 , are those which were defined in kornbluth , _ et . al _ @xcite .",
    "the topological isomorphism is defined for each node @xmath56 as @xmath57 and verifies that if @xmath56 and @xmath58 are first neighbors in network a , then @xmath59 and @xmath60 are first neighbors in network b and vice versa . for the case of lattices , the topological isomorphism is automatically established due to the identical lattice structure .",
    "the dependency isomorphism , establishes the interdependency links , and we create it following the restriction that @xmath61 only if the shortest path connecting @xmath56 and @xmath62 is of a length , @xmath63 . since our goal is to compare the behavior of @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattices to the rr graphs with @xmath53 , for which the concept of coordinates is not applicable , we choose our definition of distance as one that is identical to that used for rr graphs ( i.e. the smallest number of edges connecting the two sites ) . in the context of hypercubes",
    "this metric is the manhattan metric , which slightly differs from both the euclidian metric and the cubic metric used in li _ _ et al.__@xcite , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the coordinate differences of the two interdependent nodes .    in order to establish the dependency isomorphism , while still satisfying the shortest path restriction , li _",
    "et al._@xcite created a random permutation of the indices of all the nodes that fulfilled the distance restriction . however , in our case we followed the procedure developed by kornbluth _",
    "et al._@xcite , namely we set @xmath66 only if there are no other possibilities for @xmath67 .",
    "additionally , we require that if @xmath68 , then @xmath69 .",
    "this further restriction decreases the time required for computation , without affecting the results in any essential way .",
    "initially , a fraction @xmath15 of randomly selected nodes in the first network are destroyed .",
    "any node in the second network whose interdependent node in the first network has been destroyed , or who lost its connectivity to the largest percolation cluster ( the largest group of nodes , connected to each other ) will also be destroyed .",
    "we return to the first network and further destroy all the nodes who lost their support in the previous process , or who got disconnected from the largest percolation cluster , as a consequence of the previous stage .",
    "this process of destruction continues to alternate between the networks and is referred to as a cascade of failures .",
    "the process ends when both networks no longer contain nodes that will fail .",
    "the largest cluster of nodes which spans the entire network is called the mutual giant component . in all cases",
    ", if the fraction of nodes @xmath18 surviving the initial attack falls below a certain critical threshold , @xmath18-critical or @xmath17 , the network completely collapses and the giant component disappears . we study how this value changes as a function of the maximum distance of interdependent links @xmath1 , as well as the dimensionality of the networks @xmath0 .",

    ". however , we notice that if the distance @xmath1 immediately follows or precedes the change from second order transition to first order transition , for a given @xmath0 , the system exhibits the strongest finite size effects .    in all cases",
    "studied we find that change of the order of the transition only occurs in the cases of @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( figs .",

    "[ f : lpc ] ) .",
    "these two examples are very different from each other and the changes of the order of the transition are caused by different mechanisms .",
    "the formation of the large holes as the mechanism of the network collapse is especially important in low dimensional systems in which the dimensionality of the interior of the hole and its perimeter are significantly different . as mentioned in the introduction , the critical threshold of the free interface moving , @xmath29 , linearly increases with @xmath1",
    "however , the probability of the spontaneous formation of a hole of size @xmath1 at @xmath29 , decreases with @xmath32 .",
    "this is because the probability , per one lattice site , of the formation of a hole of size @xmath1 decreases exponentially with @xmath1 , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the percolation correlation length , @xmath94 is the percolation critical threshold and @xmath95 is a critical exponent .",
    "the total probability of the formation of a hole in a lattice of size @xmath80 is @xmath96 and we can expect the formation of the hole in a given instance of the lattice if @xmath97 .",

    "as soon as @xmath103 the transition will change to the first order .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 will switch to follow the graph of @xmath104 .",
    "thus at a fixed @xmath1 , @xmath17 will increase logarithmically with the system size until it reaches @xmath29 , after which the dependence on @xmath52 stops ( fig .",
    "[ f : pc2n ] ) .",
    "another example is the case of 6d lattice with @xmath48 . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the transition looks second order ( fig .",

    "as we increase @xmath52 , the transition begins to slowly shift from second order to first order .",
    "when @xmath106 the transition becomes distinctly first order .",
    "this demonstrates that the true type of transition for a 6d lattice at @xmath48 is first order .",
    "the explanation of this fact is based on the statistical errors in finite systems .",
    "if we remove exactly @xmath107 random sites from the system in an initial attack , it does not mean that the size of the giant component in the lattice after the first stage of the cascade will be exactly @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the expected value of the giant component in a percolation problem . according to the law of large numbers the size of the giant component",
    "will be distributed around @xmath109 with a standard deviation @xmath110 . moreover",
    ", the long cascade of failures at @xmath78 can be viewed as sequence or iterations approaching the tangential point between the curve @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath113 is changed by an error @xmath114 , the root of the equation @xmath115 will change as @xmath116 , because at the tangential point this equation becomes a quadratic equation with zero discriminant and hence changes in discriminant of the order of @xmath114 will result in the change of the root of the order of @xmath117 .",
    "thus , we can expect that the statistical error of the mutual giant component as well as its mean value near the first order transition will decrease with the system size as @xmath118 .",
    "we observe this behavior for all @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the pdf of the mutual giant component near the first order phase transition is the derivative of the cumulative distribution and hence the inflection point of the plateau of the cumulative distribution corresponds to the minimum of the pdf .",
    "thus pdf of @xmath119 near the first order phase transition is a bimodal distribution with a left peak corresponding to the collapsed states of the system , and a right peak corresponding to the survived states of the system .",
    "figure [ f : bimodal ] shows pdf of @xmath119 for @xmath120 for various values of @xmath52 .",
