    "in the last five years , experiments on angular scales from several degrees to a few minutes have started to delineate the cmb power spectra ( see smoot ( 1997 ) for a recent review ) , offering a unique view in astronomy on the conditions prevailing in the early universe and the opportunity to determine the most important cosmological parameters .",
    "the current observations put constraints on the level of normalization of the sachs - wolfe effect , and appear to establish the existence of the first acoustic peak ( hancock 1998 ) . however , the small amplitude of the cmb anisotropy ( @xmath9 ) and the necessity to measure it within a precision of @xmath10 to determine the cosmological parameters with uncertainties @xmath11 , is in the limit of the sensitivity of current technology and a challenge for the next generation of cmb experiments . here , we present the results of the tenerife experiments at 10 and 15 ghz in a sky region covering @xmath12 and @xmath13 square degrees respectively of which we have selected @xmath14 square degrees lying at high galactic latitude .",
    "the multifrequency nature of the experiment allows a separation of possible contributions of the diffuse galactic emission and other foregrounds from the cmb fluctuations .",
    "the observations presented here are sensitive to scales @xmath15 ( the sachs - wolfe regime of the cmb power spectra ) .",
    "this angular range can be used to test the inflationary models , to measure directly the level of normalization , the spectral index of the primordial fluctuations and the possible existence of a foreground of gravitational waves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  2 presents a brief summary of the observations and data processing , section  3 presents the maps of the sky at both frequencies .",
    "the contribution of foregrounds is considered in section  4 .",
    "section  5 analyses statistically the properties of the signals detected , while section  6 summarises the results and brings together the conclusions reached .",
    "the tenerife cmb experiments are a collaboration between the university of manchester , the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) and the mullard radio astronomy observatory ( mrao ) which started in the year 1984 with the objective to detect and map the cmb structure generated by the sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "the observations are conducted by three drift scanning radiometers at 10 , 15 and 33 ghz installed at the teide observatory in tenerife ( spain ) .",
    "the instruments have two independent receiver channels and operate using a double - difference technique , with a beam response of the form @xmath160.5 , @xmath17 , @xmath160.5 ( the positive in the meridian and the other two displaced 81 in right ascension ) and a primary beam of full width half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath18 .",
    "the instruments are sensitive to a range in multipoles ( @xmath19 ) which corresponds roughly to angular scales on the sky of @xmath20 .",
    "a detailed description of the instruments and observing strategy can be found , for example , in davies ( 1996 ) .",
    "this paper presents the data taken by the experiments at 10 and 15 ghz until the end of 1997 .",
    "the instruments observe strips of the sky separated by 25 , this separation ( half of the fwhm ) fully samples the region between adjacent declinations allowing the reconstruction of a map of the sky fluctuations at each frequency .",
    "the strips analysed here range from decs.=32.5  to 42.5  at 10 ghz , and from decs.=+27.5  to + 45  at 15 ghz .",
    "we have not included data from the 33 ghz radiometer as the sky coverage is still sparse as compared to the other two experiments .",
    "figure  1 presents the sky region observed in a mollweide projection ; the ring represents full strips in ra with the inner and outer edges corresponding to dec.=+27.5  and + 45  respectively ( the 15  ghz data ) .",
    "the analysis presented here is limited to the section of our data at high galactic latitude ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the pre - processing ( not presented in this paper ) includes calibration , discarding data closer than 50  and 30  to the sun and moon respectively and the removal of long term ( on timescales of several hours ) atmospheric baselines simultaneously with the maximum entropy analysis used to reconstruct the intrinsic sky signal ( see jones 1998 ) .",
    "the surviving data in each position of the sky are stacked together in order to reduce the level of the noise .",
    "these stacked second - difference data at high galactic latitude at each declination and frequency are shown in figure  2 .",
    "table  1 presents a summary of the sensitivity achieved in a beam size ( 5 ) and the average number of individual measurements per pixel contributing in each of these declination strips . at 10 ghz",
    "the coverage is nearly uniform in terms of noise and number of observations ; however at 15 ghz the coverage is less uniform with the poor declination being dec.=+27.5  which is twice as noisy as the rest of the scans . from the table",
    ", it is possible to compute the mean sensitivity on a single @xmath22 measurement , obtaining @xmath23 and 225 @xmath4k at 10 and 15 ghz respectively .",
    "this difference in sensitivity is intrinsic to the instruments , being mainly a result of the difference in the bandwidth in frequency of the detectors ( @xmath240.5 and @xmath25 1.5 ghz for the receptors at 10 and 15 ghz respectively ) .",
    ".sensitivity of the data at 10 and 15 ghz [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the first model considered in the joint likelihood analysis of the 10 and 15 ghz data assumes that the same signal is present in the data at both frequencies ; this excludes a priori the possibility to have any signal changing with frequency between 10 and 15 ghz .",
    "for the reason mentioned above , we limited the analysis to the section of data at ra=@xmath26 . analyzing the five common strips at 10 and 15 ghz we obtain a signal @xmath6 @xmath4k with a likelihood peak of @xmath27 . comparing these with the results of the analysis of each frequency separately",
    ", we see that the signal is similar to that found at 10 and 15 ghz .",
    "this indicates the compatibility between the data at both frequencies ( _ i.e. _ the signal present in both frequency has not only the same amplitude but also comes from the same structures ) .",
    "however , this agreement is not complete , as suggested by the shape of the likelihood function which is broader than the likelihood function analyzing the 15 ghz alone .",
    "two observing frequencies potentially allows the separation of the cmb and galactic components .",
    "the likelihood analysis offers a natural method to distinguish between signal with and without spectral dependance ( gorski 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that the signals in the data at 10 and 15 ghz are given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the spectral index of the galactic emission .",
    "the model considers that the cmb signal is characterized by a flat power spectra along the window function of the experiment , while the power spectra of the diffuse galactic component is given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( gautier ( 1992 ) , bersanelli 1996 ) which means a change in the galactic contribution by a factor @xmath33 along the window function of the experiment .",
    "we have chosen values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the spectral index of the galactic component which correspond to two cases in which this contribution is dominated by free - free and synchrotron emission respectively . analyzing the common strips at 10 and 15 ghz in the ra range",
    "@xmath26 we obtain @xmath36 @xmath4k and @xmath37 @xmath4k ( 68 % c. l. ) for the possible free - free component at 10 ghz ; similar results are obtained assuming a synchrotron component .",
    "this value is our best estimation of the cmb signal detected by the tenerife experiments .",
    "there is no detection of any galactic component in any of the cases considered . as a result",
    "the cmb signal has the same amplitude as in the previous pure cmb models .",
    "as expected the uncertainty associated with the cmb signal is larger now as a consequence of the new free parameter in the analysis .",
    "7 presents this likelihood function .",
    "the results indicate the consistency of the data at 10 and 15 ghz , and that the level of the galactic contamination is below the sensitivity of our data . assuming a harrison - zeldovich spectrum for the primordial fluctuations",
    ", the value corresponds to an expected quadrupole @xmath8 @xmath4k ( 68 % c.l . ) .",
    "this value includes the uncertainties due to the instrumental error , the sample variance and the possible existence of an undetected diffuse galactic component .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xmath38 @xmath4k , the value of the cobe dmr normalization ( bennett 1996 ) , and implicitly demonstrates the validity of the harrison - zeldovich model in the range of multipoles covered by the cobe and tenerife experiments ( @xmath39 ) .      to check the consistency of the results we have split the data at 10 and 15 ghz into two halves @xmath40 and @xmath41 with similar sensitivities , and compute the sum @xmath42 and the difference @xmath43 .",
    "if both halves are consistent they should contain the same signal while the difference should contain just pure noise .",
    "we carried out the likelihood analysis of these obtaining the results shown in table  3 . at 15 ghz",
    "this analysis indicates the clear presence of signals with similar amplitudes in both halves .",
    "the difference @xmath43 does not show the presence of any signal , being compatible with noise .",
    "the likelihood curves of the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 data are plotted in figure  5 . as expected at 10 ghz ,",
    "the splits @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the difference @xmath43 are compatible with noise , due to the lack of sensitivity and the consistency between both halves respectively .",
    "an additional test has been done by computing the experimental cross - correlation between the two halves @xmath40 and @xmath41 at 15 ghz , and comparing it with the prediction for a given theoretical model . in our case",
    "the beam response is not rotationally invariant due to the beam switching tecnhique along lines of constant declination ; this makes the observed two - point correlation function depend on the separation in ra - dec . computing it along the separation in ra we obtain the correlation as a function of the separation in ra , @xmath44 .",
    "figure  6 ( top ) shows this experimental correlation function for the 15 ghz data . at the bottom of fig.6",
    "it is represented the autocorrelation of the @xmath43 ( _ bottom _ ) showing the compatibility between the data in the halves @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the error bars in each case have been obtained by monte carlo techniques ( 1000 simulations ) .",
    "the solid line is the expected correlation assuming a signal given by a flat band power spectra with @xmath45 @xmath4k in the angular region of sensitivity of our experiment .",
    "the results obtained applying the same method to the 10 ghz are not conclusive as a result of the larger noise in our data at this frequency .",
    "the tenerife maps at 10 and 15 ghz covering 5000 and 6500 square degrees on the sky centred around dec .",
    "+ 35  have been presented ; from these we have selected @xmath14 square degrees at high galactic latitude in which it is possible to analyze the properties of the cmb signal .",
    "the sensitivity achieved is enough to identify the most intense features .",
    "the strongest radio sources in the data at 10 and 15 ghz have been identified at the level predicted .",
    "the data at 15 ghz show the presence of a statistically very significant signal @xmath46 @xmath4k ; a similar analysis for the 10 ghz data show the compatibility with this signal , but the poor sensitivity means it is at the limit of detectability .",
    "a joint likelihood analysis of the 10 and 15 ghz data allowing for the presence of a cmb and a galactic signal gives values of @xmath47 @xmath4k and @xmath48 @xmath4k ( 68 % c.l . ) . in the case of a harrison - zeldovich spectra for the primordial fluctutions , the cmb signal detected corresponds to @xmath49 @xmath4k value in good agreement with the normalization at large angular scales provided by the cobe dmr data .",
    "both results support the standard inflationary models .",
    "the observations with the two radiometers continue in order to complete the sky region between dec.=+25and dec.=+45  with uniform sensitivity .",
    "the data for the radiometer at 33 ghz in the sky region between dec.=+35  and dec.=+42.5  are now under analysis .",
    "this extra spectral coverage will represent an important improvement to separate the diffuse galactic component from the cmb signal as was shown in hancock ( 1994 ) .",
    "the cmb observations from the teide observatory are being extended with several instruments working at frequencies between 10 and 33 ghz and resolutions from a few degrees to @xmath50 .",
    "the first of the new instruments is a 33 ghz two - element interferometer ( melhuish 1998 ) which has a resolution of 25 , with full sine and cosine correlation in a 3 ghz bandwidth and which has obtained its first measurements at dec.=+41@xmath51 ( dicker 1998 ) .",
    "additionally a set of three instruments with several bands centred at 10 , 15 and 33 ghz which are being built at the iac will be installed during the year 1999 .",
    "these instruments are designed to obtain a map of flux and polarization on a region of the sky between dec.=+10  and dec.=+50  with a resolution @xmath52 .",
    "the collaboration between mrao , nral and iac continues with the very small array ( vsa ) .",
    "operating at frequencies around 30 ghz at the tenerife site , the vsa will have the capability of imaging primordial cmb structure to a sensitivity of 5 @xmath4k over the angular range @xmath50 to 25 .",
    "this new set of instruments will provide a large spectral and angular coverage which will make it possible to delineate the cmb power spectra along the sachs - wolfe plateau and first few acoustic peaks , constraining some of the cosmological parameters at the 10 % level .",
    "the tenerife experiments are supported by the uk particle physics and astronomy research council , the european community science programme contract sci - st920830 , the human capital and mobility contract chrxct920079 and the spanish dges science grant pb95 - 1132-c02 .",
