    "looking at the time evolution of our universe we can spot several epochs characterized by physical phases or phase transitions which left their imprint on the structure and functioning of our universe , as we know it today ( see fig.[universe ] ) . while particle physics dominates for the first three minutes",
    ", gravitation has been dominant in shaping the universe and creating the structures since . with the exception of nuclear physics processes being responsible for the creation of ( heavy ) elements and the life and death of stars ,",
    "the later stage has no direct relation to particle physics .",
    "+    at times before 10@xmath0s our understanding of particle physics is based on extrapolation of existing models or new theoretical concepts which still lack experimental verification .",
    "the earliest times are the domain of string theory , which requires additional spatial dimensions , presumably curled up during the inflationary stage in the expansion of the universe . no real guidance is given as to the length scale of those as of today but the effect should be noticeable by a deviation of the gravitational force from newton s law at small distances or even additional short range gravitational like forces ( @xmath1 force ) .",
    "neutrons are an excellent tool for investigating this domain , presently exploring distance scales at order @xmath2 m .",
    "baryogenesis , reflected in the disappearance of anti - matter in the universe , requires three ingredients : namely baryon number violation , cp - violation and thermal non - equilibrium @xcite , each of which has no sound experimental verification .",
    "the inflationary epoch with its rapid spatial expansion of the universe offers such strong thermal non - equilibrium and this concept is in agreement with cosmological observations and modeling of structures and the expansion of our universe .",
    "it is thus the favoured time for baryogenesis . if it is originating from subtle processes in the quark sector then baryon number violation and sizable cp - violation in these processes are necessary to accommodate for this large effect observed ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "as flavour non - diagonal processes offer little room for new and large cp - violating effects and are ( as for now ) explained by the ckm - matrix , flavour diagonal effects are less constrained as could be revealed by a sizable electric dipole moment of nuclei or the neutron .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis is another possibility ( at times @xmath4 10@xmath5s ) , but less favoured by theorists owing to the presumably low mass of the higgs - boson and thus the lack of a suitable phase transition ) .",
    "alternative scenarios for the matter / antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe are based on leptogenesis scenarios not discussed here.following the quark - gluon to hadron phase transition the weak interaction keeps a balance between protons and neutrons . owing to the cooling of the universe and the mass difference of the proton and the neutron , the equilibrium , which follows a boltzmann distribution ,",
    "is changed and reaches a value of about 6:1 in favour of protons .",
    "this value is governed by the weak nucleon coupling constants which are measured e.g. in neutron decay . before strong fusion processes set in leading to the creation of deuterons and helium nuclei neutrons decay altering the ratio down to 7:1 .",
    "this is the starting point for primordial nucleosynthesis processes ( bbn ) .",
    "thus neutron decay parameters ( expressed in terms of the neutron lifetime ) are input into bbn calculations and are a sensitive parameter within the standard model of cosmology .",
    "+ as the universe keeps expanding and cooling down the interaction rates become very small and the time evolution changes pace and becomes dominated by the gravitational force , thus leading to huge time scales . only many billions of years",
    "later neutrons again appear as important players , namely in star burning processes with the production of heavier elements and in supernova explosions where neutron rich isotopes are key partners in the chain of r- and s - processes leading to the heaviest elements past iron .",

    "owing to their neutrality and their very small polarizability , neutrons are virtually immune to the effects of electric fields .",
    "thus , in the absence of magnetic field gradients , they only feel gravitational forces ( except at at distances of    from matter surfaces , where they are subject to the strong interaction in terms of effective fermi - potentials ) .",
    "the interaction strength of the earth s gravitational field with neutrons is about 100 nev / m .",
    "thus , in order to probe gravitational effects neutrons of very small energy have to be used which exhibit a vertical kinetic energy component far below this value .",
    "+ neutrons with kinetic energies @xmath6 @xmath7 are called ultra cold neutrons ( ucn ) .",
    "they are reflected at all angles of incidence from suitable mechanical surfaces , which exhibit effective repulsive fermi potentials of 200 - 300 nev and thus act as perfect mirrors .",
    "+ the vertical movement of very slow neutrons incident on such a mirror can be described by the schrdinger equation with a linear potential ( @xmath8 ) of which the solutions @xmath9 are airy functions . the movement is thus quantized and the probability to find a neutron above the mirror at a height _ h _ depends on the neutron energy which is related to the eigenvalue _",

    "the neutron spin is again exposed to the rf field and thus flipped along the magnetic field direction .",
    "this can be regarded as a phase comparison between the neutron clock and the external clock as the efficiency of the second @xmath40-flip is directly related to the frequency difference of the two clock systems which is presumed to be very small . by varying the external clock frequency",

    "the numbers indicate the population of the configurations assuming standard model @xmath99 coupling.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the population of the different hfs depends on the structure of the weak interaction .",
    "it can be altered by the presence of scalar or tensor interaction with strength @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the forbidden hfs can not be populated directly , if @xmath84 is exact .",
    "however , the population of @xmath15s - states with @xmath102 will lead to a feed down populating @xmath103s - states according to the einstein coefficients . for reasons discussed below",
    ", only direct observation of the @xmath103s state is interesting as it is both metastable and can be quenched to the ground state by different methods.this allows hfs analysis and discrimination against background hydrogen atoms .",
    "the population of the different states with principle quantum number @xmath15 can be calculated , the correction due to the feed down is known .",
    "it however spoils a `` zero''-measurement as it constitutes a background .",
    "so far , upper limits on @xmath100 and @xmath101 come from nuclear and neutron decay correlations and are rather poor . the study of the two - body decay would thus offer an alternative and in principle very sensitive way to measure these parameters .",
    "attractive at first sight with its virtue being discussed in several publications already 40 - 50 years ago @xcite @xcite @xcite this decay has not yet been observed .",
    "both the small branching fraction and the difficulties observing and identifying fast neutral hydrogen atoms constitute a challenge to experimental physics . a strong source of decaying neutrons must be combined with an atomic physics experiment . due to the strong background of charged particles , neutrons and gammas produced by the neutron source certain requirements",
    "were imposed .",
    "several research reactors possess tangential and through - going beam tubes which have the virtue of being traversed by a strong neutron flux but in turn offer no direct view to the reactor core .",
    "as the tube is evacuated , no neutrons should traverse it along its axis as no scattering process can alter the direction of the neutrons always entering the tube under a finite angle with respect to its axis .",
    "thus , only neutron decay products ( @xmath104 ) and gammas from neutron activation will travel along the axis , together with a very small fraction of hydrogen atoms from the two - body n - decay , only 10% of which are in the @xmath103s - state . using the munich research reactor frmii as an example",
    ", we expect about 0.3 usable hydrogen atom per second emerging from a tangential beam tube after about 10 m of flight out of the biological shield arriving at random times @xcite .",
    "the sketch of a principle layout is shown in fig .",
    "[ bob_layout ] .",
    "an experiment to study this decay will be performed , the first goal being the detection of the very rare decay itself , followed by the hyperfine analysis of the emerging hydrogen atoms .",
    "the principle challenge is the identification of the mono - energetic hydrogen atoms emerging from this decay with 326.5 ev kinetic energy .",
    "these hydrogen atoms must be separated from the large number of hydrogen atoms from the rest gas and from fast hydrogen atoms generated by protons from n - decay hitting the wall material at energies up to 730 ev .",
    "this could be done using suitable detectors sensitive to neutral particles and having high energy resolution .",
    "such detectors are not available at present .",
    "thus , the identification must occur via ionization of the hydrogen atom .",
    "-decay of the neutron at a research reactor .",
    "@xmath93-atoms emerge from a tangential beam tube acting as a neutron decay volume and @xmath93-extraction tube simultaneously .",
    "a set of collimators and shielding elements protect the measuring apparatus from a high flux of @xmath105 and neutron background . outside the biological shield",
    "the spin filter and @xmath93-analysis system are found .",
    "the latter uses a gas filled @xmath106-filled cell for charge - exchange ( see text ) followed by an energy selective magnetic energy analyzer filter and a magnetic spectrometer .",
    "@xmath107-ions are post - accelerated to about 20 - 40 kev and detected in a csi - detector . at the rear end of the beam tube",
    "a beam stop in conjunction with a magnetic field deflecting charged @xmath15-decay particles is meant to reduce backscattering into the detector hemisphere.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    resonant laser ionization exploring the doppler shift would be the ideal way to ionize and detect the h(2s ) atoms .",
    "however , this can not proceed from the ground state owing to the absence of lasers in the far uv ( 10.6 ev ) .",
    "laser ionization from the @xmath103s - state can only be done as a three step process , namely in a cascade @xmath108 with subsequent field ionization .",
    "owing to the large cross - section of the beam tube as well as the random arrival of hydrogen atoms a high - power dc laser system must be used .",
    "in addition , owing to the energy spread of hydrogen atoms due to the movement of decaying neutrons and the angular divergence of the hydrogen `` beam '' , the laser system including a resonator must be wide band , again imposing quasi - unrealistic conditions on the laser power required .",
    "+ an alternate approach is a charge - exchange process of fast hydrogen atoms moving through a differentially pumped argon filled gas cell as @xmath109 . negatively charged hydrogen atoms will be energy selected by an electric counter field ( removing all low energy @xmath107-atoms ) and momentum analyzed by means of a magnetic spectrometer .    at a second stage of the experiment the hyperfine state of the hydrogen atom has to be determined . for this to happen",
    "the neutron must decay in a small magnetic field so the axis of polarization ( magnetic quantum number @xmath110 ) is preserved .",
    "outside the biological shield the hydrogen atoms pass through a spin filter ( lamb - shift spin - filter ) also used for polarized hydrogen targets . by means of a b - field",
    "the @xmath111 states are rabi split which leads to a crossing of the 2p state and one of the @xmath103s states . using an rf field we can now depopulate specific 2s states which undergo a transition into a @xmath103s state crossing @xmath103p . in the presence of an electric field these two crossing states mix leading to a rapid quench into the @xmath112s ground state . after the spin filter ,",
    "only the desired 2s state survives and must identified .",
    "80 years after the discovery of the neutron this particle species still offers a rich and very versatile laboratory for precision experiments addressing key questions in both , particle physics and cosmology .",
    "new sources for cold and ultra - cold neutrons are planned or currently going into operation offering new perspectives for `` old '' or new and innovative measurements by much improved intensity and/or beam quality . besides the topics discussed in this short article ,",
    "many more measurements are being performed with neutrons , a very prominent one being the determination of asymmetries or particle correlations in neutron decay ( for an overview see @xcite ) . but neutrons can also be used to study quantum mechanics through interference effects in crystals , to determine the quantization of electric charge by setting new limits on the electric charge of the neutron @xcite , probing symmetry violating interactions or probing lorentz invariance @xcite , search for mirror neutrons @xcite or baryon - antibaryon oscillations ( baryon number violation ) @xcite . the physical significance of such measurements are mostly limited by the precision of the measurements themselves , rarely by uncertainties in theoretical corrections .",
    "however , most measurements hunt for deviations from standard model calculations .",
    "the interpretations of possibly observed effects thereby need complementary measurements , either with neutrons or in other systems ( see e.g. edm where atoms and electrons are also studied with equal importance ) .",
    "this field of science has seen a strong rise in attention with many new challenges being addressed .",
    "we can thus expect new and exciting highlights within the near future .",
