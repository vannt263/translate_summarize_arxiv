    "thus , the pair - potentials used to describe condensed matter systems always arise from coarse - graining procedures , where a subset of the degrees of freedom of the full ( quantum ) statistical mechanical system are integrated out . in the aforementioned example , integrating the three - body interactions over angular coordinates results in effective parameters for the lennard jones ( lj ) potential , which will depend on state . in metallic systems , integrating out the free electrons leads to a configuration independent volume term and pair potentials that depend on the global density@xcite .",

    "again , these effective interactions are often reduced to an approximate pairwise description with parameters that depend on state .    direct inversion from experimental structure factors are another way to derive the parameters for effective pairwise potentials@xcite .",
    "these almost always show a dependence on state , especially for the case of soft - matter systems .",
    "this is not surprising , of course ,",
    "since one can easily imagine that the interactions between two effective particles depends on the overall density .",

    "is well known , and usually categorised as a problem of _",
    "transferability_. for example , if the parameters of an effective pair potential depend on density ( but the explicit density dependence is not known ) , then a parameterisation of the potential at @xmath0 is not the same as the one needed at a different density @xmath1  the potential at @xmath0 is not transferable to the state point at @xmath1 .",
    "what i will endeavour to show in the present paper is that there are deeper problems associated with the use of effective pair potentials , even when the problem of transferability appears to be solved .",
    "the particular example studied is pair potentials that depend on the global density @xmath2 as @xmath3 .",
    "the focus is partially pedagogical .",
    "for that reason rather simple models are treated , with a special emphasis on the liquid phase . while many of these results have already appeared in one form or another in the literature , they are worth repeating .",

    "one might expect that the ensuing thermodynamics would again be that of the osmotic system , but now _ neither _ the derived virial nor the derived compressibility equation is correct .",
    "for the present case of a fixed @xmath176 , the compressibility equation  ( [ eq2.1 ] ) using @xmath180 does not result in the correct osmotic pressure because @xmath172 varies when @xmath177 is changed .",
    "on the other hand , using @xmath181 in the simpler virial equation  ( [ eq4.25 ] ) , i.e.  one without a density derivative , does generate the correct osmotic eos , as follows from the following arguments : the thermodynamic properties are independent of ensemble , so , for a given state point @xmath182 , the osmotic pressure is the same as in the semi - grand ensemble at a state point @xmath183 such that @xmath184 .",

    "but the apparent relevance of this osmotic virial equation within the canonical ensemble is deceptive  it only follows because it can be derived in the semi - grand ensemble , and used at a state point where @xmath188 .",
    "of course the lack of consistency between virial and compressibility routes should not be surprising , since a careful tracing out procedure demonstrates that the effective hamiltonian  ( [ eq4.23b ] ) for the canonical ensemble _ can not _ be decomposed into a sum over independent pair potentials .",

    "( [ eq4.23b ] ) .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for higher order interactions , should they be relevant . however , i stress that great care must be used when these low density effective interactions are applied at finite colloid densities in the canonical ensemble . ] .    in summary then : for a fixed @xmath172",
    ", a completely self - consistent one - component thermodynamics can be derived in the semi - grand ensemble for an ao system .",
    "but within the canonical ensemble , a mcmillan - mayer style tracing out procedure leads to an effective hamiltonian that can not easily be written as a sum over pair and higher order interaction terms ; the ensuing one - component system does not have a simple interpretation as an effective liquid .",
    "moreover , if the ao depletion potential is naively applied in the canonical ensemble for fixed @xmath176 , then the density - dependence of the pair potential again leads to an apparent lack of consistency between different routes to osmotic thermodynamics . in contrast to the case studied in section  [ sec:3 ] , where the effective density dependent potential @xmath75 that arises from tracing out three - body interactions generates the correct thermodynamics only through the compressibility equation , here only the virial equation  ( [ eq4.25 ] ) should be used .",
    "the effective interactions and resulting phase - behaviour of charge - stabilised colloidal suspensions have been the subject of much recent debate@xcite .",
    "in contrast to uncharged mixtures , global charge - neutrality implies that the canonical ensemble is the natural choice in which to integrate out the co and counter ions , to arrive at an effective one - component colloidal picture . and",
    "this explains in part why the problem is so difficult , since , as was shown in the previous subsection , tracing out one component in the canonical ensemble does not necessarily lead to an obvious description in terms of independent ( many - body ) interactions .",
    "in addition , direct computer simulations of the full mixture are greatly complicated by the long - range nature of the coulomb interactions and the large length scale differences between a typical colloidal particle , and the co- and counter - ions .    rather than attempting yet another tracing out procedure ,",
    "this section has a much more modest goal , namely to illustrate pitfalls that arise from a naive application of a very simple textbook density dependent potential of the debye - hckel screened yukawa form @xmath190.\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the charge of the colloidal particle , and @xmath191 is the screening parameter in the absence of salt .",
    "the bjerrum length @xmath192 , with @xmath193 the elemental charge and @xmath194 the dielectric constant , has been set to @xmath195,to simplify the notation .",

    "( [ eq4.40 ] ) is an integrable potential , @xmath197 its thermodynamic behaviour resembles that of a mean field fluid@xcite for large @xmath2 or small effective @xmath7 , where the rpa closure should be quite accurate .",

    "the present discrepancy originates not in the lack of consistency of the closure , but rather in the naive application of a density dependent pair potential . a more careful analysis of the underlying two - component colloid @xmath203 counterion system shows that volume terms must also be taken into account@xcite , but these do nt bring the two routes any closer together .",

    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) , the virial pressure closely resembles an approximate form derived from a two - component picture . ]    the arguments above may have repercussions for the modelling of liquid metals by effective density - dependent pair potentials .",
    "there , the ascarelli - harrison form of the virial equation  ( [ eq2.2 ] ) has often been applied , but as other examples in this paper show , it is not yet clear whether this equation is reliable .",
    "in fact , a recent careful derivation of an effective one - component virial equation within within a two - component electron ion picture by chihara _ et",
    "al._@xcite does not include an explicit density derivative .",
    "finally , it appears that effective potentials in charged systems will always be density dependent due to charge - neutrality .",

    "<S> density ( or state ) dependent pair potentials arise naturally from coarse - graining procedures in many areas of condensed matter science . </S>",
    "<S> however , correctly using them to calculate physical properties of interest is subtle and can not be uncoupled from the route by which they were derived . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is usually no unique way to coarse - grain to an effective pair potential . even for simple systems like liquid argon , the pair potential that correctly reproduces the pair structure will not generate the right virial pressure . </S>",
    "<S> ignoring these issues in naive applications of density dependent pair potentials can lead to an apparent dependence of thermodynamic properties on the ensemble within which they are calculated , as well as other inconsistencies . </S>",
    "<S> these concepts are illustrated by several pedagogical examples , including : effective pair potentials for systems with many - body interactions , and the mapping of charged ( debye - hckel ) and uncharged ( asakura - oosawa ) two - component systems onto effective one - component ones . </S>"
