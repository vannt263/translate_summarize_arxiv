    "tau decays including hadrons are a privileged scenario @xcite to study non - perturbative qcd in a rather clean environment provided by the electroweak half of the process . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was concluded that the most essential missing step to perform , concerning the study of hadronic tau decays , was the appropriate choice of the hadronic currents . the original version of the monte carlo ( mc ) generator tauola @xcite used the so - called khn - santamara ( ks ) model @xcite , and its extensions , to construct them . within this model",
    ", they are built to fulfil the leading order ( lo ) result in the low - energy effective field theory of qcd , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , but they violate the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) one @xcite .",
    "this approach was sufficient and succesful twenty years ago , but already the cleo and aleph collaborations realized , later on , departures of the predictions from data , a feature which could be expected taking into account several inconsistencies in later parametrizations of the three meson modes including kaons @xcite .",
    "this resulted in private versions of the code , with fine - tuned initializations -which sometimes violated basic principles of qcd@xcite- that were documented in ref .",
    "@xcite . nowadays , with the massively increased data samples from the b - factories babar and belle -the most of which",
    "have not been analyzed yet- , it is pressing to upgrade the hadronic currents in tauola in order to obtain as much qcd information as possible from experiment ; moreover with the perspective of the super - flavour factories producing huge amounts of high - quality data in the near future .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a new set of form factors for hadronic tau decays based in analytical results obtained from resonance chiral theory ( @xmath1)@xcite is documented . in these proceedings ,",
    "a description of the implementation of the new modules of the mc program for its user is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we focus on the hadronic currents themselves .",
    "lorentz invariance determines the most general decomposition of the hadronic current .",

    "@xmath12 is the generally suppressed pseudoscalar form factor and @xmath13 is the vector form factor .",
    "the kinematical invariants are @xmath14 , and two of the three @xmath15 , since @xmath16 .",
    "chiral symmetry relates the @xmath17 factors for the diverse decay channels in eqs.([2mesons ] ) and ( [ 3mesons ] ) , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , there is no analytic way of deriving the expression of these form factors from the qcd lagrangian .",
    "this does not mean that the underlying theory is useless to find them , as we discuss next .",
    "qcd has a well - defined expansion parameter at low energies within the light quark sector , @xmath18 , that allows to build @xmath0 .",
    "the associated approximate chiral symmetry is useful to understand the data at low values of the invariant mass of the hadronic system , but it is insufficient to explain them throughout the whole phase space @xcite .",
    "this happens because @xmath18 is no longer small for @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 @xcite seems a good candidate to build the expansion upon , given its success in explaining many features of meson phenomenology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it proves efficient in dealing with effective field theories of qcd in the low- and intermediate - energy regions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 in our context @xcite .",
    "working at lowest order in @xmath20 amounts to consider an infinite number of stable resonances which experience local effective interactions at tree level among them .",
    "this supports @xmath1 , which includes the @xmath0 lagrangian at lo , and reproduces the one at nlo upon integration of the resonances @xcite , which are active degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "@xmath1 provides a rigorous way @xcite of computing a nlo effect in this expansion , the resonance widths , of paramount importance to understand hadronic tau decay data .",
    "a model independent realization of the infinite tower of resonances remains unknown .",
    "we model this setting by cutting the spectrum in a way that resembles nature .",
    "one hopes that since the lowest - lying resonances dominate the light - flavour physics , this procedure would allow to capture the essentials of the involved dynamics .",
    "the @xmath1 , derived from symmetries , is still lacking the short - distance qcd behavior .",
    "when it is imposed to the green functions @xcite and associated form factors , a number of relations between the lagrangian couplings arise , making the theory more predictive .",
    "there are different approaches to deal with the diverse energy regimes which are probed through this decay : @xmath0 should be a valid description of the data for @xmath22 .",
