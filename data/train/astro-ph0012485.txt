    "the 3727  doublet is by far the strongest emission line in the blue and is readily observable even in low s / n spectra .",
    "studies by gallagher , bushouse , & hunter ( 1989 ) and kennicutt ( 1992 ) showed that the line strengths of 3727 and the primary star formation tracers  and  are correlated , offering a convenient means of measuring star formation rates ( sfrs ) where  has shifted out of the optical regime ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however ,  is much less directly coupled to the intensity of the uv radiation from hot , young stars in  regions than the  recombination emission , and can be expected to be a noisier measure of the sfr . in particular , the  emission depends on the elemental abundances and ionization state of the parent  region .",
    "in addition , the ( typically uncertain ) correction for extinction is more important at 3727 than at .",
    "nonetheless , gallagher ( 1989 ) and kennicutt 1992 reported good correlations of  to  and  to  line strengths , respectively , with a scatter of @xmath350% about the mean relation .",
    "gallagher obtained large aperture spectrophotometry of 75 blue irregular galaxies , while kennicutt obtained integrated spectrophotometry of 90 normal and peculiar galaxies . in gallagher et al.s sample the ratio of  to h recombination line strengths are higher ( @xmath350% ) on average than in kennicutt s sample .",
    "recently , tresse ( 1999 ) have confirmed the gallagher and kennicutt result using a sample of @xmath31700 nearby galaxies ( @xmath4 ) , finding an intermediate ratio of  to .    hammer ( 1997 )",
    "compare the  and  equivalent widths ( ews ) for a sample of 61 field galaxies at @xmath5 identified in the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) , and find that the  ew is typically about a factor of two higher than predicted by the kennicutt ( 1992 ) relation .",
    "hammer suggest that the strong  emission in their sample may be a result of lower extinction and metallicity in the cfrs sample , which contains galaxies of lower average luminosity than the kennicutt ( 1992 ) sample .",
    "hammer suggest that these factors become still more important at high @xmath6 .    using the high signal to noise spectrophotometric data from the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs ; jansen 2000b ) we also found that the /  ratio is higher for lower luminosity galaxies , confirming the suggestion of hammer ( 1997 ) .",
    "here , we use the nfgs data to investigate the roles of extinction and metallicity , both of which are correlated with luminosity , in producing the observed dependence of the /  ratio on luminosity .",
    "the nfgs sample consists of 196 nearby galaxies , objectively selected from the cfa redshift catalog ( cfa  i , huchra 1983 ) to span a large range of @xmath7 to @xmath8 in absolute @xmath9 magnitude without morphological bias .",
    "the sample should therefore be representative of the galaxy population in the local universe , subject only to the biases inherent in b selection and the surface brightness limit of the zwicky catalog .",
    "our data include nuclear and integrated spectrophotometry ( covering the range 35507250 at 6  resolution ) , supplemented by @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 surface photometry from which we obtained total magnitudes and colors .",
    "for the details of the galaxy selection and for the @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 photometry , we refer the reader to jansen ( 2000a ) ; for a full description of the spectrophotometric data we refer to jansen ( 2000b ) .",
    "of the 191 normal ( non - agn dominated ) galaxies in the nfgs sample , 141 show  emission in their integrated spectra .",
    "we will concentrate , however , on the 118 galaxies with  ew @xmath12@xmath13  for which the /  ratios are reliable , and on the 85 galaxies that also have ew()@xmath12@xmath14  for which we can derive accurate balmer decrements to correct the observed emission line fluxes for reddening . throughout",
    "the paper we correct observed emission line fluxes for galactic extinction , estimated from the  maps of burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) and listed in the rc3 ( de  vaucouleurs 1991 ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the extinction is assumed to follow the optical interstellar extinction law of nandy ( 1975 ) ( as tabulated in seaton 1979 , but adopting @xmath15 instead of 3.2 ) . observed balmer emission line fluxes have also been corrected for stellar absorption lines .",
    "we partially compensated for the stellar absorption underlying the emission by placing the limits of the measurement window well inside the absorption trough , closely bracketing the emission line .",
    "we evaluated the residual absorption using the spectra of galaxies with no detectable emission . on average , an additional correction of 1   ( ew ) was required .",
    "similarly , for  we found that a correction of 1.5 was needed .",
    "after correction , a fit to the data in a  versus plot passes through the origin . because we restrict our analysis to galaxies with moderate to strong emission lines , we are insensitive to the details of this procedure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we evaluate the range in the observed and reddening corrected /  ratio and its dependence on luminosity , and we demonstrate the effect of differences in the excitation state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in ",
    "3 we relate the observed  and  fluxes    to the ionizing flux and show that these results are consistent with previous studies .",
    "we briefly discuss the implications for the use of  as sfr tracer in   4 .",
    "we discuss how to improve sfr estimates and present empirical corrections in   5 .",
    "the implications for evolutionary studies are discussed in   6 .",
    "we conclude with a short summary (   7 ) .",
    "in figure  1 we plot the ratio of the observed  and  emission line fluxes vs.  total absolute @xmath9 magnitude for the 118 galaxies with ew()@xmath16@xmath13 .",
    "the balmer emission line fluxes were corrected for stellar absorption , but neither  nor  are corrected for internal interstellar reddening .",
    "the observed /  ratio decreases systematically with increasing galaxy luminosity , from 1.5 at = @xmath7 to 0.3 at = @xmath17 , but the range is large . at = @xmath18 , only a magnitude fainter than the characteristic absolute magnitude of the local luminosity function ( @xmath19 , de  lapparent , geller , & huchra 1989 ; @xmath20 , marzke 1994 ) , the observed /  ratios vary by a factor of 7 .",
    "to evaluate the contribution of extinction to the variation in the /  ratio and to the ratio s dependence on galaxy luminosity , we compute the color excess , , from the observed balmer decrement , @xmath21 .",
    "we assume an intrinsic ratio of 2.85    ( the balmer decrement for case b recombination at t@xmath22@xmath23 k and @xmath24 @xmath25 ; osterbrock 1989 ) and adopt the optical interstellar extinction law of nandy ( 1975 ) ( as tabulated in seaton 1979 , but adopting @xmath15 instead of 3.2 ) .",
    "this procedure results in a _ lower limit _ to the actual reddening , as the observed balmer decrement will be weighted to the regions of lowest line - of - sight extinction ( kennicutt 1998a ) .",
    "other studies suggest , however , that this approach gives a reasonable estimate of the extinction ( , calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ; buat & xu 1996 ) , except for the dustiest regions in a galaxy .",
    "figure  2__a _ _ is the same as figure  1 except that we include only the 85 galaxies with ew()@xmath16@xmath14 , where we could measure the balmer decrement reliably .",
    "comparison of figures  1 and 2__a _ _ indicates that exclusion of the galaxies with fainter  emission is unlikely to bias our discussion .    in figure  2__b _ _ we present reddening corrected ratios of the and  emission line fluxes versus absolute @xmath9 magnitude on the same scale as figure  2__a__. the dependence of /  on galaxy luminosity decreases markedly after correction for interstellar reddening : the slope of a linear least - squares fit to the data changes from 0.087 dex / mag to 0.035 dex / mag and both the total scatter and the scatter around the fit decrease from 0.18 to 0.09 dex and from 0.12 to 0.08 dex .",
    "this statistic is similar to the rms , but is less sensitive to outlying data values , @xmath26 , and uses the median , @xmath27 , rather than the mean .",
    "] , respectively .",
    "this implies that more than half of the observed scatter in /  must be due to dust . the total variation in /  decreases from a factor 7 to 3",
    ".    ratios of ( observed ) equivalent widths behave much like extinction corrected flux ratios , but their dependence on the stellar continuum introduces a dependence on the star formation history of the galaxy . if we use ew ratios rather than reddening corrected flux ratios in figure  2__b _ _ the scatter around the best fit increases ( 0.11 versus 0.08 dex ) and the slope steepens slightly ( 0.043 versus 0.035 dex / mag ) .    to show the effect of reddening on the relative strengths of  and  more directly , in figure  2__c _ _ we plot the logarithm of the observed /  ratio versus color excess .",
    "we find a clear trend toward lower /  ratios in galaxies with larger interstellar reddening .",
    "this trend spans most of the total range in /.",
    "for reference we overlay the relation expected for the adopted reddening law , assuming an intrinsic /  ratio of 1 ( , fixing the zeropoint to @xmath28}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha $ } } ) = 0 $ ] for = 0 ) .",
    "although the data points do not exactly follow the expected relation , the correspondence is good .    in figure  2__d",
    "_ _ we plot color excess  versus absolute @xmath9 magnitude .",
    "more luminous galaxies tend to show more reddening than low luminosity galaxies .",
    "the scatter on this trend is very large , however .",
    "these figures show that galaxy luminosity , internal reddening and the observed /  line ratios are linked .",
    "the trend of /  with reddening has the smaller scatter .",
    "reddening , therefore , is an important factor in the observed trend of /  with , but it is not uniquely related to galaxy luminosity .      the luminosity dependence of the /  ratio does not disappear completely after correction for reddening .",
    "might the variation in the reddening corrected /  ratios result from differences in the excitation state and metallicity of the ism ?",
    "differences in excitation and metallicity affect the relative strengths of the and the hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "figure  3__a _ _ shows the reddening corrected /  versus 4959,5007/  flux ratios for the 85 galaxy subsample . here , we used  rather than  ( note that @xmath29 after reddening correction ) to allow a direct comparison of the data with the theoretical predictions of mccall , rybski , & shields ( 1985 ) for the line ratios of  regions in galaxies as a function of metallicity . along the track ,",
    "the metallicity is high at the lower left ( low excitation ) and low at the upper right ( high excitation ) .",
    "the small systematic deviations ( 0.1 dex ) from the model are in the same sense that mccall ( 1985 ) reported for their comparison of the model and observations .",
    "the scatter of 0.06 dex of the data around the model track is consistent with the errors in the data points .",
    "the residuals from the model track are not correlated with either absolute @xmath9 magnitude , reddening , galaxy color , or  emission line strength .",
    "the tight coupling between /  and metallicity can be demonstrated with the metallicity sensitive ratio @xmath30}}+{\\mbox{[o\\,{\\sc iii}]}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda $ } } { \\mbox{$\\lambda $ } } 4959,5007)/{\\mbox{h$\\beta $ } } $ ] } , commonly denoted as @xmath31  ( pagel 1979 ; edmunds & pagel 1984 ) , which we use as a quantitative indicator of the oxygen abundance ( pagel 1997 ; kennicutt 2000 ) . in figure  3__b",
    "_ _ we plot the reddening corrected /  ratios versus @xmath31 .",

    "this is indicated in the figure by a dotted line .",
    "the /  ratio is strongly correlated with metallicity . for @xmath31@xmath160.75 ( where the metallicity determination is non - degenerate ) we can approximate the dependence on metallicity with a linear relation : @xmath33}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha $ } } } ) _ { \\hbox{\\scriptsize cor } } \\ ; = \\ ;              ( 0.82\\pm0.03)\\,\\hbox{{\\mbox{r}$_{23}$ } } - ( 0.48\\pm0.02)\\ ] ] the scatter around this relation is only 0.023 dex , consistent with little or no intrinsic error .",
    "thus , we identify metallicity as the underlying cause of the observed range in / , affecting this ratio both indirectly through the differential extinction of the  and  lines , and directly , as shown above . in figure  3__c _ _ we plot the metallicity sensitive @xmath31  index versus absolute @xmath9 magnitude to explicitly show the correlation of metallicity with luminosity .",
    "in the following discussion we use the reddening corrected  flux , @xmath34 , to parameterize the sfr since this  flux is directly proportional to the ionizing flux , @xmath35 .    in figure  4__a",
    "_ _ we plot the ratio of the observed  flux and the ionizing flux ( @xmath34 ) versus the absolute @xmath9 magnitude . a clear trend with luminosity",
    "is seen :    the lowest luminosity galaxies have the largest ratio of to ionizing flux . near the characteristic absolute @xmath9 magnitude of the local galaxy luminosity function , @xmath36 ,",
    "the /@xmath34 ratio varies by a factor of 10 .",
    "the total range spans a factor 25 .",
    "the sfr derived from observed  fluxes , in the absence of other information , will be uncertain by a factor of 5 , if the calibration of kennicutt ( 1992 ) and the median absolute magnitude of his sample is used as a reference ( see section  3.1 ) .",
    "using reddening corrected instead of observed  fluxes ( see figure  2__b _ _ ) greatly reduces both the luminosity dependence and the scatter at a given luminosity : from 0.147 to 0.035 dex / mag and from 0.19 dex to 0.08 dex , respectively .",
    "the total range of the reddening corrected /@xmath34 ratio spans 0.53 dex ( 0.49 dex , if we exclude one outlying data point ) .    as expected , reddening is a more significant source of error if rather than  flux is used as a sfr tracer . in figure  4__b",
    "_ _ we plot the ratio of the observed  flux and the ionizing flux versus the absolute @xmath9 magnitude for comparison . the total range in the ratio of the uncorrected and corrected  flux spans 0.65 dex ( a factor of 4.5 ) , less than one - fifth that found for .",
    "but here as well reddening produces a trend with galaxy luminosity of 0.060 dex / mag .",
    "we compare our measurements for the nfgs sample with those of kennicutt ( 1992a ) in order to    tie them to previous absolute calibrations of  and  as sfr tracers . in figure  5",
    "we plot observed ( + 5007)/  flux ratios versus observed 5007/  flux ratios for both samples . whereas 5007/  is an excitation sensitive ratio , ( + 5007)/  is sensitive mainly to the oxygen abundance .",
    "the galaxies in both samples follow similar trends .",
    "gallagher ( 1989 ) did not publish 5007 measuments for their sample , so we are unable to make a similar comparison with their sample .",
    "we did however compare the observed /  flux ratios versus absolute @xmath9 magnitude for both the nfgs and the gallagher ( 1989 ) sample and found them to be consistent with one another .",
    "kennicutt ( 1992a ) noted that his sfr calibration for the observed @xmath37}})$ ] emission line luminosity exceeded that of gallagher ( 1989 ) by a factor of 3 .",
    "adopting the same imf and conversion factor from  to sfr for both samples reduces this difference to a factor of 1.57 ( kennicutt 1998b ) .",
    "the remaining discrepancy he ascribed to excitation differences between the two samples .",
    "the median  of kennicutt s sample is @xmath38 mag , that of gallagher is @xmath39 .",
    "taking this magnitude difference at face value , we expect ( see   3 ) a difference in the logarithm of the /@xmath34 ratio of @xmath40 dex , , a factor of 2.25 .",
    "this factor has the correct sign , , the sfr inferred from a given /@xmath34 ratio is higher for kennicutt s sample than for the sample of gallagher  the predicted difference    is , however , somewhat larger than that actually observed .",
    "this might be due to the large scatter in the trends with , or to the fact that kennicutt could not account for the systematic variations in absorption .",
    "in section  2 we showed that the observed /  ratios strongly depend on the amount of interstellar reddening .",
    "will be seriously affected by reddening as well . here",
    "we test  as a quantitative star formation indicator .    in figure  6__a _",
    "_ we plot the ratio of observed  flux and the ionizing flux versus total absolute @xmath9 magnitude for the 85 galaxies with reliable  measurements .",
    "the /@xmath34 ratio varies systematically with luminosity , although not as strongly as the /@xmath34 ratio .",
    "the slope of a linear fit to the data is 0.090 dex / mag and the scatter around the fit is 0.132 dex .",
    "the /@xmath34 ratio decreases from 0.37 at = @xmath7 to 0.09 at = @xmath17 .    in most cases where  can be secured ,",
    "the 4959,5007 lines will be available as well .",
    "figure  6__b _ _ shows the ratio of the observed  flux and the ionizing flux versus the observed /  ratio .",
    "it is remarkable that for high values of /the absorption is generally very small .",
    "the sfr can therefore be estimated relatively well , with a conversion constant very different from that for @xmath41 galaxies .",
    "the scatter increases drastically for lower values of / , and the extinction becomes much more significant .",
    "when no direct reddening measurement is available ( , when none of the other balmer lines can be measured reliably ) the ionizing flux can be retrieved to 0.12 dex using the observed and  fluxes for @xmath42/@xmath43 . at smaller observed /  ratios figure  6__b _ _ will be useful to estimate the likely range in ionizing flux corresponding to a measurement .",
    "in this section our goal is to derive empirical corrections to relate the observed  emission line flux to the ionizing flux in those cases where  is not available .",
    "we start with the situation where only  fluxes are available . as we found above , the correlation between absolute magnitude and /@xmath34 ( figure  4__a _ _ ) gives an indication of whether a high or low normalization of the sfr calibration is likely , and may be used to give a relative weight to a set of several normalizations as published in the literature .",
    "for instance , at low luminosities the lower normalization of gallagher ( 1989 ) for blue irregular galaxies is likely to be more appropriate .",
    "kennicutt s ( 1992a ) higher normalization , on the other hand , will be a better choice for luminous galaxies .",
    "the scatter at a given absolute magnitude is a measure of the errors involved in the choice of calibration constant .",
    "the  equivalent width , ew ( ) , can be used to estimate the likely range in the /@xmath34 ratio . in figure  7__a _ _ we plot the logarithm of the ratio of the observed  flux and the reddening corrected  flux versus the logarithm of ( the negative of ) the ew ( ) . for ew()@xmath12@xmath44",
    "[ , @xmath45\\{ew()}@xmath461.65 ] the scatter in /@xmath34 at a given ew ( ) is only 0.064 dex and the ionizing flux ( and therefore the sfr ) can be determined well .",
    "the /@xmath34 ratios for these large ew ( ) are high ( 1.040.30 ) , and the star formation would be overestimated by a factor of ( 1.70.5 ) if the sfr normalization for luminous galaxies were used .",
    "ew()@xmath12@xmath44  are found predominantly in the lower luminosity , lower metallicity galaxies . for smaller ew ( )",
    "we find a trend toward lower /@xmath34 ratios , but the scatter in /@xmath34 increases to an order of magnitude .",
    "we note that the lack of galaxies with small ew ( ) and large    /@xmath34 ratios may be due to a selection effect : these galaxies are expected to have small ew ( ) and will drop out of the sample with reliable reddening corrections .",
    "therefore , the scatter in /@xmath34 ratio for small ew ( ) may be underestimated in figure  7__a__.    broadband colors help to distinguish galaxies that are particularly dusty . in figures  7__b _ _ and _ c _ we plot the logarithm of the ratio of the observed  flux to the reddening corrected  flux versus the effective  and  color , respectively .",
    "our effective colors are the average colors measured within the half - light radius in @xmath9 . whereas the range in /@xmath34 for galaxies bluer than @xmath47 or 0.95 is only 0.5 dex ( a scatter of 0.12 dex ) ,",
    "redder galaxies occupy nearly the full range of observed /@xmath34 . again , the galaxies dominated by star formation have the highest /@xmath34 ratios .",
    "the trends shown here are purely empirical , and the correlations do not have direct physical causes . it remains to be seen if they hold at higher redshifts .",
    "intermediate and high redshift spectroscopic studies like the hawaii deep survey ( cowie 1994 ; songaila 1994 ; cowie 1996 )    and the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; lilly 1995 ; hammer 1997 ) have shown that the fraction of relatively bright galaxies with ew()@xmath16@xmath48  increases strongly with redshift . hammer ( 1997 ) showed that converting  into a sfr using kennicutt s ( 1992 ) calibration leads to a production of long - lived stars in excess of the number observed at the present epoch . using the gallagher ( 1989 ) calibration for blue galaxies instead implies that 75% of the present - day mass in stars have been produced since @xmath49 .",
    "the luminosities sampled in the cfrs survey are comparable to those in the present sample .",
    "hammer ( 1997 ) speculate that excitation and/or dust play a role , and our results confirm this .",
    "cowie ( 1997 ) found remarkably little extinction in the bulk of the blue star forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath50 .",
    "the results by pettini ( 1998 ) for a small sample of @xmath51 lyman break galaxies are consistent with this general picture , as their uv selected galaxies generally show low absorption compared to our @xmath41 galaxies .",
    "the one possible exception , dsf  2237 + 116  c2 , is the reddest , most massive galaxy in their sample .",
    "these results indicate that the correlation of reddening and excitation with luminosity may change with look - back time , but the colors and equivalent widths might well remain effective indicators of reddening .",
    "the uncertainties in the sfr derived from  are of the order of a factor of 3 if no other information is available .",
    "we have used spectrophotometry for 85 emission line galaxies from the nearby field galaxy survey sample to investigate the dependence of the /  ratio on galaxy luminosity . reddening and excitation differences are the main cause of the anti - correlation between /and galaxy luminosity .",
    "both are strongly correlated with absolute magnitude and are likely caused by systematic variation in metallicity as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "excitation models match the dust corrected line ratios within the accuracy of our data .",
    "the total variation in the ratio of the observed  flux to the reddening corrected  flux is a factor 25 .",
    "the observed difference between the sfr calibrations of gallagher ( 1989 ) and kennicutt ( 1992a ) is in the sense expected from the difference in galaxy luminosity between the two samples .",
    "we confirm the conjecture of hammer ( 1997 ) that systematic variations in reddening by dust play an important role when interpreting emission line strengths in terms of sfrs .",
    "when corrections for metallicity and dust are not possible , the use of  fluxes to measure star formation rates may result in an overestimate of a factor of 3 if local calibrations for luminous galaxies are used .",
    "we show that  is a significantly better tracer of star formation than , and we discuss some empirical trends which may be useful in the high redshift regime .",

    "<S> if  can not be observed , high s / n  fluxes are much preferable to  fluxes for deriving star formation rates . </S>",
