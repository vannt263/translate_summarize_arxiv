    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which emphasizes the importance of eliminating the propagation of systematic uncertainties into the cosmic distance ladder .",
    "@xcite noted that johnson - cousins _",
    "photometry for rr lyrae variables in several globular clusters ( e.g. , m15 ) exhibit a dependence on the ( projected ) clustercentric distance .",
    "the principal ( yet not the sole ) source giving rise to that trend is photometric contamination ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the cluster core is approached the potential for photometric contamination increases in proportion to the stellar density , which rises rapidly . indeed , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) asserted that blending / crowding compromises the cepheid distance scale , since variables sampled near the cores of galaxies are typically brighter than their counterparts occupying the outer regions ( e.g. , m101 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the impact of blending on extragalactic variable star ( i.e. , cepheids ) distances is disputed , and many researchers instead favour metallicity differences as the origin of the brightening ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity likewise increases with decreasing galactocentric distance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thereby introducing a degeneracy that needs to be overcome .",
    "in this study the @xcite analysis is extended to the near - infrared ( @xmath8 ) regime , and the impact of photometric contamination is assessed for _ k_-band photometry of rr lyrae variables in the globular clusters m5 @xcite , reticulum @xcite , m92 @xcite , @xmath2 cen @xcite , and m15 @xcite .",
    "the conclusions presented do not mitigate the importance of the studies discussed , and aspects of the rr lyrae pulsation analysis remain unaffected . for example , the derived pulsation periods place _ seminal _ constraints on models since period change is a proxy for stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "in order to assess the impact of photometric contamination the residuals of the _ k_-band period - magnitude relation are evaluated as a function of clustercentric distance .",
    "the canonical distance modulus for rr lyrae variables is defined as : @xmath9 where _ k _ is the mean magnitude , @xmath10 is the corresponding absolute magnitude , @xmath11 is the fundamental mode period ( overtone pulsators are corrected using @xmath12 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath13 is arbitrary since relative rather than absolute distances are evaluated to assess the contamination and stars in a given globular cluster are assumed to lie at the same distance , and @xmath14 accounts for dust extinction in the _ k_-band .",
    "a period - wesenheit ( _ vi_@xmath7 ) analysis was adopted by @xcite to negate concerns that differential reddening might affect the clustercentric trends .",
    "vi_@xmath7 wesenheit function is comparatively insensitive to metallicity and also reddening free , but requires a photometric colour as input .",
    "the infrared photometry examined here is tied primarily to _",
    "k_-band observations , and the effects of differential extinction are not addressed directly save by demonstrating commonalities with the _ vi_@xmath7 wesenheit trends ( figs .",
    "[ fig - pos ] , [ fig - vik ] ) . each rr lyrae variable in a given cluster",
    "is therefore assumed to suffer the same ( unknown ) extinction @xmath14 .",
    "if sizable differential reddening is present , it likely stems from patchy foreground dust distributed non - symmetrically across the cluster , and does not invalidate the broader conclusions drawn here .",
    "moreover , the impact of differential reddening is minimized in the @xmath1-band since @xmath15 @xcite , and indeed , there are numerous other advantages to employing @xmath1-band photometry @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in general a reddening - free _ vi_@xmath7_jhk _ wesenheit analysis is preferred and desirable to eliminate concerns regarding the impact of differential reddening for all clusters .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are chosen to be arbitrary , the above equation can be recast as : @xmath16 the slope ( @xmath17 ) adopted for the period-@xmath10 function is approximately @xmath18 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the conclusions derived below are not sensitive to that selection ( to within the uncertainties ) .",
    "the residuals do not display a significant dependence on pulsation period .",

    "@xcite remarked that the @xmath1-band photometry associated with numerous rr lyrae variables in m5 was likely contaminated by neighboring stars ( see also * ? ? ? * concerning blended objects in ngc2419 ) .",
    "the extent , scale , and clustercentric dependence of that contamination is conveyed in fig  [ fig - pos ] .",
    "the distance moduli are systematically underestimated for variables near the cluster core , where photometric contamination is most pronounced as a result of higher star densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig - acs ] ) .",
    "psf photometry does not correct for multiple stars coincident well within the fwhm of the system .",
    "for example , higher - resolution hst photometry @xcite demonstrates that the density of stars lying within the seeing limit typically associated with ground - based images increases with decreasing clustercentric distance ( fig .",
    "[ fig - acs ] ) , and thus rr lyrae variables located near the core are susceptible to increased contamination by neighboring stars .",

    "the distribution of rr lyrae variables in m5 , @xmath2 cen , m92 , and m15 ( @xmath1-band ) is such that a less - biased distance may potentially be estimated by relying on stars near the cluster periphery ( figs .",
    "[ fig - pos ] , [ fig - r ] ) . however , the trends displayed for reticulum present problems for deriving an unbiased distance .",
    "rr lyrae variables in that cluster exhibit small random scatter , yet the extent of the pernicious systematic uncertainty is unclear ( see also m15 @xmath21 data , fig .",

    "the resulting estimated offsets are @xmath22 for the aforementioned clusters , respectively .",
    "the differences are evaluated for illustrative purposes , and are subjective and uncertain owing partly to an inability to overcome poor statistics to assess the extent of the compromised photometry ( e.g. , m92 and m15 ( @xmath21 data ) ) .",
    "the bias noted may be reduced by remaining cognizant of the trends highlighted in figs .",
    "[ fig - pos ] and  [ fig - r ] and applying robust estimators , among which median and sigma - clip algorithms are perhaps the simplest , rather than least - squares or average which are sensitive to outliers . indeed",

    "pearson coefficients computed for m5 , m15 ( @xmath1-band ) , reticulum , m92 , and @xmath2 cen are : r = 0.35 ( p = 0 ) , r = 0.28 ( p = 0.21 ) , r = 0.36 ( p = 0.07 ) , r = 0.37 ( p = 0.26 ) , and r = 0.25 ( p = 0.03 ) , respectively .",
    "pearson coefficients range from @xmath23 to @xmath24 and indicate the strength of negative and positive correlations , respectively , while @xmath25 indicates a lack of correlation and @xmath26 represents the significance .",
    "the results are to be considered in tandem with the evidence hitherto tabulated , which in sum indicates that the @xmath1-band residuals for the clusters examined are correlated with the clustercentric distance .",
    "however , caution is warranted when interpreting the coefficients .",
    "blending is radially dependent and non - linear , and the blending trends differ between clusters owing to the different radial sampling , seeing , core and apparent density , cluster distance , etc .",
    "[ fig - vik ] ) .",
    "the coefficients cited are an average for the entire cluster , which is typically weighted between the marginal to null correlation existing for stars near the cluster periphery , and the stronger correlation tied to stars near the core ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pos ] ) .",
    "an argument may be made that the trends displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig - pos ] and [ fig - r ] are tied to a ( radial ) metallicity gradient .",
    "existing estimates concerning the impact of metallicity on @xmath1-band distances display a spread ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , although empirical estimates tend to favour a small dependence .",
    "the impact of metallicity on distances to rr lyrae variables as inferred from @xmath1-band photometry is now assessed to complement existing work with an independent determination ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "k_@xmath27 photometry was acquired as part of the araucaria project for 78 rr lyrae variables in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite .",
    "the photometry can be correlated with metallicities established for rr lyrae variables in that galaxy using vlt spectra @xcite .",

    "a total of 29 variables were found to be in common between the @xcite and @xcite datasets .",
    "such data are relevant since the comparatively small stellar density of the dsph galaxy reduces biases introduced by crowding / blending .",
    "the significant metallicity spread also permits an evaluation of the impact of that variable on distance .",

    "moreover , a holistic approach to constraining the impact of metallicity on rr lyrae and cepheid distances is preferred ( * ? ? ?",
