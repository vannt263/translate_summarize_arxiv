    "the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) is an intrinsic property of some materials consisting in a reversible temperature change upon the application / removal of a magnetic field .",
    "nowadays , it represents a hot topic in the material science research .",
    "this is mainly due to its applications in refrigeration technologies which are increasingly becoming more competitive @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of the magnetic refrigeration are related to its environmental benefits compared to older established technologies .",
    "it is thought , especially after the discovery of several materials with a giant magnetothermal response @xcite , that the viability of devices based on mce materials is feasible , with a variety of prototypes which have been developed in recent years @xcite . during this period of thorough research in this field",
    ", many materials with remarkably mce have been found .",
    "they belong to different families : intermetallic compounds , heusler alloys , amorphous materials , ceramic manganites , etc . in parallel ,",
    "the physical foundations of this phenomenon have been clarified both from the theoretical and experimental points of view as shown in several review papers and books @xcite .",
    "because of the practical importance of the mce there has been a remarkable increment in the number of papers devoted to the modeling of this effect from a theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies on the mce were carried out in order to estimate the main mce parameters such as magnetic entropy change and adiabatic temperature change .",
    "it is worth noting that these models allow us to extract useful information about the foundations of the mce and they can provide detailed and complementary information to the experimental results , especially in the high applied field regions , where experiments are normally more difficult to perform .",
    "a wide variety of models exist in the theoretical study of the mce . among these theoretical models we can distinguish between two main groups .    on the one hand we find the so called first principles methods which try to obtain the magnetothermal response without any empirical information , or at least with the minimum amount of fitting parameters .",
    "these methods consist on purely microscopic approaches .",
    "two classical methods belonging to this group are quantum mechanics hamiltonians solved by monte carlo ( mc ) algorithms and density functional theory ( dft ) simulations . both of them have already been used in modeling mce .",
    "there are some interesting papers in which mc simulations are used with different materials like gd(si@xmath1ge@xmath2)@xmath3 @xcite , ( gd@xmath1tb@xmath2)@xmath4si@xmath3 @xcite , and several heusler alloys @xcite .",
    "recently , a new type protocol of the mce was proposed in theoretical studies based on the mc methods @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "dft is less used in this research field , although it has been used to describe both the structural and the magnetic phase transitions in some rare - earth intermetallic pseudo - alloys exhibiting a giant mce @xcite , and there have been very few attempts to describe the mce of materials from first principles by only using dft . at the moment , this latter approach only succeeded with simple metals like gadolinium @xcite .",
    "note that both of the mentioned methods consist in microscopic approaches to obtain the mce .",
    "the other group of models is derived from phenomenological laws like those of molecular field or the landau theory . in this kind of approaches , which are mainly from a macroscopic point of view",
    ", the final result is an equation of state in which magnetization @xmath5 , applied field @xmath6 and temperature @xmath7 are related by an equation of the form @xmath8 although this expression is analytical it is not ensured that it can be solved for each variable separately .",
    "of course , it is always possible to treat the cited function numerically to obtain values of magnetization for different temperatures and applied fields . in this way",
    ", the mce properties can be easily estimated in the same way used for experimental data [ i.e. by numerically processing the @xmath9 data ] .",
    "these phenomenological equations of state are divided in two main groups .",
    "the first group includes those equations derived from mean - field approximations , like the molecular field theory by p. weiss @xcite , the generalization proposed by c. p. bean and d. s. rodbell @xcite or the equation more recently derived by m. d. kuzmin @xcite based on the landau theory .",
    "the second group is constituted by those expressions derived from the scaling relations including critical exponents like the widely used arrott - noakes equation @xcite and others less used like the one derived by j. t. ho and j. d. litster @xcite a couple of years later .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to find some examples of generalizations of mean - field equations of state to include other critical exponents , as it was proposed again by a. arrott a few years ago @xcite .    in any case",
    ", all these models must fulfill some scaling laws in the proximity of the critical point .",
    "these scaling laws were deduced by b. widom in his , now famous , paper of 1965 @xcite , where he showed how the variation of some properties followed a certain scaling law governed by some powers called critical exponents .",
    "although there are many exponents involving different magnitudes , only two of them are independent .",
    "all others can be obtained through the so called scaling relations . during the following years , the ideas of b. widom were experimentally confirmed in many systems including magnetic materials and fluids @xcite .",
    "of course , all this scaling formalism can be transferred to the study on the mce , since the maximum in the magnetic entropy change occurs normally near the critical point .",
    "for this reason , it is possible to find power - law dependencies of the main mce parameters with respect to the applied field in materials with a second - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "this scaling behavior has been observed experimentally many times in a wide range of materials including rare earths , transition metals based alloys , amorphous alloys , and manganites @xcite .",
    "recently , it was even used to predict the concentration of skyrmions @xcite .    however",
    ", this behavior is supposed to be present only in the vicinity of the critical point . during the last years , the magnetocaloric community has been using these scaling laws to fit and predict the values of some mce properties regardless of the conditions of work temperatures and applied fields .",
    "the purpose of this work is to clarify under which conditions it is possible to use these scaling laws . for completeness , in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , we will start with an overview of the theory and methodologies which will be followed by their applications to different kind of materials and models . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we will analyze the results obtained by using a mean - field approximation in a wide selection of ferromagnetic materials with different curie temperatures .",
    "this allows us to derive the range of applicability of the scaling laws in the mce in terms of temperature and applied field . in order to demonstrate its validity",
    ", we will include some experimental data to support our hypothesis .",
    "then , we will carry out a similar analysis using a 3d - ising model , which is a microscopic treatment beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "we will extract similar conclusions , proven that are independent of the model used .",
    "finally , we will make some brief remarks about other models used in mce research regarding how they behave with respect the critical scaling .",
    "before starting with the analysis of the scaling behavior and the field dependence of some mce quantities , we must remember that the mce is characterized by the magnetic entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change that a sample undergoes upon the application of a magnetic field .",
    "the first quantity can be defined through the integrated version of the maxwell relation as : @xmath10 and the second one is defined as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the specific heat at constant field of the material and @xmath13 is the permeability of vacuum .    in this work",
    "we will only focus on the magnetic entropy change .",
    "probably the first attempt to describe the field dependence of the maximum magnetic entropy change was made over thirty years ago by h. oesterreicher and f. t. parker @xcite who showed that @xmath14 by expanding the brillouin function on a power series , where @xmath15 is the curie temperature .",
    "this empirical law was widely accepted among the magnetocaloric community .",
    "later , m. d. kuzmin @xcite added a small negative term independent of @xmath16 , which arose from spatial inhomogeneities of real ferromagnetic materials .",
    "j. lyubiuna et al .",
    "@xcite , based on the landau theory , proposed a more complex dependence ( including the kuzmin constant term ) as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are intrinsic material constants and @xmath20 is related with the kuzmin constant term .",
    "similar results were obtained by using other mean - field approximations like the green functions formalism applied by p. lvarez et al . @xcite . in an equivalent way",
    ", similar relations were derived for the adiabatic temperature change @xcite . independently from these mean - field approximations , in 2006 , v. franco et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change near @xmath15 was a power law with an exponent @xmath21 related to the critical exponents of the material : @xmath22 the @xmath23 case is a particular case of this general expression when we choose the mean - field critical exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 it was proved experimentally that materials with critical exponents far from the mean - field approximation obeyed this power law @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath21 can be calculated for all temperatures from the magnetic entropy change curves and not only at the critical point , using the following expression @xmath26    for a given applied field , the behavior of this exponent is as follows .",
    "it has a minimum near @xmath15 , ( exactly at @xmath15 for mean - field approximation ) whose value is the one pointed out previously depending on the critical exponents ( @xmath27 in the frame of the mean - field approximation ) . for temperatures well above the curie temperature , in the paramagnetic region , it reaches the value of 2 . on the contrary , for temperatures below the curie temperature , it reaches the value of 1 in the purely ferromagnetic region @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to construct a unique normalized magnetic entropy change curve for all values of applied field , which was initially called master curve @xcite and eventually universal curve @xcite .",
    "the collapse of all magnetic entropy change curves for different applied fields has been proved that it is a consequence of the critical scaling behavior @xcite . for magnetic systems near the critical point , a scaling relation between magnetization , applied field , and temperature must be fulfilled and it has the form @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the critical exponents , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a scaling function which depends on the model or the material . for mean - field models , this scaling is fulfilled with @xmath33 and @xmath34 notice that this relation should be fulfilled only in a region close to the phase transition and not in the whole range of applied field and temperature , except for some models which has been constructed exclusively from scaling hypothesis . as expected , the universal curve has been applied to different materials exhibiting a second - order phase transition .",
    "however , materials with first - order phase transitions do not collapse onto a universal curve and this fact can be used to determine the nature of the phase transition in a given material @xcite . in order to construct this phenomenological curve , we firstly normalize the magnetic entropy change dividing by the maximum @xmath35 then we choose two reference temperatures , which must fulfill the following conditions : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "although in principle @xmath38 could be freely selected between 0 and 1 , a too large value ( reference temperatures chosen too close to the peak temperature ) would produce large numerical errors due to the limited number of points  in experimental measurements  which lie in that region .",
    "conversely , if @xmath38 is too small , it implies selecting reference temperatures far from the critical region , where other phenomena could take place .",
    "once the two reference temperatures are found , we define a new variable @xmath39 for the temperature axis as : @xmath40    the representation of the different magnetic entropy change curves on the @xmath41 and @xmath39 axis produces the phenomenological universal curve .",
    "it was subsequently proved that the use of two reference temperatures was not necessary , unless there were multiple phases in the sample or the demagnetizing factor was not negligible @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , we will only use a single reference temperature for @xmath42 notice that in eq .",
    "( [ universal ] ) , we have used @xmath15 which coincides with @xmath43 in mean - field models but in general they might be slightly different @xcite . in any case , they are very close and they can be used indistinctly .",
    "one simple approach to describe the ferromagnetic behavior of a substance is to consider the possible orientations of the magnetic moment with respect the applied field @xmath16 at temperature @xmath44 according to the possible @xmath45 values of the magnetic quantum number ( from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ) . in that case",
    ", it is straightforward to calculate the single - dipole partition function @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath51 is the land factor , @xmath52 is the bohr magneton and @xmath53 is the phenomenological constant of the weiss molecular field . from this partition function",
    "it is possible to deduce all important quantities , especially the magnetization : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the saturation magnetization and @xmath56 is the well know brillouin function . here ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the number of magnetic ions and the volume , respectively .",
    "notice that this expression represents an equation of state for the magnetic system and this model will be referred as mean - field brillouin model . although the scaling relation is not obtained for the whole range of temperature , it is not hard to deduce that for @xmath59 the scaling relation given by eq .",
    "( [ grif ] ) is indeed confirmed with @xmath60 being @xmath61 a constant .",
    "the magnetic entropy per mole , in terms of the gas constant @xmath62 , has the following analytical expression : @xmath63    the magnetic entropy change can be calculated as @xmath64 at very high temperatures the magnetic entropy reaches its maximum value ( maximum disorder ) and it is easy to see that @xmath65 by applying a magnetic field all dipoles begin to align in the same direction of the applied field , hence reducing the magnetic entropy , reaching @xmath66 for very low temperature or infinitely high field .",
    "therefore , the maximum magnetic entropy change achievable for a given material is @xmath67 . in this work",
    "we do not use the analytical form of the magnetic entropy to calculate the mce . instead of this",
    ", we proceed in an analogous way as that used for experimental data ; differentiating and integrating the magnetization curves . in this way",
    "we get much more information about the system .",
    "this simple model only needs two parameters to describe the mce ; the saturation magnetization ( or only the atomic density ) and the curie temperature .",
    "remember that in this model , the curie temperature is related to the phenomenological constant , as @xmath68 .",
    "to study the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change peak we can use the scaling relation near the curie temperature and it is possible to obtain the following expression : @xmath69^{2/3}\\times h^{2/3}. \\vspace{0.3cm}\\ ] ] as it was expected , the dependence is a power law with @xmath70 which corresponds with the mean - field critical exponents .",
    "this result was previously obtained by j. h. belo et al . @xcite and of course is compatible with the mentioned behavior suggested by h. oesterreicher and f. t. parker in 1984 @xcite .    despite being very simple",
    ", this mean - field model can be used to fit experimental data with a reasonable agreement in simple ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",
    "this model can be improved by adding a new term in the argument of the brillouin function of the type @xmath71 as proposed by c. p. bean and d. s. rodbell @xcite .",
    "they showed this new term affected the transition temperature and , moreover , depending on the value of the phenomenological constant @xmath72 the transition could be of first or second - order type . on the other hand another extra term",
    "can be added to the gibbs free energy to take into account changes of volume during the phase transition . in this way it is possible to study pressure effects during the phase transition which sometimes have an important role in the mce .",
    "this model has been successfully used to reproduce the mce of some materials with giant mce and first - order phase transitions where pressure may have an important role @xcite , and some other materials like manganites @xcite with both first and second - order phase transitions . moreover",
    "this kind of theoretical models can provide useful information about the foundations of the different types of phase transitions that produce the mce @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     first of all , if we think in very basic terms there is one magnitude that will certainly induce the destruction of the scaling behavior of the magnetic entropy change peak .",
    "for some value of applied field , a very close value to the theoretical limit of @xmath73 is going to be achieved .",
    "for this large enough value of applied field all magnetic spins are going to be aligned along the same direction . then , if at that point we increase the applied field we are not going to notoriously increase the value of the magnetic entropy change because it is indeed very close to the maximum value .",
    "hence , in this regime of very high applied fields , the value of the exponent @xmath21 is going to be 0 or very close to it .",
    "this is in agreement with the decrease from 0.66 to 0.5 showed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the cases of gdru@xmath74 and gdpd . for this reason ,",
    "it is obvious that for some value of the applied field the exponent @xmath21 at @xmath15 will begin to decrease from the predicted value of the critical exponents to 0 .",
    "now , we want to elucidate which are the values of these fields for which the power laws are not valid any more .",
    "however , according to the results showed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we can not focus exclusively on the magnetic field because the deviations from the ideal behavior are only apparent for the low curie temperature materials ( when we restrict ourselves to the same values of applied field ) . therefore",
    ", both magnitudes have to be involved in the worsening of the scaling behavior . in order to extract some quantitative conclusions",
    ", we analyze the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change peak for all these materials . in sec .",
    "[ meanfieldtheory ] we have showed the expression of eq .",
    "( [ fielddep ] ) for the theoretical field dependence of the magnetic entropy change peak near the phase transition , so we can compare this ideal behavior ( which is a power law ) with the real behavior obtained by eq .",
    "( [ brillouin ] ) . in this way",
    ", we can observe simultaneously which is the effect of both quantities .",
    "on the one hand , we analyze for which applied field breakdown of the power laws appears , on the other hand , by comparing different materials with different working temperatures , we analyze if this applied - field limit has a tendency with respect to the curie temperature .",
    "all these results are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we have marked , for each material , a couple of values of applied field , labeled by @xmath75 and @xmath76 which represent those values for which the power law prediction of the maximum magnetic entropy change differs only by 5% and 8% from the real one , respectively .",
    "the 5% limit has been chosen taking into account the typical error margin of experimental mce measurements .",
    "the 8% limit represents deviations from the scaling behavior which can not be ascribed to experimental uncertainty .",
    "although these two limiting values can be considered somewhat arbitrary , especially the upper one , their modification would not alter the conclusions of this work . according to this , for",
    "applied field lower than @xmath75 we can apply all power laws in a reliable way . for applied fields between @xmath75 and @xmath77 , we could apply them too , but it is possible that we have non - negligible errors . and for applied fields above @xmath76 we should not apply any power law at all because the differences are too large . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , these reference values of applied field are different for each material and , as expected , these values are clearly related to the curie temperature . in table",

[ scaling ]",
    "we have discussed in detail that collapse of the normalized magnetic entropy change curves is direct consequence of the scaling behavior of @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we collect the universal curves for the six studied materials .",
    "as expected , the dispersion of the universal curve for @xmath83 ( the ferromagnetic region ) remains small only for those materials with large curie temperature and it becomes large for the rest , where significant deviations from the scaling laws were observed in the exponent @xmath84 this kind of deviation from the ideal behavior predicted by scaling laws has been observed before in measurements of low curie temperature materials .",
    "see , for example , the work by y. su et al .",
    "@xcite on ybtio@xmath85 with @xmath86 k , and related perovskites or the recent paper by l. li et al .",
    "@xcite , which deals with hozn intermetallic compound with @xmath87 k. our results point out that the presence of additional magnetic phase transition is not the only cause of the lack of universal scaling at low temperatures .",
    "as it was previously pointed out , with the brillouin function the magnetothermal response of a simple ferromagnetic material can be reproduced with reasonable accuracy . to show this , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows a comparison between the magnetic entropy change and @xmath88 curves obtained with the mean - field brillouin model and experimental data for a flat disk shaped piece of gd measured in a vibrating sample magnetometer for different applied fields up to 9 t. despite of the simplicity of the model , it is obvious that the agreement is quite good , at least around the curie temperature . in both cases",
    "experimental data were corrected with a demagnetizing factor of 0.26 in si untis .",
    "notice that in the case of the experimental data , even if the shape of the sample ( a thin plate measured with the field applied in the plane of the sample ) has been chosen to minimize the influence of the demagnetizing factor , a contribution of this demagnetizing field is known to alter the mce of materials change peak @xcite .",
    "this effect is especially relevant in the @xmath88 curves where @xmath89 limits would not be achieved for @xmath90 in the presence of demagnetizing fields @xcite as in this case does . with the aid of the experimental data we can check our proposal of the limits of validity of scaling relations obtained by the mean - field brillouin model .",
    "according to our previous results for gadolinium , whose curie temperature is 293 k , in the proximity of room temperature , we should expect a good power law behavior for applied fields up to 10 t. in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change peak obtained in the mean - field brillouin model together with the result of experimental data . notice how the correction of the demagnetization factor is completely necessary @xcite , otherwise , we would find a relevant discrepancy in the low - field region but completely artificial and unrelated to the theoretical model .",
    "the calculated maximum of magnetic entropy change is slightly lower @xmath91 than the experimental one but they are close enough .",
    "another important point that must be clarified is that critical exponents of real gadolinium ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) @xcite are significantly different from those of mean - field values .",

    "we see how up to applied fields of 9 t the agreement between calculated data by the mean - field brillouin model and experimental data is excellent . consequently ,",
    "as it is shown experimentally it is possible to apply scaling relations in the maximum entropy change of the mce in the usual working applied fields for materials with curie temperature close to room temperature .",

    ", all magnetic entropy change curves are superposed by using normalized magnetic entropy and normalized temperature but for negative values of @xmath39 not very far away from zero because the curie temperature is only @xmath113 .",
    "there are several aspects which might be important when analyzing experimental data and , especially , when comparing with theoretical models .",
    "firstly , we have proved in the previous sections that we have to be cautious if we want to apply the power laws derived for the mce magnitudes .",
    "we have to make sure , first , that we are in the appropriate conditions of temperature and applied field to do this .",
    "additionally , when using theoretical magnetic equations of state we have to be aware that , depending on the model , the scaling relations can be fulfilled in a broader or narrower range .",
    "for instance , we have seen that for the brillouin function the range of applicability is similar to that observed in experiments but it might not be the case for other models . of course , the power laws should be guaranteed at least for @xmath114 if the model is well constructed . however , there are models in which the range of applicability is very narrow , for example in the kuzmin equation of state @xcite . in other cases , like in the bean - rodbell model @xcite ,",
    "some additional parameters are included , so they can promote the destruction of these critical phenomena or lead to an artificial narrowing of its validity range .",
    "this fact has been interpreted by some researches as a proof of the lack of scaling relations in materials @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to pay some attention to those equations of state based directly on scaling relations like the arrott - noakes equation @xcite or the ho - litster equation @xcite .",
    "the first one has been widely used among the mce community with plenty of success .",
    "in fact , it has been used to fit experimental data with very high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the arrott - noakes equation of state was derived originally to reproduce the magnetothermal response of pure nickel and can be expressed as : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are two fitting parameters .",
    "this equation is extremely useful due to its simplicity and the two fitting parameters add a lot of freedom allowing the understanding of the experimental data .",
    "another advantage of this equation is the wide range of applicability , which has been proved to be valid for @xmath118 within errors of less than 1% @xcite .",
    "moreover , this equation has been used to extract valuable information in the context of mce such as composite materials @xcite or the demagnetizing factor @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that this type of equations of state are constructed by applying the critical scaling in the whole range of applied field and temperature , which means that in these models a real saturation in magnetization is never reached .",
    "this fact has the clear consequence that the exponent @xmath21 is completely independent of the applied field because no saturation in magnetization is taken into account .",
    "applied - field dependence of the exponent @xmath21 evaluated at @xmath15 for the different materials calculated with the mean - field brillouin model ( mf ) .",
    "notice the slight dependence with respect to the applied field for those materials with low curie temperature . for materials with near room curie temperature",
    "the values of @xmath21 remain close to the predicted value . on the contrary , for scaling models like the arrott - noakes ( an ) equation there is no field dependence at all .",
    "dashed lines correspond to the ideal value of @xmath27 and to a 5% lower value which would be acceptable .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as an example we show in fig . [ fig11 ] the applied field dependence of the exponent @xmath21 evaluated at @xmath15 for the mean - field model and for a soft amorphous alloy modeled by the arrott - noakes equation @xcite with @xmath119 as it is shown in the graph , with the mean - field approximation of the brillouin function a slight field dependence exists in the exponent @xmath21 at @xmath15 especially for materials with low curie temperatures as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ meanfieldresults ] . on the contrary for the alloy modeled with the arrott - noakes equation of state",
    "the exponent @xmath21 is constant all over the whole range of applied fields . as we pointed out , this incorrect tendency is due to the absence of a real saturation of magnetization .",
    "however , if we remember the experimental data of gadolinium in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , in the usual experimental applied - field range we are still far from the complete saturation region .",
    "for this reason , it is completely acceptable the use of this type of equations in the standard experimental conditions and in the neighborhood of the phase transition .",
    "in this work we have carried out a detailed study of the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change by means of a mean - field brillouin model and a 3d - ising model .",
    "we have shown that the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change at the peak obeys a power law according to the critical exponents of each model but not in the whole range of applied field .",
    "therefore , we have delimited which is the range of applicability of this behavior in terms of temperature and applied field .",
    "we have proven that , even for temperatures very close to the curie temperature for high enough applied fields , the exponent @xmath21 starts to decrease , reaching zero value for infinitely high fields .",
    "this is due to the achievement of the total orientation of the domains in the direction of the applied field , reaching the theoretical maximum in magnetic entropy change , @xmath120 regardless of any further increase of the applied field . on the other hand for temperatures well below the curie temperature the scaling behavior",
    "is also lost even for moderate values of applied fields . according to these results ,",
    "the scaling behavior of the mce is only valid when the energy arising from the magnetic field @xmath121 is much less than the energy contribution of the temperature @xmath122 in practical terms this means that for materials with phase transition near room temperatures these scaling approximations are valid in a broad enough applied field range @xmath123 t ) so the use of the power laws is completely justified and it could be very useful in magnetic measurements .",
    "this point was confirmed with experimental data of gadolinium .",
    "however , for materials with transition temperature of the order of the boiling point of nitrogen or less , we should be very careful when applying these scaling relations because they will not be valid even for such low applied fields of the order of 1 t.    this work was supported by jsps kakenhi grant numbers 25420698 ( r.t . and s.t . ) , 15k17720 ( s.t . ) , 15h03699 ( s.t . ) , and by the spanish mineco , eu feder ( project mat2013 - 45165-p ) and the pai of the regional government of andaluca ( v.f . ) .",
