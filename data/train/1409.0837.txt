    "our main goal is to construct a fundamental family of higher categories , namely the symmetric monoidal @xmath1-categories @xmath2 of iterated spans in an @xmath3 with finite limits , and to classify the fully dualizable objects in these @xmath1-categories . via the cobordism hypothesis",
    ", these objects correspond to the framed extended tqfts valued in the @xmath1-categories @xmath2 , which can be interpreted as a simple model for `` classical '' topological field theories .",
    "we also construct variants of these @xmath1-categories where the spans are equipped with extra structure in the form of `` local systems '' , and classify their fully dualizable objects .",
    "the corresponding tqfts are those proposed as `` classical '' field theories in the quantization programme outlined by freed , hopkins , lurie , and teleman  @xcite .",
    "finally , we apply our machinery in the context of pantev , ton , vaqui , and vezzosi s theory of shifted symplectic structures for derived algebraic stacks @xcite to construct of @xmath4-shifted symplectic derived stacks with the morphisms given by lagrangian correspondences ; we also show that here all objects are dualizable ( and thus determine framed 1-dimensional tqfts ) .",
    "before we describe our results in more detail and discuss how they relate to extended tqfts , we will first look at the analogous `` classical '' field theories in the simpler setting of non - extended tqfts .",
    "_ topological quantum field theories _ ( or tqfts ) originated in physics as a particularly simple class of quantum field theories .",
    "they were first formalized mathematically by atiyah  @xcite in the late 1980s , and have been the subject of much research over the past two decades . recall that a sketch of atiyah s definition goes as follows :    let @xmath5 be the category with objects closed @xmath6-dimensional manifolds and morphisms ( equivalence classes of ) @xmath4-dimensional cobordisms ; the disjoint union of manifolds makes this a symmetric monoidal category .",
    "if @xmath7 is another symmetric monoidal category , a @xmath7-valued @xmath4-dimensional topological quantum field theory is then a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath8 .    reflecting the linearity of quantum mechanics , in examples",
    "@xmath7 is typically a category of `` linear '' objects , for example complex vector spaces or chain complexes of these .",
    "ideas from physics suggest that one should be able to produce interesting examples of tqfts as `` quantizations '' of `` classical '' topological field theories  this proposal goes back at least to @xcite . in a very simple picture of a classical field theory",
    "we assign to a manifold @xmath9 a collection @xmath10 of `` fields '' on @xmath9 , which will typically be some form of stack .",
    "if @xmath11 is a cobordism from @xmath9 to @xmath12 , we can restrict the fields on @xmath11 to the boundary , giving a _ span _ @xmath13 {       \\pgfmatrixnextcell \\mathcal{f}(k ) \\pgfmatrixnextcell        \\\\",

    "in other words , the stack @xmath17 should be the pullback @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the cobordism @xmath11 is the composite of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath5 , so we want @xmath19 to be a functor from @xmath5 to a category where the morphisms are spans and the composition is given by taking pullbacks .    more precisely , if @xmath7 is any category with finite limits , we would like to define a category @xmath20 where the objects are the objects of @xmath7 and the morphisms from @xmath21 to @xmath22 are spans @xmath13 {        & a &    \\\\     x &        & y    \\\\ } ; \\path[->,font=\\footnotesize ] ( m-1 - 2 ) edge ( m-2 - 1 ) ( m-1 - 2 ) edge ( m-2 - 3 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] in @xmath7 .",

    "a `` quantization '' of such a classical field theory , which is supposed to be analogous to the path integral of quantum field theory , would then assign some algebraic object to the stack @xmath10 , for example the value of some cohomology theory @xmath25 , and to the span @xmath26 a push - pull composite @xmath27 , where the pushforward @xmath28 is thought of as `` integrating '' over the fibres of @xmath29 .",
    "although relatively easy to define , atiyah s notion of tqfts suffers from a number of defects , and recently much work has focused on the more sophisticated notion of _ extended _ topological quantum field theories .",
    "this was first formalized in terms of _ @xmath4-categories _ by baez and dolan  @xcite , building on earlier work by a number of mathematicians , including lawrence  @xcite and freed  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , an @xmath4-category is a structure with objects , morphisms between objects , 2-morphisms between morphisms , and so on up to @xmath4-morphisms between @xmath6-morphisms .",
    "these @xmath30-morphisms can be composed , but the composition is not strictly associative , only associative up to a coherent choice of invertible higher morphisms . we can sketch baez and dolan s definition as follows :    let @xmath31 be the @xmath4-category whose objects are closed @xmath32-manifolds and whose @xmath30-morphisms are @xmath30-dimensional cobordisms between @xmath33-manifolds with corners ( for @xmath34 we must take isomorphism classes of cobordisms ) .",
    "the disjoint union of manifolds gives this a symmetric monoidal structure , and if @xmath7 is a symmetric monoidal @xmath4-category , a @xmath7-valued @xmath4-dimensional extended topological quantum field theory is a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath35 .",
    "we would like to define an extended analogue of the `` classical '' topological field theories we considered above .",
    "for example , if we have an @xmath4-manifold @xmath11 whose boundary is a manifold with corners @xmath36 , restricting the fields on @xmath11 gives a span of spans @xmath37 { } & & \\mathcal{f}(k ) \\arrow{dl } \\arrow{dr }   & & \\\\ & \\mathcal{f}(m ) \\arrow{dl } \\arrow{drrr }   & & \\mathcal{f}(n ) \\arrow[crossing over]{dlll } \\arrow{dr}&\\\\ \\mathcal{f}(a ) & & & & \\mathcal{f}(b ) , \\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ] so we want to have such 2-fold spans as 2-morphisms in the target .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath7 is a category with finite limits we d like to construct a 2-category where the objects are the objects of @xmath7 , the 1-morphisms are spans in @xmath7 , and the 2-morphisms from @xmath23 to @xmath38 are given by ( isomorphism classes of ) 2-fold spans , i.e. diagrams of the form @xmath37 { } & & j \\arrow{dl } \\arrow{dr }   & & \\\\ & a \\arrow{dl } \\arrow{drrr }   & & b \\arrow[crossing over]{dlll } \\arrow{dr}&\\\\ x & & & & y.\\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ]    we can think of this 2-fold span as a span in the slice category @xmath39 ( whose objects are themselves spans from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) , which suggests that the general target for a classical extended tqft should be an @xmath4-category @xmath40 where an @xmath30-morphism between objects @xmath21 and @xmath22 is inductively defined to be an @xmath33-morphism in @xmath41 .",
    "this @xmath4-category should also have a symmetric monoidal structure induced by the cartesian product in @xmath7 .",
    "in the case @xmath42 we could try to make this idea precise using the classical definition of bicategory .",
    "however , this would require us to make an arbitrary choice of pullback diagrams to define the composition of 1-morphisms and then check a coherence condition to conclude that this choice does nt matter .",
    "although somewhat unnatural , this is certainly doable , but this becomes a far more serious issue when we contemplate extending the construction further to get , say , a 3-category where the 3-morphisms are 3-fold spans : as is often the case , trying to work with @xmath4-categories leads to increasingly more intractable coherence problems as @xmath4 increases .",
    "we will therefore instead work with _ @xmath1-categories_. in the same way as @xmath4-categories these have @xmath30-morphisms for @xmath43 , but in addition they have _ invertible _ @xmath30-morphisms for @xmath44 .",
    "the main difference , however , is that when working with @xmath1-categories we can often avoid dealing with coherence issues by not making any choices , e.g. of compositions , and instead , roughly speaking , checking that the space of possible choices is contractible .",
    "using @xmath1-categories also has the advantage that there is a good definition of a symmetric monoidal structure on an @xmath1-category .- category is just a commutative monoid , in the sense of @xcite , in the of @xmath1-categories . ] in contrast , symmetric monoidal @xmath4-categories have not been defined for @xmath45 , and even for bicategories the coherence axioms for a symmetric monoidal structure are quite complicated ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a complete list of the required conditions ) .",
    "our first main result then gives a construction of @xmath1-categories with the properties we discussed above is an ordinary category , @xmath46 will still have invertible 2-morphisms , given by isomorphisms of spans , and composing spans by taking pullbacks is indeed well - defined up to a canonical choice of such an invertible 2-morphism . ] :    suppose @xmath3 is an ( i.e. @xmath0-category ) with finite limits",
    ". then there exists an @xmath1-category @xmath2 ( in the form of a complete @xmath4-fold segal space ) such that :    a.   the objects of @xmath2 are the objects of @xmath3 .",
    "b.   the 1-morphisms of @xmath2 are spans in @xmath3 .",
    "c.   for @xmath21 and @xmath47 , the @xmath48-category of maps from @xmath21 to @xmath22 in @xmath2 is @xmath49 .",
