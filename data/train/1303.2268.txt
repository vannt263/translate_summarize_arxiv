    "in the last years an increasing number of binary systems with ultracool components have been discovered and studied .",
    "ultracool dwarfs ( ucds ) are defined as dwarf stars with spectral types of m7 or later , and include substellar brown dwarfs ( @xcite ; masses @xmath5 0.072 m@xmath6 ) and some very low mass stars .",
    "ucds populate the lower temperature range , from effective temperatures @xmath3 @xmath7 2400 k to 500 k @xcite .    beyond the late m dwarfs ,",
    "lies the l dwarf sequence , which have @xmath3 ranging from 2250 k to 1400 k @xcite . while for earlier types there can be some hydrogen burning very low mass stars",
    ", most l dwarfs will be substellar - mass brown dwarfs .",
    "the sequence extends into the cooler t dwarf regime and to @xmath3 of @xmath7 500 k @xcite .",
    "the y dwarf spectral type , first proposed by @xcite has only recently seen its first confirmed objects with @xcite discovering six y dwarfs from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) .",
    "more recently @xcite presented seven more y dwarfs from wise , bringing the current total of confirmed objects to 13 .",
    "the wise @xcite satellite has surveyed the entire sky in four infrared bands ( _ w1 _ , _ w2 _ , _ w3 _ and _ w4 _ ) , at wavelengths of 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath8 m . bands _",
    "w1 _ and _ w2 _ give the best sensitivity to the coolest brown dwarfs due to the strong absorption centred at 3.3 @xmath8 m ( _ w1 _ ) owing to methane for objects with @xmath3 @xmath5 1500 k. at 4.6 @xmath8 m ( _ w2 _ ) , however , there is no methane ; as such the @xmath9 colour is very sensitive to cool brown dwarfs .",
    "several other large - scale optical and near - infrared ( nir ) surveys have already proved to be effective tools at finding and studying large populations of ucds : the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) and the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; @xcite ) in the nir , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) in the optical . as brown dwarfs cool and",
    "fade significantly over time this leads to a mass - age degeneracy , with lower mass younger brown dwarfs having similar @xmath3 and luminosity to higher mass , older ones .",
    "measuring atmospheric properties ( @xmath3 , log _ g _ , [ m / h ] ) of brown dwarfs in order to infer mass and age , is thus crucial . using near - infrared and optical spectra and model fitting techniques ,",
    "one can attempt to constrain physical properties for ucds . however dust condensation , non - equilibrium chemistry and complex molecular opacities make it very challenging to accurately model such atmospheres , and the reliable fitting of properties with spectral models is not currently reliable @xcite",
    ".    one way to overcome these problems is to identify ucds whose properties can be estimated in a relatively independent way .",
    "we refer to such objects as benchmark ucds .",
    "they can be used as a testbed for prevailing theories and models .",
    "ucds that are wide companions to main sequence ( ms ) stars of the galactic disc are fairly numerous , cover the full range of age and metallicity , and are therefore particularly useful benchmarks .",
    "@xcite was one of the first to search for these systems and the method used has been followed by many other successfull studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    since the peak of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of l dwarfs occurs at nir wavelengths , 2mass and wise are ideal to discover large numbers of these objects .",
    "in fact both surveys cover the whole sky and are well matched which makes them a powerful tool to detect l dwarfs . despite their relatively large pixel sizes of 1 arcsec in 2mass and 1.375 arcsec in wise",
    ", the 10 year baseline between these surveys also makes it possible to accurately determine proper motions .",
    "this is important as it allows confirmation of the binarity in these systems .",
    "we present here the measurement of proper motion for 10 l dwarf candidates and the discovery of two new wide binary systems .",
    "section 2 describes the technique used to identify these systems and how we assessed their common proper motion , describing our follow - up spectroscopic observations whilst in section 3 we present the two new binary systems in more detail , addressing the issue of possible contamination . in section 4",
    "we discuss results , estimate a binary fraction for these type of objects and investigate the possibility that some known ucds with ms stars companions are actually unresolved objects .",
    "finally our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the ucd candidates were selected using nir photometry available from the 2mass all - sky point catalogue .",
    "this database is ideal to search for l dwarfs as it covers the whole sky and the nir _ jhks _ filters sample the peak of the sed of such objects .",
    "colour selection criteria were applied to obtain a first sample of l dwarf candidates .",
    "this selection required the following :    0.5 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath10 1.6 + 1.1 @xmath10 @xmath12 @xmath10 2.8 + 0.4 @xmath10 @xmath13 @xmath10 1.1 + @xmath11 @xmath10 1.75 ( @xmath13 ) + 0.37 + @xmath11 @xmath14 1.65 ( @xmath13 ) @xmath1 0.35    we only consider candidates with a _",
    "band magnitude @xmath10 16.0 .",
    "these constraints were chosen based on the colours of known l dwarfs from dwarf archives .",
    "to avoid source confusion and contamination from ms and giant stars some high density regions were excluded , such as the galactic plane ( b @xmath14 @xmath15 ) and the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "two other reddened and overcrowded regions were also removed .",
    "information about these regions can be seen in table [ tab : red_regions ] .",
    "the equatorial poles were also avoided ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) as 2mass is not complete in these regions for optical cross - matching .",
    "the total area of the sky included in the first sample was 22 , 178 deg@xmath18 , or 53 per cent of the sky",
    ".    we have kept objects with no optical counterpart within 5 arcsec in the usno - a2.0 catalogue or , if they do have counterparts , with @xmath19 @xmath20 5.5 . by doing this",
    "we ensure that all detections with optical counterparts are of spectral types later than m6 as these objects have extremely red colours in both the optical and ir domain due to their low @xmath3 . a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) criteria was imposed to exclude low - quality photometric data ( s / n @xmath20 5 for all the bands ) .",
    "flags including ccflg=000 , prox@xmath206 , gal@xmath21contam=0 and mpflg=0 , were applied to make sure that the sources were unaffected by known artefacts , such as diffraction spikes from nearby bright stars , and to exclude extended sources and known minor planets .",
    "this first sample of possible ucd candidates encompasses 28 , 023 objects .",
    ".uncatalogued regions that have been removed from the initial sample [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * references : * ( 1 ) @xcite ; ( 2 ) @xcite ; ( 3 ) @xcite ; ( 4 ) @xcite ; ( 5 ) @xcite ; ( 6 ) @xcite ; ( 7 ) @xcite ; ( 8) @xcite ; ( 9 ) @xcite ; ( 10 ) @xcite ; ( 11 ) @xcite ; ( 12 ) @xcite ; ( 13 ) @xcite ; ( 14 ) @xcite ; ( 15 ) @xcite ; ( 16 ) @xcite ; ( 17 ) @xcite ; ( 18 ) @xcite ; ( 19 ) @xcite ; ( 20 ) @xcite ; ( 21 ) @xcite ; ( 22 ) @xcite ; ( 23 ) @xcite ; ( 24 ) @xcite ; ( 25 ) @xcite ; ( 26 ) @xcite ; ( 27 ) @xcite ; ( 28 ) @xcite ; ( 29 ) @xcite ; ( 30 ) @xcite ; ( 31 ) @xcite ( 32 ) @xcite ; ( 33 ) @xcite ; ( 34 ) @xcite ; ( 35 ) @xcite ; ( 36 ) @xcite ; ( 37 ) @xcite ; ( 38 ) this paper      we have gathered information about all of the l dwarfs that are in binary or multiple systems , from the current literature , finding 59 l dwarfs that form part of binary or multiple systems . of these , 35 are in a system where the primary is another ucd .",
    "two have white dwarfs as primaries and the remaining 22 have a ms star primary . for the purposes of this paper , we only present the latter 22 , with information about these systems shown in table [ tab : ms_binaries ] .",
    "the distance has been estimated using parallax measurements where available or , otherwise , from photometric data .",
    "considering the two new systems presented here , the sample has now 24 binaries , with six triples and two quadruples .",
    "this gives a fraction of 1:4 triple to binary systems , and 1:12 quadruples to binary systems .",
    "these values differ from the ones presented in @xcite . however , in the latter case the authors considered a wide ucd companion sample containing all ucd binary systems , and not only the ones with l dwarfs as secondaries .",
    "our initial sample of l dwarf candidates from 2mass was completed up to a magnitude of 16 in the _ j _ band .",
    "this is quite similar to the completeness limit of the point source catalogue of 2mass .",
    "according to @xcite , 2mass is virtually complete ( @xmath7 99 per cent of the sky ) to the 10 @xmath22 sensitivity limit for sources at or fainter than _ j _ = 15.8 .",
    "our sample is thus complete to this limit and we see that all known l dwarfs with _",
    "@xmath23 16 have turned up in our initial search . using the relationship between absolute and apparent magnitude ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , for an l9 dwarf , we estimate that our sample is complete up to a distance of 19 pc ( for an l0 this limit would be 94 pc ) .",
    "however , this completeness is only valid for the sky regions surveyed , since we have excluded reddened areas and avoided the galactic plane .    in order to estimate the number of l dwarfs expected in the full sky , we took a spherical region of space with a radius of 19 pc , and multiplied it by the @xcite space density estimate l dwarfs ( 3.8 @xmath2 0.6 @xmath24 10@xmath25 pc@xmath25 ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath7 109 @xmath2 17 l dwarfs should lie within the region studied .    based on table",
    "[ tab : ms_binaries ] , we find that six l dwarfs are part of binary systems in which the primary is a ms star , including the gj 499abc system presented here .",
    "therefore , we find that the binary fraction for l dwarfs that have ms companions is @xmath7 6 per cent .",
    "considering now all the hipparcos and gliese stars , we find that 1787 were within our area and out to 19 pc . the binary fraction of stars with l dwarfs as wide companions is thus 0.33 per cent .",
    "the systems considered for this analysis have separations between 30 and 10000 au .",
    "it is worth noting that the two systems with smaller on - sky and physical separations , g 239 - 25ab and gj 564ab ( with separations of 30 and 48 au respectively ) , have been discovered with adaptive optics , since finding such faint objects so close to bright stars is rather difficult .",
    "if we now analyse the sample of known l dwarfs ( based on dwarf archives ) , and do not take into account any distance constraints , we see that the binary fraction of l dwarfs in any kind of system goes up to @xmath7 10 per cent .",
    "however , only 4 per cent of l dwarfs have ms stars as companions . we have not considered any possible unresolved binaries , and hence the values presented are just a lower estimate .",
    "the binary fractions here derived are not affected by the malmquist bias , since both the number of single l dwarfs and the number of those found to be in multiple systems are affected in the same way .      in order to identify any possible unresolved binaries in the sample presented in table [ tab : ms_binaries ] we take advantage of the associated high quality parallax measurements that can be inferred for the companion l dwarfs in known multiple systems .",
    "we plotted the spectral type of the l dwarf components versus their @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abs_sptype ] ) . to estimate the absolute magnitude we used the primaries distances .",
    "we excluded from this analysis two objects , gq lupb ( j15491209 - 3539039 ) and hd203030b ( j21185897 + 2613461 ) since they do not have 2mass _ j _ band measurements .",
    "also , we have plotted the g 124 - 62bc components as an unresolved binary , since there are no individual photometric measurements of the two l1 components .",
    "the other five systems in which a ms star has two ucds as secondaries are all resolved , and in fig . [ fig : abs_sptype ] we plot the two components with different symbols , open circle and open triangle , and numbered .",
    "the two new benchmark systems here presented are shown as filled circles .",
    "the filled squares are l dwarf companions that have not previously been considered as possible unresolved multiples .",
    "one interesting case is g 196 - 3b .",
    "the distance to this l2 dwarf has been estimated by many different authors .",
    "@xcite uses the companion , an m3 dwarf , to infer a photometric distance of 14.9 @xmath2 2.7 pc to the system @xcite .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , uses 2mass @xmath4 vs spectral type relationships from @xcite to derive a different distance for this l2 dwarf , 32.0 @xmath2 2.0 pc .",
    "more recently , @xcite discuss the system in detail giving minimum and maximum values for its distance of 15 and 51 pc , respectively .",
    "these two limits are given for two different scenarios , one if we consider the primary to be a single object and a field star , and secondly if we consider the secondary to actually be a double object with ages of 3 myr .",
    "adopting a probable distance range of 15 - 30 pc ( as @xcite conclude and in accordance with the @xcite and @xcite values ) , we estimate an @xmath26 between 12.4 and 13.9 . in [ fig : abs_sptype ] we have plotted the latter value , since this places the l2 dwarf further away from the polynomial fits .",
    "it can be seen that this particular dwarf shows redder colours than expected for its spectral type , as noted in @xcite ( this is true even if we consider the dwarf to be an l3 , as @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is still to be fully explained , although @xcite suggest the object might have a low gravity atmosphere with upper atmospheric layers or a warm dusty envelope .",
    "the l dwarf companion to ab pica has been previously reported as underluminous @xcite .",
    "this is a young system , with ages smaller than 1 gyr , and a low gravity dwarf .",
    "we note though that the unresolved binary g 124 - 62bc , open square in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs_sptype ] , does not sit above the expected position in the spectral type vs @xmath4 plot .",
    "this could perhaps suggest that the actual single object sequence is slightly below the best - fitting sequences plotted , in which case ab picb would not be underluminous , but making the position of hd16270b stand out even more as an overluminous object .",
    "just like hd16270b , lp 261 - 75b appears to be slightly overluminous for its spectral type .",
    "however , if we take into account uncertainties in the spectral type of @xmath2 1 , we see that they both fit the sequence .",
    "another interesting object is the system with hd2057a as primary , and two resolved l4 dwarfs as secondaries ( number 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs_sptype ] .",
    "firstly mentioned in @xcite , the two l4 dwarfs are later confirmed as companions to the f8 star in @xcite . as can be seen in the plot , the two symbols sit well above the average @xmath4 for typical l4 dwarfs .",
    "in fact , one of the dwarfs has @xmath4 @xmath7 1.15 above the value given by the polynomial fit of @xcite and 1.01 above the one by @xcite .",
    "this is not reported as a young system @xcite , and therefore the overluminosity might be explained by multiplicity .",
    "in such case , we could be looking at a quadruple system of l dwarfs . only with further observations",
    "can we expect to truly explain this system .",
    "in the same way , the gj 564 system also appears to have one of the two l4 secondaries above the sequence , and again binarity could be the explanation for its position in the plot .",
    "using the all - sky surveys 2mass and wise , we have identified two new systems with an l dwarf and a ms star as the primary components .",
    "such benchmark systems allow us to better understand how the observed properties of ucds are dependent on their ages and metallicities , and the two new systems here presented will help populate the growing sample of brown dwarfs with well constrained properties .",
    "spectroscopy of the two primaries will be needed in the future to further estimate their ages and metallicities , thus fully characterizing the systems .",
    "we have also investigated the binary fraction for the specific type of binaries presented here , those in which the l dwarf has a fgk or m star as a wide companion .",
    "the number of such systems known to date is , however , small and any conclusions are dependent on the completeness of the sample , in this case , up to distances of 19 pc .",
    "the use of deeper surveys such as ukidss and vista will allow us to probe further distances and expand the number of such systems .",
    "considering that 2mass is complete up to a _ j _",
    "@xmath27 16 , and taking into account the number of l dwarfs found , one can expect that by going three orders of magnitude fainter in the aforementioned surveys we can expect to increase the volume of sky sampled by up to 30 times .",
    "this means we can expect to find around 500 times more l dwarfs having a ms star as companion in an all sky sample .",
    "ultimately , it is by studying a large sample of ucds with abundances and age constraints from their companions that we can further understand and improve current atmoshperic models of these objects .",
    "finally we show that some of the l dwarfs present in systems with a ms star could be unresolved binaries , due to their relative overluminosity for their spectral type .",
    "one interesting case is the hd2057 system , in which two resolved l4 dwarfs might actually be unresolved binaries themselves , thus making this a possible quadruple l dwarf system with an f8 star as the primary .",

    "acd - j is also supported by a fondecyt postdoctorado fellowship under project no .",
    "dp , zz and hj have received support from ropacs during this research .",
    "this research has benefitted from the m , l , and t dwarf compendium housed at dwarfarchives.org and maintained by chris gelino , davy kirkpatrick , and adam burgasser .",

    "<S> we estimate its bolometric luminosity as log @xmath0 = @xmath13.78 @xmath2 0.045 and @xmath3 = 2080 @xmath2 260 k. the second system , gj499abc , is a triple , with an l5 dwarf as a companion to a binary with an m4 and k5 star . </S>",
    "<S> these two new systems bring the number of l dwarf plus main sequence star multiple systems to twenty four , which we discuss . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the binary fraction for l dwarfs and main sequence stars , and further assess possible unresolved multiplicity within the full companion sample . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis shows that some of the l dwarfs in this sample might actually be unresolved binaries themselves , since their @xmath4 appears to be brighter than the expected for their spectral types .    </S>",
