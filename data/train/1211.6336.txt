    "as mentioned in the introduction , the sc @xmath0 potentials constructed thereby were characterized by ignoring multi - nucleon absorption processes and by an imaginary part that goes rapidly to zero towards the @xmath29 threshold .",
    "there were no free parameters at this phase of the calculation and there was no coupling between the real and imaginary parts of the potential beyond that provided by the input @xmath1 amplitudes . in carrying out global fits to strong - interaction shifts and widths data across the periodic table",
