    "recently , long distance transmission of quantum state has been actively researched by many various groups . hence",
    ", when global network of quantum communication becomes realized , the efficient use of quantum network is essential .",
    "especially , a large scale network often has a bottleneck point that causes a transmission rate relatively small for the size of its communication resource .",
    "hence , it is required to resolve this bottleneck problem in order to realize the high communication rate . in the classical network system ,",
    "ahlswede et al.@xcite formulated this problem as network coding , and gave its solution as a coding in typical examples like the butterfly network ( fig [ gb ] ) .",
    "that is , they showed that the two informations can be sent crossly in the butterfly network ( fig [ gb ] ) , in which , all channels are allowed to transmit only one bit , then , the bottleneck is the channel @xmath0 .",
    "the butterfly network seems only a specific example of network coding , however , it represents the properties of networks with bottlenecks so that their solution gave a trigger for a more general solution . concerning quantum system , hayashi et al .",
    "@xcite initiated to study transmitting quantum state based on the quantum network as its quantum extension . in particular ,",
    "they focused on the butterfly network , and proved that perfect quantum state transmission is impossible in the butterfly network , i.e. , the bottleneck @xmath0 can not be resolved in the quantum setting . after this research , iwama et",
    "al.@xcite treated quantum network coding with various types of networks .    on the other hand",
    ", prior entanglement provides some miracle performances in quantum information . in dense coding@xcite ,",
    "prior entanglement enables the two - bit classical information only by one qubit transmission . in quantum teleportation",
    "@xcite , prior entanglement enables the transmission of quantum state only by the sending classical information .",
    "hence , it is an interesting problem to discuss whether prior entanglement enhances quantum network coding .        in order to resolve this bottleneck , leung et",
    "al.@xcite proposed a network code that transmits the quantum state crossly by use of shared entanglement between any two parties .",
    "that is , they pointed out that if all pairs of the sender and the receiver share prior entanglement , combination of quantum teleportation and dense coding enables perfect quantum state transmission in this network .",
    "if two - bit transmission is allowed instead of one qubit transmission , only using quantum teleportation , perfect trasmission of quantum state is available .",
    "however , their protocol requires preparing shared entanglement among four players .",
    "so , it is required to reduce the number of players sharing the prior entanglement because increase of this number yields increase of the communication cost in the preparation stage .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the butterfly network , with / without prior entanglement between only two senders . as our result",
    ", we find that prior entanglement between two senders enables perfect quantum transmission while it is impossible without prior entanglement even in the following modification of the rule of quantum network coding treated by hayashi et al .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we allow either one qubit transmission or two - bit classical communication in fig [ gb ] although hayashi et al .",
    "@xcite allow only one qubit transmission in all channels in fig [ gb ] .",
    "this is because one qubit transmission can be exchanged with two - bit classical communication under the prior entanglement .",
    "we prove that perfect quantum state transmission is impossible even in such a modification .",
    "this type of use of prior entanglement seems to suggest further application of prior entanglement .",
    "hence , future research of this direction can be expected .",
    "now , we give the classical protocol by ahlswede et al .",
    "@xcite for the butterfly network ( fig [ gb ] ) .",
    "the purpose is sending the one - bit classical information @xmath1 from the site @xmath2 to the site @xmath3 , and sending the other one - bit classical information @xmath4 from the site @xmath5 to the site @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", all channels can send only one - bit information .",
    "the bottleneck is the channel @xmath0 between the sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the solution is given by fig [ gb2 ] .",
    "that is , the receiver @xmath9 recovers the information @xmath10 by taking the sum of two received bits .        however , the same protocol is impossible in the quantum case . in this paper , all channels @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath0 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 can transmit only one qubit or two - bit classical information .",
    "the purpose is sending the one - qubit state @xmath17 from the site @xmath2 to the site @xmath3 , and sending the other one - qubit state @xmath18 from the site @xmath5 to the site @xmath6 .",
    "the main result is the protocol transmitting these two quantum states crossly with two prior bell states between the senders @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "further , we prove its impossibility without prior entanglement .",
    "that is , the average @xmath19 is less than 0.9504 , where @xmath20 is the average fidelity between the sent state on @xmath21 and the recovered state on @xmath9 with the uniform distribution concerning @xmath22 . in our proof",
    ", we only use the constraint that the size of the channel @xmath0 is either one qubit or two classical bits .",
    "other constraints are not essential for our proof of impossibility part .",
    "note that hayashi et al .",
    "@xcite obtained the upper bound @xmath23 of fidelity .",
    "however , they concern the worst case instead of the average case .",
    "finally , we should comment the relation between the main idea and the preceding researches .",
    "leung et al .",
    "@xcite gave the relationship between the secret sharing @xcite and the capacity region of quantum network coding with the butterfly network .",
    "our proof of impossible part is motivated by this method .",
    "however , our proof does not use any result concerning secret sharing . only the relation @xmath24 in @xcite is used , where @xmath25 is the mutual information @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the von neumann entropy of the system @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , they conjectured that prior entanglement between neighboring parties can not enhance the ability of quantum network code in the butterfly network . as is mentioned in discussions",
    ", we can show this conjecture as a byproduct .",
    "this is a great advantage of our method .",
    "this paper uses several relations in quantum information , in which the corresponding relation in the book @xcite is referred .",
    "further , while their approach can treat only the asymptotic case where the fidelity goes to @xmath29 , our approach can treat the finite fidelity .",
    "now , we give our protocol , which enables transmitting quantum state perfectly and crossly based on the butterfly network , whose protocol is summarized by fig [ gb3 ] . in our protocol",
    ", we essentially use quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "assume that the two senders @xmath2 and @xmath5 share two pairs of the maximally entangled state @xmath30 , where the first pair has two sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the second pair has other two sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the two senders @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath5 prepare their states @xmath35 and @xmath36 .        in the first step ,",
    "the sender @xmath21 performs the bell measurement @xmath37 on the joint system @xmath38 , and obtains his data @xmath10 , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 correspond to @xmath43 , respectively . in this case",
    "the state on the remaining site @xmath44 is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the recovering unitary operation for teleportation with the outcome @xmath47 .    in the second step",
    ", the sender @xmath21 performs the unitary operation @xmath48 to the remaining site @xmath44 , hence , the state on the system @xmath44 becomes @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "then , the sender @xmath21 sends the system @xmath44 to @xmath51 via the channel @xmath52 .",
    "he also sends the classical information @xmath10 via the channel @xmath53 . in the third step",
    ", the site @xmath7 sends the classical information @xmath54 via the channel @xmath0 .",
    "also , the site @xmath8 sends the same classical information @xmath54 to @xmath3 and @xmath6 via the channels @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in the final step",
    ", the receiver @xmath9 performs the unitary operation @xmath55 to the received state @xmath56 .",
    "then , he recovers the original state @xmath57 .",
    "this protocol can be extended to the qudit case .",
    "one may think that the phase factor causes dephasing when the state to be sent is entangled .",
    "assume that @xmath58 is the initial state among @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and their reference system @xmath59 .",
    "when the data @xmath1 and @xmath4 are obtained , the final state is @xmath60 .",
    "then , the state can be recovered perfectly .",
    "for our proof of impossibility without prior entanglement , we focus on the following six properties in quantum information system : the number ( * . * ) represents the number of equation in @xcite .",
    "_ [ p1 ] monotonicity of quantum mutual information ( 8.38 ) @xmath61 : _ @xmath62    _ [ p2 ] sum of quantum mutual information : _ as was shown by imai et al.@xcite , the inequality @xmath63 holds .",

    "_ [ p5 ] quantum fano inequality ( 8.51 ) : _ the entanglement fidelity @xmath73 concerning the channel @xmath66 from @xmath28 to @xmath67 , is given by @xmath74 where @xmath59 is the reference system , and @xmath75 .",
    "_ [ p6 ] twirling of channel : _ for any channel @xmath66 , its twirling @xmath76 is defined by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the invariant distribution on @xmath79 . from the convexity ,",
    "the quantum transmission information of the original channel @xmath66 is greater than that of its twirling @xmath76 .",
    "further , the entanglement fidelity of @xmath66 is equal to that of @xmath76 .",
    "in this section , we prove that the perfect quantum state transmission is impossible in the butterfly network without prior entanglement . for this purpose , we will prove the entanglement fidelity @xmath80 concerning the channel @xmath81 from @xmath21 to @xmath9 satisfies the following inequality : @xmath82 solving this inequality yields @xmath83 . since the average @xmath20 of the fidelity @xmath84 is equal to @xmath85@xcite , we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "now , we prove the inequality ( [ 4 - 16 - 1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath87 be the reference system of @xmath21 .",
    "we focus on the channel with the input @xmath2 and the output @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath89 , p2 implies that @xmath90 similarly , @xmath91    as there is no prior entanglement , the system @xmath92 is independent of the system @xmath93 .",
    "hence , @xmath94 thus , @xmath95    when @xmath0 is a one - qubit quantum channel , the relation @xmath96 holds .",
    "now , let @xmath97 be the auxiliary system of @xmath98 , then , @xmath99 .",
    "hence , @xmath100    when @xmath0 is a two - bit classical channel , the relation @xmath101 holds .",
    "thus , @xmath102    combining the above relations with p3 and p1 , we obtain @xmath103 where the second inequality follows from ( [ 4 - 16 - 4 ] )  ( [ 4 - 16 - 6 ] ) , and the final inequality follows from ( [ 4 - 16 - 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 - 16 - 3 ] ) .",
    "now , we focus on the twirling of @xmath81 by @xmath104 , and denote the transmission informations in the case of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 by @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , respectively . in the case of the twirling channel , the entropy of system @xmath47 is described by @xmath111 . note that the entanglement fidelity of @xmath81 is equal to that of @xmath104 .",
    "using p6 , we have @xmath112 thus , @xmath113 p6 and p5 imply @xmath114 therefore , @xmath115 using the convexity of @xmath116 , we obtain ( [ 4 - 16 - 1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , our discussion on impossible part can be applied to the asymptotic case .",
    "we assume that @xmath117 times use of the butterfly network , @xmath118 qubit is sent from @xmath21 to @xmath9 perfectly . as a generalization of ( [ 4 - 16 - 7 ] ) , the relation @xmath119 holds . since @xmath120 , and @xmath121",
    ", we obtain @xmath122 which has been obtained by leung et al.@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we focused on quantum network coding in the butterfly network , and considered the effect of the existence of the prior entanglement between the senders @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
