    "biological populations are often exposed to catastrophic events that cause mass extinction : epidemics , natural disasters , etc .",
    "when mild versions of these disasters occur , survivors may develop strategies to improve the odds of their species survival .",
    "some populations adopt dispersion as a strategy .",
    "individuals of these populations disperse , trying to make new colonies that may succeed settling down depending on the new environment they encounter .",
    "recently , schinazi  @xcite and machado _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed stochastic models for this kind of population dynamics .",
    "for these models they concluded that dispersion is a good survival strategy .",
    "earlier , lanchier  @xcite considered the basic contact process on the lattice modified so that large sets of individuals are simultaneously removed , which also models catastrophes . in this work",
    "there are qualitative results about the effect of the shape of those sets on the survival of the process , with interesting non - monotonic results , and dispersion is proved to be a better strategy in some contexts .    moreover , brockwell _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and later artalejo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a model for the growth of a population ( a single colony ) subject to collapse . in their model , two types of effects when a disaster strikes were analyzed separately , _ binomial effect _ and _ geometric effect_. after the collapse , the survivors remain together in the same colony ( there is no dispersion ) .",
    "they carried out an extensive analysis including first extinction time , number of individuals removed , survival time of a tagged individual , and maximum population size reached between two consecutive extinctions .",
    "for a nice literature overview and motivation see kapodistria _ et al . _",

    "@xcite , we analyze growth models of populations subject to disasters , where after the collapse species adopt dispersion as a survival strategy .",
    "we show that dispersion is not always a good strategy to avoid the population extinction .",
    "it strongly depends on the effect of a catastrophic event , the spatial constraints of the environment and the probability that each exposed individual survives when a disaster strikes .",
    "this paper is divided into four sections . in section 2",
    "we define and characterize three models for the growth of populations subject to collapses . in section 3",
    "we compare the three models introduced in section 2 and determine under what conditions the dispersion is a good strategy for survival , due to space restrictions and the effects when a disaster strikes .",
    "finally , in section 4 we prove the results from sections 2 and 3 .",
    "first we describe a model presented in artalejo _",
    "et al . _",
    "this is a model for a population which sticks together in one colony , without dispersion .",
    "the colony gives birth to a new individual at rate @xmath0 , while collapses happen at rate @xmath1 .",
    "if at a collapse time the size of the population is @xmath2 , it is reduced to @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 are determinated by how the collapse affects the population size .",
    "next we describe two types of effects .",
    "@xmath5 _ binomial effect : _ disasters reach the individuals simultaneously and independently of everything else .",
    "each individual survives with probability @xmath6 ( dies with probability @xmath7 ) , meaning that @xmath8    @xmath5 _ geometric effect : _ disasters reach the individuals sequentially and the effects of a disaster stop as soon as the first individual survives , if there are any survivor .",
    "the probability of next individual to survive given that everyone fails up to that point is @xmath9 which means that @xmath10    the binomial effect is appropriate when the catastrophe affects the individuals in a independent and even way . the geometric effect would correspond to cases where the decline in the population is halted as soon as any individual survives the catastrophic event .",
    "this may be appropriate for some forms of catastrophic epidemics or when the catastrophe has a sequential propagation effect like in the predator - prey models - the predator kills prey until it becomes satisfied .",

    "@xcite the authors consider the binomial and the geometric effect separately as alternatives to the total catastrophe rule which instantaneously removes the whole population whenever a catastrophic event occurs .    here",
    "we consider a mixture of both effects , that is , with probability @xmath11 the group is striken sequentially ( geometric effect ) and with probability @xmath12 the group is striken simultaneously ( binomial effect ) .",
