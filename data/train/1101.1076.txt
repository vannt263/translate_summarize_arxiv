    "recent studies@xcite based on x - ray absorption and emission spectroscopy , however , suggest that the majority of water molecules in the liquid donate only one , strong hydrogen bond . since the well - studied simulation models of water ( fig .",
    "[ fg : intro ] ) describe reasonably well @xcite the phase behavior of the fluid at normal temperature and pressure , this suggestion naturally raises the question of how the coordination states of water are related to the excess chemical potential , a basic descriptor of the phase behavior .",
    "however , even for the well studied simulation models , the contribution of the coordination states to the free energy is not known . in this article",
    ", we present the theoretical framework to address this issue and apply it to the spc / e @xcite water model .    the theoretical framework anchoring the present study derives from a quasi - chemical organization of the potential distribution theorem @xcite . within this approach a coordination region",
    "is defined around the solute to sort local solvent configurations from bulk arrangements of the liquid .",
    "implicit in this sorting is the separation of the strong and specific local interactions from the non - specific solute - bulk interactions @xcite .",
    "the excess chemical potential of the solute is thus given by the sum of : ( 1 ) a local packing contribution accounting for the work of creating a cavity in the liquid , ( 2 ) chemical contribution accounting for the specific local interactions within the coordination region , and ( 3 ) contributions from the long - range interactions .",
    "the local contribution can be expressed as a sum over coordination states @xcite , where a coordination state is labelled by the number @xmath2 of solvent molecules in the coordination region .",
    "this allows one to examine the effect of progressively adding solvent molecules to the solute s coordination region while monitoring its excess chemical potential . using this molecular _ aufbau _ approach @xcite , earlier we studied the hydration of some monovalent ions . for chemically reasonable coordination radii",
    ", the molecular _ aufbau _ approach showed that the local chemical contribution is almost entirely obtained by coordination states below the most probable coordination state .",
    "further , only a subset of those states make a dominant contribution to the thermodynamics of hydration . for example , the most probable coordination number of k@xmath4(aq ) is @xmath5 , but almost all of the local chemical contribution is obtained by the @xmath6 coordination state .",
    "the most probable coordination state of a distinguished water molecule is @xmath6 for spc / e water ( fig .",
    "[ fg : intro ] ) .",
    "the earlier study then suggests that @xmath7 states are important in accounting for specific interactions , but the contribution of each individual state remains to be determined .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in the following section we summarize the statistical thermodynamic theory . since coordination states with small @xmath2 , especially the state @xmath8 ,",
    "may not be accessible via thermal fluctuations alone , we develop an ensemble reweighing technique to uncover these low - coordination states .",
    "we study coordination radii up to 5.5   . for a coordination radius of @xmath9   ,",
    "slightly greater than the first minimum of the oxygen - oxygen pair correlation function , the long range contribution is well - described by a gaussian model of hydration@xcite : that is , the outer - shell contribution is given by non - specific interactions .",
    "for this radius , the local chemical contribution is entirely accounted for by the @xmath6 coordinate state , but the @xmath3 state makes a contribution that is twice as large as the @xmath10 state .",
    "thus even for a fluid characterized as tetrahedral , we find that the four coordinating water molecules are different in their relevance to the thermodynamics .    for a coordination radius of 5.5   , none of the coordination sphere water molecules directly bond with the distinguished water molecule .",
    "they are instead pulled closer to the interface with the bulk . investigating this aspect reveals a central insight of this paper : the occupancy characteristics of a _ solute - free _ coordination sphere are an important factor in the observed coordination structure of a solute - water .",

    "models @xcite .",
    "second , by about 5.5   , the outer - shell contribution is small ( fig .",
    "[ fg : muouter ] ) , and the difference in packing and chemical contributions itself accounts for nearly all of the hydration free energy of water .      figure  [ fg : aufbau ] shows the building - up of the local , chemical contribution , @xmath77 , with successive addition of a solvent ligand . at @xmath78  ",
    " the coordination radius that fully accounts for the local , specific contribution and beyond which outer - shell interactions are non - specific ( fig .",
    "[ fg : muouter ] )  approximately all of the local chemical contribution is accounted for by the @xmath6 coordination state ( fig .",
    "[ fg : aufbau ] , left panel ) .",
    "thus four water molecules around the distinguished water molecule are necessary to fully capture the local chemistry .",
    "however , the four solvent ligands are not equivalent .",
    "the first added ligand , corresponding to the @xmath3 coordination state , contributes about twice ( thrice ) as much to @xmath77 as the second ( fourth ) ligand .",
    "the importance of the @xmath3 coordination state is clearly seen for @xmath22 up to 4.5   ( fig .",
    "[ fg : aufbau ] , right panel ) .        for coordination radii beyond @xmath79   , the distinction between the solvent ligands tends to decrease , and by @xmath68   , both the @xmath3 and the @xmath6 states contribute roughly equally to @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fg : aufbau ] , right panel ) .",
    "( in contrast , such a turn - around is not expected in the hydration of ions @xcite . )",
    "we next explore the reason for this behavior and discover the importance of ligand - bulk interactions in influencing the ligand s interaction with the distinguished solute .",
    "the maximum term approximation of eq .",
    "[ eq : aufbau ] @xmath80 shows that the intrinsic occupancy of the solute - free coordination sphere , the @xmath81 term , and solute - ligand interactions , the @xmath82 term , together determine the local chemical contribution . for coordination states",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 and hence the first term on the right will always contribute favorably to the chemical contribution .",
    "further , @xmath85 is comparable to , and in some instances more favorable than , @xmath82 itself ( fig .",
    "[ fg : aufbauwn ] ) : thus intrinsic occupancy variation , reflecting the bulk behavior of the fluid , is important in the hydration structure of a distinguished water molecule .",
    "figure  [ fg : aufbauwn ] ( left panel ) shows that @xmath82 decreases for @xmath86   .",
    "observe that the free energy of forming a 1-water cluster is comparable to the free energy for forming a 4-water cluster .",
    "this observation reiterates the importance of the @xmath3 coordination state in the thermodynamics of hydration ( fig .",
    "[ fg : aufbau ] ) .",
    "but for @xmath74   , @xmath82 increases indicating that it is progressively _ less favorable _ to form a cluster around the distinguished solute . to understand why @xmath82 increases for @xmath74   ,",
    "let us consider @xmath87 for various @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fg : aufbau ] , right panel ) .",
    "the curve for @xmath88 is relatively flat , and for @xmath89   it is at a value of approximately @xmath90  kcal / mol .",
    "this is a rather remarkable trend .",
    "the free energy is negative ( favorable ) indicating that the solvent ligand within the empty coordination sphere can satisfy the bonding of solvent molecules adjoining the coordination sphere .",
    "indeed the near constancy of the value suggests that the solvent ligand in the coordination sphere _ is _ near the interface with the outer - shell solvent .",
    "this fact is easily confirmed by calculating the pair - correlation of the solvent ligand and remaining water molecules ( data not shown ) .",
    "the magnitude of the free energy is consistent with that expected for hydrogen bonds@xcite and is nearly 20% of the hydration free energy of spc / e water .",
    "this observation complements one made recently by chempath and pratt@xcite that the bulk of the hydration free energy of water is accounted for _ before _ the water molecule fully enters the liquid from the vapor .",
    "even more remarkably , for @xmath89   , @xmath91 ; that is @xmath92 .",
    "thus for @xmath89   , the solvent ligands entering the solute - free coordination sphere are largely independent of each other and stay near the interface .",
    "the above discussion then provides an answer to why beyond @xmath89   the _ aufbau _ approach finds that the distinction between the contributions of the coordinating solvent ligands decreases ( fig .",
    "[ fg : aufbau ] , right panel ) .",
    "as the coordination sphere is enlarged , the solvent ligands prefer to partition to the interface .",
    "that is the solute water - solvent ligand interaction is not strong enough to compete with the bonding opportunities for the ligand with the outer - shell material .",
    "the number of solvent ligands within a coordination sphere around the solute , the coordination state of the solute , depends on two factors .",
    "one is the ligand occupancy of the coordination sphere in the _ absence _ of the solute and the second is the free energy of forming solute - ligand clusters within the coordination sphere . for the hydration of a water molecule solute ,",
    "these two factors are of comparable magnitude .    for a chemically meaningful coordination radius of 3.5   ,",
    "the free energy of forming a 1-water cluster around a solute water is nearly the same as that for forming a 4-water cluster , emphasizing the importance of the @xmath3 coordination state in the hydration thermodynamics of the solute water .",
    "yet the average coordination state of the solute water is @xmath6 .",
    "we can understand this behavior by noting that we incur an energetic penalty to create an empty coordination sphere in bulk water .",
    "solvent ligands that enter this empty volume partition towards the surface of the coordination sphere , thereby satisfying the bonding requirements of the water molecules outside the coordination sphere and also shrinking the coordination volume itself .",
    "this effect itself accounts for nearly 2 - 3 water molecules of the 4 water molecules comprising the average coordination structure of the _ solute _ water .",
    "it is precisely because the bonding between the solute and the solvent ligand is strong enough to only organize a 1-water cluster that the solvent ligands also bond with the outer - material , where more bonding opportunities are available .",
    "these results can be better appreciated by considering the hydration of strongly ionic solutes . there",
    "the local ion - solvent water interaction overwhelms the interaction of the solvent ligand with the outer - material .",
    "thus the occupancy distribution of the empty coordination sphere plays but a minor role in the observed coordination structure @xcite .",
    "for example , for a coordination radius of @xmath9   , the free energy for forming a one - water cluster around na@xmath4 is nearly 10 times the contribution from the intrinsic occupancy variation , @xmath93 . for water , in contrast",
    ", @xmath94 is nearly the same as @xmath93 .",
    "thus the hydration of a solute water molecule results from an interplay of two small , energetically equivalent contributions : one being the direct interaction of the distinguished water molecule with the proximal solvent ligand , and the second being the interaction of the proximal solvent ligand with the bulk .",
    "our results suggest that we can not claim that the average coordination structure is _ not _ four because the free energy of forming a 1-water cluster is comparable to that for forming a 4-water cluster around a solute .",
    "that is , given that the bonding of one water to the solute is as strong as the bonding of four does not invalidate the prominence of four coordinate states in the bulk fluid .",
    "this is especially so when solute - ligand interaction is comparable to ligand - bulk interaction as happens for water modeled by spc / e",
    ".    the spectroscopy experiments ( on real water)@xcite appear to probe the local bonding of water .",
    "our results on spc / e could possibly prove helpful in better appreciating those results .",

    "<S> the outer - shell term accounts for the interaction of the solute with the fluid outside the coordination sphere and it is accurately described by a gaussian model of hydration for coordination radii greater than the minimum of the oxygen - oxygen pair correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the conventional radial cut - off used for defining hydrogen - bonds in liquid water , theory helps identify a chemically meaningful coordination radius . </S>",
    "<S> the local chemical contribution is recast as a sum over coordination states . the @xmath1 term in this sum </S>",
    "<S> is given by the probability of observing @xmath2 water molecules inside the coordination sphere in the absence of the solute water times a factor accounting for the interaction of the solute with the inner - shell solvent water molecules . </S>",
    "<S> using this molecular _ aufbau _ expansion , we monitor the change in the chemical contribution due to the incremental increase in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that though four water molecules are needed to fully account for the chemical term , the first added water , the @xmath3 coordination state , accounts for nearly half the chemical term . </S>",
    "<S> our results emphasize the need to acknowledge the intrinsic occupancy of a solute - free coordination sphere together with solute - solvent interactions in rationalizing the tetrahedral coordination of the solute water . </S>"
