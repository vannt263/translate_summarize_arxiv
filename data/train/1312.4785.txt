    "because of the large velocity coverage per 2ghz receiver band , the continuum subtraction could initially be done reliably using all channels , without affecting a potential weak co signal . for those cases where co(1 - 0 ) was detected , the continuum subtraction was repeated by excluding the channels in which the faint co(1 - 0 ) signal was present .",
