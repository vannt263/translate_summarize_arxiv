    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies contain extraordinary nuclear starbursts and , at least in some cases , an active galactic nucleus , all hidden within a dense shroud of gas and dust .",
    "understanding the mechanisms which produce and power these luminous galaxies has taken on added urgency with the discovery of their young counterparts at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the nearest and prototype ultraluminous infrared galaxy , arp  220 , is located at a distance of 73 mpc ( @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 ) and is one of the best studied of this class of galaxies .",
    "the presence of tidal tails observed in the optical @xcite as well as two compact emission peaks at near - infrared @xcite , millimeter ( scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 , hereafter @xcite ; downes & solomon 1998 , hereafter @xcite ; sakamoto et al . 1999 , hereafter @xcite ) , and radio wavelengths @xcite suggests that arp  220 is a recent merger .",
    "given the observed correlation between high infrared luminosity and disturbed optical morphologies indicative of galaxy interactions @xcite , this merger is likely responsible for the extremely high infrared luminosity of arp  220 [ @xmath3  l@xmath4 , @xcite ] .",
    "there has been much debate as to whether the high infrared luminosity is due to a starburst or an active nucleus or a combination of the two , both for arp  220 in particular and for ultraluminous infrared galaxies in general @xcite .",
    "recent radio studies of arp  220 provide support for the starburst hypothesis : the 18 cm flux seen in vlbi observations is thought to be emitted by luminous radio supernovae @xcite and the effects of these supernovae winds are seen in x - rays @xcite .",
    "near - infrared @xcite and earlier radio observations @xcite further support the starburst scenario .",
    "besides its extremely high infrared luminosity , arp  220 also contains large amounts of dust and molecular gas ( @xmath5 @xcite ) ; large gas masses of @xmath6 are typical for ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "the extinction at optical wavelengths is estimated to be at least @xmath7 and possibly as high as @xmath8 @xcite ; even at near - infrared wavelengths ( 2.2@xmath9 m ) , dust lanes obscure the possible nuclei @xcite these high extinctions mean that radio observations are needed to probe the deep interior regions . @xcite have mapped arp  220 in co j=2 - 1 and 1.3 mm continuum ; besides detecting two emission peaks , they also see an extended disk ( with full - width half - maximum extent of @xmath10 ) .",
    "they interpret the emission peaks as the nuclei of the merging galaxies embedded in a more extended disk of molecular gas .",
    "@xcite refine the model further using their co j=2 - 1 and continuum observations ; in this model , the nuclei are each embedded in their own gas disk which is counter - rotating in the larger common disk .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the emission peaks as being due to crowding in the orbits of molecular gas and stars is given by @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the very first interferometric submillimeter observations of arp  220 in the co j=3 - 2 line and 0.88  mm continuum .",
    "in fact , it is the first paper to present data from submillimeter interferometry of any extragalactic source .",
    "we also present single dish observations of arp  220 of hcn j=4 - 3 , a high density tracer .",
    "furthermore , to determine the total co flux of arp  220 , which could be partly resolved out by the interferometer , complementary single dish data were taken in co j=3 - 2 as well as in the co j=2 - 1 line .",
    "these submillimeter observations allow us to penetrate deep into the interior of the nuclei , while at the same time tracing hotter gas , which may be more closely associated with the source of the ultraluminous infrared luminosity .",
    "we describe the observations in   [ sec : observations ] and the data analysis in   [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "the interferometric data were obtained with the single baseline cso - jcmt interferometer , the only currently available submillimeter interferometer with sufficient bandwidth to observe the broad emission lines of arp  220 . with data from a single baseline ,",
    "mapping is not possible and so we analyze the data by making fits in the visibility plane .",
    "the data are compared to published data at lower frequencies and to single dish data in   [ sec : discussion ] and the conclusions are presented in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the interferometric measurements were obtained with the cso - jcmt interferometer on mauna kea , hawaii , consisting of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) . usually these two telescopes are operated independently for single dish observations , but occasionally they are linked together as a submillimeter interferometer with a single baseline of 164  m and a minimum fringe spacing of 1.1@xmath11 at 350  ghz @xcite .",
    "the cso - jcmt interferometer is currently the only submillimeter interferometer with a bandwidth broad enough to accommodate the @xmath12  km  s@xmath2 wide line of arp  220 .",
    "the @xmath13co j=3 - 2 transition and associated continuum emission at 342.5  ghz of arp  220 were observed on 1997 may 10 in good weather with 1.4 mm of precipitable water vapor .",
    "the coordinates of arp  220 used were @xmath14(2000)=15@xmath15 34@xmath16 57.@xmath1719 , @xmath18(2000)=23@xmath19 30@xmath20 11@xmath213 ( originally @xmath14(1950)=15@xmath15 32@xmath16 46.@xmath1791 , @xmath18(1950)=23@xmath19 40@xmath20 07@xmath219 ) . to monitor the gain of the system ,",
    "these observations were interleaved with those of the quasar 3c  345 . continuum and line observations of arp  220 and 3c  345 were alternated in time .",
    "we also observed the quasar 3c  273 in both single dish and interferometric mode to determine the absolute flux calibration ; the interferometric observations were additionally used to determine the shape of the passband .",
    "figure  [ fig : uv ] shows the ( u , v ) track of the co j=3 - 2 data with a fringe spacing ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .    both the arp  220 and the 3c  345 data were divided by a passband created from observations of 3c  273 .",
    "changes in the relative gain of the interferometer as a function of time were then calibrated by applying the gain curve derived from observations of the point source 3c  345 to the arp  220 data .",
    "each set of ten 10-second integrations was vector - averaged to produce a series of 100-second integrations with higher signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the spectra displayed in figure  [ fig : spectra ] were further averaged to 1000 seconds .",
    "( the sixth spectrum only contains 500  seconds of data . )",
    "since the average phase might drift over time scales longer than 100  seconds due to instrumental or atmospheric phase shifts , the average phase over the whole frequency range of each 100-second sample was measured and then subtracted from the phases in each of the individual velocity channels .",
    "the resultant line data were then averaged by deriving the arithmetic means of the sine and cosine components in each individual channel .    by comparing single dish measurements of mars with those of 3c  273",
    ", we obtained a flux of @xmath24  jy for 3c  273 , which agrees very well with the value of 12.2  jy measured at 850  @xmath9 m with scuba around the same time @xcite .",
    "we used the 3c  345 measurements immediately before and after the 3c  273 data and obtained a 3c  345 flux of 0.90  jy averaged over the emission at 342.5 and 339.5  ghz . after averaging and",
    "gain calibrating the arp  220 and 3c  345 data in exactly the same way , the scalar average of the 3c  345 data was determined and from it the conversion factor from k to jy .",
    "this conversion may vary between the continuum and co data and with velocity bin because the gain calibration can vary with frequency range .",
    "we derived conversion factors ranging from @xmath25  jy  k@xmath2 to @xmath26  jy  k@xmath2 . the overall uncertainty in the calibration due to gain variations and uncertainties in the planet flux is estimated to be 20% @xcite .",
    "since the continuum data were measured at different ( u , v ) positions than the line data , we extrapolated the continuum data using the binary model discussed in  [ sec : fitres ] and subtracted 0.16 , 0.31 , 0.28 , 0.15 , 0.2 and 0.45  jy from the six co measurements ( with increasing hour angle ) , respectively .",
    "all velocities quoted use the radio definition ( @xmath27 ) with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .      on 1997",
    "july 17 and 18 we used the jcmt to observe emission lines from @xmath13co j=3 - 2 , @xmath13co j=2 - 1 , and hcn j=4 - 3 under good weather conditions .",
    "the observations were made with the facility 230  ghz ( a2 ) and 350  ghz ( b3 ) receivers , which had system temperatures of 270 - 360  k and 400 - 600  k , respectively , in the center of the spectral window .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a chopping secondary mirror using a switch cycle of 1  hz and a beam throw of 60@xmath11 in azimuth .",
    "we configured the das to give a spectral resolution of 1.25 mhz with a bandwidth of 1.86 ghz for b3 and 0.95 ghz for a2 .",
    "the relative errors in pointing were small , @xmath28  rms for a2 and @xmath29  rms for b3 , with significant systematic errors in the pointing apparent when observing at elevations greater than 80@xmath30 .",
    "spectra obtained at such high elevations were not used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "our data were flux calibrated through observations of mars and uranus .",
    "we found significant differences between our derived aperture efficiencies and the typical aperture efficiencies for the jcmt .",
    "we derive aperture efficiencies of 0.48 at 230 ghz , 0.42 at 265 ghz , and 0.43 at 345 ghz , compared to the standard telescope values of 0.69 at 230 ghz and 0.58 at 345 ghz .",
    "we adopt 20% as the error in the absolute calibration of our single dish observations .",
    "we present all our single dish data on the t@xmath31 temperature scale , which is most appropriate for the compact nuclear emission seen in arp  220 @xcite .",
    "we used the package specx @xcite to reduce the spectra and used first - order baselines in all cases .",
    "the co  j=2 - 1 spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "we derive an integrated intensity of 53  k  km  s@xmath2 , which for a conversion factor of 32.6  jy  k@xmath2(t@xmath32 ) corresponds to a flux of 1730  jy  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the flux determined by @xcite in a 12@xmath11 beam ( 1040  jy  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the interferometric maps of @xcite and @xcite show very compact co j=2 - 1 emission with a total extent of roughly @xmath33 .",
    "the larger flux detected in the 21@xmath11 beam of the jcmt suggests that there may also be extended co j=2 - 1 emission with roughly half the total intensity seen in the nuclear region .",
    "however , we also obtained co j=2 - 1 spectra at positions offset 11@xmath11 ( half a beam width ) from the central position ; the flux in those offset spectra is roughly half that in the center , consistent with quite compact emission in the central region .",
    "a small map of the co j=3 - 2 emission is shown in figure  [ fig : co32 ] .",
    "for the central position we derive an integrated intensity of 84  k  km  s@xmath2 , which for a conversion factor of 35.5  jy  k@xmath2 ( t@xmath32 ) corresponds to a flux of 2980  jy  km  s@xmath2 . when we convolve this map to simulate the 21@xmath11 beam of the co j=2 - 1 spectrum , we derive an integrated intensity of 45  k  km  s@xmath2 or 3700 jy  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this integrated intensity is somewhat larger than the value of 32  k  km  s@xmath2 obtained in a similar beam by @xcite , but agrees well with the measurement of @xcite .",
    "combining the convolved spectrum with the co j=2 - 1 data gives a co j=3 - 2/j=2 - 1 ratio of @xmath34 , where the uncertainty includes the estimated 20% calibration uncertainty in each line .",
    "the hcn spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : hcn ] , with an integrated intensity of 7.1  k  km  s@xmath2 ( 260  jy  km  s@xmath2 ) for the hcn j=4 - 3 transition .",
    "we can combine the hcn and co data obtained with similar beams to obtain an hcn j=4 - 3/co j=3 - 2 line ratio of @xmath35 .",
    "this line ratio is quite similar to the value of 0.12 obtained by @xcite for the j=1 - 0 transitions in 23 - 28@xmath11 beams .",
    "the cso - jcmt interferometer was used to measure the cross - correlated amplitude and phase of arp  220 as a function of observing frequency and as a function of ( u , v ) position ( figure  [ fig : uv ] ) , which is related to the projected baseline . with a fixed single baseline interferometer",
    ", we can not obtain sufficient coverage of the ( u , v)plane to produce an image of the source on the sky .",
    "nevertheless , the ( u , v ) data themselves contain a lot of information , which can be extracted by comparing simple models to the data ( such as a single extended disk , two point sources , etc . ) .",
    "we analyzed the amplitude and phase data separately following the guidelines in @xcite .",
    "the method of fitting models to the visibility _ phases _ is explained in ",
    "[ sec : theophase ] , that of fitting models to the visibility _ amplitudes _ in   [ sec : theovis ] and the best model fits to our continuum and co j=3 - 2 spectral line data are presented in   [ sec : fitres ] .",
    "readers who are interested primarily in the results of our analysis may wish to skip directly to   [ sec : fitres ] .",
    "the interferometer measures the difference in path lengths from the source to the two antennas in terms of phase .",
    "when corrected for geometric and instrumental effects , this phase contains information about the source s position in the sky .",
    "unfortunately , the cso - jcmt interferometer is not stable enough to determine accurately an absolute position of a source from its phase .",
    "however , with our spectral line data , it is possible to use the redshifted emission of arp  220 as a phase reference and to measure the phase of the blueshifted emission relative to the redshifted emission .",
    "fitting models to this phase difference as a function of ( u , v ) position can determine the position offset on the sky of the blueshifted emission relative to the redshifted emission . as an example , for a pure east - west baseline , a position offset in right ascension ( ra ) will result in a phase change proportional to the cosine of the hour angle of arp  220 , whereas an offset in declination introduces a phase change proportional to @xmath36 , where @xmath18 is the declination of arp  220 .",
    "more accurately , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the ( u , v ) coordinates of the phase reference source , which depends on all three components of the baseline as well as the declination and hour angle of the phase reference source @xcite .",
    "the visibility amplitude changes as a function of time depending on the structure of the source and the length and direction of the projected baseline .",
    "the visibility of a point source , i.e. a quasar , will be constant after correction for instrumental and atmospheric effects .",
    "therefore the visibilities of a point source , here 3c  345 , are used to calibrate out any instrumental or atmospheric changes .",
    "an extended source might be partially resolved out around transit , when the projected baseline is the largest , in which case its visibility amplitude would decrease .",
    "the visibility amplitude of two point sources will be a minimum whenever their separation is a multiple of half the fringe spacing . from these very simple consideration ,",
    "it is already clear from figure  [ fig : fit ] that our data are neither consistent with the visibility expected from a single point source nor are the data in panels ( a ) , ( d ) and ( e ) consistent with that from a single extended source .",
    "therefore we attempted to fit the arp  220 data primarily with models consisting of two sources .",
    "each source is assumed to have a gaussian brightness distribution of an elliptical shape ; this approach results in a model with 10 parameters ( the separation of the two sources and the position angle of this separation ; the flux , minor axis , major axis , and position angle of each source ) .",
    "it is possible that models with even more sources would fit the data even better .",
    "however , with measurements of the visibility amplitude at only 6 or 7 different ( u , v ) positions , we do not have enough data to constrain models with many more free parameters .",
    "we used the maximum likelihood method to determine which source model fit the data best .",
    "we first calculated the expected visibility amplitude for each model .",
    "since the noise of the data is known , the probability of each data point given the model can be calculated . in the case of high signal to noise ,",
    "the probability is described by a gaussian distribution . however , in our case , the noise is comparable to the signal and therefore the rice distribution describes our data better @xcite .",
    "the product of the probability of each of the data points given the model gives the likelihood of the model .",
    "the model with the greatest product of probabilities is the most likely .    for the continuum data we then calculated the bayesian error of each of the ten parameters for the most likely model .",
    "first , the probabilities for each model were normalized by dividing them by the maximum probability .",
    "then the probabilities of all models with the parameter @xmath40 having a given value @xmath41 were summed .",
    "( this sum is the marginal probability of @xmath41 , which is independent of the other nine parameters . )",
    "this process was repeated for all the different values @xmath42 , @xmath43 etc . of @xmath40 .",
    "( if we had a continuous rather than a discrete set of values for @xmath40 , this process would be equivalent to integrating the probability @xmath44 of the ten dimensional parameter space over all parameters but @xmath40 to give the one dimensional marginal probability of @xmath40 , @xmath45 . ) usually , but not necessarily , the value @xmath46 with the highest marginal probability is also the value found for the most likely model .",
    "in a small region around @xmath46 , the probability distribution can be approximated by a gaussian .",
    "we defined the one sigma bayesian error of @xmath46 as the distance between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath47 is the location where the marginal probability drops to @xmath48 .",
    "( more precisely , @xmath47 should define the boundaries within which 68% of the marginal probability lies . in the case",
    "where the marginal probability can be approximated by a gaussian , @xmath49 will have the value @xmath50 .",
    "since in our case the marginal probability distribution of the continuum data appears gaussian , we used the latter method to determine the error . ) the error on each parameter gives an indication of how well the measured data determine each parameter in a given model , but the error contains no information about the validity of the model .",
    "for the line data the bayesian error could not be calculated , because the marginal probability is not gaussian , as there are large secondary maxima of the probability .",
    "we have therefore taken a different approach : after finding the most likely model , we",
    "_ fixed _ all parameters but one and defined the 1@xmath51 error as the distance where the probability falls to @xmath52 .",
    "the difference to the continuum method is that we do not integrate over all other parameters , i.e. we are assuming that all other parameters are accurately known .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it ignores most secondary maxima , as we are only taking a one - dimensional cut in the 11-dimensional probability surface .",
    "since we are not taking account of all other planes , the errors are much smaller and do not reflect the error due to the existence of secondary maxima .",
    "( it might help to picture a two - dimensional probability distribution as a landscape with mountains , where the two dimensional plane represents the two parameters and the height the probability .",
    "the case of the continuum data can be imagined as one very high mountain in a landscape of low hills ; the line data would correspond to a complicated mountain range with many nearly equally high mountains . )    from the maximum likelihood method , we can only determine which of the models we _ tried _ is the most likely .",
    "it is , however , possible that an entirely different model we have not considered fits the data much better . for this reason it is very helpful to have maps of the source at other wavelengths ( e.g. around 230  ghz ) , which show the morphology of the source .",
    "the 342.5 ghz continuum measurements of arp  220 were fit using both single and binary source models .",
    "a single source model did not fit the data well .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit]a shows the visibility data at 342.5  ghz and the best binary fit to the data .",
    "the parameters of the best binary fit are listed in table  [ tab : cont ] , which also gives a comparison to published results from continuum data at other wavelengths .",
    "note in particular that , while the continuum data can constrain the strength and separation of the two sources , the models can not tell us whether the eastern or the western source is the stronger one .",
    "this limitation is due to the lack of absolute phase information as discussed in   [ sec : theophase ] .",

    "when comparing the co j=3 - 2 emission to maps , it is best to use the visibilities directly rather than the results from the model fitting . thus , we extrapolated the visibilities from the co j=2 - 1 ovro data @xcite to the ( u , v ) positions observed in co j=3 - 2 with the cso - jcmt for a direct comparison , which is shown in figure  [ fig : ovro ] .",
    "the binary model parameters that fit the continuum data best are listed in table  [ tab : cont ] , which also gives a comparison to continuum data at other frequencies from the literature .",
    "the binary separation determined from the continuum data is slightly larger and the position angle slightly smaller compared to the two sources seen in the 1.3 mm continuum map of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our data , however , agree reasonably well with the position of the formaldehyde emission , whose peaks are separated by @xmath71 at @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde is associated with star bursting gas @xcite , which will also contain hot dust emitting at submillimeter wavelengths ; it is therefore not surprising that the submillimeter emission shows the same morphology as the formaldehyde emission .",
    "the two continuum sources are point - like and their size can not be resolved with the cso - jcmt interferometer . from the model fitting (  [ sec : theovis ] ) , the 3@xmath51 upper limit of @xmath73 is consistent with the source sizes seen by @xcite and @xcite as well as the 2.2 @xmath9 m emission , which traces dust - enshrouded young stars @xcite .",
    "we detect only about half of the single dish continuum flux [ extrapolated with @xmath74 from the 1.1  @xmath53  0.4  jy total flux , which was measured by @xcite at 375  ghz with the jcmt ] .",
    "this result is slightly surprising because interferometry maps do not show significant extended continuum emission at 230  ghz .",
    "most of the measured 400  mjy @xmath53 80  mjy continuum flux is expected to come from dust emission rather than synchrotron or free - free emission .",
    "the flux ratio of the two sources is about 1.7 , similar to the 230  ghz data from @xcite , which suggests that the continuum flux arises under similar physical conditions in both sources .",

    "since the hcn j=4 - 3/j=1 - 0 line ratio is not affected by abundance changes , it seems likely that the physical conditions are different between the two emission peaks and that the eastern source is either at a higher temperature and/or has a higher density .",
    "these conclusions are supported by the work of @xcite , who detected cn j=2 - 1 emission from the blueshifted part of the line , and hc@xmath114n emission in the redshifted part of the line .",
    "they suggest that cn emission is an indicator of a photon dominated region while the hc@xmath114n emission is an indicator of hot cores , and suggest that the two nuclei may be in different evolutionary states .",
