    "direct evidence of the existence of dark matter can be seen in the case of the `` bullet cluster '' ( cl0152 - 1357 , @xcite ) , where the infalling cluster gas displays a bow shock followed by a wedge shaped contact discontinuity generated by the infalling gas .",
    "it has been found that the center of the mass belonging to the infalling cluster is offset from its gas , providing direct evidence of the existence of a dark mass component ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations of binary galaxy cluster mergers show that the bullet cluster should have had an initially high impact velocity @xmath2  3000 @xmath1   @xcite .",
    "a series of estimates have been made to quantify the probability of finding a system with a large impact velocity implied by the bullet cluster using large scale cosmological n  body simulations @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that it is very unlikely that merging clusters have very high impact velocities in the context of @xmath0cdm .",
    "however , it was pointed out by @xcite that the statistic of high impact velocity mergers is on the steeply falling tail of the probability distribution , therefore their conclusion is sensitive to model uncertainties .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out large scale cosmological simulations to estimate the effect of the box size of the simulations on the high velocity tail of the probability distribution .",
    "thompson & nagamine found that the probability of finding one cluster merger with impact velocity @xmath2  3000 @xmath1  in a concordance @xmath0cdm  model is @xmath3 , i.e. , it is very unlikely ( the peak of the impact velocity probability distribution is at about 550 @xmath1 , see their figure 15 ) .",
    "they concluded that the bullet cluster is either incompatible with the concordance @xmath0cdm  model , or the initial conditions suggested by the non - cosmological binary merger simulations overestimate the relative impact velocity .    since the discovery of the bullet cluster several other merging clusters",
    "have been found with large offsets between dark matter and x  ray gas emission , as well as between peaks of x  ray emission and sz signal ( cl j0152 - 1347 : @xcite , macs j0744.8 + 3927  and cl j1226.9 + 3332 : @xcite , macs j0717.5 + 3745 : @xcite ) .",
    "the size of these offsets is determined by two opposing interactions : the attractive force of the massive dark matter halo on its own gas and the ram pressure exerted on the gas of the infalling cluster by the gas of the more massive interacting cluster . using self",
    " consistent n / body  hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxy clusters , @xcite demonstrated that , in general , a large impact velocity is necessary to explain 100 kpc scale offsets between the peaks of mass distribution , x  ray emission and sz signal .",
    "clearly , a confirmation that several cluster mergers have very large impact velocities would pose a serious problem for our concordance @xmath0cdm  model , so it is important to explore fully shortcomings of the predictions in this context .",
    "typically , binary galaxy cluster simulations are semi ",
    "adiabatic in the treatment of gas physics , in the sense that they contain only adiabatic processes plus shock heating , but they do not contain non - gravitational physics such as feedback mechanisms , cooling and heating , nor magnetic fields",
    ". however , these effects might be minor relative to the very energetic shocks galaxy mergers produce .",
    "it is also possible that the basic non - interacting particle premise for dark matter is not the best assumption .",
    "a possible alternative is a very light and very cold bosonic dark matter ( less than about 10@xmath4 ev and a current temperature of a fraction of 1 k ) so that the dark matter would then reside in a bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "it has been shown , that axions may form bose  einsten condensates , which make them a viable candidate for this type of dark matter @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations of the growth of structure in this state show interesting macroscopic interference modifying the dynamics of halo collisions @xcite with possibly interesting implications for the interpretation of colliding clusters .",
    "bose - einstein condensate in a cosmological context have been studied recently by several authors using the gross  pitaevskii equation ( @xcite , and references therein ) . on large scales , after photon decoupling , the bac dark matter behaves similarly to conventional dark matter , therefore structure formation occurs similarly to the concordance @xmath0cdm  ( assuming that structure formation via cdm and bacdm result similar initial conditions after photon decoupling , however , see @xcite ) .",

    "deep _ xmm - newton _  x - ray data of a1750 was analyzed in detail by @xcite , finding an x - ray brighter cluster at the center of the field of view , and a fainter cluster to the north , termed a1750c and a1750n respectively , separated by about @xmath6 kpc , in projection on the sky .",
    "the x  ray emission at the center of a1750c is elongated towards a1750n , and more circular farther from the center . the cd galaxy of a1750c is offset from the x - ray peak towards the east , which is also the direction the gas seems to be compressed ( as suggested by the x  ray morphology ) .",

    "virial radius scalings suggest that the two clusters are at a distance of about 2@xmath9r@xmath10 , i.e , their intracluster gas components are already significantly interacting .",
    "the temperature of about 5 kev of the interaction region is much higher than the temperature we would expect at about r@xmath10 from the center of these clusters , therefore it seems to confirm that these two main components are in the early process of merging . based on a rough idealized model",

    ", @xcite found no significant offset in a1750 between the position of the peaks of mass , x  ray emission peaks , and smoothed optical luminosity .",
    "they found no significant mass substructure in a1750 either , thus they concluded that most likely this cluster has no recent major merger , and hence favor a premerger configuration .",
    "in our x - ray analysis , we make use of two sets of observations of a1750 from the _ chandra _  data archive ( cda ) with obsids : 11878 and 11879 , and total exposure times of 19.77 ks and 20.05 ks respectively .",

    "this assures us that the background extraction regions are far enough from the peak emission ( @xmath14 11@xmath12 ) where the cluster emission is negligible .",
    "we also compared the resulting fitted temperature profiles of a1750 using local background spectra and the blank  sky spectra normalized in the 9.012.0 kev band , and found that they were consistent .    in order to study the temperature along the merging axis",

    "these lensing measurements are very important when using numerical simulations to interpret observations of merging galaxy clusters because they can be used to identify and constrain the main mass components of the system .",
    "in particular , the morphology of the reconstructed mass surface distribution tells us about how many components are in the system , and the projected positions of the components give us information about the phase of the collision ( i.e. , the time before or after first core passage ) .",

    "this is chosen to be roughly within the range allowed by the lensing analysis of @xcite , except that we did not consider masses larger than 5 @xmath41@xmath42  because their virial radii would be too large and therefore the temperature increase in the interaction region would be much greater than what observed ( no useful constraints on concentration parameters are available from lensing ) .",
    "we find that assuming total masses , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath41@xmath42   and concentration parameters of 8 and 10 for the the main and the infalling cluster , we can reproduce the projected temperature profiles of the central regions of both clusters in the undisturbed cluster regions , away from the gas interaction zone in between the clusters .    , but from our flash  simulations with different impact parameters of 0 , 150 , and 200 kpc ( dashed , continuous , and dash  dotted lines ; runs : r6v08p00 , r2v08p15 , and r7v08p20 ) .",

    ", the third column shows the angle , @xmath45 , we rotated the system out of the plane of the sky towards the observer ( along an axis which is perpendicular to the line connecting the two cluster centers ) in order to reproduce the observed projected distance between the two x  ray peaks .",
    "after each simulated collision is completed , we generate x  ray surface brightness and projected x  ray temperature images for a range of viewing angles .",
    "we align the two mass centers with the @xmath46 coordinate axis choosing the @xmath47 axis so that the @xmath48 plane coincides with the plane of the collision , which we first consider to be the plane of the sky .",
    "then , we rotate our cluster around the @xmath46 axis with a roll angle , @xmath49 , ( active rotation ) , then around the @xmath47 axis by a polar angle of @xmath45 . therefore , with this definition , zero rotation angles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) mean that the collision is in the plane of the sky . once we choose the roll angle and the polar angle , we generate the x  ray surface brightness image by performing a line  of  sight ( los ) integral @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the spatial coordinate in the los , and we used the publicly available _ apec _",

    "we focus on modeling the interaction region , which is between the two temperature peaks excluding the core regions around the clusters within a radius of about 0.2 kpc , which is , in our distance coordinate , from 0.15 to 0.8 mpc .",
    "we obtain acceptable fits in the interaction region to all impact velocities we considered , except the high impact velocity of 3500 @xmath1 , for which the simulated temperature profile deviates more than 2@xmath11 from all three data points in this region ( three points in the middle ) . based on this figure",
    ", we conclude that a large impact velocity for a1750 is very unlikely .",
    "we show the effect of different impact parameters in figure  [ f : tspec_pimp ] . it can be seen from this figure that varying the impact parameter over 0 , 150 , 200 kpc does not change the projected temperature significantly . clearly , the projected temperature is not sensitive to a moderate change in the impact parameter , therefore we can not put meaningful constraint on this parameter .",

    "1st and 2nd panels we show the images of the projected temperature and the corresponding error using adaptive binning of the image based on surface brightness contours following the method described by @xcite .",
    "the errors in the temperature in the interaction region are large , about 1 kev , due to the low surface brightness and the short exposure time .",
    "the surface brightness contours in this region are dominated by noise , therefore the temperature map is not reliable ( the projected temperature map in the interaction region based on the merged observations do not agree with those from on the individual observations ) .",
    "we can only conclude that there seem to be no large temperature peaks or troughs in this region .",
    "our surface brightness and projected temperature temperature maps are consistent with those of @xcite , who used a 34 ks _ xmm - newton _  observation of a1750 ( their figure  2 and 5 ) . the projected temperature map of a1750 from _ xmm - newton _  observations has an error of about 0.6 kev in the interaction region showing a temperature enhancement with no significant increase or decrease towards the middle of the region .    the images of the projected temperature from our flash  simulations with impact velocities of 500 , 800 , 1400 , 1600 , and 3500 @xmath1   ( runs r1v05p15 , r2v08p15 , r3v14p15 , r4v16p15 , and r5v35p15 ; left to right , 1st and 2nd row ) are shown in figure  [ f : tspec_sim ] .",

    "the two peaks on the lower right and upper left corner in each image mark the cluster centers .",
    "the enhanced projected temperature region in the middle is the interaction region . since we need larger rotation angles out of the plane of the sky for larger velocities in order to have more cooler gas in the los to lower the projected temperature to match with the observations , the different morphology is due to the different rotation angles",
    ". therefore , as we can see it from figure  [ f : tspec_sim ] , in general , the temperature distribution in the interaction region has a bump in the middle for low impact velocities and turns into a saddle shape for larger velocities as a function of the rotation angle , @xmath45 .    our simulations assuming an impact velocity of 1400 @xmath1   and 1600 @xmath1  ( runs r3v14p15 and r3v16p15 ) with a flat plateau of about 6 kev in the projected temperature in the interaction region ( 1st and 2nd panel in the 2nd row in figure  [ f : tspec_sim ] ) have the most similar morphology to those from our _ chandra_analysis ( 2nd row 1st panel in figure  [ f : xray_compare ] ) and from the _ xmm - newton _  observation of a1750 ( figure  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "there are some small deviations due to substructure we have not modeled in our simulations , but the interaction region looks very similar",
    ". in this region r3v14p15 and r3v16p15 show different morphology at the level of about 0.5 kev , but these systematic variations are not significant , they are in the same order as the errors from observations .",
    "therefore , unfortunately , we can not derive an accurate impact velocity for a1750 based on the available projected temperature maps , because neither the _ chandra _  nor the _ xmm - newton _  observations have sufficient exposure time to construct an accurate projected temperature map .",
    "however , in principle , the morphology of the projected temperature can be used to put strict constraints on the impact velocity for merging clusters .",
    "our results from simulations suggest that if we have observed projected temperature maps with errors less than 0.5 kev , we may be able to constrain the impact velocities of merging clusters to 200300 @xmath1(compare 1st to 2nd panels in the 1st as well as in the 2nd row in figure  [ f : tspec_sim ] ) .",
    "the mach number for our best fit model ( run r3v14p15 , see figure  [ f : xray_compare ] ) can be calculated from our simulations directly .",

    "note that the predictions for the impact velocity from our simulations are not affected by the less massive component to the south because we start our simulations at the time of impact , and from that point of time the gravitational field is dominated by the two components we are following .    summarizing our results",
    ": we found that our flash  simulations can reproduce the x - ray morphology , projected temperature distribution and galaxy redshift measurements of a1750 assuming that the relative impact velocity is v  = 1460@xmath72 @xmath1   and the rotation angle from the plane of the sky is @xmath45  = 28.@xmath658@xmath74.@xmath654 .",

    "our results suggest that we can eliminate the possibility of a large impact velocity greater than 2000 @xmath1  ( at 99.7% cl ) for this merging cluster since that would imply a much larger relative radial velocity than the observed .",
    "note that the quoted uncertainties refer to statistical errors due to observations based on our idealized cluster merging simulations .",
    "these errors do not reflect possible systematic errors due to asphericity , substructure ( visible in the _ xmm - newton _  image of the system ; see figure 2 of @xcite ) , gas falling in along the filament between the two components , and deviations due to the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium at the outer regions of clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; and references therein ) , and modeling uncertainties in the outer regions of clusters due to weak constraints from observations , which have not been quantified in this context .",
    "although the systematic effects might be larger than our statistical errors , we do not expect large changes ( say a factor of two ) in the derived impact velocity for a1750 from systematic effects because the intracluster gas of each component is compressed over a wide radial range , from @xmath93300 kpc to @xmath931000 kpc into a 200 kpc region from @xmath93300 kpc ( the inner limit of the interaction region ) to @xmath93500 kpc ( the position of the contact discontinuity , see figure  [ f : shock ] ) .",
    "therefore the resulting density and temperature profiles , for comparison with the data , should not be very sensitive to the initial conditions of the gas .",
    "we have been carrying out self  consistent n / body  hydro - dynamical simulations ( including dark matter and gas ) to investigate how we can best determine the impact velocities of merging galaxy clusters .",
    "we have demonstrated , that the impact velocities can be determined in an early stage of merging , in the case of a1750 , well before the first core passage with the use of multi  wavelength data and hydrodynamical simulations . the physical basis which enables us to derive the impact velocity of a merging system before",
    "the first core passage is that the temperature of the shocked gas depends on the relative velocities of the two subclusters .",
    "observations do not provide the physical temperature of the gas in clusters directly , but only the projected temperature , which can be substantially lower than the physical temperature due to the averaging along the line of sight in projection which could contain a substantial amount of cold gas .",
    "we have shown with our models that the observed ( projected ) temperature depends on the angle we rotate the system towards the observer around the axis perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the two subclusters . even without rotation ,",
    "the projected temperature is about 12 kev lower than the physical temperature .",
    "we demonstrated that this degeneracy can be resolved using the morphology of the merging system and independently using the observed galaxy redshift information , and thus a more accurate determination of the impact velocity is possible .",
    "as a consequence , we conclude that the conventional method deriving the impact velocities for merging systems is not reliable due to two erroneous assumptions : ( 1 ) the measured projected temperature is the physical temperature ; ( 2 ) the temperature of the interaction region is exclusively coming from the shock .    as a case study , we used multi ",
    "wavelength observations and numerical simulations to constrain the impact velocity in the merging galaxy cluster a1750 .",
    "results from previous weak lensing analysis were used here to constrain the masses of the two main components , and member galaxy redshifts constrained the projected los instantaneous relative velocities of the two merging clusters .",
    "we used x  ray measurements to constrain the impact velocity and rotation angle of the plane of the collision relative to the los .",
    "we found that among our idealized cluster merging simulations with the input masses constrained to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath41@xmath42 , the concentration parameters fixed at 8 and 10 , and impact parameter at 150 kpc , the simulation with a relative velocity of 1460 @xmath1  matches all available observations well .",
    "impact velocities in excess of 2000 @xmath1  are unlikely because , either the implied instantaneous relative velocities would exceed the observed los relative velocity of 900 @xmath1 , or the collision would have to lie very close to the plane of the sky , in which case a high velocity impact is excluded by the high projected x  ray temperature in the interacting region which is measured to be only about 6 kev by the x  ray observations .",
    "our constraints on the infall velocity are stronger from the radial velocity difference derived from optical observations because we do not have strong constraint from the gas morphology from the relatively short x  ray exposures .",
