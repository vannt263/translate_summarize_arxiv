    "since a significant population of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , i.e. the sources whose 81000  @xmath0 m luminosity exceeds @xmath4 ) was discovered during the iras all - sky survey ( houck et al .",
    "1985 ) , the origin of their huge infrared ( ir ) emission has been widely debated .",
    "extreme ir activity is known to be closely related to interacting or merging systems : optical and near - ir imaging shows that a large part of ulirgs is indeed resulting from the collision of gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. clements et al .",
    "1996 ; scoville et al . 2000 ) .",
    "multiwavelength observations have pointed out that the typical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ulirgs is characterized by a prominent far - ir peak due to dust reprocessing of higher - frequency primary radiation , whose elusive source is supposed to be a combination of merger - induced bursts of star formation and gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole . despite their low frequency and limited contribution to the energy density of the local universe ( soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) , nearby ulirgs represent the counterparts of both the submillimetre sources ( blain et al . 2002 , and references therein ) and the 24  @xmath0m  selected galaxies that are responsible for the dominant energy output at high redshift ( caputi et al . 2007 ) . understanding their nature and physical properties is therefore a task of great importance , with far - reaching implications for models of structure formation and galaxy evolution . in particular ,",
    "many efforts have been made in order to assess the contribution of the starburst ( sb ) and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) components to ulirgs : such an estimate would give deeper insight into the history of star formation over cosmic time and the origin of the x - ray and far - ir backgrounds .",
    "+ all the diagnostic studies concerning ulirgs have to come to terms with the great opacity of their nuclear regions , that precludes a straight identification of the hidden power source .",
    "nevertheless the mid - ir thermal emission is expected to suffer from little extinction , and at the same time to preserve some relic signatures of the underlying engine , making this wavelength range very attractive for solid ulirg diagnostics . with the coming of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) and its infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) , high - quality mid - ir spectra of several tens of local ulirgs have become available .",
    "we have therefore been able to perform a 58  @xmath0 m spectral analysis of a sample of 71 local ulirgs , separating the agn and sb components in the observed emission and providing a quantitative estimate of the agn / sb contribution to the bolometric luminosity of each sourcem emission : throughout this paper the terms _ bolometric luminosity _ and _ ir luminosity _ are consequently used with an equivalent meaning . ] .",
    "the preliminary results have been anticipated in a recent letter ( nardini et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter paper  i ) , mainly focused on the presentation of the decomposition method . in the present work",
    "we will discuss in detail our findings and investigate their implications .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in section  [ rd ] we briefly review the main studies , from radio to x - rays , that have contributed to clarify the multiwavelength picture of ulirgs .",
    "section  [ sd ] illustrates the physical motivations for 58  @xmath0 m diagnostics and describes how recent _ spitzer _ observations have prompted our agn / sb decomposition effort .",
    "the ulirg sample is presented in section  4 , while section  5 concerns observations and data reduction . in section  6",
    "we summarize the fitting model and all the analytical steps leading to the estimate of the agn / sb contribution to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the comparison between our results and those obtained at different wavelengths is provided in section  7 , and the main implications of our findings are discussed in section  8 .",
    "the conclusions are drawn up in section  9 , and all the fits are shown in the appendix along with further considerations on some notable objects .",
    "the detection of a faint or obscured agn and the estimate of its contribution to the bolometric luminosity of the hosting galaxy are the main open issues in the study of ulirgs .",
    "this task is complicated because of the dust reprocessing , that smooths the intrinsic differences between the primary agn and sb radiation fields .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the broadband intrinsic emission of both active galactic nuclei and starbursts is then essential in order to find some signatures of the buried energy source .",
    "+ in the optical ulirgs are classified on the basis of intensity ratios , involving emission lines with different excitation energy to test the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "however , dust extinction and reddening affect the use and reliability of such optical diagnostics in various ulirgs ; moreover the possibility of a differential extinction of the agn and sb components is difficult to take into account . qualitatively",
    ", compelling evidence of agn activity is found in a modest fraction of the 118 ulirgs included in the iras 1  jy sample ( kim & sanders 1998 ) , with a possible trend of increasing agn detection rate in sources of higher luminosity ( veilleux , kim & sanders 1999 ) . at @xmath5",
    "nearly a half of ir galaxies exhibit the typical features of seyfert galaxies , and the fraction of agn - like objects is even larger if one includes the sources classified as low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) .",
    "the connection between agn and liners is anyway controversial , because the ionization degree of the latter can be a possible consequence of the supernova - driven shocks and the violent galactic winds pervading a starburst as well ( taniguchi et al .",
    "1999 ; lutz , veilleux & genzel 1999 ) .",
    "this leaves unsolved the issue about the fraction of ulirgs actually hosting an agn .",
    "+ the dust opacity affecting the optical , ultraviolet ( uv ) and near - ir domains turns irrelevant at radio wavelengths , which in principle also benefit of a much higher angular resolution accessible through interferometry .",
    "unfortunately these advantages are reduced by the low radio emission of ulirgs . nevertheless ,",
    "although jet - like structures or extended lobes have never been found in ulirgs , many of them present compact radio cores whose power does not correlate with the h@xmath6 luminosity nor with other usual indicators of star formation ( nagar et al .",
    "better spatial resolution is required to confirm the agn nature of such sources and rule out any hypothesis of a compact cluster of stars .",
    "+ speculatively , the optimal spectral region to clear all the ambiguities and detect the agn component is the 210  kev band , where it is possible to look through the obscuring material and take advantage of the sharp difference between the hard x - ray features and luminosity of starbursts and agn . as a matter of fact",
    ", the circumnuclear mixture of gas and dust can be compton - thick , with equivalent column densities in excess of @xmath7  @xmath8 , and bury an agn even in this energy range .",
    "moreover ulirgs are faint emitters , since their typical hard x - ray flux is usually far less than @xmath210@xmath9 times their ir flux ( e.g. risaliti et al . 2000 ) .",
    "hence the current instrumentation allows the x - ray diagnostics for a handful of bright sources only : intense star formation activity is confirmed to be the dominant power supply for extreme ir luminosity , and even if convincing traces of elusive agn ( i.e. missed in the optical , maiolino et al .",
    "2003 ) are found , the conclusions are still tentative ( franceschini et al .",
    "2003 ; ptak et al .",
    "+ in the mid- and far - ir , the reprocessed radiation still provides some clues to the enigmatic energy source , that can be recognized e.g. in the circumnuclear dust composition , in the sed large - scale profile and/or in the appearance of coronal lines .",
    "an empirical indicator of star formation is usually considered to be the group of emission features centred at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3  @xmath0 m , and attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) : these features are prominent in dusty environments exposed to soft uv radiation but strongly suppressed in the presence of harder radiation fields , probably because of the alteration / destruction of their carriers ( voit 1992 ) . the concurrent use of pah strength and appropriate line ratios , e.g. [ o  iv]/[ne  ii ] and [ ne  v]/[ne  ii ] , results in an effective probe into the nature of ulirgs ( genzel et al .",
    "yet the diagnostic methods based exclusively on emission lines can not be easily applied to faint sources .",
    "this involves the necessity of introducing the continuum properties and mid - ir colours as alternative diagnostic tools , as suggested by laurent et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , with the replacement of the line ratio with the ratio between the warm and the hot dust continua .",
    "a critical shortcoming actually remains , consisting in the possible non - detection of a weak agn inside the ulirg : an unresolved agn component which is heavily absorbed or intrinsically feeble can vanish within the much more diffuse and intense starburst emission .",
    "in order to overcome the potential agn - dilution effect , it is necessary to select the wavelength range in which the imbalance between the agn and sb components is maximum . by examining the average seds of both agn and",
    "starbursts one immediately evinces that an agn is much brighter than a starburst with equal bolometric luminosity not only in the hard x - ray domain , but also in a narrow ir band stretching from @xmath23  @xmath0 m , where the red tail of direct stellar emission begins to vanish , up to @xmath28  @xmath0 m , at the onset of the possible silicate absorption feature centred at 9.7  @xmath0 m ( see fig.[enh ] ) .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the more intense uv radiation field of the agn , which is able to heat up to the sublimation temperature the dust located in proximity of the central energy source ( @xmath111500  k for graphite grains ) . incidentally , both the above - mentioned mid - ir _ colour _ diagnostic and the previous identification of a subset of _ warm _ ulirgs ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) are based on a completely similar argument .",
    "1412 ( _ green line _ ) by that of our sb template , whose definition is described later on in this section .",
    "the shaded regions show the 1@xmath12  _ rms _ uncertainty , and the spectral resolution has been degraded in order to smooth the dependence of the ratios from narrow features .",
    "the three objects appear as agn - dominated at a visual inspection , with moderate reddening , significant absorption and/or suppression of aromatic features .",
    "after our analysis , the agn bolometric contribution to each source turns out to exceed 80 per cent .",
    "it is clear how the agn spectral enhancement rapidly decreases with increasing wavelengths , giving rise to a dilution effect that precludes the detection of intrinsically faint or heavily obscured agn components . concerning the _ red curve _ , the prominent 10  @xmath0 m bump and the following plateau are exclusively due to the lack of silicate absorption , which is unusual in composite ulirgs.,width=321 ]    it is only in the recent years that this spectral region and its potential in the study of ulirgs have been exploited quantitatively ( e.g. risaliti et al .",
    "2003 , 2006a ) .",
    "in particular , _ l_-band spectroscopy ( @xmath234  @xmath0 m ) has proven to be a powerful method to uncover a buried agn inside a ulirg , thanks to diagnostic features like the equivalent width of the 3.3  @xmath0 m pah emission and the continuum slope ( risaliti et al .",
    "specifically , a steeply rising continuum hints at the reddening of a point - like energy source ; an obscured agn interpretation can be also supported by the simultaneous detection of deep absorption profiles at @xmath23.4 and @xmath24.5  @xmath0 m due to aliphatic hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide , respectively ( sani et al .",
    "ground - based observations are anyway affected by the strong variability of atmospheric transmission and the high thermal background .",
    "for this reason the quality of the current _ l_- and _ m_-band spectra , even if obtained with large - aperture facilities like subaru and vlt , allows the determination of the agn and sb components for only the @xmath220 brightest ulirgs . in this view , the spectral capabilities at 2.55  @xmath0 m of the akari satellite look very promising ( e.g. oyabu et al .",
    "+ a significant progress has been possible thanks to _ spitzer _ , whose spectrograph operates longward of 5  @xmath0 m and provides the natural extension of our diagnostic study .",
    "the luminosity enhancement of the agn over the sb component is expected to substantially fade and turn over with increasing wavelength ( fig.[enh ] ) , none the less at 58  @xmath0 m the considerably higher accuracy achieved from space still overrides this effect and allows a precise determination of the agn and starburst properties in a composite ulirg . before proceeding with the details of our diagnostic technique ,",
    "it is worth exploring the possibility for a luminous but extremely obscured agn to be missed even at 58  @xmath0 m .",
    "we consider the test case of a source whose ir luminosity arises in equal parts from nuclear activity and star formation .",
    "a contribution of 20 per cent to the observed 58  @xmath0 m emission can be assumed as a reasonable detection limit for the agn component , which intrinsically is expected to outshine the starburst counterpart by a factor @xmath22030 in this spectral range .",
    "consequently , the agn should undergo a flux attenuation of @xmath22 orders of magnitude in order to fall below the detection threshold . in terms of a standard extinction law",
    "this corresponds to a screen extinction of @xmath13200  mag ( @xmath140.025 ; nishiyama et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "this scenario is possible but unlikely ( see also section  [ ae ] and the discussion in genzel et al .",
    "we are then confident that virtually all the luminous agn components inside ulirgs can be probed through 58  @xmath0 m _ spitzer_-irs spectra .",
    "+ the unprecedented sensitivity of the mid - ir capabilities onboard _ spitzer _ , in fact , has made it possible to reconstruct with high precision the seds of large samples of luminous active nuclei and starburst galaxies , and a surprising spectral homogeneity has been found within the two separate classes . at the highest luminosities this is especially true in the 58  @xmath0 m range , with nearly constant shapes of both the aromatic complex in starbursts ( brandl et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter b06 ) and the continuum in agn ( netzer et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter n07 ) .",
    "larger differences come out at longer wavelengths , where the temperature and emissivity of the different dust components as well as radiative transfer need to be taken into account .",
    "our strategy then aims at disentangling the agn and sb contributions to the observed 58  @xmath0 m emission of ulirgs by means of spectral templates , whose success hinges upon the large difference between the average agn / sb emission and the small dispersion within the agn and sb spectral classes . in the following we explain in detail the physical reasons which justify the selection of the agn and sb templates for this work .",
    "+ _ starburst .",
    "_ as previously mentioned , the mid - ir spectra of starburst galaxies display little variations from one object to another , especially in the 58  @xmath0 m wavelength range . at first sight",
    "this appears to be a singular circumstance , because of the large number of physical variables involved in determining the observed properties of a starburst : these include the initial mass function , the duration and evolutionary stage of the single bursts , the properties of the dust grains and those of the interstellar environment , and obviously the total mass and luminosity of the system .",
    "it has already been suggested in b06 that such a remarkable similarity can derive from the spatial integration over a huge number of unresolved star - forming spots : this is indeed an interesting point that should be investigated further .",
    "the typical sb emission in the 58  @xmath0 m interval is characterized by two prominent aromatic features centred at 6.2 and 7.7  @xmath0 m . in sb - dominated ulirgs the shape of these lines and",
    "their intensity ratio slightly differ from those observed in lower luminosity starbursts ( like ngc  7714 ) , probably because of higher obscuration in the former ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "moreover the reliability of pahs as quantitative tracers of star formation is still debated ( peeters , spoon & tielens 2004 ; frster schreiber et al .",
    "2004 ) . in order to properly describe the sb component in our spectra , and check",
    "if the prescription of little dispersion may be applied in the ulirg luminosity range as well , we performed a preliminary analysis on a representative subset of sources that other multiband diagnostics have established to host powerful starbursts .",
    "the 58  @xmath0 m emission of these sources has been approximated by means of two gaussian profiles for the aromatic features and a power - law continuum , hence all the spectral indices of the power - law components in the following are defined as @xmath15 . ] . as a result ,",
    "the main properties of the pah features turn out to be the same observed in lower luminosity systems .",
    "their equivalent width is confirmed not to depend on the global ir output , and the modest spread concerning their relative strength has already been related to internal obscuration ; the slope of the underlying continuum is @xmath164 , roughly uniform and well above the value assumed for the agn component ( see later ) .",
    "this tight correlation between the properties of the pah features and the dust continuum is brought out also in b06 , hence we are justified in the use of a spectral template to represent through a single scale factor the sb component of ulirgs .",
    "a complete characterization of the whole sb spectrum would of course require a detailed model involving many parameters , and this indeed remains unavoidable when considering larger spectral domains .",
    "+ instead of adopting a prototypal sb template from the literature , we have constructed a new one as the average spectrum of the five brightest sb - dominated sources in our sample , i.e. iras  10190@xmath171322 , iras  12112@xmath170305 , iras  17208@xmath180014 , iras  20414@xmath181651 and iras  22491@xmath181808 .",
    "the resulting slope is @xmath194.2 , and the equivalent widths of the aromatic features are 0.43 and 0.88  @xmath0 m : such values do not actually differ from the measures of b06 , as can be easily evinced from fig.[sbt ] .",
    "m. their behaviour up to @xmath230  @xmath0 m is outlined in a log - log scale in the top left corner .",
    "the single spectra of the five sources employed in our template have also been plotted with lines of different colour : iras  10190@xmath171322 ( _ light green _ ) , iras  12112@xmath170305 ( _ red _ ) , iras  17208@xmath180014 ( _ magenta _ ) , iras  20414@xmath181651 ( _ orange _ ) and iras  22491@xmath181808 ( _ cyan_).,width=321 ]    the comparison between our sb template and that of b06 over the entire irs spectral range has already been shown in paper  i , in order to emphasize their divergence just longward of @xmath28  @xmath0 m .",
    "this is anyway displayed again in the box of fig.[sbt ] , where we focus instead on their similarity over the wavelengths of interest .",
    "such similarity ( and the fact that the pah equivalent widths are the largest among ulirgs ) rules out any possibility of significant agn contamination in our sb template .",
    "+ summarizing , the spectral slope of the observed 58  @xmath0 m ulirg continuum is very sensitive to the possible agn contribution .",
    "the pah features and their intensities play of course an important role in modelling the spectral shape , but the dispersion in their properties which is found in pure starbursts is actually too small to alter the determination of the continuum , mimicking the presence of a bolometrically significant agn in a composite source .",
    "+ _ active galactic nucleus .",
    "_ at the wavelengths of concern the agn emission is dominated by the cooling of small dust grains that are transiently heated up to temperatures close to the sublimation limit .",
    "such a process is expected to produce a nearly featureless power - law continuum , and yet aromatic features are found in several quasars , as confirmed by recent observations ( schweitzer et al .",
    "2006 ; lutz et al . 2007 , 2008 )",
    ". the inferred star formation rate can be very high , and raises the question on the extent of the stellar contamination in the observed spectra of quasars and the reliability of a pure agn template . in n07 the far - ir emission of a large set of palomar - green ( pg ) quasars is ascribed to cold dust in extended regions , and then suspected of having a stellar origin ; the contribution of star formation to be subtracted in order to determine the intrinsic sed of a type 1 agn is obtained from the properties of 12 sb - dominated ulirgs .",
    "the resulting average spectrum can be modelled by a single power law from @xmath23  @xmath0 m to the 9.7  @xmath0 m silicate bump ( which usually appears in emission whenever the source is not obscured ) .",
    "the most striking outcome is that the spectral dispersion at these wavelengths is very small if compared to the large differences found in the far - ir .",
    "it is then reasonable to adopt a power - law component to reproduce the 58  @xmath0 m agn flux density .",
    "the choice of the spectral index however is not immediate , and has to be briefly discussed . a coarse estimate ,",
    "as deduced from the seds provided by n07 , yields @xmath200.7 ; a better value can be anyway achieved from our _ l_-band study .",
    "the reason is that we are dealing with an active nucleus component in a ulirg environment , and the overall dust properties are expected to differ from those of the pg quasars in the n07 sample .",
    "_ rms _ dispersion .",
    "the best fit ( _ red dashed curve _ ) requires two components : a power law with spectral index 1.51@xmath210.09 , and a gaussian line with equivalent width @xmath22  nm , far below the typical values of the pah emission in starburst galaxies ( @xmath2100  nm).,width=321 ]    in fig.[ind ] we show the spectral template obtained by averaging the _ l_-band emission of four ulirgs in our sample known to host a fairly unobscured active nucleus : mrk  231 , iras  15462@xmath170450 and iras  21219@xmath181757 , which are optically classified as type 1 seyfert galaxies , and iras  05189@xmath182524 , which is a type 2 .",
    "for all these sources the _",
    "l_-band emission consists of a strong continuum arising from the dust heated by the agn , as also confirmed by the small equivalent width of the 3.3  @xmath0 m aromatic feature , only reaching a few nm while usually exceeding @xmath2100  nm in pure starbursts ( moorwood 1986 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) .",
    "the mean value of the continuum slope is @xmath21.5 , and such a value has then been assumed for the present analysis .",
    "its extrapolation to 58  @xmath0 m is supported by n07 , since no significant change in the continuum gradient is expected .",
    "moreover the same 58  @xmath0 m spectra of the four template sources are fully consistent with the stretching of their _",
    "l_-band slope , in spite of the growing aromatic emission .",
    "the slight discrepancy between these estimates of the agn spectral index , based on different samples , seems to be a natural consequence of the greater obscuration characterizing the ulirg environment , rather than of a significant stellar contamination even at such short wavelengths .",
    "as mentioned , the unobscured agn components of this work and the pg quasars of n07 ( even though intense star formation is in place ) are different populations , in terms of both the luminosity of the agn and the properties of the absorbing medium",
    ". a higher covering factor of the dust surrounding the agn component in a ulirg environment can account for a steeper intrinsic slope .",
    "the covering factor is indeed shown to decrease as a function of the agn luminosity ( maiolino et al .",
    "+ beyond these aspects , another crucial effect has to be considered : the active nucleus component is still extremely compact , and the agn - related hot dust emission can be extinguished by an external screen , consisting either of the outer layers of the obscuring torus predicted in unification models ( antonucci 1993 ) or of a thick absorbing cloud along the line of sight .",
    "we have therefore introduced a wavelength dependent attenuation factor @xmath23 , assuming for the optical depth a power - law behaviour @xmath24 ( draine 1989 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the sb component can easily extend over several hundreds of pc and therefore can be affected exclusively by internal extinction , which is already embodied in the shape of the template : in fact , even if the sb extinction becomes apparent when considering the silicate absorption profiles at longer wavelengths , the 58  @xmath0 m emission does not seem to be significantly modified except for the limited dispersion in the pah ratio . + in section  [ dis ] we will deal again ( from a quantitative point of view ) with the intrinsic slope of the agn continuum emission , investigating its interplay with the shape of the extinction law , and how any change can affect the agn / sb spectral decomposition and the subsequent estimate of the relative agn / sb bolometric contribution .",

    "the consequent bias is then minor , and will be discussed later on when we assess the incidence of black hole accretion and star formation at extreme ir luminosities .",

    "1995 , respectively ) would yield a wealth of additional sources fulfilling the present criteria .",

    ", it is also important to specify that the total ir luminosity of our sources has been computed according to the broadband flux equation in sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total ir flux in units of ergs s@xmath32 @xmath8 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the iras flux densities in jy .",
    "when only an upper limit is available for @xmath33 ( and @xmath34 ) we have simply assumed the one half of this limit .",

    "the spectroscopic observations of all the sources in our sample were obtained with the _ spitzer_-irs low - resolution modules , within three different programs devoted to buried activity in ulirgs and massive mergers : the program ids are 105 , 2306 and 3187 , and the principal investigators are j.r.houck , m.imanishi and s.veilleux , respectively .",
    "the details concerning each observation are listed in tab.[t2 ] .",
    "the local ulirgs of our sample are _ bright _ objects , and their signal can be easily distinguished from the background emission , mostly due to zodiacal light .",
    "after having verified that a refined reduction of the data was not necessary for our purposes , we decided to perform our analysis beginning from the coadded images provided by the _",
    "spitzer science center_. a coadded image is obtained as the average over multiple telescope pointings . at this stage",
    "the individual snapshots have been already processed with the default pipeline ( versions 13.0 and upgrades ) , that among other basic operations includes the linearization and the fitting of the signal ramp , the dark subtraction and the flat - fielding . since each observation in staring mode",
    "consists of two exposures with different position of the source along the slit , we have subtracted the background emission by taking the difference between the couple of images in the nodding cycle .",
    "the spectra have been extracted following the standard steps for point - like sources within the software ` spice ` .",
    "the flux uncertainties have been computed considering the typical poissonian distribution for source and background counts .",
    "the latter are estimated from the companion coadded images , since the off - source subslit provides the background of the nodded on - source observation . +",
    "while the wavelength calibration is not a crucial issue in this work , a precise flux calibration is required to derive a reliable estimate of the relative agn / sb contribution to the bolometric luminosity ( see section  [ ae ] ) . in the older versions of the processing pipeline",
    "the accuracy of the absolute flux calibration for the _ spitzer_-irs low - resolution orders was quoted to be about 20 per cent .",
    "even with such a coarse evaluation our final results are not substantially modified , hence the _ spitzer _ calibration as been adopted .",
    "we have anyway checked its reliability against the photometric data provided by iras . for 53 sources ( corresponding to 75 per cent of our sample ) the 12  @xmath0 m",
    "iras flux density is only an upper limit , which is always higher than the _",
    "spitzer_-irs equivalent . for 16 sources",
    "not even the iras flux at 25  @xmath0 m is available , while in all the remaining cases the _ spitzer _ measure turns out to be fully consistent with the iras one ( it is indeed slightly lower on average , by @xmath220 per cent at most ) .",
    "even if the analysis is restricted to a narrow spectral range and only the short - low ( sl ) orders are involved , we performed the extraction of the long - low ( ll ) orders as well , so that we have the entire @xmath2535  @xmath0 m spectra of more than 60 sources . only in a few cases",
    "a slight rescaling is necessary for a smooth connection between sl1 and ll2 orders , and this can not introduce any systematic effect on the measured 25  @xmath0 m flux .",
    "aperture losses at long wavelengths can indeed occur when comparing the narrow - slit irs spectroscopy to the large - aperture iras photometry .",
    "whatever the right explanation may be , we conclude that the _ spitzer_-irs calibration at 58  @xmath0 m is fully reliable , and that the normalization of our spectra to match the iras fluxes , however not possible for the whole sample , is not even required .",
    "the use of spectral templates to model the intrinsic agn and sb components significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom in our analytical description .",
    "the decomposition method has already been introduced and discussed in detail in paper  i , nevertheless it is useful to examine again the main steps . by defining the 6  @xmath0m ",
    "normalized agn and sb templates @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the observed 58  @xmath0 m ulirg emission can be parameterized as follows : @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the agn contribution to the intrinsic ( de - absorbed ) flux density @xmath50 . along with the optical depth to the active nucleus @xmath51(6  @xmath0 m ) and",
    "apart from the flux normalization , @xmath49 is the only degree of freedom in our model .",
    "the best fits have been found via the minimization of the @xmath52 . in spite of the large differences observed in our ulirg spectra ,",
    "this simple model always provides a good match to the data .",
    "though the best fits have usually a reduced @xmath532 and are not formally acceptable in a statistical sense ( due to the use of templates that ignores minor features , and the small _ spitzer_-irs error bars ) both the aromatic emission and the continuum shape are well reproduced , with residuals smaller than 10 per cent at all wavelengths .",
    "+ the fitting procedure allows the determination of @xmath50 as well , hence we can compute the ratio between the absorption - corrected 6  @xmath0 m luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of each source , defined as @xmath54 where @xmath31 is the total ir flux introduced in eq.([e1 ] ) . since the equivalent quantities for pure agn and pure starbursts (",
    "hereafter indicated respectively as @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) are widely different from each other , @xmath57 is itself an indicator of the significance of agn activity within composite sources , and can be used both to test the consistency of our decomposition method and to assess the relative agn / sb contribution in terms of bolometric luminosity . by rendering explicit the agn and sb components within eq.([eq ] ) respectively as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and decomposing @xmath31 as @xmath60 , the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath49 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be brought out through a simple algebra : @xmath61 this theoretical @xmath57@xmath49 relation has been fitted to our data , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 as floating variables . in paper",
    "i we obtained that @xmath6228 ; we have anyway decided to repeat the evaluation of these critical parameters , because some fits have been improved with respect to the previous work and three extra sources have been added to the sample .",
    "the new results are in good agreement with the previous ones : @xmath63 taking @xmath6223 , we are able to provide a quantitative estimate of the agn contribution ( @xmath64 ) to the bolometric luminosity of each source , as @xmath65 the values of @xmath66 are listed in tab.[t3 ] .",
    "incidentally , it should be noted that a value @xmath67 is not reached even in optically bright quasars , since the contamination from star formation activity is always present and non - negligible . in fig.[np]a",
    "we show the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath66 , which can be expressed in the neat and manifest form @xmath68 by inverting eq.[ab ] . +     between intrinsic 6  @xmath0 m and bolometric luminosity versus the agn bolometric contribution @xmath66 .",
    "the error bars of @xmath57 are mainly due to the uncertainties in the total ir flux @xmath69 .",
    "the _ red solid curve _ traces the best fit of the @xmath57@xmath49 relation from eq.[ra ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the sources follow a very regular pattern and no evidence of outliers is found . _",
    "( b ) _ same as above , with the ratios for the agn and sb components plotted separately . the _ red dashed lines _",
    "mark the best values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the agreement among the sb components at different values of @xmath66 proves the reliability of our method ( see the discussion in the text).,width=321 ]    the regularity of the pattern shaped by the location of the sources in this plot is in itself a qualitative validation of our method .",
    "we have anyway performed a further test of self - consistency , by computing for each source the following quantities : @xmath70.\\ ] ] although this argument may appear as fully circular , it indeed provides a strong confirmation of our approach .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig.[np]b , the ratios @xmath71 for the sb component in composite sources ( which depend on our agn / sb decomposition ) agree within the dispersion with those for sb - dominated ulirgs ( which conversely are directly measured ) .",
    "such agreement would be lost both in case of missed agn detections and in case of fake agn detections , since the global ir flux is sensitive to the actual agn contribution .",
    "+ the present method is then reliable in detecting genuine agn components and in extrapolating the average agn / sb contribution to the bolometric luminosities .",
    "moreover , in spite of its simplicity , it proves to be effective when compared to other diagnostics at different wavelengths , as discussed in the next section .",
    "it is important however to underline that the scatter in @xmath72 and @xmath71 is significantly larger than the uncertainty on the best values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the reduced @xmath52 of the @xmath57@xmath49 relation varies slowly within a region of the parameter space that roughly corresponds to the dispersion around the best fit in fig.[np]a .",
    "we then emphasize that such a dispersion ( @xmath20.3 dex , nearly constant with respect to @xmath66 ) is to be considered the real uncertainty in the 6  @xmath0 m to bolometric ratios for the agn and sb components of individual objects ( as opposed to the ensemble averages ) .",
    "this can slightly affect the estimates of @xmath66 , increasing the statistical errors reported in tab.[t3 ] as well .",
    "nevertheless the results are precise enough to establish the magnitude of the agn / sb contribution both to the luminosity of individual sources and to the overall energy output of local ulirgs .",
    "+        as mentioned , many x - ray observations suggest the possible presence in ngc  6240 of a pair of supermassive black holes hidden behind large column densities of screening material .",
    "a detailed ir study pivoted on the _",
    "spitzer_-irs spectrum and integrated with photometric data from near- to far - ir is presented by armus et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . as a result of the sed modelling a hot dust component at @xmath2700  k",
    "is found , accounting for @xmath23.5 per cent of the bolometric luminosity and pointing to the presence of a buried agn .",
    "the agn contribution is again estimated as @xmath235 per cent through high - ionization lines , but can raise up to @xmath22024 per cent if correcting the [ ne  v]/[ne  ii ] ratio for the extinction derived from the hard x - ray data .",
    "our estimate of @xmath66 ( 4.511.5 per cent ) is then fully reliable , in spite of the great simplicity of our method as opposed to a multicomponent fit of the whole ir sed , which is anyway necessary to fully characterize an individual source .",
    "the following panels illustrate the results of our agn / sb decomposition at 58  @xmath0 m . along with the data points ( _",
    "green filled circles _ ) and the best fit model ( _ black solid line _ ) , both contributions are plotted : the sb component ( _ red dot - dashed line _ ) and the observed agn continuum ( _ blue long - dashed line _ ) ."
