    "transition metal oxides are of great current interest because of the wide variety of the ordered phases that they exhibit and the strong sensitivity to external perturbations . @xcite among them , manganese oxides with formula @xmath3 ( @xmath4 stands for a rare earth as @xmath5 , @xmath6 represents a divalent alkali element such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 and @xmath9 the hole doping ) , known as manganites , have been studied intensively both for their very rich phase diagram and for the phenomenon of colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "@xcite this effect is often exhibited in the doping regime @xmath10 , where the ground state of the systems is ferromagnetic . the ferromagnetic phase is usually explained by invoking the double exchange mechanism in which hopping of an outer - shell electron from a @xmath11 to a @xmath12 site is favored by a parallel alignment of the core spins .",
    "@xcite in addition to the double - exchange term that promotes hopping of the carriers , a strong interaction between electrons and lattice distortions plays a non - negligible role in these compounds giving rise to formation of polaron quasi - particles .",
    "@xcite    very recently , high quality atomic - scale `` digital '' heterostructures consisting of combination of transition metal oxide materials have been realized .",
    "indeed , heterostructures represent the first steps to use correlated oxide systems in realistic devices .",
    "moreover , at the interface , the electronic properties can be drastically changed in comparison with those of the bulk .",
    "recent examples include the formation of a thin metallic layer at the interface between band and mott insulators as , for example , between @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 oxides @xcite or between the band insulators @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",

    "not only the chemical composition but also the thickness of the constituent blocks specified by @xmath26 and @xmath27 is important for influencing the properties of superlattices .",
    "focus has been on the case @xmath28 corresponding to the average optimal hole doping @xmath1 . @xcite the superlattices exhibit a metal - insulator transition as function of temperature for @xmath29 and behave as insulators for @xmath30 .",
    "the superlattices undergo a rich variety of transitions among metal , mott variable range hopping insulator , interaction - induced efros - shklovskii insulator , and polaronic insulator .",
    "@xcite    interfaces play a fundamental role in tuning the metal - insulator transitions since they control the effective doping of the different layers .",
    "even when the system is globally insulating ( @xmath31 ) , some nonlinear optical measurements suggest that , for a single interface , ferromagnetism due to double - exchange mechanism can be induced between the two antiferromagnetic blocks .",
    "@xcite moreover , it has been found that the interface density of states exhibits a pronounced peak at the fermi level whose intensity correlates with the conductivity and magnetization .",
    "@xcite these measurements point toward the possibility of a two - dimensional half - metallic gas for the double - layer @xcite whose properties have been studied by using ab - initio density functional approaches .",
    "@xcite however , up to now , this interesting two - dimensional gas has not been experimentally assessed in a direct way by using lateral contacts on the region between the @xmath20 and @xmath24 blocks .    in analogy with thin films",
    ", strain is another important quantity in order to tune the properties of manganite heterostructures .",
    "for example , far from interfaces , inside @xmath20 , electron localization and local strain favor antiferromagnetism and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) orbital occupation .",
    "@xcite the magnetic phase in @xmath20 is compatible with the @xmath34 type .",
    "@xcite moreover , by changing the substrate , the ferromagnetism in the superlattice can be stabilized .",
    "@xcite    from the theoretical point of view , in addition to @xmath35 initio calculations , tight - binding models have been used to study manganite superlattices .",
    "effects of magnetic and electron - lattice interactions on the electronic properties have been investigated going beyond adiabatic mean - field approximations .",
    "@xcite however , the double layer with large blocks of @xmath20 and @xmath24 has not been much studied .",
    "moreover , the effects of strain have been analyzed only within mean - field approaches .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we have studied phase diagrams , spectral and optical properties for a very large bilayer @xmath36 ( up to size of @xmath2 planes relevant for a comparison with fabricated heterostructures ) starting from a tight binding model .",
    "we have developed a correlated inhomogeneous mean - field approach taking into account the effects of electron - lattice anti - adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "strain is simulated by modulating hopping and spin - spin interaction terms .",
    "we have found that a metallic ferromagnetic interface forms for a large range of the electron - lattice couplings and strain strengths .",
    "for this regime of parameters , the interactions are able to change the size of the interface region .",
    "we find the magnetic solutions that are stable at low temperature in the entire superlattice .",
    "the general structure of our solutions is characterized by three phases running along growth @xmath37-direction : antiferromagnetic phase with localized / delocalized ( depending on the model parameters ) charge carriers inside @xmath20 block , ferromagnetic state at the interface with itinerant carriers , localized polaronic @xmath38-type antiferromagnetic phase inside @xmath24 block .",
    "the type of antiferromagnetic order inside @xmath20 depends on the strain induced by the substrate .",
    "we have discussed the spectral and optical properties corresponding to different parameter regimes .",
    "due to the formation of the metallic interface , the density of states is finite at the chemical potential . with increasing the electron - phonon interaction , it gets reduced at the chemical potential , but it never vanishes even in the intermediate to strong electron - phonon coupling regime .",
    "finally , we have studied both the in - plane and out - of - plane optical conductivities pointing out that they are characterized by marked differences : the former shows a metallic behavior , the latter a transfer of spectral weight at high frequency due to the effects of the electrostatic potential well trapping electrons in @xmath20 block .",
    "the in - plane response at low frequency is mainly due to the region between the two insulating blocks , so that it can be used as a tool to assess the formation of the metallic ferromagnetic interface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the model and variational approach are introduced , in iii the results regarding the phase diagrams are discussed , in sec .",
    "iv the spectral properties and in sec .",
    "v the optical conductivities are analyzed , in the final section the conclusions .",
    "for manganite superlattices , the hamiltonian of the bulk @xmath39 has to be supplemented by coulomb terms representing the potential arising from the pattern of the @xmath5 and @xmath7 ions , @xcite thus @xmath40 in order to set up an appropriate model for the double layer , it is important to take into account the effects of the strain .",

    "@xcite as a consequence , one can infer that @xmath20 blocks are subjected to compressive strain @xmath45 and @xmath24 blocks to tensile strain @xmath46 . for the case of @xmath20 block ,",
    "the resulting higher occupancy of @xmath33 enhances the out - of - plane ferromagnetic interaction owing to the larger electron hopping out - of - plane . for the case of @xmath24 block",
    ", the reverse occurs .",
    "a suitable model for the bilayer has to describe the dynamics of the @xmath32 electrons which in @xmath20 block and @xmath24 block preferentially occupy the more anisotropic @xmath47 orbitals and more isotropic @xmath48 orbitals , respectively .",
    "for this reason , in this paper we adopt an effective single orbital approximation for the bulk manganite .    the model for the bulk takes into account the double - exchange mechanism , the coupling to the lattice distortions and the super - exchange interaction between neighboring localized @xmath49 electrons on @xmath21 ions .",
    "the coupling to longitudinal optical phonons arises from the jahn - teller effect that splits the @xmath32 double degeneracy .",

    "the first term of the hamiltonian describes the double - exchange mechanism in the limit where the intra - atomic exchange integral @xmath58 is far larger than the transfer integral @xmath51 .",

    "the long - range coulomb potential has been modulated by a factor @xmath78 inducing a fictitious finite screening - length ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this factor was added only for computational reasons since it allows to calculate the summations of the coulomb terms over the lattice indices .",
    "we have modeled the heterostructures as slabs whose in - plane size is infinite .    in order to describe the magnitude of the coulomb interaction , we define the dimensionless parameter @xmath79 which controls the charge - density distribution .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath80 can be estimated from the hopping parameter @xmath81 , lattice constant @xmath82 , and typical value of dielectric constant @xmath83 to be around @xmath84 .",
    "strain plays an important role also by renormalizing the heterostructure parameters .",
    "strain effects can be simulated by introducing an anisotropy into the model between the in - plane hopping amplitude @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 indicating nearest neighbors in the @xmath87 planes ) and out - of - plane hopping amplitude @xmath88 ( with @xmath89 indicating nearest neighbors along @xmath37 axis ) .",
    "@xcite moreover , the strain induced by the substrate can directly affect the patterns of core spins .",
