    "while extreme starburst galaxies and major mergers represent only a small fraction of galaxies observed today , observational and theoretical arguments suggest that most massive galaxies must have evolved through at least one active starburst and merger phase , transforming spirals into massive ellipticals and triggering the most rapid and intense star - formation known in the universe .",
    "the last decades have brought significant progress in understanding the formation of elliptical galaxies with the following picture emerging : during a merger process , tidal torques drive rapid inflows of gas into the centers of galaxies while violent relaxation acts on stars present in gas - rich progenitor disks producing the remnant spheroid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the highest phase - space density material can be found in the galactic centers , which comes from gas dissipation in the final , merger - induced central starburst imprinting a central `` extra light '' component or stellar `` cusp '' into the surface brightness profiles of merger remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    in particular the advent of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has brought sufficient angular resolution to reveal the nuclear light profiles in large samples of early - type galaxies and merger remnants .",
    "evidence for a nuclear cusp build - up has been found in a significant fraction of these early - type galaxies and merger remnants @xcite .",
    "moreover , these observations suggest that ellipticals can be separated into two different types of nuclear brightness profiles , namely cusp ( characterised by a steep inner slope ) and core ellipticals ( flat profile towards the center ) .",
    "follow - up studies have shown a strong dependence on the optical luminosity of the host galaxy , leading to a dichotomy between core and cusp galaxies , with core galaxies dominating at the highest luminosities and cusp galaxies at the lowest @xcite .",
    "the finding that giant elliptical galaxies are slow rotating and low - luminosity elliptical galaxies rapidly rotating ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the formation of cores and cusps is linked to the dynamics of the merger process or progenitors ( see for recent review * ? ? ?",
    "the most popular explanation is that cusp galaxies are produced in dissipative , gas - rich ( ` wet ' ) mergers , while core galaxies are produced in dissipationless , gas - poor ( ` dry ' ) mergers @xcite .",
    "several studies suggest that merger progenitors of core ellipticals may have been even different from all galaxies seen today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are very unlikely cusp ellipticals @xcite .",
    "recent observations also indicate that the central stellar light deficit @xmath3 in core ellipticals is correlated with the mass of the central stellar bh @xcite and that core and cusp galaxies might follow a different m@xmath4-m@xmath5 relation @xcite .",
    "this would suggest a slightly different mechanism linking the formation of the central massive black hole with its host galaxy evolution .",
    "however , until recently there has been little observational evidence on the build - up of these cusps during the actual merger - induced starburst stage .",
    "while previous ground - based observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that a significant fraction of merger remnants seems to exhibit radial profiles similar to elliptical galaxies based on their large - scale appearance ( at radii of several kpc ) , we are now able to link for the first time the stellar light distribution and merger - induced starburst in the central kpc for a large sample of nearby active starburst mergers .    in particular one galaxy population , the luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs : i.e. , @xmath6=l(81000@xmath7 m ) based on iras 12@xmath7 m , 25@xmath7 m , 60@xmath7 m and 100@xmath7 m flux densities as defined in @xcite ] ) , provides a perfect laboratory to test current theories about the formation of nuclear cusps and elliptical galaxies .",
    "although very rare at low - redshift , lirgs are @xmath01000 times more abundant and dominate the total ir energy density emitted at red - shifts of z@xmath012 when star formation in the universe was at its peak and most of the galaxies stellar mass is building up @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength imaging surveys of local lirgs and ultra lirgs ( ulirgs , @xmath8 ) have shown that with increasing ir luminosity , the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the fraction of sources hosting an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and the fraction of sources with interaction features significantly increases @xcite .",
    "moreover , the projected nuclear separation in sources with double nuclei is significantly smaller for ulirgs than for lirgs @xcite , confirming the picture that most ulirgs evolve at a later merger stage than lirgs .",
    "however , due to high column densities of gas and dust , it is almost impossible to reveal the circum - nuclear regions and to identify the nuclei in lirgs at optical wavelengths .",
    "high resolution rest - frame near - infrared ( nir ) imaging of their nuclear region with hst has revealed that the majority of ( u)lirgs with @xmath6 have double nuclei , nearly two times more than those identified in the rest - frame optical light @xcite .",
    "this , without even considering issues such as sensitivity and spatial resolution , implies strong limitations on the ability to detect the true nuclear structure and merger stage of lirgs at higher redshifts ( z @xmath9 1.5 ) , even if observed in the nir .",
    "although ( u)lirgs at high redshift likely differ in some of their properties from local ( u)lirgs ( e.g. in merger fraction , size of starburst , sfr efficiencies etc . ) due to higher gas - fractions and smaller galaxy separations at earlier epochs , high - resolution observations of local ulirgs still provide the best laboratory to study the nature of these galaxies . despite recent progress in simulating the formation of nuclear cusps via merging of gas - rich progenitor galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several important questions are still open : 1 ) how much stellar mass is typically built up in nuclear cusps and what are the critical time - scales for cusp formation ?",
    "2 ) is there a link between the strength of cusps in lirgs and the current rate of star formation in these galaxies ?",
    "3 ) is the fraction of cusps in lirgs the same as in elliptical galaxies ? do lirgs display a similar bimodality between the presence of cusps and the stellar mass of the host galaxy and what are the implications for the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and spheroids ? 4 ) are nuclear cusps present only in merger - induced starburst galaxies or can cusps also form in isolated galaxies ?",
    "if so , what is the mechanism that triggers the gas - dissipation and nuclear starburst in non - interacting galaxies with no apparent interaction features in the nir and optical light @xcite ?",
    "the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides an excellent sample to address these questions , combining high - resolution multi - wavelength hst observations ( nicmos / wfc3 h - band , acs i- and b - band ) with mid and far - ir diagnostics ( spitzer irs , irac , mips , herschel pacs , spire ) for a complete sample of ( u)lirgs in the local universe .",
    "moreover , a wealth of additional multi - wavelength data is available , ranging from x - ray ( chandra ) , uv ( galex ) to radio ( jvla , atca ) and sub - mm observations ( carma , alma ) .",

    "we combine our previous hst nicmos h - band sample with new wfc3 h - band observation for the remaining galaxies of the high - luminosity lirg sample @xmath10 , and resolve their nuclear cusps using 2-dimensional fitting of the `` nuker '' profile @xcite .",
    "this allows us to study the cusp properties in detail over a large range of merger stages and ir luminosities .",

    "we carefully applied a wcs transformation to our nicmos and wfc3 images given the corrected hst acs images using corresponding reference points in both images , such as stars not catalogued , bright star cluster knots , or similar unresolved features .",
    "fitting the light profile of galaxies is far from trivial and the choice of the appropriate profile fit function depends on the structural components , physical scales , and the galaxy types of interest . for this study",
    "we have chosen the nuker profile which was introduced by @xcite to fit the nuclear profile of nearby galaxies observed with hst and is a double power law with the parametric form @xmath18^{(\\gamma-\\beta)/\\alpha } \\label{eq : nuker}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the outer power law slope , @xmath20 the inner slope , @xmath21 is the `` break radius '' between the outer and inner profile , and @xmath22 moderates the sharpness of the transition ( more rapid transition with larger @xmath22 ) .",
    "although the nuker profile is very well suited to describe the central region of galaxies , it does not link the outer profile with a physical representation of large - scale galaxy features ( such as bars , bulge , disk ) .",
    "however , the typical radii of cusps are 1001000  pc ( on average 250  pc ) , which is well within the limits of the nuker profile . while single and double srsic profiles have been applied to measure the cusp in ellipticals in some studies as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a combination of srsic profiles would lead to degeneracies in fitting more complicated structures such as a combination of disk , bulge , and cusp which is more typical in lirgs .",
    "we have tested a combination of multiple srsic profiles , but found that fitting simultaneously all structural components of a galaxy would reveal reasonable results only in very few lirgs without complicated structure .",
    "the argument against a full decomposition of the entire galaxy s structure is that every component fit is strongly dependent on the outcome of the other components , which would a ) make the interpretation of the multiple srsic profiles difficult and b ) would not allow a coherent measurement of the cusp over the large morphological variety of lirgs .",
    "the main advantage of the nuker profile is that it is not an extrapolation of the outer galaxy profile and does not depend on the large - scale structure of a galaxy unlike a single or combination of multiple srsic profiles .      to derive detailed information about the structural properties of lirgs we performed a 2-dimensional decomposition of all galaxies in our sample using galfit @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on an accurate measurement of the central light component , in particular the nuclear slope as parametrized by the nuker profile to obtain the cusp and core properties of lirgs .",
    "this approach focuses on an accurate parametrization of the very center ( @xmath23 ) , in particular the stellar cusp , which appears at much smaller scales than those of our previous hst nicmos study @xcite where we used multiple srsic component fits @xcite to decompose the galaxy primarily into bulge and disk component ( this is not possible with a nuker profile ) . the surface brightness profile which is fitted in equation [ eq : nuker ]",
    "is defined as @xmath24 where the image exposure time @xmath25 is in seconds , the pixel scale @xmath26 and @xmath27 in arcsec and magzpt is the magnitude zeropoint . in",
    "all there are a total of 9 parameters to fit ( @xmath28 , and the inclination and position angle of the galaxy ) .",
    "nearly 15% of the galaxies in our sample are not suitable for fitting their nuclear profiles which is caused by several circumstances : highly disturbed center , dust obscuration in edge on galaxies , and dominant strong point sources .",
    "we performed a careful analysis of each galaxy and identified the cases where a nuclear fit would not work or might lead to large uncertainties .",
    "however , most of these galaxies are selected out due to their geometrical alignment ( edge on ) and hence do nt introduce a physical selection bias .",
    "this results in a representative sample of 81 galaxies for which we have obtained nuclear nuker profiles .",
    "running galfit on an image requires some initial preparation .",
    "the desired fitting region and sky background must be provided , and the hst instrumental point spread function ( psf ) image , bad pixel mask ( if needed ) , and pixel noise map must be generated .",
    "the integrated galaxy counts per second are converted to an apparent vega magnitude ( see more details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the required hst psf image is simulated with the tinytim code @xcite using a pixel scale identical to that of the observations , and the uncertainty images are generated by the hst reduction pipeline and used as weighting images required for galfit to perform the @xmath29 minimization . the psf image is utilized to fit the unresolved component in the centers of these galaxies , which can originate either from a central agn or nuclear star formation .",
    "after these preparation steps we carried out an iterative fitting process since galfit requires initial guesses for each component it fits and uses a levenberg - marquardt downhill - gradient algorithm to determine the minimum @xmath29 based on the input guesses . at first we fitted nuker profiles that are centered on the galaxies nuclei ( typically 1 - 2 nuclei per image ) . for merger systems that have of two or more galaxies",
    ", we take advantage of galfits ability to fit simultaneously multiple components at different spatial regions .",
    "initial parameter guesses for the center , position angle , inclination and sky - background have been estimated with srsic profiles @xcite , but have been kept free for the new model fit .",
    "a psf fit has been tested for all sources but only applied in the final fit for those where a galfit solution was found .",
    "the center coordinates were fixed when it was necessary ( e.g. in cases where psf and nuker profile centers drift too far away due to starburst region or other components that might mimic a point source ) . in several cases",
    "we have tested a range of fitting regions to obtain the best fit of the transition between outer and inner profiles .",
    "the outer radius used for the fitting is typically 13  kpc , which is roughly 310 times the cusp radius , which is defined here as the break radius of the nuker law .",
    "one important point to be cautioned about when using the nuker profile is to ensure that the transition parameter @xmath22 is large enough to separate inner and outer profile because , for example , a low @xmath22 value ( @xmath302 ) can be reproduced by simultaneously having a high @xmath20 and a low @xmath19 , which is a serious possibility for degeneracy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in cases where @xmath22 behaved unreasonably , either @xmath31 or @xmath32 , we tested several values in the range of @xmath33 , and fixed @xmath22 at the value for which the best solution was found .",
    "fitted models were selected only as long as the model parameters were all well behaved , i.e. requiring that all parameters such as break radius , inner / outer slope values , and transition parameter converged within the range of reasonable values .",
    "the best fit was chosen based on the @xmath34 for each model and the quality of the residual image . since this study focuses only on the nuclear parametrization we have not attempted to find a perfect solution for the entire galaxy , for which the nuker profile fitting is likely not suited in any case .",
    "all in all we have tried to find the most robust fit for the nuclear slope that can be applied in a homogeneous way among all sources in our sample using one main component ( plus a psf - component ) rather than splitting the model , e.g. , in three or more srsic profiles ( cusp , bulge , disk , bar , etc . ) which introduces many more free parameters and possible interpretations",
    ".      cusps manifest themselves as strong central excess light on top of the normal light profile of a galaxy ( i.e. , stellar bulge , disk and often a bar ) .",
    "a typical example of a strong cusp galaxy is ngc  1614 whose hst and galfit residual image are presented in fig .",

    "the size of the cusp is similar to the spatial size of pa@xmath22 emission ( see   [ subsec : paschen ] ) which is a strong indicator of on - going star - formation on the cusp scale .",
    "this demonstrates that the stellar cusp is linked to the current star formation in this galaxy .",
    "the residual image reveals a nuclear spiral structure and a large number of circum - nuclear cluster , but typically at less than one magnitude lower surface brightness than the cusp .",

    "a scenario of outward propagating star formation would explain the lack of star - formation within the nuclear stellar cusp since most of the gas is likely already consumed or expelled from the inside of the stellar cusp .",
    "however , only a larger sample of high - resolution images of star - formation tracers and gas / stellar kinematics can answer in detail the question how the current star - formation and gas dynamics are linked to the build - up of the stellar cusp .",
    "it is important to test the robustness of our results against possible systematic biases in our measurements .",

    "however , some factors can possibly have an impact on the measured cusp properties , in particular agn light contribution and finite spatial resolution",

    "* ) .    the second case , a spatial size dependency , is more difficult to rule out , since the spatial resolution and hence the scale on which the cusps are resolved , depends on the distance of the lirgs ( ranging from  30350  mpc for our sample ) . given the small physical sizes of the nuclear cusps",
    ", it is important to verify that finite spatial resolution is not biasing our results .",
    "this is particularly important since more ir luminous lirgs are typically found at larger distances than less luminous systems . in fig .",

    "although this rules out a statistical dependence , we have also simulated directly how the nuclear slope would change as a function of distance for a representative set of lirgs .",
    "the four lirgs tested ( ngc  3256 , ngc  3690 , ngc  2623 , and ugc  12812 ) are all nearby ( @xmath1 100mpc ) , have no strong psf component , and display different cusp slopes ( ranging from @xmath93 to @xmath94 ) . we have smoothed and resized the images using a gaussian beam and image regridding to simulate how these galaxies would appear at larger distances , changing both , their spatial resolution and angular size of the galaxies . after that we applied the same galfit procedure for each simulated galaxy to obtain the cusp parameters as a function of distance . for consistency",
    "we have fitted the same physical sky region for each simulation . as shown in fig .",

    "the break - radius is slightly more sensitive to the spatial resolution with changes of 1050% , but with no trend towards larger or smaller radius as a function of spatial resolution .",
    "these results show that the high , but limited spatial resolution of hst can not cause us to detect cusps in our lirgs where none exist , which is accordance with our expectations .    on the contrary ,",
    "if the cusp is unresolved , one would expect that its slope becomes flat ( @xmath47 ) since the cusp excess light is already taken into account by the central psf or it is just poorly constrained . for instance , in the case of a finite resolution limit , @xcite has shown that a nuker slope of @xmath97 can still have steep cusps if measured as the local slope at the resolution limit of the hst .",
