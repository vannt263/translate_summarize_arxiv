    "thermoelectric materials are of interest due to potential applications in energy conversion devices , and make essential contributions to the crisis of energy@xcite .",
    "the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath4 , defined as @xmath5 , can describe the performance of thermoelectric materials , where s , @xmath6 , t , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , working temperature , the electronic and lattice thermal conductivities , respectively .",
    "according to expression of @xmath4 , a potential thermoelectric material requires high power factor ( @xmath9 ) and low thermal conductivity ( @xmath10 ) . unfortunately , seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity are oppositely proportional to carrier concentration . to enhance the @xmath4 of bulk materials ,",
    "many strategies have been proposed , such as bands convergence to enhance the seebeck coefficient by strain or doping@xcite and phonon engineering to reduce lattice thermal conductivity by alloying or introducing layered structures@xcite . to improve @xmath4",
    ", nanostructuring is another effective way , which is firstly proposed by hicks and dresselhaus in 1993@xcite .",
    "the low - dimensional materials can dramatically improve the power factor due to the sharp peaks in the electronic density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy , which can induce asymmetry between holes and electrons transport and enhance electrical conductivity , and then can produce large seebeck coefficient .",
    "great progress by nanostructuring to enhance @xmath4 has been made , such as @xmath11@xcite , @xmath12@xcite and silicon nanowires @xcite .",
    "due to noncentrosymmetric crystal structure and strong soc , bulk bitex ( x = cl , br , i ) exhibit a giant rashba - type spin splitting@xcite . both in theory and in experiment",
    ", it is found that pressure can produce a topological transition in bitex ( x = br , i)@xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric properties of bitei have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally@xcite , and the thermoelectric performance can be enhanced in cu - intercalated bitei @xcite , through br - substitution@xcite and by pressure@xcite .",
    "experimentally , the thermoelectric properties of bitebr have also been studied , whose thermoelectric efficiency is better than that of bitei@xcite .",
    "theoretically , monolayers bitex ( x = br , i ) have been predicted based on the first - principles calculations , which can also produce a giant rashba spin splitting@xcite .",
    "recently , the thermoelectric properties of 2d materials , such as semiconducting transition - metal dichalcogenide monolayers and orthorhombic group iv - vi monolayers@xcite , have been widely investigated .        here",
    ", we investigate thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer bitebr by the first - principle calculations and boltzmann transport theory .",
    "it is found that soc has important effects on electronic transport coefficients , which has also been found in bulk bitei@xcite .",
    "the predicted average room - temperature lattice thermal conductivity for bulk bitebr is 1.48 @xmath0 , being close to experimental value 1.3 @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the scattering time can be attained by the comparison between experimental and theoretical electrical conductivity . finally , the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath4 of bulk and monolayer are calculated .",
    "it is found that monolayer has more higher peak value of @xmath4 than bulk due to better @xmath1 and lower lattice thermal conductivity , which shows monolayer can improve thermoelectric performance compared with bulk for bitebr .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall describe computational details about the first - principle and transport coefficients calculations . in the third section",
    ", we shall present the electronic structures and thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer bitebr . finally , we shall give our discussions and conclusion in the fourth section .",
    "a full - potential linearized augmented - plane - waves method within the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite is employed to study electronic structures of bulk and monolayer bitebr , as implemented in the package wien2k @xcite .",
    "the free atomic position parameters are optimized using gga of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( gga - pbe)@xcite with a force standard of 2 mry / a.u .. the soc is included self - consistently @xcite due to strong rashba spin splitting , giving rise to important effects on electronic transport coefficients .",
    "the convergence results are determined by using 5000 k - points in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) for the self - consistent calculation , making harmonic expansion up to @xmath13 in each of the atomic spheres , and setting @xmath14 for the plane - wave cut - off .",
    "the self - consistent calculations are considered to be converged when the integration of the absolute charge - density difference between the input and output electron density is less than @xmath15 per formula unit , where @xmath16 is the electron charge .",
    "based on the results of electronic structure , transport coefficients for electron part are calculated through solving boltzmann transport equations within the constant scattering time approximation ( csta ) , as implemented in boltztrap@xcite , which shows reliable results in many classic thermoelectric materials@xcite . to obtain accurate transport coefficients",
    ", we set the parameter lpfac for 10 in bulk and for 20 in monolayer , and use 4524 ( 5250 ) k - points in the irreducible bz of bulk ( monolayer ) for the energy band calculation .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivities are performed by using phono3py+vasp codes@xcite .",
    "the second order harmonic and third order anharmonic interatomic force constants are calculated by using a 3 @xmath2 3 @xmath2 3 ( 3 @xmath2 3 @xmath2 1 ) supercell and a 2 @xmath2 2 @xmath2 2 ( 2 @xmath2 2 @xmath2 1 ) supercell for bulk ( monolayer ) , respectively . to compute lattice thermal conductivities ,",
    "the reciprocal spaces of the primitive cells are sampled using the 20 @xmath2 20 @xmath2 18 ( 20 @xmath2 20@xmath17 2 ) meshes .    for 2d material ,",
    "the calculated lattice thermal conductivity depends on the length of unit cell used in the calculations along z direction@xcite , which should be normalized by multiplying lz / d , where lz is the length of unit cell along z direction and d is the thickness of 2d material , but the d is not well defined .",
    "the electrical conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity are the same with lattice thermal conductivity , which should also be normalized by multiplying lz / d . however , the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath4 is independent of the length of unit cell used in the calculations along z direction . in this work ,",
    "the length of unit cell of bulk bitebr along z direction is used as the thickness of monolayer bitebr to compare the thermoelectric properties of monolayer with ones of bulk .",
    "bulk bitebr has a layered structure along c axis with space group being @xmath18 , whose unit cell contains three atoms with bi atom sandwiched between te and br atoms , forming a triple layer . because of weak van der waals interactions between the adjacent triple layers , monolayer bitebr can be exfoliated in experiment .",
    "the schematic crystal structures of bulk and monolayer bitebr are presented in . in our calculations , the experimental values of lattice constants of bulk",
    "bitebr ( a = b=4.2699 @xmath19 , c=6.4601 @xmath19 ) are used@xcite . for transition - metal dichalcogenide monolayers and bulks like @xmath20 and @xmath21@xcite ,",
    "the experimental values of lattice constants @xmath22 between monolayer and bulk are pretty much the same .",
    "therefore , the experimental value @xmath22 of bulk bitebr is also used for monolayer bitebr .",
    "the unit cell of monolayer bitebr , containing one bi , one te and one br atoms , is constructed with the vacuum region of larger than 15 @xmath23 to avoid spurious interaction .",
    "all the free atomic positions of both bulk and monolayer are optimized within gga - pbe .",
    "the energy band structures of bulk and monolayer bitebr using gga and gga+soc are shown in .",
    "the conduction bands of both bulk and monolayer are mainly composed of the 6p - states of bi , while the valence bands are dominated by te - p and br - p states .",
    "the soc can lead to a huge reduction in the band gap .",
    "the gga and gga+soc gaps of bulk are 1.09 ev and 0.28 ev , respectively , while ones of monolayer are 1.75 ev and 0.91 ev .",
    "the gga+soc gap of bulk agrees well with other theoretical value 0.31 ev@xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that monolayer has larger gap than bulk , which is similar to semiconducting transition - metal dichalcogenide compounds .",
    "the outlines of band structures are strongly modified due to spin - orbit splitting .",
    "the splitting makes the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) of the bulk ( monolayer ) bitex deviate slightly from high symmetry a ( @xmath24 ) point , forming a significant rashba spin splitting .",
    "the rashba energy ( @xmath25 ) of bitebr , which is defined as the energy between the cbm and the band crossing point of conduction bands at high symmetry point a for bulk and @xmath24 for monolayer , are 63 mev for bulk and 16 mev for monolayer .",
    "the bulk rashba energy is in agreement with previous calculated value 55 mev@xcite .",
    "next , the electronic transport coefficients are performed using csta boltzmann theory , seebeck coefficient of which is independent of scattering time",
    ". the doping level , which is defined as electrons ( minus value ) or holes ( positive value ) per unit cell , can be simulated by simply shifting fermi level into conduction ( n - type doping ) or valence ( p - type doping ) bands within the framework of rigid band approach .",
    "the n - type doping produces the negative seebeck coefficient , while the p - type doping leads to the positive seebeck coefficient . at room temperature , seebeck coefficient s , electrical conductivity with respect to scattering time @xmath26 , power factor with respect to scattering time @xmath27 and electrical thermal conductivity with respect to scattering time @xmath28 of bulk and monolayer bitebr as a function of doping level using gga and gga+soc are shown in . for bulk",
    "bitebr , soc has a reduced effect on seebeck coefficient , which leads to soc - reduced power factor .",
    "for monolayer bitebr , soc has a slight effect on n - type seebeck coefficient , but has a obviously reduced effect on p - type seebeck coefficient .",
    "the soc influence on power factor of monolayer is the same with one on seebeck coefficient .",
    "it is found that monolayer has larger p - type seebeck coefficient than bulk , leading to larger power factor , if the scattering time @xmath29 is assumed to be the same .",
    "the p - type seebeck coefficient of bulk is larger than 200 @xmath30v / k with doping level being less than 5.9@xmath2@xmath31 , while monolayer one with doping level being less than 2.2@xmath2@xmath32 is larger than 200 @xmath30v / k .",
    "that shows monolayer has more wider doping range than bulk for efficient thermoelectric application .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivities of bulk and monolayer bitebr are calculated within the linearized phonon boltzmann equation , and the lattice thermal conductivity is assumed to be independent of doping level , which is reasonable in many thermoelectric materials@xcite .",
    "phonon band structures of bulk and monolayer bitebr are shown in .",
    "it is found that branches of bulk are linear near the @xmath24 point , while the ones of monolayer become more quadratic near the @xmath24 point .",
    "calculated results also show that the optical branches of monolayer move toward lower energy compared to ones of bulk .",
    "because of crystal symmetry of bulk , the lattice thermal conductivities along a and b axises ( the in - plane direction ) are equivalent , but they are different from one along c axis ( the cross - plane direction ) . therefore , the lattice thermal conductivities along a and c axises and the average one ( @xmath33=(@xmath34+@xmath35+@xmath36)/3 ) as a function of temperature are plotted in .",
    "calculated results show that the lattice thermal conductivity exhibits obvious anisotropy , and the lattice thermal conductivity along c axis is lower than that along a axis .",
    "the corresponding lattice thermal conductivity at 300 k is 1.93 @xmath0 along a axis and 0.57 @xmath0 along c axis , respectively .",
    "the average room - temperature lattice thermal conductivity is 1.48 @xmath0 , which is very close to experimental value 1.3 @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer along a axis ( @xmath34=@xmath35=@xmath33 ) as a function of temperature is plotted in .",
    "the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer is 1.29 @xmath0 , which is lower than average one 1.48 @xmath0 of bulk .",
    "this can be explained by the difference of phonon band structures between bulk and monolayer .",
    "monolayer has lower acoustic frequency than bulk , which means a lower group velocity of acoustic phonon modes .",
    "another thing is that the optical phonon modes and acoustic phonon modes have a slight coupling in monolayer bitebr , but a gap between optical phonon modes and acoustic phonon modes is observed for bulk bitebr .",
    "these two important factors lead to lower lattice thermal conductivity for monolayer than bulk .",
    "the power factor and electronic thermal conductivity with respect to scattering time ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) of bulk and monolayer bitebr as a function of doping level with temperature being 300 k , 600 k and 900 k using gga+soc are shown in .",
    "it is found that p - type power factor of monolayer is larger than one of bulk , and n - type power factor of monolayer is also larger than one of bulk in low doping level . calculated results show that the p - type electronic thermal conductivity of bulk is larger than one of monolayer . based on the power factor and electronic thermal conductivity , monolayer has more higher @xmath1 than bulk , where @xmath1 is defined as @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath4 is connected to @xmath1 by the relation @xmath4=@xmath1@xmath2@xmath38 . to attain the figure of merit @xmath4",
    ", only scattering time @xmath29 is unknown . here",
    ", a range of reasonable relaxation time is used in our calculations from 1 @xmath2 @xmath39 s to 1 @xmath2 @xmath40 s. the @xmath4 values of bulk and monolayer bitebr as a function of doping level with temperature being 300 , 600 and 900 k are plotted in with the scattering time @xmath29 equaling 1 @xmath2 @xmath39 s , 1 @xmath2 @xmath3 s and 1 @xmath2 @xmath40 s. as the scattering time @xmath29 increases , the @xmath4 moves toward its upper limit @xmath1 .",
    "calculated results show that monolayer has larger peak @xmath4 than bulk in both n- and p - type doping with the scattering time @xmath29 from 1 @xmath2 @xmath39 s to 1 @xmath2 @xmath40 s.    due to the complexity of various carrier scattering mechanisms , calculating scattering time @xmath41 from the first principles is difficulty and challenging , but it can be calculated by comparing experimental value of electronic conductivity with the calculated value of @xmath26 .",
    "experimentally , the electronic conductivity of bulk bitebr at room temperature is about 670 @xmath42 with n - type doping concentration @xmath43@xcite .",
    "the scattering time @xmath41 is found to be 3.3 @xmath2 @xmath3 s. the calculated seebeck coefficient with n - type doping concentration @xmath43 at 300 k is -89.5 @xmath30v / k , which is close to experimental value -115 @xmath30v / k@xcite .",
    "the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath44 with n - type doping concentration @xmath43 is calculated using @xmath41=3.3 @xmath2 @xmath3 s , and the calculated valve is 0.62 @xmath0 , which is in agreement with experimental value 0.5 @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the scattering time @xmath41 attained from bulk bitebr is also used in monolayer bitebr , and the @xmath4 values of bulk and monolayer as a function of doping level at 300k are plotted in . it is found that the peak @xmath4 values of monolayer in both n- and p - type doping are larger than ones of bulk . the n- and",
    "p - type peak @xmath4 of monolayer is 0.40 and 0.55 , respectively , and the corresponding doping level is -0.0019 and 0.0142 .",
    "the soc can produce a giant effect on energy band structures near the fermi level by removing band degeneracy and modifying the outline of bands , which can lead to remarkable reduced effects on the seebeck coefficient , and further can induce detrimental power factor .      similar detrimental effects on power factor are also found in @xmath45 ( x = si , ge , sn)@xcite , half - heusler anib ( a = ti , hf , sc , y ; b = sn , sb , bi)@xcite and semiconducting transition - metal dichalcogenide monolayers @xmath46 ( m = zr , hf , mo and pt ; x = s , se and te)@xcite .",
    "however , the soc also can lead to observably enhanced power factor in monolayers @xmath47 ( x = s , se and te ) due to the bands converge induced by soc@xcite .",
    "the maximum power factors ( mpf ) in unit of @xmath48@xmath49 of bulk in n - type doping and monolayer in p - type doping are extracted with gga and gga+soc at 300k , and the corresponding gga and gga+soc values are 12.96 and 9.00 for bulk , 55.87 and 23.68 for monolayer .",
    "the mpf with soc is predicted to be about 30.56% ( bulk ) and 57.62% ( monolayer ) smaller than that without soc .",
    "so , it is very important for electronic transport coefficients of bitebr to include soc .",
    "strain or pressure has been proved to be very effective to achieve enhanced thermoelectric properties in both bulk and 2d materials .",
    "low - dimensional electronic structures can occur in rashba semiconductor bitei@xcite , and pressure can lead to two - dimensional - like dos in the conduction bands by tuning rashba spin - splitting , which can induce significantly enhanced power factor in n - type doping by pressure@xcite .",
    "the bulk bitebr has similar energy band structures with bulk bitei , so it is possible to achieve improved power factor in bulk bitebr by pressure .",
    "strain - enhanced power factor is observed in monolayer @xmath50@xcite , @xmath51@xcite and @xmath52@xcite due to bands converge induced by strain .",
    "it has been proved that the rashba spin - splitting can be modified significantly by the biaxial strain in monolayer bitebr@xcite , and it is possible to achieve enhanced power factor in monolayer bitebr by tuning rashba spin - splitting .",
    "the thermoelectric properties of many 2d materials have been investigated@xcite , and low lattice thermal conductivity is very important to achieve potential thermoelectric materials . to compare the lattice thermal conductivities of various 2d materials ,",
    "the same thickness should be used . here ,",
    "the same thickness of 3.35 @xmath19 is used@xcite , and the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer bitebr is 2.49 @xmath0 , which is lower than that of orthorhombic group iv - vi monolayers ( 5.24@xmath5315.80 @xmath0)@xcite and semiconducting transition - metal dichalcogenide monolayers ( 18.55@xmath53261.0 @xmath0)@xcite .",
    "therefore , monolayer bitebr may be a potential 2d thermoelectric material due to lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to other well - studied 2d materials .    in summary",
