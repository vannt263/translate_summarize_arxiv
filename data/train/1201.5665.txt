    "these contributions are due to the transverse and longitudinal components of the fluctuations , respectively . in cases when both relaxation and dephasing exhibit exponential decay laws , their inverse times add to a decoherence rate @xmath8 .",

    "the ultimate goal is to mitigate and eliminate the noise leading to both types of decoherence . to this end , a more detailed understanding of the noise processes  such as magnetic - flux , critical - current , and charge fluctuations  would expedite materials science , device engineering , and the development of coherent - control methods .",

    "a distinguishing feature of our technique is that it enables the measurement of noise spectra up to frequencies limited only by the achievable measurement repetition rate .",
