    "the viscous fingering instability  @xcite occurs when one fluid displaces another of higher viscosity in the effectively two - dimensional ( 2d ) environment of a hele - shaw cell , a device composed of two thinly separated parallel glass plates . under such confined flow conditions ,",
    "the competition of surface tension , viscous forces , and pressure gradients on the two - fluid boundary induces the formation of peculiar interfacial structures in the form of fingers ( the so - called  viscous fingers \" )  @xcite .",
    "a popular version of the problem considers flow in radial geometry , where a fluid of negligible viscosity is injected at constant injection rate against a viscous fluid  @xcite . as time advances , these radially expanding fingers tend to split at their tips , developing further into a complex branched morphology .",
    "since the seminal work by saffman and taylor  @xcite , a large amount of literature has been dedicated to understanding the formation of such beautiful fingering structures . in addition to its scientific and academic importance , the study of viscous fingering is quite relevant to many industrial and technological applications ranging from flows in porous media  @xcite , enhanced petroleum recovery  @xcite , and microfluidics  @xcite to fluid mixing  @xcite , chromatographic separation processes  @xcite , and biodynamics of cell fragmentation  @xcite .    in spite of the importance of the hele - shaw flow investigations mentioned above  @xcite , where researchers focused on fingering formation and proliferation",
    ", significant progress has recently been made on a different facet of the problem , namely the possibility of minimizing or suppressing the emergence of interfacial fingering .",
    "some interesting strategies have been proposed to contain the growth of viscous fingering patterns both in quasi-2d hele - shaw cells , as well as in 3d porous media . in these studies",
    "@xcite the main purpose was to try to avoid the uprising of interfacial undulations as much as possible .",
    "it is worth noting that the possibility of strongly restraining fingering formation is of great practical interest under circumstances in which fingering growth is very undesirable like in oil recovery  @xcite , and in chromatographic separation procedures  @xcite .    one first type of viscous fingering controlling protocol has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it has been demonstrated that viscous fingers can be considerably stabilized , by modifying the basic geometry of the classic hele - shaw cell setup , while keeping constant the fluid injection rate @xmath1 ( area covered by unit time ) .",
    "for instance , al - housseiny _ et . al _",
    "@xcite have shown that fingering formation can be properly inhibited if the upper cell plate is slightly tilted , so that the hele - shaw plates are no longer exactly parallel .",
    "a related stabilization scheme has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the rigid upper cell plate is replaced by a flexible membrane .",
    "more recently , zheng and collaborators  @xcite suggested a time - dependent control strategy in which fluid injection is applied while the hele - shaw cell gap thickness is increased in time in the power - law form @xmath2 .",
    "in this situation , either the fingering instability is suppressed , or a constant number of nonsplitting fingers are maintained during the fluid displacement process .",
    "an alternative viscous fingering control and stabilization technique has been achieved in refs .",
    "@xcite just by manipulating the injection rate , and keeping the traditional hele - shaw cell geometry unchanged .",
    "meticulous experiments , analytical calculations , and sophisticated numerical simulations have demonstrated that the development of the usual multibranched interfacial fingered morphology could be constrained by properly choosing the time dependence of the injection flux @xmath0 .",
    "for example , instead of employing a constant injection routine , refs .",
    "@xcite assumed a variant injection rate which scaled with time like @xmath3 .",
    "under such circumstances , the traditional ramified fingering patterns are suppressed , and replaced by symmetric shapes containing a prescribed number of nonsplitting fingers .    in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , it has also been verified that the use of a simple two - stage piecewise constant injection process  @xcite , in which a low injection rate is followed by stronger one , is able to restrain the establishment of interfacial deformations .",
    "finally , a suggestive variational method has been utilized to systematically search for a time - dependent injection rate @xmath4 that results in proper minimization of the viscous fingering instability  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , minimization of the linear interfacial amplitudes is equivalent to minimizing an integral , so that the search for a proper time - dependent injection rate @xmath0 for restraining the development of viscous fingering ends up being a variational problem . in this framing ,",
    "the linear growth rate defines the lagrangian of the system , and the ideal @xmath0 can be obtained by solving an euler - lagrange equation .",
    "it has been found that , in the limit of large capillary numbers ( a measure of the relative strength of viscous and surface tension forces ) , the desired injection rate is remarkably simple , varying linearly with time @xmath5 .",
    "this variational approach has been successfully applied to the related problem of a more complex 3d fluid flow in a uniform porous media  @xcite .",
    "again , for large capillary number conditions , it has been shown that the proper injection rate for minimizing viscous fluid fingering in porous media is also pretty simple , varying quadratically with time , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "peculiarly , despite of their approximate nature ( in the sense that the capillary number must be large ) , these lagrangian solutions for @xmath0 are quite efficient in minimizing the amplitudes of the interfacial deformations .",
    "this lagrangian controlling scheme has also been proved effective to damp interfacial perturbations if the displaced fluid is non - newtonian  @xcite , as well as for fluid flow displacements in curved hele - shaw cells  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", it also works very well to restrain the development of interfacial disturbances in other pattern formation problems involving electric discharges and crystal growth  @xcite .    in this work , we go one step further regarding the lagrangian - based minimizing strategy proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where _ approximate solutions _ for the proper time - dependent injection rates @xmath0 to restrain viscous fluid fingering instability in hele - shaw cells and porous media have been found . here , instead of tackling the problems through a lagrangian approach ,",
    "we adopt a hamiltonian formalism .",
    "it turns out that , by employing a hamiltonian scheme , we were able to find _ exact solutions _",
    "( i.e. , valid for arbitrary values of the capillary number ) for the desired @xmath0 both in quasi-2d hele - shaw flows and in 3d porous media displacements . in this framework ,",
    "comparisons between approximate and exact solutions of @xmath0 for both physical systems are provided , and the accuracy of the approximate lagrangian approach presented in  @xcite is discussed .",
    "we consider a radial hele - shaw cell of gap spacing @xmath7 , initially containing a viscous incompressible fluid of viscosity @xmath8 .",
    "then , a fluid of negligible viscosity is injected into the viscous fluid at injection rate @xmath1 ( equal to the area covered per unit time ) , which may depend on time .",
    "notice that this is the most unstable viscosity - driven situation ( maximum viscosity contrast case ) , which is the most challenging to control the development of fingering instabilities .",
    "both fluids are newtonian , and between them there exists a surface tension @xmath9 .",
    "we describe the perturbed fluid - fluid interface as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the azimuthal angle ( @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 is the time dependent unperturbed radius @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the unperturbed radius at @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , @xmath17 denotes the net interface perturbation with fourier amplitudes @xmath18 , and discrete azimuthal wave numbers @xmath19 . recall that our main goal is to find out what is the  ideal \" time - dependent injection rate @xmath0 for which interfacial perturbation amplitudes are as small as possible .",
    "this should be done by injecting a certain amount of the negligible viscosity fluid while keeping fixed initial [ @xmath20 and final [ @xmath21 radii , where @xmath22 is the final time .",

    "@xcite , this is not rigorously correct because @xmath41 evolves with time and , therefore , there is no such idea of single mode with maximum growth rate .",
    "nevertheless , this is a useful and fruitful way to picture what is happening , as unequivocally demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . the relative amplitude ( [ amplitude1 ] )",
    "is minimized whenever the integral inside the exponential is minimized .",
    "such variational problem can be solved by means the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "nonetheless , the equation of motion derived from the `` lagrangian '' @xmath42 is nonlinear and , therefore , difficult to be solved exactly . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that in many cases of experimental interest the capillary number is sufficiently large , so that @xmath43 and , therefore , it is acceptable to approximate the maximum growth rate ( [ lag2d ] ) by @xmath44 in which case the euler - lagrange equation yields a surprisingly simple differential equation @xmath45 , implying that @xmath13 and @xmath0 [ see eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ] are linear functions of time @xcite . however , it should be pointed out that there are other instances in which hele - shaw flows take place under considerably low capillary number circumstances ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the aim of the present section is to go further and obtain the function @xmath13 that minimizes the amplitude with maximum growth rate _ without _ assuming that the capillary number must be large .",
    "this amounts to solving a nonlinear differential equation . to accomplish this",

    "our job is to find the general solution for the nonlinear first order differential equation ( [ hamilteq ] ) .",
