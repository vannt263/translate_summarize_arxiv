    "a large research effort is presently devoted to the manipulation of an increasing number of quantum systems in order to use them as a possible support for quantum computation",
    ". in atomic physics , on the one side single trapped ions have lead to major steps toward large scale quantum hardware .",
    "the almost perfect control of trapped ions motional and electronic long lived states has enabled high fidelity single qubit operations @xcite , very efficient two qubit gates @xcite and recently the realization of the first quantum - bite @xcite . on the other side , cold atomic ensembles",
    "are also very attractive and have emerged as an alternative light - matter interface .",
    "quantum state transfer from an atomic cloud onto a photonic qubit has been demonstrated @xcite as well as the entanglement of two remote atomic ensembles @xcite .    in solid state physics , charged semiconductor quantum dots are also promising candidates to implement quantum computing protocols .",
    "a single trapped electron in a quantum dot has long lived spin states @xcite which in principle allow for long information storage times .",
    "very recently , the spin state of a single electron trapped in a self assembled quantum dot has been prepared with a fidelity close to unity @xcite .",
    "this initialization , prerequisite to any spin manipulation , is a major advance which can be seen as a laser - cooling mechanism implemented in a solid - state environment . in the experiments of attatre and coworkers , a weak magnetic field ( @xmath0 100 mt )",
    "was applied along the quantum dot growth direction ( faraday configuration ) such that the electron spin state becomes less sensitive to surrounding fluctuations . in many other works ,",
    "single charged quantum dots are also studied when a strong magnetic field ( @xmath0 5 - 10 t ) is applied perpendicular to the growth axis @xcite ( voigt configuration ) .",
    "the latter removes the degeneracy of the two spin projections along the field which are then the basis for subsequent manipulations . in the voigt configuration electron spin coherences",
    "have been measured @xcite while theoretical proposals have shown how optical control can be achieved @xcite .",
    "a trapped electron spin can be rotated in different ways , in general due to subtle fermion exchanges which can take place with virtual excitons coupled to unabsorbed photons @xcite . in quantum dots , when a strong magnetic field is applied in the voigt configuration , raman transitions have been proposed to perform arbitrary single qubit operations @xcite . using two",
    "crossed polarized and detuned laser pulses , the electron spin states can be virtually coupled to  trion \" states@xcite .",
    "the trapped electron spin can therefore be well manipulated , with a close to unity fidelity for typical operation times of 50 ps . a procedure to perform general spin rotations via stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) was also proposed @xcite , with a required auxiliary ground state , to perform single qubit operations and quantum gates in coupled quantum dots .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the spin state of a single charged quantum dot can also be completely controlled with a single laser frequency , with or without a weak magnetic field applied in the faraday configuration .",
    "the latter situation corresponds to experiments which have up to now provided remarkable results , furthermore , removing the degeneracy protects the qubit from spin flipping errors . using a single laser beam , of prepared elliptical polarization and tilted with respect to the quantum dot growth direction ,",
    "a coherent coupling between the two electron spin states is created .",
    "arbitrary rotations can thereby be obtained in few tens of picoseconds , with high fidelities for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "we derive the photon induced entanglement of the electron spin states through an effective hamiltonian describing the virtual transitions towards trion states .",
    "the mechanism is highlighted by the recently developed shiva diagrams for interacting composite bosons @xcite .",
    "our proposal is based on the semiconductor light - hole excitations . in a gaas quantum well",
    ", the latter have allowed the experimental demonstration of an induced electron spin coherence , in a waveguide geometry i.e. with an excitation laser propagating in the plane of the quantum well @xcite . in the experiments of sarkar et al .",
    ", a light - hole relaxation time of about 40 ps is deduced .",
    "this value at first seems to prohibit the use of light - holes for any electron spin manipulation .",
    "the same order of magnitude is indeed expected for self - assembled quantum dots ( to our best knowledge , in quantum dots no experimental values for the light - hole lifetime have been reported ) .",
    "however , we will demonstrate in the following that high - fidelity qubit gates can be achieved using light - holes . in the worst case scenario for which light - holes would have a lifetime of 50 ps in a quantum dot ,",
    "we show that arbitrary rotations of the electron spin already have at least 97@xmath1 fidelities with a gate time of few tens of picoseconds .    in strained quantum dots ,",
    "light - hole levels can become the lowest energy hole states @xcite .",
    "this suppresses most relaxation channels and yields long lived light - holes .",
    "assuming such a quantum dot , calarco and co - workers @xcite have proposed to use raman transitions between electron and light - hole states to perform single qubit rotations and two qubit gates . with two orthogonal laser fields , of linear and circular polarizations , the electron spin states can indeed be coherently coupled . in this work ,",
    "we show that the resulting complex two orthogonal axes geometry is in fact not required , a single laser beam of suitable elliptical polarization and propagation direction is sufficient . using a single",
    "beam provides more optical access for scattered light which improves photon detection efficiency .",
    "plane of a self - assembled quantum dot , at an angle @xmath2 with respect to the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the laser polarization @xmath4 is in general elliptical and has projection along @xmath5.,width=226 ]    as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , we consider an excitation laser which propagates in the ( oxz ) plane of a self - assembled quantum dot at an angle @xmath2 relative to the @xmath3 axis . in the most general situation , the laser field polarization has non vanishing projections along all directions , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the first two are used to couple light - hole levels to the two electronic levels via @xmath8 and @xmath9 optical transitions .",
    "the last projection also couples the light - hole levels to the electronic ones but via so called @xmath10 transitions maintaining the projection of the angular momentum along ( oz ) ( see figure [ fig2].a ) .",
    "consequently , a coherent coupling between the trapped electron states , with up and down spin projections along ( oz ) , can be induced .",
    "moreover , since semiconductors have a refraction index of the order of 3.5 , the angle can be @xmath11 .",
    "photon into a @xmath8 one .",
    "( b ) @xmath9 photons can also be obtained from @xmath10 ones while flipping the electron spin .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) : electron spin - flip obtained from the transformation of @xmath12 photons into @xmath10 ones . ]",
    "the carrier exchange between the trapped real electron and the virtual light - hole - electron pair , coupled to unabsorbed @xmath10 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 photons , allows to switch the trapped electron spin projection along ( oz ) ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this switch imposes the transformation of a @xmath10 photon into a @xmath13 or a @xmath14 one , or vice - versa , in order to conserve the total momentum of the system .",
    "note that , in these processes , the intermediate states are made of one real and one virtual electron with opposite spins , along with one virtual light - hole .",
    "the optical spin manipulation we propose then implies the formation of a semi virtual trion , in the same way as in ref @xcite .",
    "we consider unabsorbed photons with a detuning @xmath15 with respect to the electron - light - hole transition , i.e. with a frequency @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the electron and light - hole energies without applied magnetic field respectively . in self",
    "assembled quantum dots , the energy splitting between the heavy and the light - holes levels is typically of the order of tens of mev , while the energy splitting between the confined electronic levels can be made much larger for small dot structures @xcite .",
    "consequently , in the following we only consider couplings between the light - holes and the first confined electronic state , the laser photons being assumed far detuned with other electronic transitions .    in a quantum dot small compared to the exciton bohr radius ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is rather unimportant , the carrier energy being controlled by localization . in addition , as already shown on various examples@xcite , the optical non linearities are driven by pure carrier exchanges , due to a bare dimensionality argument , so that coulomb interaction between carriers is going to play a minor role in the problem investigated here .",
    "this is why coulomb interactions can be neglected in the dot hamiltonian reducing to @xmath19[eq2 ] @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) being fermionic operators for the destruction ( creation ) of a trapped electron or hole respectively .",
    "the semiconductor - laser - photons interaction is in general written as @xmath24=@xmath25+@xmath26 , where @xmath26=@xmath27+@xmath28+@xmath29 with @xmath30[eq3 ] the photon field is treated classically , with the definition @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the field vector potential , @xmath33 is the electron mass , and @xmath34 is the canonical momentum whose vector components are identical . restricting to the light - hole levels , we only consider couplings employing the @xmath35 operators",
    ".    the coupling @xmath24 does not conserve the number of carriers , the changes it induces to the degenerate zero , @xmath36 , and one electron states @xmath37 only appear at second order in this coupling . in order to derive the dynamics in the @xmath38 trapped electron states in the presence of pump photons , we express an effective hamiltonian , @xmath39 , to obtain proper equations of motion . in this approach , several constraints are imposed .",
    "apart from hermiticity , most importantly , @xmath39 must have the same eigenvalues as the original hamiltonian , @xmath40=@xmath41+@xmath24 , with the same degeneracy .",
    "@xmath39 is in fact obtained from an appropriate unitary transformation @xcite , and reads at second order in the coupling @xmath24 @xmath42 where the states @xmath43 correspond to any intermediate states and @xmath44 are initial and final ground states respectively .",
    "the dot - photon interaction induces an energy shift of the zero - electron state , @xmath36 .",
    "it is given by the matrix elements of @xmath39 in this degenerate subspace . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1]-[eq4 ] ) it is easy to show that this operator is diagonal , with @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the electron and light - hole energy shifts induced by the applied magnetic field .",
    "note that these are very small compared to @xmath15 for our parameter regime of interest .",
    "we remark that two channels exist for the coupling of @xmath10 photons with the dot electron - light - hole states , while there is only one channel for the circularly polarized photons .",
    "the different terms of eq.([eq5 ] ) are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    ".,width=340 ]      the modifications induced by the trapped electron - photon interaction contain two types of processes .",
    "spin projection along @xmath3.,width=291 ]    ( _ i _ ) in direct processes , the electron which recombines is the one of the virtual electron - hole pair coupled to the excitation photon . due to pauli exclusion",
    ", the electron of the virtual pair must however have a spin different from the one already present in the quantum dot .",
    "for an @xmath48 electron , we only have the two processes shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the energy change induced for these diagonal processes is @xmath49    ( _ ii _ ) exchange processes are also possible between the trapped electron and the virtual electron - light - hole pair coupled to photons .",
    "again , due to the pauli exclusion principle , the electron spin of this virtual pair must be different from the trapped one .",
    "an electron exchange between a virtual pair coupled to a @xmath10 photon and a @xmath50 electron leads to the diagram of figure [ fig3].a , while an electron exchange with a @xmath51 electron leads to the diagram of figure [ fig3].b . in this exchange ,",
    "the spin of the trapped electron flips while a @xmath10 photon is transformed into a circularly polarized photon.the reverse transformations being also allowed ( see figures [ fig3].c and [ fig3].d ) , these processes lead to the two non diagonal matrix elements @xmath52 the minus sign being due to the single carrier exchange involved in these interactions .",
    "therefore , we obtain in the computational basis @xmath53,@xmath54    @xmath55\\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath56=@xmath57@xmath58 , @xmath59=@xmath60@xmath61 and @xmath62=@xmath60@xmath63",
    ". please note that the time dependance of these rabi frequencies is implicitly considered .",
    "let us mention that in previous works @xcite a density matrix approach has been followed to describe stimulated raman transitions in quantum dots .",
    "one then considers the four following states : the two electronic levels with spin projections in the @xmath3 direction , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the two trion levels @xmath66 and @xmath67 made of an electron pair with opposite spins and a light hole with up and down spin projection along @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the level scheme and the different optical transition strengths are depicted in figure [ fig2].b .",
    "please note that to preserve proper anti - commutation relations between fermionic operators , the optical transitions have in this point of view different signs compared to the previous expressions .",
    "a model hamiltonian can thus be built in the @xmath68 , @xmath65 , @xmath67 , @xmath69 basis , and turning into the rotating frame , the equations of motion in the restricted @xmath70 , @xmath71 subspace are obtained after adiabatic elimination of the virtually populated trion levels .",
    "this procedure provides the proper effective hamiltonian in second order perturbation theory , but let us stress that care must be taken in order to correctly account for non degeneracy of the ground states .",
    "consider the geometry in fig . [ fig1 ] with the @xmath3 axis defined as the axis of symmetry of the quantum dot .",
    "the addressing laser propagates with a wavevector @xmath72 at an angle @xmath2 with respect to the @xmath3 axis in the @xmath73 plane .",
    "we choose an elliptical polarization of the electric field with respect to a primed coordinate frame @xmath74 given by @xmath75 .",
    "the field components in the spherical basis of the unprimed coordinate system of the dot are given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the reduced wigner rotation matrix for a spin-1/2 representation of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "single qubit gate performance as a function of field detuning @xmath15 .",
    "the system parameters are @xmath79 and three different field strengths are plotted : solid lines correspond to @xmath80 , dotted lines @xmath81 , and dashed lines @xmath82 .",
    "( a ) worst case fidelity for a single qubit operation .",
    "( b ) maximum gate time . ]    during single qubit gate operations , there will be decoherence induced by off resonant laser coupling to unstable trion states .",
    "we describe such decay processes by a phenomenological parameter @xmath83 .",
    "the effect of this decay on gate performance is captured by constructing an effective non hermitian hamiltonian @xmath84 from @xmath39 by the replacement @xmath85 .",
    "the dot - photon interaction can then be represented as a vector in the operator space spanned by the pauli operators . ignoring the component of the identity operator , we write @xmath86 . in the limit @xmath87",
    ", the real parts of the dimensionless coupling vectors are @xmath88 the system parameters , which are assumed fixed during gate operations , are @xmath89",
    ". the rabi frequency @xmath90 and @xmath83 is the parameter describing decay of the electron - light - hole pair .",
    "single qubit gates can be performed by using a sequence of laser pulses with varying polarization parameters @xmath91 .",
    "because these pulses share the same wavevector @xmath72 , they can be obtained from the same source and used in the same geometric configuration relative to the dot .",
    "the nature of the sequence follows from the canonical decomposition of any unitary @xmath92 : @xmath93 provided the bloch vectors are orthogonal : @xmath94 . expanding this generalized euler decomposition gives the following relations @xmath95 these equations can be inverted and without loss of generality we can choose @xmath96 .",
    "hence it is only required that for a fixed set of parameters @xmath97 , we find a pair of non zero vectors satisfying @xmath98",
    ".    the process fidelity can be quantified by the overlap of the target unitary @xmath99 with the implemented operator .",
    "we model the implemented operator as the non unitary evolution generated by three sequential evolutions by the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath100 acting on the joint electron - trion space : @xmath101 \\end{array}\\ ] ] hence we adopt the following measure of operator fidelity : @xmath102\\big| \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath103\\exp\\big[-it_2\\vec{h^r}(\\gamma_2,\\phi_2)\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}\\big]\\\\ & & \\times\\exp\\big[-it_1\\vec{h^r}(\\gamma_1,\\phi_1)\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}\\big ] . \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath104 is the projector onto the computational basis . in terms of the parameterization for @xmath99 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",

    "this corresponds to a gate time @xmath132 using fields detuned by @xmath133 from optical resonance .",
    "fidelities and gate times for generic single qubit unitaries are plotted in fig .",
    "we have proposed a simple way to experimentally implement arbitrary rotations with a single electron trapped in a quantum dot . as in many other works ,",
