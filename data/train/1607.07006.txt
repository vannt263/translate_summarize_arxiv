    "the field of autonomous uavs is still in its embryonic stage.the concept of advanced autonomous robotics is quite often depicted in science fiction movies and many of these are becoming a reality.these autonomous uavs can serve the purpose such as search and rescue , evacuations , intelligence gathering and other reconnaissance task without much human intervention.this paper focuses on those tasks which require visual detection for navigation such as ingress through rectangular window to enter into the building , landing and mapping tasks etc.a visual approach for detecting rectangular opening or window as a target in the surrounding has been proposed .",
    "+ highly power - intensive sensor suites are difficult to use on uavs for ingress task.these sensors should be light , small and capable enough to perform the required tasks.in this work , single front facing monocular camera has been used for detection . an optical flow sensor is also mounted in order to get local positions accurately .",
    "different approaches have been used for similar work . feature and pose constrained visual aided inertial navigation for computationally constrained aerial vehicles after detection of ingress target ( window or door)has been presented in this paper[1 ] , feature extraction and matching has been used for detection purposes.feature detection is implemented by star feature detectors.correspondence between detected frames are found using upright surf ( speeded up robust features ) .    stereo vision system for the visual feed and simultaneous localization and mapping ( slam )",
    "algorithm are also being used for the navigation purpose[2].both the ekf state estimates and incoming sensor measurements are used to create a global map of the surrounding .",
    "both the above approaches use two cameras and highly power intensive sensors .",
    "the work of r. brockers @xmath0[3 ] uses a single monocular camera to detect the navigation target in a known environment mapped using vicon .3d waypoints are being generated in the same frame for autonomous navigation .",
    "pose - based filtering [ 5 ] , referred to as vision aided inertial navigation ( vain ) , is in many respects similar to bundle adjustment .",
    "vain systems increases the accuracy of the filter state with current estimate of the camera position.it builds up a set of previous camera poses over time in order to get more accurate results .",
    "the complexity of filter is linear in the observed number of features which are stored among the past camera poses which are used to update the vehicle state .",
    "visual aided autonomous navigation in the gps - denied environment has also been explored .",
    "a vision - aided inertial navigation system that enables autonomous flight of an aerial vehicle in gps - denied environments has been discussed by allen d @xmath0 [ 6].feature point information from a monocular vision sensor is used to bound the drift resulting from integrating accelerations and angular rate measurements from an inertial measurement unit ( imu ) forward in time .",
    "an extended kalman filter framework is proposed for performing the tasks of vision - based mapping and navigation separately .",
    "blosch et al.[7 ] discuss the use of a monocular camera - based slam algorithm for accurate estimation of the pose of a uav in gps denied environments.a technique proposed by klein and murray[4 ] for augmented reality applications is used by blosch et al . to show the use of a slam algorithm for uav real - time application with sustained tracking using image keyframes .poses are generated externally for navigation task.this paper uses estimation of the relative poses for correcting the relative position of uav .",
    "target can be in any plane of the ned frame and the absolute yaw of the quadrotor is known from the attitude estimator in the ned frame.so , for getting the relative angle between the quadrotor(camera plane ) and the target plane , homographic estimation is used .",
    "these relative poses will be used in the navigation scheme .",
    "the task can be divided into different intermediate steps .these steps are described in details in this section .",
    "robust window detection is a major step which should be done perfectly in order to get the camera pose in the next step correctly.window detection step is further divided into the sub - steps which should all described below .",
    "standard canny edge detection algorithm is applied for getting the edges.some intermediate steps being inserted for more robust edge detection which includes removing small and broken edges , enhancing the target edges and normalization / equalization of histogram(normalization of distribution of intensities among pixels ) .",
    "steps for the noise removal :    * gaussian blurring * pyramid downscaling / up - scaling * equalizing histogram    first two steps are majorly for the blurring / smoothing the image as much as possible unless the window edges are affected because the edge detection is done using high pass filters and the signal part in the image should be lowered in order to get the edges correctly . without any noise removal",
    "the edge detection can be seen in figure.1(a).the effect of the noisy edge detection on the final window detection can be seen in the figure.2(a ) which is not satisfactory .",
    "+   +    0.2     0.23     intensity values corresponding to desired edges are carried by quite less number of pixels which must be increased for getting a better quality detection .",
    "histogram equalization technique is used to redistribute the intensities corresponding to detected edges which are our area of interest.the detected image after the noise removal steps is shown in the figure.1(b ) after detecting the desired edges in the image , everything else other than window should be filtered out.for this purpose , hough probabilistic transform[8 ] is used.each and every line in the image is represented in its r and @xmath1 form and by plotting the graph between these two quantities every point on that graph will represent a straight line(having corresponding r and @xmath1 value).by using a particular threshold votes ( minimum number of intersections on the r-@xmath1 curve ) every line is voted for its validity and by this method we can remove the lines other than window edges.other parameters like minimum gap between two lines which should be maintained for the independent existence of those two lines and maximum width for a line to pass the test are also obtained using threshold values.these threshold values are decided by using trackbars on the image.the output of this method can be seen in figure.2(b ) . after getting the output from the hough transform , holes ( less quality detection ) in any edge might lead to a unclosed contour.for this purpose , dilation operation is applied which actually increases the width of the edge so that the potential holes will be filled up .",
    "0.2     0.24     0.2     0.23       after getting the appropriate edges of the window , closed contours present in the image have to be detected and decided whether it can be the target window or not by applying some constraints .",
    "the vector of contours present in the image are selected and these are passed through an approximation step which generates a best fit approximated polynomial corresponding to that particular contour . after getting approximate polynomial corresponding to a contour , the potential polynomials having the most probable chances of being window should be extracted by applying different constraints and conditions.these constraints and conditions are described below .    * corners : * there should be four corners in the detected contours for it to be a window .",
    "* area : * area of the detected contour should be put in a certain range in order to remove the noisy contours.the min and max values of the threshold are decided according to the distance range within which uav has to achieve its initial waypoint .",
    "* aspect - ratio : * the ratio of the width of the contour to the its height is the aspect ratio which should also be in a reasonable range so that the most of the distorted quadrilateral should be eliminated .",
    "* hull area : * this is the area of the convex form of the contour detected.as the contour should be convex so this area should be almost equal to the contour area .",
    "* angle : * the angle between the edges should be almost 90 degrees as uav will be in a particular yaw range.the threshold value of the angle will be decided according the maximum absolute yaw uav will achieve in the task .    after getting the most potential contours ,",
    "green rectangle is drawn on the image corresponding to the detected contour and centroid of the rectangle has been calculated and also drawn as yellow dot at the calculated pixel coordinates in the image.the final window detection is shown in the figure.2(d ) .",
    "+      while detecting the target window there are always false positives present in the surroundings which also qualify all the conditions for being a window , but these are not our target window so all these false positives have to removed .",
    "histogram comparison[9 ] technique is applied to remove these false positives . in this method ,",
    "histogram of the reference image ( target window image)and the current image feed are compared to each other and bhattacharyya distance is calculated which is low if the two images are almost same ( if they have the same color composition ) and high if they are not.by setting a threshold value on this distance , all the contours can be extracted which have this distance measure less than the threshold and all the other contours will be removed . after removing the false detections and detecting the correct target window , the robust window detection is achieved .",
