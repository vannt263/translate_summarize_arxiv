    "* a transfer field in the range of @xmath116 ensures a maximum effective gain and a small total ion feedback .",
    "* since the combined gain of the gem and the microcat is limited and because the gem is easily destroyed by discharges the microcat should be operated at much higher gain than the gem .",
    "the maximum gas gain decreases with pressure and atomic number of the noble gas . a stable operation with gains in the order of @xmath117",
    "can be obtained even for xenon gas mixtures up to @xmath63 .",
    "the new optimised microcat structure is superior to all other microcat devices with respect to electron transparency .",
    "the ion feedback of the new mesh is smaller than for the mcat155 and nearly as good as for the old mcat215 structure .",
    "gas gains of larger than @xmath45 can be achieved in argon gas mixtures at standard pressure . + in our special detector setup a gem has been investigated with respect to its charge transfer and gas gain behaviour with different voltage settings and different gas environments .",
    "the charge transfer simulations are well confirmed by the measurements .",
    "a sub - division of the overall electron transparency into the two transparencies @xmath56 and @xmath57 is reasonable .",
    "the achieved gains of the gem are comparable to published results .",
    "+ the combination of both gas gain devices leads to a very high gas gain at atmospheric pressure and a reliable detector operation with gains in the order of @xmath117 in xenon gas mixtures at higher pressures of about @xmath63 .",
    "the gem can be operated in a very safe gas gain mode , whereas the the microcat produces the largest amount of gain ; due to the robustness of the nickel mesh and its insensitivity against sparking no destruction of this device needs to be feared .",
    "the fraction of back drifting ions is in the order of a few percent when microcat and gem are combined .",
    "therefore , spatial reconstruction distortions due to space charge effects in the conversion region are expected to be small .",

    "the optimised microcat mesh was possible .",
