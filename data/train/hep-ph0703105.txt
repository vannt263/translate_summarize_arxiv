    "the position of the probe brane sitting at certain point in the radial direction is proportional to the mass of the quark . since one expect that the presence of the probe brane would not affect the geometry in the leading order , it is necessary to put the probe brane far away from the branes which produce the gravitational background , and hence the large mass of the quark and antiquark . in the dual picture , there are two configurations which are competing with each other .",
