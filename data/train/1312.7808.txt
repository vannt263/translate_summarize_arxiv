    "recently released planck data favor highly gaussian primordial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "although this is in agreement with predictions of the slow roll inflation  @xcite , the picture of the early universe is still uncertain . in particular , there remains a window for scenarios with relatively strong non - linearities .",
    "one reason is that the existing constraints apply to specific types of non - gaussianity only ; other shapes of correlation functions require separate data analyses .",
    "second , one can imagine the situation where fairly large non - linear effects generated during some cosmological epoch get diluted at later times .",
    "we entertain both of these possibilities in this paper .",
    "it is well known that the shapes of inflationary bispectra are strongly sensitive to the regime of evolution of scalar perturbations at the time when the non - linearities are at work  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , it is assumed that perturbations start from vacuum initial conditions , get frozen out at some point and then remain unchanged until the hot era .",
    "one then classifies possible non - gaussianities as follows .",
    "if perturbations are superhorizon at the time when non - linearities are important , like in the curvaton  @xcite or modulated reheating scenario  @xcite , then the bispectrum is enhanced in the squeezed limit .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "the equilateral bispectrum is characteristic of non - gaussianities generated in the on - horizon regime  @xcite .",
    "there are also scenarios with inflaton fluctuations that start from unconventional ( non - bunch ",
    "davies ) initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , relevant is the evolution in the subhorizon regime at inflation , and the typical outcome is the oscillatory bispectrum enhanced in the flattened triangle limit .",
    "similar oscillatory bispectra originate also from the violation of the slow - roll conditions  @xcite or features in the inflaton potential  @xcite .",
    "it may happen that cosmological perturbations have more complicated history than in inflationary models .",

    "it is the assumed existence of the intermediate minkowskian stage that makes our scenario qualitatively different from others .",

    "not surprisingly , shapes of resulting bispectra are also similar to ones obtained in versions of inflationary scenario  @xcite . in our case , however , we expect qualitatively distinct shapes of non - gaussianities .",
    "an example of cosmology with the intermediate minowskian evolution of scalar perturbations is a version of conformal rolling scenario . in that scenario",
    "@xcite , one assumes that at early times , the space - time geometry is ( effectively ) minkowskian , and the theory possesses conformal symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by a field @xmath5 of non - zero conformal weight @xmath6 , which homogeneously rolls away from the conformal point , @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the conformal time , @xmath8 .",
    "one also assumes that there is another field @xmath9 of zero conformal weight . by conformal symmetry",
    ", the linear evolution of perturbations @xmath10 in the background @xmath11 is the same as that of massless scalar field in the de sitter space - time . and",
    "the result is the same : perturbations @xmath10 get frozen at late rolling stage and have flat power spectrum then .    at some point ,",
    "conformal symmetry becomes irrelevant , and @xmath12 settles down to some condensate value .",
    "after that , the field @xmath9 evolves as massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity",
    ". further behavior of its perturbations depends on the cosmological evolution at that time .",
    "generically , there are two sub - scenarios .",
    "one is that the modes of interest are already superhorizon in the conventional sense , and perturbations @xmath10 remain frozen until the hot era .",
    "non - linear effects in this sub - scenario have been considered in refs .",
    "the situation of our primary interest occurs in the second sub - scenario .",
    "it assumes that perturbations @xmath10 evolve non - trivially during long enough epoch between the end of conformal rolling and horizon exit  @xcite .",
    "the metric must be nearly minkowskian at this stage , otherwise the flat power spectrum generated at conformal rolling would be grossly modified .",
    "this second sub - scenario is realized , e.g. , if conformal rolling occurs and ends up early at the ekpyrotic contraction stage ; the nearly minkowskian evolution of perturbations @xmath10 takes place in that case from the end of conformal rolling almost to the bounce .",
    "as deviations from the minkowski metric become strong enough , perturbations @xmath10 leave the horizon , pass unaffected through the bounce and remain unchanged until the beginning of the hot era . at some time at the radiation dominated stage ,",
    "they convert into adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "we assume that the latter literally inherit properties of perturbations @xmath10 .",
    "hereafter , we prefer not stick to any particular early universe model and consider the general evolutionary picture of fig .  [ evolution ] .",
    "in addition , we assume that perturbations @xmath10 are massless and non - interacting during the intermediate minkowskian stage .",
    "in this situation , they are related in a simple way to the scale - invariant amplitude @xmath13 existing at the beginning of the intermediate stage @xmath4 , namely , when deviation from minkowski metric becomes strong .",
    "the fact that this is indeed so , at least in some cosmological scenarios , has been demonstrated in appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the free propagation of perturbations @xmath10 was considered in the universe filled with matter with the super - stiff equation of state , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , like in ekpyrotic models .",
    "it was shown that in the limit @xmath16 , the evolution of perturbations @xmath10 is effectively minkowskian all the way up to times @xmath17 , when perturbations @xmath10 are in the superhorizon regime . ] , @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the conformal momentum of a scalar mode , @xmath1 is the conformal time running from @xmath4 to the horizon exit @xmath3 . without loss of generality we set @xmath20 ,",
    "then after the horizon exit one has @xmath21 due to this relation , the form of the primordial bispectrum is related in a simple way to the initial shape function @xmath22 generated before the minkowskian evolution .",
    "it reads in terms of the primordial newtonian potential @xmath23 @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation @xmath23 , and we neglect the spectral tilt in what follows ; delta function stands for momentum conservation ; the normalization factor is chosen for future convenience .",
    "until section 3 we do not concretize the form of the shape function @xmath22 , considering it as an arbitrary slowly varying function of momenta .",
    "this is to show that effects due to the minkowskian evolution are fairly generic .",
    "the modification of the bispectrum due to the intermediate minkowskian stage shows up in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations .",
    "one effect is the suppression of the cmb bispectrum by the inverse duration squared of this stage .",
    "accordingly , the bispectrum vanishes as the duration of this stage tends to infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "the bispectrum can be of the observable size for sufficiently short minkowskian evolution .",
    "there is another interesting manifestation : the shape of the 3-point function undergoes oscillations in the multipole @xmath0 space .",
    "these are characterized by nearly constant amplitude in the range @xmath26 ( with the convention @xmath27 ; the bispectrum vanishes for @xmath28 ) , unlike in inflationary scenarios with non - bunch ",
    "davies initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "this makes us argue that known constraints derived from the planck data are not directly relevant to the case we study in the present paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we study the imprint of the bispectrum   on cmb .",
    "we give analytic calculations of the cmb bispectrum for the cases of sufficiently long and relatively short intermediate minkowskian stage .",
    "details of calculations can be found in appendices  a , b , c and d. in section 3 , we discuss the observability issues of the bispectrum with the planck data .",
    "we summarize our findings in section 4 .",
    "in the multipole representation , cmb temperature coefficients are defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the temperature fluctuation in the direction @xmath31 in the sky , and @xmath32 are spherical harmonics .",
    "coefficients @xmath33 are related to the primordial newtonian potential @xmath34 by @xmath35 where @xmath36 are standard cmb transfer functions , and @xmath37 is the present horizon radius ; @xmath38 is the direction of the momentum @xmath19 . recall that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the spherical bessel function .",
    "now , using eq .   and",
    "performing the integration over the third momentum @xmath41 , we obtain for the cmb bispectrum @xmath42 where the angles @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to directions of vectors @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . here",
    "we introduced notations @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the sake of concreteness , we assume the ordering @xmath51 in what follows . and one more comment is in order , before we dig into details of calculations .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is naturally large , since we are interested in the long minkowskian evolution , meaning that @xmath53 . leaving aside fine - tuning issues ,",
    "however , the parameter @xmath52 is allowed to be not exceedingly large , so we will also consider the case @xmath54 .",
    "going into even smaller values of @xmath52 is most likely not legitimate , as one may ruin the prediction for the scale - invariant power spectrum . on the observational side",

    "the contribution due to the first cosine in square brackets is always negligibly small .",
    "the reason is that this term rapidly oscillates for all relevant values of the parameter @xmath52 and cmb multipole numbers .",
    "similar story happens with the contributions due to the other three terms , except for small regions where oscillations are damped . for concreteness ,",
    "we pick the second cosine in the r.h.s . of eq .  .",

    ", we obtain @xmath68 one observes that oscillations are damped in the region @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the large dimensionless parameter @xmath71 thus , for calculating the integral  , the saddle point technique is naturally employed .",
    "depending on the duration of the intermediate stage , we distinguish two cases . for @xmath72 ,",
    "one keeps only the product of three rapidly oscillating cosines in eq .   when finding saddle points .",
    "for shorter duration of the intermediate stage , we should account for variations of spherical harmonics as well .",
    "conservatively , the two cases are separated at @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the largest multipole number , according to our conventions . in practice , the calculation neglecting the variation of the spherical harmonics can be extended down to @xmath75 ( recall that @xmath76 ) .",
    "let us argue for this .",
    "we first focus on the contribution due to the second term in eq .  .",
    "we are free to integrate first over angles @xmath77 and @xmath78 associated with the smallest multipole number @xmath79 . in that case , the spherical harmonic @xmath80 is not in the game .",
    "variation of the spherical harmonic @xmath81 for sufficiently small values of @xmath82 is estimated as @xmath83 .",
    "hence , the inequality @xmath84 holds in the region  , provided that @xmath52 is greater than @xmath79 .",
    "the estimate for the variation of the spherical harmonic with the largest multipole number reads @xmath85 .",
    "the second estimate here follows from the triangle relation @xmath86 .",
    "see also eqs .",
    "and   of appendix  a. we conclude that the variation of the spherical harmonic @xmath87 is also sufficiently small in the region   for @xmath52 larger than @xmath79 .",
    "this discussion is extrapolated to the contribution of the fourth cosine in eq .   in a straightforward manner . on the other hand , above argument",
    "does not work for the contribution of the third term there .",
    "however , it gives contribution negligible as compared to the other two in the case of the hierarchy between multipole numbers , @xmath88 .",
    "the reason is that the corresponding integral is saturated in the region @xmath89",
    "( i.e. , @xmath90 and vector @xmath65 anti - parallel to @xmath64 ) .",
    "the transfer functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 do not vanish only at @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "both the shape function @xmath95 and transfer function @xmath96 are suppressed for @xmath97 . also , the product of the three transfer functions is a rapidly oscillating function of variables @xmath98 .",

    "we check this explicitly in appendix b.    the correction to the bispectrum due to variations of shape and transfer functions @xmath95 and @xmath120 is given by @xmath129 since @xmath95 is a slowly varying function of its arguments , we estimate the corresponding term as @xmath130 .",

    "the 3-point function given by eq .   or eq",
    ".   has several peculiar features .",
    "our first observation concerns the behaviour of the bispectrum in the flattened triangle regime where @xmath146 ( recall our convention @xmath27 ) . for the sake of concreteness",

    ".   takes the form @xmath147   \\ ; .\\ ] ] borrowing results from the next section , we note that the first term here is suppressed due to the effective relation @xmath148 which holds in the flattened triangle regime modulo corrections of the order @xmath149 .",
    "partial cancellation occurs also in the second term .",
    "it is due to the relation @xmath150 which follows from the analogous relation between the @xmath124-symbols .",
    "thus , our bispectrum is suppressed by the factor @xmath151 , as compared to naive estimate , for configurations with @xmath146 .",
    "the bispectrum is suppressed also away from the flattened triangle limit , but for different reason .",
    "the source of this suppression is the integral over three transfer functions , i.e. @xmath152 we will perform the detailed analysis of this integral in section  3 . here",
    "let us make a qualitative observation .",
    "the integral over variables @xmath98 is saturated roughly at @xmath134 .",
    "somewhat loosely , we set arguments of transfer functions at @xmath79 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "then the bispectrum is roughly proportional to the product @xmath155 .",
    "the last factor here , @xmath156 , vanishes for @xmath157 and undergoes rapid oscillations as function of @xmath158 with the amplitude decaying away from the flattened triangle limit .",
    "numerical estimates of section 3 roughly agree with these expectations .",

    "the origin of oscillations can be traced back to oscillations in the cmb transfer functions relating the temperature fluctuation to the newtonian potential . normally , these oscillations are averaged out upon integrating over directions of momenta @xmath19 . in our case",
    "this does not happen because the bispectrum of scalar perturbations is saturated in the region where @xmath231 is almost parallel to @xmath232 .",

    "this tendency is indeed there , as is clearly seen from fig .",
    "unexpectedly , the opposite tendency is also present : there are cancellations occuring for configurations obeying flattened triangle relation .",
    "the interplay between the two tendencies is such that the amplitude gets smoothened , and we do not observe any preference of flattened over non - flattened configurations or vice versa .",
    "this feature is important for discriminating the models we discussed in this paper from inflationary scenarios , some of which predict the oscillatory behaviour of the bispectrum analogous to ours .",
    "for example , shapes somewhat similar to one in eq .",
    "are considered in refs .",
    "these are , however , characterized by the amplitude strongly peaked in the flattened triangle limit . *",
    "in the situation with the long intermediate stage , there is squeezing of the cmb bispectrum as compared to the case where the intermediate stage is absent .",
    "squeezing is particularly strong if the duration of the stage is smaller than the minimum multipole number @xmath79 .",
    "we also discussed the sensitivity of the planck experiment to the bispectrum predicted .",
    "we concluded that there is a window for the duration of the intermediate stage , though not particularly wide , where the non - gaussianity can be of the observable size .",
    "note that the signal of interest , if detected in the cmb data , would not imply the specific early universe model , but rather indicate the presence of the long minkowskian evolution before the hot era .",

    "<S> we consider a non - inflationary early universe scenario in which relevant scalar perturbations get frozen out at some point , but then are defrosted and follow a long nearly minkowskian evolution before the hot era . </S>",
    "<S> this intermediate stage leaves specific imprint on the cmb 3-point function , largely independent of details of microscopic physics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the cmb bispectrum undergoes oscillations in the multipole @xmath0 space with roughly constant amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is in contrast to the oscillatory bispectrum enhanced in the flattened triangle limit , as predicted by inflation with non - bunch  davies vacuum . given this and other peculiar features of the bispectrum , stringent constraints imposed by the planck data may not apply . </S>",
    "<S> the cmb 3-point function is suppressed by the inverse duration squared of the minkowskian evolution , but can be of observable size for relatively short intermediate minkowskian stage . </S>"
