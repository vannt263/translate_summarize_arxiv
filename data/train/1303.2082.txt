    "while the tools and ideas of conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite have become standard in low dimensional condensed matter physics , few of the fully solved , minimal unitary cfts have actually found realistic applications . out of the famous series with central charges given by  @xcite @xmath1 for instance",
    ", only the very few first values of @xmath2 correspond to experimentally ( or numerically ) observable critical points in statistical mechanics .",
    "this is because , as @xmath2 increases , more and more relevant operators are allowed @xcite which are not constrained by symmetries , requiring the un - realistic fine tuning of more and more parameters .",
    "the situation has been somewhat more favorable in the field of quantum impurity problems ( related to boundary conformal field theory  @xcite ) , where for instance a lot of results for the @xmath3 wzw theory have found applications in our understanding of the @xmath4-channel kondo problem  @xcite . yet , observing experimentally even the two - channel kondo problem remains difficult  @xcite .",
    "most physical applications of conformal invariance have involved instead cfts whose understanding is not complete .",
    "this includes two dimensional geometrical problems like self - avoiding walks and percolation , where the statistical properties of large , scaling objects are known @xcite to be described by critical exponents , correlation functions , _ etc .",
    "_ , pertaining to cfts with central charge @xmath5 .",
    "such theories are necessarily _ not unitary _ , since the only unitary cft with @xmath5 admits , as its unique observable , the identity field , with conformal weight @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "non - unitarity is certainly unpleasant from a field theoretic point of view : it corresponds roughly ( for more precise statements see below ) to dealing with ` hamiltonians ' that are not hermitian , and is probably non - sensical in the context of particle physics applications . in statistical mechanics",
    ", however , non - unitarity is rather common . in the case of polymers or percolation",
    ", it occurs because the basic problems one is interested in are non - local in nature  in percolation for instance , an important observable ( the order parameter ) is related with the probability that a cluster connects two points far apart , while wandering without limits through the system .",
    "this non - locality is easily traded for a local formulation which , however , involves complex boltzmann weights  @xcite . in the theory of",
    "self - avoiding walks for instance , one wants to cancel loops , which can be done by allowing elementary steps on the edges of a honeycomb lattice , and giving to each left / right turn a _ complex weight _ @xmath7 . since for a closed loop ,",
    "the number of left and right turns differ by 6 , summing over both orientations gives loops a fugacity @xmath8 as requested .",
    "other examples of complex boltzmann weights occur in the ising model in an imaginary magnetic field , where the yang - lee edge singularity describes critical points of hard objects with negative fugacity  @xcite .",
    "apart from geometrical problems , another situation where non - unitary cfts are crucial is the description of critical points in non - interacting @xmath9 dimensional disordered systems , such as the transition between plateaux in the integer quantum hall effect  @xcite ( see fig  [ aba : fig1 ] ) .",
    "there , transport properties after average over disorder can be expressed in terms of a two - dimensional sigma model  @xcite on a super - coset  @xcite of the type @xmath10 with topological angle @xmath11 .",
    "this sigma model is naturally non - unitary  a physical consequence of averaging over disorder ( which could also be done using replicas )  because of general supergroup properties ( see below ) .",
    "it is believed to flow to a strongly interacting cft with central charge @xmath5  @xcite , whose ( unknown ) exponents describe the plateau transition . another similar disordered problem of non - interacting fermions described by a lcft is given by the spin quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a subset of operators in this theory can be described in terms of a sigma model on a compact super - coset @xmath12 which is closely related to the classical percolation problem  @xcite .",
    "more generally , we note that there have been suggestions that the canonical formulation of quantum mechanics itself be relaxed to allow for non - hermitian , pt symmetric hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "such hamiltonians might , for instance , describe driven open systems , for which , once again , non - unitarity is natural .",
    "now , non - unitarity might be expected to be only a minor nuisance .",
    "after all , plenty of manageable ( rational ) non - unitary cfts are known , whose central charges are given by a formula generalizing ( [ cunit ] ) : @xmath13 for instance the case @xmath14 and @xmath15 describes the yang - lee singularity mentioned earlier  @xcite .",
    "the associated cft admits a negative central charge @xmath16 and a negative conformal weight @xmath17 . in terms of the virasoro algebra @xmath18=(n - m)l_{n+m}+{c\\over 12}(n^3-n)\\delta_{n+m}\\ ] ] this means that the quadratic form defined by @xmath19 is not positive definite .",
    "for instance , the state associated with the stress - energy tensor has a negative norm - square @xmath20 nevertheless , most properties of this theory can be handled like those for the unitary series  , the only difference being in some unphysical signs .",
    "it turns out however that for the cases of more direct physical interest the consequences of non - unitarity are considerably more important .",
    "first , many physically reasonable results stop working  an example of this is the failure of the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem for two dimensional models with continuous ( super ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "more technically maybe , giving up hermiticity means that hamiltonians or transfer matrices are not necessarily diagonalizable any longer . combining this feature with criticality in @xmath21 dimensions leads to the possibility of jordan cells for the dilatation operator @xmath22 , and therefore , to profound physical and mathematical modifications of conformal invariance , giving rise to what is called logarithmic conformal field theory ( lcft )  @xcite  a proverbially intricate subject , where progress has been slow for many years .",
    "things have improved recently , thanks in part to a rather down to earth , lattice approach ( combined with progress in the theory of associative algebras ) that we review here . to explain what happens ,",
    "we start by making a detour through representation theory of supergroups .",
    "the lie superalgebra @xmath23 is generated by two bosonic elements @xmath24 and two fermionic generators @xmath25 such that @xmath26 is central and the other generators obey @xmath27 \\ = \\",
    "\\pm \\psi^\\pm \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and } \\ \\ \\ \\       \\ { \\psi^-,\\psi^+\\ } \\ = \\ e.\\ ] ] the even subalgebra is thus given by @xmath28 .",
    "let us also fix the following casimir element @xmath29 @xmath30 the choice of @xmath29 is not unique since we could add any function of the central element @xmath26 .",
    "this has interesting consequences in field theory .",
    "finally we recall the definition of the supertrace @xmath31 .",
    "the superdimension is the supertrace of the identity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of bosons minus the number of fermions .",
    "the superdimension of @xmath23 is zero .",
    "the representation theory can be summarized quite easily ",
    "see @xcite for details and references .      to begin with , we list the irreducible representations which fall into two different series .",
    "there is one series of two - dimensional representations @xmath32 which is labeled by pairs @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in these representations ,",
    "the generators take the form @xmath36 and @xmath37 these representations are the typical representations ( long multiplets ) .",
    "in addition , there is one series of atypical representations @xmath38 ( short multiplets ) .",
    "these are 1-dimensional and parametrized by the value @xmath35 of @xmath39 .",
    "all other generators vanish .",
    "having seen all the irreducible representations @xmath32 and @xmath40 of @xmath23 , our next task is to compute tensor products of typical representations @xmath41 and @xmath42 using a basis @xmath43 . here , we emphasize that we deal with graded tensor products , that is , when we pass a fermionic operator through a fermionic state , we generate an additional minus sign .",
    "we will take the convention that @xmath44 is bosonic and @xmath45 is fermionic for the time being .",
    "it is of course possible to switch the @xmath46 grading and decide that @xmath44 is fermionic , _",
    "etc_. as long as @xmath47 , the tensor product is easily seen to decompose into a sum of two typicals , @xmath48 but when @xmath49 we obtain a 4-dimensional representation that can not be decomposed into a direct sum of smaller subrepresentations !",
    "the representation matrices of these 4-dimensional indecomposables @xmath50 read as follows ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) @xmath53 it is useful to picture the structure of indecomposables .",
    "the form of @xmath39 tells us that @xmath50 is composed from the atypical irreducibles @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . the action of @xmath25 relates these four representations as follows @xmath57 or , more explicitly , @xmath58_{\\psi^-}\\ar[dr]^{\\psi^+}&\\\\      & \\langle n-1\\rangle \\ar[dr]_{\\psi^+}&&\\langle n+1\\rangle \\ar[dl]^{\\psi^-}\\\\      & & \\langle n\\rangle &   } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we refer to the structure of indecomposable modules in terms of simple modules and mappings between them as subquotient structure .",
    "the casimir element @xmath29 in the representations @xmath59 maps the subspace @xmath38 on the top onto the @xmath38 on the bottom of the above diagram and is zero otherwise .",
    "this means that @xmath29 can not be diagonalized in @xmath59 .",
    "we shall return to this observation later on .",
    "imagine now building the wzw model with @xmath23 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "naturally , there will be primary fields @xmath61 associated with the typical representations @xmath32 , and their conjugates associated with @xmath62 .",
    "now the fact that the corresponding tensor product in @xmath23 is not fully reducible translates into a strange behavior of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , where the ` merging ' of the two representations on the right hand side of the tensor product translates into logarithmic terms  @xcite .",
    "the details of this logarithmic ope are not essential here  the point , rather , is the presence of the logarithm , justifying the name of logarithmic conformal field theory ( lcft ) .",
    "alternatively , observe that the sugawara stress tensor s zero mode @xmath63 has a rank - two jordan cell in the kac moody representations based on @xmath59 , and is not diagonalizable .",
    "this is the behavior characteristic of lcft , and is possible because @xmath22 is not hermitian .      while the initial example of the @xmath23 wzw theory  @xcite was perceived as a bit marginal , v.  gurarie pointed out soon after that indecomposability and logarithms are almost unavoidable at @xmath5 .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "based on general conformal invariance arguments , one can show that , whenever there is a single field with conformal weights @xmath64 , @xmath65 , the ope of a primary field with itself should take the form @xmath66 if one now imagines reaching @xmath5 through a limit process within a family of cfts  for instance by taking the @xmath67 limit of the @xmath68 model for self - avoiding walks , or by calculating the average free energy of a disordered system in a replica approach  there will occur a @xmath5 ` catastrophe ' @xcite because of the vanishing denominator . in general",
    ", this is not acceptable ( although the issue is a little subtle ) , so the divergence must be canceled by another term coming from a field whose dimensions are not those of the stress tensor generically , but become @xmath69 right at @xmath5 .",
    "the ope then reads @xmath70+\\ldots\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is called the logarithmic partner of @xmath72 .",
    "one can also show that @xmath22 then has a jordan cell of rank two , and @xmath73 together with @xmath74 note that @xmath75 is a null state , but it is not decoupled .",
    "note also that the equations involve a parameter @xmath0 ( called logarithmic coupling ) whose value is _ a priori _ undetermined .",
    "finally , note that @xmath76 is not a true scaling field , since it ` mixes ' with @xmath75 under a scale transformation .",
    "but it is important to stress that the logarithm occurs right at the fixed point of the renormalization group : this is very different from logarithmic corrections that may appear in models with marginally irrelevant operators , such as the xy model at the kosterlitz - thouless point  @xcite . for more details on the transformation rules of @xmath72 and @xmath71 ,",
    "see the reviews  @xcite .    an important question that arises when comparing this section and the previous one is the existence of ` hidden ' symmetries in @xmath5 theories explaining the degeneracy at conformal weight @xmath64 necessary to cure the @xmath5 catastrophe .",
    "this is discussed in j. cardy s review in this volume ( from the point of view of replicas )  @xcite , and below using our lattice approach in section  [ sec : fusion ] .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the spectacular progress in our understanding of ordinary cfts occurred largely due to a better understanding of the representation theory of the virasoro algebra .",
    "the decoupling of zero norm states of given conformal weight in particular leads to the kac table of ( not necessarily unitary ) models ( [ genc ] ) , differential equations for the correlators of the corresponding primary fields , _ etc_. in the case of lcfts however - such as those at @xmath5 describing polymers and percolation - decoupling such states voids the theory of most or all its physical content , and they must absolutely be kept .",
    "the problem is that there are then very few tools left to constrain a priori the content of the lcft .",
    "the general approaches which were so successful in the case of ordinary cfts simply lead nowhere , and despite years of effort and many interesting partial results ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , very little solid information about even the simplest physically relevant lcfts was available .",
    "one avenue for recent progress has been to try to gain knowledge about the algebraic features of the continuum limit by studying those of lattice regularizations .",
    "this seems a priori a bit hopeless , as precisely much of the power of cft has come originally from the fact that it deals directly with the continuum theory , where more , infinite dimensional symmetries are available .",
    "however , as time went on , it was realized that most of the power of cfts arose from algebraic structures that were present also  albeit in some finite - dimensional form  on the lattice , such as quantum groups  @xcite and their centralizers  @xcite .",
    "note that quantum groups naturally arise in cft  @xcite as well and might be very useful in getting some information on lcfts  @xcite ( see also the article  @xcite of a.  semikhatov and i.  tipunin in this volume ) .",
    "hence , trying to apply this lesson to understand lcfts is in fact not so counterintuitive .",
    "another reason for trying to be as concrete as possible is that the landscape of lcfts seems unbelievably complicated to say the least : it is not enough to build ` one ' consistent lcft at @xmath5 to solve the problem  there is most likely an infinity of such theories , and a lot of additional information must be provided to ensure correct identification .",
    "as we discussed briefly in the introduction , we are especially interested in lcfts which are fixed points of interacting , non - unitary , field theories with well defined local actions , such as the super - projective sigma models at topological angle @xmath11 , _",
    "etc_. if such lcfts exist , it is reasonable to expect that they must also admit some lattice regularizations with local degrees of freedom , that is , that their properties can be studied by considering models defined on large , but finite , lattices , and exploring their continuum or scaling limits . the point is to look , now , at _ finite - dimensional _ algebras describing the dynamics in such finite - lattice models , which are typically quantum spin - chains with _ local _ interaction . for most of the physically relevant cases",
    "these algebras are the temperley ",
    "lieb algebras and its boundary extensions which will be defined below .",
    "it is important that the representation theory of these algebras ( representations , fusion , etc ) is well under control .",
    "the hope beyond the lattice approach  which , as we will see , is warranted by experience ",
    "is that one can study all physically relevant indecomposable virasoro modules and their fusion rules ( and probably more ) by simply defining them as scaling limits of spin - chains modules .    before we describe our lattice regularization approach in details ,",
    "let us also mention other related works that also use lattice models in order to probe the complicated structure of lcfts . whereas our analysis focuses mainly on quantum spin chains , it is also interesting to study thoroughly loop models that provide indecomposable representations of the temperley - lieb algebra  @xcite .",
    "see also the contribution from morin - duchesne and saint - aubin in this special issue  @xcite .",
    "another lattice approach , with a special emphasis on fusion , was developed by pearce , rasmussen and zuber in  @xcite and pushed further in _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "in this preliminary section , we begin by introducing the `` simplest '' lattice models relevant for physics .",
    "we will mostly focus on the @xmath77-invariant open xxz spin chain  @xcite but we also describe how supersymmetric spin chains can be dealt with in the same way .",
    "we show how this relates to representations of the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra ( see  @xcite for recent reviews , and the book  @xcite for crucial pioneer work ) , for which we provide a short review of the representation theory .",
    "the simplest class of lattice models that we will study throughout this paper provides representations of the so - called temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra @xmath78 defined on @xmath39 sites .",
    "it is generated by @xmath79 s , with @xmath80 , and has the defining relations & = & 0 , |i - j | 2 , [ tldef ] + e_i ^2 & = & ne_i , + e_i e_i 1 e_i & = & e_i,[tldef - e ] with , and @xmath81 is a parameter which can in general take any complex value , but all physically interesting cases require @xmath81 to be a root of unity . in particular , dense polymers correspond to @xmath82 and percolation corresponds to @xmath83 .",

    "there are actually two crucial steps to measure indecomposability parameters on the lattice : identifying a lattice inner product that will go to the virasoro bilinear form in the limit , and , as mentioned above , properly normalizing the null state @xmath262 on the lattice .",

    "let us also briefly mention that the temperley - lieb algebra is not the end of the story .",
    "of course , there are many other lattice algebras that one can use to construct statistical models described by conformal field theory .",

    "as for the temperley - lieb algebra , one can define standard modules @xmath280 and @xmath281 that are still parametrized by the number of through - lines @xmath282 , but there are also two sectors _ blobbed _ and _ unblobbed _ corresponding to the two projectors @xmath0 and @xmath283 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to define critical lattice models based on this blob algebra , and one finds that whereas the tl standard modules were related in the scaling limit to kac modules over the virasoro algebra , the blob standard modules tend to verma modules  @xcite .",
    "the blob algebra is clearly larger than tl and so are its representations , since they correspond in the limit to verma modules without any quotient being taken . as a consequence ,",
    "the blob algebra representation theory is much richer  @xcite , and standard modules have a complicated indecomposable structure in non - generic cases ( see fig .  [ aba : figverma ] for an example taken from  @xcite , where @xmath284 are simple modules of the blob algebra ) .",

    "just like we did on the lattice , one can introduce a new field @xmath71 for generic central charge as @xmath358 where @xmath359 , @xmath360 and @xmath361 .",
    "the ope   has then a finite limit @xmath362 + \\dots,\\ ] ] with @xmath363 .",
    "of course , one can also compute correlation functions of @xmath364 to check that it indeed corresponds to the logarithmic partner of @xmath72 .",
    "this is just one example of a lattice fusion rule , in good agreement with what is expected on the field theory side . using the bimodule structure of the spin chains and algebra involving quantum group results , it is actually possible to obtain rigorous , general results for the lattice fusion of most of temperley - lieb modules  @xcite for all roots of unity @xmath81 .",
    "the physical consequences for the opes were also discussed in  @xcite .",
    "while the case of boundary lcfts is thus slowly getting under control , the understanding of the _ bulk _ case remains in its infancy . the main problem here , from the continuum point of view , is the expected double indecomposability of the modules over the product of the left and right virasoro algebras , leading to potentially very complicated modules which have proven too hard to study so far , except in some special cases .",
    "these include bulk logarithmic theories  @xcite with @xmath288-algebra symmetries  @xcite , and wzw models on supergroups which , albeit very simple as far as lcfts go , provide interesting lessons on the coupling of left and right sectors  @xcite .",
    "from the lattice point of view , the necessarily periodic geometry of the model leads to more complicated algebras  @xcite , like affine or periodically extended tl algebras , and to a more intricate role of the quantum group  @xcite , whose symmetry is partly lost . while it is possible to define and study lattice models whose continuum limit is a ( bulk ) lcft ,",
    "the underlying structures are also very difficult to get : the lattice algebras have a much more complicated representation theory .",
    "nevertheless , it looks possible to generalize the approach discussed above in the context of boundary spin - chains , partly to make progress in abstract representation theory of the periodic lattice algebras  @xcite and to obtain some results on their full symmetry algebras  @xcite .    at least in free fermion cases ,",
    "the lattice analysis given in  @xcite shows how one can straightforwardly proceed from the periodic temperley ",
    "lieb ( ptl ) generators to get virasoro modes in the bulk lcft of symplectic fermions : the combinations @xmath365 , \\qquad q={\\mbox{\\footnotesize$\\displaystyle\\frac{2n\\pi}{n}$}},\\ ] ] of the ptl generators @xmath199 converge in the scaling limit as @xmath224 to the well - known symplectic fermions representation of the left and right virasoro generators @xmath366 where the limit is taken for finite @xmath188 .    in general , while we expect to be able to extract the stress - energy tensor modes , @xmath200 and @xmath367 , from the periodic temperley ",
    "lieb algebras  @xcite , the interesting point is that the scaling limit of elements in the periodic tl can lead to other physical observables corresponding to different bulk scaling fields .",
    "a very important example of such a field is the energy operator in the potts model , associated with the staggered sum @xmath368 where the integral is taken over the circumference of a cylinder at constant imaginary - time @xmath369 .",
    "the field in   is the non - chiral degenerate field with conformal weights @xmath370 .",
    "of course , the introduction of such fields in the organizing algebra of a lcft requires discussion of objects which mix chiral and anti - chiral sectors .",
    "this leads us to the new concept of _ interchiral algebra _  @xcite .    for periodic @xmath23 spin - chains or free fermion points of xxz models with some twists ,",
    "an exhaustive analysis was done in  @xcite where the structure and role of the interchiral algebra in the case of the bulk symplectic fermions was also discussed in details .",
    "the idea there was to consider also limits with @xmath188 close to @xmath179 ( the dispersion relation of our hamiltonian has low - energy part close to zero as well as to @xmath371 momenta ) .",
    "it turns out that this limit gives the modes of a field @xmath372 ( of conformal dimension @xmath373 ) which is expressed in terms of derivatives of the symplectic fermions @xmath374 as @xmath375 where we use the symmetric form @xmath376 remarkably , this additional field generates the full scaling limit of the ptl algebras ( represented in the @xmath377 spin chains ) and this limit is our interchiral algebra @xmath378 .",
    "this statement was actually proven  @xcite using an interesting connection with symplectic lie algebras @xmath379 ( a howe duality ) and their rigorous direct limit @xmath380 .",
    "in particular , on the finite lattice with @xmath39 sites the ptl simple modules are just fundamental representations of @xmath379 , in the limit simple modules over @xmath378 are identified with appropriate simple @xmath380-modules .",
    "to this point we have extensively exposed ideas and tools that are proper to two dimensions . however , the fundamental mechanism for producing jordan cells of the dilatation operator remains operative in higher dimensions , @xmath381 , provided that two ( or more ) suitably related operators possess coinciding scaling dimensions .",
    "the algebraic tools that would permit to compute the ensuing logarithmic structure directly within such an lcft are however missing . instead , insight can be gained by accessing that theory as a limit , by tuning a suitable continuous ( or formally continuous ) parameter .",
    "this point of view is discussed in the contribution of cardy @xcite to this special issue .",
    "several situations of this kind are of direct physical relevance :    1 .",
    "disordered systems described by @xmath39-fold replication , in the replica limit @xmath382 @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the o(@xmath188 ) model , in the limit @xmath383 a non - positive integer ( including the polymer limit @xmath384 ) @xcite ; 3 .   the @xmath385-state potts model , in the limit @xmath386 a non - negative integer ( including the bond - percolation limit @xmath387 ) @xcite .    in all cases",
    "the key assumption is that physical operators can be fully described as irreducibles of the corresponding symmetry group ( @xmath388 , o(@xmath188 ) or @xmath389 , as the case may be ) .",
    "obviously , this approach will fail to give exhaustive results if the actual symmetry turns out to be larger ( e.g. , when specializing the results for the potts model in general dimension to @xmath390 ) .",
    "this line of research has been pushed the furthest for the potts model @xcite and we briefly review some of the results obtained .    the starting point is to define @xmath389 symmetric tensors of rank @xmath391 acting on @xmath39 lattice spins , subject to the constraints that 1 ) the tensor vanishes unless all @xmath39 spins are distinct and 2 ) the sum over any of the @xmath4 tensor indices is zero . for @xmath392",
    "this obviously produces @xmath393 which is just the potts order parameter ( magnetization operator ) . for @xmath394",
    "one finds @xcite    [ eqpott2spin ] @xmath395    the poles at @xmath396 are indicative of special behavior at this integers .",
    "more generally , one can construct such tensors for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath39 , in which case poles are found at all non - negative integers @xmath385 @xcite .",
    "we focus henceforth on percolation ( @xmath387 ) in the bulk .",
    "a well - defined limit is obtained by mixing @xmath397 with @xmath26 .",
    "the energy operator is given by @xmath398 , where we have taken the scaling limit with @xmath399 .",
    "for generic ( real ) @xmath385 one has @xmath400 where @xmath401 is a regular function of @xmath385 , with a finite non - zero limit @xmath402 for @xmath387 .",
    "the factor @xmath403 follows from the general result @xcite that correlation functions containing only energy operators vanish in bulk percolation .",
    "the tensor structure of two - point functions of arbitrary tensors can be deduced by combinatorial means @xcite . in particular",
    "one has @xcite @xmath404 where @xmath405 is again a regular function of @xmath385 when @xmath406 .",
    "moreover , for the maximum rank @xmath407 the two - point function is proportional to the probability of having @xmath39 distinct clusters propagating between the insertion points @xmath229 and @xmath408 @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath409 is the scaling dimension of the 2-cluster operator .    since @xmath409 and @xmath410",
    "collide for @xmath387 in any dimension @xmath411 @xcite , it is possible for the operators @xmath412 and @xmath413 to mix and form a jordan cell .",
    "moreover , they _ must _ do so in order to cure the divergence manifest in the last term of ( [ eqtwopointpsihat ] ) .",
    "the appropriate mixed operator is @xmath414 , with @xmath415 , and its two - point function is non - singular in the @xmath387 limit provided that @xmath416 : @xmath417 \\,.\\ ] ] the constant @xmath418 is universal , but obviously can not be computed exactly for @xmath419 due to our ignorance about the scaling dimensions . for @xmath390",
    "one finds @xmath420 .",
    "the logarithmic behavior can be isolated by constructing an appropriate geometrical observable @xcite . for @xmath421 ,",
    "let @xmath422 be the probability that @xmath4 distinct clusters join the group of two spins at point @xmath229 to the group of two spins at point @xmath408 ; and let @xmath423 denote the probability that the two spins within a group are distinct .",
    "then the combination @xmath424 isolates a pure logarithmic scaling ( i.e. , not multiplied by any power law ) which is observable in numerical simulations . for instance , one finds @xmath425 in @xmath390 @xcite , which compares favorably to the exact result @xmath426 .",
    "note also that the logarithm has its root in the _ disconnected _ correlation function @xmath427 ; this is true more generally @xcite .",
    "going beyond this specific example , the whole logarithmic structure of two- and three - point correlation functions in @xmath381 can be systematically unearthed by constructing the @xmath389 irreducible tensors acting on @xmath39 potts spins @xcite . in some sense",
    ", this extends to the realm of lcft polyakov s well - known classification of two- and three - point functions in @xmath428 dimensions , obtained in his case by using only global conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "by this direct lattice approach , lcfts of physical interest are slowly getting under control .",
    "the basic relationship between the virasoro and the temperley lieb algebra remains however , ill understood  although it is clear it has to do with centralizers  @xcite .",
    "while associative algebras provide a natural way to understand and classify virasoro modules , it is likely that the analysis can be carried out directly at the level of virasoro  an infinite dimensional lie algebra  provided more mathematical tools are developed .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the relationship with physics is growing .",
    "apart from the statistical mechanics problems already mentioned , the sigma models appearing on the ads side of the ads / cft correspondence , for instance , are close cousins of the supergroup sigma models discussed here .",
    "there has also been interest recently in studying what occurs ` beyond the topological sector ' in sigma models and yang mills theories  @xcite , _",
    "etc_. we should also mention that besides concrete physical applications , lcfts attracted recently considerable interest in the mathematics community  @xcite as well . in particular , the existence and uniqueness of logarithmic opes ( including the associativity condition ) were actually stated , as a theorem , in the fundamental series of papers  @xcite ( see also the review of huang and lepowsky in this volume ) , many rigorous results on @xmath288-algebras are given in  @xcite , _ etc_.    among the remaining challenges , the understanding of bulk lcfts is of utmost interest . in the lattice approach ,",
    "bulk lcfts are tackled by considering periodic spin chains . because of the ` loops ' then going around the space direction , the corresponding algebras are considerably more complicated ",
    "see  @xcite for details .",
    "the spectrum of conformal weights is then extremely rich , in particular , the conformal weights can not be arranged in a finite number of families where weights differ from each other by integers .",
    "although the conformal weights are all rational , the theory is therefore _ not rational _  @xcite .",
    "the full analysis of the bulk percolation lcft will be described in details in  @xcite , one of the main results being that the hamiltonian operator @xmath429 admits jordan cells of arbitrarily large rank as the corresponding conformal weight is increased .",
