    "ever since the pioneering work of hamber and parisi@xcite and of weingarten@xcite , the calculation of the light hadron spectrum has been regarded as a fundamental subject in lattice qcd .",
    "the extensive simulations on the gf11 computer@xcite have established that the quenched spectrum agrees with experiment within 510% .",
    "the next , and final , step within quenched qcd would be to further advance the calculational accuracy so that possible deviations from the experimental spectrum are made manifest . in this article",
    "we report the main results recently obtained with the cp - pacs computer towards this goal .",
    "our calculation is made with the plaquette gluon action and the wilson quark action .",
    "we employ a spatial size of @xmath0  fm to avoid finite - size effects , and @xmath1  gev to facilitate the continuum extrapolation . these requirements lead to the selection of @xmath2 and lattice sizes listed in table  [ tab : parameter ] .",
    "gauge configurations are generated with the over - relaxation and heat bath algorithms mixed in a 4:1 ratio .",
    "hadron propagators are calculated for the five quark masses corresponding to @xmath3 , 0.7 , 0.6 , 0.5 and 0.4 , the last point being a step closer to the chiral limit than hitherto attempted .",
    "all unequal quark mass combinations allowed for degenerate @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks are taken .",
    "we smear the quark source with the function @xmath6 $ ] , with @xmath7  fm .",
    "hadron masses are extracted by uncorrelated fits together with a single elimination jackknife procedure for estimating errors .",
    ".parameters of simulation . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : parameter ]    = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm",
    "we find @xmath8 for pseudoscalar and @xmath9 for vector mesons to be well described by a linear function of @xmath10 , which we adopt for our chiral fits .",
    "the physical point for the degenerate @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks is fixed by @xmath11(135 ) and @xmath12(769 ) , and we use @xmath13(498 ) or @xmath14(1019 ) for the @xmath15 quark .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mesone ] we show the continuum extrapolation of strange vector meson masses with the @xmath13 as input .",
    "a linear fit in @xmath16 yields the continuum value which is smaller than the experimental value by 3% for @xmath17 and by 4% for @xmath18 , to be compared with the statistical error of 0.5% .",
    "if we take @xmath19 as the input for the @xmath15 quark , @xmath20 agrees with experiment to 0.6% , while @xmath13 is higher by 9% .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy can be traced to the hyperfine splitting shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyperfine ] .",
    "our results , which scale well , decrease too fast as meson mass increases .",
    "the slope @xmath21 of the curve is related to the @xmath22 parameter through @xmath23 .",
    "a fast decrease translates into a small value of @xmath22 ; we obtain @xmath24 in the continuum limit .",

    "we show our typical chiral extrapolation for baryon masses in fig .  [",
    "fig : baryonc ] .",
    "we find all baryon masses to be linear in @xmath10 except for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which show a clear negative curvature .",
    "we choose a fit cubic in @xmath10 for @xmath25 , quadratic for @xmath26 , and linear for the other baryon masses .",
    "the negative curvature significantly lowers the nucleon mass compared to previous results at a finite lattice spacing , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : baryone ] . the continuum value obtained from a linear extrapolation is smaller than experiment by 2.3% , albeit consistent within the statistical error of 3% .",
    "the mass of @xmath27 is 6% higher , with a statistical significance of 1.7 standard deviations .",
    "the nucleon mass at each @xmath2 depends on the form adopted for the chiral extrapolation . including the form from quenched chiral perturbation theory , the continuum values , however , agree within 3% .",
    "the extraction of the continuum value is most uncertain for the nucleon , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 masses , for which the errors in the continuum limit are about 3% .",
    "for all the other channels a linear chiral extrapolation ( quadratic for @xmath26 ) followed by a linear continuum extrapolation fits our data very well , resulting in errors of 12% .",
    "= 7.5 cm    our final result for the baryon spectrum is shown in fig .  [",

    "the strange baryon masses are lower than experiment , by 58% using @xmath13 as input , and by 35% for @xmath19 as input .",
    "the gell - mann - okubo ( gmo ) relation , however , is well satisfied , at 1% for both cases .    for the decuplet the gmo relation takes the form of an equal spacing rule .",
    "this is also well satisfied with our results , the three spacings mutually agreeing within 510% .",
    "the average spacings , however , are too small by 30% with @xmath13 as input and by 20% for @xmath19 as input .",
    "the agreement of the baryon spectrum with experiment is generally better if we use @xmath19 as input , particularly for the decuplet .",
    "however , we have to remember that the @xmath29 meson mass differs from experiment by 9% in this case , which is a 7 standard deviation effect .",
    "we calculate light quark masses with the perturbative definition @xmath30 and with those based on the axial ward identity @xmath31 .",
    "the two methods give results considerably different at finite lattice spacings .",
    "however , extrapolated linearly in the lattice spacing , they converge to a common value within 5% as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mud ] . for average @xmath4,@xmath5 quark mass at 2  gev in the @xmath32 scheme , we obtain @xmath33  mev . for the @xmath15 quark mass , we find @xmath34mev and 111(4)mev using @xmath19 and @xmath13 .",
    "the discrepancy reflects the quenching error in the strange meson spectrum .",
    "we estimate @xmath35 using @xmath36 and @xmath37 including the 3-loop correction in the @xmath38 parameter and the scale determined from @xmath12 .",
    "the couplings are estimated from the average plaquette with 2-loop perturbation theory .",
    "a linear continuum extrapolation of the two results converge and yields @xmath39  mev where the error includes extrapolation uncertainties ."
