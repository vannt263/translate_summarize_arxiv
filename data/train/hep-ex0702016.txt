    "in late 1988 the italian institute for nuclear physics , infn , decided to construct an  collider meant to operate around 1020 mev , the mass of the -meson .",
    "the -meson decays mostly to kaons , neutral and charged , in pairs .",
    "the  production cross section peaks at about 3 @xmath1barns .",
    "-mesons decay 49% of the time into pairs and 34% of the time into pairs .",
    "even with a modest luminosity , =100 @xmath1b / s , hundreds of kaon pairs are produced per second .",
    "this collider , called a  and christened , is located at the laboratori nazionali di frascati , lnf , infn s high energy physics laboratory near rome @xcite .    [ [ section ] ]    the  layout",
    "is shown in fig . .",
    "the heart of the collider are two storage `` rings '' in which 120 bunches of electrons and positrons are stored .",
    "each bunch collides with its counterpart once per turn , minimizing the perturbation of each beam on the other .",
    "electrons and positrons are injected in the rings at final energy , 510 mev .",
    "electrons are accelerated to final energy in the linac , accumulated and cooled in the accumulator and transferred to a single bunch in the ring .",
    "positrons require first accelerating electrons to about 250 mev to an intermediate station in the linac , where positrons are created .",
    "the positrons then follow the same processing as electrons .    ; the  complex.;since the stored beam intensities decay rapidly in time , the cycle is repeated several times per hour .",
    "a collider is characterized by its luminosity   defined by : event rate = cross section , beam lifetime and beam induced radiation background .",
    "the latter is large for short lifetimes , which also result in the average luminosity being smaller than the peak value , in a word , lower event yield and large , variable background .",
    "is housed in the adone building at lnf , see fig . .",
    "infn soon realized that a state - of - the - art detector was needed to collect data at , from which physics results would materialize .",
    "thus a couple of years later , in summer 1991 , the kloe collaboration was initiated , though it was not formally approved nor fully funded for another couple of years , because the authorities had not envisioned fully the magnitude of . by late 1998 however ,  was designed , constructed , completely tested , and the humongous kloe detector , complete with all of its electronics for signal processing , event gathering and transmission , was moved from its own specially built assembly hall onto the newly commissioned  s south interaction region .",
    "in the subsequent seven years kloe , after beginning with a trickle of beam , by 2006 , had produced data of such precision that the kaon , the first fundamental particle to introduce the concept of  flavor \" into our current way of thinking , got its definitive 21st century portrait re - mapped with high precision , 60 years after its discovery .    the kloe saga , with its concomitant joys and travails ,",
    "would be an entertaining tale that should be written up somewhere .",
    "our purpose in this paper , instead , is to give the non - specialist reader a``flavor '' of the kloe experiment , in order to better appreciate the role that a complete experiment such as kloe plays in pushing forward the physics frontier .",
    "the kloe detector has a giant inner core , approximately 125 meters cubed , see fig . , and was built in frascati in the kloe assembly building , see fig . .",
    "it is on the same scale and complexity as the `` general purpose detectors '' of its time that were operating at the world s foremost laboratories such as lep at cern .",
    "if we consider that lep operated at about one hundred times s energy , producing much more energetic particles and with correspondingly greater multiplicities , s large size would seem unwarranted .",
    "we shall see however that while kloe s complexity was necessitated by its intent of being a definitive high precision experiment , its size , instead , was dictated by the quirk of one of the two neutral kaons , called the , of living an extraordinarily long time ( for short lived particles ) , about 51 nanoseconds .",
    "kaons from -mesons decaying at rest travel at approximately one fifth of the speed of light .",
    "this low speed is a great bonus for many reasons .",
    "however the mean path travelled by a -meson , @xmath2 is 3.48 m. thus if we want a detector which can catch @xmath3=63% of all decaying neutral long - lived kaons , it must have a radius of some three and a half meters .",
    "we compromise on two meters and catch some 40% of those decays .",
    "less than that in fact , since some volume is inevitably lost around the the beam interaction point , ip , and some more is lost at the outer edge , in order to be able to recognize the nature of the decays close to it .      catching a decay",
    "really means observing the decay products or particles .",
    "charged particle travelling in a medium , a gas , undergo repeated collisions with electrons . as a result a string of ion pairs marks its passage .",
    "this is how kloe came to build the largest drift chamber , dc , in high - energy physics .",
    "a dc is a gas filled chamber traversed by a large number of wires , some kept at + 2000 volt , anode wires , some at ground .",
    "electrons of the ion pairs created along the particle trajectory drift to the positive voltage wires . thanks to an avalanche multiplication mechanism a detectable signal appears at the wire s end . measuring the drift time locates the distance of the track from the anode wires and ultimately we can reconstruct the trajectory of the particles .",
    "sophisticated electronics mounted at the the wire s end senses the tiny signals .",
    "the  dc has 52,000 wires , about 12,500 of them are sense wires , the remaining ones shape the electric field in 12,500 small ( 2x2 , 3x3 cm2 ) cells . for a particle crossing the entire chamber",
    "we get dozens of space points from which we reconstruct a track .",
    "the dc is surrounded by a superconducting coil that produces a magnetic field of 0.5 tesla .",
    "the particle trajectories curl up and we determine the particle s momentum from the curvature of its track with a fractional accuracy of 0.4% .",
    "the spatial resolution is well below 200 @xmath1 m in the `` @xmath0-coordinate '' @xcite .",
    "the neutral decay products of the s , its short - lived partner   ( lifetime  89 picoseconds ) and of those of their charged brethren , the s , which we need to detect , are photons , either directly produced or from the decay of neutral pions into two photons .",
    "photons do not ionize , but interact with matter by photoelectric effect , compton scattering and for energies larger than a few mev ( as in most of our cases ) by electron positron pair production .",
    "electrons and positrons in turn radiate photons when traversing matter , a process quite similar to pair - production .",
    "thus , one readily imagines that a photon , or an electron for that matter , travelling through dense , high @xmath4 matter , repeatedly undergoes radiation and pair production in cascade , until all its energy is expended in a so called shower of  and photons .",
    "detection of these particles and their energy measures the original photon s ( or electron s ) energy .",
    "this is done with a `` calorimeter '' , which also usually pin points the position of the electromagnetic cascade ( or shower ) as well .",
    "the  calorimeter emc , is a sampling calorimeter .",
    "it is made of lead passive layers that accelerate the showering process and of scintillating fiber sensing layers .",
    "energy densities are sampled at different depth along the shower development .",
    "the basic structure of the  calorimeter is a composite of very thin , 1 mm , groved pb layers between which are embedded 1 mm diameter scintillating fibers .",
    "200 pb - fiber layers are used .",
    "the high ratio of active material to radiator and the very fine subdivision result in better energy resolution .",
    "in addition , the special care in design and assembly of the pb - fiber composite ensures that the light propagates along the fiber in a single mode , resulting in a greatly reduced spread of the light arrival time at the fiber ends .",
    "photomultiplier tubes at both fiber ends transform this light into electric pulses .",
    "their amplitude gives the amount of energy deposited .",
    "the arrival times locates the position of the shower to @xmath5(1 ) cm accuracy .",
    "the resulting material has a radiation length @xmath6 of 1.5 cm .",
    "30 cm or 15 @xmath6 fully contain a shower of 500 mev .",
    "about 5000 photomultiplier tubes view the 24 + 32 + 32 modules into which the calorimeter is subdivided .",
    "the calorimeter material is formed into a barrel , aligned with the beams and surrounding the dc . in additions",
    "two end plugs , draped over the magnet pole pieces hermetically close the calorimeter 98% of 4@xmath7 , see fig . .",
    "the kloe calorimeter , emc , with time resolution of the order of 54 picoseconds for a one gev photon , is jocularly referred to as  the fastest calorimeter in the west \" .",
    "the energy resolution of  is also excellent , of the order of 5.7% for a one gev photon @xcite .      at  the electron and positron beams",
    "collide almost head on , @xmath8 mrad .",
    "-mesons are therefore produced with 13 mev / c , in the horizontal plane , toward s center .",
    "the s with its lifetime of 89 ps or 6 mm path length , emit secondary particles almost isotropically from the interaction point ( ip ) . at the ip",
    "the beam pipe is built of an al - be alloy 1 mm thick and shaped as a 10 cm radius sphere , fig . .",
    "+ the  amplitude is reduced by a factor of 5,000 at the sphere surface .",
    "regeneration , , can be neglected in the crucial interference region .",
    "the total  cross section at 1020 mev is 100 ; @xmath1b , of which only 3 @xmath1b is due to -production . in  the collision frequency",
    "reaches up to 3.68,8 , hz .",
    "a trigger is necessary to fire up the electronics , to process signals from some 20,000 detector elements , only when something interesting happened .",
    "we want @xmath0 decays , and a fraction  ( bhabha ) or   events , for   measurement and for continuous monitoring and calibration of .",
    "we also wish to ignore cosmic rays descending into  from the heavens .",
    "an elaborate electronic logic system rapidly recognizes topologies and energy releases of interest , providing the signal or `` trigger '' that something interesting happened .",
    "the kloe trigger is based on isolated energy releases in the calorimeter and the presence of 15 hits in the dc within a time window of 250ns from beam crossing .",
    "this trigger , called level 1 , initiate conversion in the front - end electronics modules , which are subsequently read out following a fixed time interval . a second level trigger , requiring 120 hits within a 1.2-@xmath1s window in the dc validates the trigger .",
    "the  trigger also recognize and ignores cosmic ray events @xcite .",
    "a valid trigger initiates read out .",
    "the trigger system also provides a fast measurement of the  luminosity .",
    "a precision measurement of the luminosity is obtained off - line from bhabha events @xcite .      at a luminosity of 100 @xmath1b / s , events worth keeping occur at 2200 hz . of these 300  hz",
    "are from  decays .",
    "all digitized signals from the calorimeter , drift chamber , calibration and monitoring systems are fed from the electronics that sit on platforms mounted on the  iron yoke , via fiber optics to the  computers in the next building . in the near - by  control room",
    "one can see real time displays of reconstructed charged tracks traversing the dc and photons depositing energy clusters in the calorimeter .",
    "the display of two events is shown in fig , .",
    "the events are reconstructed , meaning that charged tracks and energy deposits that occurred at the same instant in time on the various subcomponents of using constantly updated calibration files that monitor both the time and energy scales , are associated together , properly labelled and packed into a unique file .",
    "furthermore , background hits that accidentally occurred during the time an event time window is open , are also recorded such that these hits can be added on ( superimposed ) on the simulated  events ( mc ) .",
    "the  mc simulation program reproduces the  geometry , physical responses and trigger requirements extremely well , but of course can not foretell the moment to moment variation of the background .",
    "all raw data , background , reconstructed and mc events are recorded on tape .",
    "has a huge tape library of 800  tb capacity @xcite . at reconstruction time",
    ", events are classified into broad categories or `` streams '' .",
    "data summary tapes are produced as a separate procedure .",
    "any of the  analyses , even after event reconstruction is quite complex .",
    "it includes making data summary `` tapes '' and extensive modelling of the detector response .",
    "this requires generation of large number of monte carlo ( mc ) events for each studied process .",
    "both data and mc summaries ( 80  tb ) are cached on disk for analysis @xcite .",
    "the production of  pairs in -decays together with the excellent timing accuracy of the  emc allows us to locate  decay point , in the terrible jargon of today s physicists , a `` neutral vertex '' , to accuracies of 3 ; mm , as illustrated in figure .",
    "this procedure is of fundamental importance in most of  measurements .",
    "the two neutral kaon state from a -decay is given , in the  rest frame , by @xmath9 therefore observation of a ( ) decay ensures the presence of a ( ) meson , travelling in the opposite direction .",
    "this provides the unique opportunity of preparing a pure -beam .",
    "a pure  beam can thus also be defined , although most experiments accomplish the same by simply waiting for the -amplitude to die away .",
    "we refer to the process of defining a  or  sample as tagging : observation of a ( ) decay tags the presence of a ( ) meson of known momentum * p*. because of the exceptional timing capabilities of the  emc and the slowness of the kaons from -decays ,  tags -mesons in a unique way .",
    "as already mentioned , kaon have a velocity @xmath10 in the  frame and @xmath11=0.193 to 0.239 in the lab and 60% of them reach the calorimeter in a time @xmath1231 ns .",
    "-mesons interact in the calorimeter with an energy release up to their mass , 497 mev . for an energy release of 100 mev",
    "has a time resolution of 0.3 ns ,  a velocity accuracy of 1% .",
    "the accuracy in measuring the  velocity , before exact determination of the collision time , is shown in fig . .",
    "+ in , we call a  interaction in the emc a `` k - crash '' . note that the above error on @xmath11 ( ) corresponds to an error on the kaon energy of 0.25 mev or 0.5 mev for the collision energy , with just one event .",
    "we use this method , together with  events to monitor the  energy and energy spread .",
    "since the kaon s discovery about sixty years ago , knowledge of its properties , from masses , lifetimes , and how often each species decays into to which particles , has been accumulated piecemeal literally over hundreds of individual experiments , performed at various laboratories all over the world .",
    "each experiment has its own peculiarity , contingent upon the particle beam available and its own equipment s acceptance range , which can result in highly accurate measurements from a statistical point of view ( namely based on thousands of data events ) but with hidden corrections peculiar to it perhaps unknown even to its authors .",
    "the particle physics `` self - nominated authority '' in charge of compiling the results , often adopt a `` democratic '' way of weighing the various results according to their nominal errors and literally applying a fudge factor when faced with two inconsistent measurements .",
    "while this procedure skirts the problems of judging the relative accuracy of the results obtained over time , it sometimes ends up with a hodge - podge of inconsistent results forced into a mold of dubious scientific validity .",
    "the mission of  is to measure most , if not all , of the properties of the kaon system to high accuracy , with a single detector simultaneously .",
    "moreover , radiation is always present and calculating its effects involves cancellation of infinities .",
    "only if experimental answers are fully inclusive with respect to radiation , can they be compared with calculation in a model .",
    "most branching ratios reported in the past have been very vague on this point .",
    "has been particularly attentive to the inclusion of radiation .    can accomplish the said goal because as described before , 1 , it has available tagged , pure kaon beams ( the only  one ) beams of precisely known momenta ( known event by event , from kinematic closure ) and 2 , of known flux , the number created of each specie , 3 , and catches all the decay products hence determine the fractions of decays into different channels . in short ,",
    "can measure each kaon specie s total decay rate @xmath13 , the inverse of which is the lifetime , and its fractions of decay into different channels , called branching ratio , br .",
    "kaons masses are about 500 mev , very close to one half the -meson mass , known to an accuracy of 0.019/1019.460 2,-5 , by the use of the @xmath14 - 2 depolarizing resonances , @xcite . in",
    "we use the  decay into  and  routinely to monitor the emc and dc performance . measuring the  mass",
    "requires measuring @xmath15=12.05 mev , corresponding to @xmath16=110.2 mev .",
    "given the billions of  decays available in kloe , the statistical error can be arbitrarily small .",
    "the accuracy is ultimately limited by uncertainties in the calculations of radiative corrections .",
    "measures @xmath17   mev @xcite",
    ".      precision measurements of the lifetime of neutral kaons , especially those with many multibody decay modes is particularly difficult since it is in general not possible to prepare monochromatic beams of neutral particles nor to stop them .",
    "enjoys the availability of such monochromatic beams .",
    "while the  lifetime , for many obvious reasons , is quite well known , ( 0.8958 0.0005),-10 , s , this is not the case for the  lifetime .",
    "can measure the lifetime by observing the time dependence of the decay frequency to a single mode .",
    "because of tagging , the lifetime can also be obtained by simply counting the total number of decays in a given time interval from a known sample .",
    "we have collected a sample of 14 million   decays over a 6 - 26 ns interval ( 40% of the  lifetime ) .",
    "a fit of the proper time distribution gives @xmath18  ns @xcite . from the second method , using 2 million decays to all major channels , kloe finds @xmath19  ns .",
    "the two determinations are in agreement and are almost entirely uncorrelated @xcite .",
    "the combined result is 50.840.23 ns , compared to 51.540.44  ns from 1972 .",
    "the measurements of the  lifetime listed in the pdg compilation @xcite exhibit poor consistency .",
    "the pdg fit has a confidence level of 1.5,-3 , , and the error on the recommended value is enlarged by a scale factor of 2.1 .",
    "kloe can measure the decay time for charged kaons in two ways .",
    "the first method is to obtain the proper time from the kaon path length in the dc .",
    "oue preliminary value for the lifetime is @xmath20 = @xmath21 ns , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the second method is based on the precise measurement of the arrival times of the photons from @xmath22 decays and the determination of the decay point from the track vertex in the dc .",
    "it is near completion .",
    "both methods provide results accurate to the level of 0.1% .",
    "as already mentioned , central to  s  studies is the use of -crash tag : the position of the  crash , together with the kinematics of the @xmath23 decay , determines the trajectory of the  with a momentum resolution of approximately 1 mev and an angular resolution of better than 1 . using -crash tag",

    "the basic steps in the analysis are : tag  decays by the  crash , make a cut on the @xmath27 invariant mass ( this removes 95% of the @xmath34 decays and reduces the background - to - signal ratio to 80:1 ) , impose several geometrical cuts to further improve the purity of the sample and , in particular , remove contamination by events with early @xmath35 decays .",
