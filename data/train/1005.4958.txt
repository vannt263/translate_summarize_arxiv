    "clusters of galaxies , as the largest virialised gravitationally - bound products of the process of hierarchical structure formation , are powerful probes for both testing cosmological models and tracing structural evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important properties of galaxy clusters is their mass .",
    "since cluster mass can not be directly observed , it is studied indirectly through observables such as x - ray radiation emitted by the intracluster medium ( icm ) which represents 80% of the total baryonic component of galaxy clusters at z=0 ( @xcite ) and accounts for about 10% of the total ( including dark ) mass content of clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the icm can provide important insights into the evolution and dynamics of cluster and their member galaxies .",
    "observationally , there are two distinct classes of clusters : cool core ( cc ) clusters with dense gaseous core regions in which gas temperature drops inwards , and non - cool core ( ncc ) clusters with shallower core profiles which often exhibit more internal structure ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) . cool core clusters have sharply peaked x - ray emission at their centres due to the rise in central gas density which accompanies the central cooling .",
    "however , the gas is not observed to cool to very low temperatures at the rates naively expected from the observed core x - ray luminosities , and a consensus has now emerged that this is due to the effects of feedback from a central active galactic nucleus , which limits the effects of cooling through processes which are still not very well understood . for reviews of cool cores in clusters ,",
    "see for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in the local universe",
    ", some studies have found that nearly two thirds of clusters have cool cores ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , other studies gave different values : @xcite found a cc fraction as high as 90% , while the results of @xcite indicated that 49% of local clusters host cool cores .",
    "these differences relate to both the selection of the cluster sample , and the way in which cool cores are identified within them .",
    "the evolution of cooling within clusters provides an important probe of the history of cosmic feedback ( @xcite ) . at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , @xcite , using a sample of 38 x - ray - luminous clusters , found that cool cores appeared still to be common , with an incidence nearly identical to that in luminous low - redshift clusters .",
    "consequently , they suggested that heating and cooling processes must have stabilised in massive clusters since @xmath5 .    at higher redshifts",
    ", @xcite reported that the fraction of clusters with cuspy x - ray cores dropped from @xmath670% at @xmath7 to @xmath615% at @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite compared the fraction of clusters with non - cool cores , moderate cool cores and strong cool cores in nearby ( @xmath9 ) and high redshift ( @xmath10 ) clusters .",
    "these authors detected a significant fraction of clusters harbouring moderate cool cores out to z=1.4 , similar to the fraction in their low - redshift sample .",
    "however , they noticed an absence of clusters with strong - cool cores at redshift @xmath11 .    regarding the spatial distribution of the icm , @xcite introduced the @xmath0-@xmath1  profile , motivated by the distribution expected for an isothermal plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium with a virialised mass distribution .",
    "although it is now known that the gas is rarely isothermal , the @xmath0-@xmath1  is generally found to give a reasonable representation of x - ray surface brightness profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , an additional central component is usually required to fit the inner regions of cc clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , and detailed studies of surface brightness profiles of clusters extending to large radii have shown that the logarithmic slope continues to increase slowly towards larger radii ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is less clear whether this progressive steepening is also present in galaxy groups .",
    "for example , @xcite traced the surface brightness out to @xmath12  in two rich groups and found them to be well fitted by simple @xmath0-@xmath1s the whole way .",
    "for @xmath0-@xmath1  fits , the @xmath0 parameter , which characterises the outer slope of the surface brightness profile , has a value of @xmath13 for rich clusters ( @xcite ) and lower values for poor clusters and galaxy groups ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "several studies have shown that @xmath0 has a mild positive trend with the average temperature of the icm in nearby clusters ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and that the value in poorer galaxy groups is lower ( i.e. flatter surface brightness slope ) than that in clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "in terms of evolution , a study of chandra data for 115 clusters spanning the range @xmath14 by @xcite shows some indication that the @xmath0-@xmath2 correlation is weaker for clusters at @xmath8 .",
    "low - mass galaxy clusters or groups , with icm temperatures less than 2 - 3 kev , play an important role in the evolution of galactic systems because they lie at a transition between the field environment and rich cluster environments , and also because non - gravitational processes have a larger impact in groups than in rich clusters ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , these poor systems , and in particular the evolution of their properties , have received rather little attention .",
    "this is mainly due to the difficulty in detecting and studying them , especially at large redshifts , due to their faint x - ray emission and small complement of galaxies .    for these reasons , research on the evolution of galactic systems in the regime of groups and poor clusters",
    "has only started recently , as a result of improvements in observing capabilities in both the x - ray and optical . by comparing optically - selected systems at @xmath15 with nearby groups",
    ", @xcite showed that the fraction of group members undergoing significant star formation increases strongly with redshift out to @xmath16 .",
    "however , the study of x - ray selected groups by @xcite showed a contrary result : they did not observe significant evolution in the morphology or star formation of the galaxy populations in their @xmath17 groups compared to low - redshift x - ray luminous groups .",
    "they argued that this discrepancy could be due to different selection methods , since optically - selected systems are typically lower in mass and contain more spiral galaxies and therefore a stronger evolution in the galaxies is expected .",
    "they also found that their moderate redshift groups had galaxy populations similar to clusters at the same redshift ; in particular , a large fraction of early - type galaxies and a low fraction of galaxies with significant star formation .",
    "however , in contrast to the situation in low redshift x - ray bright groups , a significant fraction of these intermediate redshift groups were found ( @xcite , @xcite ) to have no bright early - type galaxy at the centre of the x - ray emission , or to have a central galaxy with multiple nuclei .",
    "this was taken as evidence for the dynamical youth of many of these groups .",
    "the small number of studies which have addressed the evolution in the x - ray properties of galaxy groups have found little convincing evidence for any .",
    "@xcite , in a multiwavelength study of six galaxy groups and poor clusters at intermediate redshift ( 0.2 - 0.6 ) , found that they appear to follow the scaling relations between luminosity , temperature , and velocity dispersion defined by low - redshift groups and clusters .",
    "this is also true ( @xcite ) for three higher redshift poor clusters from the aegis survey .",
    "a study of evolution in the @xmath18-@xmath2 relation based on the present xmm - lss cluster sample by @xcite , taking into account the selection function of the survey , found that the range of models consistent with the data included self - similar evolution , and also ( marginally ) a no - evolution model .",
    "@xcite extracted a larger sample of 72 clusters ( mostly poor ones ) from the xmm - newton observations of the cosmos field , and found no evidence for evolution in the luminosity function of these systems out to @xmath19 , though the quality of their data did not permit them to study the morphology of the x - ray emission .",
    "motivated by the the paucity of information available for the evolution of the icm in the important environment of low - mass galaxy clusters , we aim in this study to shed light on the spatial distribution of the icm in x - ray selected clusters covering a wide redshift range ( @xmath20 ) , paying special attention to trends in the slope and central cuspiness of the x - ray emission .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows : in section 3.2 , we describe the data and briefly introduce the properties of the cluster sample ; then we describe the data reduction used to produce x - ray surface brightness profiles . in section 3.3 , we present our results , starting with the individual cluster profiles , and then profiles of redshift - stacked and temperature - stacked clusters . in section 3.4 ,",
    "we discuss the implication of our results and compare them with other studies .",
    "finally , in section 3.5 , we summarise our conclusions .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters from the five - year wmap data presented by @xcite , namely : @xmath21  km  s@xmath22  mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "our sample is based on the 29 class 1 ( c1 ) clusters from the x - ray multi - mirror large - scale structure ( xmm - lss ) survey .",
    "the xmm - lss c1 cluster sample is a well - controlled x - ray selected and spectroscopically confirmed cluster sample .",
    "the criteria used to select the members of this sample guarantee negligible contamination of point - like sources .",
    "the observations of the clusters were performed in a homogeneous way ( 10 - 20 ks exposures ) . for full details of the c1 sample ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "detailed information on the selection function of the c1 sample can be found in @xcite .",
    "the c1 sample is dominated by groups and poor clusters with temperatures of @xmath25 kev , spanning a redshift range @xmath26 .",
    "typically , we have a few hundreds x - ray counts for each cluster , with only a few having over a thousand detected photons .",
    "two of the 29 clusters with less than 80 counts had to be excluded from our analysis because their data were inadequate for useful profiles to be extracted .",
    "the excluded clusters are xlssc clusters 39 and 48 .",
    "hence our sample consists of 27 clusters .",
    "cluster 47 , with 81 counts , was a marginal case .",
    "we were unable to constrain a fit to its individual profile , but its data were included in the analysis of the stacked profiles .",
    "key properties of the sample are presented in table [ c1prop ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      to construct the x - ray surface brightness profiles for each cluster",
    ", we used three x - ray fits images , three exposure maps and one segmentation map , all produced using the production pipe line described in @xcite .",
    "the images were taken by the mos1 , mos2 and pn imagers on board the xmm - newton satellite in the energy band [ 0.5 - 2.0 ] kev with exposure times ranging from 10 to 20 ks .",
    "the exposure maps are fits images containing the vignetting - corrected exposure of the clusters as a function of the sky position .",
    "a single segmentation map , generated by sextractor was used for each cluster to remove contaminating sources .    the right ascension",
    "( ra ) and declination ( dec ) values of the centres were determined as outlined in @xcite .",
    "but when we examined the x - ray profiles of the clusters , some showed dips at the centre .",
    "for these clusters , we mosaicked the three images , smoothed the resulting image and took the coordinates of the pixel with the maximum photon counts and modified the cluster centre accordingly .",
    "the modified centres at most are only @xmath614 arcseconds from the original values but remove the central dips in the profiles .",
    "the clusters with modified centres have xlssc numbers : 50,28,40,1,47 and 5 .",
    "the ras and decs in table [ c1prop ] are the modified centres and the original coordinates can be found in table 1 in @xcite . since the angular size of our clusters is small , background removal using a local estimate works well .",
    "the background was taken from an annulus extending from 2@xmath27@xmath12  to 3@xmath27@xmath12  about each cluster , where @xmath12  is the radius within which the mean cluster mass density is 500 times the critical density of the universe at the cluster redshift .",
    "as in @xcite , the @xmath12  values were calculated using @xmath28 where @xmath2 is the icm temperature in kev and @xmath29 is the hubble constant in units of 70.5 @xmath30 . this formula was originally derived from m - t relation of @xcite .",
    "two background components were evaluated : the photon background component and the particle background component .",
    "these were separated using the fact that photons are vignetted , whilst particles are not .",
    "hence the relationship between count rate and effective area for pixels in the background annulus gives an estimate of the photon background component from the slope , and of the particle background component from the intercept .",
    "surface brightness profiles were extracted from a standard set of annuli ( as a fraction of @xmath12  to facilitate later stacking ) , extending to 3@xmath27@xmath12 . for each annulus we removed the particle background and computed the the vignetting - corrected count rate ( in ct / s / pix ) and its error .",
    "the mos1 , mos2 and pn profiles , generated in this way were then combined , and their errors added in quadrature .",
    "profiles were extracted up to 3@xmath27@xmath12  where they flattened and reached the photon background values . the final column in table [ c1prop ]",
    "is the total x - ray counts within 3@xmath27@xmath12after subtracting from it both the photon and the particle background .",
    "the x - ray cameras on the xmm - newton satellite have a point spread function ( psf ) of @xmath6 6 arcsec fwhm , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "correction for psf blurring is important to avoid biased estimation of the parameters of the cluster s radial profile , especially , the core radius , @xmath31 .",
    "we applied the psf correction method used by @xcite ( and described in detail therein ) which analytically computes a photon redistribution matrix ( rdm ) based on the properties of the three xmm - newton cameras and depends on the energy band used and off - axis angle between the centre of the camera and the cluster position .",
    "the psf matrices for the three cameras were weighted by the source counts in each camera and combined to produce a matrix appropriate to the coadded profiles .",
    "we fitted the surface brightness profile with a @xmath0-@xmath1(@xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is central brightness ( cts / s / pix ) and @xmath31  is the core radius ( in units of @xmath12 ) . the model was blurred with the psf redistribution matrix , and fitted to the surface brightness data .",
    "the best values of @xmath31  and @xmath0 were estimated by computing the minimum @xmath34 value on an adaptively refined @xmath31@xmath0 grid .",
    "@xmath35 errors were computed for @xmath31  and @xmath0 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 error regions computed in the @xmath31@xmath0 plane for each fit .    as will be seen below ,",
    "a number of systems show a central excess above the fitted @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "such a central cusp suggests the possible presence of a cool core .",
    "since a central excess may distort the @xmath0-@xmath1  fit , we attempted to fit a model with the central bin excluded , but given the limited statistical quality of our data , loss of the central bin resulted in poorly behaved fits in many cases .",
    "we therefore adopted the approach of fitting a @xmath0-@xmath1  with core radius fixed at a value ( as a fraction of @xmath12 ) motivated by the observed profiles of local groups in which detailed modelling of the surface brightness has been possible .",
    "a central excess above this model then indicates the presence of a cuspy core .",
    "the fixed value of the core radius we adopt as a canonical value for poor clusters is taken from @xcite , who studied 24 x - ray - bright galaxy groups .",
    "for half of their sample they found that two - component @xmath0-@xmath1s were required to give acceptable fits to the surface brightness distribution .",
    "the outer component represented the intragroup gas , whilst core emission could be distinguished by a clear shoulder in the profile in many cases , and was fitted by the inner @xmath0-@xmath1  component .",
    "the median value of @xmath31  for the outer component in the 12 clusters was found to be 60 kpc .",
    "correcting to our value of @xmath38 , this median @xmath31  would be 42.6 kpc .",
    "the 12 systems in @xcite had an average temperature of 1.07 kev . to calculate this @xmath31  as a fraction of @xmath39",
    ", we used the @xmath40 equation above , which gives @xmath31=@xmath41 .",
    "this value of @xmath31  was therefore used in our fixed - core fits .    to quantitatively determine whether a profile of a cluster ( or a stacked set of clusters ) has a central brightness excess , and therefore a cc",
    ", we define the central excess factor ( @xmath42 ) as the ratio between the observed surface brightness and predicted surface brightness ( from the fitted fixed - core model ) for the innermost radial bin , at @xmath43 @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath42 is greater than 1 then this was considered as an indication that the cluster has a cc and vice versa .",
    "the error on @xmath42 is derived simply from the error on the innermost surface brightness value .",
    "we checked the effects of excluding the central bin for the fixed - core fits .",
    "this has little effect on the fitted @xmath0 value , but in cases where there is a central excess , it results in a somewhat lower normalisation for the fitted model , and hence a slightly ( up to 10% ) higher value of @xmath42 .",
    "the statistical quality of our individual profiles is limited , so we stacked the observed profiles of clusters with similar redshifts and temperatures , producing higher quality profiles which might highlight any trends with temperature or redshift .    since each cluster has a different @xmath12",
    ", we extracted the profiles in fixed radial bins in units of @xmath12  up to 3@xmath27@xmath12 . the range from ( 0 - 1)@xmath27@xmath12  was divided into 20 equally spaced bins , from ( 1 - 2)@xmath27@xmath12  into 15 equally spaced bins and the range from ( 2 - 3)@xmath27@xmath12  into 10 equally spaced bins .",
    "these different bin widths allow for the decline in flux with radius whilst keeping the inner bins sufficiently fine to resolve the core .",
    "this distribution of bins was chosen after some experimentation to obtain the best fit constraints .    before the stacking",
    ", the profiles were multiplied by the scale factor : @xmath44 where @xmath45 to account for the cluster line of sight depth , @xmath46 to correct for the change in critical density of the universe and @xmath47 to eliminate the effect of cosmological dimming .",
    "the aim of the scaling is to allow for the effects of variable cluster depth and for cosmological factors , so that all profiles would be similar ( to within the rather weak temperature dependence of the x - ray emissivity ) in the case where clusters are simple self - similar systems , evolving with the critical density of the universe .",
    "the profiles for each component cluster were then added bin by bin and their errors quadratically summed to generate a stacked profile .",
    "the photon background values for each cluster were scaled by the same factors as the source profiles , before being combined . this coadded photon background",
    "was then included in the fitted model as a fixed background level .",
    "the psf redistribution matrices were weighted by the scaled count rate for each cluster before being combined to produce a composite matrix .",
    "most individual c1 clusters profiles fit successfully with a free@xmath31@xmath0-@xmath1 , and nearly all have well - constrained fixed@xmath31  @xmath0-@xmath1fits .",
    "the profile of cluster 47 , with only 81 counts , is the only one for which we could not achieve a useful @xmath0-@xmath1  fit . for clusters 51 ( 160 counts ) , 49 ( 157 counts ) and 5 ( 130 counts ) ,",
    "although best fit models were obtained , the upper bound of the free@xmath31  @xmath0 values were not constrained , and no @xmath31@xmath0 contour plots could be produced .",
    "the surface brightness profiles with fits and associated @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 error contours for individual clusters with redshift ranges 0.05 - 0.17 , 0.26 - 0.33 and 0.43 - 1.05 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ind_prof1 ] , [ ind_prof2 ] and [ ind_prof3 ] respectively , and numerical results are given in table  [ c1prop ] .",
    "the profile of cluster 50 is unusual ; it has a remarkably large @xmath31  value , of 1.12@xmath27@xmath12  ( see fig .",
    "[ ind_prof1 ] ) , and an elongated spatial extension indicating a cluster in a state of merging , with a highly unrelaxed core .    amongst the 26 clusters with constrained fixed-@xmath31  fits , 21 ( 81% )",
    "possess ccs according to the criterion outlined above ( i.e. @xmath48  @xmath49 ) , whilst the remaining five ( 19% ) are non - cool core ( ncc ) ( @xmath48  @xmath50 ) systems , as shown in table [ c1prop ] .",
    "however , for some of these , the classification must be regarded as uncertain , since the error bar on @xmath48  crosses unity .",
    "this is the case for 7 ( from the 21 ) cc systems , and 2 ( of the five ) ncc clusters .",
    "hence , at the 1@xmath51 level , 54% ( 14 out of 26 ) of our clusters show a central excess in surface brightness which may indicate the presence of a cool core .",
    "the median value of @xmath0 for free-@xmath31  fits to the 26 clusters is 0.61 .",
    "a similar median value ( @xmath0=0.63 ) is obtained from the fixed@xmath31   fits . as for the @xmath31 ,",

    "as expected , this is rather smaller than the canonical value of 0.105@xmath27@xmath12  for the group scale component of the emission , due to the influence on the fits of cuspy cores in many systems .",
    "the c1 clusters span a redshift range of 0.05 to 1.05 . to probe how the x - ray surface brightness profiles evolve with redshift , we divided the c1 sample into three redshift ranges : 0.05 - 0.17 ( low@xmath52 ) , 0.26 - 0.33 ( intermediate@xmath52 ) and 0.43 - 1.05 ( high@xmath52 )",

    ", this is the best sample of x - ray selected groups at @xmath96 studied to date , and hence our individual and stacked x - ray profiles of these clusters provide the best available x - ray profile of low - mass clusters at intermediate redshift , and should be useful for future comparative studies .",
    "the individual x - ray profiles with the the @xmath31@xmath0 contours for these cluster are shown in fig .",
    "[ ind_prof2 ] and the stacked profile is the second panel in fig . [ zstack_prof ] .",
    "the free-@xmath31  fit to the stacked profile for these clusters gives @xmath100 ( see table [ results_stack ] , second row ) which is in agreement with studies of low redshift groups ( see for example , @xcite and @xcite ) . @xcite attributed the fact that the slopes of group surface brightness profiles are flatter than the canonical slope ( @xmath0=0.67 ) for clusters , as a result of the effects of feedback from galactic winds on the intergalactic medium .",
    "the stacked data show a central excess , with @xmath101 , indicating that these systems typically possess ccs .",
    "the individual profiles of @xmath96 clusters in fig .",
    "[ ind_prof2 ] , also support this results ; the central excess factor , @xmath42 is greater than unity for 7 of the 12 clusters ( 25,51,22,8,28,40 and 10 ) and an additional 4 clusters ( 44,13,18 and 23 ) have best fit @xmath102 , but with error bars crossing unity .",
    "so , we conclude that 58 - 92% of our systems at @xmath103 have ccs .",
    "the fitted @xmath31  for the stacked profiles is @xmath104 .",
    "the main results of our analysis are the presence of trends in the value of @xmath0 , and in the incidence of cuspy cores , with redshift and temperature .",
    "our c1 clusters , as for any deep cluster survey , suffer from _ malmquist _ selection effects , which result in increasing mean cluster luminosity with redshift , due to the fact that higher redshift clusters are more difficult to detect than nearby ones ",
    "see fig . 3 in @xcite .",
    "given the well - known correlation between x - ray luminosity and temperature , there is a corresponding tendency for more distant clusters in our sample to be hotter .",
    "this correletaion between @xmath52 and @xmath2 within our sample , makes it difficult to establish whether our observed trends in @xmath0 and @xmath48  are evolutionary effects , or whether they represent changes in cluster properties with system mass ( and hence temperature ) .",
    "we attempt to address this issue in two ways : firstly , we can examine whether the trends we see ( in both individual and stacked clusters ) are stronger with respect to @xmath2 or @xmath52 .",
    "secondly , we use the group of clusters at @xmath103 ; subdividing these by temperature allows us to check for trends with @xmath2 at essentially a single redshift .",
    "similarly , we also extract a subset of our clusters which cover a rather narrow temperature range , but a larger spread in @xmath52 .",
    "to investigate whether the trends we see in the redshift - stacked sets are affected by the @xmath2-@xmath52 correlation in our sample , we select six clusters with similar temperatures ( @xmath54=1.20 to 1.34 kev ) but a relatively wide spread in redshift ( @xmath52=0.14 to 0.30 ) .",
    "these are then divided into two subsets , each consisting of three systems : the first has @xmath105 ( average @xmath52=0.19 ) and mean temperature @xmath106=1.28 kev , the second has @xmath107 ( average @xmath108 ) and @xmath106=1.27 kev .",
    "the fit results for these subsets are shown in fig .",
    "[ zsub_prof ] and in table [ results_stack ] .",
    "similarly , we divided the twelve @xmath96 clusters , which span a temperature range of 1.0 - 2.8 kev , into two temperature bins : 1.0 - 1.6 kev and 1.7 - 2.8 kev with six clusters in each .",
    "see fig . [ tsub_prof ] and the last two rows in table [ results_stack ] for the results of stacking these subsets .",
    "the 1.0 - 1.6 kev clusters have an average redshift @xmath109 and average temperature @xmath106=1.28 kev , while the 1.7 - 2.8 kev clusters have the same average redshift @xmath109 and @xmath106=2.1 kev .    the results from these subsets , shown in fig .",
    "[ zsub_prof ] and [ tsub_prof ] , reinforce the impression from fig .",
    "[ zstack_prof ] and [ tstack_prof ] that the increase in profile cuspiness is a function of @xmath52 rather than @xmath2 . in fact , the temperature - stacked subset ( fig . [ tsub_prof ] ) actually shows a _ decline _ in @xmath48  with temperature , whilst in the redshift - stacked subset it increases from 1.49 for the @xmath105 clusters to 1.98 for the @xmath110 clusters ( fig .",
    "[ zsub_prof ] ) .",
    "we also tested the @xmath48@xmath52 behaviour in the individual profiles . in fig .",
    "[ d_fc_z ] , we plot @xmath48  against redshift for the individual c1 clusters .",
    "the figure shows that the high@xmath52 clusters tend to have larger - than - unity values of @xmath48  more often than clusters at lower redshift .",
    "we tested for a correlation in this plot , using the pearson correlation coefficient , which has a value 0.40 for 26 points , corresponding to a student t value of 2.12 , which shows a poitive correlation at over 95% significance ( 2-tailed test ) . to visualise the trend more clearly , we grouped adjacent data points into three bins and computed their weighted mean and the standard error .",
    "these binned results are shown as diamonds , though it should be noted that resulting values are sensitive to the choice of bin boundaries .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath48-temperature plot in fig . [ d_fc_t ] , shows no monotonic trend in @xmath48  with @xmath2 , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.01 .",
    "the binned values ( diamonds ) agree well the temperature - stacked results discussed earlier , where we noticed that intermediate - temperature clusters had the highest central excess .",
    "the present work is the first study of the _ evolution _ of ccs within galaxy groups , although previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) has shown that ccs are common in x - ray bright groups at low redshift .",
    "richer clusters have received much more study .",
    "cc clusters are found to be common at low and moderate redshifts , see @xcite , but @xcite found only a very small fraction of clusters at @xmath1110.5 to have cuspy x - ray brightness profiles , which were taken as an indication of cool cores .",
    "@xcite found moderate cc clusters out to @xmath112 , but noted an absence of _ strong _ ccs at redshifts higher than 0.7 .",
    "our results therefore suggest that groups behave differently to clusters , in that cuspy cores are actually _ more _ prominent at higher @xmath52 in these poorer systems .",
    "how can we understand this difference ?",
    "one possibility is that the central excess seen in groups at moderate - high @xmath52 is not due to ccs at all , but to the presence of central agn .",
    "we can immediately rule out the possibility that the effect is due to just a few groups with bright agn contaminating our stacked profiles by noting ( cf .",
    "[ d_fc_z ] ) that a central excess is seen in the _ majority _ of systems at @xmath1110.3 .",
    "hence , any effect from central agn would have to be widespread and moderate",
    ".    there would be significant spectral differences between central excesses generated by ccs and agn , since the thermal emission from cool cores is much softer than the x - ray spectra of agn .",
    "the limited statistics for individual clusters in our sample do not permit us to investigate whether the core emission is soft or hard .",
    "however , this can be investigated using the stacked data .",
    "we therefore repeated the stacking analysis for intermediate- and high-@xmath52 clusters using x - ray images derived from the hard energy band , 2.0 - 4.5 kev .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ hardprofiles ] . comparing with the corresponding soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) band profiles in fig .",
    "[ zstack_prof ] , we notice the disappearance of the central excess above the @xmath0-@xmath1  in the hard - energy profiles in both the intermediate and high redshift stacks .",
    "this provides strong evidence that this central excess does not arise from agn in cluster cores .    assuming that the cuspy profiles really do indicate the presence of ccs ,",
    "the observation of such cores in groups at high redshift can help to constrain the reasons for their absence in high @xmath52 clusters .",
    "the decline in cc clusters with redshift could result from disruption of ccs due to the higher merging rates at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) or from the effects of preheating ( @xcite ) , which can raise the gas entropy and prevent cooling .",
    "in the latter case , the impact of a given entropy boost will be larger in cooler systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) , especially at high redshift , so one would expect if anything to see a _",
    "drop _ in the incidence of ccs within groups at high @xmath52 , at least as large as pronounced as that in richer clusters .",
    "the hypothesis that ccs are destroyed by cluster mergers appears more promising , since this effect might be stronger in more massive systems .",
    "for example , @xcite find that ccs are more common in low mass clusters , and attribute the lack of ccs in more massive systems to their destruction by early mergers in systems destined to grow into large clusters . on the other hand , these authors caution that their model does not reproduce the observed reduction with redshift in ccs within massive clusters . in fact , no numerical simulations have yet succeeded in adequately reproducing the properties of cluster cores .",
    "whilst it seems quite clear , as discussed above , that the trend in central cuspiness is primarily related to redshift , rather than temperature , the situation with regard to @xmath0 is not so straightforward . in the stacked datasets , comparison of fig .",
    "[ zstack_prof ] and [ tstack_prof ] suggest that the relationship with redshift is stronger : @xmath0 rises monotonically through the three redshift intervals , whilst in temperature the only clear result is that the cool systems have lower @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the fits to individual clusters ( fig .",
    "[ d_beta_z ] and [ d_beta_t ] ) show a more pronounced trend with temperature than with redshift .",
    "the stacked subsets of the narrow temperature and redshift ranges ( fig .",
    "[ tsub_prof ] and [ zsub_prof ] ) produce ambiguous results : @xmath0 increases with temperature if @xmath31  is fixed , but with @xmath52 if @xmath31  is left free to fit .",
    "so , on the basis of our data alone , we are unable to say whether the general trend in @xmath0 is driven by the temperature or the redshift .",
    "however , evidence from studies of low redshift groups and clusters is very relevant here .",
    "such studies provide clear evidence of a positive correlation between @xmath0 and temperature in local systems systems ",
    "e.g. , @xcite and fig .",
    "7 in the study of @xcite , who analysed clusters with redshift @xmath113 . combining these previous results with ours ,",
    "favours a trend in @xmath0 with temperature ( and hence cluster mass ) rather than an evolutionary effect .",
    "our results then demonstrate that this trend is still present in groups and clusters at @xmath114 .",
    "in this paper , we used _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations of 27 x - ray selected galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range ( @xmath115 ) to study the spatial properties of their icm .",
    "most of these clusters fall in the realm of low - mass clusters or groups , with icm temperatures from 0.63 to 4.80  kev .",
    "the xmm data provide typically a few hundreds x - ray source counts .",
    "we extracted and vignetting - corrected the profiles to 3@xmath27@xmath12  where they flattened and reached the photon background values , which were estimated locally for each cluster .",
    "in addition to the individual profiles , we also stacked the profiles into three redshift and temperature bins . to explore the effects of _ malmquist bias _ , we further stacked clusters with similar redshifts / temperatures into two subsets each with different averaged temperature / redshift .",
    "both individual and stacked profiles were fitted with blurred ( to account for the psf errors of the _ xmm - newton _ cameras ) @xmath0-@xmath1s with both free and fixed core radii .",
    "the fixed-@xmath31  @xmath0-@xmath1  fits were used to test whether a profile showed evidence of a cuspy core , making this study the first to probe the evolution of ccs out to @xmath3 within poor clusters .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * we find that 54% of our sample show evidence for cool cores , in the form of a central excess ( at @xmath116 significance ) above a standard @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "* for the free-@xmath31  fits to individual clusters , the median value of @xmath0 is 0.61 , and the median @xmath31  is 0.08@xmath27@xmath12 .",
    "* for the fixed-@xmath31  fits to individual clusters , the median @xmath0 is 0.63 . * twelve systems in our sample ( with @xmath117 kev )",
    "have @xmath96 , allowing us to characterise the x - ray surface brightness profiles of intermediate redshift x - ray selected groups .",
    "the free - fit parameters to the stacked data from these 12 systems gives @xmath118 and @xmath31=@xmath119@xmath12 .",
    "this stacked profile indicates the presence of ccs ( @xmath101 ) , with 7 of the 12 systems showing a significant central excess in their individual profiles . *",
    "stacked and individual profiles for our sample of poor galaxy clusters show that the ccs do not disappear at high redshift , but rather become more prominent , though one would like to confirm this result with higher spatial resolution observations .",
    "* the slope parameter , @xmath0 , shows a positive trend with both redshift and temperature in our data . combining this results with previous findings",
    ", we incline towards a trend with temperature ( and hence mass ) rather than redshift .",
    "the present study then demonstrates for the first time , that the @xmath0-@xmath2 trend seen at low @xmath52 is also present in groups and clusters at @xmath3 .",
