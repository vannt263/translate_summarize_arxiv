    "much interest is currently devoted to the study of electronic transport properties in carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) , both metallic and semiconducting .",
    "the main reason is the possibility to use cnts in electronic integrated circuits thanks to catalizator - assisted on - site growth  @xcite .",
    "semiconducting cnts are envisageables as new components for transistors and logic circuits  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "metallic cnts are particularly suited as a new type of interconnects due to their small dimensions and the large electron current density ( @xmath010@xmath1 a/@xmath2 ) they can support .",
    "the current vs. voltage ( iv ) curve of metallic single - wall carbon nanotube ( swnts ) has been recently measured by several groups  @xcite . for voltages",
    "@xmath3  v , they observe a sudden increase of the resistivity which is due to the scattering with optical phonons . in long tubes ,",
    "this leads to a saturation current of @xmath0 25  @xmath4a for voltages",
    "@xmath5  v. such behavior limits the performances of metallic swnts as interconnects .",
    "the understanding of this phenomenon is , thus , a crucial step toward finding methods to boost swnts performances and has important technological consequences .",
    "two recent papers  @xcite suggested the possibility that , at high bias , the electron transport induces an anomalously high optical - phonons occupation ( hot phonons ) which , in turn , induces an increase of the resistivity . in ref .",
    ", this hypothesis is formulated on the basis of the comparison between scattering lengths ( obtained from iv measurements  @xcite ) and electron - phonon coupling values ( obtained from ab - initio calculations  @xcite and inelastic x - ray scattering measurements  @xcite ) . however , the extent of ref .",
    "conclusions is limited , because ref .",
    "does not provide neither a scheme to reproduce experimental iv curves , nor a reliable quantitative determination of the phonon occupation .",
    "the conclusions of ref .   apply to tubes which are lying on a substrate .",
    "this is the very typical situation encountered in experiments",
    ".    ref .",
    "reports the comparison between iv curves measured on swnts in two different situations : when the tubes are lying on a substrate and when the tubes are suspended between the two electrodes .",
    "concludes that hot phonons are present in the tubes which are suspended but are absent in those which are lying on a substrate ( for bias @xmath6  v ) .",
    "the presence of hot phonons is clearly demonstrated by the experimental observation of a negative differential resistance in suspended tubes . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of hot - phonons is inferred from a simplified theoretical model in which the electron scattering length ( at zero temperature ) is a fitting parameter .",
    "the claim of absence of hot phonons , for the tubes lying on a substrate , is contradicting the conclusions of ref .  , where the scattering length is obtained from ab - initio calculations of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "concluding , a quantitative model to describe the anomalous phonon heating is not available .",
    "moreover , given the contradicting conclusions of refs .  , it is not clear whether hot phonons generation is present for tubes lying on a substrate",
    ". this last point is particularly relevant .",
    "in fact , if the high - bias resistance measured for tubes lying on a substrate  @xcite is due to hot phonons  @xcite , one could conceive some methods to reduce the optical phonon temperature and thus diminish the high bias resistance .",
    "this would not be possible if hot phonons were not present in tubes lying on a substrate  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we solve the coupled boltzmann transport equations for both phonons and electrons to determine in a consistent way the iv curve and the phonon occupation in metallic swnts .",
    "the quantitative determination of the anomalous phonon heating during electron transport allows us to settle the debate on the presence / absence of hot phonons in nanotubes lying on a substrate .",
    "we are interested in the high bias ( @xmath7  v ) region , where the transport properties are determined by the scattering with optical phonons .",
    "we use the zero - temperature electron scattering lengths obtained from ab - initio calculations based on the density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "in a metallic swnt , there are only two phonons which can be generated by transport electrons via a back - scattering process  @xcite . using the graphene notation , they correspond to the e@xmath8 lo ( here lo stands for longitudinal along the tube axis ) mode at @xmath9 and to the a@xmath10 mode at * k * ( equivalent of the a@xmath10 at * k * )  @xcite . for simplicity , we label them @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",

    "electron transport can induce not - thermal high - occupation of phonons if the generation time of the phonons ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) is shorter than their thermalization time . for metallic swnts ,",
    "the optical - phonons thermalization time @xmath20 is due to anharmonic scattering into acoustic phonons  @xcite .",
    "time - resolved terahertz spectroscopy measurements  @xcite , on graphite , reported an optical - phonon thermalization time of 7  ps .",
    "this value is comparable with the optical - phonon linewidth of diamond ( the other carbon polymorph ) @xmath01",
    "@xmath21 , which corresponds to a relaxation time of 5  ps , and is due to phonon - phonon scattering  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath20 value of the same order is also obtained by preliminary calculations of phonon - phonon scattering on graphite and nanotubes  @xcite done with the ab - initio methods of refs .  .",
    "concluding , we expect @xmath20 to be of the order of 5  ps . since @xmath18 and @xmath22 are much smaller than @xmath235  ps , hot - phonon generation is _ a priori _ expected to occur during electron transport in metallic swnts .        in the following , we consider the model schematized in fig .

    "<S> we show that the self - consistent dynamics of both phonons and electrons is the necessary ingredient for the reliable description of the hot phonons generation during electron transport in metallic single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the coupled boltzmann transport equations to determine in a consistent way the current vs. voltage ( iv ) curve and the phonon occupation in metallic swnts which are lying on a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we find a good agreement with measured iv curves and we determine an optical phonon occupation which corresponds to an effective temperature of several thousands k ( hot phonons ) , for the voltages typically used in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the high - bias resistivity strongly depends on the optical phonon thermalization time . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a drastic improvement of metallic nanotubes performances can be achieved by increasing the coupling of the optical phonons with a thermalization source . </S>"
