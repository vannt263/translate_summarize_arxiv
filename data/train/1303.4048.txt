    "following this , hu and qi proposed the normalized laplacian tensor ( or simply laplacian ) and made some explorations on it @xcite , which is the analogue of the spectral graph theory investigated by chung @xcite .    in spectral graph theory , it is well known that the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix is equal to the number of connected components of the graph , and the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue of the signless laplacian matrix is equal to the number of bipartite connected components of the graph @xcite . in this paper , we investigate their analogues in spectral hypergraph theory .",
