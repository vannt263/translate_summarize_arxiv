    " record values are of interest and important in many real life applications involving data relating to meteorology , sport , economics and life testing . sometimes , the experimenter has some knowledge about the parameter of interest , either from past experience , or from experience with similar situations .",
    "this prior information may be incorporated in the estimation process using a preliminary test estimator @xcite and improved the estimation process .",
    "preliminary test and shrinkage estimation in the one and two - parameter exponential distributions are considered by many authors including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables having the same distribution .",
    "an observation @xmath1 will be called an upper record value if exceeds in value all of the preceding observations , i.e. , if @xmath2 , for every @xmath3 . the sequence of record times is defined as follows : @xmath4 with probability 1 and , @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "a sequence of upper record values is defined by @xmath7 , @xmath8. for details on record values and other interesting topics related to records see @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "the estimation of the scale parameter in two exponential distributions based on record values is studied .",
    "when two record samples from exponential distributions are available , the question of whether to pool or not to pool these two record samples is often determined via a preliminary test . if the test is not statistically significant , the pooled estimator is used ; otherwise , the likelihood estimator is used",
    ". the optimum level of statistical significance for the usual preliminary test estimator are obtained in section [ sec.prt ] by using the minimax regret criterion .",
    "a shrinkage estimator is also considered .",
    "the optimum values of shrinkage coefficients for the shrinkage estimator are obtained in section [ sec.shr]. the proposed estimators are illustrated using an example , .and are compared using simulation in section [ sec.num ] .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables from two exponential models with the following probability density function : @xmath11 also , suppose that we observe @xmath12 and @xmath13 upper record values from these two sequences as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
