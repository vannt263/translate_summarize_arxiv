    "the understanding of physical states in qcd is of fundamental importance .",

    "it is also important for a non - perturbative formulation of qcd .",
    "gribov @xcite showed many years ago that the coulomb gauge in qcd does not fully fix the gauge and is inadequate for a non - perturbative formulation of qcd .",
    "later , singer @xcite and narasimhan and ramadas @xcite proved that the gribov problem can not be resolved by choosing another gauge condition since the gauge bundle on the qcd configuration space is twisted .    in this paper , we argue that as a consequence of the above twisted nature of the qcd bundle , coloured states restricted to the algebra of local observables are necessarily mixed : they carry entropy .",
    "this argument is confirmed in a matrix model for gluons we also propose here .",
    "this model is @xmath3 dimensional and free of the technical problems of quantum field theory .    the matrix model , being a quantum mechanical model of @xmath4 real matrices , for @xmath5 colours , and capturing certain essential topological aspects of qcd offers a new approach to qcd calculations .",
    "it is also suitable for the study of t hooft s large @xmath1 limit . as an explicit illustration of the power of our approach ,",
    "we show that the gluon spectrum has a gap in our model . in lattice calculations",
    "this is taken as a signal for confinement .    for @xmath2 and 3",
    ", we also use simple variational calculations to estimate low - lying glueball masses .",
    "detailed numerical work is on progress .    just as in a soliton model",
    ", it is necessary to quantise the excitations around our matrix model solutions in a full quantum field theory . in this connection",
    ", we note that the matrix model contains the vacuum sector where the gluon potential is gauge equivalent to the zero field .",
    "we also indicate how to construct multiparticle levels for our gluon levels adapting standard techniques in soliton physics @xcite .    in a paper under preparation",
    ", we will argue that qcd has different phases , and also calculate the glueball spectrum in these phases .",
    "the dirac operator in the matrix model approach will also be discussed .",
    "let @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being gell - mann matrices , denote the qcd vector potentials ( in our convention , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ) in the temporal @xmath11 gauge .",

    "the qcd gauge group @xmath14 is the group @xmath15 of maps from @xmath16 to @xmath17 with the asymptotic condition ( time argument is suppressed ) @xmath18 ( see also the sky group in this respect @xcite . )",
    "the group @xmath14 acts on @xmath19 according to @xmath20    there are two normal subgroups of @xmath14 of importance here , @xmath21 as discussed elsewhere @xcite , the gauss law generates @xmath22 which therefore acts trivially on the physical quantum states .",
    "the group @xmath22 is normal in @xmath23 and @xmath24 its representations @xmath25 characterise the @xmath26-states of @xmath27 .",
    "the colour group is @xmath28    all observables commute with the gauss law , that is , @xmath22 . in quantum physics , observables are also _ local _",
    "@xcite , that is , they are obtained by smearing standard quantum fields with test functions with supports in compact spacetime regions . in the canonical formalism",

    "call such a field @xmath30 .",
    "the action of @xmath31 on @xmath30 depends only on the restriction @xmath32 of @xmath33 to @xmath29 . but @xmath32 can be smoothly extended beyond @xmath29 to a gauge transformation @xmath34 .",
    "there are many ways of doing so and for each @xmath35 , by gauss law , if @xmath30 is an observable , then @xmath36 hence , @xmath37 so that _ all local observables commute with elements of @xmath14_.    the configuration space @xmath12 for local observables is thus associated with @xmath38 and not @xmath39 as naive considerations using the gauss law would suggest .",

    "indeed , an element of @xmath39 is @xmath47 the action of @xmath48 on this element is @xmath49 since @xmath22 is normal in @xmath14 . to see explicitly that the action is not free , choose @xmath50 and @xmath51 with lie algebra basis @xmath52 to find that @xmath53 leaves @xmath54 invariant .",

    "for the variational ansatz for the ground state , we take @xmath288 and minimise with respect to the parameter @xmath289 .",
    "we find @xmath290 minimizing with respect to @xmath289 gives the variational ground state energy @xmath291 .",
    "it is plotted in figure 1 as a function of thooft coupling @xmath292 .",
    "similarly , we can take the ansatz @xmath293 for the first excited state .",
    "this is an impure state because the colour index @xmath294 is not `` soaked up '' .",
    "we then calculate @xmath295 to find @xmath296    its minimum @xmath297 is plotted against @xmath298 in figure 2 .",
    "notice that both these trial wave functions are insensitive to the @xmath299 term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest ansatz that is sensitive to this term is @xmath300 this has three variational parameters : @xmath301 and @xmath289 .",
    "the variational energy for this ansatz is shown in figure 3 .",
    "our variational energy estimate is rather crude , and is presented here for representational purposes only .",
    "we expect that the variational estimate differs significantly from the true energy for large values of thooft coupling @xmath302 .",
    "much better numerical estimates may be obtained by taking more sophisticated ( or complicated ! )",
    "variational ansatz for the wavefunctions .",
    "we will not do it here .",
    "considerations using @xmath19 in sections 2 and 3 were formal , whereas the matrix model for @xmath5 is that of a particle with @xmath222 degrees of freedom .",
    "it is a well - defined quantum mechanical model , which captures the colour twist topology of @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath107-algebra @xmath303 of the observables are made up of colour singlets .",
    "it contains colour singlet functions of @xmath156 .",
    "( more precisely , we consider only bounded operators of this sort ) .",
    "the full @xmath303 is generated by such operators .",
    "we can now adapt section 3 to show that coloured states restricted to @xmath304 are not pure .",
    "the one definite result we have in the work is the conclusion that coloured states in qcd are mixed . that will affect correlators and partition functions and hence physical predictions . calculations in this directions have not been done .",
    "in addition , we have developed a matrix model for pure qcd which gives a gapped spectrum and discrete levels for glueballs .",
    "our present work can be generalised to other gauge groups .",
    "we conclude with a few further remarks on the matrix model .    1 .",
    "we can couple quarks to @xmath238 by using covariant derivative @xmath305 in the dirac operators , this being its only modification in the @xmath11 gauge .",
    "2 .   we can construct qcd @xmath26-states as follows .",

    "@xcite : @xmath315 hence @xmath316 + thus given a vector state @xmath317 for @xmath318 , we can get the one @xmath319 with non - zero @xmath26 as follows : @xmath320 with this formula , concrete calculations can be done using the hamiltonian @xmath249 .",
    "3 .   we can build multiparticle states for our gluon levels from ( [ left - inv-1-form ] ) by changing @xmath267 to higher winding number maps as in skyrmion physics @xcite .",
    "4 .   that coloured states are impure states have deep implications for the confinement problem . consider the time - evolution of a pure ( and hence colourless ) state .",
    "since time evolution in quantum theory is given by a unitary operator , this state will _ never _ evolve to a coloured state .",
    "thus it is impossible to create a free gluon starting from a colourless state by any hamiltonian evolution , and in particular by scattering .",
    "the mixed coloured states we obtain are convex combinations of pure states . of these ,",
    "at most one can be in the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the mean energy in such mixed states is infinite @xcite .",
    "this is an additional argument in support of the relevance of these mixed states for the confinement problem in yang - mills theories .",
