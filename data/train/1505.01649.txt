    "in october 2006 , the double _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo ; ) was launched , and at the end of january 2007 the two spacecraft separated and entered into heliocentric orbits near 1  au in opposite directions . the ahead",
    "( a ) probe leads the earth , while the behind ( b ) probe lags behind the earth , drifting about @xmath0 per year from the sun  earth line . in february 2011 , the two stereo spacecraft were already in the quadrature with the earth , providing the first ever complete @xmath1 view of the sun . at the end of july 2014",
    ", the two spacecraft were located on the opposite sides of the earth s orbit ; stereo - a was ahead of the earth by @xmath2 , and stereo - b was @xmath3 behind the earth .",
    "each stereo spacecraft is equipped with an almost identical set of extreme ultraviolet , optical , radio , and in situ instruments . in particular , the _ sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation suit _",
    "( secchi ; ) includes the _ extreme ultraviolet imager _ ( euvi ; ) providing solar images in four channels of 171 , 195 , 284 , and 304   .    with an increase of the longitudinal separation between the two stereo spacecraft and each of them with the sun",
    " earth line , the number of flares registered with the a and/or b probes but invisible from earth has been growing . among the problems in studies of the backside flares is classifying their importance , which would allow one to compare them with flares recorded by near - earth satellites .",
    "stereo observations and information about the importance of far - side flares are significant for investigations of such solar activity phenomena as flares themselves , eruptions , large - scale coronal waves , coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , solar energetic particles ( seps ) .",
    "these observational studies are promising to achieve further progress in understanding and modeling these phenomena as well as space weather forecasting ( e.g. , ; ; ; @xcite @xcite ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "currently , in addition to the classification of flares based on the intensity and emission area in the h@xmath4 line , the soft x - ray flare ( sxr ) classification is generally accepted and widely used .",
    "the c , m , and x sxr classes of flares are determined according to the peak fluxes measured by the _ geostationary operational environmental satellite _",
    "( goes ; ) 18    detectors in the ranges of ( 110 ) @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7  w  m@xmath8 , respectively .    addressed the problem of classification of the stereo backside flares calculating the euvi 195    full - disk emission fluxes as a total output of the charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera in units of digital data number ( dn ) per second . using data from june 2010 to september 2012 , the authors selected the flares that were recorded by goes and",
    "simultaneously were observed with one or both stereo spacecraft and found an empirical relation between the observed goes 18    peak fluxes and the calculated euvi 195    full - disk dn output . using this relation",
    ", one can estimate the goes peak x - ray flux of sufficiently intense backside flares observed only by stereo .",
    "presented a list of 16 such major far - side flares detected with this procedure .    in the present paper , we propose a somewhat simpler technique for estimations of the x - ray class of stereo flares .",
    "the technique is based on the measurements of the length of a bright artifact saturation streak , which appears in the euvi 195    images nearly along its east  west axis around the peaks of sufficiently strong flares ( figure  [ f - different_flares ] ) .",
    "such a streak is a consequence of the so - called blooming , _",
    "i.e. _ , saturation of ccd cells , corresponding to the brightest part of a flare source , and spilling of excessive electrons from these cells along ccd columns ( see ) .",
    "similar overexposure effects occur also in the _ extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( eit ; ) images gathered with soho ( _ e.g. _ , ) and in the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ; ) images obtained with sdo @xcite .",
    "( see also table  [ t - goes_stereo]).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    henceforth we will refer to the blooming streaks as b - streaks .",
    "the b - streaks affect the images of flare cores around the peak time .",
    "these sources and moments are most interesting physically .",
    "the b - streaks are considered usually as a serious interference for the image processing and studies .",
    "our analysis shows however that b - streaks contain useful information about the flare importance and the brightest euv sources in general .",
    "this idea is based on the fact that the larger emission flux produces the stronger blooming in ccd cells , and therefore a longer b - streak is formed ( see figure  [ f - different_flares ] ) . in the next section  [ s - approach ] , we describe our approach and data selected for the analysis .",
    "section  [ s - relations ] is devoted to strong flares observed with both goes and one or two stereo spacecraft .",
    "these concurrent observations allowed us to obtain an empirical relation between the relative lengths of b - streaks and the sxr fluxes ( _ i.e. _ , the goes classes ) of the stereo flares . in section  [ s - strong_flares ] , we present illustrations and a list of major backside flares ( mainly above the m3.0 class ) , registered by stereo spacecraft in 20072014 .",
    "we also compare the sxr classes of far - side flares evaluated by , using the calculated dn fluxes in the euvi 195    channel , and those estimated with our technique .",
    "the paper ends in section  [ s - summary ] with a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "in order to judge to what extent b - streaks are suitable for an assessment of the sxr class of backside flares , it is necessary to analyze the relationship between these parameters for coincident flares observed simultaneously with goes and one or both stereo spacecraft . proceeding from the stereo trajectories , it is clear that initially the number of such coincident flares was large , but then gradually decreased . after february 2011 , when the two stereo spacecraft were in the near - quadrature configuration relative to the sun ",
    "earth line , only those flares were observed both with goes and one of the stereo probes that were sufficiently removed from the central meridian visible from earth . in 2013 and 2014 , only near - the - limb flares , from the earth view , could be observed with goes and one of the stereo spacecraft ; the west- and east - limb goes flares were observed with a and b stations , respectively .    we have analyzed",
    "the noaa goes flare list up to july 2014 , _",
    "i.e. _ , during the ascent and maximum phases of solar cycle 24 , ( ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/space-weather/solar-data/solar-features/solar-flares/x-rays/goes/ ) and selected for further analysis practically all coincident flares above the m1.0 class .",
    "the exceptions were a small number of flares overlapping in time , but occurring in different active regions ; flares with obvious partial limb occultation for either stereo or goes ; and some m1m2 flares , in which a relatively short b - steak was not discernible against extended pre - existing structures .",
    "in addition to strong flares , a certain amount of c - class flares with a visible b - streak was randomly chosen to be included in our analysis .",
    "we considered these events to reveal more clearly the tendency of the increasing length of the euv b - streak with an increasing sxr flare importance .",
    "for the considerations of b - streaks we used euvi images in the 195    channel , which encompasses the fe  xii line with a peak temperature of @xmath9  mk , because these images were produced mostly every 5 min ( sometimes the cadence was 2.5 or 10 min ) .",
    "more importantly , this channel has some sensitivity to the emission of high - temperature plasma due to the secondary peak around 15  mk in the fe  xxiv line at 192    that makes the 195  channel the closest analog of the sxr goes monitors ( see ) . as the main quantitative parameter characterizing b - streaks , we took its maximum length , @xmath10 , measured in fractions of the solar radius , @xmath11 , in the same euvi image , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath12 ratio .",
    "as will be shown later , the length of a b - streak can considerably exceed @xmath13 in major flares .",
    "we endeavored to develop a method , which would be as simple as possible .",
    "for this reason , we did not analyze the source fits files , and used instead the euvi 195    images in jpeg and movies in mpeg , which are available at http://stereo - ssc.nascom.nasa.gov / browse/. they are already processed with the standard solarsoft routine secchi_prep.pro , and rotated so that solar north is up . in spite of their non - linear brightness scale ,",
    "most b - streaks are clearly discernible in the @xmath14 movies .",
    "we also use the @xmath15 images to measure the b - streak length , especially for weak flares .",
    "the observed b - streak length is expected to depend on the exposure time , @xmath16 . for each image ,",
    "information on @xmath16 can be found at http://sharpp.nrl.navy.mil/cgi-bin/swdbi/secchi_flight/img_short/form , using the full - page output .",
    "it turned out that more often the euvi telescopes operated with @xmath17  s. the 16  s exposure time was almost regularly used in early observations until january 2010 .",
    "later on , @xmath18  s had only the images recorded every even hour at the 16th minute , _ i.e. _ , at 00:16 , 02:16 , 04:16 , and so on ( _ all times hereafter refer to ut _ ) .",
    "we corrected all the considered images to @xmath17  s. namely , if the longest b - streak occurred in an image with @xmath18  s , we halved its length and compared it with b - streaks in adjacent images .",
    "we then excluded flares ( mainly of c - class ) in which after such a correction the maximum relative length of b - streaks , @xmath12 , was less than 0.1 .",
    "the reason is that short b - streaks in such events could become visible against the background of other flare structures just because @xmath18  s.    .extraction from the list of flares registered both with goes and stereo ( see section  [ s - approach ] ) .",
    "asterisks mark the events in which the correction for an exposure time of 8  s was applied . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the sxr fluxes ( goes classes ) of such backside flares were estimated from the relative lengths @xmath12 of the longest b - streaks using equation ( [ e - regression ] ) .",
    "we restricted ourselves to flares with @xmath19 , which corresponds to the goes class of @xmath20  m4.0 .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ t - strong_flares ] , where for each of the detected events the following information is listed : the date ( column 1 ) ; time of the longest b - streak ( 2 ) ; the stereo a or b probe , in whose images the streak was measured ( 3 ) ; approximate coordinates of the flare ( 4 ) ; the noaa number of active region ( 5 ) assigned before its disappearance behind the west limb ( mainly for a - probe ) or after its appearance at the east limb ( mainly for b - probe ) ; the value of the @xmath12 parameter ( 6 ) ; the estimated peak sxr flux in units of @xmath21  w  m@xmath8 ( 7 ) , and the flare goes class ( 8) . in accordance with the small statistical errors of the parameters found in evaluating equation ( [ e - regression ] ) , the 95% confidence interval of the estimated flare class is rather narrow for short b - streaks and broadens gradually with an increase of @xmath12 .",
    "for example , the confidence interval is m2.6m4.7 for an m3.5 flare and x10x18 for an x13 flare .",
    "column 9 of table  [ t - strong_flares ] presents probable ranges of the goes classes for major far - side flares of 20102012 estimated by from the calculated total dn output .",
    "we included all of the 16 backside flares listed by the authors , although three of these flares had @xmath22 . in two of these events ( 2011 - 03 - 21 , 02:11 and 2011 - 11 - 03 , 22:41 ) , the longest b - streaks were even shorter , @xmath23 , but their blooming consisted of many elements , that is typical for lde flares associated with large cmes .",
    "the third flare of 2012 - 07 - 23 , 02:36 with @xmath24 is particularly noteworthy and will be discussed below . as table  [ t - strong_flares ] shows , our analysis of euvi b - streaks revealed 63 far - side flares above the m4.0 level , including 22 x - class flares , in addition to 94 and 28 flares of the same classes registered by goes during the ascending and maximum phases of the current solar cycle ( until september 2014 ) .",
    "table  [ t - strong_flares ] demonstrates that our estimations of the goes classes for 13 other major backside flares listed by are close to their results as well . in the majority of cases ,",
    "our estimated goes importance falls within the range specified by these authors .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    figure  [ f - major_flares ] illustrates b - streaks in six of the strongest backside flares observed by stereo / euvi . shown in figure  [",
    "f - major_flares]c is the 2012 - 09 - 20 flare with the longest b - streak exceeding the solar diameter ; in this case @xmath25 that corresponds to the estimated sxr class of x13 .",
    "this event turned out to be not only the most powerful far - side flare but the strongest flare of the solar cycle 24 until the present time .",
    "this conclusion and evaluation of the flare class are consistent with the results of obtained through the calculations of the full - disk euvi total dn output . with an example of this event",
    ", we can demonstrate that b - streaks allow not only to estimate the sxr importance of large lde flares but also to reconstruct their probable time history .",
    "for this purpose , it is sufficient to have visible b - streaks in several images , to measure their largest relative length , and to calculate the sxr flux using equation ( [ e - regression ] ) . as figure  [ f - time_profiles]a shows , the b - streaks in the 2012 - 09 - 20 event are clearly visible , at least , in eight frames of the 5-min cadence . at the growth phase",
    ", a long b - streak appears very sharply .",
    "the shape of the time profile indicates that the maximum flux occurred between two frames of 14:56 and 15:01 .",
    "this suggests that the sxr class of this flare was still higher than the longest b - streak implies and seems to be about x20 .    ) .",
    "the crosses with the right arrows correspond to the images in which b - streaks are not yet visible .",
    "the dashed lines represent a possible ascending part of the time profiles .",
    "the open square in panel ( b ) refers to an image corrected for an exposure time of 8  s.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    two other far - side events induced interest as sources of outstanding space weather disturbances .",
    "the 2012 - 07 - 23 flare mentioned above is widely debated and considered as an utmost extreme eruptive event ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ) .",
    "the corresponding interplanetary cme ( icme ) arrived at stereo - a , which was located favorably , in a very short transit time of 1921  hr and brought to 1  au a record strong interplanetary magnetic field of 109  nt .",
    "if directed toward earth , this icme might cause a geomagnetic storm comparable to the famous carrington storm of 1859 .",
    "meanwhile , the corresponding flare was fairly moderate ; estimated its soft x - class to be in the m8.2x2.5 range , and our estimation from the observed b - streak length leads to even lower values of about m5.4 .",
    "the researchers of this event suggested that the extreme characteristics of the event were caused by a high initial cme speed ( up to 3000  km  s@xmath26 ) , week icme drag deceleration in the solar wind determined by preceding solar eruptions , and by an enhancement of the magnetic field due to an interaction between two cmes , which closely followed each other .",
    "currently we are working on an alternative interpretation suggesting that the extremely high speed of cme / icme and its strong interplanetary magnetic field were due to a large eruptive magnetic flux and a weak icme expansion in propagation from the sun to 1 au , in accordance with patterns described by and .",
    "the magnetic flux was estimated from the sdo / hmi magnetogram on 2012 - 07 - 12 , when the parent active region was located near the center of the visible disk .",
    "the 2014 - 01 - 06 , 07:56 flare occurred at a heliolongitude of w113 and produced a 2.5% ground - level enhancement ( gle ) of cosmic rays , only the second one in the unusual solar cycle 24 . analyzed this proton event and kinematics of an accompanying cme and came to a conclusion that it was consistent with a particle acceleration by a cme - driven shock .",
    "on the other hand , a sufficiently long ( @xmath27 ) multi - element b - streak existed in stereo - a images for nearly one hour during this flare . a probable time history presented in figure  [ f - time_profiles]b demonstrates that the flare was a powerful lde of @xmath28  x2 class . according to",
    ", an x2 class flare can well be associated with a source of sep with proton fluxes of j(@xmath29 mev ) @xmath30 pfu , j(@xmath31 mev ) @xmath32 pfu , and gle of @xmath33 that are close to the observations .",
    "these parameters estimated from b - streaks are typical of flares related to small gles .",
    "we have demonstrated how a spurious instrumental effect , which strongly interferes solar flare imaging , can be used to obtain a useful information .",
    "here we were dealing with the so - called blooming , arising from a significant saturation of the stereo / euvi 195    images in ccd cells corresponding to the cores of sufficiently strong flares .",
    "the saturated ccd cells lose their ability to accommodate any additional charge , causing them to spill over adjacent cells . as a result , one or several bright nearly horizontal streaks ( b - streaks ) are formed .",
    "we have shown that in spite of many unaccounted factors , the maximum relative length of the euv b - streak , @xmath12 , correlates with the peak flare sxr flux , @xmath34 , measured by goes .",
    "we have analyzed about 350 flares of 20072014 which were observed simultaneously by goes and one of stereo spacecraft , and found an empirical relation between @xmath12 and @xmath34 .",
    "this allowed us to propose a simple and prompt method for estimating the sxr class of far - side flares observed with stereo but invisible for goes .",
    "the method consists of a direct measurement of the length of the longest b - streak in units of the solar radius in the routine euvi 195    images or movies , accessible in near real time at http://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/browse/ , and the use of equation ( [ e - regression ] ) .",
    "it is necessary only to make sure that all the measurements were converted to the exposure time of 8  s. prior to this , proposed a somewhat more laborious method for estimations of the sxr flux and class of far - side flares based on calculations of the euvi full - disk total digital number output .",
    "it should be noted that if there is a temporal overlap between the flares in different active regions , then our method makes it possible to measure their b - streaks and to estimate their classes independent of each other .    applying our method to the stereo observations during the ascending and maximum phases of solar cycle 24 allowed us to find about 65 major backside flares with the euvi b - streak lengths of @xmath19 and to estimate their sxr fluxes and classes . for the majority of 16 backside flares listed by for 20102012 , our estimations are close to their results . among these events ,",
    "the 2012 - 09 - 20 flare turned out to be the strongest one in the current solar cycle .",
    "its probable importance of about x13 was estimated from @xmath35 .",
    "we also briefly discussed two far - side events of interest for space weather .",
    "the 2012 - 07 - 23 eruption occurred in an active region with a large magnetic flux and under favorable location relative to the earth could be a source of an extremely strong and prompt geomagnetic storm . judging from the b - streak ,",
    "the west behind - the - limb flare of 2014 - 01 - 06 was sufficiently intense and long - lasting to be connected with a source of the observed proton event including gle .",
    "using the two lde events as examples , we have demonstrated that by measuring the maximum b - streak length in a number of consecutive images one can reconstruct a probable time history of a flare .",
    "it is clear that these and other features found due to b - streaks require further detailed study .",
    "hopefully , the proposed simple method of prompt estimations of the sxr class of the far - side stereo flares from artifact b - streaks would be useful for solar studies and solar - terrestrial forecasting .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for constructive comments , which helped us to improve the manuscript .",
    "the authors thank the goes and stereo teams for their open data used in our study .",
