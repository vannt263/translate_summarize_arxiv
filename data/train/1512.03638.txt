    "<S> indeed , the last years have witnessed an intense theoretical activity aiming at understanding the actual nature of this state . </S>",
    "<S> what is still missing , however , is a simultaneous study of the two reactions analysed by besiii and mentioned above in which the @xmath5 structure has been seen . can not be simply kinematical effects . despite the importance , a detailed global analysis of the data for both reactions using fully resummed and unitarized amplitudes has not been done before . ] </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this work is to perform such a study , and , from it , to extract information about this seemingly resonant intriguing structure </S>",
    "<S> . we will first settle a @xmath3 , @xmath4 coupled channel formalism , considering that the @xmath5 emerges from the @xmath3 interaction , and that its coupling to @xmath4 proceeds through the former intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath23-matrix will enter the calculation of the amplitudes for the reactions @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the @xmath25 state is dominantly a @xmath26 bound state @xcite and use the ideas of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> let us denote with 1 and 2 the @xmath27 and @xmath3 channels , respectively , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( here and below , the @xmath30-parity refers to the neutral member of the isospin triplet ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled - channel @xmath23-matrix can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the loop function diagonal matrix , and the matrix elements of the potential read @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the the @xmath35th particle in the channel @xmath36 , and the mass factors are included to account for the non - relativistic normalization of the heavy meson fields . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath37 interaction strength is known to be tiny  @xcite , and we neglect the direct coupling of this channel , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> such a treatment was also done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath39 states . for the inelastic @xmath40 @xmath7-wave interaction </S>",

    "<S> the lowest order contact potential for the @xmath42 transition is simply a constant as well , denoted by @xmath43  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can be shown that even with two coupled channels , no resonance can be generated in the complex plane above threshold with only constant potentials . to that end </S>",

    "<S> for definiteness , we set @xmath58 , although the specific value is not very relevant as we have checked since changes in the cut - off can be reabsorbed in the strength of the transition potential controlled by the undertermined @xmath59 low energy constant . with this convention for the regulator , </S>",
    "<S> the loop functions in the matrix @xmath32 read @xmath60 with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62 channel loop function @xmath63 is computed in the non - relativistic approximation .    for the @xmath17 annihilations at the @xmath25 mass , </S>",
    "<S> both besiii and belle have reported the @xmath5 structure in the @xmath4 final state @xcite , but only besiii provides data for the @xmath3 channel  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> width into the calculation of @xmath99 only leads to a change of about 3%  @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum for both reactions can be obtained as a contribution from the amplitudes ( @xmath100 ) plus a background ( @xmath101 ) : @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the limits of the @xmath83 mandelstam variables for the decay mode @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> , this pole would move into the real axis in the unphysical riemann sheet of the elastic amplitude @xmath145 . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , the obtained pole does not qualify as a resonance , and we see it as a virtual or anti - bound @xmath8 state . </S>",
    "<S> it does not correspond to a particle in the sense that its wave function , unlike that of a bound state , is not localized . </S>",
    "<S> however , it produces observable effects at the @xmath62 threshold similar to those produced by a near threshold resonance or bound state . </S>",
    "<S> nucleon - nucleon waves there appears the deuteron , a truly bound state , with real existence ( one can prepare a target or a beam made up of this particle ) , while in the singlet @xmath146 wave there is a virtual state , which has not real existence in this sense . ] indeed , scattering experiments alone , in principle , can not distinguish between virtual and bound states , but the difference is not a purely academic one since they can produce different line shapes in inelastic open channels  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the line shapes of a virtual state and a near - threshold resonance are different since the former is peaked exactly at the threshold while the latter , in principle , is above . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in the left bottom panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bothexpcomparison ] where the @xmath147 spectrum for the two fits @xmath132 and @xmath148 are shown ( for the case @xmath133 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the two curves are different , each one would approximately lie within the error band of the other . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , very precise data with a good energy resolution and small bin size are necessary to distinguish among them .    without taking sides , and given that both natures for the @xmath5 structure ( resonance or virtual state ) arise in fits of good quality , it must be stated that the experimental information available at this time can not fully discriminate between both scenarios and , hence , claims about the @xmath5 structure should be made with caution . nevertheless , the resonance scenario seems to be statistically slightly preferred . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that more experimental information is needed to elaborate on the nature of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the spectrum of @xmath4 with narrower bins would be highly desirable to have a good resolution on its line shape . if it is finally shown to be a virtual state </S>",
    "<S> , then it can not be a tetraquark , since it does not correspond to a normal particle , and it can only have a hadronic molecular nature , in the sense that it appears only because of the @xmath8 interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , we have studied the two decays ( @xmath149 ) in which the @xmath150 resonant - like structure is seen . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented the first simultaneous study of the invariant mass distributions of the @xmath27 and @xmath3 channels with fully unitarized amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these data sets are well reproduced in two different scenarios . in the first one , </S>",
    "<S> in which there is an energy dependence in the @xmath151 potential , the @xmath5 appears as a dynamically generated @xmath3 resonance . in the second one </S>",
    "<S> , however , when the aforementioned energy dependence is not allowed , it appears as a virtual state , with the pole located below the @xmath8 threshold . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , it is demonstrated that both data sets can be reproduced with only one @xmath5 state , so that the two experimentally observed structures @xmath9 and @xmath152 , in different channels , are proven to correspond to the same state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , both fits do not allow a @xmath6 bound state solution . are neglected . ] since the virtual state can only be of hadronic - molecule type , it is really important to discriminate between these two scenarios . for that purpose </S>",
    "<S> , one needs a very precise measurement of the line shapes around , in particular slightly above , the @xmath8 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> such a measurement is foreseen when more data are collected at besiii . </S>"
