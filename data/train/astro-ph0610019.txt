    "sharpless 2 - 216 ( sh2 - 216 ) has been discovered as a `` curious emission - line nebula '' @xcite . at a distance of @xmath0 @xcite ,",
    "it is the closest possible planetary nebula ( pn ) known with an apparent diameter of @xmath1 .",
    "sh2 - 216 has experienced a mild interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ; * ? ? ? * ) . from its distance and proper motion , @xcite",
    "have determined that it has a thin - disk orbit of low inclination and eccentricity .",
    "lsv+4621 has been identified as the exciting star of sh2 - 216 by proper motion measurements @xcite . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that lsv+4621 , which is the brightest ( @xmath2 ) dao white dwarf ( wd0439 + 466 ) known , has the properties ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( cgs ) , @xmath5 by number ) to ionize the surrounding nebula .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have reported that a problem ( blp ) exists to reproduce lines of the balmer series ( with nlte model atmospheres ) simultaneously at a given @xmath6 in hot da white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite found ( in lte calculations for dao wds ) that the blp is reduced by the consideration of metal - line blanketing , and @xcite could show clearly that the presence of heavy metals is the source of the blp  in other words , pure hydrogen models are not well suited for the spectral analysis of hot da wds in general .",
    "@xcite calculated nlte model atmospheres for lsv+4621 based on parameters of @xcite and introduced c , n , and o ( at solar abundances ) in addition .",
    "surface cooling by these metals as well as the detailed consideration of the stark line broadening in the model - atmosphere calculation has the effect that the blp almost vanishes in lsv+4621 .",
    "later , @xcite could demonstrate that these model atmospheres reproduce well hut ( hopkins ultraviolet telescope ) observations of lsv+4621 within @xmath7 at @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "spectral analysis by model - atmosphere techniques needs observations of lines of subsequent ionization stages in order to evaluate the ionization equilibrium ( of a particular species ) which is a sensitive indicator of @xmath6 .",
    "since stars with @xmath6 as high as @xmath10 have their flux maximum in the euv wavelength range and due to the high degree of ionization , most of the metal lines are found in the uv range .",
    "thus , high - s / n and high - resolution uv spectra are a prerequisite for a precise analysis . consequently , we employed hst / stis ( space telescope imaging spectrograph aboard the hubble space telescope ) and fuse ( far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ) in order to obtain suitable data .    a stis spectrum ( @xmath11 , exposure time 5.5ksec , resolution = 0.06 ) was taken in 2000 and was processed by the standard pipeline data reduction . a fuse observation ( @xmath12 , 67.6ksec , 0.05 ) was performed in 2003/2004 and reduced by j.w.k .",
    "( feb 2005 ) .",
    "for the evolution of lsv+4621 standard evolutionary models for hydrogen - rich post - agb stars , e.g. @xcite and @xcite are appropriate .",
    "recently , new evolutionary calculations for da wds with a thin hydrogen envelope have been presented by @xcite .",
    "these evolutionary calculations are used to compare with and to determine stellar masses , luminosities , and post - agb ages ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the plane - parallel , static , and chemically homogeneous models used in this analysis are calculated with tmap , the tbingen nlte model atmosphere package @xcite .",
    "h+he+c+n+o+mg+si are considered with `` classical '' model atoms ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    ". for ca+sc+ti+v+cr+mn+fe+co+ni individual model atoms are constructed by ironic @xcite , using a statistical approach in order to treat the overwhelmingly large number of atomic levels and line transitions by the introduction of `` super - levels '' and `` super - lines '' . in total 531 levels",
    "are treated in nlte , combined with 1761 individual lines and about 9 million iron - group lines , taken from @xcite as well as from the opacity and iron projects @xcite .",
    "=      =    the stis spectrum has a very good s / n ( @xmath13 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ident ] ) and allows to identify about 95% of all spectral features ( photospheric as well as interstellar absorptions ) .",
    "we were able to identify some lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ident ] ) , which allow to use the / ionization equilibrium ( sect .",
    "[ sect : obs ] ) for our analysis ( cf .",
    "moreover , we could identify lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ident ] )  up to our knowledge  for the first time in these objects ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from a detailed comparison of ly@xmath14 with the observation",
    ", we determined @xmath15 .",
    "given this value , the galactic reddening law of @xcite yields @xmath16 .",
    "we achieve the best match to the continuum slope with @xmath17 .",
    "this is in agreement with the result of @xmath18 that @xcite derived from the analysis of a hut spectrum .",
    "we determined a photospheric radial velocity of @xmath19 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 measured from iue ( international ultraviolet explorer ) spectra by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "such a large difference is possible if the object has not been located in the middle of the iue aperture ( holberg priv .",
    "the higher @xmath22 will have some influence on the calculation of the galactic orbit of lsv+4621 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : history ] ) and hence , investigation on the interaction of sh2 - 216 with the ism .    as an example for the spectral analysis , we have selected a section between 1330 and 1137  in order to demonstrate that we can fit , , and lines simultaneously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teff ] ) .",
    "because of the sensitivity of the ionization balance , this allows to determine @xmath6 within very small error limits .",
    "=    the fuse spectrum of lsv+4621 is heavily contaminated by interstellar absorption features ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fuse ] ) .",
    "our final model fits to the observation at wavelengths @xmath23 better with a higher reddening ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "some of this difference in continuum slope can be explained by the interstellar h@xmath24 opacity , but an increase in the interstellar extinction appears to be necessary .    the analysis of the fuse spectrum and an investigation on the interstellar absorption is presented in more detail by ( * ? ? ? * and these proceedings ) .",
    "from the  ,  ,  , and  ionization equilibria , we were able to determine @xmath25 with  for these objects  unprecedented precision . since this is a prerequisite for reliable abundance determinations , their error limits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] ) are also relatively small .",
    "the formerly determined surface gravity of @xmath9 @xcite has been confirmed .    =    the derived abundance pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] ) gives evidence for an interplay of gravitational settling ( e.g. the he and c abundances are strongly decreased by a factor of @xmath26 ) and radiative levitation ( iron - group elements show an up to @xmath27 solar increased abundance ) .    in our metal - line blanketed nlte model atmospheres which include the opacity of 16 species from h to ni ( sect .  [ sect : analysis ] ) , the blp ( sect .",
    "[ sect : blp ] ) vanishes in the available medium - resolution optical spectra ( at @xmath28 )  now adequate high - resolution and high - s / n optical spectra are desirable in order to investigate if there are still remaining problems .",
    "the reddening of @xmath17 towards lsv+4621 is much higher than expected from the galactic reddening law ( sect .",
    "[ subsect : stis ] ) possibly because of additional reddening due to dust in the nebula sh2 - 216 .",
    "state - of - the - art nlte spectral analysis has arrived at a high level of sophistication .",
    "however , it is hampered by the lack of reliable atomic data for metal lines .",
    "we are able to identify / reproduce about 95% of all spectral lines in the stis spectrum of lsv+4621 and it is likely that unidentified lines ( e.g. in figs .",
    "[ fig : ident ] , [ fig : teff ] ) simply stem from the most prominent ions as well , but their wavelengths are not sufficiently well known .",
    "e.g. for , @xcite provides only 22 laboratory measured ( pos ) lines and 1952 lines with theoretical line positions ( lin lines ) .",
    "this situation is even worse for other ions (: 224 and 58664 , respectively ) and species .",
    "thus , it should be a challenge for atomic physics to provide properly measured atomic data ( also for highly ionized elements ) which will then strongly improve future spectral analyses .",
