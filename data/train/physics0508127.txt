    "photonic crystal ( pc ) @xcite coupled cavity waveguides ( ccws ) @xcite , which are formed by series of coupled point defects in otherwise perfect pcs , have been investigated intensively using tight binding ( tb ) theory in the last several years @xcite , and the propagation mechanism of hopping between neighboring cavities has been clearly understood @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "a periodic ccw possesses a continuous transmission band of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the eigenfrequency of an individual cavity and @xmath2 , @xmath3 are two related overlap integrals @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "the modes of the continuous band derived from tb theory are called _ tb - modes _ in this paper .",
    "many potential applications , such as broadband dropping @xcite , broadband splitting @xcite , broadband optical switching and limiting @xcite , and ultrashort pulse transmission @xcite are all based on the continuous transmission bands ( tb - modes ) .    in practice , however , the number of the cavity @xmath4 is finite , and born - von karman periodic condition is used @xcite and @xmath4 _ discrete _ modes are obtained , which satisfy the dispersion relation of @xcite : @xmath5\\\\    & & \\mbox{with } k_m=2m\\pi / l,\\quad m=0,\\cdots , n-1\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the distance between two neighboring cavities , and @xmath7 is the total length of the system . when the coupling strength between the cavities are designed carefully , and some criteria are satisfied@xcite ,",
    "a quasi - flat spectrum with @xmath4 small dips formed by the @xmath4 discrete modes may be obtained@xcite .",
    "actually , the broadband operations mentioned above @xcite are all realized using the quasi - flat transmission band .",
    "is represented by @xmath8 . where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are three different kinds of medium layers with refractive indexes of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and physical thicknesses of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the layer @xmath18 is the same as layer @xmath9 except that the thickness is @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a reference wavelength . ]    on the other hand , one can also design a @xmath4-cavity ccw to make the @xmath4 modes _ _ separated completely__@xcite , ( these separated modes are called supermodes in this paper and the reasons are given below ) , rather than to form a quasi - flat band .",
    "we find that the predictions of tb theory become inexact ( as shown below ) in this case .",
    "although the supermodes of a @xmath4-cavity system have been noticed early@xcite , the properties of them are not investigated intensively ( such as the mode profiles and linewidths of each supermodes ) , which prevents them from wide application .    according to the criterion developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one dimensional ( 1d ) ccw with discrete supermodes is designed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccowab ] .",
    "although some numerical methods , such as the finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) @xcite , transfer matrix @xcite can be used to extract the properties we expected , we prefer to understand them from the viewpoint of physics and express them in analysis and simple formulas .    in this paper , a general coupled mode theory is presented to analysis the supermodes of @xmath4-cavity ccw systems , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccowab ] .",
    "the eigenfrequencies , including both the central frequencies and the corresponding linewidths ( and also the quality factors ) , as well as the mode profiles of the supermodes are obtained , and agree well with `` exact '' numerical results ( obtained using standard transfer matrix method ) .",
    "subsequently , these properties of supermodes are used directly to design a potential application of multichannel bistable switchings in the whole c - band . using the results of coupled mode theory , we prove that the thresholds of the multichannel switchings are low and uniform when kerr media are carefully introduced into the cavities .",
    "in the coupled mode theory presented in this paper , the electric field @xmath21 of the entire coupled cavity system is expressed as a linear superposition of the modes of the @xmath4 cavities : @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 are complex coefficients that determine the relative phase and amplitude of the cavities . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the fields of the entire coupled system and those of individual cavities centered at @xmath27 respectively .",

    "we normalize @xmath31 to be unity according to @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the dielectric function of an individual cavity .",
    "( [ eq : sumecmt ] ) is very similar to the linear superposition field used in tb theory , which reads @xcite : @xmath34 where the superposition coefficients are @xmath35 .",
    "however , one may find great differences between them .",
    "in tb theory ( eq.([eq : sumetb ] ) ) , the superposition coefficients are @xmath35 , which have the same modulars of @xmath36 for all the cases of @xmath37 from @xmath38 to @xmath4 , and the relative phases between them are also determined . however , in eq.([eq : sumecmt ] ) , the coefficients of @xmath23 are arbitrary complexes , and the amplitudes and phases of them may be greatly different for various of @xmath37 .",
    "this is one of the most important differences between supermodes and tb - modes .",
    "substituting eq.([eq : sumecmt ] ) into the simplified form of maxwell s equations of : @xmath39 then , we operate both sides of the resulting equation from left using the operator of @xmath40 , one can obtain a group of coupled equations : @xmath41 where the coefficients @xmath42 are defined as    @xmath43    .",
