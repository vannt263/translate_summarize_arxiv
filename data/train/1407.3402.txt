    "magnons are commonly viewed as bosonic quasiparticles with integer spin @xmath1 .",
    "this is certainly true for isotropic ferromagnets , which were originally treated by felix bloch in his seminal paper .",
    "@xcite in the isotropic case the total spin ( magnetization ) is conserved and magnon interaction in an isotropic ferromagnet amounts to simple particle - particle scattering or four - magnon processes .",
    "@xcite in the presence of magnetic anisotropy , _",
    "e.g. _ , dipolar or single - ion , the total spin is no longer conserved and definite spin of a magnon ceases to exist as well . as a result",
    ", additional three - particle interaction terms appear in the magnon hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite spin waves in antiferromagnets have no definite value of @xmath2 even in the isotropic case since the quantum ground state is now a superposition of states with different total spins .",
    "@xcite still three - magnon processes appear only in noncollinear antiferromagnetic structures with completely broken spin - rotational symmetry , @xcite whereas magnon - magnon interactions in collinear antiferromagnets are represented by particle non - conserving four - magnon processes .",
    "@xcite    a special role of three - magnon dipolar processes for spin relaxation in ferromagnets was recognized already in the early works .",
    "@xcite besides that three - particle processes may produce a spectacular quantum effect : spontaneous magnon decay , which leads to a finite magnon lifetime even at @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite theoretical predictions of spontaneous magnon decay were made for dipolar ferromagnets , @xcite for easy - plane ferromagnets , @xcite and various noncollinear antiferromagnets , see literature cited in ref .",
    "at the moment there are only a few experimental evidences of spontaneous magnon decay .",
    "@xcite therefore , a natural question to ask theoretically is what are the physical conditions that can enhance the magnon decay rate . in the present work we focus on the role of low dimensionality in the magnon decay and",
    "specifically consider whether the decay rate is enhanced in the quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometry .",
    "this question was previously studied in the context of quantum disordered magnets , @xcite but has not so far been investigated for ordered magnetic systems .",
    "our study is motivated , in part , by a prominent example of quasi-1d easy - plane ferromagnet @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite we investigate the feasibility of observation of spontaneous magnon decays in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on this material .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the spin model and give necessary details of the @xmath5 spin - wave expansion . sections  iii and iv are devoted to the discussion of the magnon damping in the quasi-1d and the 3d case , respectively .",
    "section  v considers the case of a weak antiferromagnetic coupling between ferromagnetic chains and sec .",
    "vi gives our conclusions .",
    "we consider a heisenberg ferromagnet with the easy - plane single - ion anisotropy described by the spin hamiltonian @xmath6 the nearest - neighbor exchange interactions consist of coupling @xmath7 along chains parallel to the @xmath8-axis and inter - chain coupling @xmath9 . without loss of generality , we consider a square - type arrangement of chains in the @xmath10@xmath11 plane , see fig .",
    "the choice @xmath12 corresponds to a 3d ferromagnet , @xmath13to a quasi-1d magnet , whereas for @xmath14 a quasi-2d case is recovered .",
    "quasi-1d ferromagnetic material csnif@xmath0 has a significant easy - plane anisotropy with @xmath15.@xcite motivated by this experimental example we fix in the following @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the largest of the two exchange constants @xmath18 .",
    "since we are interested in the behavior of high - energy magnons with @xmath19 we are justified to neglect the much weaker dipolar interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "we investigate the transverse field geometry with external field applied along the hard axis and the ferromagnetic magnetization tilted from the easy plane by angle @xmath20 : @xmath21 above the critical field @xmath22 the ordered moments become completely aligned with the hard axis .",
    "note , that the critical field does not depend on the ferromagnetic exchanges in ( [ hfm ] ) . as a result",
    ", the strength of the three - magnon vertex stays remains unchanged under variation of @xmath23 , see eq .",
    "below , and the magnon damping at fixed @xmath24 solely depends on the magnon dispersion @xmath25 and its dimensionality .    to study excitations in the model",
    "we use the transformation from spins to bosons introduced by holstein and primakoff . @xcite as usually , the holstein - primakoff transformation is applied in the local frame such that the local @xmath8-axis is collinear with a spin on a given site . after performing a few standard steps @xcite including expansion of square roots and subsequent fourier and bogolyubov transformations of magnon operators",
    "one obtains a spin - wave hamiltonian structured in powers of @xmath5 : @xmath26 + ... \\label{hh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the magnon energy is @xmath27 , the three - particle ( cubic ) vertex responsible for spontaneous decays is @xmath28 and ellipsis stand for the higher order terms .",

    "the magnon decay rate is given by the imaginary part of the self - energy diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ dia ] and coincides with the fermi s golden - rule expression : @xmath41        the two - magnon decay processes for easy - plane ferromagnets were theoretically studied in refs .",
    "their appearance is determined by two conditions:@xcite ( i ) presence of the cubic vertex in the magnon hamiltonian , which is a direct consequence of the fully broken spin - rotational symmetry for a state with tilted magnetization , and ( ii ) fulfillment of the energy conservation condition for the two - magnon decays : @xmath42 where the harmonic magnon energy can be safely used due to smallness of quantum effects in ferromagnets .",
    "the same kinematic conditions allow also three - magnon decays , which are present in an easy - plane ferromagnet already in zero field .",
    "@xcite the amplitude of these processes is , however , rather small as they correspond to higher - order @xmath5 terms of the spin - wave expansion and we shall not consider them in the following .    since the cubic vertex depends only on @xmath43 and @xmath24 , the effect of dimensionality on the magnon decay rate in anisotropic ferromagnet is present only via the varying dispersion @xmath25 .",
    "the two - dimensional case was investigated in detail in our previous work.@xcite in the following sections we calculate the magnon decay rate for quasi-1d and 3d cases .",
    "we begin the analysis of the magnon decay for @xmath44 by treating analytically the case of long - wavelength magnons . in this limit",
    "the decay rate can be calculated perturbatively because of smallness of interaction among low - energy excitations and due to reduction of the phase - space volume available for decay processes .",
    "note that at small momenta @xmath45 , the decay vertex has the standard `` hydrodynamic '' form @xmath46 . as a result , the long - wavelength excitations exhibit a usual 3d asymptote @xmath47 @xmath48 for the decay rate , @xcite because the dispersion @xmath25 is eventually three dimensional .",
    "therefore , the proper question to be addressed analytically is how the coefficient in the @xmath49-law depends on a small parameter @xmath23 .",
    "an analytical derivation of the low - energy asymptote for @xmath47 closely follows a similar computation for 2d or 3d magnetic system with three - particle vertices.@xcite below we present only the essential steps .",

    "however , as we shall see shortly , the region of interest in the quasi-1d case is @xmath56 , which justifies eq .  .",
    "selecting the momentum of an incident magnon on the @xmath8-axis , @xmath57 , we obtain in the same approximation @xmath58 where @xmath59 . substituting into the expression for the decay rate and performing separate integration of @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "we obtain the following long - wavelength asymptote in the quasi-1d case @xmath62 where a dimensionless constant is @xmath63 and @xmath20 is the canting angle . in a 3d case for @xmath7=@xmath9 a similar computation yields",
    "@xcite @xmath64 thus , in the quasi-1d case the damping of acoustic magnons is inversely proportional to a small @xmath9 and is , therefore , parametrically enhanced compared to damping of acoustic magnons in 3d .",
    "we have verified such an enhancement by a direct numerical integration of eq .  .",

    "the curves correspond to three @xmath65 ratios portraying crossover from a strong @xmath68 to a weak @xmath69 quasi one - dimensionality .",
    "the two curves corresponding to @xmath70 exhibit large peaks in @xmath47 near the brillouin zone boundary , which originate from a 1d van hove singularity in the spectrum . a more detailed structure of this peak on the inset illustrates the role of 3d coupling , which cuts off the square - root divergence of the peaks and restores a 3d van hove singularities at the boundary of the decay region and for the saddle points in the continuum .",
    "similar 3d van hove singularities are also prominent for small momenta towards the @xmath67 point .",
    "importantly , the height of the peak in @xmath47 near the @xmath71-point decreases rapidly as the magnon dispersion becomes more and more 3d .",
    "this demonstrates that the decays along @xmath67z direction in the brillouin zone are most prominent for the quasi-1d case .",

    "spontaneous magnon decays for a 2d easy - plane ferromagnet in transverse magnetic field were studied in our previous work .",

    "iii ) and 2d results @xcite one can speculate that the magnon decay in 3d shows no major enhancement and , thus , should be small compared to low dimensional magnets .",
    "to study the magnon damping in 3d we fix the exchange ratio to @xmath80 as an example .",
    "it is instructive to consider in this case magnons with momenta belonging to the cubic diagonal , the @xmath81 direction .",
    "numerical results for @xmath47 along this axis look very similar to fig .",
    "[ figg2 ] including a surprisingly high peak near the a point .",
    "a zoom into this region is shown in fig .",
    "[ figg3 ] for different values of an applied magnetic field . the overall shape of numerical data is qualitatively similar to the results shown on the inset of fig .",
    "[ figg2 ] for the quasi-1d case .",
    "the peak in @xmath47 is most prominent for @xmath82 , while at smaller fields it is much less pronounced .",
    "the arrows show the magnon decay boundaries , obtained from the kinematic condition @xmath83 , see further details in ref .",
    "the above fact actually means that the predominant decay channel for a magnon in the vicinity of the damping peak is a decay into two magnons with equal momenta lying on the same cubic diagonal .",
    "with increasing @xmath24 the decay region extends further towards the @xmath84 point , @xmath85 , the two magnons emitted in a decay process become close to @xmath86 .",
    "a remarkable property of the nearest - neighbor magnon dispersion ( [ ek ] ) near @xmath86 is that @xmath25 is almost perfectly flat with the exception of a few special directions .",
    "such an effective dimensionality reduction is responsible for the enhanced two - magnon density of states ( dos ) , which in turn leads to large values of the magnon decay rate .    to check the above scenario for the magnon damping enhancement in 3d case",
    "we calculate the two - magnon dos : @xmath87 at @xmath76 the dos exhibits a delta - peak for @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , in that case the magnon energy ( [ ek ] ) is given by a sum of the cosine harmonics .",

    "@xmath91 where @xmath92 . for @xmath93 ,",
    "we expand @xmath94 in small @xmath95 as follows @xmath96 , \\label{dos2 }   \\\\ & & j_d= j_0 + 2d\\cos^2\\theta\\ , , \\quad a_{\\bf q } = j_\\parallel q_z+ j_\\perp(q_x+q_y)\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dependence of @xmath97 on @xmath33 enters only via a linear combination @xmath98 .",
    "thus , neglecting higher - order terms one finds an effective 1d dispersion of the decay surface @xmath99 . as a result , an integration of the delta - function in eq",
    ".   generates a conventional 1d square - root van hove singularity in the dos : @xmath100 at @xmath76 ( @xmath101 ) the square - root peak transforms into the delta - peak discussed above .",
    "note also , that @xmath102 for @xmath103 with the equality ( signifying a fulfilment of the kinematic decay condition ) reached only at @xmath76 .",
    "the above analytical results for dos can be compared with the direct numerical evaluation of presented in fig .",

    "still , an enhanced dos at the former peak position survives for a range of values of @xmath109 . as an illustration figure  [ figg4 ] shows the numerical result for @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
    "a remnant peak in dos ( mind the logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "[ figg4 ] ) leads to a stronger decay rate @xmath47 once magnetic field approaches @xmath22 and magnons with momenta close to @xmath106 become unstable .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , our study is in a large part motivated by the quasi-1d ferromagnet @xmath4 .",

    "@xcite the collinear order has been explained by a competition between the antiferromagnetic exchange and the long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "@xcite in this section we consider the effect of the sign on an interchain coupling on the magnon decay in quasi-1d chains .",
    "we shall use a simplified model with @xmath122 assuming a tetragonal arrangement of chains and neglecting dipolar interactions . in this model , spin chains",
    "are still ordered ferromagnetically while an ordering between chains is described by the wavevector @xmath123 @xmath124 and corresponds to a two sublattice antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "we again assume that an external magnetic field is oriented along the hard axis .",

    "[ figg2 ] calculated for different values of magnetic field . in particular , high peaks are present near the bz boundary for both lines , @xmath67z and ma .    some differences start to develop for @xmath139 and become quite significant at @xmath140 .",
    "the magnon dispersion between chains becomes more substantial and plays a more prominent role in the energy conservation . as a result , for the ferromagnetic interchain coupling @xmath135 ,",
    "a stronger magnon damping with two characteristic peaks is present for magnons on the ma - line , whereas @xmath47 on the @xmath67z - line is significantly smaller for @xmath141 . for the antiferromagnetic interchain coupling @xmath122",
    ", one can observe an opposite tendency .",
    "in fact , there is a remarkable mirror symmetry between plots on the left and on the right with simultaneous sign change of @xmath9 .",
    "it is related to the fact that the position of the acoustic magnon branch alters its place between @xmath67z- and ma - line with the sign reversal .",
    "overall , most favorable conditions for observing spontaneous magnon decay , _ i.e. _ , large @xmath47 for extended region in the momentum space , are found for @xmath142 , a value close to exchange ratio in @xmath4 .",
    "in summary , magnetic excitations in an easy - plane ferromagnet placed in a transverse magnetic field become intrinsically damped at @xmath3 due to two - magnon decays .",
    "@xcite we have studied the effect of dimensionality on the magnon decay rate for such an ordered magnetic system . for weak interchain coupling",
    "the decay rate @xmath47 is strongest in the vicinity of the brillouin zone boundary exhibiting a peak @xmath143@xmath144 .",
    "such a peak is related to the 1d - like van hove singularity in the two - magnon density of states and its height needs to be compared to the characteristic energy of magnons at the brillouin zone boundary @xmath145 . for @xmath146 and @xmath147 the decay rate is a sizeable fraction of the magnon energy .",
    "therefore , spontaneous magnon decays can be observed in the neutron - scattering experiments as a significant line broadening of the zone boundary magnons . in particular ,",
    "our results for a model system with ferromagnetic spin chains , which are weakly coupled antiferromagnetically , indicate that the spontaneous magnon decay should be prominent in the quasi 1d easy - plane ferromagnet @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite    somewhat surprisingly , we have found a large decay rate @xmath47 also in a 3d case @xmath148 for certain magnon momenta @xmath109 .",
    "the increase in @xmath47 is again rooted in the two - magnon density of states @xmath149 , see eq .  , which develops a peak due to a very weak @xmath33-dependence of the two magnon energy @xmath150 .",
    "the latter property is a consequence of the exchange coupling only between the nearest neighbors .",
    "being a model assumption this property is nevertheless satisfied with good accuracy in many magnetic insulators .",
    "overall , we conclude that lower dimensionality has a pronounced effect on spontaneous magnon decay by means of an enhanced two - magnon dos . in the quasi-1d limit",
    ", the van hove singularities in the dos become largest and correspond to a strong damping of magnons in the vicinity of the decay threshold boundary .",
    "thus , small shift in the @xmath109-space may lead to striking changes in the behavior of the corresponding magnon modes .",
    "our theoretical results call for inelastic neutron - scattering measurements of magnon lifetime in spin - chain materials .",
    "materials with ferromagnetic chains are , especially , suitable for such experiments since the required magnetic fields @xmath151 can be rather small and the effect of magnon decay can be clearly distinguished from the spinon physics , which is present for antiferromagnetic chains ."
