    "in this paper , the diagram monoids @xmath0 and one of its submonoids @xmath1 are first introduced in order to get an understanding of the diagram monoids @xmath2 and @xmath3,which are submonoids of @xmath1 .",
    "presentations of the latter two are provided in this paper , as well as references to papers in which presentations for the former two are provided .",
    "we then introduce the well known temperley - lieb algebra , @xmath4 . with these diagram monoids and the temperley - lieb algebra",
    ", we can give a presentation of the motzkin monoid , @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we show that any diagram in @xmath5 can be decomposed into a product of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",

    "this is particularly important because of the inductive nature of our proof .",
    "+ we start with a word in @xmath6 form , append a generator , @xmath10 , to the end of the word , and then try to get it back into @xmath6 form .",
    "we apply the relations of @xmath5 to first get @xmath11 into the form @xmath12 ( which we call @xmath13 form ) , where @xmath14 , and @xmath8 . from this @xmath13 form",
    ", we then get to minimal @xmath6 form , which is done by taking a diagram in @xmath13 form , and moving all the empty vertices to the right .",
    "this is done using five lemmas ( hop , burrow , slide , wallslide , and fuse wire ) , and also putting an order on @xmath1 . from here",
    ", we concern ourselves with the case that the edges in @xmath15 in minimal @xmath6 form have endpoints that are empty vertices of @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "we show that we can put words of this form into standard @xmath6 form ( where standard @xmath6 form is as defined in section 4.3.1 ) .",
    "+ the preceding inductive proof tells us that the number of distinct words is equal to the number of standard words , and thus equal to the number of diagrams in @xmath5 , giving us a presentation of @xmath5 .",
    "we define the _ rook monoid _ , denoted @xmath0 , as the set of one - to - one functions from a subset of @xmath18 to a subset of @xmath18 .",
    "these functions can be written as diagrams : a graph on two rows of @xmath19 vertices , each labeled from @xmath20 to @xmath19 from left to right . on the graph",
    "we connect vertices on the top line to vertices on the bottom line .",
    "take for example the following diagram in @xmath21 : +    @xmath22    the rook monoid is a _ monoid _ under the operation of function composition , where the functions go from the top row of vertices to the bottom . to perform function composition with two diagrams @xmath23 , @xmath24",
    ", we place @xmath23 above @xmath24 and identify the vertices in the bottom row of @xmath23 with the corresponding vertices in the top row of @xmath24 . in terms of functions , if we consider @xmath23 as the function @xmath25 , and @xmath24 as the function @xmath26 , then the product @xmath27  is thought of as the composition @xmath28 , where if @xmath29 is in the range of @xmath25 , and in the domain of @xmath26 , we get that the pre - image of @xmath29 , say @xmath30 , in @xmath25 is in the domain of @xmath28 , and the image of @xmath29 , say @xmath31 , in @xmath26 is in the range of @xmath28 . in particular , @xmath30 is in the domain of @xmath28 if and only if there exists @xmath29 in the domain of @xmath26 such that @xmath32 .",
    "this @xmath30 then corresponds to the value @xmath31 in the range of @xmath28 such that @xmath33 . note that in the diagram form we then draw an edge from @xmath30 on top to @xmath31 on bottom .",

    "+ if we desire a rook matrix of rank @xmath38 , we choose @xmath38 columns and @xmath38 rows in a total of @xmath39 ways .",
    "we then can choose to place the @xmath20s in the @xmath38 chosen rows / columns in a total of @xmath40 ways ( such that no row or column has two or more nonzero entries ) .",
    "summing over all the possible ranks up to and including @xmath19 gives rise to the order of @xmath0 : @xmath41    the relationship between diagrams and matrices is given in a very natural way .",
    "we connect the vertex in the @xmath42 position in the top row of a diagram to the @xmath43 position in the bottom row if and only if the corresponding matrix has a 1 in the ( @xmath44,@xmath45)-position .",
    "take for example the following matrix - diagram correspondence in @xmath21 : @xmath46    note that matrix multiplication is equivalent to diagram multiplication by stacking : @xmath47    is equivalent to    @xmath48    a presentation of the rook monoid is provided on page 339 in @xcite .",
    "the _ planar rook monoid _ ,",
    "@xmath1 , is the set of order - preserving one - to - one functions from a subset of @xmath49 to a subset of @xmath49 .",
    "these order - preserving functions correspond to those diagrams that can be drawn with edges that do not cross .",
    "for example , the set @xmath50 consists of the following diagrams :    @xmath50  =   @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56    for a diagram @xmath57 , we define @xmath58 and @xmath59 to be the sets containing the indices of the vertices of @xmath57 which are incident to an edge on top and on bottom respectively . for example ,    if @xmath57  =   @xmath60 , then @xmath61(@xmath57 ) = \\{1,2,3,5 } and @xmath62(@xmath57 ) = \\{@xmath63,@xmath64,@xmath65,@xmath66 } +    where we label the top vertices from 1 to @xmath19 and the bottom vertices from @xmath63 to @xmath67 . for a planar rook diagram @xmath57",

    "we define the _ right planar rook monoid _ to be the submonoid of the planar rook monoid which contains all the diagrams with the property that the top vertex of each edge is directly above or above and to the right of the bottom vertex .",
    "similarly , the _ left planar rook monoid _ is the submonoid where the top vertex of each edge is above or above and to the left of the bottom vertex .",
    "we denote these monoids @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "for example ,    @xmath89 and @xmath90    are in @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively . + we will now derive some facts about @xmath2 .      first , we prove a closed form for the size of @xmath2 . through numerical experimentation",
