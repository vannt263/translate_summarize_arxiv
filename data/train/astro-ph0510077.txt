    "groups of galaxies represent the most common galaxy environment at @xmath4 , containing as much as 60% of the galaxy population at the present day @xcite . due to their relatively low velocity dispersions ,",
    "groups of galaxies are ideal sites for galaxy - galaxy interactions which are likely to give rise to significant changes in the sfrs , total stellar masses , and morphological appearance of galaxies .",
    "recent studies in the local universe show that galaxy properties are indeed influenced by the group environment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , understanding the evolutionary processes in groups will probe not only the dependence of galaxy properties on environment , but also trace the importance of this common environment in driving global trends such as the strong decline in volume  averaged star formation since @xmath3 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "tracing galaxy evolution in groups requires the existence of higher redshift group catalogues .",
    "distant groups have always been difficult to recognize because of their sparse galaxy populations .",
    "the presence of high redshift groups has typically been inferred indirectly via the presence of a radio galaxy or x - ray emitting intragroup medium @xcite .",
    "however , these selection criteria detect only the richest , elliptical dominated groups .",
    "to reconcile this selection bias , large spectroscopic field surveys can be used to study galaxy groups selected purely on the basis of their three dimensional galaxy density .",
    "such catalogues of groups now exist .",
    "the second canadian network for observational cosmology redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) consists of @xmath6 photometry and spectroscopy , measuring @xmath7 10@xmath8 galaxy redshifts up to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this provided an powerful opportunity to generate a kinematically selected sample of intermediate redshift galaxy groups .",
    "a friends - of - friends percolation algorithm was used to detect groups of galaxies in redshift space @xcite .",
    "this sample can be used to study the influence of the typical group environment on galaxy properties at intermediate redshift . to this end , we have recently obtained deep _ hubble space telescope _ acs imaging of a sub - sample of 26 cnoc2 groups with redshifts @xmath10 , when the universe was @xmath11 its present age .",
    "the original spectroscopy has been supplemented with deeper spectroscopy using the _ ldss-2 _ spectrograph on the _",
    "magellan 6.5-m _ telescope @xcite and will be further supplemented by deep _",

    "combined with forthcoming / ongoing observations at uv ( _ galex _ ) , near infra - red ( _ sofi _ on the _ eso ntt _ ) and x - ray ( _ chandra _ ) wavelengths , we are building a unique catalogue of galaxy groups , combining significant look ",
    "back time with the depth required to probe the faint - end of the galaxy luminosity function , and coverage across the electomagnetic spectrum .",
    "magellan observations have extended the depth of our spectroscopic sample to r@xmath15 = 22.0 , down to which we have well  understood selection , and no bias towards emission ",

    ", our spectroscopic sample also contains 334 serendipitous field galaxies within this redshift range . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath16cdm cosmology of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the observed magnitudes of all galaxies in our sample are extinction corrected based upon the models of schlegel  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) @xcite .",

    "frame  luminosity ( ) is computed from the best - fit sed .",
    "this band is chosen because it closely matches the cnoc2 spectroscopic selection band ( @xmath20 ) in the observed  frame , and it facilitates comparisons with the 2pigg local group catalogue .",
    "to study the relative levels of star formation in statistical galaxy samples , we use the [ oii]@xmath22 emission line which lies centrally in the visible window at @xmath23 and at wavelengths of low sky emission .",
    "we note that due to uncertainties in the calibration of star formation rates , we deliberately limit our study to direct comparisons between measurements of the equivalent width ( ew ) of [ oii ] .",
    "normalisation by the continuum also reduces uncertainties related to absorption by dust and aperture bias .",
    "we are motivated by the clear bimodal distribution in colour and ew [ ] ( e.g. @xcite ) which show that the fraction of red , passive galaxies is strongly dependent upon local galaxy density . to examine how the fraction of passive galaxies depends upon environment in our sample",
    ", we impose an arbitrary division at ew[oii]=5 .",
    "we expect the population with ew[oii]@xmath25  to be dominated by passive galaxies and the population with ew[oii]@xmath245  to be dominated by star - forming galaxies .",
    "this division is sufficient to reveal trends in statistical samples ( e.g. @xcite ) . to assess the relative size of each population ,",
    "we define * @xmath25 * to equal the weighted fraction of galaxies with ew[oii]@xmath25  ( i.e. an estimator of the fraction of _ passive _ galaxies ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fplum]*(a ) * shows how @xmath25 , depends upon galaxy -band luminosity in the group and field samples .",
    "the group galaxy sample is limited to those within @xmath26mpc of the luminosity - weighted group centroid .",
    "there is a clear enhancement of @xmath25 in the group galaxies with respect to the field , especially in the luminosity range @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "combining all galaxies within the luminosity range @xmath29@xmath30 , the enhancement in groups of @xmath25 is better than @xmath31 significance , and this trend is still evident if the most massive two groups ( velocity dispersion @xmath32  km  s@xmath33 ) are excluded from the sample .",
    "we interpret the enhancement of @xmath25 in groups as direct evidence that galaxies in intermediate redshift groups are significantly less likely to have ongoing star formation than field galaxies .",
    "this could be a related to either a different formation history in the group environment , intragroup environmental processes accelerating galaxy evolution to the passive state , or a combination of these two effects .",
    "we also note that their is a strong luminosity dependence on @xmath25 in both group and field samples , such that a higher fraction of brighter galaxies are passive by z@xmath00.4 .",
    "this is consistent with the overall picture that more massive galaxies have formed all their stars at earlier epochs .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fplum]*(b ) * we examine evolution in the cluster , group and field environments . for our low redshift sample ,",

    "( 2001 ) @xcite .",

    "( 2005 ) @xcite sample we apply a luminosity limit of @xmath35 to all data .",
    "this figure neatly illustrates the strength of evolution observed for @xmath25 in groups and the field whilst galaxies in dense cluster cores were already largely passive by @xmath36 .      with deep hst acs ( hubble space telescope - advanced camera for surveys ) f775w filter observations of our cnoc2 groups we have the resolving power to classify galaxy morphologies to well below the magnitude limit of our spectroscopy .",
    "in this way we can isolate the morphological transformations which may be driving galaxy evolution in groups at intermediate redshift .    to date",
    ", a sub - sample of galaxies from the first 16 acs fields have been morphologically classified visually by augustus oemler jnr . ( ao ) .",
    "galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the @xmath10 redshift range were visually classified according to the morphs classification scheme @xcite .",
    "the current sample of morphologically classified cnoc2 galaxies includes 158 group and 124 field galaxies .    to assess the statistical significance of differences between the morphological composition of group and field samples ,",
    "we bin the galaxies into four broad morphological classes . these are elliptical , s0 , spiral and other ( mostly irregular and merger types ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ftypelum ] we show the fraction of galaxies of each morphological type , @xmath37 in 3 bins of luminosity ( @xmath38 , @xmath39@xmath40 , @xmath41@xmath30 ) . in our cosmology . ]",
    "the solid line with the filled circles represents the group galaxy population and the dashed line with the open circles represents the field population .",
    "it shows that whilst spiral galaxies dominate the field galaxy population , there is a significant deficit of spirals in galaxy groups ( @xmath31 computed for all galaxies @xmath30 ) . in the place of these spirals , there is an excess of early - type galaxies in groups .",
    "there is a @xmath42 excess of ellipticals and a @xmath43 excess of s0 type galaxies in total .",
    "figure  [ fig : ftypelum ] indicates that the elliptical excess is most significant at faint luminosities , where the field elliptical population is less important .",
    "however at brighter luminosities , the s0 population seems to become very important in groups .",
    "in fact , brighter than @xmath44 there are 16 group and no field s0 type galaxies .",
    "we compute the fraction of s0 galaxies in this luminosity range to be @xmath45 in the groups . a bootstrap - resampling technique",
    "is then used to estimate the significance of this excess with respect to @xmath46 in the field .",
    "we find that there is a @xmath47 excess of bright s0s in groups .",
    "finally , we also note that bright s0s appear to be particularly predominant in groups with velocity dispersions of @xmath48  km  s@xmath33 .",
    "indeed , six of these galaxies are located in just two groups ( 3 in group 37 , @xmath49  km  s@xmath33 and 3 in group 39 , @xmath50  km  s@xmath33 ) , suggesting that the formation of bright s0 galaxies appears to be biased towards a certain type of group environment , as represented by these groups .    a comparison with the @xmath51 morphs cluster sample of dressler et .",
    "1997 ) @xcite indicates that our groups match the morphological composition of the irregular morphs clusters ( @xmath52 spirals , @xmath52 ellipticals and @xmath53 s0s ) .",
    "this suggests that the morphological mix of unvirialised clusters is likely to be already in place during the infalling group stage .",
    "another interesting class of galaxy is the passive spiral .",
    "these galaxies are still morphologically spiral - type , but with no sign of ongoing star formation ( in our case , ew[oii]@xmath25 ) .",
    "passive spirals have typically aroused interest in cluster studies , where they have often been interpreted to be infalling spiral galaxies in which star formation has been somehow truncated without any morphological transformation , up to the point of observation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fplumsps]*(a ) * shows @xmath25 as a function of luminosity , only for galaxies which are morphologically classified spirals ( 67 in groups , 68 in the field ) . at brighter luminosities ( @xmath54 ) , the population of spiral galaxies is clearly more passive in groups ( solid line , filled circles ) than the field ( dashed line , open circles ) .",
    "this excess is assessed at @xmath55 signficance using a resampling method .",
    "interestingly , the lack of any passive spiral excess in fainter galaxies suggests that interactions with the igm are unlikely to be responsible , since less massive galaxies have smaller gravitational potential wells , and thus should lose their gas more easily . in the right - hand panels of figure  [ fig : fplumsps ] , we examine whether @xmath25 in bright ( @xmath54 ) spiral galaxies has any dependence upon its group - centric radius , dr * ( b ) * and group - centric radius , normalised by the rms(dr ) for the parent group * ( c)*. it is clear that a larger fraction of spiral galaxies are passive towards the group centre , and that this relation holds when the radial distance is normalised by the typical group - centric radius of each group .",
    "this indicates that processes leading to the ceasation of star formation in bright spiral galaxies are tightly related to the group environment .",
    "however , we note that we find no passive spiral in the two most massive groups ( @xmath56600  km  s@xmath33 ) .",
    "since passive galaxies in local clusters seem to be found predominantly in the cluster outskirts @xcite , we believe passive spirals are therefore most likely to be found in environments typical of smaller groups and the outskirts of clusters .",
    "we have presented an analysis of galaxy properties in the group and field environments at intermediate redshift ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is part of an ongoing study of how the group environment influences galaxy evolution .",
    "our main conclusions to date can be summarized as follows :    * whist ( massive ) galaxies were largely passive in cluster cores by @xmath3 , there has been strong evolution in the fraction of passive galaxies ( @xmath25 ) in groups and the field since @xmath57 .",
    "this must be important when considering the global budget of star formation .",
    "* galaxies in cnoc2 groups are more likely to be passive or bulge - dominated than in the cnoc2 field .",
    "* however , the morphological composition of the z@xmath58 group population matches that of the irregular morphs clusters at similar redshift .",
    "* excesses of bright s0s and passive spirals in cnoc2 groups relates the 2 galaxy types and suggests that the s0 formation process may favour groups .",
