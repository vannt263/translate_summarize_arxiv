    "the hybridizable discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) framework , proposed in @xcite ( 2009 ) for second order elliptic problems , provides a unifying strategy for hybridization of finite element methods .",
    "the unifying framework includes as particular cases hybridized versions of mixed methods @xcite , the continuous galerkin ( cg ) method @xcite , and a wide class of hybridizable discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) methods . here",
    "hybridization denotes the process to rewrite a finite element method as a hybrid version .",
    "it should be pointed that the raviart - thomas ( rt ) @xcite and brezzi - douglas - marini ( bdm ) mixed methods were first shown in @xcite to have equivalent hybridized versions , and an overview of some hybridization techniques was presented in @xcite . in the so - called hdg methods following the hdg framework , the constraint of function continuity on the inter - element boundaries is relaxed by introducing lagrange multipliers defined on the the inter - element boundaries , thus allowing for piecewise - independent approximation to the potential or flux solution . by local elimination of the unknowns defined in the interior of elements ,",
    "the hdg methods finally lead to symmetric and positive definite ( spd ) systems where the unknowns are only the globally coupled degrees of freedom describing the lagrange multipliers .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the convergence analysis of several hdg methods for the second order elliptic problems .",
    "closely related to the hdg framework is the weak galerkin ( wg ) finite element method @xcite pioneered by wang and ye @xcite .",
    "the wg method is designed by using a weakly defined gradient operator over functions with discontinuity , and then allows the use of totally discontinuous piecewise polynomials in the finite element procedure . by introducing the discrete weak gradient as an independent variable , as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the wg method can be rewritten as some hdg version when the diffusion - dispersion tensor in the corresponding second order elliptic equation is a piecewise - constant matrix .",
    "it is well - known that the design of fast solvers is a key component to numerically solving partial differential equations . for the hdg methods as well as the wg methods ,",
    "so far there are only limited literature concerning this issue . in @xcite ( 2009 )",

    "based on the convergence results of the two - level algorithm , * algorithm [ algo : two - level ] * , ( cf .",
    "theorems [ thm : convergence]-[thm : convergence2 ] ) , it is easy to show that the multigrid methods which fall into the proposed two - level algorithm framework for the hdg methods all converge .",
    "we note that the analyses in @xcite and @xcite require full regularity ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 $ ] , respectively .",
    "* we only assume the grids to be conforming and shape regular .",
    "thus , the quasi - uniform condition , which is assumed in @xcite , is not required in our analysis .",
    "therefore , based on fast solvers for the auxiliary space , our analysis can be used to design fast solvers on adaptively refined grids and completely unstructured grids .",

    "similar to the hdg methods , one can easily show that the symmetric gauss - seidel iteration always satisfies * assumption [ assum : r_h 1]*.    when @xmath10 is a piecewise constant matrix , from the hdg - like formulation we can see that the wg framework is essentially equivalent to the corresponding hdg framework . as a result ,",
