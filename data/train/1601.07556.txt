    "the twin higgs ( th ) mechanism provides a natural means to stabilize the electroweak scale up to @xmath0 with uncolored top partners , that belong to a twin dark copy of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "this framework thus can relax the evolving tension between naturalness expectations and the current limits on traditional top partners , and is therefore an attractive solution to the little hierarchy problem .    the central idea behind",
    "the th mechanism is that the higgs is realized as a pseudo - goldstone boson of an accidental global symmetry , which suffices to protect its mass from one loop quadratic corrections . in the simplest case ,",
    "this structure is the result of an ( approximate ) @xmath1 exchange symmetry between the sm and twin sectors .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a systematic discussion of more exotic options . ) in order for the @xmath1 exchange symmetry to provide sufficient protection @xcite , the matter content of the twin sector must at the very least contain a twin third generation of quarks  a twin top and twin bottom ",
    "charged under twin color @xmath2 and twin electroweak @xmath3 gauge groups , such that the twin top yukawa and twin @xmath3 coupling are close to the corresponding sm values .",
    "naturalness does not significantly constrain the remaining features of the twin sector , but all th models contain a lightest twin particle ( ltp ) and a lightest twin hadron ( lth ) .",
    "the latter is either a bound state of twin quarks or a twin glueball .",
    "th models moreover contain all the structure required to incorporate dark matter ( dm ) candidates , in the form of either a twin weakly charged wimp @xcite  hereafter , a ` t - wimp '  or twin baryonic asymmetric dark matter @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on th models featuring t - wimp candidates .",
    "although they require no additional light states with sm charges , twin higgs models may nevertheless produce striking signatures in a variety of direct and indirect searches .",
    "the effectiveness of the various probes is mostly determined by the lifetime , decay modes and masses of the lth and ltp , and as such it is useful to sketch out the space of signatures in terms of the properties of these two particles . in detail : ( i ) relativistic ltps at either the bbn or cmb epochs lead to strong tensions with current bounds on the effective sm neutrino degrees of freedom @xmath4 ; ( ii ) twin states may be produced at the lhc through an exotic decay of the sm - like higgs or its heavier partner , or through the decay of some of the tev - scale , colored states that could be accessible in certain uv completions . in some th models ,",
    "this can lead to interesting lhc signatures from the decay of the lth @xcite ; ( iii ) a lth that is metastable on bbn timescales may lead to either overclosure , arising from other ( meta)stable hadrons with masses nearby to the lth , or post - bbn matter - dominated eras that disrupt the standard bbn paradigm ; ( iv ) annihilation of t - wimp candidates into hard @xmath5 quarks , charm quarks or @xmath6 s may create tensions with evolving astrophysical bounds on antiproton or positron production in the galactic central stellar cluster ( see e.g. @xcite ) . finally , apart from these lth and ltp signatures , one may also search for deviations of higgs couplings .",
    "these are in principle the most robust probes of twin higgs models , but their reach at the lhc is rather limited @xcite .",
    "several th models have been previously proposed , that may be broadly characterized by these signatures .",
    "the first instance is the ` mirror twin higgs ' @xcite , which includes a full copy of the sm in the twin sector .",
    "the ltps are therefore twin neutrinos and twin photons , while the lth is a twin pion that rapidly decays to twin leptons and twin photons well before bbn .",
    "this model is susceptible to strong bbn and cmb bounds on @xmath4 . to evade these , one either requires an asymmetric reheating between both sectors @xcite or require large entropy production during the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "two other recent th proposals include the ` fraternal twin higgs ' @xcite and the ` vector - like twin higgs ' @xcite . in these constructions , the low energy spectrum of the twin hadronic sector",
    "is given by a zero or one light flavor twin qcd theory .",
    "the lth is then either a glueball or an onium state whose mass is determined by the twin confinement scale , @xmath7 , that is itself constrained to be nearby the sm confinement scale , @xmath8 . in the vector - like twin higgs model , the lth and the ltp are the same particle , but in the fraternal twin higgs model the ltp can be either a twin neutrino or the lth itself .",
    "the decays of the lth may generate ( possibly displaced ) collider signatures , while a twin neutrino ltp contributes @xmath9 @xcite , that is potentially detectable in the future .",
    "these models can further admit a twin tau t - wimp that annihilates into twin hadrons , some of which in turn decay to @xmath10 or @xmath11 pairs ( see e.g. @xcite ) , potentially detectable in ( future ) astrophysical data .",

    "laid out in this fashion , it becomes clear that there is a fourth category of th models , which is so far largely unexplored in the literature .",
    "namely , the case where the ltp is heavy enough to trivially avoid @xmath4 constraints , while the lth is at the same time always light enough , and therefore metastable enough , to be invisible at the lhc .",
    "while certain parts of the parameter space of the fraternal and vector - like twins realize this scenario , we consider here models in which these features are robust predictions everywhere in parameter space .",
    "a well - motivated and representative example is a twin sector that contains a mirror copy of the sm hadrons ",
    "i.e. all three twin quark generations with three light quark flavors  but no dark radiation ",
    "i.e. no light leptons or photons .",
    "a t - wimp may be incorporated as an additional dirac or majorana state .",
    "we call this scenario the _ `",
    "hadrosymmetric twin higgs'_.    in this scenario , the existence of multiple light twin quark flavors produces a twin pion lth , a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) . unlike in zero and one light flavor twin sectors",
    ", here the pion mass may be much lighter than the twin confinement scale .",
    "the absence of dark radiation ensures the twin pion is also the ltp and avoids , in the most straightforward manner , tension with @xmath4 bounds , provided the twin pion is heavier than @xmath22 mev . without dark radiation decay modes ,",
    "the twin pion must promptly decay by bbn to sm degrees of freedom to avoid overclosure or a matter - dominated era thereafter by twin pngbs . on collider timescales",
    "the twin pion is then stable ( cf .",
    "e.g. refs @xcite ) and appears as missing energy produced with only a small cross - section : from the viewpoint of collider and @xmath4 searches , the hadrosymmetric scenario then represents a ` least detectable ' scenario compared to the other models in table i.    we show in this work , however , that these generic features have several implications , that , along with the bbn lifetime bound , provide other means to effectively probe the hadrosymmetric scenario .",
    "first , since the ltp is a pngb and therefore a pseudoscalar , it can not decay efficiently to sm states through the higgs portal .",
    "a sufficiently prompt twin pion decay by bbn therefore requires the existence of an additional twin - sm mediation scale .",
    "( this situation is similar to the case with one light flavor , where the lth is @xmath23 meson @xcite . )",
    "there are a limited number of choices for such a portal , especially if one wants to retain a minimal twin - higgs sector and not introduce additional sm - charged particles .",
    "there are two phenomenologically different regimes for this portal , corresponding to whether the twin pion mass is above or below three times the sm pion mass , @xmath24 : since the twin pngbs can be much lighter than the twin confinement scale , the twin pion mass is a free parameter of the theory . in the case",
    "that the twin pion mass is above @xmath24 , we find the portal does not require a uv completion below the twin higgs cutoff scale .",
    "however , if the twin pion mass is below @xmath24 , we show , for a representative mediation model , that in most of the viable parameter space the bbn lifetime bound implies that the mediator itself should be accessible either at the lhc or at the intensity frontier .",
    "second , the strongly - coupled twin sector generically acts like a neutral natural hidden valley @xcite , and in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , dm annihilations into twin quarks can therefore produce ` dark showers ' of twin hadrons , that then subsequently decay to the sm sector . in the case that the twin pions are lighter than @xmath24 , a leptophobic mediator ensures that twin pion decays are predominantly to diphotons .",
    "if instead they are heavier than @xmath24 , the twin pions decay mainly to three sm pions and hence to a higher multiplicity of softer photons or leptons .",
    "the indirect detection signatures for dark showers are then mainly encoded into photons , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , evading present or future astrophysical cosmic - ray bounds on the associated emission of antiprotons and positrons .",
    "this dark showering to photons may produce a visible astrophysical signal .",
    "we present detailed numerical simulations of the photon spectra produced by dirac and majorana t - wimp annihilation in the galactic center , compared against @xmath25-ray data from _ fermi_-lat .",
    "we find that for a dirac t - wimp , there is a viable region of parameter space in which these dark showers may reproduce the putative galactic center @xmath25-ray excess ( gce ) , claimed to be seen in _ fermi_-lat data from the central regions of the milky way galaxy  @xcite and dwarf spheroidal galaxies  @xcite , as well as simultaneously generate an appropriate amount of dm and exhibit minimal fine - tuning .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite which discuss alternative astrophysical explanations for the gce , or dispute observations of an excess in dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite . ) alternatively , treating observed photon fluxes as a conservative upper bound , there are large regions of parameter space are not excluded by current galactic center @xmath25-ray data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ sec : twin ] we present the hadrosymmetric twin higgs model and benchmark dark matter models , followed by an examination of all applicable astrophysical , cosmological and collider bounds in sec .  [",
    "sec : bounds ] . in sec .",

    "sec : indirect ] , along with both fits to gce spectra and constraints from @xmath25-ray fluxes .",
    "in the twin higgs framework the sm higgs is realized as the pngb of a spontaneously broken global symmetry .",
    "the key difference with traditional pngb higgs frameworks is that the symmetry in question is _ accidental _ rather than exact .",
    "this has the advantage that the top partner may be fully neutral under the sm gauge groups , which removes conventional collider constraints on the top partner . on the other hand",
    ", this also implies that the accidental symmetry is generally not radiatively stable beyond 5 to 10 tev , at which scale a uv completion is then required .",
    "the known options for uv completions are supersymmetry @xcite , compositeness @xcite , orbifolds @xcite and holographic setups @xcite .",
    "the original version of the th model @xcite consists of a complete dark copy of the sm gauge and matter content , which are mapped into each other by @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the higgs potential is further assumed to have an approximate @xmath26 symmetry , of which the sm higgs , @xmath27 , and twin higgs , @xmath28 , furnish a @xmath26 fundamental @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite or @xmath30 group @xcite is needed to ensure that custodial symmetry is preserved . in this paper",
    "we are agnostic about the specific uv completion and we therefore do not make this distinction here . ] ( hereafter , we denote all twin sector objects by a prime . ) in the broken phase of both the sm and twin @xmath3 , the remaining physical degrees of freedom in the higgs sector are a pngb , @xmath31 , and a heavy radial mode .",
    "the pngb @xmath31 is then naturally light , and is identified with the scalar particle observed at the lhc .",
    "even if the accidental @xmath26 symmetry holds at tree - level , it is broken at one loop by the presence of yukawa and gauge couplings .",
    "as such , @xmath31 will then receive important radiative corrections .",
    "the key feature of the th framework is , however , that the most dangerous correction  the one - loop quadratic divergence  is cancelled by the presence of the @xmath1 exchange symmetry between the sm and twin sectors .    in many models ,",
    "the @xmath1 is itself only an approximate symmetry , mainly to avoid introducing too many extra light degrees of freedom in tension with @xmath13 bounds . the quality of the @xmath1 that is needed to adequately cancel the quadratic divergence depends on the cut - off , @xmath32 , of the twin higgs setup . for @xmath33 tev ,",
    "one requires @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the top ( twin top ) yukawa , and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the ( twin ) color gauge coupling .",
    "there are no restrictions on the twin hypercharge coupling , @xmath39 , nor on the remaining twin yukawa couplings , other than that they can not be @xmath40 .",
    "the complete absence of the first two generations , or a gauged twin hypercharge , do not reintroduce an appreciable amount of fine - tuning .",
    "in this paper we consider the ` hadrosymmetric ' twin higgs scenario , for which the twin sector contains twin copies for all three generations of quarks , but the twin lepton sector is absent .",
    "we also assume that twin hypercharge , if present , is at most only a global symmetry , but is not gauged .",
    "as in traditional pngb higgs models , the twin higgs setup generically predicts mixing between the sm and twin higgs , that results in @xmath40 higgs coupling deviations . to reduce this mixing to acceptable levels , the sm sector vacuum expectation value @xmath41 must be tuned down with respect to the vacuum expectation in the twin sector @xmath42 . to be consistent with the current status of the higgs branching ratio fits",
    ", one requires @xmath43 ( see ref .  @xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec : hiw ] below ) , which corresponds to @xmath44 fine - tuning .",
    "( see , however , @xcite for a recent example with a smaller fine - tuning . ) in principle , there may be several ways for the sm to communicate with the twin sector , but the twin - higgs mixing with the sm higgs is the only portal common to all models .    in the absence of gauged twin hypercharge ,",
    "the heavy @xmath45 gauge bosons are degenerate , @xmath46 , so that their masses scale with a factor of @xmath47 with respect to their sm counterparts .",
    "navely , all twin quarks are similarly typically @xmath47 times heavier than their sm counterparts .",
    "however since all twin yukawas except @xmath36 are almost unconstrained , this assumption may be relaxed for all quarks except for the twin top . for most of the discussion in this paper ,",
    "we nevertheless assume the twin yukawas are set by the sm - twin @xmath1 such that @xmath48 , and the twin quark masses are then @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .      for the @xmath51 deviation of twin qcd coupling , @xmath38 , permitted in eq .",
    ", computing the two - loop renormalization group evolution from the uv cutoff down , one finds a corresponding @xmath40 deviation in the twin confinement scale compared to the sm , viz . @xmath52 with two or three light flavors ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath53 on the mass spectrum of the twin fermions is rather mild .",
    "we shall therefore treat the confinement scale ratio @xmath53 as a free parameter of the twin theory , within the range indicated by eq .  .",
    "we characterize twin quarks as light or heavy depending on whether their mass is small or large compared to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking or to the confinement scale , as appropriate .",
    "hadronic matrix elements of nave mass dimension @xmath54 typically scale as @xmath55 . as an immediate example",
    ", the masses of non - pngb light quark hadrons typically scale as @xmath56 and the twin pion decay constant @xmath57 .",
    "( we adopt the convention under which @xmath58  mev . ) the masses of heavy quark mesons , in contrast , scale linearly with the heavy quark mass .",
    "we consider twin sectors with at least two light twin quark flavors , so that the hadronic spectrum contains pngbs .",
    "we focus mainly on the case that the twin sector has exactly three light twin quarks , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , just as on the sm side . to be certain that the strange is light",

    "the twin pions embed into a twin isospin triplet ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "unlike in the sm sector , in the absence of a gauged twin hypercharge , twin isospin breaking arises only from the splitting of the yukawas .",
    "in particular , twin pion mass splitting effects arise only at second order in isospin breaking , such that @xmath72 in which @xmath73 is the isospin breaking in the sm sector induced by splitting of the up - down yukawas . in most of the parameter space ,",
    "we therefore expect the mass splitting of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 to be much smaller than for the sm pions , but with the same sign .    in the class of twin sector scenarios we consider in this paper , the twin pions @xmath76 are charged under a ( residual ) global @xmath77 and therefore stable . in the absence of a light twin photon or other twin - sm mediator , the @xmath74 can only decay via the higgs portal to sm final states .",
    "this decay requires both parity and twin isospin violation and is therefore heavily suppressed .",
    "we discuss this and twin - sm mediator models for decay of the twin pion in further detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : tpdm ] .",
    "apart from pions , the remainder of the twin light hadron spectrum comprises : higher spin states , such as the @xmath78 or @xmath79 ; a twin @xmath80 ; glueballs such as the @xmath81 ; and baryons , such as the twin proton @xmath82 and neutron @xmath83 .",
    "similar expectations apply to the expected twin proton - neutron mass splitting , as for the pion mass splitting .",
    "the twin proton is stabilized by baryon number , while the heavier twin neutron is stable as well due to the absence of light twin leptons .",
    "we assume all heavier hadrons strongly or weakly decay to pions , @xmath83 and @xmath82 , as in the sm sector , and that there is no twin baryon asymmetry .",
    "we consider two different twin sector benchmark scenarios that produce respectively majorana or dirac dm , coupled to the twin sector by twin electroweak interactions . along with three generations of twin quarks ",

    "this single electroweak doublet is the minimal content required to cancel the @xmath45 witten anomaly .",

    "we have studied a twin wimp ( t - wimp ) scenario whose twin sector contains a mirror copy of the sm hadrons  i.e. all three twin quark generations with three light quark flavors  but no dark radiation ",
    "i.e. no light twin leptons or photons . by comparison with existing twin higgs frameworks ,",
    "this scenario represents a relatively unexplored region of the twin higgs theory space .    unlike various other twin higgs frameworks , here the lightest twin degrees of freedom of this _ hadrosymmetric _ twin higgs model are twin pions  pseudoscalars  whose coupling to the sm sector via the higgs portal is heavily suppressed . while the twin hadron sector can nevertheless be accessed at the lhc through the higgs portal , any energy injected into the twin sector will just produce a shower of detector - stable , invisible particles .",
    "the only robust handles at the lhc , then , are evolving constraints on the invisible width of the higgs .    from a cosmological and astrophysical point of view , however , the presence of light twin pions results in a much richer set of constraints and detection modes . to avoid a matter - dominated or overclosed universe post - bbn arising from metastable twin pions , the decay of the lightest hadron  the @xmath391  must be completed by the bbn epoch . for @xmath392 , this implies the presence of a new sm - twin mediation portal with a mass scale around a tev or below .",
    "this new mediator can be probed at the intensity frontier or at the lhc in almost all of its viable parameter space . despite the absence of dark radiation and lhc - accessible twin",
    "hadron decays , we nevertheless find a remarkable experimental complementarity between the cosmological bounds , the lhc and the intensity frontier .    in the dirac and majorana dm scenarios we consider ,",
    "the dark matter freezes out through twin - electroweak mediated annihilation into twin quarks .",
    "annihilations of t - wimps then produce dark showers of twin hadrons which are either stable  such as the @xmath75 and twin proton  or decay to sm photons  the @xmath74 . apart from higgs",
    "invisible width bounds , these dm annihilations at the decoupling epoch are competitively constrained by cmb reionization bounds .",
    "such dm annihilations in the galactic center , however , naturally evade all astrophysical cosmic - ray constraints on antiproton or position production and proceed at a rate commensurate with a thermal relic cross - section , that in turn corresponds to a photon flux near the current sensitivities of _ fermi_-lat .",
    "simulations of this dark showering process reveal that for the dirac dm scenario , regions of parameter space that produce the observed dm abundances , as determined within the twin higgs framework , and as preferred by naturalness and higgs coupling constraints , are precisely those regions that successfully reproduce the claimed galactic center @xmath25-ray excess in the _ fermi_-lat data .",
    "conversely , current galactic center data , when applied as an upper bound on the total @xmath25-ray flux from the galactic center , only partially constrains the available parameter space .    in this work",
    "we have mostly considered scenarios that do not admit a significant leptonic decay mode , @xmath393 .",
    "should this decay channel be available , the required sm - twin portal can easily be out of reach of any near future experiment .",
    "however , the astrophysical bounds or reach for dm annihilations in the galactic center into high multiplicity soft leptonic final states are currently unknown .",
    "this may be explored in the future by conducting dedicated dark showering and galactic propagation simulations for this soft leptonic scenario .",
