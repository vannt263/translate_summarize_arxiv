    "the majority of these proposals deals with the situation where the entangled particles are emitted in a random and uncontrolled fashion , while entanglement on demand is implicit in the scheme proposed in ref ..    current interest concentrates on setups which are capable to produce pairs of entangled electrons ` on demand ' .",

    "another remark concerns the case of an alternating voltage signal with no net charge transport and hence zero accumulated particle numbers @xmath234 .",
    "equation ( [ naven ] ) then tells us that @xmath235 and the bell inequality ( [ bi_n ] ) is formally violated . however , we argue that this violation is again unphysical and due to the same improper normalization of the basic quantities @xmath186 , etc .",
    "as encountered previously for the case of small faraday flux @xmath162 : concentrating on the expression @xmath236 , we note that two pulses with opposite signs allow for processes where the charge driven through the two spin detectors satisfies @xmath237 and hence @xmath238 , in contradiction with the requirements of the lemma .",
    "note that the manner of violating the bell inequality is quite different for the physical cases involving pulses with a single particle ( see the discussion of single integer - flux pulses in sec .",
    "[ sec : if ] with @xmath148 , or the discussion of many integer - flux pulses in sec.[sec : mifp ] with @xmath239 and @xmath240 ) and for the unphysical situation of an alternating signal with @xmath235 discussed above : in the first case the small denominator results from a cancellation between the product term @xmath241 and the negative number correlator @xmath242 , hence @xmath243 , while in the second case , the product term vanishes and there is no compensation , although the final result is the same , @xmath244 .",
    "the same apparent violation appears at large non - integer values of @xmath149 and long measuring times , where the term @xmath245 becomes dominant , cf .",
    "( [ bi4 ] ) .",
    "the application of voltage pulses to a mesoscopic fork allows to generate spin - entangled pairs of electrons through post - selection ; the presence of these entangled pairs can be observed in a bell inequality measurement based on particle - number cross - correlators .",
    "a number of items have to be observed in producing these entangled objects : _",
    "i ) _ equilibrium fluctuations competing with the pulse signal have to be eliminated .",
    "this can be achieved with the help of a four - channel beam splitter as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fork](b ) where the channel mixing is tuned such that the transmission @xmath6 between the upper and lower channel is blocked .",
    "_ ii ) _ pulses @xmath68 with integer faraday flux @xmath246 injecting an integer number of particles shall be used .",
    "otherwise , the ` fractional injection ' of a particle induces a long - time perturbation in the system producing a logarithmically divergent contribution to the excess number correlator .",
    "the flux @xmath247 , @xmath248 an integer , associated with the voltage pulse has to be precise within the limit @xmath249 , with @xmath160 the measurement time of the pulse and @xmath109 the pulse width . _",
    "iii ) _ the bell inequality is violated for pulses injecting a single pair of electrons with opposite spin , i.e. , pulses with one faraday flux and hence @xmath148 . the maximal violation of the inequality points to the full entanglement of the pair  the question what type of pulses produce only partially entangled states ( as quantified in terms of concurrence or negativity of the partially transposed density matrix @xcite ) has not been addressed here . _",
    "iv ) _ although weak pumping with pulses carrying less than one faraday flux , i.e. , @xmath164 , formally violate the bell inequality ( note the proviso _",
    "ii ) _ , however ) , we associate this spurious violation with an improper normalization of the particle - number ratios @xmath250 entering the bell inequality . _",
    "v ) _ the same argument also applies to the case of pumping with an alternating signal  we find the bell inequality always violated when the average injected current vanishes ( i.e. , when the number of carriers transmitted in the forward and backward directions are equal ) .",
    "again , the origin of this spurious violation is located in the improper normalization of the particle - number ratios @xmath251 for this situation .",
    "the above points suggest the following physical interpretation : an integer - flux pulse with faraday flux @xmath252 extracts exactly @xmath143 electron pairs from the reservoir which then are tested in the bell measurement setup . for @xmath148",
    "we find the bell inequality maximally violated , implying that the electrons within the pair are maximally entangled and not entangled with the remaining electrons in the fermi sea . on the other hand , the application of a fractional - flux pulse with non - integer @xmath143 produces a superposition of states with different number of excess electron pairs in the fork .",
    "the electrons injected into the fork then remain entangled with those in the fermi sea and their analysis in the bell measurement setup makes no sense .    in our analysis of the spurious violations of bell inequalities for weak",
    "pumping and for alternating drives we have identified the presence of reverse particle flow as the problematic element . in the weak pumping limit",
    "this conclusion has been conjectured from the appearance of negative values in the current cross - correlator , implying negative values of the particle - number correlator for @xmath253 .",
    "although we believe that these are strong arguments supporting our interpretation , we are not aware of a formal analysis of the backflow appearing in this type of systems .",
    "the question to be addressed then is : given a bias signal driving particles through the device in the forward direction , what are the circumstances and what is the probability to find particles moving in the opposite direction ( backflow ) ?",
    "a related problem has been addressed by levitov @xcite ( see also ref .  ) who has derived the full counting statistics for the charge transport across a quantum point contact in the weak @xmath84 pumping regime and has identified parameters producing a strictly unidirectional flow .",
    "the corresponding analysis for our system remains to be done .",
    "a similar scheme for producing spin - entangled pairs of electrons has been discussed in ref .  , where a constant voltage @xmath254 has been applied to the source lead ` s ' . in this case",
    ", the source reservoir injects a regular sequence of spin - singlet pairs of electrons separated by the voltage time @xmath255 ; the bell inequality then is violated at short times only .",
    "the main novelty of the present proposal is the generation of well separated spin - entangled electron pairs in response to distinguished voltage pulses , thus avoiding the short time correlation measurement at time scales of order @xmath256 .",
    "our mesoscopic fork device produces entangled pairs of electrons with a probability of 50 % , i.e. , half of the single - flux pulses will produce a useful pair with one spin propagating in the upper and the other in the lower channel .",
    "the competing events with both particles moving in one channel produce no useful outcome .",
    "this is similar to the finding of beenakker _",
    "@xcite who derive a concurrence corresponding to the production of one entangled pair per two pumping cycles . in",
    "how far this represents an upper limit in the performance of this type of devices or what type of entanglement generators are able to reach ( at least ideally ) 100 % efficiency is an interesting problem .",
