    "the top quark , with its large mass , represents a perfect laboratory to probe electroweak symmetry breaking and its associated new physics .",
    "the tevatron program has produced thousands of top quarks and overall observes good agreement between measured top properties and the expectations of the standard model ( sm ) . as the lhc accumulates luminosity , there is potential to study the top in a whole new energy regime , perhaps revealing secrets that are too subtle to discern at lower energies .",
    "one particular measurement at the tevatron already shows an intriguing deviation from the sm expectation , the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry @xmath6 .",
    "this observable measures the tendency of the top quark in a @xmath0 pair to move forward along the same direction as the incoming quark as opposed to backward in the direction of the incoming anti - quark . in the standard model ,",
    "this quantity deviates from zero at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd , and thus can be a sensitive probe of new physics which contributes in principle at tree level .",
    "previous measurements by both cdf and d0 showed a tantalizing ( but not very significant ) discrepancy with the sm expectation @xcite .",
    "the situation has become even more fascinating with the recent cdf study based on larger statistics and examining separately the high and low @xmath0 invariant mass ( @xmath7 ) regions @xcite . at low invariant masses ,",
    "the asymmetry is roughly consistent with the standard model expectations . at high invariant masses @xmath8 , where one might naturally expect the effects of heavy new physics to manifest ,",
    "the asymmetry is observed to be nearly @xmath9 , exceeding the sm prediction by @xmath10 .",
    "this result is striking , and emphasizes the need to better understand the top forward - backward asymmetry within the sm , to explore models of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) that could potentially explain the tevatron measurements , and for further experimental data .",
    "in particular , the lhc is a natural place to explore high energy top physics , and could potentially provide very instructive data .",
    "however , the measurement of @xmath11 is somewhat subtle at the lhc , because its charge - symmetric @xmath1 initial state does not provide an automatic bias on the initial state partons participating in the reaction . indeed , for the typical @xmath12 initial state mainly responsible for @xmath0 production at the lhc , there is no asymmetry at all .",
    "one is thus forced to rely on the subdominant @xmath13 and @xmath14 initial states , making use of the strong correlation between the rapidity of the @xmath0 system and the direction of the incoming quark .",
    "event - by - event , a positive forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath15 translates into a positive charge asymmetry in the forward regions @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this _ forward - central _ charge asymmetry is ( assuming cp conservation ) a natural lhc observable .    we will study the lhc prospects for measuring this top forward - central charge asymmetry , for both sm and bsm theories designed to explain the tevatron measurement .",
    "we will see that 60 fb@xmath17 at 14 tev will allow for the small sm asymmetry to be observed , while larger asymmetries from models of new physics could be measured much sooner with tens of fb@xmath17 at 7 tev .    ultimately , models which aim to explain the tevatron measurements @xcite may manifest themselves in a variety of ways at the lhc .",
    "in addition to modifications of @xmath11 , virtually all of the candidate theories result in an increase in @xmath0 production at large invariant mass , @xmath7 , and the differential cross section @xmath18 can be a sensitive discriminant between various models @xcite .",
    "in fact , the unprecedented kinematic reach afforded by the lhc may allow production of new states which could contribute only virtually to tevatron processes , revealing new @xmath0 resonances . to this end , we investigate the lhc sensitivity to both resonant and non - resonant modification of the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : afb ] , we introduce a statistically stable definition of the integrated forward - central charge asymmetry and study the lhc sensitivity at @xmath19 and 14 tev . in sections  [ sec : resonance ] and [ sec : contact ] , we consider search prospects for resonances and contact operations in early lhc data .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "as mentioned above , the forward - central charge asymmetry is a natural lhc observable probing the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath20 pair production .",
    "it proceeds by dividing top ( and anti - top ) quarks based on their rapidities @xmath21 between central and forward regions of the detector . the division in rapidity",
    ", @xmath22 defines the forward @xmath23 and central @xmath24 regions , and can be chosen to provide optimum sensitivity to the asymmetry .    for a given @xmath22 ,",
    "we define both a forward charge asymmetry , [ eq : asymmetry1 ] _ f ( y_0 ) = , and a central charge asymmetry , @xmath25 both definitions exploit the fact that the quark parton distribution functions ( pdf ) have more support at large parton @xmath26 than either the gluon or anti - quark pdfs , resulting in an event - by - event correlation between the rapidity of the @xmath0 pair and the incoming quark direction . as a result , a positive forward - backward asymmetry implies that the number of anti - top quarks in the central region is larger than the the number of top quarks , while the total number of top and anti - top quarks integrated over the whole rapidity region is the same ( up to finite @xmath27 acceptance , which we find to be a negligibly small effect ) .",
    "thus , @xmath28 and @xmath29 will have opposite signs .",
    "note that in a given event both the top and the anti - top can be either central or forward ; with the definitions of eq.([eq : asymmetry1 ] ) and eq.([eq : asymmetry2 ] ) , a single event can thus contribute to both @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the two observables are not independent .",
    "since the central region contains a larger proportion of symmetric @xmath12 initiated @xmath0 events , the forward charge asymmetry @xmath30 is a more sensitive probe of the underlying asymmetry in the @xmath0 cross - section . to estimate the potential to measure a charge asymmetry with a specific significance",
    "we define the significance of an asymmetry observable as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the statistical uncertainty on @xmath33 @xmath34 ^ 2 + [ \\delta n_{\\bar{t}}]^2 } } { n_{t } + n_{\\bar{t}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this study we confine ourselves to estimates including statistical uncertainties .",
    "systematics may prove important as well , but require detailed detector simulations which are beyond the scope of this work .      to generate the standard model signal we use mc@nlo @xcite and shower those events with herwig .",
    "we normalize the @xmath35 production cross section for @xmath36 to its sm nnlo rate , @xmath37 @xcite and for @xmath38 to the nlo cross - section obtained from mc@nlo , @xmath39 .",
    "after the selection cuts described below , the only major background is @xmath40 jets , which we generate using alpgen @xcite , applying the mlm matching procedure for up to 5 jets @xcite .",
    "cteq6 m pdfs @xcite are used for the nlo sm processes .    as a representative bsm model which can explain the tevatron measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry",
    ", we choose the flavor - violating @xmath41 model of @xcite at its  best fit \" parameters of @xmath42 and @xmath43  gev .",
    "while this is just one model capable of explaining the tevatron measurement , and its lhc predictions are not particularly representative of the range of possibilities , it does provide a well - motivated example for how the asymmetry could turn out at the lhc if the current tevatron measurements are in fact the result of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we generate @xmath0 production in this model at leading order using madevent @xcite ( with cteq6l pdfs ) showered using pythia @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that should this model actually turn out to be realized , there will be like - sign top and resonances decaying into a top and a light quark which may be observable with smaller data sets than will be necessary to measure a significant asymmetry at the lhc @xcite .",
    "our analysis looks for @xmath0 where one top decays semi - leptonically ( allowing a determination of the parent top charge ) and the other hadronically .",
    "these  lepton + jets \" events strike a balance between the desire to identify the charge of the top through its leptonic decay with a larger branching ratio and thus better statistics on the measurement from the hadronically decaying top .",
    "we proceed by selecting events with exactly one isolated lepton with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "a lepton is considered isolated provided the hadronic transverse energy @xmath46 in a cone of @xmath47 around the lepton is less than @xmath48 of the lepton s transverse energy @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 .    a non - zero asymmetry is entirely the result of @xmath13 and @xmath51 initial states , and it is desirable to impose cuts which select these compared to the dominant @xmath52 initial state ( which exhibits no asymmetry , and thus washes out the measurement ) . the fact that the valence quark pdfs have larger support at large parton @xmath26 than the gluon pdf proves to be useful .",
    "requiring large @xmath35 invariant mass results in a sample with a relatively greater proportion of @xmath13 and @xmath51 initial states , and thus a larger charge asymmetry .",
    "we enforce large @xmath7 by requiring the tops to have large transverse momentum .",
    "this has the drawback of reducing the acceptance , and smaller statistics available for the measurement .",
    "however , this price is offset by the fact that tops at moderate boost ( @xmath53 ) allow for cleaner event reconstruction .",
    "in particular , combinatoric backgrounds are reduced , improving the reconstruction of the parent top rapidity .",
    "modestly boosted tops also offer improvements in @xmath54-tagging efficiency and acceptance of daughter @xmath55 bosons .",
    "such modestly boosted ( hadronically decaying ) top quarks are well suited for reconstruction using the heptoptagger , which is designed to operate on tops with @xmath56 @xcite .    after removing the isolated lepton , we group all remaining visible particles into massless cells of size @xmath57 .",
    "cells with transverse energy above 0.5 gev are retained for jet clustering .",
    "initially , the event is clustered ( using fastjet @xcite ) according to the cambridge - aachen jet - finding algorithm @xcite with a large effective cone size @xmath58 .",
    "we require that the hardest jet have transverse momentum larger than @xmath59 ; we will refer to this jet as the  fat jet \" .",
    "harder @xmath60 cuts result in too much loss of acceptance and ultimately reduce sensitivity to the asymmetry .",
    "we require this jet to be tagged as a top candidate by the heptoptagger @xcite . to suppress the @xmath40jets background we additionally require one @xmath54-tag in the fat jet , for which we assume a @xmath61 tagging efficiency and a @xmath62 fake rate .",
    "note that at the lhc the @xmath40jets background produces more positively charged leptons than negatively charged leptons .",
    "this can fake a bigger positive charge asymmetry than produced from the sm @xmath0 process alone , and it is critical to reduce this background in order to accurately determine the top charge asymmetry . after requiring the hadronic top to be reconstructed using the heptoptagger and demanding the @xmath54 tag , we find that the @xmath40 jets background becomes irrelevant , see table [ tab:14tev ] .",
    "the asymmetries of eq.([eq : asymmetry1 ] ) and eq.([eq : asymmetry2 ] ) depend on the rapidity of the leptonic top as well .",
    "several approaches have been proposed for this purpose @xcite .",
    "here we take the simple approach of identifying the leptonic top rapidity with the lepton rapidity .",
    "the degree of the correlation of the lepton rapidity with that of its parent top depends to some degree on the top polarization @xcite and in principle one could recover additional information from a more careful treatment of the semileptonic top . while the degree of polarization increases with increasing boost ,",
    "so does the kinematic correlation of the lepton rapidity with the top rapidity . in our present study ,",
    "as we have not retained polarization information in modeling the top decays , the lepton rapidity provides a good approximation to the top rapidity regardless of the production mechanism .",
    "a further cut can improve the statistical significance of the asymmetry . after identifying the region with optimal @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "we veto events where both tops are either forward or central .",
    "those events do not contribute to the asymmetry .",
    "although this cut results only in a small increase of the statistical significance to extract the forward asymmetry @xmath63 , it is very effective in removing symmetric gluon - gluon initial states .",
    "thus , by definition , @xmath63 and @xmath64 contain the same information and become equally significant .      ) as a function of @xmath22 , for @xmath30 ( black ) and @xmath65 ( red ) .",

    "are limited by proportionally large systematic errors ; if these errors can be reduced to the percent level , a twofold improvement over the current reported errors , then 2 - 3 @xmath132 sensitivity to large bsm partonic asymmetries may be possible in the tev run , broadly comparable to our results . as our approach is statistics - limited in the early lhc run , the comparison between our results and those of cms naturally raises the question of whether it is possible to improve sensitivity at 7 tev with alternate reconstruction techniques .    in conclusion , we find that @xmath133 can provide an effective measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry of top pair production at the lhc , both in the standard model , as well as in models designed to explain the recent tevatron measurements . boosted top reconstruction proves a helpful tool .",
    "we further study the early prospects for discovery of resonances or contact interactions in @xmath35 production , and find that with small amounts of data , the lhc will extend our knowledge to a large degree .",
    "the lhc is a top quark factory , and in the next years will provide a vista of top completely unseen before now .",
