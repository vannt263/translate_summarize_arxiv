    "luttinger liquids , characteristic of strongly correlated electron systems in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) , represent one of the most interesting examples of non - fermi liquid behaviour , with intricate physical properties without counterpart in higher dimensions , as spin - charge separation @xcite and direct correspondence to bosonic excitations @xcite .",

    ", the system presents an inherent chiral anomaly , as in the case of a @xmath1 schwinger model @xcite , that is a result of the simultaneous requirement of vector current conservation ( charge conservation ) and axial current conservation ( chiral symmetry ) under vector and axial gauge transformations , respectively , appearing in the ward - takahashi identities in the one loop ( 1-loop ) bubble polarizations with intra and interforward interactions @xcite .    applying a full field renormalization group ( rg ) until two loops ( 2-loops ) order , taking into account a renormalization procedure that include the renormalized interband fermi points in the physical prescription",
    ", we will derive the appropriate bare and renormalized quantities that lead to the set of rg flow equations including the renormalized interband fermi points and the quasiparticle weight , considering the physical prescriptions of the one and two - particle irreducible functions until 2-loops order at the fermi surface . in 2-loops , the role of the quasiparticle weight @xmath2 and the corresponding anomalous dimension @xmath3 turns to be important in both self - energy and scattering channels , leading to physically important contributions to the physical properties of the system @xcite , as a consequence we move forward in the previous results @xcite , investigating the reduction of the renormalized interband chiral fermi points to single renormalized chiral fermi points .",
