    "let a physical reference frame ( prf ) be defined by a time - like congruence @xmath0 of world - lines of particles constituting the 3-dimensional reference frame.@xcite the motion of free particles relative to @xmath0 can be described by projecting the equation of motion onto the 3-space of the prf by means of the `` natural splitting . ''",
    "the projected equation can be written in the form@xcite @xmath1 in terms of the gem fields @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , the dynamics of particles , relative to the reference frame @xmath0 , is described in terms of motion under the action of a gem lorentz force , which is obtained without any approximations on fields and velocities . on the basis of the the analogy between the `` classical '' lorentz force and the gem lorentz force ( [ eq : lorentzgem ] )",
    ", we may formally introduce the gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm phase shift and the corresponding time delay@xcite @xmath3 eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) describes the time delay for two massive or massless beams , which propagate in opposite directions along a closed path , with the same velocity in absolute value . because of the gravito - magnetic field ,",
    "the two beams take different times ( as measured by a clock at rest in @xmath0 ) for a round trip , and ( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) expresses this time delay .",
    "in particular , some rotation effects can be thought of as gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effects : this is the case , for instance , of the sagnac effect , both in flat and curved - space time .",

    "gravito - magnetic effects originating from masses rotation can be exploited for measuring the angular momentum of celestial bodies . shapiro _",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite verified the influence of the solar mass on signals propagation , however , in weak field approximation , the time of flight does depend also on the angular momentum , and its contribution has the form@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnitude of the angular momentum , whose direction is supposed to be perpendicular to the plane of propagation of the signals ; @xmath7 is the impact parameter and @xmath8 is a geometrical factor .",
    "the double sign means that the propagation time is shortened on one side of the rotating mass and lengthened on the other side .",
    "the interplay of the motions of the source of electromagnetic signals , the rotating mass and the observer results in a change of the impact parameter in ( [ eq : angmom1 ] ) : this induces a frequency shift@xcite . to fix the ideas ,",
    "let us consider electromagnetic signals coming from a distant source ( such as a star , or a pulsar ) ; these signals , after propagating in the field of the sun , are received by an earth - based observer .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us suppose that the source , the sun and the observer are in the same plane . since the source is much more distant from the sun than the receiver , to first approximation the time variation of the impact parameter is due to the motion of the receiver only . around the occultation of the source by the sun , the impact parameter depends linearly on time and its time variation is approximately given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the apparent velocity of the source in the sky .",
    "if the signal is emitted with a frequency @xmath11 , it is received with a ( slowly varying ) frequency @xmath12 , such that@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the distance of the observer from the rotating body whose mass is @xmath15 .",
    "the order of magnitude of this frequency shift , for a solar system experiment , is@xcite @xmath16 the frequency shift due to the mass has been recently measured by bertotti _ _ et al.__@xcite , using radio pulses from cassini spacecraft .",
    "the angular momentum contribution could be measured by producing interference between the received signals .",
    "in other words , if we record the signal before and after the occultation , and then superimpose them , we get a beating function ( see figure [ fig : beats1 ] ) .",
    "the beating has a basic frequency@xcite @xmath17 which depends on the mass only , and a frequency of amplitude modulation @xmath18 which depends on the angular momentum only : the two effects are then decoupled .",
    "though small , this rotation effect is , in principle , detectable , and it would provide a way for measuring the angular momentum of celestial bodies . more favourable conditions for observing this and other gravito - magnetic effects could be attained by studying the recently observed double pulsar system j0737 - 3039.@xcite"
