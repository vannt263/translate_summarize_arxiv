    "in view of a huge number of dislocations appearing in plastically deformed crystals ( which typically lies in the range @xmath0 dislocations per square meter ) the necessity of developing a physically meaningful continuum dislocation theory ( cdt ) to describe the evolution of dislocation network and predict the formation of microstructure in terms of mechanical and thermal loading conditions becomes clear to all researchers in crystal plasticity .",
    "one of the main guiding principles in seeking such a continuum dislocation theory has first been proposed by @xcite in form of the so - called leds - hypothesis : the true dislocation structure in the final state of deformation minimizes the energy of crystal among all admissible dislocation configurations . in view of numerous experimental evidences supporting this hypothesis ( see , i.e. , @xcite ) , its use in constructing the continuum dislocation theory seems to be quite reasonable and appealing . for the practical realization one needs to i ) specify the whole set of unknown functions and state variables of the continuum dislocation theory , and ii ) lay down the free energy of crystals as their functional to be minimized .",
    "such program has been implemented by @xcite in the linear , and by @xcite in the nonlinear setting of cdt for networks of dislocations , whose lines are straight and remain so during the whole deformation process ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the developed cdt has been successfully applied to various two - dimensional problems of dislocation pileups , bending , torsion , as well as formation of dislocation patterns in single crystals ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention here the similar approaches suggested in @xcite which do not use the leds - hypothesis explicitly but employ instead the extended principle of virtual work for the gradient plasticity .",
    "however , as experiences and experiments show , dislocation lines are in general loops that , as a rule , can change their directions and curvatures depending on the loading condition and crystal s geometry .",
    "therefore the extension of cdt to networks of dislocations whose lines are curves in the slip planes is inevitable . to the best of author s knowledge ,",
    "such three - dimensional continuum dislocation theory based on the leds - hypothesis for curved dislocations has not been developed until now .",
    "it became also clear to him that the latter s absence was due to the missing scalar dislocation densities for the network of curved dislocations .",
    "the first attempt at constructing a continuum theory that can predict in principle not only the dislocation densities but also the direction and curvature of the dislocation lines has been made by @xcite in form of the so - called continuum dislocation dynamics .",
    "their theory starts with the definition of the dislocation density that contains also the information about the orientation and curvature of the dislocation lines .",
    "then the set of kinematic equations is derived for the dislocation density and curvature that requires the knowledge about the dislocation velocity .",
    "the relation between the dislocation density and the macroscopic plastic slip rate via the dislocation velocity is postulated in form of orowan s equation .",
    "the couple system of crystal plasticity and continuum dislocation dynamics becomes closed by the constitutive equation of a flow rule type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the heavy computational cost of such theory , the relation to thermodynamics of crystal plasticity and to the leds - hypothesis is completely lost : the equilibrium solution found in this theory may not minimize the energy of crystal among all admissible dislocation configurations .",
    "let us mention also a continuum approach proposed recently by @xcite in which the three - dimensional dislocation structure is characterized by two families of disregistry functions that may take only integer values .",
    "the dislocation density can then be expressed in their terms .",
    "the coupled system of equations is derived from the underlying discrete dislocation dynamics for the displacement and disregistry functions .",
    "this approach is subject to the same critics as that proposed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the nonlinear continuum dislocation theory ( cdt ) developed recently by @xcite to the case of crystals containing curved dislocations .",
    "provided the dislocation network is regular in the sense that nearby dislocations have nearly the same direction and orientation , we introduce a loop function whose level curves coincide with the dislocation lines . taking an infinitesimal area perpendicular to the dislocation line at some point of the crystal ,",
    "we express the densities of edge and screw dislocations at that point through the resultant burgers vectors of dislocations whose lines cross this area at right angle . such scalar densities contain not only the information about the number of dislocations , but also the information about the orientation and curvature of the dislocation lines . in case of dislocation motion",
    "we introduce the vector of normal velocity of dislocation line through the time derivative of the loop function . following @xcite and",
    "@xcite we require that the free energy density of crystal depends only on the elastic strain tensor and on the above scalar densities of dislocations .",
    "then we formulate a new variational principle of cdt according to which the placement , the plastic slip , and the loop function in the final state of equilibrium minimize the free energy functional among all admissible functions .",
    "we derive from this variational principle a new set of equilibrium equations , boundary conditions , and constitutive equations for these unknown functions . in case",
    "the resistance to dislocation motion is significant , the variational principle must be replaced by the variational equation that takes the dissipation into account .",
    "the constructed theory is generalized for single crystals having a finite number of active slip systems .",
    "we provide also the simplifications of the theory for small strains .",
    "as compared to the continuum dislocation dynamics proposed in @xcite our theory is advantageous not only in the computational cost due to its simplicity , but also in its full consistency with the leds - hypothesis . in the problem of single crystal beam having only one active slip system and deforming in simple shear , the energy minimization problem reduces to the two - dimensional variational problem .",
    "we solve this problem analytically for the circular cross section and asymptotically for the rectangular cross section .",
    "we will show that this solution reduces to that found in @xcite for the crystals with thin and long cross - section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this short introduction we present in section 2 the three - dimensional kinematics for single crystals deforming in single slip .",
    "section 3 formulates the variational principles of the three - dimensional cdt and derives its governing equations .",
    "section 4 extends this nonlinear theory to the case of single crystals with @xmath1 active slip system .",
    "section 5 studies the three - dimensional small strain cdt .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the analytical and asymptotic solutions of the two - dimensional energy minimization problem of a single crystal beam deforming in simple shear .",
    "finally , section 7 concludes the paper .",
    "nonlinear cdt starts from the basic kinematic resolution of the deformation gradient @xmath2 into elastic and plastic parts @xcite @xmath3 we attribute an active role to the plastic deformation : @xmath4 is the deformation _ creating _ dislocations ( either inside or at the boundary of the volume element ) or _ changing _ their positions in the crystal without distorting the lattice parallelism ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nhslip ] ) . on the contrary , the elastic deformation @xmath5 deforms the crystal lattice having _ frozen _ dislocations @xcite .",
    "note that the lattice vectors remain unchanged when the plastic deformation is applied , while they change together with the shape vectors by the elastic deformation .",
    "we consider first a single crystal deforming in single slip . in this case",
    "let us denote the right - handed triad of unit lattice vectors of the active slip system by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , where @xmath6 points to the slip direction , @xmath7 lies in the slip plane and is perpendicular to @xmath6 , and @xmath8 is normal to the slip plane . without restricting generality",
    "we may choose the rectangular cartesian coordinate system @xmath9 in the reference configuration such that its basis vectors coincide with these lattice vectors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] ) @xmath10 the plastic deformation is then given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the plastic slip .",
    "we assume that all dislocations causing this plastic deformation lie completely in the slip planes and the dislocation network is regular in the sense that nearby dislocations have nearly the same direction and orientation .",
    "this enables one to introduce a scalar function @xmath13 ( called a loop function ) such that its level curves @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being constants , coincide with the dislocation lines .",
    "thus , in this three - dimensional kinematics we admit , according to equation , only the conservative motion of dislocations and exclude from consideration the dislocation climb which is an important mechanism of temperature - dependent creep .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 and @xmath18 the plane unit vectors normal and tangential to the dislocation line . from equation follow @xmath19",
    "where the comma before an index denotes the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding coordinate .",
    "note that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath8 form a right - handed basis vectors of the three - dimensional space ( see fig .  [ fig : loop ] ) .",
    "@xcite introduced the resultant burgers vector of excess dislocations , whose lines cross the area @xmath20 in the reference configuration , in the following way @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the close contour surrounding @xmath20 . @xcite",
    "have shown that , in the continuum limit , when the atomic distance goes to zero at the fixed sizes of the representative volume element and the fixed density of dislocations per area of unit cell , integral gives the total closure failure induced by @xmath4 which must be equal to the resultant burgers vector .",
    "it is natural to assume @xmath4 continuously differentiable in this continuum limit , so , applying stoke s theorem we get from @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the vector product , @xmath25 the surface element , and @xmath26 the unit vector normal to @xmath20 .",
    "this legitimates the introduction of the dislocation density tensor @xmath27 for the plastic deformation taken from @xmath28 if we choose now an infinitesimal area @xmath25 with the unit normal vector @xmath18 , then the resultant burgers vector of all excess dislocations , whose dislocation lines cross this area at right angle is given by @xmath29 this resultant burgers vector can be decomposed into the sum of two vectors @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the projections of the slip vector onto the normal and tangential direction to the dislocation line , respectively .",
    "this allows us to define two scalar densities ( or the numbers of excess dislocations per unit area ) of edge and screw dislocations @xmath33 with @xmath34 the magnitude of burgers vector .",
    "we see that the three - dimensional dislocation densities @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on both the gradient of the plastic slip and the gradient of the loop function @xmath37 through the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "consider now the case of motion of dislocation loops in the slip plane . in this case",
    "we allow the loop function to depend explicitly on time @xmath38 such that equation @xmath39 with fixed constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 describes one and the same dislocation line during its motion in the slip plane . letting @xmath40 be the variable along the dislocation line , we may represent the level curve defined by in the parametric form @xmath41 fixing @xmath40 and taking the differential of we obtain @xmath42 that yields @xmath43 since @xmath44 is the velocity of the fixed point on the dislocation line with coordinate @xmath40 , we define the normal velocity of the dislocation line as follows @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "this kinematic quantity will be used in the case of non - vanishing resistance to dislocation motion .",
    "according to @xcite , the elastic deformation @xmath5 and the dislocation densities @xmath35 and @xmath36 characterize the current state of the crystal , so these quantities are the state variables of the continuum dislocation theory .",
    "the reason why the plastic deformation @xmath4 can not be qualified for the state variable is that it depends on the cut surfaces and consequently on the whole history of creating dislocations .",
    "likewise , the gradient of plastic strain tensor @xmath47 can not be used as the state variable by the same reason . in contrary , the dislocation densities depend only on the characteristics of dislocations in the current state ( burgers vector and positions of dislocation lines ) and not on how they are created , so @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in addition to @xmath5 , are the proper state variables .",
    "thus , if we consider isothermal processes of deformation , then the free energy per unit volume of crystal ( assumed as macroscopically homogeneous ) must be a function of @xmath5 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xmath48 now , if we superimpose an elastic rotation @xmath49 onto the actual deformation of the body , then the total and elastic deformation change according to @xmath50 at the same time , the dislocation densities @xmath35 and @xmath36 remain unchanged . as such superimposed elastic rotation does not change the elastic strain and the dislocation densities , we expect that the energy remains unchanged . the standard argument",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) leads then to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the elastic strain defined by @xmath53    let the undeformed single crystal occupy some region @xmath54 of the three - dimensional space .",
    "the boundary of this region , @xmath55 , is assumed to be the closure of union of two non - intersecting surfaces , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "let the placement be a given smooth function of coordinates @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the given displacement vector .",
    "such condition does not admit dislocations to reach this part @xmath56 of the boundary , so we set @xmath60 at the remaining part @xmath57 the `` dead '' load ( traction ) @xmath61 is specified .",
    "note that , in case the whole boundary is free , we do not have any kinematic constraint at @xmath55 .",
    "however , as the energy density is invariant with respect to the shift of the loop function @xmath37 on an arbitrary constant which does not change the dislocation densities , we can impose on this scalar function the following constraint @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the volume element . if no body force acts on this crystal , then its energy functional is defined as @xmath64=\\int_{\\mathcal{v}}w(\\mathbf{f},\\beta , \\nabla \\beta , \\nabla l)\\ , dx-\\int_{\\partial _ s } \\mathbf{t } \\cdot \\mathbf{y}\\ , da,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 provided the resistance to the dislocation motion is negligibly small and no surfaces of discontinuity occur inside crystals , then the following variational principle is valid for single crystals with one active slip system : the true placement vector @xmath66 , the true plastic slip @xmath67 , and the true loop function @xmath68 in the _ final _ equilibrium state of deformation minimize energy functional among all continuously differentiable fields @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath37 satisfying constraints and .",
