    "one of the fundamental challenges faced by the wireless communication industry is how to meet rapidly growing demands for wireless services and applications with limited radio spectrum . cognitive radio ( cr ) technology has been proposed as a promising solution to tackle such a challenge @xcite . in a spectrum sharing based cr network , the secondary users ( sus )",
    "are allowed to coexist with the primary user ( pu ) , subject to the constraint , namely the interference constraint , that the interference power from the su to the pu is less than an acceptable value .",
    "evidently , the purpose of the imposed interference constraint is to ensure that the quality of service ( qos ) of the pu is not degraded due to the sus . to be aware of",
    "whether the interference constraint is satisfied , the sus needs obtain knowledge of the radio environment cognitively .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a spectrum sharing based cr communication scenario , in which the su uses a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) channel and the primary user ( pu ) has one receive antenna .",
    "we assume that the channel state information ( csi ) about the su link is perfectly known at the su transmitter ( su - tx ) .",
    "however , owing to loose cooperation between the su and the pu , only the mean and covariance of the channel between the su - tx and the pu is available at the su - tx . with this csi ,",
    "our design objective is , for a given transmit power constraint , to determine the transmit signal covariance matrix that maximizes the rate of the su while keeping the interference power to the pu below a threshold for all the possible channel realizations within an uncertainty set .",
    "we term this design problem the robust cognitive beamforming design problem .    in non - cr settings ,",
    "the study of multiple antenna systems with partial csi has received considerable attention in the past @xcite .",
    "specifically , the paper @xcite considers the case in which the receiver has perfect csi but the transmitter has only partial csi ( mean feedback or covariance feedback ) . it was proved in @xcite that the optimal transmission directions are the same as those of the eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrix .",
    "however , the optimal power allocation solution was not given in an analytical form .",
    "a universal optimality condition for beamforming was explored in @xcite , and quantized feedback was studied in @xcite .    in cr settings ,",
    "power allocation strategies have been developed for multiple access channels ( mac ) @xcite and for point - to - point multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels @xcite .",
    "particularly , the solution developed in @xcite can be viewed as cognitive beamforming since the su - tx forms its main beam direction with awareness of its interference to the pu .",
    "a closed - form method has been present in @xcite .",
    "a water - filling based algorithm is proposed in @xcite to obtain the suboptimal power allocation strategy .",
    "however , the papers @xcite and @xcite assume that perfect csi about the link from the su - tx to the pu is available at the su - tx .",
    "due to loose cooperation between the su and the pu , it could be difficult or even infeasible for the su - tx to acquire accurate csi between the su - tx to the pu .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the robust cognitive beamforming design problem as a semi - infinite programming ( sip ) problem , which is difficult to solve directly .",
    "the contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "several important properties of the optimal solution of the sip problem , the rank-1 property , and the sufficient and necessary conditions of the optimal solution , are presented .",
    "these properties would transform the sip problem into a finite constraint optimization problem .",
    "2 .   based on these properties ,",
    "we show that the sip problem can be transformed into a second order cone programming ( socp ) problem , which can be solved via a standard interior point algorithm .",
    "3 .   by exploiting the geometric properties of the optimal solution , a closed - form solution for the sip problem",
    "is also provided .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : model ] describes the su miso communication system model , and the problem formulation of the robust cognitive beamforming design .",
    "section [ section : robust ] presents several important lemmas that are used to develop the algorithms .",
    "two different algorithms , the socp based solution and the analytical solution , are developed in section [ section : geo ] and section [ section : sdp ] , respectively .",
    "section [ section : simulation ] presents simulation examples , and finally , section [ section : conclusion ] concludes the paper .    the following notation is used in this paper .",
    "boldface upper and lower case letters are used to denote matrices and vectors , respectively , @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote the conjugate transpose and transpose , respectively , @xmath2 denotes an identity matrix , @xmath3 denotes the trace operation , and @xmath4 denotes the rank of the matrix @xmath5 .",
    "with reference to fig . [",
    "fig : sysmodel ] , we consider a point - to - point su miso communication system , where the su has @xmath6 transmit antennas and a single receive antenna .",
    "the signal model of the su can be represented as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the received and transmitted signals respectively , @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11 channel response from the su - tx to the su - rx , and @xmath12 is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance can be viewed as the summation of the interference and the noise .",
    "the variance of @xmath12 does not influence the algorithms discussed later .",
    "moreover , the variance of @xmath12 can be measured at the su receiver @xcite . ] .",
    "suppose that the pu has one receive antenna .",
    "the channel response from the su - tx to the pu is denoted by an @xmath13 vector @xmath14 .",
    "further , assume that the su - tx has perfect csi for its own link , i.e. , @xmath10 is perfectly known at the su - tx . however , due to the loose cooperation between the su and the pu , only partial csi about @xmath14 is assumed to be available at the su - tx .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mean and covariance of @xmath14 , respectively and @xmath16 are known to the su . ] . in previous work",
    "@xcite , partial csi has been considered in two extreme cases in a non - cr setting .",
    "one is the mean feedback case , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 can be viewed as the variance of the estimation error ; and the other is the covariance feedback case , where @xmath15 is a zero vector . in this paper",
    ", we study the case where the su - tx knows both the mean and covariance of @xmath14 in a cr setting .",
    "the objective of this paper is to determine the optimal transmit signal covariance matrix such that the information rate of the su link is maximized while the qos of the pu is guaranteed under a robust design scenario , i.e. , the instantaneous interference power for the pu should remain below a given threshold for all the @xmath14 in the uncertain region .",
    "mathematically , the problem is formulated as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the transmit signal covariance matrix , @xmath21 is the transmit power budget , @xmath22 is the interference threshold of the pu , and @xmath23 is a positive constant . the parameter @xmath23 characterizes the uncertainty of @xmath14 at the su . according to the definition of the uncertainty in @xcite , @xmath24 belongs to a type of ellipsoid uncertainty problem , i.e. , the uncertain parameter @xmath14 is confined in a range of an ellipsoid @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the optimal solution of problem @xmath24 can guarantee the interference power constraint of the pu for all the @xmath27 , and thus the robustness of @xmath24 is in the _ worst case _",
    "sense @xcite , i.e. , in the worst case channel realization , the interference constraint should also be satisfied .",
    "if the primary transmission does not exist , then the interference constraint is excluded , and thus the problem reduces to a trivial beamforming problem .",
    "hence , we only focus on the case where the both pu and su transmission exist .    [",
    "remark : rotation ] an important observation is that the objective function in problem @xmath24 remains invariant when @xmath10 undergoes an arbitrary phase rotation . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume , in the sequel , that @xmath10 and @xmath15 have the same phase , i.e. , @xmath28 .    since problem",
    "@xmath24 has a finite number of decision variable @xmath20 , and is subjected to an infinite number of constraints with respect to the compact set @xmath25 , problem @xmath24 is an sip problem @xcite .",
    "one obvious approach for an sip problem is to transform it into a finite constraint problem .",
    "however , there is no universal algorithm to determine the equivalent finite constraints such that the transformed problem has the same solution as the original sip problem . in the following section",
    ", we first study several important properties of problem @xmath24 , which would be used to transform the sip problem into its equivalent finite constraint counterpart .",
    "the maximization problem @xmath24 is a convex optimization problem , and thus has a unique optimal solution .",
    "the following lemma presents a key property of the optimal solution of problem @xmath24 ( see appendix [ section : prof1d ] for the proof ) .",
    "[ lemma:1d ] the optimal covariance matrix @xmath20 for problem @xmath24 is a rank-1 matrix .",
    "[ remark : vp ] lemma [ lemma:1d ] indicates that beamforming is the optimal transmission strategy for problem @xmath24 , and the optimal transmit covariance matrix can be expressed as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the optimal transmit power and @xmath31 is the optimal beamforming vector with @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the ultimate objective of problem @xmath24 is to determine @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    according to lemma [ lemma:1d ] ,",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal solution of problem @xmath24 is presented as follows ( refer to appendix [ section : profcond ] for the proof ) .",
    "[ lemma : cond ] a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath33 to be the globally optimal solution of problem @xmath24 is that there exists an @xmath34 such that @xmath35 where @xmath36    the vector @xmath34 is a key element for all @xmath37 , in the sense that , for the optimal solution , the constraint @xmath38 dominates the whole interference constraints , i.e. , all the other interference constraints are inactive .",
    "thus , if we can determine @xmath34 , the sip problem @xmath24 is transformed into a finite constraint problem .",
    "it is worth noting that the problem has the same form as the problem discuss in @xcite , in which the csi on the link of the su and the link between su - tx and pu are perfectly known at the su - tx .",
    "however , unlike the problem in @xcite , @xmath34 in is an unknown parameter .    in the following lemma ( see appendix [ section : prov2d ] for the proof ) , the optimal beamforming vector @xmath31 is shown to lie in a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) space spanned by @xmath15 and the projection of @xmath10 into the null space of @xmath15 .",

    "in this section , we solve problem @xmath24 via a standard interior point algorithm @xcite .",
    "we first transform the sip problem into a finite constraint problem , and further transform it into a standard socp form , which can be solved by using a standard software package such as sedumi @xcite .",
    "one key observation is that if @xmath48 , i.e. , the worst case interference constraint of @xmath24 is satisfied , then the interference constraint of @xmath24 holds . combining this observation with lemma",

    "until the ratio @xmath167 reaches a certain value , the achievable rate remains unchanged , since the transmit power constraint dominates the result , and the interference constraint becomes inactive .      in this simulation , we compare the achieved rates of problem @xmath24 with a single transmit power constraint , a single interference constraint and both constraints . here , we choose @xmath165 , @xmath173 , and generate @xmath16 in the same way as in the first simulation example .",
    "[ fig : activity ] plots three achievable rates for different constraints , respectively . it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : activity ] that the rate under two constraints is always less than or equal to the rate under a single constraint .",
    "obviously , this is due to the fact that extra constraints reduce the degree of freedom of the transmitter .",
    "in this paper , the robust cognitive beamforming design problem has been investigated , for the su miso communication system in which only partial csi of the link from the su - tx to the pu is available at the su - tx .",
    "the problem can be formulated as an sip optimization problem .",
    "two approaches have been proposed to obtain the optimal solution of the problem ; one approach is based on a standard interior point algorithm , while the other approach solves the problem analytically .",
    "simulation examples have been used to present a comparison of the two approaches as well as to study the effectiveness and activeness of imposed constraints .",
    "this work initiates research in robust design of cognitive radios .",
    "we are currently extending these methods to the more general case with multiple receive antennas and multiple pus .",
    "other interesting extensions include more practical scenarios , such as the case in which the su channel information is also partially known at the su - tx .",
    "problem @xmath24 involves infinitely many constraints .",
    "denote the set of active constraints by @xmath174 , the cardinality of the set @xmath174 by @xmath175 , and the channel response related to the @xmath176th element of the set @xmath174 by @xmath177 . according to the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions for @xmath24",
    ", we have : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the dual variable associated with the constraint @xmath180 , and @xmath181 and @xmath182 are the dual variables associated with the transmit power constraint and the interference constraint , respectively .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath183 , and thus the rank of the right hand side of is @xmath6 . since the first term on the left hand side of has rank one , we have @xmath184 moreover , since @xmath180 and @xmath185 , from we have @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the eigenvalue decomposition of matrix @xmath179 , and @xmath188 . by applying eigenvalue decomposition to @xmath189 , we have @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the @xmath192th eigenvalue and @xmath193 is the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "we next show @xmath194 by contradiction .",
    "suppose that @xmath195 .",
    "then , there exists an index @xmath196 such that the @xmath196th element of @xmath193 and the @xmath196th diagonal element of @xmath197 are non - zero simultaneously .",
    "thus , it is impossible that the equation @xmath198 holds .",
    "it follows that @xmath199 . combining this with",
    ", we have @xmath200 .",
    "second , we assume that @xmath201 in . in this case , @xmath20 must lie in the space spanned by @xmath202 , @xmath203 .",
    "let the dimensionality of the space be @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , we can restrict @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the reminder of the proof is the same as that of the case @xmath206 , and the proof is complete.@xmath207      first , we consider the sufficiency part of this lemma .",
    "we assume that there exists a covariance matrix @xmath33 and an @xmath34 that satisfy the conditions and simultaneously . since @xmath33 satisfies both the transmit power constraint and the interference constraint",
    ", @xmath33 is a feasible solution for problem @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , if we assume that there exists another solution @xmath208 , which results in a larger achievable rate for the su link , then a contradiction will be derived . without loss of generality , we assume that the constraint set , which consists of all the active interference constraints for @xmath208 , is denoted by @xmath209 .",
    "we divide the set @xmath209 into two types : one type is @xmath210 , and the other type is @xmath211 .",
    "assume that @xmath212 and @xmath213 are the achievable rates for the covariance matrices @xmath208 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "in the case of @xmath210 , we have @xmath214 , since @xmath213 is obtained with fewer constraints . since problem @xmath24 is a convex optimization problem that has a unique optimal solution , @xmath33 is indeed the optimal solution . in the case of @xmath211 , we can observe that @xmath33 satisfies the constraints in @xmath209 , and @xmath208 satisfies the constraint @xmath34 .",
    "according to the lemma in @xcite , this case does not exist .",
    "we next proceed to prove the necessity part .",
    "suppose that @xmath33 is the optimal solution of problem @xmath24 .",
    "according to lemma [ lemma:1d ] , we have @xmath29 .",
    "thus , problem @xmath24 is equivalent to @xmath215    according to lemma [ lemma : par ] , there is a unique @xmath216 which is the optimal solution of @xmath217 .",
    "thus , for problem , only @xmath218 and @xmath219 are active constraints .",
    "thus , it is obvious that problem and problem have the same optimal solution .",
    "hence , the proof is complete . @xmath207",
    "the proof of lemma [ lemma : twodimension ] is divided into two parts .",
    "the first part is to prove that @xmath31 is in the form of @xmath220 , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "the second part is to prove @xmath223 and @xmath224 . in the following proof",
    ", we assume that @xmath225 are some proper complex scalars .    according to lemma [ lemma : cond ] , and theorem 2 in @xcite ,",
    "we have @xmath226 according to lemma [ lemma : par ] , we have @xmath227 according to , it can be observed that @xmath34 can be expressed by the linear combination of @xmath15 and @xmath10 , where the coefficients are complex . combining this with",
    ", we have @xmath228 where @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "moreover , since both @xmath15 and @xmath10 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we have @xmath231 since rotating @xmath31 does not affect the final result , we can assume @xmath223 .",
    "we next prove that @xmath232 by contradiction . at first",
    ", we assume that @xmath233 .",
    "then we can find an equivalent @xmath234 which is a better solution of problem @xmath24 than @xmath235 .",
    "assume that @xmath236 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath237 , and the interference caused by @xmath238 is @xmath239 which is equal to that of @xmath31 .",
    "however , the corresponding objective function with @xmath238 is @xmath240 and the objective value with @xmath31 is @xmath241          the objective function @xmath244 is a convex function .",
    "the duality gap for a convex maximization problem is zero .",
    "the lagrangian function is @xmath245 where @xmath181 is the lagrange multiplier . according to the kkt condition , we have @xmath246 thus , @xmath247 we have @xmath248 , where @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 . since @xmath252",
    ", we have @xmath253 .",
    "moreover , by observing , we have @xmath254 where @xmath255 is a real scalar such that @xmath256 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath257 .",
    "the proof follows immediately .",
    "assume that @xmath33 is the optimal solution for problem @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath118 satisfies the interference constraint , then @xmath118 is a feasible solution for problem @xmath80 .",
    "the optimal rate achieved by @xmath33 can not be larger than that of @xmath118 , since the constraint of @xmath82 is a subset of problem @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , we can prove the second part of the lemma .",
    "we now focus on the third part of this lemma . for problem @xmath80 ,",
    "at least one of @xmath262 and @xmath38 is an active constraint , since if neither of them is active , we can always find an @xmath23 such that @xmath263 is a feasible and better solution . moreover , if only @xmath262 is active , then @xmath118 is the optimal solution , which contradicts with @xmath264 .",
