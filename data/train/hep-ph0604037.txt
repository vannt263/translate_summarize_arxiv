    "theory that describes the dynamics of phase transition to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and back to hadronic matter is still failed . in high - energy experiments ,",
    "we can only measure produced particles in the final state , i.e. , after chemical and thermal freeze - outs .",
    "consequently , occurrence of equilibration processes while energy density decreases can not be confirmed experimentally .",
    "same statement is valid for degrees of freedom during hadronization processes .",
    "it is known that thermal models work well in the final state .",
    "they presume a charge - conserved hadronic phase and have no access to phase transition . in other words ,",
    "the phenomenology of qgp and particularly the dynamics of phase transition seems to represent a kind of black box .",
    "this might explain why we used to assume that the deconfinement temperature @xmath0 at small chemical potential is coincident with the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "what are the consequences of this assumption ?",
    "for example , what type of strongly interacting matter we have in mind that undergoes a phase transition back to confined hadrons , very much rapidly expands and finally freezes out through chemical processes without any change in its temperature ? is it possible to describe it by qcd ? or should we assume that the chemical freeze - out does not exist ?",
    "although the energy density available in heavy - ion collisions at cern - sps  @xcite and now at bnl - rhic  @xcite exceeds the critical value calculated in lattice qcd ( @xmath2gev@xmath3@xmath4 ) , many physicists still debate on qgp signatures under these laboratory conditions .",
    "if should hold at small chemical potentials , phenomenological signals that characterize phase transition should remain measurable in the final state .",
    "at least qgp signatures that are not sensitive to a medium , such as color screening or @xmath5 dissociation into two leptons have to survive at . on the basis of current experimental and theoretical progress",
    ", we can think of other solutions , like @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 , then qgp signatures are very much contaminated ( in - medium - modified ) so that the final state does not reflect qgp production .",
    "furthermore , we can assume that the production of qgp requires much higher temperature than the currently available temperature at rhic  @xcite .",
    "qcd predicts that matter under extreme conditions is simple but it does not say anything about matter being ideally formed . for temperatures larger than @xmath7 ,",
    "the matter is in a deconfined phase .",
    "only a good understanding of the dynamics of phase transition will help us to characterize qgp .",
    "the end of the hadron era was predicted fifty five years ago  @xcite . no doubt that hadrons will go into a new state of matter at sufficiently high temperatures and densities  @xcite . the wide acceptable framework to study the phase transition of strongly interacting matter",
    "is given by qcd .",
    "qcd predicts that the hot hadronic matter becomes simple .",
    "this is not necessarily weakly interacting .",
    "qcd has been studied on a lattice for the past thirty years ; qcd lagrangian has to be discretized and everything has to be put on a finite a space - time lattice .",
    "it has been shown that a change in the phase of matter undoubtedly exists at sufficiently high energy densities .",
    "the degree of freedom markedly increases in a relative narrow region of temperatures . for a purely gluonic system , for which the equation of state can be computed without approximations ,",
    "there is a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "it is of the first order and the critical temperature is @xmath8mev  @xcite .",
    "the difficulties in lattice calculations start when the fermion sector is switched on .",
    "nevertheless , it has also been observed that the chiral symmetry is restored at the same critical temperature @xmath9mev ( depending of quark flavors ) as that of deconfinement transition .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry means that the effective mass of quarks forming the hadron states becomes zero .",
    "another important consequence of chiral symmetry breaking restoration is the disappearance of the mass degeneracy of hadronic states with the same spin but different parity quantum numbers .",
    "dynamical quarks can only be included in lattice qcd in certain approximations .",
    "the order of phase transition in full qcd is not yet completely known .",
    "we merely see a rapid change in bulk thermodynamic quantities .",
    "consequently , the transition is known as cross - over .",
    "the behavior of qcd phase transition at a finite chemical potential is not yet known from first principle of qcd . nevertheless , if we look at the lattice results at a zero chemical potential , fig .",

    "it seems that @xmath12 will remain constant at higher temperatures .",

    "this is also valid at finite chemical potentials .",
    "apart from the known properties of lattice calculations , like heavy quark masses and finite lattice size and spacing , we have from this figure evidence that hadrons undergo a transition to a strongly correlated phase .",

    "using elliptic flow , it was possible to conclude that rhic has produced thermalized matter at a very high energy density  .",
    "for the first time , hydrodynamics with a zero viscosity can describe heavy - ion reactions .",
    "in relativistic hydrodynamics , under the assumption of local thermalization , the number density , current and energy - momentum tensors are @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the shear and bulk viscosities , respectively . the number density and entropy density are conserved . in strongly interacting quantum fields ,",

    "as mentioned above , the properties of new state of matter are studied in lattice qcd in quenched approximation  @xcite .",
    "the lattice results have to be interpreted with respect to all these approximations .",

    "as mentioned above , rhic results imply that the new state of matter is a fluid rather than a free gas .",
    "on the other hand , when we think about the situation that , in heavy - ion experiments , one starts and ends up with hadrons , we realize that the experimental proof is non trivial .",

    "also there are many lines of evidence that deconfined matter don not behave like free gas .",
    "for example , gluon condensates  @xcite remain finite above @xmath0 .",
    "gluon condensates have been calculated at a finite temperature and in the presence of massive quarks  @xcite .",
    "it has been assumed that such quarks due to strong interactions will modify the thermal properties of gluon condensates .",
