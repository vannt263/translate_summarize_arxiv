    "unshared or despotic decisions appear in hierarchical species , where one or a few leaders dominate and influence its conspecifics @xcite .",
    "this social structure has been widely reported in several animal species such as pigeons @xcite , cattle @xcite , dwarf mongooses @xcite , dolphins @xcite and many primates as for instance rhesus macaques @xcite , black spider monkeys @xcite , chimpanzees @xcite or yellow baboons @xcite ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the context of animal movement , which is the focus of this paper ,",
    "leaders usually initiate the movement , persuading the rest of the group to follow their steps to maintain cohesion .",
    "thus , communication together with individual experience induces the formation of groups @xcite .",
    "a leader decides where to move based on its own knowledge and , due to its influence on the group , it may recruit some conspecifics who follow its movements .",
    "this displacement strategy may be used to increase defense , predation or foraging success @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the situation where a leader has beforehand information about the location of resources and moves towards them .",
    "this informed individual , characterized by a persuading force whose strength might depend on some of its attributes like size , personality , etc .",
    ", is able to tune its speed in order to increase its influence on the movement of the group and recruit more conspecifics . thus , if for any reason animals do not follow the leader , the group may split into smaller groups , as it happens in the so - called fission - fusion societies observed in elephants , dolphins , some ungulates and primates @xcite .",
    "however , following the informed leader may incidentally benefit uninformed individuals that , apart from being protected by the group , may obtain other advantages like knowledge about the location of resources .",
    "we quantify these benefits in terms of the first - passage probability of arriving at the target and explore how the interaction with a leader may affect searching processes .",
    "we analyze the likelihood that an uninformed member finds a specific target , and how that depends on the speeds and interaction parameters of the informed individuals . in a second part",
    ", we extend our scenario to the case where several leaders compete for an uninformed individual and address the question of when a minority group of informed individuals can beat a majority @xcite .",
    "this scenario differs from previous studies where a whole population searches collectively for food .",
    "this last behavior is more frequent in democratic species as it has been reported in recent works where fish schools explore complex environments @xcite .",
    "conspecifics act as an `` array of sensors '' to pool their information and better average their movement decisions @xcite .    from a physical point of view , first - passage problems are of fundamental relevance for stochastic processes , and have been studied in systems of non - interacting brownian particles in various scenarios , such as those subject to external potentials , with different boundary conditions or under different diffusion coefficients @xcite . some recent related work has dealt with interacting active particles but focusing on the collective properties of the system @xcite and pattern formation @xcite , rather than in searching ( first - passage properties ) tasks . an interaction mechanism and its influence on high - order statistics , the general aim of this paper , has therefore not been thoroughly studied yet .",
    "only few recent studies have investigated its effect on first - passage properties within a searching context @xcite , concluding that the optimal situation where the group is benefited as a whole is a mixture of independent searching and joining other members in the search .",
    "it was shown that this conclusion is independent on the mobility pattern , either lvy or brownian @xcite .",

    "the paper ends with a summary and conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in its simplest version , the model mimics the behavior of two interacting animals , a leader and its follower .",

    "particle @xmath0 jumps with rate @xmath6 to its right neighboring site ( left jumps are forbidden ) .",
    "note that since the dynamics is defined on continuous time , a jumping rate @xmath6 implies that the probability of jumping in an infinitesimal time step @xmath7 is @xmath8 .",
    "particle @xmath1 jumps with a rate @xmath9 that depends on whether its distance @xmath10 to the particle @xmath0 is smaller or larger than an interaction range @xmath11 .",
    "we denote here by @xmath12 and @xmath13 the positions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively .",

    "then , the total majority strength @xmath199 acting on @xmath1 matches that of the minority . with these parameters ,",
    "the two targets seem to be equivalent , as it happens for the case of two identical informed particles studied en section [ twoinformed ] . however , as we observe in fig .",

    "when both the majority and the minority set their speeds equal and close to the single - particle optimal speed @xmath30 , the minority is more efficient in dragging @xmath1 to its target .",
    "seemingly , the fact that the total strength @xmath199 of the majority is divided among two particles causes a less effective dragging force on @xmath1 than that caused by a single particle with strength @xmath202 .",
    "an insight about this result can be obtained with the following reasoning .",
    "if both particles in the majority would move together in perfect synchrony , then their interaction ranges would always overlap along the path to the target , and they would behave as a single particle with strength @xmath199 . however , stochasticity in the jumping process splits particles apart , introducing two competing effects . on the one hand ,",
    "the total interaction range composed by the range of the two left - moving particles is larger than that of the right - moving particle , seemingly inducing an effective left drag over @xmath1 .",
    "but , on the other hand , the strength of this total interaction range is @xmath202 only where the ranges of both left - moving particles overlap , and @xmath26 where they do not overlap , which is only half of the strength of the right - moving particle .",
    "apparently , this last mechanism induced by the difference in strengths is stronger than the effect produced by enlarging the interaction range , consequently breaking the symmetry in favor of the right target .     and one to the right at speed @xmath194 .",

    "the probability that the uninformed particle reaches the minority ( right ) target are largest for most combinations of speeds @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( white region).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "in this article we have presented a minimalist approach to study how the presence of a leader in a group of animals may influence the movement of its conspecifics and incidentally their searching efficiency .",
    "the model has two types of individuals : informed leaders that move ballistically at speed @xmath6 towards the location of a known target , and uninformed searchers that are attracted towards leaders when they are close enough , but they freely diffuse with rate @xmath9 otherwise . to quantify the benefits of following the leader , we have focused on the probability @xmath29 that the uninformed searcher finds a specific target @xmath5 , and studied how that depends on @xmath6 , @xmath9 and the internal attraction strength @xmath26 .",
    "we started analyzing the simplest case where there is only one individual of each type .",
    "we found that the first - passage probability @xmath29 is non - monotonic and reaches its maximum at an intermediate value @xmath30 that is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , searching efficiency is maximized when the informed particle moves at intermediate speeds , as compared to the diffusion of the uninformed particle . if it moves too fast there is almost no interaction , and if it moves too slow the interaction has almost no net effect on the final destination of the uninformed particle , which is not able to take advantage of the information exchange . moving not too fast but also not too slow seems to be the optimal strategy to recruit undecided particles when they have a fixed diffusion rate .",
    "then , we considered a more general situation in which two identical leaders moving in opposite directions compete for an uninformed individual .",
    "it turns out that the particle that adapts its speed to a value closer to the optimal speed @xmath30 has the largest chances to win .",
    "surprisingly , a tie is obtained for a nontrivial relationship between the speed of both particles , besides the case where they move at the same speed .",
    "when a group of two leaders compete against a single particle group , the largest group wins for most combinations of speeds , as its combined effective persuading force is stronger .",
    "however , this situation is reversed when the social strength of the smaller group is doubled .",
    "therefore , by following two different strategies a minority may be able to beat a majority : either by increasing its internal strength or by adapting its speed to an optimal value relative to the speed of the majority",
    ".    it would be worthwhile to explore some extensions of the model that include , for instance , many uninformed particles that interact not only with the leaders but also between them .",
    "also , in a more realistic scenario informed particles would not be identical but each would have a different strength and range of interaction , and they may also have some diffusion , instead of the pure ballistic motion considered in the present work .",

    "<S> we introduce a model of interacting random walkers on a finite one dimensional chain with absorbing boundaries or targets at the ends . </S>",
    "<S> walkers are of two types : _ informed _ particles that move ballistically towards a given target , and diffusing _ uninformed _ particles that are biased towards close informed individuals . </S>",
    "<S> this model mimics the dynamics of hierarchical groups of animals , where an informed individual tries to persuade and lead the movement of its conspecifics . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the success of this persuasion by the first - passage probability of the uninformed particle to the target , and we interpret the speed of the informed particle as a strategic parameter that the particle can tune to maximize its success . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the success probability is non - monotonic , reaching its maximum at an intermediate speed whose value increases with the diffusing rate of the uninformed particle . </S>",
    "<S> when two different groups of informed leaders traveling in opposite directions compete , usually the largest group is the most successful . </S>",
    "<S> however , the minority can reverse this situation and become the most probable winner by following two different strategies : increasing its attraction strength or adjusting its speed to an optimal value relative to the majority s speed . </S>"
