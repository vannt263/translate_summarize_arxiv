    "consider a sample @xmath0 from a @xmath1-dimensional multivariate distribution with covariance matrix @xmath2 . an important problem in multivariate analysis is to test the sphericity , namely the hypothesis @xmath3 where @xmath4 is _",
    "unspecified_. if the observations represent a multivariate error with @xmath1 components , the null hypothesis expresses the fact that the error is cross - sectionally uncorrelated ( independent if in addition they are normal ) and have a same variance ( homoscedasticity ) .",
    "much of the existing theory about this test has been exposed first in details in @xcite about gaussian likelihood ratio test and later in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also in textbooks like ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) . assume for a moment that the sample has a normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the sample covariance matrix and denote its eigenvalues by @xmath6 .",
    "two well established procedures for testing the sphericity are the likelihood ratio test ( _ lrt _ ) and a test devised in @xcite .",
    "the likelihood ratio statistic is , see e.g. @xcite , @xmath7 which is a power of the ratio of the geometric mean of the sample eigenvalues to the arithmetic mean",
    ". it is here noticed that in this formula it is necessary to assume that @xmath8 to avoid null eigenvalues in ( the numerator of ) @xmath9 .",
    "if we let @xmath10 while keeping @xmath1 fixed , classical asymptotic theory indicates that under the null hypothesis , @xmath11 , a chi - square distribution with degree of freedom @xmath12 .",
    "this asymptotic distribution is further refined by the following box - bartlett correction ( referred as _ bblrt _ ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15    by observing that the asymptotic variance of @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 , @xcite proposed to use the statistic @xmath18 for testing sphericity .",
    "when @xmath1 is fixed and @xmath10 , under the null hypothesis , it also holds that @xmath19 , which we referred to as _",
    "john s test .",
    "_ it is observed that @xmath20 is proportional to the square of the coefficient of variation of the sample eigenvalues , namely @xmath21 following the idea of the box - bartlett correction , @xcite established an expansion for the distribution function of the statistics @xmath20 ( referred as _ nagao s test _ ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23    it has been well known that classical multivariate procedures are in general challenged by large - dimensional data . a small simulation experiment is conducted to explore the performance of the bblrt and nagao s test ( two corrections ) with growing dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the sample size is set to @xmath24 while dimension @xmath1 increases from 4 to 60 ( we have also run other experiments with larger sample sizes @xmath25 but conclusions are very similar ) , and the nominal level is set to be @xmath26 .",
    "the samples come from normal vectors with mean zero and identity covariance matrix , and each pair of @xmath27 is assessed with 10000 independent replications .",
    "table [ tradsize ] gives the empirical sizes of bblrt and nagao s test .",
    "it is found here that when the dimension to sample size ratio @xmath28 is below @xmath29 , both tests have an empirical size close to the nominal test level @xmath30 .",
    "then when the ratio grows up , the bblrt becomes quickly biased while nagao s test still has a correct empirical size .",
    "it is striking that although nagao s test is derived under classical `` @xmath1 fixed , @xmath31 '' regime , it is remarkably robust against dimension inflation .",
    ".[tradsize ] empirical sizes of bblrt and nagao s test at @xmath32 significance level based on @xmath33 independent replications using normal vectors @xmath34 for @xmath24 and different values of @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when we evaluate the power , the same two alternatives power 1 and power 2 as above are considered .",
    "the sample size is fixed to @xmath24 and the ratio @xmath28 varies from 1 to 20 .",
    "we see that power 1 are much higher than power 2 for the same reason that the first alternative is easier to be distinguished from @xmath35 . besides , the powers under both alternatives all increase monotonically for @xmath36 .",
    "however , when @xmath28 is getting larger , say @xmath37 , we can observe that its size is a little larger and powers a little drop ( compared with @xmath38 ) but overall , it still behaves well , which can be considered as free from the assumption constraint `` @xmath39 '' . besides , the powers of cj are always slightly higher than those of c in this `` large @xmath1 small @xmath25 '' setting .",
    "since the asymptotic distribution for the clrt and cj are both derived under the `` marcenko - pasture scheme '' ( i.e @xmath40 ) , if @xmath28 is getting too large ( @xmath41 ) , it seems that the limiting results provided in this paper will loose accuracy .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xcite has extended the lw test to such a scheme ( @xmath41 ) for multivariate normal distribution .    summarizing all these findings from this monte - carlo study ,",
    "the overall figure is the following : when the ratio @xmath28 is much lower than 1 ( say smaller than 1/2 ) , it is preferable to employ clrt ( than cj , lw or c ) ; while this ratio is higher , cj ( or lw for normal data ) becomes more powerful ( slightly more powerful than c ) .",
    "in this section , we give an analysis of the powers of the two corrections : clrt and cj . to this end",
    ", we consider an alternative model that has attracted lots of attention since its introduction by @xcite , namely , the spiked population model .",
    "this model can be described as follows : the eigenvalues of @xmath2 are all one except for a few fixed number of them .",
    "thus , we restrict our sphericity testing problem to the following : @xmath42 where the multiplicity numbers @xmath43 s are fixed and satisfying @xmath44 . we derive the explicit expressions of the power functions of clrt and cj in this section .",
    "under @xmath45 , the empirical spectral distribution of @xmath2 is @xmath46 and it will converge to @xmath47 , a dirac mass at 1 , which is the same as the limit under the null hypothesis @xmath48 . from this point of view , anything related to the limiting spectral distribution remains the same whenever under @xmath35 or @xmath45 .",
    "then recall the clt for lss of the sample covariance matrix , as provided in @xcite , is of the form : @xmath49 where the right side of this equation is determined only by the limiting spectral distribution .",
    "so we can conclude that the limiting parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 remain the same under @xmath35 and @xmath45 , only the centering term @xmath52 possibly makes a difference . since there s a @xmath1 in front of @xmath53 , which tends to infinity as assumed , so knowing the convergence @xmath54 is not enough and more details about the convergence are needed . in @xcite",
    ", we have established an asymptotic expansion for the centering parameter when the population has a spiked structure .",
    "we will use these formulas like equations , and in the following to derive the powers of the clrt and cj .",
    "lemma [ lem : joint ] remains the same under @xmath45 , except that this time the centering terms become ( see formulas ( 4.11 ) and ( 4.12 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath55 repeating the proof of theorem [ clt ] , we can get : @xmath56 under @xmath45 . as a result",
    ", the power of clrt for testing @xmath35 against @xmath45 can be expressed as : @xmath57 for a pre - given significance level @xmath58 .",
    "it is worth noticing here that if the alternative has only one simple spike , i.e. @xmath59 , and assuming the real gaussian variable case , i.e. @xmath60 , reduces to a result provided in @xcite .",
    "however , our formula is valid for a general number of spikes with eventual multiplicities .",
    "besides , these authors use some more sophisticated tools of asymptotic contiguity and le cam s first and third lemmas , which are totally different from ours .    in order to calculate the power function of cj , we restated lemma [ cnlemma : joint ] as follows : @xmath61 where",
    "@xmath62 using the delta method as in the proof of theorem [ cnclt ] , this time , we have @xmath63 under @xmath45 .",
    "power function of cj can be expressed as @xmath64 for a pre - given significance level @xmath58 .",
    "now consider the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 appearing in the expressions and , they will achieve their minimum value @xmath67 at @xmath68 , which is to say , once @xmath69 s going away from 1 , the powers @xmath70 and @xmath71 will both increase .",
    "this phenomenon agrees with our intuition , since the more @xmath69 s deviate away from 1 , the easier to distinguish @xmath35 from @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the powers should naturally grow higher .    ) and cj ( @xmath71 ) under the spiked population alternative.,width=283 ]    then , we consider the power functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 as functions of @xmath72 , and see how they are going along with @xmath73 changing .",
    "we see that in expression , @xmath74 is increasing when @xmath75 , so @xmath70 is decreasing as the function of @xmath72 , which attains its maximum value @xmath76 when @xmath77 and minimum value @xmath58 when @xmath78 . also , expression is obviously a decreasing function of @xmath72 , attaining its maximum value @xmath76 when @xmath77 and minimum value @xmath58 when @xmath79 .",
    "we present the trends of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( corresponding to the power of clrt and cj ) in figure [ beta ] when only one spike @xmath80 exists .",
    "it is however a little different from the non - spiked case as showed in the simulation in section [ sec : simul ] ( both figure [ normal128 ] and figure [ gamma128 ] ) , where the power of clrt first increases then decreases while the power of cj is always increasing along with the increase of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "these power drops are due to the fact that when @xmath1 increases , since only one spike eigenvalue is considered , it becomes harder to distinguish both hypotheses .",
    "besides , an interesting finding here is that these power functions give a new confirmation of the fact that clrt behaves quite badly when @xmath81 , while cj test has a reasonable power for a significant range of @xmath82 .",
    "so far , we have assumed the observation @xmath83 are centered .",
    "however , this is hardly true in practical situations when @xmath84 is usually unknown .",
    "therefore , the sample covariance matrix should be taken as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the sample mean .",
    "because @xmath87 is a rank one matrix , substituting @xmath88 for @xmath89 when @xmath50 is unknown will not affect the limiting distribution in the clt for lss ; while it is not the case for the centering parameter , for it has a @xmath1 in front .",
    "recently , @xcite shows that if we use @xmath89 in the clt for lss when @xmath50 is unknown , the limiting variance remains the same as we use @xmath88 ; while the limiting mean has a shift which can be expressed as a complex contour integral .",
    "later , @xcite looks into this shift and finally derives a concise conclusion on the clt corresponding to @xmath89 : the random vector @xmath90 converges weakly to a gaussian vector with the same mean and covariance function as given in theorem [ t1 ] , where this time , @xmath91 .",
    "it is here important to pay attention that the only difference is in the centering term , where we use the new ratio @xmath92 instead of the previous @xmath93 , while leaving all the other terms unchanged .    using this result",
    ", we can modify our theorems [ clt ] and [ cnclt ] to get the clt of clrt and cj under @xmath35 when @xmath50 is unknown only by considering the eigenvalues of @xmath89 and substituting @xmath94 for @xmath25 in the centering terms .",
    "more precisely , now equations and in theorems [ clt ] and [ cnclt ] become @xmath95 and @xmath96    the same procedures can be applied to get the clt of clrt and cj under @xmath45 when @xmath50 is unknown .",
    "this time , equations and become @xmath97 and @xmath98 and therefore the powers of clrt and cj under the spiked alternative remain unchanged as expressed in and .    .",
