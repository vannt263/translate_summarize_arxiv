    "three - body systems are ubiquitous in astrophysics , appearing in a wide range of configurations and scales , from planet - satellite systems to black holes in dense stellar clusters .",
    "although the gravitational three - body problem is in general non - integrable , a hierarchical system ( i.e. , triple configuration consisting of an inner binary orbited by a distant companion ) can be simplified by retaining the lowest orders in the multipole expansion of the interaction potentials . in this case , the triple system is represented by two nested binary systems ( an  inner binary \" and an  outer binary \" ) , with the corresponding orbital elements evolving on secular timescales due to mutual interactions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discovered that when the mutual inclination angle between the inner and outer binaries is sufficiently high , the time - averaged tidal gravitational force from the outer companion can induce large - amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary . in recent years , numerous works have shown that lidov ",

    "the simplest lidov  kozai mechanism involves a test mass ( `` planet '' ) orbiting a primary body ( `` star '' ) perturbed by an external companion , with the interaction potential truncated to the quadrupole order . in this test - mass , quadrupole approximation , the projected angular momentum ( along the external binary axis ) of the planet",

    "kozai oscillation is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the initial inclination angle of the two orbits .",

    "it has been recognized that the lidov ",
    "kozai cycles can be suppressed by other short - range effects that induce periapse precession of the inner binary , including the precessions due to general relativity ( gr ) , rotational bulge and tidal distortion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the suppression arises because these additional precessions tend to destroy the near @xmath7 resonance between the longitude of the periapse @xmath8 and the longitude of the ascending node @xmath9 required for eccentricity excitation .",
    "thus , the maximum eccentricity can be reduced from the `` pure '' lidov  kozai value ( equation [ eq : emax ] ) .",
    "it has also been recognized that high - order expansion of the interaction potential can lead to a much richer dynamical behaviour of hierarchical triples than the simplest lidov ",

    "@xcite have derived the orbit - averaged hamiltonian to octupole order and used the resulting equation of motion to explore some aspects of the evolution of triples . unlike the pure quadrupole case",
    ", the projected angular momentum of the inner binary ( even in the test - mass limit ) is no longer constant when the octupole potential is included ( the octupole potential is nonzero when the outer binary is eccentric and the components of the inner binary have different masses ) .",
    "therefore , the secular dynamics of triples is generally not integrable in the octupole order and may lead to chaos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "kozai mechanism : ( i ) the eccentricity of the inner binary can be driven to extreme value ( @xmath10 ) even for `` modest '' initial orbital inclinations ; ( ii ) the inner orbit can flip and come retrograde relative to the outer orbit .",
    "these two effects are related , as orbital flip is often associated with extreme eccentricity . since the precession of periapse due to short - range forces is strongly dependent on eccentricity , it is not clear to what extent the extreme eccentricity can be realized in realistic situations . while short - range effects were included in some population synthesis calculations for the formation of hot jupiters ( e.g. , *",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we derive the secular equations of motion up to the octupole order using a vectorial formalism .",
    "in section  3 , we provide a brief overview of short - range effects , estimating the maximum eccentricity allowed by the presence of various srfs . in section  4 , we describe our numerical integrations , carried out over a range of parameters for triple systems consisting of a star - planet binary and an outer stellar companion . in section  5 , we extend our analysis to triple systems in which all components have comparable masses .",

    "the horizontal line in figure [ fig : case1c ] corresponds to the limiting eccentricity given by equation  ( [ eq : ftt ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that this limiting eccentricity applies even in the general case of comparable masses .",
    "also note that the tides are mainly responsible for the eccentricity suppression ( see table 4 ) .",
    "it is not surprising that the analytic estimate of @xmath563 , derived in the test - mass limit ( section  [ sec : max_ecc ] ) , remains a good approximation for comparable - mass systems . for @xmath48 very close to unity",
    ", the vast majority of the angular momentum resides in the outer binary , forcing the inner binary to behave essentially as a test particle . note that we can use equations  ( [ eq : j1vec ] ) ,  ( [ eq : j2vec ] ) and  ( [ eq : e2vec ] ) at the quadrupole level ( @xmath113 ) to write @xmath564 where all the vectors involved are of norm unity .",
    "then we find that @xmath565 is very small provided that @xmath566 .",
    "therefore , for the high eccentricity phase of lidov  kozai cycles , the analysis of section  [ sec : max_ecc ] for test particles still applies in the comparable - mass regime . as in the test - mass cases ( section  [ sec : paramspace ] )",
    ", the octupole effect expands the range of the initial mutual inclinations capable of reaching maximal eccentricities .      as for the eccentricity curves ,",
    "the inclination curves at the quadrupole level in figure  [ fig : case1c ] ( black curves ) are symmetric respect to @xmath488 . in this particular example",
    ", srfs do not inflict significant modifications except for the close vicinity of @xmath488 , which sees the amplitude in the inclination oscillations ( the difference between @xmath567 and @xmath568 ) reduced ( green curves ) .    at the octupole level ( red curves ) , the asymmetries that arise in the eccentricity curve find their counterpart in the inclination curves . within a narrow range of angles ( rightward of @xmath488 ) ,",
    "the orbits are allowed to flip from retrograde to prograde . for initial inclinations",
    "bellow @xmath569 , although the octupole potential introduces significant changes in @xmath570 and @xmath571 , it is not strong enough to cause orbital flips . in accordance to what is observed in the eccentricity curves ,",
    "the octupole contributions to the left of @xmath488 are not affected by srf , however , the flips observed for angles @xmath572 is nearly entirely suppressed by the inclusion of these additional effects ( blue curves ) .",
    "the example of figure  [ fig : case1c ] shows moderate differences in maximum eccentricity and inclination range between the quadrupole and the octupole - level solutions . to explore the behaviour of these variables for larger octupole contributions",
    "we integrate systems with @xmath574 varying the magnitude of @xmath272 ( table  [ tab : paramspace_general ] ) .",
    "some of these examples are shown in figure  [ fig : case2c ] and [ fig : case2e ] .",
    "the most important difference between the top panels of figure  [ fig : case2c ] and figure  [ fig : case1c ] is the width of the maximal eccentricity region to the right of @xmath488 ( this was already observed in the examples of section  [ sec : paramspace ] ) and the deepening of the high eccentricity region to the left of @xmath488 . as @xmath194 is increased , the asymmetries between the prograde and retrograde regions of the figure become more pronounced .",
    "prograde orbits at intermediate inclination see their maximum eccentricities increase , to a point that they become comparable to those seen for the retrograde orbits .",
    "it is at this point ( when @xmath575 ) that prograde orbits are allowed to flip orientations .",
    "when srfs are considered , the maximum eccentricities ( green and blue curves ) are altered in a similar fashion as the example of figure [ fig : case1c ] .",
    "the value of @xmath238 of equation  ( [ eq : ftt ] ) is still in agreement with the global maximum of @xmath237 ( see table 4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth of @xmath576 is suppressed ( no flip ) in prograde configurations , while @xmath577 appears to vary erratically when @xmath572 ( see figure [ fig : case2c ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : case1e ] and [ fig : case2e ] show examples of increased @xmath272 for the same @xmath194 as in figures  [ fig : case1c ] and [ fig : case2c ] . in these cases",
    ", @xmath563 is smaller than in case 2c ( figure  [ fig : case2c ] ) , which implies that srfs are truncating @xmath237 not only in the vicinity of @xmath489 , but also in the lower inclination region [ @xmath578 , thus affecting the octupole - level effects significantly . despite the significant restrictions on @xmath237 imposed by srfs",
    ", the octupole effects can not be neglected for their values of @xmath194 , since they allow for these systems to reach eccentricities with @xmath579 for initial mutual inclinations as low as @xmath580 ( figure  [ fig : case2e ] ) while the quadrupole - level calculation would require inclinations beyond @xmath581 to reach similar values .",
    "in this paper , we have computed the extent to which energy - conserving short - range effects alter the orbital evolution of planets and stars in hierarchical triple systems undergoing lidov - kozai oscillations . in particular , we have systematically examined how general relativistic precession , tides and oblateness can moderate the extreme values in eccentricity and inclination that can be achieved owing to the octupole terms in the interaction potential .    by carrying of a sequence of numerical experiments",
    ", we have measured the extrema in eccentricity and inclination for a variety of hierarchical triples , systematically varying the relative strengths of the octupole terms and of the short - range effects in terms of their contributions to the potential energy .",
    "the results of our calculations can be summarized into four main findings .",
    "\\(1 ) the importance of the octupole effects depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath57 ( see equation [ eq : c ] ) , which measures the relative strength between the octupole and quadrupole potentials .",
    "the main contribution of the octupole terms to eccentricity and inclination excitation is limited to a range in initial inclinations or  window of influence \" , the width of which grows with @xmath57 . as @xmath57 decreases , the window of influence becomes increasingly confined to mutual inclinations close to @xmath122 .",
    "for example , at @xmath582 , the octupole terms are important only within a few degrees around @xmath583 ( see tables 1 and 2 ; also see fig .",
    "[ fig : case5 ] ) .",
    "\\(2 ) we find that short range forces can indeed compete with the octupole - level terms in the potential , and that these additional effects impose a strict upper limit on the maximum achievable eccentricity .",
    "most importantly , we find that to a very good approximation , this maximum eccentricity can be derived analytically using the quadrupole approximation in the test - particle limit ( see section 3.3 and equation [ eq : ftt ] ) .",
    "this analytic limiting eccentricity holds even for a strong octupole contribution as well as in the general case of three comparable masses .",
    "\\(3 ) our results indicate that , despite the upper limit in eccentricity ( which is independent on the octupole strength ) , the width of the window of influence of the octupole potential ( see point 1 above ) is largely unaffected by the srfs .",
    "\\(4 ) we find that orbital flips are affected by the srfs . with increasing strength of the srfs ( characterized by the dimensionless parameters ; see equations [ eq : r11 ] , [ eq : r12 ] and [ eq : r13 ] ) , orbital flips are increasingly confined to the region close to @xmath584 ( see figs .",
