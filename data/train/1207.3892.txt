    "the statistical properties of the gaussian field @xmath5 are entirely encoded by the function @xmath7 , or equivalently , its moments @xmath11 .",
    "the most basic difference between gaussian and non - gaussian variables is that gaussian ones are always symmetric about their mean . as a consequence , irrespective of its power spectrum",
    ", a gaussian field has equal densities of maxima and minima .",
    "hence , a nonvanishing imbalance @xmath12 between these two types of extrema serves as a probe to detect and quantify the non - gaussian component of a signal , provided that it can be measured directly .    for example , consider the primordial curvature perturbation field , @xmath13 , a nearly gaussian field of central interest to modern cosmological studies @xcite . within a _ local _ approximation",
    ", the primordial field is obtained from a gaussian field @xmath14 via a nonlinear relation @xmath15 . determining the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 is one of the central tasks in the study of cosmological non - gaussianities .",
    "as we shall see , the quadratic coefficient can be determined from the imbalance @xmath12 between maxima and minima of @xmath13 .",
    "the imbalance can be derived in the more general context of a non - gaussian field @xmath18 that is obtained from a gaussian field @xmath3 via any nonlinear deformation @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 is a monotonic function , the maxima and minima do not change  only a nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath20 can alter this balance .",
    "the critical points of @xmath18 are given by @xmath21 , where the dash indicates the derivative of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "this condition shows that @xmath18 and @xmath3 have the same critical points .",
    "note however that , if @xmath22 at a critical point @xmath23 , then a maximum ( minimum ) at @xmath24 will be turned into a minimum ( maximum ) at @xmath25 .",
    "the number of saddle points does not change because of topological constraints ( it is equal to the invariant sum of maxima and minima ) .",
    "if the transformation has a bias towards converting minima into maxima , then @xmath18 will have more maxima than minima ; for example , @xmath26 reverses its slope at sufficiently negative values of @xmath3 , which are most likely to be minima .",
    "following this logic , the first step toward calculating the imbalance between maxima and minima is to determine the probability @xmath27 that @xmath28 for a minimum @xmath29 of @xmath3 .",
    "the symmetry properties of @xmath3 imply that the analogous probability distribution for maxima is @xmath30 .",
    "the fraction of minima of @xmath3 that become maxima of @xmath18 is obtained by integrating @xmath27 over the range of @xmath31 for which @xmath32 .",
    "likewise , the fraction of maxima of @xmath3 that are turned into minima is given by the integral of @xmath30 over the same range .",
    "the overall imbalance in the densities of the maxima and minima of @xmath18 can be readily obtained by adding these opposite contributions .",
    "the result reads    @xmath33    for two dimensions , the exact analytical expression for @xmath27 is explicitly derived in appendix a ",
    "it depends only on the moments @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "rescaling @xmath37 does not affect the function @xmath27 , since it increases the density of maxima with any value of @xmath3 by the same proportion .",
    "hence , only @xmath38 ( which sets the scale of the distribution ) and the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 can enter in the expression for @xmath27 ( see plot in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_maxmin ] ) .     between the densities of maxima and minima of @xmath40 , where @xmath3 is a gaussian field with @xmath41 , as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the data points are results from computer - generated fields , the solid curve is the theoretical result ( eq .  ) .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding distribution of minima @xmath27 ( which forms the basis of our theoretical result ) , both the theoretical curve and a histogram of data gathered from computer - generated fields . ]    as an illustration , apply eq .   to the perturbed gaussian field @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ fig_maxmin ] shows our theoretical formula as a continuous line , validated by numerical data ( dots ) obtained from computer - generated random surfaces with amplitude spectrum @xmath43 , having @xmath44 .",
    "the imbalance between maxima and minima is particularly useful to track large deviations from gaussianity .",
    "this can be seen explicitly for the quadratic perturbation considered above .",
    "note that , since @xmath3 itself has an equal number of maxima and minima , the imbalance @xmath12 in @xmath18 is only created when one of these critical points is inverted . whether @xmath3 has a high likelihood of having a negative @xmath45 is controlled by @xmath46 .",
    "the probability of @xmath47 exceeding @xmath48 is exponentially small .",
    "thus , @xmath12 rises roughly as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "note that our approach in deriving eq .",
    "and @xmath27 is nonperturbative and hence capable of describing large deviations from gaussianity ( for the specific type of deviation considered here ) , as demonstrated by the agreement between our formula and numerics over the entire @xmath42-range probed in fig .",

    "the near - gaussian fields under investigation are not always directly accessible experimentally .",
    "for example , the mass distribution along the line of sight responsible for weak gravitational lensing is mostly composed of dark matter and hence it can not be detected directly @xcite . if the projected gravitational potential over a flat patch of the sky is taken to be the height of a 2d surface @xcite , the _ measurable _ shear field , is given by the lines of principal curvature @xcite , as shown in fig .  [ fig_umbilics ] . at some special points called umbilics ,",
    "the curvature is equal in all directions , so the shear field can not be defined and it must vanish . more precisely , a point @xmath51 on a surface with height function @xmath52 is an umbilic if the second derivatives satisfy the two conditions @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the ratio between different types of umbilical points ( which is a universal number for an isotropic gaussian field ) serves as an indicator of non - gaussianities in lieu of the extrema which can not be detected .",
    "a similar reasoning can be applied to study polarization singularities in the cosmic microwave background @xcite and topological defects in a nematic or superfluid near criticality @xcite .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig_umbilics ] reveals that there are three types of umbilics : lemons , monstars and stars .",
    "note that these umbilics are topological defects in the curvature - line field .",
    "the topological index of any umbilic is equal to plus ( minus ) @xmath55 , if the curvature - line field rotates clockwise ( counter - clockwise ) by an angle @xmath56 , along any closed path encircling that umbilic only in the clockwise direction .",
    "a star has three curvature lines terminating at it and a topological index of @xmath57 .",
    "a lemon has only one line and index @xmath58 .",
    "a monstar has index @xmath58 , like a lemon , but three lines terminating at it , like a star .",
    "a striking feature of isotropic gaussian fields is that the monstar fraction , the relative density of monstars with respect to all umbilics , equals @xmath59 ; this is a universal number independent of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "any deviation from this special value is therefore a sure sign of non - gaussian effects .",
    "we will again consider a height field that is a nonlinear function of a gaussian , @xmath60 . in this general case , we were not able to find an exact result as we were for the extrema .",
    "we shall therefore assume that the nonlinear contribution is small , such that @xmath61 , with @xmath62 a nonlinear perturbation and @xmath63 a small parameter controlling the size of the nonlinearity .",
    "we can express @xmath64 in terms of the joint probability distribution @xmath65 of the second and third derivatives of @xmath18 . to calculate @xmath65",
    ", we use the property that a probability distribution is determined by its moments of all orders ( if the distribution is well - behaved ) .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by calculating the generating function of the distribution , @xmath66  its logarithm can be directly expressed in terms of the _ cumulants _ @xmath67    @xmath68    where @xmath69 are the stochastic variables given by the spatial derivatives of @xmath18",
    ". the probability distribution can then be obtained from the generating function by taking the inverse fourier transform with respect to @xmath70 .",
    "the cumulants can be written in terms of expectation values , e.g.  @xmath71 . in this context , these expectation values are called _ moments _ , which are not to be confused with the moments @xmath72 defined before .    for gaussian variables ,",
    "only the second - order cumulants are nonzero .",
    "this gives rise to a generating function of the form @xmath73 one can easily check that the inverse fourier transform of @xmath66 in eq .   precisely yields the probability distribution for a set of correlated gaussian variables ( assuming @xmath74 ) , see eq .  .",
    "more generally , by determining all the cumulants , one can construct the generating function and from that the probability distribution .",
    "we shall derive the monstar fraction up to first order in the perturbation @xmath75 only ; consistently we need to determine all the cumulants up to first order only .",
    "the monstar fraction ( even at order @xmath42 ) could in principle depend on @xmath62 in a complicated way , if @xmath62 is an arbitrary nonlinear function .",
    "in fact , quadratic terms in the function @xmath62 produce degree @xmath76 cumulants in the distribution function of the field @xmath18 ( i.e. , skewness ) , cubic terms produce kurtosis ( degree @xmath77 cumulants ) and in general degree @xmath78 terms in @xmath62 produce degree @xmath79 cumulants .",
    "however , the monstar fraction can be determined from just the distribution of a few derivatives of @xmath18 , whose cumulants vanish beyond the fourth order due to symmetry , as shown in the supporting information .",
    "consequently , the final result for the monstar fraction depends only on a single parameter , @xmath80 , where the primes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath3 .     of @xmath81 , where @xmath3 is a gaussian field with @xmath82 , as a function of @xmath42 .",

    "all _ of @xmath103 gives the total density of umbilical points , while the density of monstars is obtained by integrating over a specific range , which can be found in appendix b. the monstar fraction is then the ratio of these two densities .",

    "this simple class of models may describe the local evolution of a system that starts out with a gaussian distribution , as for instance the growth of a population of cells that are initially distributed on a dish and then divide without any significant migration from one region to another .    however , many dynamical systems evolve in a nonlocal , nonlinear way .",
    "non - gaussianities are generated dynamically from the nonlinear equations of motion that the field @xmath116 obeys , even if the initial condition @xmath117 is gaussian . unlike the case of local evolution , the imbalance between maxima and minima will now exhibit a power law increase , as the nonlinear perturbation grows .",
    "a broad class of nonlinear diffusion equations describes the necessary mixing between regions .",
    "examples include several models of structure formation in both condensed matter @xcite and cosmology @xcite , the cahn - hilliard equation for the development of order after a phase transition @xcite and simplified models of surface growth @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the last of these , the deterministic kpz equation @xcite which models the height evolution of a substrate as atoms accumulate on it :    @xmath118    this equation is arrived at in the following way : to first order , the surface simply grows at a constant rate .",
    "this constant rate does not appear in the equation , however , since it is simply subtracted out ; the two terms on the right - hand side are the additional effects .",
    "the first term describes the diffusion of particles along the surface , and the second nonlinear term describes approximately how the growth - rate varies with the local slope . the surface is assumed to grow at a constant rate perpendicular to itself , but since the height is measured vertically , @xmath119 depends on the slope : this gives rise to the term quadratic in @xmath120 .",
    "our approach can be applied to other nonlinear diffusion problems well beyond surface - growth dynamics , when a different choice for the quadratic term is made .",

    "after long times , this expression decays back to zero .",
    "the reason for the decay is that , at long times , @xmath144 involves an average over a larger and larger window , so by the central limit theorem , it starts to acquire gaussian statistics characterized by a vanishingly small imbalance between maxima and minima .    for early times",

    "the agreement for the entire range of times is special for the kpz equation : for more general equations , the agreement would break down at sufficiently late times , since the nonlinearities eventually grow exponentially ; the exact transformation of the kpz equation to a linear equation implies that the nonlinearities remain bounded .",

    "<S> gaussian random fields pervade all areas of science . however , it is often the departures from gaussianity that carry the crucial signature of the nonlinear mechanisms at the heart of diverse phenomena , ranging from structure formation in condensed matter and cosmology to biomedical imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the standard test of non - gaussianity is to measure higher order correlation functions . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we take a different route . </S>",
    "<S> we show how geometric and topological properties of gaussian fields , such as the statistics of extrema , are modified by the presence of a non - gaussian perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting discrepancies give an independent way to detect and quantify non - gaussianities . in our treatment , we consider both local and nonlocal mechanisms that generate non - gaussian fields , both statically and dynamically through nonlinear diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> random fields pervade all areas of science . </S>",
    "<S> a disparate class of phenomena , ranging from the cosmic background radiation @xcite and surface roughness @xcite to medical images of brain activity @xcite and optical speckle patterns @xcite , produce data that can be regarded as random fields . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of geometrical features of these fields , such as the density of extrema of various types , can be used to characterize them @xcite . when the fields can be approximated as gaussian fields , </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of these statistical properties is generally well understood @xcite : the statistics of extrema reflects the amount of field fluctuations at short distances .    </S>",
    "<S> though analytical investigations are often restricted to gaussian fields , phenomena described by nonlinear laws ( such as the dynamics of inflation that produced the cosmic background radiation ) produce non - gaussian signals . </S>",
    "<S> quite often , the observable signal is averaged over a large scale , producing approximately gaussian statistics on account of the central limit theorem , and masking the nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the surviving tiny departures from gaussianity can carry the crucial signature of the nonlinear microscopic mechanisms at the heart of the phenomena . as an illustration , </S>",
    "<S> consider a low resolution measurement of the spatial magnetization of a material well above the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization fluctuates like a gaussian random variable  </S>",
    "<S> each region contains many domains oriented up or down in arbitrary proportion . </S>",
    "<S> however , a small non - gaussian contribution remains , because there is a maximum possible magnetization per unit area which can be traced all the way down to the quantization of the spin of the electrons and hence the probability distribution can not exhibit gaussian tails .    in order to unveil such elusive effects </S>",
    "<S> , one needs an indicator that is sensitive to both _ short distances _ and _ small signals_.    the most common tool used to probe the statistics of a random field is to measure its correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the statistical properties of a random scalar field , @xmath0 , with gaussian statistics , are entirely determined by its two - point correlation function @xmath1 , and its higher - order correlation functions can be written simply as the sum of products of two - point correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the nonfactorizability of these higher - order correlation functions is one of the standard indicators of non - gaussian statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on a more geometric approach : view the scalar field as the height of a surface and study its random topography to infer the statistical properties of the signal ( see inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_umbilics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the densities of peaks and valleys , or of topological defects in the curvature lines known as umbilics ( see fig .  [ fig_umbilics ] ) , are sensitive indicators of how jagged the height field is at _ short distances_. as we shall see , they provide an independent pipeline to detect non - gaussianities , distinct from multiple - point correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> this geometric approach has been applied successfully to track the power spectrum of a gaussian field and it has been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce the key physical concepts and mathematical techniques necessary to study the stochastic geometry of signals that can be described as a gaussian random field plus a perturbation that we wish to track . </S>",
    "<S> we first show how to treat non - gaussianities within a _ local _ approximation and calculate how the statistics of extrema change when a nonlinear transformation @xmath2 is applied locally to a gaussian field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> then we consider the case of fields that can not be probed directly , by calculating the statistics of _ umbilical points _ , which are topological defects of the lines of principal curvature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we turn to the class of nonlinear diffusion equations @xcite and go beyond the local approximation , by considering the effects of spatial gradients that couple values of the field at different locations . as an illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we solve explicitly for the nonlocal non - gaussianities generated dynamically by the deterministic kpz equation which models surface growth @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> for a star , @xmath4 for the other two . </S>",
    "<S> the lemon has one ( locally ) straight curvature line terminating at it ( indicated with a thick line ) , the other two have three . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows a computer - generated gaussian surface with periodic boundary conditions , a small square of which served as the source of this picture . ] </S>"
