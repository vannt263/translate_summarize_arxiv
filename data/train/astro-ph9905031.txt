    "in the last two decades it has become clear that collisions and mergers of galaxies are important processes that trigger spectacular starburst and nuclear activity , and that play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. sanders and mirabel 1996 , genzel , lutz and tacconi 1998 ) .",

    "we detect a total of 1220 jy @xmath3 of co flux from ngc  6240 .",

    "such a distribution was strongly suggested in the lower resolution co map of bryant and scoville ( 1999 ) .",
    "the aspect ratio of the integrated co distribution in figure 1 is 1:2 ( ew : ns ) , slightly larger than the aspect ratio expected from the inclination of the large scale disk ( 1:3 for i@xmath59 , fried and schulz 1983 ) .",
    "the two nuclei are located approximately at either end of this central gas disk .",
    "this is best seen in figure 6 ( middle ) which compares the 5 ghz merlin map with the integrated co emission shown on a linear intensity scale .",
    "the centroid of the integrated co emission is somewhat closer to ( @xmath60 nne of ) the brighter , southern nucleus .    only the two main nuclei are detected by the merlin observations ( figure 6b ) ; the extended radio structure in the vla maps of colbert et al .",
    "( 1994 ; figure 6a ) is mostly resolved below the sensitivity of the merlin images .",
    "the extended radio structure surrounding the southern nucleus matches well the sidelobe pattern of the aperture synthesis beam and is probably an artifact of the imaging and calibration process .",
    "there is no compact radio ( or infrared ) continuum source at or near the position of the co peak , neither on the @xmath61 resolution 8 ghz map of colbert et al . ,",
    "nor on the @xmath62 5 ghz merlin map .",
    "this and the fact that the total radio flux density from the two nuclei falls right on the radio - far - infrared correlation for star forming galaxies if one takes the total far - infrared flux from the iras data ( colbert et al .",
    "1994 ) strongly suggests _ that there is no strong luminosity source hidden at the center of the co emission_. however , there is a bridge of extended 8 ghz emission connecting the southern and northern nuclei and approximately following the general outline of the co emission .",
    "the orientation of the long axis of the co disk ( p.a.@xmath1410@xmath47 20@xmath47 , figure 1 ) is about the same as that of the large scale galactic disk of ngc  6240 but somewhat tipped away from the kinematic major axis as derived in this paper ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "there are several distinct gas features in the integrated and channel maps surrounding this central structure and extending to spatial scales of 3@xmath634@xmath64 .",
    "these features can be best identified in the channel maps ( see below ) .",
    "a second , smaller co peak ( 220 jy @xmath3 of the total flux of 1220 jy @xmath3 is located 4@xmath645@xmath63 nne of the co maximum .",
    "the second peak ( the ` northern clump ' ) was first seen in the 7@xmath64 co 1@xmath10 interferometry map of wang , scoville and sanders ( 1991 )",
    ". it does not correlate with any feature in the radio continuum , infrared or optical maps .",
    "the hcn 1@xmath10 emission is confined to the central @xmath23@xmath63 radius region of the co peak .",
    "we detect a total of 12 jy @xmath3 from this region .",
    "the profiles and widths of the hcn lines are very similar to those seen in co when the two data sets are smoothed to the @xmath50 resolution of the hcn map .",
    "this is an indication that the emission from both species arises from the same dense gas throughout the region of the co peak .",
    "since the co data are of much higher spatial resolution the rest of the paper is devoted to the co results alone .",
    "the neutral gas in ngc  6240 is highly disturbed , with unusually large velocity widths almost everywhere in the central 3@xmath64 .",

    "@xmath66 north of the peak even the @xmath67540 @xmath3 = 7340 @xmath3 ] range covered by our two lo settings was not sufficient to include all of the line emission ( figure 1 ) .",
    "in this region there are red wings extending to at least @xmath69 @xmath3 .",
    "a study of the spectra in figure 1 and the channel maps in figure 2 reveals that there are several distinct kinematic components .    in the central disk the centroids / peaks of the highly blueshifted emission ( @xmath70250 to @xmath71480 @xmath3 ) and of the highly redshifted emission ( 300550 @xmath3 )",
    "are separated by @xmath72 along p.a.=40@xmath49 ( figure 3 and figure 6 , bottom ) .",
    "the average position of the blue- and red - shifted emission centroids is coincident with the peak of the 2@xmath34 m vibrationally excited h@xmath31 emission ( tecza et al .",
    "1999 ) and is @xmath73 s of the co integrated flux peak . the most likely interpretation of this large velocity gradient is rotation of the central disk with a line of nodes along a p.a . of @xmath74",
    ". however , the line profiles in the central structure all are singly peaked , rather than the double - horned profiles characteristic of a rotating disk . to wipe out the classical double - horn there are probably two effects at work :",
    "( 1 ) the gas motions could have a very large random component and ( 2 ) , the rotation curve of the disk could be steeply rising from the center outwards .",
    "these effects could combine most effectively if most of the disk emission comes from the lower velocity central part of the disk .",
    "in addition , radiative transport effects in an optically thick disk may further decrease the contrast between the optically thicker , high velocity edges and the thinner lower velocity parts of the emission profile .",
    "we investigate possible models in more detail below .",
    "it is very unlikely that the velocity gradient is caused by a bipolar outflow .",
    "the molecular gas mass in the central disk significantly exceeds 10@xmath75 m@xmath19 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the outflow thus would be @xmath4010@xmath76 ergs .",
    "the dynamical lifetime of the present central co concentration would then be @xmath7710@xmath78 years and the mechanical energy deposition rate would be @xmath79 l@xmath19 @xmath80 0.05 l@xmath30 .",
    "this deposition rate exceeds the mechanical luminosity of the superwind by a factor of 3 or more .",
    "these energy and time scale considerations make an outflow scenario very improbable .",
    "in addition , it is then unclear where the origin of the outflow is , since there is no radio source at the center of the co peak . in this scenario",
    "it is not obvious why the two radio nuclei are located at either end of the disk .",
    "there are a number of separate gas features connecting the central 500 pc to the larger scale disk ( indicated as letters a through e on figure 1 ) .",
    "these features are also present in the 2@xmath29 m h@xmath81 maps of herbst et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , van der werf et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and tecza et al .",
    "the two most prominent of these ( a , b ) emanate from the southern edge of the disk and arch to the sw and se on either side of the southern nucleus ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "both features can be easily recognized on the integrated line maps as well as in the channel maps ( figures 1 and 2 ) , largely because they have very broad lines ( figure 1 ) . as in the central region",
    "the broad lines all along the lengths of these features are in fact their most prominent characteristic .",
    "systematic velocity gradients along the features are comparatively small .",
    "the gas in feature c leads from the center to the se and is mainly blueshifted ( @xmath71250 to 0 @xmath3 ) , with a possible connection to a lower velocity long filament stretching toward the ne .",
    "features d and e consist of redshifted gas ( 100 to 500 @xmath3 ) with very wide lines .",
    "they connect the northern edge of the central concentration to the nne and nnw , with a possible bridge to the northern clump at @xmath82 . taken together features a+b and d+e appear to form a ` butterfly ' pattern emanating from the nuclear concentration to the north and south , straddling around the two infrared / radio nuclei .",
    "ngc  6240 is highly unusual because of these large chaotic velocities .",
    "none of the several other ulirgs / mergers studied so far with high resolution mm- interferometry have these characteristics ( e.g. yun and scoville 1995 , bryant and scoville 1997 , scoville et al .",
    "1997 , downes and solomon 1998 , sakamoto et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it is difficult to interpret the kinematics and gas distribution as a simple , orbital motion or uniform flow .",
    "the most likely interpretation of the enormous line widths is that they largely represent line of sight projections in a complex , highly chaotic gas flow .",
    "this system has many streamers with a wide range of angular momenta and orbital parameters .",
    "in addition one would expect that the large velocity widths cause shocks and dissipation .",
    "dissipation of the cloud kinetic energy through shocks naturally explains the luminous infrared molecular hydrogen emission ; recall that ngc 6240 is the most luminous h@xmath31 line source currently known ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 , section 5.1 ) .",
    "the fact that these motions still exist in the central regions of ngc  6240 argues for this system being in a relatively early phase of merging before the chaotic motions have been dissipated .      in order to quantify the dynamical properties of the central co disk we fit the data by an axisymmetric turbulent , rotating disk ( see tacconi et al .",
    "1994 ) . recognizing that the gas distribution and kinematics are , in detail , more complicated than a simple axisymmetric model , the main disk parameters were tuned interactively to fit the principal characteristics of the data and to represent the axisymmetrically averaged gas properties .",
    "table 2 lists the parameters ( gas density distribution , rotation curve and local turbulent velocity dispersion ) of our best disk model .",

    "= 40@xmath47 ( the dynamical major axis of the central disk ) are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the observed and model line profiles are compared in figure 5 .",
    "the key ingredients of this model are a bright central gas concentration at radii of up to @xmath83 , a rising rotation curve to a maximum of @xmath84 at r@xmath85 ( for an assumed inclination of 70@xmath4975@xmath49 ) and a large turbulent velocity width of fwhm 300@xmath46 50 @xmath3 .",
    "the inferred model rotation curve as a function of radius is plotted in figure 7 .",
    "the average ratio of rotation velocity in the central disk to the one dimensional velocity dispersion ( @xmath86 fwhm ) is @xmath87 , with a range of 1 to 3 .",
    "this indicates that the central molecular disk is highly turbulent .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the disk is geometrically thick .",
    "these dynamics and the mass density ( see below ) are similar to those of stars in cores of elliptical galaxies ( bender et al .",
    "in fact the model requires a fwhm z - thickness of about @xmath88 ( 330 pc ) in order to match the profiles in the se and nw corners of the central concentration ( figure 5 ) .",
    "however , even with this large scale height the model profiles fit the data poorly s , sw and se of the peak .",
    "this probably indicates that separate kinematical systems , perhaps related to the streamers a through c that appear to merge here into the central disk , are present .",
    "it is impossible for any axisymmetric kinematic model to reproduce all of the complicated kinematic and spatial structures observed in a violent merger event such as that of ngc 6240 .",
    "the large local line widths and relatively small , large scale velocity gradients suggest that radiative transport effects through the disk may play a role .",
    "following downes and solomon ( 1998 ) we have computed models based on the disk code of dutrey , guilloteau and simon ( 1994 ) with parameters appropriate for ngc 6240 .",
    "the code , which was modified by downes and solomon , includes non - lte radiative transport effects to account for finite opacity .",
    "for the relatively small optical depths that best fit the co emission characteristics of ngc 6240 ( section 4 see below ) the kinematic parameters derived from the radiative transfer model are very similar to those listed in table 2 .",
    "since the gas dynamics are midway between a rotationally supported , cold rotating disk and a dispersionally supported , hot system it is appropriate to analyze the gas dynamics in terms of the observed velocity dispersion as well .",
    "figure 4 shows the second moment map , @xmath89,/ [ \\int i_{co}(v)dv]$ ] ] of the co 2@xmath351 emission .",
    "taking @xmath90 as a measure of the equivalent circular velocity , the rotation curve inferred from this map is in excellent agreement with the results of the rotating disk model in table 2 ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the dispersion increases from the co flux peak to a maximum of 210 @xmath3 ( equivalent circular velocity of 300 @xmath3 ) in an oval ring at projected radius @xmath91 and then decreases slowly at larger radii .",
    "_ we thus conclude from modeling the gas dynamics that there is a prominent concentration of mass centered on the co flux peak ( between the radio / infrared nuclei ) which is extended over about @xmath92_. in a separate paper ( tecza et al .",
    "1999 ) we show from sub - arcsecond resolution near - infrared field imaging spectroscopy that the stellar dynamics in the center of ngc  6240 also supports this conclusion .",
    "tecza et al .",
    "show that the stellar velocity dispersion peaks between the two nuclei , even after they account for the rotation of the stars in the individual nuclei .",
    "while the axisymmetric disk model provides a satisfactory overall fit to the large scale structures observed in the p - v diagram ( figure 4 ) , it deviates significantly from the data in the central , low velocity emission ( figure 5 ) .",
    "compared to the model , the observed line profile is asymmetric and the peak emission is blue - shifted by a few tens of @xmath3 with respect to the velocity centroid of the outer , high velocity emission ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is mirrored in the channel maps , which show that the peak emission is centered @xmath73 north ) of the line connecting the peaks in the blue and red wings .",
    "the central disk is therefore not strictly axisymmetric .",
    "there may also be additional spatial and kinematic substructure of the gas very near the center and at the individual ir / radio nuclei which will require higher resolution .",
    "the spatial distributions of 1.315 mm ( 228 ghz ) continuum and co 2@xmath931 line emission are clearly different ( figure 3 ) .",
