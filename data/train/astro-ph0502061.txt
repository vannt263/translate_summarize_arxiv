    "may squeeze molecular clouds and induce subsequent birth of stars which otherwise may not have occurred . on the other hand",
    "the agitation may be so violent as to disperse the material , hindering further star - forming activity .",
    "triggered star formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comprehensive review )  as opposed to spontaneous cloud collapse  would have profound consequences in stellar population , chemical homogeneity , star formation efficiency , and cloud energetics .",
    "while the ob and young low - mass member stars are often distributed cospatially , in some cases low - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are seen to be located between the molecular cloud and the cluster .",
    "such a configuration can result from either triggered or spontaneous star formation . in the former case , high - mass stars form in dense molecular cores , and then their uv photons create an expanding strmgren sphere . the expanding ionization fronts ( i - fronts ) then compress nearby molecular clouds and trigger the formation of next - generation pms stars at the edge of clouds .",
    "alternatively , star formation may proceed in a spontaneous way ; that is , all stars form coevally but high - mass stars photoionize the surrounding clouds to expose the low - mass stars .    the orion complex is an active star - forming region with a wealth of star - forming signatures , such as high - mass star clusters , ob associations , low - mass young stars , giant molecular clouds , reflection nebulae and hii regions . because of its proximity , at @xmath2450  pc , it is a suitable laboratory for the study of star formation , especially for the interplay among high - mass stars , low - mass stars , and interstellar medium .",
    "bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) are usually found at the boundary of hii regions and the edge of molecular clouds .",
    "the morphology of a brc , e.g. , tightly curved or cometary rims with tails , is governed by the i - fronts from nearby ob stars , which compress the head of the brc , hence making the density of the apex higher than the other parts of the cloud .",
    "the imprints of such causality offer the possibility to delineate the intricate processes of sequential star formation . @xcite",
    "catalogue 89 brcs associated with iras point sources in both northern and southern hemispheres , some of which are also associated with herbig - haro objects and molecular outflows .",
    "these brcs are potential sites where triggered star formation might have taken place .",
    "@xcite present a multiwavelength study of triggered star formation in the w5 hii region .",
    "they find some young stellar objects around w5 and suggest that the expanding hii region has induced star formation in the surrounding molecular clouds .",
    "this paper provides observational diagnosis to identify pms stars from their characteristic near - infrared colors .",
    "in particular , pms stars associated with brcs in the orion star - forming region are used as a tool to chronologize the star formation history to show how massive stars trigger the star formation processes in the region .",
    "we describe in  2 our methodology in selection of the pms sample in parts of the orion and monoceros star - forming regions . in ",
    "3 we discuss how our data lend supportive evidence of triggered star formation in the orion brcs .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) are known to emit copious x - ray emission , and a majority of them have been identified by optical spectroscopic observations of strong x - ray sources ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in comparison ,",
    "classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) are at earlier evolutionary stages , before much of the circumstellar material has been dispersed .",
    "ctts show characteristic strong ir excess emission , particularly at mid - infrared wavelengths , and h@xmath1 emission ( equivalent width @xmath3 5   ) . the ir excess is believed to originate from heated circumstellar dust , whereas the h@xmath1 emission come from an active chromosphere and the boundary layer between the young star and the fast rotating circumstellar disk . as young stars evolve and gradually clear away the surrounding material , they show different amounts of ir excesses , hence their near - infrared colors @xcite .",
    "our pms candidates have been selected on the basis of their near - infrared colors .",
    "this project started in early 2003 , when we used the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) second incremental data release to identify ctts candidates in the orion and monoceros regions .",
    "since the 2mass released their all - sky data in march 2003 , we have updated the photometry of our sample accordingly .",
    "the 2mass database provides unbiased photometry in the near - infrared @xmath4 ( 1.25  ) , @xmath5 ( 1.65  ) , and @xmath6 ( 2.17  ) bands to a limiting 15.8 , 15.1 , and 14.3  mag , respectively , with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 10 .",
    "the comprehensive database offers a good opportunity to identify in a systematic way young star candidates associated with molecular clouds .",
    "we use known wtts @xcite , ctts @xcite and herbig ae / be stars @xcite as our template to select pms candidates .",
    "these lists of wtts , ctts and herbig ae / be stars , taken from the literature and not confined to any special region in the sky , serve to the compilation of their descriptive 2mass colors .",
    "figure  [ fig : colors ] plots the @xmath7 versus @xmath8 color - color diagram , extracted from the 2mass catalog for these pms stars .",
    "only sources with high snr photometry are included .",
    "the fact that the ctts , wtts , and herbig ae / be stellar populations appear to occupy different regions in figure  [ fig : colors ] enables us to pick out candidate pms stars .",
    "the 2mass database , with usually simultaneous measurements in all 3 bands , is particularly useful for a diagnostic of young stellar population based on colors , because a majority of pms stars are variables .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] is the locus for main sequence stars , for which the wtts are seen to follow .",
    "the ctts are found to lie approximately between the two parallel dotted lines , defined empirically by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are 2mass magnitudes , and the slope is specified by the interstellar reddening law @xcite .",
    "the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : colors ] represents the dereddened ctts locus @xcite , modified to the 2mass photometry @xcite , with @xmath14 .",
    "the dotted parallel lines separate ctts from herbig ae / be and from reddened main sequence stars . the fact that different kinds of pms stars occupy separated regions in the @xmath7 versus @xmath8 color - color diagram enables us to identify candidate young stars in star - forming regions .",
    "we select 2mass point sources with colors between the 2 parallel lines and above the dashed line as ctts candidates .",
    "inevitably our selection would miss some ctts to the left of the parallel lines , where slightly reddened ctts and reddened main sequence stars can not be distinguished by their 2mass colors .",
    "this poses no difficulty for our study because our goal is not to collect a complete pms sample , but to use young stars as probes of the star formation history in the region .",
    "data at longer wavelengths , e.g. , at l band and beyond , would serve to better discriminate between moderately reddened ctts and reddened main sequence stars @xcite .    to improve photometry accuracy and",
    "to remove extended sources from the 2mass point source catalog , we have set further criteria in selection of our ctts candidates .",
    "these may be useful to other users of the 2mass data , so we summarize them in table  1 .",
    "the photometric quality flag ( ph_qual = aaa ) means snr @xmath15 10 , and with a corrected photometric uncertainty less than 0.10857  mag , an indication of the best quality detection in terms of photometry and astrometry .",
    "the blend flag ( bl_flg ) = 111 implies no source blending ; the contamination and confusion flag ( cc_flg ) = 000 means the source is unaffected by known artifacts , or artifact is not detected in the band .",
    "only sources without a neighboring star within 5@xmath16 ( prox @xmath3 5.0@xmath16 ) are considered , so as to avoid possible photometric confusion .",
    "we select only sources which have optical counterparts ( a @xmath17 0 ) and identified ctts candidates by the near - ir colors prescribed in the last paragraph .",
    "some slightly extended sources may be included in the 2mass point source catalog , notably nuclei of galaxies . in order to single out these non - stellar sources ,",
    "additional criteria have been imposed .",
    "an extended source can be discriminated against a point source by the difference between its measured fluxes determined with a point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting and with aperture photometry .",
    "conceivably , an extended source measured by psf photometry would lose some flux at the outer image halo .",
    "the 2mass entries , @xmath18 $ ] , are default magnitudes mostly derived from psf fitting , whereas the entries , @xmath19 $ ] , are standard aperture magnitudes derived from 4@xmath16 radius photometric aperture",
    ". therefore the parameter @xmath20 should be close to 0 for point sources and significantly non - zero for extended objects .",
    "we set @xmath21 as our selection criterion .",
    "finally , we choose sources with snr greater than 30 ( @xmath22\\_snr > 30 $ ] ) for high - quality photometry .",
    "these stringent criteria would bias against sources in crowded regions , but as shown below , prove to lead to a high success rate in selection of ctts candidates .",
    "in addition to 2mass , we have made use of other survey data , such as the h@xmath1 @xcite , @xmath23 reddening @xcite , and iras 100  @xmath0 emission in the orion star - forming region to trace , respectively , the distribution of ionization fronts , cloud extinction and ir radiation with respect to the spatial distribution of our sample of young stars .      to justify the selection criteria outlined above , we have chosen 32 relatively bright ctts candidates for spectroscopic observations to check their youth nature .",
    "low - dispersion spectra , with dispersion of 200   / mm , 4.8   / pixel , were taken with the 2.16  m optical telescope of the beijing astronomical observatory in 2003 january  22 , 23 , 30 , and 31 .",
    "an omr ( optomechanics research inc . )",
    "spectrograph was used with a tektronix 1024@xmath241024 ccd detector covering 4000 - 9000   .",
    "the data were processed with standard noao / iraf packages .",
    "after the bias and flat - fielding corrections , the iraf package kpnoslit was used to extract , and to calibrate the wavelength and flux of , each spectrum .",
    "table  2 lists the results of our spectroscopic observations .",
    "the first column gives the sequence number .",
    "columns 25 list the 2mass identification and photometry .",
    "columns 69 are , respectively , the spectral type , the associated star - forming region , forbidden line(s ) in the spectrum if any , and other names for the source .",
    "we note that stars no .",
    "3 , 5 , 6 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 22 , and 24 in table  2 show continuous or veiled spectra with [ oi ] and/or [ sii ] emission lines ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) , characteristics of extreme t tauri stars for which the forbidden lines originate from jets or winds seen commonly in class  i sources @xcite .",
    "these 32 candidates , distributed between ra@xmath256  h covering part of the orion and part of the monoceros star - forming regions , have been chosen somewhat randomly .",
    "our spectroscopic observations show that 24 of the 32 candidates are found indeed to be pre - main sequence stars , with the other 4 as m - type stars and 4 as carbon stars .",
    "all 24 confirmed pms stars are associated with star - forming regions , but otherwise the m stars and carbon stars are scattered around the region .",
    "this indicates that our criteria to select pms stars from the 2mass database are valid and very effective . if the same set of criteria are applied to sources seen against nearby molecular clouds  as is the case here in orion and monoceros bright - rimmed clouds  for which both background and foreground field star contamination is small , the success rate should be conceivably even higher .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmdforbidden ] shows the color - magnitude and color - color diagrams of the 24 spectroscopically confirmed ctts in table  2 .",
    "stars with and without forbidden lines are denoted with different symbols . in the color - magnitude diagram , the stellar absolute @xmath4 magnitude , as the ordinate ,",
    "is derived by adopting a distance of 450  pc to the orion clouds and a distance of 830  pc to the monr2 and ldn1652 star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "one sees that in either the color - magnitude diagram or the color - color diagram , the ctts with forbidden lines are systematically further away from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , implying that the ctts with forbidden lines are younger than those without .",
    "this result , that younger ctts are located to the upper - right corner in the near - infrared color - color diagram , is consistent with that obtained by @xcite .",
    "class  i sources , with very red colors , @xmath25  mag , are located even more toward the upper - right corner in the diagram .",
    "in contrast , the wtts are close to the main sequence locus , whereas the ctts occupy a region between those of the class  i sources and the wtts .",
    "this is understood as an evolutionary sequence ; namely a young star evolves in such a color - color diagram from upper right to lower left , in a sequence from a class  i protostar , a ctts with forbidden lines , a ctts without forbidden , to a wtts .",
    "the spectroscopic observations demonstrate that our selection of pms sample based on 2mass colors is reliable , and that the color - magnitude diagram and color - color diagram can be used , particularly for those ctts too faint to obtain their spectra , to diagnose their evolutionary status .",
    "we are now ready to apply these tools to identify a sample of pms stars in star - forming clouds , which in turn allows us to probe the star formation activity and history in the region .",
    "we present the analysis of the pms population in relation with the bright - rimmed molecular clouds and massive stars to investigate how triggered star formation might have taken place .",
    "this paper concentrates on the orion brcs , ic2118 , ldn1616 , ldn1634 , and perhaps also orioneast , associated with the trapezium , and b30 and b35 associated with the @xmath26  orionis ( figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "the sample used in this study consists of ( 1 )  33 ctts candidates ( including 2 confirmed ctts in ic2118 and 1 in ldn1634 , see table  2 ) around the trapezium , in the region ra@xmath27  h to 5h30 m , and dec@xmath28 to @xmath29 , and ( 2 )  18 ctts candidates around @xmath26 orionis , in ra@xmath25h25 m to 5h50 m , and dec@xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "ic2118 , ldn1616 , and ldn1634 are isolated molecular clouds to the west of the oriona , as part of the orion star - forming region .",
    "the 3 molecular clouds are all associated with strong iras 100  @xmath0 emission , and are apparently engraved by the uv radiation from the trapezium , with the bright - rimmed boundaries , as outlined by h@xmath1 filaments , presumably shaped by the i - fronts ( figure  [ fig : images5 ] ) .",
    "we differentiate the ctts physically close to the brcs from those further away , as marked in figure  [ fig : images5 ] .",
    "the spectra of stars no .",
    "14 , 15 and 16 , associated with ic2118 and ldn1634 , all exhibit forbidden lines [ sii ] and/or [ oi ] , suggestive of their youth .",
    "the spatial distribution of these ctts likely traces a pre - existent molecular cloud complex for which ic2118 , ldn1616 , and ldn1634 are merely survivors .",
    "ldn1621 and ldn1622 , also called orioneast @xcite , are at about the same distance as orionb @xcite .",
    "interaction between the orioneast clouds and the i - front can be seen in figure  [ fig : images6 ] .",
    "b30 and b35 are associated with s264 , an extended hii region excited by the o8iii star @xmath26 orionis and surrounded by , but slightly off centered of , a ring molecular cloud @xcite . @xcite",
    "have surveyed about 100 square degrees around @xmath26 orionis , and found 83 h@xmath1 emission - line stars , mostly distributed along a bar - like structure extending on either side from @xmath26orionis to b30 and to b35 .",
    "these authors suggest that the h@xmath1 stars provide a fossil record of a pre - existent giant molecular cloud complex . @xcite",
    "have identified pms stars in the region around @xmath26 orionis by statistical removal of field stars in the optical color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the seeming lack of the youngest ( 1 - 2 myr ) pms stars inside the molecular ring , despite the apparent abundance of such stars in b30 and b35 , leads @xcite to postulate a possible supernova explosion near @xmath26 orionis that terminated recent star formation in the vicinity .",
    "the ctts candidates we have identified spread along the bar - like structure , but clearly within the central cavity previously thought to be free of ongoing star - forming activities .",
    "prominent h@xmath1 and iras 100  @xmath0 emission are seen in both b30 and b35 on the sides facing @xmath26orionis ( figure  [ fig : images7 ] ) , signifying the interaction between @xmath26orionis and these two brcs .",
    "the radiation - driven implosion ( rdi ) model , based on the `` rocket effect '' , proposed by @xcite and further developed by @xcite and by @xcite , links brcs to pms stars .",
    "the uv photons from massive stars ionize the outer layers of a nearby cloud , which expand to the surrounding medium with an i - front speed @xmath2 10  km  s@xmath32 .",
    "the expanding i - front plows the cloud material which , when exceeding the local critical mass , collapses to form new stars .",
    "there are two phases , namely collapsing and cometary phases , for the formation and evolution of a cometary globule @xcite . in the initial collapsing phase ,",
    "the uv photons ionize the surface layers of a cloud , causing the cloud to elongate in the direction of the high - mass stars .",
    "this phase lasts some 10@xmath33  yr .",
    "subsequently , the cloud would remain in a quasi - stationary state , with small - scale condensations close to critical equilibria .",
    "if the i - front out - pressures the molecular cloud , the density increases to beyond the critical value and the collapse of the condensations leads to star formation , leaving behind a chain of pms stars reminiscent of the original , elongated cloud . on the other hand ,",
    "if the i - front does not out - pressure the molecular gas , the i - front stalls and there should be no star forming . this cometary phase may last a few million to a few 10@xmath34  years . eventually the entire cometary globule would be evaporated by the uv photons .    according to the rdi model ,",
    "the surface of a brc facing the massive stars is compressed by the i - fronts .",
    "@xcite observed b35 and ldn1634 in hco@xmath35 and other molecular line transitions to trace the swept - up gas ridge and overly dense regions .",
    "they find that the surfaces of b35 and ldn1634 facing the massive stars are indeed being compressed , as the rdi model predicts .",
    "@xcite listed several dozens of bright - rimmed clouds , cometary globules and reflection clouds in the orionob1 .",
    "they propose these present an evolutionary sequence and collectively call them `` remnant molecular clouds '' .",
    "we find that not all remnant molecular clouds are associated with ctts . instead , only those brcs associated with prominent h@xmath1 and iras 100  @xmath0 emission , e.g. , ic2188 , ldn1616 , and ldn1634 , have ongoing star formation ( figure  [ fig : images8 ] ) , consistent with the rdi model .",
    "the h@xmath1 filaments and the 100  @xmath0 emission trace , respectively , the i - fronts and dense regions in a molecular cloud . obviously in ic2188 , ldn1616 , and ldn1634 , the i - front has out - pressured the molecular clouds and thus triggered star formation .",
    "the two brcs b30 and b35 in the vicinity of @xmath26  orionis are additional two such examples of triggered star formation .",
    "remnant clouds without star formation are simply the outcome of i - fronts with insufficient pressure .",
    "the rdi model predicts the cloud to collapse perpendicular to the direction of the ionizing massive stars . this has been observed in ldn1616 and ic2118 by @xcite , for which the @xmath36co , @xmath37co , and c@xmath38o emission contours show elongation roughly toward the trapezium",
    ".      triggered star formation is a sequential process .",
    "massive stars form first , and their i - fronts expand to and compress nearby molecular clouds , prompting the next - generation stars to form .",
    "the process may continue until the cloud is consumed and no more star - forming material is available . as time passes",
    ", the pms stars would line up between the massive stars and the molecular cloud , along which the stars farther away from the massive stars , and thus closer to the molecular cloud , should be progressively younger .",
    "the youngest stellar objects , namely protostars ( class  0 and class  i objects , @xcite ) , would still be embedded within the cloud .",
    "our data indicate a systematic brightness difference among revealed ctts , in the sense that brighter ctts are more distant from @xmath26  orionis ( cf .",
    "[ fig : images7 ] ) .",
    "we consider this as the consequence of triggered star formation .",
    "initially , the b30 and b35 clouds might have been extended toward @xmath26  orionis , perhaps with a bar - like structure @xcite . the i - front from @xmath26  orionis propagates and rams through the clouds , leaving behind newborn stars . figure  [ fig : lamoricc ] plots the color - magnitude diagram in the @xmath26  orionis region .",
    "indeed the ctts closer to b30 and b35 are progressively younger , and away from zero - age main sequence @xcite .",
    "the brightest ctts , close to b30 and b35 , may be among the youngest which have just revealed themselves on the birthline and begun their descent down the hayashi tracks .",
    "the same phenomenon , namely the ctts closer to the brcs are perceptibly younger , is seen in ldn1616 , ldn1634 , and ic2118 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ic2118cc ] ) .",
    "the star formation sequence is similar , except here with the trapezium as the triggering source .",
    "figure  [ fig : lamoricc ] also shows the color - color diagram of the @xmath26  orionis region , in which the ctts physically closer to brcs are located to the upper - right corner .",
    "the extinction values in these brcs , derived from @xcite , are in general too low to affect the apparent colors significantly .",
    "this implies these ctts are intrinsically young . in ldn1616 , ldn1634 , and ic2118",
    ", we also find similar results as in the @xmath26  orionis region ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ic2118cc ] ) .",
    "some very young objects are known to exist in these regions , for example with class  0 sources in b30 ( rno  43 mm , @xcite ) and in ldn1616 ( l1616  mms1a , @xcite ) , and with class  i sources in b35 and in ldn1634 @xcite .",
    "each of them is indeed embedded in , and close to the apex of , the associated cloud , as expected in the rdi model .",
    "we are apparently witnessing an ongoing star formation sequence , with coexistence of ctts , younger pms associated with brcs , to the youngest protostars embedded within the clouds .",
    "in the triggered star - formation scenario , the ages of the concurrent ob stars must be longer than the ages of the second - generation stars plus the i - front traveling time .",
    "the stars @xmath39  ori  a , b , c , and d , with spectral types b0.5v , b3v , o6 : , and b0.5v , respectively @xcite , are the most massive members in the trapezium and the main sources to create the i - fronts . the star @xmath39  ori  c may be somewhat peculiar in its evolutionary status @xcite , so we adopt the age of @xmath39  ori  a and d , both of spectral type b0.5v with a lifetime of 6@xmath2410@xmath40  yr @xcite to represent the ages of the ob stars .    assuming ic2118 , ldn1616 , and the trapezium are at the same distance from us , ic2118 and ldn1616 are thus separated from the trapezium by about 55  pc . with an i - front speed ,",
    "i.e. , the sound speed in an hii region , @xmath2 10  km  s@xmath32 , it takes some 5.5@xmath41  yr for the i - front to traverse .",
    "the lifetimes of ctts range from a few 10@xmath33 to a few 10@xmath40  yr . the ctts associated with the brcs are younger than those outside the clouds (  3.2 ) , but even for the oldest ctts in the region , the combined timescale 6@xmath41  yr is consistent with the age of the trapezium .",
    "likewise , the set of timescales can be estimated for the @xmath26  orionis system , which consists of an o star and an hii region surrounded by an unusual molecular cloud ring .",
    "the radius of the molecular cloud ring is approximately 2.6  deg , or about 20  pc at 450  pc distance , so it would take about 2  myr for the i - front , originated from @xmath26  ori , to travel through the hii region .",
    "the age of @xmath26  orionis , an o8iii star with a luminosity of 340,000  l@xmath42 and an effective temperature of 34,700  k @xcite can be inferred from evolutionary tracks @xcite to be about 3@xmath41  yr . here again , the age of the triggerer @xmath26  orionis ( 3@xmath41  yr ) is consistently longer than the expanding timescale of i - front ( 2@xmath41  yr ) plus the age of the ctts .",
    "the spatial distribution of ctts provides telltale clues to the star formation history in a molecular cloud . according to the rdi model",
    ", small - scale condensations compressed by the i - fronts would reach critical equilibria first at the surface layers of brcs , where the ctts should be found .",
    "if ctts exist far ahead of the i - front and are still embedded in the molecular cloud , the star formation must have proceeded in a spontaneous manner , i.e. the embedded ctts were formed at the same time with their massive counterparts . on the other hand , if ctts are only seen near the surfaces of  and none embedded inside  the brcs , triggered star formation is clearly evinced . in b30 , b35 , ic2118 , ldn1616 , ldn1634 and orioneast ,",
    "ctts are seen only between the massive stars and brcs , and on the compressed ( i.e. , dense ) sides of brcs ( see figure  [ fig : images5 ] , [ fig : images6 ] , and [ fig : images7 ] ) .",
    "no ctts are found further down the compressed regions into the molecular clouds .    to investigate",
    "if the brcs are indeed void of embedded pms stars , we have computed the probability of our failure to detect them , if they actually existed , because of excessive dust extinction in the clouds .",
    "table  3 contains the extinction of ic2118 , ldn1616 , ldn1634 , b30 , and b35 .",
    "column 1 lists the 5 brcs .",
    "columns 2 to 4 are the @xmath23 , a@xmath43 , and a@xmath44 in each cloud . the values of @xmath23 are derived from @xcite , and a@xmath43/e@xmath45=3.1 and a@xmath44 = 0.282a@xmath43 @xcite are used to obtain a@xmath43 and a@xmath44 .",
    "if there were ctts embedded in a particular cloud , we would like to estimate how many of them would have hidden from our detection .",
    "we created the @xmath23 map @xcite for each cloud , and assumed the same @xmath4 band luminosities for the embedded ctts as those for the visible ctts outside the cloud .",
    "we performed monte carlo computation to distribute randomly the hypothetical ctts stars on the @xmath23 map to check their detectability , given the 2mass detection limit of @xmath46 ( snr=30 ) based on selection criteria discussed in   2 .",
    "the probability of non - detection of embedded ctts in each cloud is given as column 5 .",
    "as can be seen , the probability of ctts that would have escaped our detection is universally very low , @xmath47 , implying that the extinction in these clouds is too low to make any embedded pms stars invisible . in other words ,",
    "if there were any embedded sources , we would have detected them .",
    "we conclude therefore that the ctts near the surfaces of the brcs are not part of a young stellar population originally embedded in the molecular clouds and later revealed by uv photons from massive stars .",
    "they are relics of triggered star formation .",
    "most pms stars are associated with molecular clouds , but some are distinctly away from any clouds .",
    "these isolated pms stars , with their juvenility , could not have traversed from the birthplace to their current positions .",
    "they are revealed as a consequence of surplus star - forming material being stripped off by radiation and winds from nearby massive stars , leaving behind pms stars away from molecular clouds .",
    "massive stars play a dual role in star formation .",
    "the i - front compression may induce birth of stars which otherwise could not have formed .",
    "alternatively molecular clouds may become highly disturbed , hence dispersed , making subsequent star formation impossible .",
    "even if triggered star formation is initiated , the working is confined to the outer layers of a cloud .",
    "it is therefore expected that star formation may be efficient in localized , compressed regions , but perhaps not so in the entire cloud .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) in a brc can be estimated by the ratio of stellar mass to the total mass of stars plus cloud .",
    "@xcite observed the compressed regions of b35 and ldn1634 in the hco@xmath35 molecular line and determined the total compressed mass of molecular clouds to be 27 m@xmath42 for b35 and 28 m@xmath42 for ldn1634 , respectively .",
    "we have identified 3 ctts in each of b35 and ldn1634 , so assuming 0.51 m@xmath42 for a typical ctts , the sfes of the compressed material in b35 and in ldn1634 are about 510% , higher than that of a few percent ( @xmath48% ) in other nearby star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "we have developed an empirical set of criteria to select candidate classical t tauri stars on the basis of the infrared colors in the 2mass point source catalog . among the 32 candidates we have obtained the spectra ,",
    "24 are found to be bona fide pms objects , 4 are m - type stars and the rest 4 are carbon stars , which shows the effectiveness of our selection method .",
    "the young stellar population provides a tool to trace ongoing star formation activities .",
    "we find supportive evidence of triggered star formation in the following bright - rimmed clouds , b35 , b30 , ic2118 , ldn1616 , ldn1634 , and orion east .    1 .",
    "our data supports the radiation - driven implosion model that links the formation of brcs and of stars .",
    "the ionization fronts from ob stars compress a nearby cloud , and if the density of the compressed gas exceeds a certain critical value , new stars would be formed .",
    "not all brcs are associated with ctts .",
    "only brcs associated with strong iras 100  @xmath0 emission ( tracer of high density ) and h@xmath1 emission ( tracer of ionization front ) show signs of ongoing star formation .",
    "we find that ctts closer to brcs are progressively younger , a configuration consistent with the sequential process of triggered star formation .",
    "the brightest ctts , spatially closest to brcs , are the young stellar objects which just reveal themselves on the birthline and begin to descend down the hayashi tracks .",
    "the ages of the concurrent ob stars are comparable or older than the ages of the next - generation stars plus the i - front traveling times . these timescales are consistent with the causality , or sequential , nature of the star formation process .",
    "ctts are found only in between the ob stars and the molecular clouds with which the ionization fronts interact .",
    "there are no ctts ahead of the ionization fronts into the clouds",
    ". the lack of embedded ctts can not be due to detection sensitivity because the extinction of these brcs is generally low .",
    "current star formation in the brcs takes place in the compressed outer layers of the molecular clouds .",
    "the relatively enhanced star formation efficiency suggests a triggering  as opposed to a spontaneous  star formation process .",
    "this research makes use of data products from the two - micron all - sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "we also use the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa ) , supported by the national science foundation .",
