    "the remarkable success of the qcd description of two - jet event shape distributions has made these observables one of the most useful tools to test our understating of the dynamics of strong interactions , both in the perturbative ( pt ) and non - perturbative ( np ) regime .",
    "this is because event - shape distributions span a wide range of physical scales , from the region where the event shape @xmath1 is large , described well by fixed - order qcd , to the exclusive @xmath2 region where hadronisation effects dominate , through the intermediate region where one needs to resum large infrared and collinear logarithms .",
    "the combination of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) predictions and next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) resummation , supplemented with non - perturbative ( np ) hadronisation corrections provided by monte carlo ( mc ) event generators , has lead to one of the most precise determinations of the qcd coupling @xmath3  @xcite .    in view of the fact that hadronisation corrections are suppressed by inverse power of the process hard scale @xmath4 , in recent years",
    "it has been attempted to describe two - jet event shape distributions at hadron level by simply adding to the nll resummation the np shift @xmath5 originated by leading @xmath6 power corrections , which is a reliable approximation as long as @xmath7 .",
    "the shift has a remarkably simple structure , being the product of a calculable coefficient @xmath8 , which depends on the considered shape variable , and a genuine np quantity @xmath9 , the mean transverse momentum of large - angle hadrons produced in the collision , which is variable independent ( _ universal _ ) .",
    "the universality of @xmath9 , and hence of @xmath6 power corrections , has been thoroughly tested both in @xmath0 annihilation and dis , and is found to hold within 20% ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this universality property is based on two facts .",
    "the first is that particles responsible for leading power corrections are low transverse momentum hadrons in a central rapidity region , away from the hard jets .",
    "any of these hadrons @xmath10 contributes to a two - jet event shape @xmath1 with an extra @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the hadron transverse momentum and rapidity with respect to the jet axis .",
    "the second is that central hadrons are distributed uniformly in rapidity .",
    "this ensures that in the region @xmath14 , where only leading power corrections are important , the dependence of @xmath15 on rapidity and transverse momentum gets factorised  @xcite : @xmath16    among all models that , for two - jet events , predict a uniform rapidity distribution of central hadrons , the dispersive dmw approach  @xcite makes it possible to extend eq .   to multi - jet event shapes , where there is no natural way to identify @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the starting point is the probability @xmath17 of emitting a soft dressed gluon @xmath10 from a quark - antiquark pair ( whose momenta are @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) in a colour singlet : @xmath20 where @xmath3 is the physical cmw coupling  @xcite .",
    "the cmw coupling is then extended at low transverse momenta via a dispersion relation , and the very same probability @xmath17 is exploited to compute np corrections  @xcite .",
    "the resulting shift @xmath21 has the same form as in eq .  , where the @xmath8 coefficient is identical and the np parameter @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of @xmath22 , the average of the dispersive coupling below the merging scale @xmath23 , as follows  @xcite : @xmath24 here the milan factor @xmath25 accounts for non - inclusiveness of event - shape variables .",
    "one can now naturally extend the above analysis to multi - jet event shapes , where the soft dressed gluon probability is given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 the colour charge of hard parton @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 the invariant transverse momentum and rapidity with respect to the emitting dipole @xmath31 .",
    "this gives the following result for the shift : @xmath32 the above expression states that np corrections to multi - jet event shapes depend on the same parameter @xmath22 encountered for two - jet shapes .",
    "moreover , they depend in a non - trivial way on the colour of the underlying hard event through the correlation matrices @xmath33 and on the event geometry ( the angles between the jets ) through the calculable coefficients @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the simplest environment in which the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltav - multi ] ) can be tested is three - jet events . here",
    "colour conservation ensures that the colour matrices @xmath35 are in fact proportional to the identity , thus simplifying considerably both the pt and the np analysis .",
    "two three - jet event shapes have been studied in @xmath0 annihilation , the @xmath36-parameter  @xcite and the thrust minor @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "both variables are small when the three hard jets are in a near - to - planar configuration , and measure radiation outside the event plane .",
    "we present here the first ever comparison of theoretical predictions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 differential distributions and existing data provided by the aleph collaboration  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions are at the state - of - the - art level , that is nll resummation matched to the nlo calculation obtained with nlojet++  @xcite , and leading @xmath6 np corrections computed with the dispersive method  @xcite .",
    "events with three separated jets are selected by requiring the three - jet resolution parameter @xmath38 in the durham algorithm to be larger than @xmath39 .",
    "it is then clear that different values of @xmath39 correspond to different event geometries .",
    "l0.5    figure  [ fig : dpar_ee ] shows the result of a simultaneous fit of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the @xmath36-parameter distribution at @xmath42 corresponding to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45-@xmath46 contour plots in the @xmath3-@xmath47 plane are plotted together with results for other distributions of two - jet event shapes .",
    "there is a remarkable consistency among the various distributions , thus strongly supporting the idea that universality of @xmath6 power corrections holds also for three - jet variables .",
    "this leads to the non - trivial implication that leading power corrections are indeed sensitive to the colour and the geometry of the hard underlying event , and moreover this dependence is the one predicted by eq .  .",
    "r0.5    the comparison to data is less satisfactory for @xmath37 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : tmin_ee ] .",
    "there one notices a discrepancy between theory and data at large values of @xmath37 . to track down the origin of the problem",
    ", one can look at hadronisation corrections produced by mc programs , defined as the ratio of the mc results at hadron and parton level . from the plots in  @xcite one",
    "can see that hadronisation corrections for the @xmath36-parameter are always larger than one , corresponding to a positive shift , consistent with our predictions . on the contrary ,",
    "hadronisation corrections for @xmath37 become smaller than one at large @xmath37 , a feature that will never be predicted by a model based on a single dressed gluon emission from a three hard parton system .",
    "this issue is present also in the heavy - jet mass and wide - jet broadening distributions , and requires further theoretical investigation .",
    "observables that measure the out - of - event - plane radiation in three - jet events can be introduced also in other hard processes .    in dis two observables have been already measured .",
    "one is a variant of @xmath37  @xcite , where all momenta are in the breit frame , and the event plane is formed by the virtual photon direction and the thrust major axis , defined as the direction that maximises the projection of transverse momenta .",
    "differential @xmath37 distributions have been measured both by the h1  @xcite and zeus collaboration  @xcite , and fits of experimental data are currently in progress .",
    "the other observable is the distribution in the transverse energy correlation @xmath48 , defined as  @xcite @xmath49 the interesting features of the @xmath48 distribution are that it approaches a constant for small @xmath50 and that it has fractional power corrections .    in hadron - hadron collisions",
    "one can consider for instance the production of a @xmath51 boson @xmath52 in association with a hard jet @xmath53 .",
    "the event plane is determined by the beam and the @xmath51 direction , and one can study  @xcite @xmath54 where the sum is extended to all hadrons not too close to the beam pipe , and the normalisation is fixed so as to cancel systematic uncertainties in the jet energy scale . in order to compare data with existing predictions , @xmath55 should be taken as large as is experimentally possible .",
    "the interest in this variable is that its distribution can take large corrections from the underlying event , thus making it a useful tool to tune mc models of minimum bias and multiple hard collisions .",
    "we look forward to experimental investigations in this direction .",
    "special thanks go to giulia zanderighi , for many years of fruitful collaboration on this subject .",
    "i also thank the organisers , in particular those of the hadronic final state session , for the pleasant and stimulating atmosphere they were able to create during the workshop .",
