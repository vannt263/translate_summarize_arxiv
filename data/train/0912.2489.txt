    "study of interference of particles with internal degrees of freedom e.g. a photon with its two polarization states and a neutron with its two spin-1/2 states has been of interest since long .",
    "the famous @xmath0 spinor symmetry experiments with unpolarized neutrons of rauch et al .",
    "@xcite and werner et al .",
    "@xcite are some notable early examples . in optics , the young s double slit experiment of pescetti @xcite with polarized light and its interpretation in terms of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics is another interesting early example .",
    "the overall phase of the state of an evolving quantum system with n internal states is nontrivial when a possibility of interference of the state with a copy of the unevolved state ( produced with the use of a beamsplitter ) , or with a copy which has evolved differently , exists .",
    "the simplest example would be a beam of neutrons , with its two spin states , passing through a box containing an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field and interfering with a part of the beam which has either travelled through free space or through a box contining a different magnetic field . as is now widely recognized , the first definition of a phase difference between beams in two different internal states in such a system was given by pancharatnam in the context of the two - state system of polarization of light .",
    "pancharatnam made two important contributions to the physics of the phase @xcite .",
    "firstly he proposed that the phase difference between two waves in different polarization states is the phase that must be introduced so that their superposition yields maximum intensity .",
    "secondly pancharatnam showed that if two states a and b are in phase by the above definition , a and c are in phase , then b and c have a phase difference equal to half the solid angle subtended at the centre by the geodesic triangle abc on the sphere representing the states of the two - state system .",
    "this constituted the first formulation of the geometric phase .",
    "following the discovery of the geometric phase in the context of adiabatic cyclic quantum evolutions by berry in 1983 @xcite , this quantity is sometimes called  berry phase \" .",
    "the next step forward in the problem was the work of aharonov and anandan @xcite who showed that in an evolution where the state evolves cyclically , if a quantity called the dynamical phase which is equal to the time integral of @xmath1 ; @xmath2 being the hamiltonian of the system , is subtracted from the total phase , the remainder is independent of the hamiltonian of the system and is the same , modulo @xmath3 , for all evolutions involving the same cyclic path in the state space . for a two - state system they showed that this quantity is equal to half the solid angle subtended by the closed path at the centre of the state sphere i.e. it is a geometric phase .",
    "cyclic evolutions however form a very small sub - set of the complete set of evolutions in nature .",
    "even if the evolution is cyclic one may wish to consider only a part of the cycle . to define the phase of a state under a noncyclic evolution or for a partial cycle one needs to take recourse to pancharatnam s criterion mentioned above . the first attempt to decompose the phase so defined into a dynamical and a geometrical part",
    "was made in ref .",
    "the geometric phase for a noncyclic evolution was defined in this work as being equal to the integral of a two - form over the surface enclosed by the closed curve obtained by closing the open curve by  any geodesic arc \" connecting the final state to the initial state . for a two - state system",
    "this is equal to half the solid angle subtended by the closed surface at the center of the sphere .",
    "there are two problems with this definition .",
    "since the definition allows choice of any geodesic arc , if the open curve were closed by the longer geodesic arc connecting the final to the initial state , this definition gives a geometric phase which differs from the correct phase by @xmath4 .",
    "secondly , for systems more complicated than the two - state system , the projective hilbert space is difficult to visualize hence this definition is difficult to use .    following these developments , the present author , analyzing a gedanken polarization experiment @xcite , proposed an algebraic definition of the noncyclic geometric phase .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that the difference of the total phase as given by the pancharatnam s criterion and the dynamical phase as defined by aharonov and anandan in @xcite be defined as the geometric phase .",
    "it was stated that for a two - state system the geometric phase so defined equals half the solid angle of the closed curve obtained by closing the open curve with the shorter geodesic arc connecting the final state with the initial state . in this work",
    ", the reference beam was assumed to be in the same state as the initial state incident on the interferometer @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the variation of the phase of the evolved beam as a function of parameters of the hamiltonian has several counter - intuitive features . in some regions of the parameter space",
    "the phase was found to be insensitive to variation in the parameters while in other regions the phase was found to vary sharply and discontinuously in the vicinity of points of singularity in the parameter space exhibiting @xmath5 phase jumps .",
    "the shorter geodesic rule was shown to play an important role in understanding the counter - intuitive features . in a series of interference experiments involving polarization states of light @xcite",
    "these features and the existence of phase singularities were explicitly demonstrated . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the total integrated phase shift measured in going around a circuit encircling phase singularities in the parameter space is equal to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an integer and that it is zero for a circuit not enclosing a singularity .",
    "a review of these experiments and related work can be found in @xcite .    in view of recent interest in optics in noncyclic polarization changes and",
    "the pancharatnam phase @xcite we revisit the work first reported in @xcite and present a generalization of the considerations in @xcite to a scenario where both beams in the interferometer undergo unitary transformations and present a simple proof for the shorter geodesic rule in the more general context .",
    "this generalization provides a new degree of freedom to tune the location of the phase singularities in potential applications .",
    "we then propose a formal definition of the nonmodular total topological phase , identify its dynamical and geometric components and note that in a cyclic variation of the parameters of the hamiltonian , the dynamical phase change integrates to zero so that the nonmodular total phase change over a cycle is equal to the geometric phase change , each being equal to @xmath6 with @xmath7 being an integer .",
    "using a specific example of an su(2 ) transformation in one arm of the interferometer , the parameters of which are varied , while those in the other beam remain fixed , we demonstrate by numerical sumulation discrete transitions between regions where @xmath7 has different values so that the global slope of the topological phase curve can change abruptly for small changes in a parameter .",
    "we then present an effective hamiltonian picture for the interpretation of phase changes in an interferometer with @xmath8 elements .",
    "consider a version of the standard two - slit interference experiment shown in fig . 1 in which a coherent plane wave of particles with @xmath9 internal quantum states , propagating in the @xmath10-direction is incident on the two slits a and b.",
    "let @xmath11 be the incident wavefunction , represented by a column vector with @xmath9 complex numbers .",
    "let a box be placed in front of each of the slits such that passage through the box results in a unitary transformation @xmath12 or @xmath13 being applied to the wavefunction @xmath11 , changing its state to @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 which can be varied during the experiment .",
    "let a screen be placed some distance away where the two waves are superposed and the total intensity @xmath18 recorded at some point p on the screen .",
    "the states at p are given by , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are isotropic ( state - independent ) phases acquired by the wavefunctions @xmath23 and @xmath24 during propagation to the point p. let @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 are isotropic phase factors associated with @xmath28 and @xmath29 are su(2 ) transformations .",

    "the fringes on the screen are obtained due to variation of the phase @xmath33 along the screen .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is the complex fringe visibility whose phase is the phase difference between the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 and contains a shift in the fringe pattern from its position in the absence of the unitary transformations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the latter being given by arg @xmath35 .",
    "this shift consists of two parts : ( i ) the phase of an isotropic , i.e. polarization - independent phase factor @xmath36 and ( ii ) a polarization - dependent phase shift @xmath37 .",
    "we shall call ( ii ) the total pancharatnam phase associated with the evolution . the points in the parameter space at which the magnitude of the fringe visibility @xmath38 vanishes are the singular points where the contrast in the fringe pattern is zero and its phase is undefined .",
    "the singular points could be isolated points or lines or more complicated surfaces in the parameter space .",
    "the phase shift @xmath39 is determined modulo @xmath3 .",
    "however if small changes in parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 result in a change @xmath42 in the phase @xmath39 , the integrated phase shift @xmath43 is nonmodular .",
    "this is the quantity measured in the optical polarization implementations of the above experiment reported in ( @xcite-@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the physical implementation of the unitary transformations @xmath12 and @xmath13 will depend upon the nature of the particle used in the interference experiment . for polarization states of light waves , these would typically be a birefringence , possibly variable , distributed along the length of the box represented by the variable @xmath44 . in case of spin-1/2 states of neutrons or atoms",
    "these could be a magnetic field distribution , again possibly variable , along the length of the box .",
    "an infinitesimal unitary transformation in going from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , is given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 ( i.e. @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) is a hamiltonian function determined by the properties of the medium in the box represented by the parameters @xmath50 .",
    "the finite unitary transformation @xmath28 can be formally written as ,    @xmath51    as the particle propagates through the box @xmath52 or @xmath53 , the internal state of the particle will traverse some path in its state space , shown as @xmath54 or @xmath55 in fig.(2 ) .",
    "following aharonov and anandan @xcite , we can define dynamical phases @xmath56 and @xmath57 for these evolutions as ,    @xmath58    @xmath59    we now define the geometric phase for the evolution as :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the total pancharatnam phase for the evolution , defined modulo @xmath3 .",
    "for the special case when there is no evolution in arm b , the above definition reduces to the definition given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for a two - state system the geometric phase @xmath62 so defined is equal to half the solid angle of the area eabse in fig ( 2 ) where ab is the shorter geodesic arc joining the points a and b. this is the first main result in this paper .",
    "we now give a simple proof of the above shorter geodesic rule in the context of a two - state system .",
    "the proof consists of three steps :    \\1 .",
    "consider the two interference experiments shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) . in 1(a ) the two interfering beams are in different states a and b. in 1(b ) a polarizer @xmath63 that projects any state on state b is placed after the unitary transformation @xmath12 so that the two interfering beams are in the same state b. it is easy to show that the phase of the visibility in the two experiments is always the same .",
    "it is also well known that the action of the polarizer is to bring the state a to the state b along the shorter geodesic arc connecting a to b.    \\2 .",
    "now remove the unitary transformation @xmath13 in front of slit b and place a unitary transformation @xmath64 in front of the polarizer @xmath63 of experiment 1(b ) .",
    "this is shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "it is again easy to see that the phase of the visibility in expts .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) is always the same .    \\3 . since the expt . of fig.1(c )",
    "corresponds to a cyclic evolution of the state in arm a , one can use the decomposition of aharonov and anandan @xcite to the closed path eabse for which the dynamical phase is @xmath65 .",
    "it follows that @xmath62 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : totgeomphase ] ) is equal to half the solid angle of the area enclosed by the curve eabse .",
    "it is conceptually simpler if the evolution in the interferometer were looked upon as a two - step process , first , in the interferometer free from su(2 ) evolution , the transformation @xmath13 is introduced in arm b and second , the transformation @xmath12 is introduced in arm a. the first stage is represented by the circuit esbge in fig.2(a ) and the geometric phase acquired by beam b equals half the solid angle of the area esbge .",
    "the geometric phase acquired by beam a in the second stage of the evolution must therefore be equal to half the solid angle of the area eabge if the total geometric phase difference for the total evolution has to add up the value stated above .",
    "we therefore have the following very useful general result : if the reference beam in the interferometer is in state b ( does nt matter how it gets there ) and in the measurement beam the state evolves from e to a along the curve ea then the geometric phase acquired by beam a is equal to half the solid angle of the closed curve eabge where ab is the shorter geodesic arc between a and b and bge is the shorter geodesic arc between b and e. this is our second main result in this paper .",
    "the relation between the geometric phase so defined and the more familiar quantities formulated by berry @xcite and by aharonov and anandan @xcite can be illustrated by the following example .",
    "let a slab of a cholesteric liquid crystal with its helical axis along the direction of propagation be placed in the path of the beam .",
    "let each layer in the crystal , in addition to linear birefringence , have some optical activity .",
    "the propagation of polarized light through such a medium is equivalent to the evolution the spin state of a spin-1/2 particle under the action of a rotating magnetic field , the field making a constant angle @xmath66 with the axis of rotation of the field ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.48 ) .",
    "it is well known that under such a hamiltonian , an arbitrary state does not undergo cyclic evolution but a special pair of orthogonal states do @xcite .",
    "the aharonov- anandan phase relates only to the special pair of cyclic states .",
    "berry s phase is a further special case when the rotation of the state on the state sphere due to birefringence of a single layer is large compared to the rotation of the birefringence axis from one layer to the next ( adiabatic limit ) .",
    "for all states other than the cyclic states one needs the definition given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : totgeomphase ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the nonmodular phase . for small changes in the parameters @xmath67 ,",
    "the phase changes @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are related by ,    @xmath71    for finite changes in the parameters @xmath67 , we therefore have    @xmath72    the structure of eqs.([eq : totdynphasea ] ) and ( [ eq : totdynphaseb ] ) makes it fairly obvious that for any cyclic change in the parameters @xmath67 ,    @xmath73    eq .",
    "( [ eq : statement2 ] ) implies that if one of the parameters @xmath74 is an angle variable , @xmath75 must be a periodic function of this variable .",
    "now since a cyclic change in the parameters @xmath74 must leave the fringe pattern unchanged , eqs .",

    "( [ eq : statement3 ] ) is the third main result in this paper .",
    "an example of a cyclic change is rotation in space through @xmath6 of any of the objects used to make the unitary transformation @xmath77 or if the object has @xmath78-fold symmetry about some axis , rotation through @xmath79 about that axis . in case of the polarization experiments referred above ,",
    "the objects used to make the unitary transformations @xmath12 are quarterwave and halfwave retarders which have a two - fold symmetry about the beam axis and the parameters @xmath67 are angles of rotation of these optical elements about the beam axis . in this case therefore eqs .",
    "( [ eq : statement2 ] ) and ( [ eq : statement3 ] ) are true for rotations through @xmath80 of any one or more of these optical elements .",
    "for example in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , rotation of a halfwave retarder about the beam axis through an angle @xmath80 yields a total phase change equal to @xmath6 . a closed cycle in the space of parameters @xmath67 , where the net rotation of each optical element is zero , is a particularly interesting case where the eqs .",

    "( [ eq : statement2 ] ) and ( [ eq : statement3 ] ) then imply that these phase changes are geometric .    a geometric picture for the nonmodular geometric phase shift would be as follows .",

    "@xmath134 for this setup is given by ,    @xmath164    use of eqn.([eq : heff ] ) then leads to the hamiltonian matrix :    @xmath165    at the point of interference therefore beam a sees an effective rotating magnetic field whose parameters are related to those of the rotating field placed in the path of the beam by eqs.([eq : defheff]-[eq : cycliccond1 ] ) . for the special case of @xmath166 , i.e. for a rotating halfwave plate or a ",
    "@xmath4-flipper \" placed in the path of beam @xmath52 , the equations give a constant effective field along @xmath152 which is intuitively obvious .",
    "eqs.([eq : defheff]-[eq : cycliccond1 ] ) imply that for a rotating magnetic field whose magnitude corresponds to a larmor precession frequency @xmath167 , which makes a constant angle @xmath168 with the z - axis and which rotates about the z - axis with frequency @xmath169 , the entire state space undergoes cyclic evolution when the following condition is satisfied by the parameters @xmath170 and @xmath168 :    @xmath171    as an illustration of the significance of this condition , in the example of the cholesteric liquid crystal discussed earlier , when the parameters of the sample satisfy the condition corresponding to eq.([eq : cycliccond2 ] ) , the sample behaves , with respect to polarization , as a piece of plain glass .",
    "we note that while the total phase shift obtained in both the pictures is obviously the same the decomposition into a dynamical and a geometric phase is different . in the effective hamiltonian picture ,",
    "the total nonmodular phase shift is given by @xmath172 where    @xmath173    the dynamical phase is given by eq.([eq : totdynphasea ] ) with @xmath48 replaced by @xmath145 and the nonmodular geometric phase is given by the area swept by the moving geodesic arc ab alone .",
    "in this paper we have explored a new dimension of the noncyclic geometric phase acquired by an evolving state namely its dependence on the reference state used for interference .",
    "this is like studying the phase of matrix elements of the time evolution operator @xmath140 other than the diagonal matrix element studied earlier .",
    "we have presented two different ways of understanding nonmodular phase changes in a generic interference setup shown in fig.1 , where the unitary transformation @xmath12 is a function of some variables @xmath174 which can be varied in time . in the first picture one",
    "considers evolution through the sequence of elements whose product is @xmath12 at time @xmath158 , computes the total pancharatnam phase shift , does the same thing at a slightly later time @xmath175 and takes the difference to obtain the observed phase shift for the infinitesimal evolution .",
    "this is equal to the sum of ( i ) change in the dynamical phase shift and ( ii ) the change in the geometric phase shift which is given by the appropriate areas swept on the sphere .",
    "integration of such phase shifts give the total phase shift for the finite evolution . in the second picture",
    "one constructs an effective time varying hamiltonian as seen by the beam at the point of interference and considers the phase shifts acquired by the final state for evolution under the effective hamiltonian .",
    "while the total phase shift obtained in the both the pictures is the same , the decomposition into the dynamical and the geometric parts is different .",
    "while the second picture is closer to the usual theoretical treatements , the first picture gives useful insights in cases where the evolution of the parameters in the main beam is cyclic .",
    "in such cases the dynamical phase shift @xmath176 for a full period of @xmath174 is equal to zero . in other words",
    "the nonmodular dynamical phase shift is a periodic function of @xmath177 and its global slope is equal to zero .",
    "the statements imply that when a beam of particles with @xmath9 internal states passes through an object which performs a sequence of @xmath178 transformations on the state , the total nonmodular dynamical phase acquired by the state is defined unambigously for every incident state and is independent of a reference state .",
    "it is thus an intrinsic property of the system . the nonmodular total phase shift and therefore the geometric part of the phase shift",
    "however need not integrate to zero over a period of @xmath174 and can equal @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an integer .",
    "these quantities therefore need not be periodic functions of @xmath177 . therefore , unlike the dynamical phase , the geometric phase acquired by the state is defined only modulo @xmath3 and can change by @xmath179 under cyclic evolutions of the system , the value of @xmath9 depending not only on the cycle of parameter changes but also on the reference state with respect to which the phase changes are measured . for two - state systems",
    "such changes are determined entirely by the appropriate areas swept on the sphere .",
    "we have presented an example demonstrating that the total phase shift over a cycle of a cyclic parameter is absolutely robust except at singular points in the parameter space where the nonmodular phase shift can make a sudden transition from one value of @xmath7 to another for a small change in parameter , i.e. can undergo a discrete jump in its global slope .",
    "the phase variations can be extremely sharp in the vicinity of these points .",
    "both the above mentioned properties namely robustness of the global slope of the topological phase shift and the possiblity of discrete transitions from one value of @xmath7 to another can form the basis of applications perhaps in the area of quantum information .",
    "an example of the first kind is the achromatic retarders developed by pancharatnam @xcite for polarized light .",
    "some examples of the second kind have been described in @xcite where it is shown that ( i ) an array of radio antennas phased using topological phase shifters can be made to look in two different directions at two different wavelengths at the same time and ( ii ) one can make a geometric phase lens which can switch from being convex to being concave with a change of wavelength of light passing through it .",
    "we also wish to note that while the focus in this paper is on unitary transformations , we expect the results to have suitable generalizations to nonunitary transformations .",
    "finally we point out an interesting extension of the pancharatnam phase criterion to partially polarized waves by sjqvist et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that phase singularities form an important part of the description in this case too .",
    "the author s attention has been drawn by one of the referees to a paper by berry @xcite that describes the theory of @xmath6 phase shifts arising from change in the number of dislocation lines threading an interferometer .",
    "this paper makes the very interesting observation that even the isotropic , polarization - independent phase shifts arising from a change in the optical path difference between two beams of an interferometer are topological in one sense .",
    "the considerations in @xcite however differ from those in the present paper and in our earlier work in the following respects . while in @xcite the interferometer configurations corresponding to the different values of @xmath7",
    "look physically different in that they enclose different number of dislocation lines , in the present paper and in our earlier work the @xmath6 phase shifts arising from cyclic variation of parameters in the interferometer beams leave the interferometer physically unchanged .",
    "secondly , while the singularities in berry s work reside in physical space , those in our work reside in the space of parameters of the unitary transformations that act on the internal degrees of freedom of the interfering particle , for example polarization in case of the photon .",
    "the relationship of our work with spatial singularities of the electromagnetic field can be further illustrated with the help of the following illustration .",
    "let @xmath152 be the propagation direction . at @xmath180 ,",
    "let a screen be placed normal to the beam which is a polarizer that passes the state @xmath11 . at @xmath181 , let an `` su(2 ) screen '' be placed which is such that at each point in the @xmath163 plane an element is placed which performs an su(2 ) transformation on the fields that pass through that point . at @xmath182 , let a third screen be placed which is a polarizer that passes the state @xmath24 .",
    "now let the amplitude and phase of the fields at each point in a plane normal to the beam at @xmath183 be examined .",
    "there will be points or lines at which the amplitude of the field will be zero .",
    "these are the singular points or lines .",
    "now let a phase detector be taken in a closed circuit around an isolated singular point .",
    "if the phase detector is such that it integrates phase shifts as it goes along , the total phase shift recorded in one such circuit will be equal to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the strength of the singularity .",
    "such an experiment is not very convenient to perform .",
    "what can easily be done however is to replace @xmath184 with two variable su(2 ) parameters in one of the beams of an interferometer such that variation of these parameters results in the same sequence of su(2 ) transformations on the polarization state as in the spatial example above .",
    "this is what is done in our experiments and the two are equivalent . while the spatial analogy presented above works only for two parameters , in our experiments one can in principle have more than two variable parameters .",
    "a good part of the work reported in this paper was done during the period the author was employed with the raman research institute , bangalore . library support from the institute after the author s retirement is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the algebraic definition for the noncyclic geometric phase introduced in @xcite can be found incorporated in a later , more formal treatment of the subject by mukunda and simon @xcite .",
    "we also refer the theoretically inclined reader to a paper by pati @xcite that deals with the geometric aspects of noncyclic quantum evolution ."
