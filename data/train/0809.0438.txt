    "in different optical systems phase noise and shot noise are usually considered as the main fundamental limiting factors of sensitivity .",
    "these noises determine the standard quantum limit of classical gravitational wave antennas @xcite . at the same time in laser systems coupled with high - finesse optical resonators fundamental frequency stability",
    "may be determined also by other fundamental effects connected with mechanical , thermodynamical and quantum @xcite properties of solid boundaries .",
    "many of these effects firstly identified and calculated on the forefront of laser gravitational wave antennas @xcite are becoming increasingly important in other high - q optical systems @xcite .",
    "excess optical phase noise is added to the wave reflected from the mirror of the optical cavity due to variation of boundary conditions produced by fluctuations of the surface and refractive index in the surface layer .",
    "* i. substrate brownian noise*. historically the first noise of this origin identified as a problem in gravitational wave antennas was thermal intrinsic noise produced by internal friction which may be related to the surface using fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "this noise is frequently noted as `` brownian motion '' or simply thermal noise .",
    "the spectral density of surface fluctuations of a mirror averaged over the gaussian beam radius @xmath0 ( determined at @xmath1 decay of intensity ) is the following : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is the temperature of the mirror , @xmath5 is the loss angle of the mirror substrate at a frequency @xmath6 of analysis , @xmath7 is the poisson ratio and @xmath8 is the young s modulus of the substrate .    *",
    "ii . coating brownian noise*. in the same way internal friction in the material of the coating produces additional fluctuations , which may be significantly stronger due to high level of acoustical losses in the material of the layers even though the thickness of this coating is relatively small .",
    "effective thermal noise associated with the coating is determined by the same relation ( [ sdbulk ] ) , with @xcite :    @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\phi_\\bot = y_\\bot\\langle \\phi / y\\rangle \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;    \\phi_\\vert=\\langle y\\phi\\rangle / y_\\vert \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; y_\\bot=\\langle 1/y\\rangle^{-1}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\nonumber\\\\    & & y_\\vert=\\langle y\\rangle\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\sigma_\\bot=\\langle \\sigma y\\rangle/\\langle y\\rangle    \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\sigma_\\vert\\simeq(\\sigma_l+\\sigma_h)/2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here and below averaging over the multilayer coating is performed as follows : @xmath10 indexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote constants for low and high reflection coating layers with thicknesses @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the total thickness of the coating with @xmath16 double layers .",

    "substrate thermoelastic noise*. in @xcite braginsky , gorodetsky and vyatchanin ( bgv ) suggested that temperature fluctuations in the bulk of the mirror transformed through thermal expansion to surface fluctuations should produce additional mechanical noise . using both the fdt approach and the langevin method for the analysis of thermal correlation functions analogous to that developed earlier by van vliet @xcite they have shown that this noise may be understood as the noise produced by thermoelastic damping .",

    "more general case for an arbitrary @xmath34 is analyzed in appendix a and discussed below .",
    "the existence of excess thermorefractive phase noise was earlier predicted @xcite and measured @xcite in optical fibers .",
    "this noise was also measured in high - q optical microspheres @xcite .    * vi .",
    "substrate photothermoelastic noise*. noise may be produced not only by intrinsic thermal fluctuations but also by fluctuation of absorbed power , heating the mirror @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is optical frequency and @xmath37 is spectral density of the absorbed power . for the case of shot noise in the absorbed power @xmath38 , single sided spectral density @xmath39 .",
    "more general case of arbitrary power fluctuations was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "* vii , viii coating photothermoelastic and photothermorefractive noises*. analogously to iv and v extrinsic thermal fluctuations produced by absorbed optical power should produce coating noise due to thermal expansion and fluctuations of the refractive index in the surface layers , with approximate estimates obtained in @xcite , which are verified in appendix b using bgv approach , where low frequency approximations for @xmath40 are also obtained : @xmath41",
    "@xmath42    * ix , x , xi substrate and coating stefan - boltzmann thermoradiation noises*. in all the above derivations stefan - boltzmann radiation from the surface was neglected considering that thermal conductivity dominates this process .",
    "however thermal radiation as a dissipative process produces additional fluctuations of temperature applied to the mirror .",
    "the spectral density of these temperature fluctuations obtained by van vliet is given in @xcite .",
    "as this noise is applied to the surface practically in the same way as photothermal noise , we can use expressions obtained in vi , vii , viii to estimate thermoradiation elastic noise in the substrate and in the coating and thermoradiation refractive noise by simple substitutions @xmath43    all the equations for the noises above are given or normalized for the case of infinite semi - space and adiabatic frequency range and show the ceiling of the noises in the range @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is thermal diffusivity ) .",
    "this range is mostly valid for the operating frequencies of ligo .",
    "corrections for higher and lower frequencies and finite size mirrors where needed , which could be essential for other applications with methods of accounting them for some cases may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all the noises numbered above are plotted on figure 1 for the parameters of ligo mirrors given in appendix e. it is clearly seen that currently only brownian and coating thermoelastic and thermorefractive noises are essential .",
    "it is appropriate to note however that the brownian noises are determined by the loss factor which is gradually improving with the development of technology and has not reached as it looks a fundamental shelf .",
    "this is especially true for the case of coating brownian noises where the loss factors in thin films are several order higher than in the bulk .",
    "it is quite possible that upcoming progress in the technology of dielectric film deposition can significantly improve the situation .",
    "it is worth to note in particularly recent significant improvement of tantala layers losses by addmixing of titanium oxide @xcite .",
    "another improvement is possible by using multilayer coating consisting with unequal layers and in particular generalized quarter - length layers where high - refractive layer has smaller and low refractive has larger optical thickness , preserving half a wavelength in the sum @xcite . as it is high - reflective material that has significantly higher losses and larger thermal expansion it becomes possible to lower brownian surface and thermoelastic noises optimizing relative thickness and compensating decreased reflectivity by additional layers @xcite .",
    "thermorefractive and thermoelastic noises unlike brownian noises are determined by basic constants of the material which could not be easily modified .",
    "these noises can become dominating at frequencies higher than 1 khz in projected ligo mirrors .",
    "one may notice that these two noises having the same order of magnitude and the same dependence from frequency and beam waist are produced by the same mechanism ",
    "temperature fluctuations as well as other pairs vii - viii and x - xi where these fluctuations of temperature are produced by external source or by surface radiation .",
    "surprisingly a natural question about correlation of these noises has not been explored so far .",
    "h.j.kimble recently proposed a magnificent idea @xcite , that surface fluctuations and refractive index change produced by strain could compensate each other in specially designed multilayer coating . in principle",
    "these strain produced fluctuations should be added to the `` noisy zoo '' , however strain fluctuations should be significantly suppressed near the free surface . as brownian fluctuations",
    "are currently the main limiting factor in ligo mirrors , the realization of this idea can radically improve the sensitivity .",
    "it is shown below that the same idea can be very easily applied to the surface noises produced by temperature fluctuations , namely to thermoelastic ( iv ) + thermorefractive ( v ) @xcite as well as pairs of photothermal ( vi+vii ) and thermoradiation ( x+xi ) noises .",
    "phase fluctuations produced by thermal refraction are equivalent to those produced by effective surface fluctuations @xmath46 .",
    "i have removed a confusing minus in the definition of @xmath29 as compared to bgv @xcite to have @xmath29 positive and have the same sign as @xmath47 , which is positive in most of optical materials ) .",
    "the effect of thermal refraction leads to lengthening of optical thickness @xmath48 and moves the effective surface from which the beam is reflected deeper in the mirror away in the direction of incoming beam . at the same time",
    "thermal expansion moves the surface of the mirror in the opposite direction toward the beam .",
    "this speculation and an observation that the value of thermorefractive and thermoelastic coating noises are close enough ( fig.1 ) gives hope that these two effects can compensate each other if some parameters of the coating are tweaked .",
    "the simplest model ( fig.2 ) can illustrate the effect of thermal noise compensation .",
    "let we have @xmath49 layers deposited on unmovable substrate and let the wave is reflected from the outermost layer only .",
    "the system of equations for the stationary amplitudes of circulating and reflected waves @xmath50 i use @xmath51 for a plain wave incident on the mirror , where @xmath52 is the wave number . with the reflection coefficient @xmath53",
    "the system has the following solution : @xmath54 now if due to the change of temperature the index of refraction and the length are changed @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , @xmath582k\\delta t\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one sees that though the last term in brackets is oscillating , its average linear dependence on @xmath34 allows to compensate the first term caused by thermal expansion by the thermal dependence of the refraction index with appropriate choice of the cover layer thickness .    in appendix",
    "a it is shown that the same situation is also valid for multilayer coating with varying outermost low - refractive layer . @xmath59",
    "the same type of expressions for limited number of layers and unequal layers are too bulky for practical purposes and it is easier to calculate them numerically by recurrent procedures .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] plots the dependence of absolute value of @xmath29 from the thickness of the covering layer .",
    "horizontal lines show the equivalent level of thermoelastic parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the crossings of the @xmath61-curve with horizontal @xmath62-lines provide the points of compensation ( at low frequencies ) .",
    "solid curves are calculated for the qwl coating with 21 layer , while dashed curves stand for optimized unequal 30 double layers with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , providing approximately the same low transmittivity @xmath65 .",
    "the dependence of transmittivity ( neglecting optical losses ) on the thickness of the topmost layer is shown in the bottom of fig.[fig3 ] . in most coating designs",
    "they choose the cap to have zero zero or @xmath66 ( protective cap ) thickness giving the best reflectivity , i.e. minimal transmittivity .",
    "however degradation of reflectivity can be more than compensated by one additional pair of deep layers if the noise issues are considered as more significant .",
    "it is possible to tweak simultaneously both high- and low - reflective top layers . as thermorefractive noise at @xmath33 is somewhat smaller than thermoelastic noise in a wide range of frequencies both for equal qwl and for layers with optimized thicknesses , noise compensation benefits from optimized levels in the same way as thermoelastic noise .",
    "noise cancellation can not be absolute .",
    "the effective volumes of thermorefractive and thermoelastic layers are significantly different as the wave is mostly reflected from a few outermost layers where the optical power decays exponentially and the thermal expansion is provided by the whole structure of the coating .",
    "the analysis of the level of possible compensation is given in appendix c.        the results of this analysis are shown on fig.[fig4 ] for the case of optimized layers ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and cover layer optimized for the frequencies of operation 10 , 100 and 1000 hz . for comparison thermorefractive noise in qwl layers leveled at thermoelastic noise is plotted .",
    "one can see that the proposed simple idea of suppression of thermorefractive and thermoelastic noises allows to lower their combined level up to 3 times in the vicinity of 100hz-1khz range .",
    "if the noise is compensated for zero frequency , the combined noise becomes frequency independent at low frequencies . at high frequencies ,",
    "when the length of thermal diffusion becomes comparable with the thickness of the coating , the spectral density of thermoelastic noise falls more rapidly than that of thermorefractive noise and compensation though at lower level becomes worse .",
    "roughly speaking , simple leveling of @xmath69 and @xmath70 parameters should work for low frequencies below 100 hz and qwl covering layer is close to optimal , while for higher frequencies very thin or half - wavelength covering layer , providing minimal @xmath29 is better .",
    "it is appropriate to note however , that the method of analysis used in appendix d becomes too approximate in this case and more accurate calculations are required for this case , which are forthcoming .",
    "it is instructive to look also whether it is possible to compensate with thermorefractive effect not only surface but substrate thermoelastic noise .",
    "the analysis is given in appendix d. it is shown that because of quite different effective working volumes of these effects the level of compensation is negligibly small for ligo mirrors ( @xmath71 ) , moreover in ligo the combined even compensated effect in the coating is still higher than the effect in the bulk for the operating frequencies , however this compensation may be essential in more traditional interferometers with significantly smaller beam waists .",
    "summing up the results of the presented analysis we see that the list of essential noises in high - reflection mirrors by simple tweaking of a multilayer coating may be noticeably shortened and we return to the situation of a decade ago when only brownian noise was considered .",
    "i am grateful to v.b.braginsky and s.p.vyatchanin for stimulating and encouraging discussions .",
    "let we have a multilayer coating , consisting of @xmath49 alternating layers ( or n double layers ) on a substrate , with the first being a cover layer and the substrate denoted by @xmath72 ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "the method of calculation of properties of a multilayer reflection coating is quite simple and computationally straightforward ( see for example @xcite ) , however not without pitfalls .",
    "though several analytical expressions are obtained below , for different practical applications it is usually more appropriate to do numerical anaysis .",
    "taking the dependence of forward and backward plane waves @xmath73 as @xmath74 , @xmath75 one introduces two values ",
    "amplitude coefficient of reflection @xmath76 and impedance @xmath77 , connected by the following equations : @xmath78",
    "as tangential components of electrical and magnetic fields are continuous on the boundary , the same is true for the impedance @xmath79 . from the other hand ,",
    "@xmath80 jumps on boundaries but change phase only in homogeneous media @xmath81 . in this way , starting from the rightmost layer , where in the substrate @xmath82 and @xmath83 , moving layer by layer from right to left , we can calculate @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85    the most frequently used type of multilayer coating is the one consisting of alternating high and low refractive quarter wave layers ( qwls ) with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "this type of coating produces the highest reflectivity for the given number of layers .",
    "it is easy to show that in this case @xmath90 . for two different cases 1 )",
    "when the cover layer @xmath91 is also a qwl  low refraction output layer , and without the cover layer ( @xmath33 , high refractive output layer ) one gets : @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "it is essential that when @xmath94 and @xmath95 both cases give @xmath96 but with different signs .",
    "when due to some homogeneous fluctuation in the mirror coating thicknesses and refractive index change , the output phase will also change . to calculate this phase fluctuation in a general case of arbitrary cover layer we use the model of infinite coating @xcite .",
    "let we have a multilayer coating with infinite number of alternating layers of optical thickness @xmath97 and @xmath98 and in some layer @xmath99 near its left boundary we have the reflectivity @xmath100 .",
    "now we add from the left two other layers @xmath101 and @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath102    as again we have the infinite number of the same type layers then @xmath103 and we can solve the system for the @xmath100 : @xmath104    we may find the solution of this equation for the generalized qwl layers with @xmath105 , @xmath106 .    substituting @xmath107 in ( [ gamma ] ) , we obtain the following equation : @xmath108 and after some manipulations we find : @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we add a cover layer with @xmath34 and @xmath91 and calculate @xmath84 : @xmath112    in particular case of vanilla qwl layers under homogeneous fluctuation of temperature @xmath113 we have : @xmath114    in principle we may take into account here also thermal expansion as @xmath115 , however in most of the materials used in multilayer coatings @xmath116 .",

    "@xmath121    this expression coincides with the one initially found by bgv in @xcite and disproves correction proposed in @xcite . recently this expression has been also confirmed by pinto @xcite .",
    "note that the expression for @xmath33 could not be simply obtained by indexes @xmath11 and @xmath12 reversal .",
    "the pitfall here is that these results belong to different branches of solution with @xmath122 , @xmath123 for the first low refraction layer and @xmath124 , @xmath125 for the first high refraction layer .    from the equation ( [ infinite ] )",

    "this expression coincides after substituting @xmath37 with that obtained in @xcite for @xmath144 . for practical purposes it is possible to match a simple numerical approximation for @xmath145 which has maximum error less than 5% for all @xmath146 : @xmath147    to calculate the thermoelastic effect of absorbed power in the layer @xmath148 one should at first solve for thermoelastic problem with the given fluctuating temperature to find surface fluctuations",
    "which should be averaged over the beam spot.this problem has been solved in @xcite ( a.15 ) for the langevin fluctuations : @xmath149 comparing this expression with ( [ ubar ] ) we see that boundary conditions on free surface produce more than doubled effect as compared to naive @xmath150 . hence we obtain @xmath151 this estimate is two times smaller ( for @xmath152 ) than that obtained in @xcite where also poisson correction is absent , however one should note that in real coating with very inhomogeneous initial temperature distribution over 3 - 4 layers and inhomogeneous @xmath62 and @xmath153 , coefficients may sufficiently differ from these rough approximations and from averaging adapted from surface thermoelastic calculations in @xcite high frequency limit of this approximation is reached at significantly lower frequencies , when @xmath154 , where the effect is transformed into the bulk photothermal effect of bgv @xcite in the effective layer material .",
