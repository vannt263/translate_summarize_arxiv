    "a conservation law ought to explain the change in some physical quantity contained inside a volume of space ( e.g. , total energy ) in terms of related fluxes passing through the bounding surface of that volume .",
    "the standard approach to constructing conservation laws is based on the identity : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath7 is a vector that determines the type of conservation law , viz . , energy , momentum , or angular momentum . in the context of general relativity ,",
    "matter energy - momentum is locally covariantly conserved , i.e. , @xmath8 , and the identity reduces to @xmath9 .",
    "as is well known , the problem with this local conservation law is that the right hand side is , in general , not zero ( or even a covariant divergence ) , resulting in a bulk term in the integrated conservation law that spoils what a conservation law ought to be .",
    "this problem is essentially gravitational in nature .",
    "there are several ways to see this : ( 1 ) the offending bulk term disappears when the spacetime has a suitable symmetry , i.e. , admits a killing vector , @xmath7 , but dynamically interesting spacetimes ( e.g. , ones containing gravitational effects due to objects in motion ) generically do not .",
    "the idea of relying on a spacetime symmetry to construct a conservation law is a throwback to pre - general relativity days , e.g. , special relativity , where spacetime is maximally symmetric .",
    "the same goes for relying on asymptotic spacetime symmetries , where we are still in essentially a special relativistic mindset .",
    "given that gravity _ is _ nontrivial spacetime geometry , an approach relying on spacetime symmetries can not hope to properly incorporate gravitational effects in general . ( 2 ) the local conservation law above is _ homogeneous _ in @xmath6 . in any matter - free region it is vacuous , even if that region contains interesting gravitational physics , e.g. , gravitational waves .",
    "the local conservation law is essentially blind to gravitational physics .",
    "we need a conservation law that is nontrivial even when @xmath10 .",
    "( 3 ) because of the equivalence principle , gravitational effects , e.g. , gravitational energy , are not localizable , so we have no hope of capturing gravitational physics with a conservation law based on a local stress - energy - momentum tensor . for example , there is no such thing as a local gravitational energy density ( energy per unit volume ) , that when integrated over a volume gives the total gravitational energy in that volume ( see , e.g. ,  20.4 of reference @xcite ) .",
    "( 4 ) a bulk term in a local conservation law can be a symptom of the presence of fields that are not being accounted for in the stress - energy - momentum tensor .",
    "for example , in the standard poynting theorem , the @xmath11 bulk term is present because @xmath6 excludes the charged matter field that is the source of the electromagnetic field , and represents an energy transfer mechanism between the electromagnetic field and the charged matter field .",
    "we contend that the bulk term in the local conservation law is , similarly , a result of @xmath6 not properly accounting for the physics of the gravitational field .    a solution to this problem is to move from local to _ quasi_local conservation laws , which _ can _ properly account for the gravitational physics . in this paper",
    "we construct a general quasilocal conservation law based not on the local _ matter",
    "_ stress - energy - momentum tensor , but on the brown and york quasilocal _ total _ stress - energy - momentum tensor ( matter _ plus _ gravity ) @xcite . here , ",
    "quasilocal \" means that the differential conservation law is integrated not over the history of a volume of space , but over the history of the _ boundary _ of that volume .",
    "we focus on the case of energy conservation , and show that in the quasilocal approach , the quasilocal analogue of the offending @xmath12 bulk term becomes a _ surface flux _",
    "term , which immediately solves the main problem mentioned in the opening paragraph above .",
    "moreover , this surface flux term has two components : ( i ) the first component is a  stress times strain \" term that can always be made to vanish by a suitable choice of frame , called a _",
    "rigid quasilocal frame _ ( or rqf ) @xcite",
    ". the reader need not be familiar with rqfs to read this paper ; it is sufficient to mention that , regarding point ( 1 ) in the previous paragraph , an rqf satisfies a certain  quasilocally projected \" form of the timelike killing vector condition for stationary spacetimes that allows us to move just far enough away from the spacetime symmetry mindset to include generic ( i.e. , non - stationary ) spacetimes in conservation laws for energy , momentum , and angular momentum .",
    "( ii ) the second component is an  acceleration times momentum \" term .",
    "this term is familiar from classical mechanics , and represents the rate at which the kinetic energy of an object increases due to one s acceleration toward it . motivated by a simple equivalence principle argument , we show that this second term is actually a _ gravitational _ energy flux involving the general relativistic effect of frame dragging .",
    "we thus show precisely how quasilocal conservation laws resolve the bulk term problem in local conservation laws by properly accounting for the physics of the gravitational field .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ paradox ] we introduce a very simple example of energy conservation in the context of special relativity , for the purpose of having a concrete example with which to illustrate the development of the general ideas .",
    "we consider a variant of bell s spaceship paradox in which a box accelerates rigidly in a transverse , uniform electric field . obviously , the electromagnetic energy inside the box increases , but how would co - moving observers explain this increase ? paradoxically , only _",
    "half _ of the increasing energy comes from a net poynting flux , and , according to the local energy conservation law , the other half comes from a bulk  acceleration times momentum \" term integrated over the volume of the box . in  [ local ]",
    "we examine local conservation laws in general , with a particular focus on the role played by the @xmath12 bulk term in our paradox example .",
    "this provides a point of comparison for  [ quasilocal ] , in which we construct a general quasilocal conservation law and argue how it properly accounts for gravitational physics .",
    "we also apply the energy form of this quasilocal conservation law to the general relativistic version of our paradox example to concretely illustrate how , what we would normally think of as a bulk  acceleration times momentum \" term , is actually a gravitational energy flux entering through the boundary of the box . in  [ conclusions ] we present a complementary summary and conclusions , and argue that quasilocal conservation laws are necessary to understand more deeply a wide variety of phenomena , including the simple example of dropping an apple .",
    "[ trajectory ]    consider a right cylinder of length @xmath13 and cross - sectional area @xmath14 , whose axis is parallel to the @xmath15-axis of an inertial reference frame in flat spacetime with minkowski coordinates @xmath16 . the cylinder is immersed in a constant , uniform electric field of magnitude @xmath17 in the positive @xmath18-direction , and thus contains an electromagnetic energy density equal to @xmath19 .",
    "now let us give the cylinder constant proper acceleration in the positive @xmath15-direction so that the length ( and volume ) of the cylinder remain fixed for co - moving observers .",
    "it is well - known from bell s spaceship paradox that , in order for the length of the cylinder to remain constant for co - moving observers , the top of the cylinder ( represented by the hyperbola on the right in the diagram ) must experience _",
    "less _ proper acceleration , namely @xmath20 , compared to @xmath21 , the proper acceleration experienced at the bottom of the cylinder ( the hyperbola on the left ) @xcite .",
    "the following two facts , also illustrated in the diagram , will be important to us : ( 1 ) the straight lines passing through the origin represent a natural choice for the surfaces of simultaneity for the co - moving observers : on any such simultaneity , all of the accelerating co - moving observers see the _ same _ instantaneous velocity , @xmath22 , relative to observers at rest in the inertial frame . in other words , this is a ",
    "constant @xmath22 \" time foliation , with @xmath22 monotonically increasing with time . ( 2 ) co - moving observers at different positions along the length of the cylinder will see proper time flowing at different rates relative to one another . that is , between two co - moving simultaneities , if a proper time @xmath23 elapses for an observer at the bottom of the cylinder , a _ greater _ proper time , @xmath24 elapses for an observer at the top .    with these facts in mind",
    ", let us consider the proper electric and magnetic fields seen by the co - moving observers .",
    "let @xmath25 ( respectively , @xmath26 ) denote the proper time of observers at the bottom ( respectively , top ) of the cylinder , and @xmath27 denote the natural choice of co - moving spatial cartesian unit vectors .",
    "since the observers are moving in a direction perpendicular to the electric field , they will see , in addition to a stronger electric field , a magnetic field ; specifically , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to note that since these fields depend only on @xmath22 , all observers on any given co - moving simultaneity will see the _ same _ instantaneous electric and magnetic fields .",
    "they will thus see the _ same _ proper poynting vector , @xmath32 , and the _ same _ proper electromagnetic energy density , @xmath33 .",
    "notice that , according to this expression for @xmath34 , the total electromagnetic energy inside the cylinder is clearly increasing with time .",
    "we ask : how would the co - moving observers explain this increasing electromagnetic energy ?",
    "one might expect that the change in energy between two co - moving simultaneities is just equal to the net poynting flux into the cylinder over that time interval .",
    "as we will see , this is only half correct .",
    "consider a pair of infinitesimally separated co - moving simultaneities labeled by proper time @xmath25 and @xmath35 as experienced by observers at the bottom of the cylinder .",
    "( a bit of thought shows that it does not matter whose proper time we use to parameterize the simultaneities . ) between these two simultaneities the total electromagnetic energy inside the cylinder changes by an amount @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the volume of the cylinder ( which is constant for the co - moving observers ) . in this calculation",
    "we have made use of the relation @xmath38 for an observer at the bottom of the cylinder , who is experiencing constant proper acceleration @xmath21 .",
    "naively , we ought to be able to arrive at the same result by considering the net poynting flux crossing the boundary of the cylinder .",
    "before we calculate this , it is interesting to understand the mechanism by which the poynting vector carries energy into the cylinder .",
    "as noted earlier , on any given co - moving simultaneity the relative velocity , @xmath22 , is constant along the cylinder and , thus , the proper poynting vector is the same at the top and bottom of the cylinder .",
    "since no flux leaves or enters the sides of the cylinder , this suggests that the net poynting flux is zero .",
    "recall , however , that because of the acceleration , proper time advances more quickly at the top of the cylinder relative to the bottom .",
    "this results in a greater proper time - integrated flux entering the top of the cylinder compared to that leaving the bottom of the cylinder  in other words , a net accumulation of electromagnetic energy .",
    "net electromagnetic energy enters the cylinder because of the time dilation effect associated with the acceleration . with the magnitude of the poynting vector given above , we find @xmath39 observe that the net poynting flux , equation ( [ e(2 ) ] ) , accounts for only _ half _ of the change in electromagnetic energy inside the cylinder , equation ( [ e(1 ) ] ) .",
    "apparently , we have a paradox .      to understand the missing piece of this puzzle , let us first consider a simple problem in classical mechanics .",
    "imagine an object with rest mass @xmath40 from the point of view of a reference frame moving towards it with instantaneous speed @xmath22 .",
    "in this reference frame , we would consider the object to have total energy @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the object s instantaneous momentum relative to the frame . now ,",
    "if our frame is accelerating at a proper rate @xmath21 , it is easy to show that , in a proper time @xmath43 , the object s total energy changes by an amount @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the total energy of the object increases solely as a result of the acceleration of our frame relative to the object .",
    "the resolution to the paradox follows the same line of reasoning : as the cylinder accelerates relative to the existing momentum inside , there is an increase in energy proportional to this momentum times the acceleration .",
    "the momentum in this case belongs to the electromagnetic field contained in the cylinder , and is proportional to the poynting vector : @xmath45 ( as a consistency check , observe that as the electromagnetic energy , @xmath46 , inside the cylinder increases , so does the electromagnetic momentum , @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 times the invariant mass , @xmath49 remains constant , as expected , and equal to the electromagnetic energy inside the cylinder when @xmath50 . )    now , for the problem at hand , the contribution to the energy change due to this effect is just @xmath51 notice that this energy change combined with the accumulation of poynting flux due to the acceleration - induced time dilation along the length of the cylinder , @xmath52 , now precisely matches that calculated from the energy density , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "thus we have found the missing piece of the puzzle in the apparent paradox .",
    "it is not sufficient to consider the change in energy inside the cylinder based solely on the accumulation of poynting flux across the surface ; one must also take into account a  momentum times acceleration \" term due to the frame accelerating relative to an existing momentum .",
    "the inclusion of this _ bulk _",
    "term then resolves the apparent paradox but comes with a cost  it does away with the usual _  change in energy equals net energy flux through the boundary \" _ picture of a conservation law .",
    "let us now look more generally at the notion of conservation laws in the context of both special and general relativity .",
    "consider a smooth four - dimensional manifold , @xmath54 , endowed with a lorentzian spacetime metric , @xmath55 , and associated covariant derivative operator , @xmath56 . in the presence of a non - zero matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath6 , we can construct the identity @xmath57 this identity gives a differential conservation law for the current @xmath58 , whose physical interpretation depends on the choice of the weighting vector , @xmath7 . integrating both sides of this identity over a finite four - volume , @xmath59 , we have @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the left hand side , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the initial and final three - dimensional spatial volume  end caps \" of @xmath59 , with timelike future - directed unit normal vector @xmath63 . on the right hand side , @xmath64 is a three - dimensional timelike worldtube spanning the boundaries of the end caps , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with spacelike outward - directed unit normal vector , @xmath67 , and induced lorentzian three - metric @xmath68 .    in general",
    ", the left hand side of equation  ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) gives the change in a quantity contained inside a spatial volume ( e.g. , electromagnetic energy ) over some time interval , while the first term on the right hand side corresponds to matter fluxes across the boundary of that spatial volume during that time interval ( e.g. , electromagnetic poynting flux ) .",
    "this is the desired form of a conservation law .",
    "however , there are two additional terms on the right hand side that are four - dimensional bulk integrals .",
    "the first of these involves @xmath69 , which is zero in general relativity ; however in special relativity it will in general not vanish when @xmath6 does not include all of the matter fields ( e.g. , when it does not include the electric four - current source of an electromagnetic field ) .",
    "the second term is present when @xmath7 is not a killing vector and , as it turns out , is crucial in resolving the apparent paradox above . to gain a better understanding of the terms in equation  ( [ bulkintegrated ] )",

    "when @xmath71 is _ not _ a killing vector , however , these two bulk terms provide additional mechanisms for energy transfer .",
    "the @xmath90 term represents change in energy due to the frame accelerating relative to an existing electromagnetic momentum in the system ( as was seen in resolving the apparent paradox of  [ paradox ] ) .",
    "the @xmath91 term represents the maxwell stress , @xmath92 , doing work against the strain , @xmath93 , of the three - parameter congruence .",

    "] moreover , to facilitate comparison with the general relativistic calculation in the next section ( on _ quasi_local conservation laws ) , we will switch from a right circular cylinder of length @xmath13 and cross - sectional area @xmath14 to a round sphere of areal radius @xmath94 .",
    "the reason for this switch is that the general relativistic calculation involves the extrinsic curvature of the boundary of our spatial volume , and the sharp corners of a cylinder introduce an unnecessary technical complication .",
    "let us denote the minkowski coordinates of an inertial reference frame in flat spacetime by @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",

    "a short calculation reveals that the metric in the observer - adapted coordinate system is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the metric on the unit round sphere , and @xmath114 is the lapse function .",
    "the observers four - velocity is defined as @xmath115 , with resulting four - acceleration @xmath116 . comparing with the discussion of the paradox given in ",
    "[ paradox ] , in the context of an accelerating cylinder , the nontrivial lapse function , @xmath117 , is the analogue of our earlier relation @xmath24 , i.e. , when @xmath118 , proper time passes more quickly for observers above the plane @xmath119 relative to those below it . also , the magnitude of the observers proper acceleration , @xmath120 , is the analogue of our earlier relation @xmath20 , i.e. , when @xmath118 , observers above the plane @xmath119 experience less proper acceleration compared to those below it . finally , by inspection of the metric in equation ( [ adaptedcoordmetric ] ) , it is clear that the observers are accelerating _ rigidly _ , in the sense that the orthogonal distance between all nearest neighbor pairs of observers remains constant in time , as in the bell spaceship paradox ( despite the time - dependent acceleration ) .",
    "thus , the three - dimensional strain rate tensor , @xmath93 in equation  ( [ bulktransfer2 ] ) , is zero .",

    "it follows from equation ( [ emstresstensor ] ) that the electromagnetic stress - energy - momentum tensor is @xmath123 .",
    "choosing @xmath80 in equation ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) makes this an energy conservation equation . with @xmath124 and @xmath125",

    "note also that we have used @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the area element on the unit round sphere .    in order to compare directly with the results in  [ paradox ] ,",
    "let the time interval be infinitesimal : @xmath136 .",
    "using the relation @xmath137 , the left hand side of equation  ( [ paradoxconservationlaw ] ) then integrates to precisely the same change in electromagnetic energy , @xmath138 , given in equation  ( [ e(1 ) ] ) , except with the cylinder volume , @xmath37 , replaced with the sphere volume , @xmath139 .",
    "also , the @xmath23 in the equation now refers to the proper time elapsed for the observer at the center of the sphere , instead of an observer at the bottom of the cylinder .",

    "however , the nontrivial lapse function is responsible for a @xmath142 term that does _ not _ integrate to zero . as in  [ paradox ] , it is this non - isotropic time dilation that allows for a nonzero accumulation of poynting flux . evaluating this integral we find precisely the same change in electromagnetic energy , @xmath52 , given in equation  ( [ e(2 ) ] ) , except with @xmath143 and @xmath23 reinterpreted as discussed above .",
    "finally , the bulk integral over @xmath59 on the right hand side of equation  ( [ paradoxconservationlaw ] ) , which measures the change in energy due to the acceleration of the frame relative to the existing electromagnetic momentum in the system , evaluates to precisely the same change in electromagnetic energy , @xmath144 , given in equation  ( [ e(3 ) ] ) , except with @xmath143 and @xmath23 again reinterpreted as discussed above .",
    "this example illustrates that any local conservation law constructed from the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath6 , as in equations  ( [ bulkdifferential ] ) and ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) , in general contains _ two _ terms responsible for the change in a physical quantity inside a volume of space : the first is a three - dimensional surface flux integral over @xmath145 , as one might expect , and the second is a four - dimensional bulk integral over @xmath146 .",
    "it is the addition of this bulk integral , which naively we did not expect , that resolves the apparent paradox introduced in  [ paradox ] .",
    "but is such a bulk integral really necessary ? in the next section",
    "we will see how to naturally convert this bulk integral into a surface flux integral , and at the same time generalize the conservation law in equations  ( [ bulkdifferential ] ) and ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) to include gravitational effects .",
    "we will now argue that the local conservation law given in equations  ( [ bulkdifferential ] ) and ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) is defective in two respects .",
    "first , even when matter is locally covariantly conserved , i.e. , @xmath8 ( which is always true in general relativity ) , the local conservation law contains a nontrivial bulk term when @xmath6 is present and @xmath7 is not a killing vector . insofar as a generic spacetime does not admit any killing vectors , when @xmath6 is present this bulk term is generically present .",
    "but this bulk term violates what we usually think of as a conservation law , i.e. , that the change in some physical quantity over a period of time is equal to some related surface flux integral over that period of time .",
    "is there a natural and general way to convert this bulk term into a surface flux term ?    to help motivate this question ,",
    "let us return for a moment to the  momentum times acceleration \" bulk term that resolves the apparent paradox introduced in  [ paradox ] .",
    "we imagine being inside an accelerating box in flat spacetime that contains a freely - floating , massive object that appears to be accelerating toward us ; the object s kinetic energy ( relative to us ) increases due to the acceleration of our frame . we ask :",
    "where does the increasing kinetic energy come from ?",
    "this might sound like a silly question  after all , energy is frame - dependent , and we are just changing the frame ! however , the question is perhaps not so silly when we ask it in the context of the equivalence principle . instead of being inside an accelerating box",
    ", we could imagine that the box is at rest in a uniform gravitational field , and that the object is experiencing an acceleration toward us due to the  force \" of gravity .",
    "this  force \" acting through a distance represents an energy transfer mechanism from the gravitational field energy to the kinetic energy of the object .",
    "so it might be possible to convert the  momentum times acceleration \" bulk term into some kind of surface flux term representing _ gravitational _ energy entering the box from the outside . in the context of general relativity ,",
    "i.e. , when we properly account for the frame dragging produced by the object in motion , we will see that this is exactly what happens .",
    "the second defect , which is related to the first , is that the local conservation law given in equations  ( [ bulkdifferential ] ) and ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) can not properly account for gravitational effects since it is _ homogeneous _ in @xmath6 . in any vacuum spacetime region where @xmath10 , the local conservation law has nothing to say .",
    "for example , we can imagine a vacuum region of space containing gravitational energy that is flowing in or out , to which the local conservation law is completely blind .",
    "this is , of course , to be expected , given that gravitational energy is not localizable .",
    "it seems that we need a term _ like _ @xmath147 , which can be thought of as a measure of the presence of interesting gravitational physics , e.g. , a non - stationary spacetime , and that this term should be coupled not to @xmath6 , but rather some kind of _ quasi_local stress - energy - momentum tensor that represents both matter _ and _ gravity , so that it can be nonzero even when @xmath10 .",
    "we will presently construct a general quasilocal conservation law with precisely these properties , that will remove this second defect and , by its very construction , will also automatically remove the first defect , in an interesting and subtle way , exactly as anticipated in the previous paragraph .",
    "let us consider an identity exactly analogous to equation ( [ bulkdifferential ] ) , except defined in the _",
    "three_-dimensional spacetime of the timelike worldtube , @xmath64 , i.e. , the history of the boundary of a three - dimensional system .",

    "it is interesting to compare this quasilocal conservation law to the local conservation law in equation ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) .",
    "the left hand side of both equations gives the change in a physical quantity ( e.g. , energy ) contained in a spatial three - volume .",
    "the first key difference is that the left hand side of equation ( [ quasilocalintegrated ] ) is _ quasilocal _ : it is an integral of a _ surface _",
    "density ( e.g. , energy per unit area ) over the two - surface boundary of the three - volume . unlike the local volume density ,",

    "the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ quasilocalintegrated])the matter flux term  is identical to that in equation ( [ bulkintegrated ] ) ( when @xmath167 is tangent to @xmath64 ) , except its origin is very different . unlike equation ( [ bulkdifferential ] ) , equation ( [ quasilocaldifferential ] ) is purely geometrical , involving only the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of @xmath64 , with no reference to matter .",

    "the structure of equation  ( [ quasilocaltransfer ] ) is identical to that of equation  ( [ bulktransfer2 ] ) , except it is one dimension lower : surface , rather than volume , i.e. , quasilocal , rather than local . by the very construction of the quasilocal conservation law ,",
    "the volume densities @xmath90 and @xmath179 in equation  ( [ bulktransfer2 ] ) automatically become surface densities , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively , i.e. , surface fluxes .",
    "this removes the first defect of local conservation laws discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "let us first focus on the quasilocal  momentum times acceleration \" term , @xmath180 .",
    "unlike the momentum volume density , @xmath182 , the momentum surface density , @xmath183 , is purely geometrical : it is a component of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath64 closely related to a vector , @xmath184 , that measures the precession rate of the observers local  radial \" vector , @xmath161 , relative to inertial gyroscopes . as shown in more detail in reference @xcite ,",
    "the precise relation is : @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the two - dimensional spatial volume form orthogonal to both @xmath71 and @xmath161 .",
    "this allows us to write : @xmath187 which is reminiscent of the normal component of the electromagnetic poynting vector , @xmath188 .",
    "in fact , as we argue in more detail in reference @xcite , we believe that @xmath180 is the exact , purely geometrical , operational expression for gravitational energy flux .",
    "so the  momentum times acceleration \" bulk term , @xmath90 , has really become a gravitational energy surface flux term , exactly as anticipated in the equivalence principle argument given near the beginning of this section . in the context of general relativity , the presence of momentum ( matter or gravitational ) flowing through the system causes the observers local  radial \" vector to precess relative to inertial gyroscopes ( i.e. , a frame dragging effect ) , and the vector cross product between this precession rate ( the gravitational analogue of a magnetic field ) and the observers acceleration ( the gravitational analogue of an electric field ) corresponds to a flow of gravitational energy into the system .",
    "of course this frame dragging mechanism of energy transfer would be difficult to confirm experimentally because the frame dragging precession rate is smaller than the momentum density by the factor @xmath189 .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of this mechanism is not surprising given that it bears a close resemblance to a similar mechanism in electrodynamics . in the context of special relativity , consider a charged particle accelerating in a uniform electric field ( for simplicity we will ignore radiation reaction , which does nt affect the point of our discussion ) .",
    "we ask : where does the particle s increasing kinetic energy come from ?",
    "the answer is obviously  the field . \" but what is the mechanism , exactly ?",
    "consider that the velocity field part of the magnetic field due to the particle s motion is localized near the particle , and circulates around its axis of motion .",
    "a moment s thought shows that the vector cross product between the external electric field ( causing the particle s acceleration ) and this magnetic velocity field ( moving with the particle ) points toward the axis of motion , and is maximum in the plane containing the particle . in other words , there is a poynting vector representing a flow of energy from the field to the particle .",
    "intuitively , one might guess that this answers our question .",
    "surprisingly , it seems that a detailed analysis of this basic energy transfer mechanism in classical electrodynamics has been done only very recently @xcite .",
    "the authors of this reference verify that our intuition is correct , at least in the ultra - relativistic limit . of the particle s kinetic energy",
    "is supplied by the poynting flux ; @xmath190 is supplied by a peculiar  interference \" effect between the external electric field and the velocity field part of the particle s electric field @xcite .",
    "this subtlety is interesting , but it does not affect the spirit of our discussion . ]    to the extent that the linearized approximation to general relativity is very similar to electrodynamics , one might expect essentially the same energy transfer mechanism to occur in gravitational physics , when , e.g. , we replace the massive , charged particle accelerating in a uniform electric field with a massive ( charged or uncharged ) particle accelerating in a uniform gravitational field ( or , via the equivalence principle , a frame accelerating toward a freely - floating particle ) . in the context of the linearized , slow motion approximation to general relativity , sometimes called _ gravitoelectromagnetism _ ( for a review , see @xcite ) , precisely such a mechanism has been confirmed ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "what s new in this paper is that this frame dragging energy transfer mechanism is confirmed in the full , nonlinear general theory of relativity with arbitrary matter and with no approximations ; the gravitational energy flux , @xmath180 , is an exact , purely geometrical contribution to the energy flux that must be considered to properly explain a wide variety of phenomena , including phenomena as basic as a falling apple .",
    "we will compute an explicit example of this energy transfer mechanism in the next section .",
    "let us now focus on the quasilocal  stress times strain \" term , @xmath181 , in equation  ( [ quasilocaltransfer ] ) .",
    "the boundary observers strain rate tensor , @xmath191 , is the two - dimensional analogue of the three - dimensional strain rate tensor , @xmath93 , in equation  ( [ bulktransfer2 ] ) , for a volume - filling set of observers . in the latter case , it is obvious that such a _",
    "three_-parameter family of observers can not , in general , move _ rigidly _",
    ", i.e. , move in such a way as to maintain constant radar - ranging distances between all nearest neighbor pairs of observers .",
    "this is because the condition @xmath192 represents six differential constraints on three functions ( the three independent components of the observers four - velocity , @xmath71 ) . in other words",
    ", the local conservation law generically contains a nontrivial bulk ",
    "stress times strain \" term , @xmath179 .",
    "the same is _ not _ true for a _",
    "two_-parameter family of observers , because there the condition @xmath193 represents only _ three _ differential constraints on the same three functions .",
    "in reference @xcite we argue that , in a generic spacetime , it is always possible to find a two - parameter congruence of integral curves of @xmath71 , comprising @xmath64 , that is expansion- and shear - free .",
    "moreover , the degrees of freedom of motion left to such a congruence of boundary observers are precisely the same as those for rigid body motion in newtonian space - time , viz .",
    ", three translations and three rotations , each with arbitrary time dependence . in other words , in the quasilocal conservation law ( but _ not _ in the local conservation law ) , it is always possible to choose a family of observers such that the  stress times strain \" term vanishes .",
    "we have called such a family of observers a _ rigid quasilocal frame _ , or rqf for short .",
    "we refer the reader to references @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the properties of rqfs . for our present purposes we need only appreciate that , since a congruence of rqf observers is expansion- and shear - free , there are no extraneous fluxes entering or leaving the system due merely to a change in the size or shape of the system boundary .",
    "so all of the interesting physics lies in the @xmath180 surface flux term discussed above .",
    "this is a key advantage to working with a quasilocal conservation law in general , and rqfs in particular .",
    "we will compute an explicit example of an rqf in the next section .    in summary ,",
    "the quasilocal conservation law introduced in this section removes two defects of the familiar local conservation law : ( 1 ) the undesirable bulk terms in the local conservation law automatically appear as surface flux terms in the quasilocal conservation law , and ( 2 ) unlike the local conservation law , the quasilocal conservation law accounts for gravitational effects .",
    "for example , the quasilocal energy conservation law contains an energy transfer mechanism related to frame dragging that is needed to understand in detail what is actually happening with regards to energy flow when , say , an apple falls . in the next section",
    "we will apply the quasilocal energy conservation law to a general relativistic analogue of the apparent paradox introduced in  [ paradox ] .      to illustrate the explanatory power of the quasilocal approach",
    "let us now look at a general relativistic analogue of the apparent paradox introduced in  [ paradox ] .",
    "we will work with a spacetime whose metric is @xmath55 in coordinates @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and which contains a covariantly constant ( i.e. , uniform ) electric field of magnitude @xmath17 in the positive @xmath18-direction @xcite : @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the length scale of the geometry .",
    "it is important to note that the presence of the electric field is intimately connected to the spacetime curvature  we are no longer working in flat spacetime .",
    "this is readily verified by checking that there exist non - zero curvature invariants such as @xmath196 .",
    "alternatively , it is easy to see that this spacetime is a product of two surfaces of constant curvature @xcite .",
    "observe that @xmath55 reduces to the minkowski metric in the @xmath197 plane .",
    "in this plane let us construct a timelike worldline , @xmath198 , parameterized by proper time , @xmath25 , and defined by the embedding @xmath199 , that represents a fiducial observer undergoing proper acceleration @xmath108 along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "as in  [ local ] , along @xmath198 we define a tetrad , @xmath107 and @xmath106 , where @xmath200 denotes the unit vector tangent to @xmath198 , and the spatial triad , @xmath106 , is fermi - walker transported along @xmath198 . because @xmath55 equals the minkowski metric on @xmath201 , we can use the same coordinate components for this tetrad as given in equations  ( [ tetrad_0])-([tetrad_3 ] ) .",
    "around @xmath201 we will construct a two - parameter family ( two - sphere s worth ) of accelerated observers , whose congruence of worldlines comprises a timelike worldtube , @xmath140 .",

    "this problem is to notice that the standard local conservation law is _ homogeneous _ in the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , and so has nothing to say in a matter - free region of space , even though that region may contain dynamical curvature , e.g. , gravitational waves .    to address these shortcomings in general , and",

    "the first mechanism is identical in form to the poynting flux mechanism described above [ number ( 1 ) ] , but conceptually it has a completely different origin : it is actually analogous to a surface flux version of the @xmath11 bulk term in the standard poynting theorem , except instead of energy being transferred locally from the electromagnetic field to the four - current source of the field , it represents energy being transferred quasilocally from the matter fields to the  system \" contained inside the box .",
    "the second mechanism is , at first sight , conceptually identical to the  acceleration times momentum \" energy transfer mechanism described above [ number ( 2 ) ] , except the volume integral has been converted to a _ surface flux _ integral over the boundary of the box .",
    "going further , we argued that this surface flux is actually a _ gravitational _ energy flux exactly analogous to the electromagnetic poynting flux , @xmath243 , with @xmath244 replaced by the acceleration of the co - moving observers on the boundary of the box , and @xmath245 replaced by the precession rate of their gyroscopes due to the frame dragging caused by the electromagnetic momentum ( in general , matter and gravitational momentum ) flowing through the box . in _ both _ cases , now , energy is entering from outside the box via surface fluxes : half is an electromagnetic energy flux ( entering the box through its top and bottom ) and the other half is a gravitational energy flux ( entering the box through its _ sides _ ) . because an electromagnetic field is intimately intertwined with the spacetime curvature it produces , general relativity does not distinguish between electromagnetic and gravitational energy entering the box  both contribute on the same footing to the increasing electromagnetic energy inside the box .",
    "we can understand the second , gravitational energy flux mechanism intuitively as follows .",

    "<S> we argue that conservation laws based on the _ local _ matter - only stress - energy - momentum tensor ( characterized by energy and momentum per unit _ volume _ ) can not adequately explain a wide variety of even very simple physical phenomena because they fail to properly account for gravitational effects . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a general _ quasi_local conservation law based on the brown and york _ total _ ( matter _ plus _ gravity ) stress - energy - momentum tensor ( characterized by energy and momentum per unit _ area _ ) , and argue that it _ does _ properly account for gravitational effects . as a simple example of the explanatory power of this quasilocal approach , consider that , when we accelerate toward a freely - floating massive object , the kinetic energy of that object increases ( relative to our frame ) . but how , exactly , does the object acquire this increasing kinetic energy ? using the energy form of our quasilocal conservation law , we can see precisely the actual mechanism by which the kinetic energy increases : it is due to a bona fide gravitational energy flux that is exactly analogous to the electromagnetic poynting flux , and involves the general relativistic effect of frame dragging caused by the object s motion relative to us .    * quasilocal conservation laws : why we need them *    paul l. mcgrath@xmath0 , richard j. epp@xmath1 and robert b. mann@xmath2    @xmath3 _ department of physics and astronomy , university of waterloo , waterloo , ontario n2l 3g1 , canada _    @xmath4 _ perimeter institute for theoretical physics , waterloo , ontario n2l 2y5 , canada _    _ </S>",
