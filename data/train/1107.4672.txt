    "the structure of the qcd phase diagram is intimately related to our understanding of fundamental features of qcd , like for example confinement dynamics and chiral symmetry breaking , and to their interplay with in - medium effects like a nonzero temperature or quark density .",

    "moreover , gauge transformations belonging to the center of the gauge algebra only cause @xmath15 to be multiplied by an overall factor . that is why it has been conjectured that the confinement / deconfinement phase transition in a yang - mills theory with gauge algebra @xmath16 might be related to the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry related to the center of @xmath16  @xcite . in the particular case of su(@xmath1 ) , deconfinement might thus be driven by the breaking of a global z@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition should then be the traced polyakov loop @xmath17 where the trace @xmath18 is taken over the colour indices .",

    "effective  polyakov - loop - based \" approaches have proven to be a relevant tool in view of modelling the thermodynamic properties of pure gauge qcd .",
    "the traced polyakov loop is then the order parameter associated to confinement , itself seen as correlated with a global center symmetry , z@xmath0 when the gauge group is su(@xmath1 ) . following a suggestion made in  @xcite , an explicitly z@xmath0-symmetric potential involving the traced polyakov loop has been built and leads to : a first - order phase transition at large-@xmath1 , a gluonic pressure scaling as @xmath154 , and an @xmath1-independent optimal value for the polyakov loop .",
    "the coupling of the pure gauge sector to light quarks has then been performed within a pnjl approach .",
    "thanks to a particular ansatz for the polyakov loop , the quark potential is such that it only involves the traced polyakov loop that appears in the pure gauge potential .",
    "it has to be said that the resulting pnjl model is designed to be relevant in the large-@xmath1 limit only .",
    "it is moreover inequivalent to the model proposed in  @xcite since the colour traces that have to be performed in the derivation of the pnjl potential are carried differently .",
    "the different assumptions that were made lead to a large-@xmath1 phase diagram that compares favourably with previous approaches . at any @xmath4",
    ", it shows a deconfined , chirally symmetric , phase above the deconfinement temperature ( @xmath155270  mev ) .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition and the restoration of chiral symmetry are found to be simultaneous first - order phase transitions , in agreement with  @xcite . at temperatures lower than @xmath3 ,",
    "thus in the confined phase , there is a critical line @xmath6 separating a phase with broken chiral symmetry at small @xmath4 and a chirally symmetric phase at large @xmath4 .",
    "the phase transition is found to be a crossover from the triple point ( 0.212 , 0.270 )  gev to the critical - end - point ( 0.335 , 0.063 )  gev .",
    "it is then of first order until the boundary ( 0.343 , 0 )  gev is reached , corresponding to the estimate @xmath156  @xcite .",
    "it is worth saying that a confined , chirally symmetric , phase has also been found by solving schwinger - dyson equations at nonzero @xmath4 in  @xcite , and that evidences for the existence of such a phase has been found in coulomb gauge qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "the present model s prediction of three different phases , among which a chirally symmetric phase at baryonic chemical potentials around the nucleon mass thus seems a reliable one .",
    "the structure of the critical lines appears however to depend quite strongly on the way the polyakov loop @xmath23 is handled : the comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig6 ] shows how a different treatment of the polyakov loop within similar pnjl - based approaches can affect the phase diagram .",
    "it is also worth noting that an accurate description of the confined but chirally symmetric ",
    "quarkyonic at large @xmath1  phase would require a more detailed approach that the simple pnjl model presented here .",
    "in particular , the explicit inclusion of baryonic degrees of freedom should be performed , but this is a task that we leave for subsequent studies .",
    "a first interesting attempt has for example been made in @xcite , where a constituent approach is used to model the baryonic matter at large @xmath1 .",
    "recently , an effective model has been proposed @xcite , in which the lagrangian involves a linear sigma model for the quark part and a dilaton - like effective potential for the gluon part . such a dilaton - like potential is designed to mimic the breaking of scale invariance through a nonzero value of the gluon condensate ( the dilaton field ) .",
    "the phase diagram which is found is nearly identical to the one of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , excepted that the deconfinement phase transition is replaced by a restoration of scale invariance .",
    "both seem then to be linked , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that the large-@xmath1 limit of the proposed pure gauge effective potential has a u(1 ) symmetry , which emerges as the limit of a z@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this large-@xmath1 effective potential could be used in an approach where the traced polyakov loop is allowed to depend on the position , typically via a lagrangian of the type @xmath157 .",
    "of particular interest would then be to search for localised , solitonic , solutions of @xmath158 : one could then take advantage of the fact that finding solutions of a complex scalar field theory with a u(1 ) invariance is a topic that has attracted a considerable attention , mostly since coleman s work on q - balls  @xcite , and for which many results are already available .",
    "we hope to present such a study in future works .",
