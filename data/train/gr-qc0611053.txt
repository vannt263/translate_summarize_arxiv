    "when studying the properties of non - vacuum spacetimes in general relativity the choice of the matter model is important . in the present paper matter",
    "is described as a large ensemble of particles which interact only via the gravitational field created by the particles themselves and not via collisions between them .",
    "the distribution of the particles on phase space is given by a distribution function @xmath2 .",
    "this function satisfies the vlasov equation , a first order conservation law the characteristics of which are the geodesics of the spacetime metric , and on the other hand @xmath2 gives rise to macroscopic quantities such as mass - energy density , pressure , and mass current which act as source terms in the einstein field equations . for an introduction to kinetic theory in general relativity and the einstein - vlasov system in particular we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one distinguishing feature of the einstein - vlasov system is that it allows for a wide variety of static solutions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze spherically symmetric static solutions both numerically and analytically . after some general discussion of such steady states in the next section and a brief discussion of our numerical approach",
    "we investigate three different features of the steady states . in section  [ charss ] the energy density as a function of the area radius is characterized into three distinct classes . in particular , we study steady states which as a function of the area radius are supported in an interval @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath4 , which we call shells , as well as states supported in @xmath5 $ ] , which we call non - shells .",
    "one observation is that anisotropic steady states can have a quite rich structure , in particular when compared with their newtonian analogues , the steady states of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "for instance , the energy density can have arbitrarily many peaks and in the case of shells these can be separated by vacuum regions so that the steady states consist of rings of vlasov matter .",
    "then we consider the question whether there is an upper bound strictly smaller than @xmath6 of the quantity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the adm mass .",
    "for _ isotropic _ perfect fluid solutions which satisfy the hypothesis that the energy density is non - increasing outwards the inequality @xmath9 was shown by buchdahl @xcite .",
    "we prove a pointwise version of this inequality , cf .",
    "inequality ( [ buchdahl2 ] ) below , for a class of steady states of the einstein - vlasov system which includes , but is not restricted to , isotropic states . moreover , we give numerical evidence for the conjecture that all spherically symmetric steady states of the einstein - vlasov system satisfy this inequality , even if the energy density is not radially non - increasing .",
    "we mention in passing that the inequality is sharp in the case of shells , cf .",
    "@xcite .    if one prescribes the microscopic equation of state , i.e. , the way in which @xmath2 depends on the local energy and angular momentum , one obtains a one parameter family of steady states .",
    "in the last section we investigate the relation of the adm mass to the outer area radius of the steady state along such one - parameter families .",
    "we prove the existence of mass - radius spirals for the isotropic case by reducing it to a result of makino @xcite for isotropic fluids , and we give numerical evidence that these radius - mass spirals are present for any microscopic equation of state , independently of isotropy , a feature which is again in sharp contrast to the newtonian situation .",
    "in schwarzschild coordinates the metric of a static spherically symmetric spacetime takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11,\\,\\varphi\\in [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] .",
    "asymptotic flatness is expressed by the boundary conditions @xmath12 and a regular centre requires @xmath13 the static einstein - vlasov system is given by the einstein equations @xmath14 together with the static vlasov equation which can be written as @xmath15 the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be thought of as the momentum in the radial direction and the square of the angular momentum respectively .",
    "the matter quantities are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the mass energy density and @xmath20 is the radial pressure .",
    "before we discuss how solutions of this system can be obtained we note some additional equations which follow from the above .",
    "let the quasi - local mass be defined by @xmath21 the adm mass is then @xmath22 .",
    "using @xmath23 , the field equation ( [ ee11 ] ) together with the boundary condition ( [ regcent ] ) imply that @xmath24 and by ( [ ee22 ] ) , @xmath25 in particular , @xmath26 is radially increasing .",
    "( [ ee11 ] ) and ( [ ee22 ] ) are the @xmath27 and @xmath28 components of the einstein field equations , and given the matter quantities they together with the boundary conditions suffice to determine the metric .",
    "but the @xmath29 component of the einstein equations is also non - trivial and reads @xmath30 where the tangential pressure @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 eqn .",
    "( [ ee33 ] ) follows from ( [ ee11])([p ] ) ; the also non - trivial @xmath33 component is a multiple of the former .",
    "next we note that the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation @xmath34 holds for any sufficiently regular static solution of the spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov equation , as can be seen by a simple computation , using ( [ vlasov ] ) to express @xmath35 .",
    "finally , if we add ( [ ee11 ] ) and ( [ ee22 ] ) we obtain the identity @xmath36    let us now briefly discuss how one can establish the existence of static solutions of the spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov system ; for more details we refer to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the local or particle energy which like @xmath17 is conserved along characteristics of the static vlasov equation ( [ vlasov ] ) . the ansatz @xmath38 satisfies the vlasov equation , and the macroscopic matter quantities become functionals of the metric coefficient @xmath26 . substituting these into eqn .",
    "( [ mupeq ] ) and using ( [ lambdaeq ] ) the above system reduces to a single first order equation for @xmath26 .",
    "analyzing the latter constitutes an efficient way to prove the existence of static solutions with finite adm mass and finite extension .",
    "it should be pointed out that spherically symmetric static solutions which do not globally have the form ( [ ansats ] ) exist , cf .",
    "this contrasts the newtonian case where all spherically symmetric static solutions have the form ( [ ansats ] ) , a fact known as jeans theorem , cf .  @xcite . as a matter of fact , below",
    "we obtain steady states which are good candidates for solutions which are not globally of the form ( [ ansats ] ) .    in ( * ? ?",
    "2.1 ) it has been shown that in order to obtain a steady state of finite adm mass by the above approach there must exist a cut - off energy @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 . if @xmath43 and in particular such a cut - off energy is prescribed we obtain a steady state solution by prescribing @xmath44 and solving  numerically or analytically  the resulting equation ( [ mupeq ] ) radially outward .",
    "however , the resulting solution will in general not satisfy the boundary condition @xmath45 , but it will have some finite limit @xmath46 .",
    "one can then shift both the cut - off energy and the solution by this limit to obtain a solution which satisfies the boundary condition @xmath45 .",
    "this does not affect @xmath23 and hence also not @xmath47 , where it should be noted that the boundary conditions for the latter both at the centre and at infinity follow from ( [ lambdaeq ] ) , provided that the solution has finite adm mass and that @xmath19 is not too singular at the centre .    as long as one",
    "is interested in only a single steady state at a time this way of handling the boundary condition for @xmath26 at infinity is acceptable , but it is awkward when one studies families of such steady states , since @xmath39 and @xmath44 can not be treated as two free parameters if one insists on the boundary condition at infinity .",
    "hence we found it convenient to use an ansatz where the resulting equation for @xmath26 can be rewritten in terms of the function @xmath48 .",
    "the following is sufficiently general for our purposes : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 denotes the positive part , and @xmath540,\\infty [ \\to [ 0,\\infty[$ ] is measurable , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and there exist constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 such that @xmath590,1[.\\ ] ] with the ansatz ( [ ransatz ] ) , @xmath60 where for @xmath61 , and @xmath620,1]$ ] , @xmath63 @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and @xmath66 the equation to be solved for @xmath67 then becomes @xmath68 where the dependence of @xmath23 and @xmath20 on @xmath67 arises via the above formulas ( [ rhoyrel ] ) and ( [ pyrel ] ) .    in this way the cut - off energy @xmath39 disappears as a free parameter of the problem , and for @xmath69 , and @xmath70 fixed we obtain a one - parameter family of solutions parameterized by @xmath71",
    "once @xmath67 is determined on the support of the solution its limit @xmath72 at infinity can be computed , and if we define @xmath73 and @xmath74 we have a steady state with the proper boundary condition at infinity .",
    "notice that if @xmath75 , i.e. , the microscopic equation of state ( [ ransatz ] ) does not depend on angular momentum , then @xmath76 , i.e. , tangential and radial pressure are equal , which is why such steady states of the einstein - vlasov system are called _",

    "it is easy to see that eqn .",
    "( [ yeq ] ) has for any choice of @xmath84 a unique solution .",
    "the non - trivial question is which choices for @xmath85 lead to steady states of finite adm mass and finite extension . in (",
    "3.1 ) it has been shown that this is the case if @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are such that @xmath91 in this case the resulting steady state is non - trivial iff @xmath920,1[$ ] .    to conclude this section we briefly",
    "discuss how we construct the steady states numerically .",
    "if an ansatz of the form ( [ ransatz ] ) is given , the value of the integral @xmath93 and hence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 as functions of @xmath94 and @xmath95 can easily be computed . in practice",
    "we preferred to choose ansatz functions of the form @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath51 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 such that the relevant integrals @xmath100 can be computed explicitly by hand .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that such an ansatz leads to finite adm mass and compact support as well . in the newtonian case with @xmath101 ,",
    "this ansatz gives steady states with a polytropic equation of state . with @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "then given as functions of @xmath94 and @xmath95 we use a simple euler - type or a leap - frog scheme to solve the equation ( [ yeq ] ) , starting with some prescribed value @xmath1020,1[$ ] at the centre and moving with a fixed step size @xmath103 radially outward .",
    "if we are in a situation where the rigorous results cited above guarantee that the solution has a finite extension , the expression @xmath104 exceeds the threshold @xmath6 for sufficiently large values of @xmath94 .",
    "once this happens the computation can be stopped , and the spacetime can be extended by an exterior schwarzschild solution of the appropriate adm mass .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath105 the expression @xmath104 will always exceed @xmath6 for sufficiently small values of @xmath94 , and there will be no matter in the region @xmath106 in this case @xmath67 is constant in the inner vacuum region @xmath107 $ ] , and we start our numerical computation at the radius @xmath108 .",
    "the choice @xmath109 also leads to another complication , since in that case the support of the solution may in general consist of several concentric shells , a feature which is not captured if the computation is stopped the first time that @xmath104 again exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "in this section we are interested in the possible shapes of the energy density @xmath19 and its support . in particular we will numerically construct multi - peaked steady states which seem to have no analogue in the newtonian situation .",
    "we start with some simple analytic observations . without explicitly mentioning it",
    "we only consider non - trivial steady states of finite adm mass and compact support .",
    "in particular , @xmath110 for some area radius @xmath94 , and hence @xmath111 on an interval of the form @xmath112r_0,\\infty[$ ] where @xmath113 is given by ( [ r0 ] ) . notice that if @xmath109 then at @xmath114 by definition @xmath115 , and @xmath116 so that @xmath117 on some interval of the form @xmath112r_0,r_0 + \\delta[$ ] .    _",

    "this follows immediately from ( [ yeq ] ) .    _",

    "observation 3.3_. if @xmath86 , then the support of the solution is still an interval of the form @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "this follows from observation  ( 3.1 ) , eqn .",
    "( [ rhoyrel ] ) , and the strict monotonicity of the functions @xmath100 on their support , cf .",
    "( [ hprime ] ) .",
    "note however that in the anisotropic case @xmath119 the energy density @xmath19 is in general no longer monotone .    _",
    "observation 3.4_. if @xmath109",
    ", then we have vacuum in the interval @xmath107 $ ] , @xmath120 for @xmath121 , and the support is contained in some interval @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "as we shall see below the support will in general no longer be a single interval .",
    "steady states which are supported in @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath4 we call shells , and states with @xmath122 we call non - shells . in section  3.3 below we give a quite general characterization of both shells and non - shells for different values of the parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 . the main focus in that section is on cases which have rather small values on @xmath124 since this is a necessity for obtaining several peaks . in the following sections we have chosen to study shells and non - shells separately for values of @xmath124 which give no more than two peaks .",
    "one reason for this is that it is then easier to visualize the large difference in magnitude of the first peak compared to the following one for these values of @xmath124 ; in section  3.3 we really use the quantity @xmath125 rather than @xmath19 itself and moreover we use a logarithmic scale in order to get more informative pictures for the multi - peaks .",
    "the second reason is that we want to emphasize the important feature that shells can have separating vacuum regions whereas non - shells can not , and we find that this point is made more clear by first splitting the presentation into shells and non - shells .      since the main purpose of this and the next section is to emphasize a couple of features of the shape of the energy density which are present for any choice @xmath126 and @xmath127 when @xmath109 , we fix @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 . a more general analysis where the influence of all parameters is taken into account is carried out in section  3.3 below .",
    "let us for these values of @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath70 compute steady states with three different values of @xmath124 , namely @xmath133 .",
    "we find that these values give rise to three distinct states .",
    "when @xmath134 we get a pure shell , i.e. , the energy density increases , reaches a maximum value and then decreases to zero and remains zero for all larger values on @xmath94 . in the second situation ,",
    "when @xmath135 , the maximum value of @xmath19 is followed by a local minimum , strictly greater than zero ( this is hard to see in the figure but is easy to check in the data file ) , and then a tail with a small amplitude , relative to the maximum value , but with a considerable extension . in the final case , where @xmath136 , there is a vacuum region between the first part , which is a pure shell , and the tail . in this case",
    "a schwarzschild solution can be joined at the first point where the energy density vanishes which results in a different steady state , a pure shell .",
    "we point out that in @xcite it is indeed proved that the energy density vanishes close to @xmath108 if @xmath124 is small which corresponds to the third case above .",
    "furthermore , in section  2 we mentioned that jeans theorem does not hold for the einstein - vlasov system , cf .",
    "@xcite , and the distribution function @xmath2 of the steady state obtained by joining a schwarzschild solution as described above for @xmath136 is not globally given as _",
    "one _ function of @xmath137 and @xmath17 as in the ansatz ( [ ansats ] ) .      in the case",
    "when @xmath86 , the energy density can be strictly positive or vanish at @xmath138 ( depending on @xmath132 ) but it is always strictly positive sufficiently close to @xmath138 . hence , the support of the matter is an interval @xmath5 $ ] with @xmath139 , and we call such states non - shells . from observation 3.3",
    "it follows that no vacuum region can separate two parts of a non - shell . except for this fact ,",
    "the basic features of the shape of the energy density are preserved for non - shells . in figures  4 and 5",
    "the energy densities of two non - shells are shown , corresponding to @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we see that these have very similar features as the shells in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "again we note ( cf .",
    "figure  5 ) the large difference in amplitude of the first peak compared to the second one . in view of observation 3.3 , which implies that @xmath142 in @xmath5 $ ] , it is interesting to note that non - shells nevertheless mimic the behaviour of shells close to @xmath138 , cf .",
    "figure  5 , in the sense that the energy density almost vanishes on an interval @xmath107 $ ] , for some small @xmath4 .",
    "below we will see that the number of peaks is in general not restricted to two as in figures  2 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "however , numerically we found that already these solutions with two peaks seem to have no analogue for the vlasov - poisson system .      in this section",
    "we construct solutions where the energy density has many peaks , and we give numerical evidence that there is no limit to the number of the peaks . instead of plotting the energy density",
    "@xmath19 itself we plot @xmath143 ( or the logarithm of this quantity ) since the pictures become clearer due to the fact that the first peak which in amplitude is completely dominating gets reduced due to the factor @xmath144 . in general the amplitude of the peaks get smaller as @xmath94 increases and thus the quantity @xmath125 shows less difference between the peaks and the resolution in the pictures is improved , but we point out that the important features of @xmath19 are similar to those of @xmath145 .",
    "we have first chosen to study the non - shells , i.e. , @xmath86 . in figure  6",
    "the parameter @xmath128 is fixed and the dependence upon @xmath132 and @xmath124 is depicted .",
    "we see that the parameter @xmath124 has an important effect on the number of the peaks , eg . in the last row",
    "we get from two to four peaks by decreasing @xmath124 from @xmath146 to @xmath147 . increasing",
    "the parameter @xmath132 may also increase the number of peaks as seen in coloumn 2 and 3 .",
    "also the peaks become more narrow as @xmath132 is increased .",
    "we point out that more peaks are obtained by decreasing @xmath124 further , cf .  figure  11 which shows a shell with @xmath148 .    in figure  7",
    "we have fixed @xmath149 and @xmath150 which corresponds to the final case in figure  6 , and we investigate the influence of @xmath131 .",
    "we find that by increasing @xmath131 the decay rate of @xmath145 is affected for large @xmath94 and the peaks in general become wider as @xmath131 is increased .",
    "let us now turn to the shells .",
    "we first fix @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 and vary @xmath124",
    ". the result is shown in figure  8 .",
    "it is instructive to compare this result with the upper row in figure  6 .",
    "we see that the influence of a non - vanishing @xmath70 increases the amplitude of @xmath145 and also more peaks are obtained .",
    "the results obtained by varying @xmath70 are then shown in figure  9 .",
    "first of all we notice that the number of peaks is affected , and we also note that the peaks get more narrow as @xmath70 increases .",
    "in particular we get in the case when @xmath154 one vacuum region which separates the first two peaks and in the case when @xmath155 , there are two vacuum regions .    the dependence on @xmath132 is shown in figure  10 and a similar behaviour as in figure  6 is found .",
    "increasing @xmath132 can give rise to new peaks and quite generally it makes the peaks more narrow .",
    "finally we show in figure  11 a case where @xmath151 , @xmath156 , @xmath153 , and @xmath148 , which has ten peaks , and we note that there are three vacuum regions separating the first four peaks .    ,",

    "let us define @xmath157 in this section we investigate if @xmath158 has an upper bound less than one for static solutions of the spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov system .",

    "the authors also consider the general non - isotropic case without any monotonicity assumptions but instead they require that there is a constant @xmath191 such that @xmath192 under this assumption they obtain a bound on @xmath158 which for large @xmath191 can be written in the form @xmath193 as @xmath194 this bound degenerates to the estimate @xmath195 .",
    "this is interesting in view of the numerical results presented below which indicate that @xmath158 is _ always _ less than @xmath190 , while the energy density along a family of steady states which makes @xmath158 approach @xmath190 gets more and more peaked so that @xmath194 ( this is easily seen by considering an approximation of a dirac measure ) . in the case of shells",

    "thus , as is shown in ( b ) above a proof of our general conjecture below must rely on mechanisms which are rather different from the ones in the proof of theorem  [ buchdahl ] and also different from @xcite .",

    "this is clear in view of section  3 where it was seen that the first peak is strongly dominating compared to the other peaks and most of the matter is captured in the first peak .",

    "it is interesting to note the strong dependence of @xmath158 on @xmath132 which shows that the degree of anisotropy is crucial .",
    "in particular we see that the ( non - rigorous ) results by bondi in @xcite can be violated by anisotropic steady states .",
    "indeed , bondi considers isotropic matter models for which @xmath216 , or @xmath217 , and gets @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively as upper bounds of @xmath7 . since for vlasov",
    "matter @xmath220 , we see that the second bound is violated when @xmath132 is large , i.e. , the degree of non - isotropy is large , cf .",
    "the third case in figure  [ gammathreecases ] . for shells",
    "this bound is violated also when @xmath132 is small as we saw in figure  12 .",
    "the degree of anisotropy in this case is large for any @xmath127 , since @xmath221 as @xmath205 , cf @xcite .    by taking @xmath132 larger",
    "we get numerical evidence that also non - shells can have @xmath158 arbitrary close to @xmath190 , i.e. , @xmath222 , but still @xmath223 for any @xmath132 . in view of this claim and the claim made in the previous paragraph for shells ,",
    "we find that the most important insight from our simulations in connection to buchdahl s inequality is the following claim :    any static solution of the einstein - vlasov system satisfies @xmath224    as mentioned above , the result in @xcite shows that the inequality is sharp for shells and our numerical simulations indicate that it is also sharp for non - shells .",
    "it is an interesting and important problem to prove ( [ buchdahl2 ] ) in full generality .",
    "as we discussed in section  [ general ] for a fixed ansatz of the form ( [ ransatz ] ) there exists a one - parameter family of corresponding non - trivial static solutions which are parameterized by @xmath1020,1[$ ] where @xmath226 .",
    "one can now ask how for example the adm mass @xmath8 and the radius of the support @xmath227 change along such a family .",
    "more specifically , one can plot for each @xmath124 the resulting values for @xmath227 and @xmath8 to obtain a curve which reflects how radius and mass are related along such a one - parameter family of steady states .",
    "as a first example we choose @xmath75 and @xmath128 in ( [ pol ] ) , i.e. , an isotropic case , which results in the curve shown in figure  [ isospiral ] .      as a matter of fact , for the isotropic case one can show that such radius - mass curves always have a spiral form .",
    "the following theorem easily follows from the corresponding result established by makino for static , spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein - euler system under suitable assumptions on the macroscopic equation of state @xmath228 , cf .",

    "for this theorem we parameterize our one - parameter family of steady states via the inverse of the central pressure , i.e. , we define @xmath229 ; notice that @xmath230 is one - to - one on @xmath1120,1]$ ] and @xmath231 iff @xmath232 .",
    "[ rmspirals ] consider an isotropic ansatz of the form ( [ ransatz ] ) , i.e. , @xmath75 , and assume that the conditions on @xmath85 specified in ( [ phiass ] ) hold .",
    "then as @xmath231 , @xmath233 here @xmath234 and @xmath235 denote the radius of the support and the adm mass of the steady state corresponding to the parameter @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 are positive constants , @xmath191 is a non - singular matrix , @xmath239 is a rotation by the angle @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 are positive constants .    *",

    "if we denote its inverse by @xmath2470,1],\\ \\rho \\mapsto y,\\ ] ] we find that the pressure @xmath20 is related to the energy density @xmath19 through an equation of state @xmath248 the equations ( [ tov1 ] ) , ( [ tov2 ] ) , ( [ eqofstate ] ) now provide a closed system of equations which describes an isotropic einstein - vlasov steady state purely in terms of macroscopic quantities and a macroscopic equation of state .",
    "this system also arises from the static , spherically symmetric einstein - euler system .",
    "it describes a gaseous star and is studied in @xcite .",
    "hence to prove the theorem above we only have to show that our equation of state ( [ eqofstate ] ) satisfies the assumptions made in @xcite , and then we can invoke the corresponding result established there .",
    "firstly , @xmath249 is a smooth function of @xmath142 , since @xmath142 iff @xmath2450,1[$ ] iff @xmath250 we have @xmath251 for @xmath142 and since @xmath252 iff @xmath253 iff @xmath254 it follows that @xmath255 as @xmath252 .",
    "moreover , by ( [ hprime ] ) , @xmath256 for all @xmath257 , and also @xmath258 , so that the assumption ( a.0 ) in @xcite is satisfied .    the assumption ( a.1 ) in @xcite , namely that for @xmath259 , @xmath260 with some constant @xmath261 , is needed only to make sure that the solutions of the system ( [ tov1 ] ) , ( [ tov2 ] ) , ( [ eqofstate ] ) have finite radius . since we know this a priori by the assumption ( [ phiass ] ) , we need not check this condition . but using the results of @xcite one finds that ( a.1 ) holds with @xmath262 which lies in the required interval @xmath1124/3,2[$ ] iff @xmath263 , and this is precisely the assumption on @xmath131 in ( [ phiass ] ) for @xmath264 .",
    "the final condition ( a.2 ) which we need to check is that the limit @xmath2650,1[\\ ] ] exists , and that there exists some non - decreasing function @xmath266 such that @xmath267 for this it is useful to introduce the functions @xmath268,\\ ] ] so that @xmath2690,1].\\ ] ] then @xmath270 note that @xmath271 . moreover , @xmath272 if we can show that @xmath273 is bounded then the condition ( a.2 ) holds with @xmath274 and @xmath275 , where @xmath276 is a suitable constant . now @xmath277 and the functions @xmath278 and @xmath279 are continuous and positive on @xmath280 . hence it remains to show that the above fraction has a finite limit as @xmath253 .",
    "let us denote @xmath281 as @xmath282 .",
    "then by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 3.18 ) ) , @xmath283 as @xmath284 , since @xmath285 which is equivalent to @xmath286 .",
    "the latter holds by the assumption on @xmath131 in ( [ phiass ] ) , and the proof is complete .",
    "@xmath182    the theorem above is restricted to isotropic steady states , but numerically we have so far found no microscopic equation of state , isotropic or not , which does not lead to a radius - mass spiral , although for sufficiently anisotropic cases the spiral becomes rather deformed .",
    "corresponding examples are given in figures  [ nonisospiral ] and [ nonisospiral2 ] .",
    "the sharp corner in figure  [ nonisospiral2 ] is a genuine feature of this curve and can be explained as follows . for @xmath109 the steady state can consist of several shells of matter separated by vacuum . for @xmath124",
    "close to 1 only a single shell is present , but at a certain value of @xmath124 a second shell appears at a certain radius which causes the outer radius of the steady state to increase discontinuously while the mass remains more or less constant ; recall that @xmath287 iff @xmath288 , and although @xmath289 depends continuously on @xmath124 the region where the former condition holds can change discontinuously .",
    "we conjecture that such radius - mass spirals are a general feature of one - parameter families of steady states of the spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov system .",
    "this is surprising , since it is by no means true for the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "for example , the polytropic ansatz @xmath290 with @xmath291 , @xmath292 , and @xmath293 is known to lead to steady states with finite mass and compact support ; the particle energy @xmath137 is given in terms of the gravitational potential @xmath294 by @xmath295 if we keep @xmath131 and @xmath132 fixed we obtain a one - parameter family of steady states which is conveniently parameterized by @xmath296 . the resulting equation for @xmath297",
    "is @xmath298 where @xmath299 is some positive constant .",
    "one can obtain any solution of this equation by properly rescaling a fixed , particular one , say , the one with @xmath300 . using this fact it is easy to show that if @xmath301 there exists for each prescribed mass @xmath3020,\\infty[$ ] exactly one steady state in the family with that mass , and the relation between radius and mass is @xmath303 if @xmath304 all steady states of the family have the same mass . in the relativistic case",
    "the picture is very different , even for the same type of ansatz .",
    "if the prescribed mass is too large or too small there does not seem to be a corresponding steady state in the family , while for masses in the intermediate range there are in general more than one steady state of that mass .",
    "for the mass @xmath305 corresponding to the focus of the spiral , cf .",
    "theorem  [ rmspirals ] , there are infinitely many steady states of that mass , which differ in their radii .",
    "further interest in these radius - mass spirals comes from the fact that in astrophysical investigations conclusions about stability of the steady states in question are often drawn from them via the `` poincar turning point principle '' : if one knows from somewhere that one steady state on the upper part of the spiral to the right of its first maximum is stable then it is claimed that all steady states up to the first maximum of @xmath8 along the spiral are stable , and that towards the left of that point stability is lost .",
    "we can unfortunately not claim to understand the arguments by which this principle is supported , in particular not in the case of an infinite dimensional dynamical system such as the einstein - vlasov system , and we are not aware of any rigorous mathematical result on stability for this system beyond the preliminary results in @xcite",
    ". however , numerically we found in @xcite that along such a one - parameter family of steady states stability is lost if the so - called binding energy passes its maximum , and numerically it turns out that this happens at the same parameter value where @xmath8 attains its maximum .",
    "hence the prediction of the turning point principle agrees with the numerical stability analysis in @xcite .    above we showed analytically that radius - mass spirals are not always present in the newtonian case .",
    "an example where numerically one does find a radius - mass spiral is the so - called king model where @xmath306 this model is important in astrophysics . according to the turning - point principle outlined above there should be a transition from stable to unstable steady states along the corresponding one - parameter family , but it has been proven in @xcite that all steady states of king type are non - linearly stable ; the analogous result for the so - called relativistic vlasov - poisson system has been established in @xcite . it is conceivable that in the non - relativistic case one must plot other quantities instead of radius and mass to apply the turning - point principle , but if one for example plots the radius versus the total energy for the king model again a spiral arises , which in view of @xcite does not agree with the prediction of the turning - point principle .",
    "we conclude this section by emphasizing that the mathematically rigorous relation  if any  of such radius - mass spirals to stability properties of the steady states seems a very interesting and non - trivial problem in general and for the einstein - vlasov system in particular .",
    "an also very interesting problem is to prove that radius - mass spirals are present for the einstein - vlasov system in the anisotropic case as well , as our numerical experiments seem to indicate ."
