    "in the recent years spin - polarized transport in semiconductor microstructures has attracted much attention because of its important relevance to the emerging field of spintronics , a new branch of electronics where the electron s spin ( in addition to its charge ) is the active element for information storage and processing.@xcite an issue of fundamental importance in the emerging field of spintronics is the generation and control of high spin - polarized currents in semiconductors.@xcite recently high efficient injection of spin - polarized currents from magnetic to non - magnetic semiconductors have been achieved at low temperatures;@xcite however , efficient injection of spin - polarized currents from ferromagnetic ( f ) metals into semiconductors ( s ) has not yet been realized experimentally .",
    "but for room temperature spintronic devices , ferromagnetic metal sources are indispensable tools .",
    "detailed theoretical investigations have revealed that the main obstacle for spin injection from a f metal source into a semiconductor originates from the large mismatch between the conductivities of metals and semiconductors.@xcite it can be show that in a usual f metal / semiconductor heterojunction , the spin injection coefficient is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the conductivity of the semiconductor and the f metal , respectively . since @xmath3 ,",
    "the efficiency of spin injection in usual f metal / semiconductor heterojunctions is very small . at first glance",
    ", this problem seems insurmountable , but very recent theoretical investigations show that this obstacle may be overcome through the use of suitable potential barriers@xcite or through appropriate epitaxial interfaces that obey certain selection rules and band structure symmetry properties@xcite , and encouraging experimental results have also been obtained following the theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "these results suggest that devices made of combinations of f metals and semiconductors may be truly promising for applications in spintronics . among the most prominent device proposals that involve combinations of f metals and semiconductors is the spin field - effect transistor ( spin fet ) @xcite . in a spin fet ,",
    "two ferromagnetic metallic electrodes are coupled via a ballistic semiconductor channel .",
    "the current modulation in the structure arises from spin precession of injected spin - polarized electrons in the semiconductor channel due to rashba spin - orbit coupling , while two ferromagnetic metallic electrodes are used to preferentially inject and detect the spin - polarized currents .",
    "it has long been established both theoreticallylommer88,bychkov84 and experimentally@xcite that , arising from the structural inversion asymmetry , there is a spin - orbit interaction in two dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) on narrow - gap semiconductor ( such as inas ) surfaces .",
    "this underlying spin - orbit interaction was known as rashba spin - orbit coupling in the literatures . an important feature of rashba spin - orbit coupling is that its strength can by tuned by an external gate voltage , which alters the build - in structural inversion asymmetry . due to this fact",
    ", spin precession of injected spin - polarized electrons in the s channel of a spin fet can be tuned by applying an external gate voltage , and concomitantly , the current flowing through the device can be also modulated .",
    "this mechanism was first proposed in a seminal work by datta and dasdatta90 and recently , some important factors that will affect the behaviors of a spin fet were investigated in more details and with more realistic assumptions.@xcite in the present paper , we discuss the conductance modulations in spin fets under finite bias voltages .",
    "previous theoretical investigations have been focussed on the zero - bias conductance modulations in spin fets , but in practical applications a finite bias voltage need to be applied between both terminals of a spin fet , and the conductance - bias voltage characteristics of a device are usually very important for practical applications of the device . from theoretical viewpoints ,",
    "when a finite bias voltage is applied between two terminals of a spin fet , a longitudinal electric field will be established in the semiconductor channel of the device , and as was well known , in spin - orbit coupled systems , external electric field may play a more subtle role on electron s transport than in traditional electronic devices since in spin - orbit coupled systems the effect of electric field may be sensitively spin - dependent .",
    "( examples of unusual effect of electric field on electron s charge and spin transport in spin - orbit coupled systems can be seen from refs.@xcite . ) in the present paper we discuss the influence of finite bias voltages on the conductance modulations in spin fets due to rashba spin - orbit coupling . we will show that if a finite bias voltage is applied between two terminals of a spin fet , the conductance modulation in the structure due to rashba spin - orbit coupling may depend sensitively on the bias voltage , and in order to describe correctly the spin precession state of injected spin - polarized electrons in the semiconductor channel , the interplay between the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( which can be tuned via the gate voltage ) and the longitudinal electric field induced by the application of a finite bias voltage should be described in a unified way .",
    "for simplicity , in this paper we will restrict ourselves to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model . in one - dimensional systems the quantum interference effect due to rashba spin - orbit coupling will be maximum since the phase shifts of electrons are independent of their paths , so the idealized 1d model will give an upper limit for the achievable spin - transistor effect . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the phase shifts of electrons will depend on their paths and , hence , the spin - transistor effect will become weaker than what is predicted in a 1d model system .",
    "this was illustrated in ref.@xcite .",
    "though in the present paper we restrict our discussion to a 1d model system , the formulas given below are easy to be extended to systems with higher dimensions .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere . in the one - band effective - mass approximation ,",
