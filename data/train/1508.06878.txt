    "most species , and humans in particular , exhibit striking changes in social style across the lifecycle , in most cases as a consequence of a shift in emphasis from development to reproduction . in humans , a greatly extended period of socialization , combined with a virtually unique period of post - reproductive ( grandparental ) investment , adds significant complexity to this .",
    "although this much is obvious from casual observation , we actually know very little about the relative investment that individuals make as they age , or how this differs between the sexes . the last decade has seen a rapid growth and development in the information and communications technology ( ict ) , which has increasingly aided humans to connect to each other . among the different channels that have become accessible ,",
    "mobile phone communication is perhaps the most prominent as regards the number of users @xcite .",
    "this is the reason mobile phone call data records ( cdrs ) have increasingly been used to study various aspects of human behaviour @xcite .",
    "for example , from these cdrs one can construct egocentric networks that in turn allow one to undertake detailed studies of ego - alter relationships and the patterns of social investment that individuals make in the different members of their social networks @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that individuals telephone communication ( landline and mobile ) rates correlate with their face - to - face interactions @xcite .",
    "both the age and gender of individuals have been found to be important factors influencing their communication patterns in mobile phone networks : the gender and age preferences of egos for their alters , for example , have been found to correlate with their geographic proximity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of activation and deactivation of ties between individuals have been found to be different for the two genders and across age @xcite . in general ,",
    "homophily and heterophily , which are known to be factors shaping human social interactions @xcite , have turned out to be important in mobile phone communications , at least as regards to the gender preferences of an ego . in a previous study",
    "it was found that for younger egos , the most contacted alter is of the opposite sex @xcite .",
    "taken together , this suggests that , whatever their limitations might be , mobile phone data provide valid and reliable insights into human social patterns .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a large mobile phone dataset and study the structure of the individual level or egocentric networks . in general , we focus on their static structure for different non - overlapping periods , ranging from a month to a full year . in everyday life for both humans @xcite and other primates @xcite , time represents a direct measure of relationship quality . and ,",
    "because time is limited and social investment is costly in terms of time @xcite , individuals are forced to choose how to distribute that time across the members of their network @xcite . here",
    ", we use cross - sectional data on the frequency and duration of phone calls to examine how the pattern of social investment varies across the lifecycle in the two sexes .    b. the figures in the inset focus on the region where the crossover in behaviour for males and females is found .",

    "we analyze anonymized cdrs from a particular operator in a european country during 2007 .",
    "the cdrs contain full calling histories for the subscribers of this operator ( we term them ` company users ' and subscribers of other operators ` non - company users ' ) .",
    "there are @xmath0 million company users and around @xmath1 million non - company users appearing in the cdrs in the full one year period . out of the total set of company users",
    "there are @xmath2 million users for whom both the age and the gender are available and only a single subscription is registered . in this study , we have only focused on the voice calls and excluded sms entries from the cdrs .",
    "we construct an ego - alter pair if there is at least one call event between them during the observed time period . in general",
    ", we study calling patterns pertaining to pairs for whom age and gender are known .",
    "however , when the demographic information of the alters is not important for the analysis , we include individuals for whom this information is not known .    * additional filtering . * in the data set , there are company users for whom multiple subscriptions are found under the same contract numbers . for such users",
    "it is difficult to determine their real age and gender .",
    "we bypass this issue by considering the gender and age to be unknown for such users .",
    "the stored age of each company user corresponds to the year when the contract was signed ; as the starting year of users contracts ranged from 1998 to 2007 , we updated the age of each user according to the number of years between the beginning of the year when the contract was signed and the first day of 2007 .",
    "for some users , their contract starting date is unknown , so we add the average age - correction in the population , which was @xmath3 years ( rounded from the actual value of @xmath2 ) .",
    "first we show the variation in the average number of alters that egos contact in a month , as a function of ego s age . from fig .",
    "[ fig-1]a , we find that the number of alters reaches a maximum at an age of around @xmath1 .",
    "this is followed by a decrease till an age of around @xmath4 . from age @xmath4 , the number of alters contacted stabilizes for about a decade .",
    "after @xmath5 , there is again a steady decrease . in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b , we partition these data by gender . from the plot",
    ", it is clear that the average number of alters for males is greater than that for females for ages below @xmath6 .",
    "but from the age of @xmath6 onwards we observe that the number of alters for females is greater than that for males .",
    "to check the robustness of this finding , we use time windows of different length , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "we observe a consistent pattern and that there is a crossover age at around @xmath6 , irrespective of the time window used .",

    "indicate female and male egos , respectively.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      to investigate the interaction pattern of the egos belonging to different age groups , we measure the probability of interaction as a function of the age of alters . for egos of a given age",
    ", we find this probability by calculating the number of alters of any age and sex and divide by the total number of alters ( male and female ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] we plot the distribution for egos belonging to six different decadal age classes , namely @xmath10s , @xmath11s , @xmath12s , @xmath7s , @xmath8s and @xmath13s .",
    "in general , the distributions appear to be have double peaks .",
    "the difference between the ages at which the peaks appear is around @xmath1 years .",
    "this is roughly a generation gap and is similar to the results in @xcite where the age distribution of the most frequently contacted alter was investigated .",
    "notice that the focus of the peaks differs with increasing age : in the younger age groups , the main peak is on individuals of the same age ( peers ) , but from age @xmath7 this starts to be replaced by an increasingly large peak that is a generation younger than ego ( presumably ego s now adult offspring ) .",
    "note how these peaks track each other across the age space as ego ages .",
    "note also the asymmetry in calling pattern between parent and child : @xmath7-year - olds ( the parents ) call @xmath1-year - olds ( their adult children ) more than twice as often as the @xmath1-year - olds call them .",
    "this probability distribution is based on counting the number of alters at any given age . to examine in detail the appearance of the third peak , we quantify the strength of the interaction between the egos of age around @xmath7 and their alters at different ages .",
    "we consider egos of age @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 years and measure the following quantities in the time window of a month : ( i ) number of calls per alter , ( ii ) number of distinct days each alter is contacted , and ( iii ) calling time per alter ( time of all calls aggregated within monthly window ) .",
    "however , the total calling time fluctuates strongly , so in lieu of ( iii ) , we express the monthly aggregated duration of phone calls to an alter for a given ego as a fraction of the total calling time of that ego . in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] we show these three quantities as a function of the age of the alters , averaged over @xmath9 months .",
    "the plot shows the conspicuous presence of three peaks of comparable heights . for older alters ( those aged @xmath13 years or more ) the averages",
    "are inevitably affected by the small number of older mobile phone users .",
    "nonetheless , in general , the strength of communication appears to be larger when the alter is of the opposite gender and of similar age ( compare the plots corresponding to female - ego - to - male - alters [ red circles ] and male - ego - to - female - alters [ blue squares ] ) .      the structure of the communication pattern of egos is also reflected in the variation in the monthly aggregated call durations . in fig . [ fig-5]a and [ fig-5]b we plot the total calling time of egos and the calling time per alter , respectively .",
    "the plots show that females have larger total calling time as well as larger time per alter than males .",
    "interestingly , the crossover in the number of alters ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b ) does not get translated to the calling time per alter . for a given ego ,",
    "we rank the alters in terms of the monthly calling times and plot the calling time to the first rank alter ( fig . [",
    "fig-5]c ) .",
    "the time spent by an ego with the first rank is approximately @xmath14 times the time spent with an average alter .",
    "however , the variation in these quantities is very similar to that of the dependence of number of alters on the age of the ego .",
    "when the calling time to the first rank is expressed as a fraction of the total calling time , we observe three broad regimes , a rapid decrease till @xmath12 years of age , a slow variation in the range @xmath12@xmath8 years and a steady rise from @xmath8 years onwards .",
    "note that the variation over the whole age range is only @xmath15 of the average value which is around @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , a crossover in the behaviour of males and females is visible at the age of @xmath17 .",
    "months.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      having discussed the dependence of mobile communication upon the gender and age of the egos , we provide a different perspective by measuring the inequality in the way social effort ( indexed as calling times ) is partitioned among the alters through the gini coefficient for each ego .",
    "the gini coefficient is mainly used to quantify income inequality and its value varies from @xmath18 ( implying perfect equality ) to @xmath19 ( implying extreme inequality ) @xcite .",
    "we here use it as an evenness index : a gini value of @xmath18 implies that ego devotes equal amounts of time with all the alters and a value of @xmath19 implies that the ego spends all the time with only one alter .",
    "it is natural to expect that there should be a strong bias among the egos with regard to the calling time spent with the alters , during a certain period of time .",
    "here we analyse the nature of this bias by using the gini coefficient in two different ways .",
    "we note that , for egos of a given age , there is a typical value for the number of alters .",
    "this poses a difficulty in comparing two egos of different ages because the value of the coefficient is known to depend upon the size of the sample set .",
    "we circumvent this issue in the following way .",
    "first , we consider egos irrespective of their ages but having a fixed number of alters , and calculate the gini coefficient for the set of their monthly aggregated call times to the alters . fig .",
    "[ fig-6]a plots the distributions for sets of egos having different genders .",
    "comparison between the locations of the peaks suggest that females have overall higher gini values compared to males .",
    "next , we consider egos irrespective of their gender . we choose egos in the following age brackets : ( i ) @xmath1@xmath11 , ( ii ) @xmath12@xmath4 and ( iii ) @xmath5@xmath8 . for each ego",
    "we rank the alters with respect to the time of monthly aggregated call durations .",
    "then we choose the call times belonging to the top @xmath10 alters . for egos having less than @xmath10 alters",
    "we assume the missing call times to be zero .",
    "however , in the analysis we exclude all egos who have less than @xmath20 alters .",
    "the resulting distribution of gini values is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-6]b .",
    "we observe that the inequality among alters is larger for older people than for younger ones .",
    "the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig-6]b suggest that social effort becomes progressively less evenly distributed as people get older , and that this is true for both genders . in other words ,",
    "older people devote more attention to their first ranked alters than younger people do . in effect , younger people are socially more promiscuous , but as they age they focus more and more of their effort , or social capital , on a smaller subset of meaningful relationships . as it is likely that most of an ego s first few rank alters are family members , this might suggest that older people become more attached to their family compared to younger people .",
    "overall , the female egos exhibit higher inequality values than males do , and this suggests that females may be not only more socially focused than males , but also more attached to their family ( as folk wisdom would also suggest ) .",
    "in order to explore the patterns of social investment across the lifespan in humans , we studied the records of mobile communication belonging to a particular european operator over a one year period . as these records include information on the service subscribers age and gender , we are able to elucidate the nature of the interactions across the lifecycle . one important conclusion we can draw",
    "is that the average number of contacts is quite modest : in most cases , people focus their ( phone - based ) social effort each month on around @xmath21 people .",
    "this corresponds rather closely to the size of the second layer of egocentric personal networks in the face - to - face world @xcite . in the face - to - face world",
    ", this layer also represents the number of alters contacted at least once a month .",
    "thus , we provide some evidence that the use of mobile phone technology does not change our social world",
    ". it also provides further indirect evidence for the fact that we use the phone to contact those who are emotionally closest to us rather than simply those who live furthest away ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our main finding , however , is the fact that the maximum number of connections for both males and females occurs at the age of around @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) . during this early phase",
    ", males appear to be more connected than females .",
    "after this , the number of alters decreases steadily for both genders , although the decrease is faster for males than for females .",
    "the different rates of decrease result in a crossover around the age of @xmath6 such that after @xmath6 females become more connected than males .",
    "note , however , in the age group @xmath4@xmath5 , the number of alters stabilizes to a very conspicuous plateau for both males and females .",
    "projecting the slopes for the two graphs before the plateau suggests that the plateau represents a ` saving ' of around two alters who are retained as monthly alters rather than being lost to the next layer of less frequent contact .",
    "the difference between the plateau heights for females and males is around @xmath22 alters when the time window corresponds to one month .",
    "this difference grows to @xmath3 and @xmath23 alters when the window size is increased to four and twelve months , respectively .",
    "thus , there are two separate but interrelated phenomena : the plateau that appears in both sexes during this period and the difference between males and females in the number of alters contacted .",
    "since this age cohort is that in which ego s children typically marry and begin to reproduce in their turn , one likely explanation for this plateau is that it reflects the fact that parents are maintaining regular interaction with their adult children at a time when some of these might otherwise be lost .",
    "the difference between the sexes seems to be primarily due to the more frequent interactions by the females with their adult children and the children s spouses .",
    "also , females intimately interact with their own close family members ( e.g. keeping grandparents up - dated on the children s activities ) and the new in - laws created by their children s marital arrangements .",
    "this shift in women s social focus once her offspring reach adulthood and start to reproduce themselves is suggested by the appearance of a rather clear secondary peak in the number of alters aged about a generation ( @xmath1 years ) younger that appears in the contacts of @xmath7-year - olds ( fig .",
    "[ fig-3]d ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the profiles of younger cohorts ( those aged @xmath10@xmath12 years ) who show a small , but distinct , secondary peak about a generation older than themselves ( presumably their own parents ) .",
    "the positions of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] tell us quite a lot about domestic arrangements .",
    "for example , for this same - age cohort the peaks in the f - m ( circles ) and m - f ( squares ) curves in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] are slightly offset , with the m - f leading by about @xmath3 years .",
    "in other words , on average a woman s main same - age alter is three years older than she is , while that for a man is about three years younger .",
    "this is almost exactly the typical age difference between spouses in contemporary europe , including the country from which our sample derives @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] the peaks to the left are ego s children and the peaks to the right are ego s own parents .",
    "this suggestion is reinforced by the fact that these peaks track each other across the age space as ego ages .",
    "in addition , we found another crossover when we looked at the fraction of the total calling time devoted to the top ranked alter .",
    "this crossover occurs during the reproductively active period and its location roughly corresponds to the maxima in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "note , that before the crossover , the fraction for females , in fig .",
    "[ fig-5]d , is larger than that for males , even though their maximum number of alters is actually lower . as the most frequently contacted alter is typically of the opposite sex @xcite",
    ", we assume this to be the spouse . because the time costs of reproduction in humans are very high ( and may continue to be high for nearly two decades until the children reach marriageable age )",
    ", we expect that females give priority to their spouses rather than other kinds of peers ( siblings , cousins , friends ) during this period when their time ( and energy ) budgets are under intense pressure . as a consequence ,",
    "they maintain fewer relationships compared to males of the same age whose investment in their preferred alter seems to be much lower .",
    "a similar pattern of withdrawal from casual relationships so as to invest their increasingly limited available time in core relationships as time budgets are squeezed by the foraging demands of parental investment ( in this case , lactation ) has been noted in baboons @xcite .",
    "these results also seem to reflect female mate choice , with females persistently targeting their spouse in order to maintain investment in their chosen mate once they have made a choice ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that , when examined over the whole age range , the fraction varies little and remains around @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig-5]d ) .",
    "this observation suggests that across the lifespan , the fractional allocation for the top ranked alter ( the spouse ) remains conserved even though the absolute time budget decreases ( as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig-5]a ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the finding by @xcite , who reported , for a much smaller dataset , that the proportional distribution of social effort across all alters in an ego s network remains remarkably constant over time despite considerable change in network membership .",
    "more generally , fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] suggest that there was a marked difference in the evenness with which the two genders distributed their social effort , as well as a progressive shift towards being less even with age .",
    "females seemed to be generally more focused in their social arrangements than males , targetting more of their social effort onto fewer alters .",
    "this is reminiscent of the finding in @xcite that women appear to have a small number of extremely close same - sex friendships , whereas males do not ( they typically have a larger number of more casual same - sex friendships ) .",
    "in addition , both genders exhibit the same tendency to shift from being more socially promiscuous ( a more even gini value ) early in life to a more uneven ( higher gini value ) in their @xmath12s . since family dominate the inner layers of most people s social networks @xcite",
    ", this would suggest an increasing focus on family and close friendship relationships with age .",
    "this might reflect the fact that family relationships are more robust and resilient than friendships , as well as the fact that they are much more important as sources of lifelong support @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the greater social promiscuity of younger individuals could be interpreted as a phase of social sampling in which individuals explore the range of opportunities ( both for friendships and for reproductive partners ) available to them before finally settling down with those considered optimal or most valuable . in this respect",
    ", the younger individuals may be viewed as ` careful shoppers ' @xcite who continue to check out the availability of options , only later concentrating their social effort on a select set of preferred alters .",
    "one implication of this is that turnover ( or churn ) in network membership might start to fall dramatically at a particular point in the life cycle marked by a shift from this more promiscuous phase to the more stable phase associated with a reduced social network .",
    "[ fig-1 ] suggests that the mean number of alters contacted falls from @xmath21@xmath10 during this early phase to @xmath24@xmath21 after age @xmath12",
    "[ fig-1 ] and [ fig-5]d suggest that this switch in social focus may start to occur by the end of the third decade of life , and may thus coincide with the onset of reproduction .",
    "the average age of women at first birth in europe for the currently reproducing generation is around @xmath25 @xcite and would fit well with this prediction .",
