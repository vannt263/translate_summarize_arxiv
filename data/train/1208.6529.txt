    "<S> quantum error correction assisted by entanglement helps to transmit the encoded qudits through quantum channels with some of them being noiseless . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider a more realistic scheme for experiments what we called as _ partial - noisy _ quantum channels in which , instead of completely free of noise , only part of the qudit suffers no noise . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> we show by an explicit example that two half - noisy channels work better than one noiseless channel , a queer phenomenon showing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our example also saturates a unified quantum singleton bound , valid for the standard and entanglement - assisted codes as well . furthermore , as illustrated by a mixed - alphabet code with half - noisy channels , a higher dimensional physical qudit can so improve the performance of a partial - noisy channel that it even outperforms a noiseless channel .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum error correction @xcite is of great importance to the quantum computational technologies since it provides the primary tool , the quantum error - correcting code ( qecc ) , to fight against quantum noises . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is an essential resource that plays a key role in many quantum informational technologies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement - assisted quantum error - correcting code ( eaqecc ) @xcite combines those two ideas above by introducing some preexisting maximally - entangled pairs ( ebits ) between the encoder ( alice ) and the decoder ( bob ) before communication , where the qubits possessed by bob suffer no errors . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of eaqecc lies in the fact that it can be easily constructed , namely from any classic linear codes that are not necessarily self - dual , and , more exhilaratingly , the entanglement not only behaves as an assistance but also improves encoding rate comparing to the corresponding standard qecc @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a key step to implement the scheme of eaqecc is to prepare ebits between encoder and decoder . in order to share one ebit </S>",
    "<S> , one should prepare an entangled pair on alice s side then send one qubit to bob through a noiseless quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> however , the noiseless quantum channel does not exist in practice . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , eaqecc is only an ideal model with noiseless assumption which is difficult in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this seems a fatal limitation of the scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> the theory of quantum error correction is based on the assumption that the error occurring on any physical qudit is unknown during the process of transmission . </S>",
    "<S> thus a qecc should be designed to have the ability of detecting arbitrary errors on this qudit . however , there exist some specific dominant noisy processes in which the probability of some errors is much higher than that of others . here </S>",
    "<S> we call this kind of processes _ partial - noisy quantum channels_. for example , the well - known amplitude damping channel @xcite , which has been realized experimentally , is of this kind . a qubit transmitted though this channel only suffers two errors , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 being pauli operators , while there should be three errors in the general case . </S>",
    "<S> leung _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite first found a four - qubit code that can correct such one - bit errors , while the shortest standard qecc of distance 3 needs at least five qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that codes dealing with a restricted set of errors can have a higher encoding rate than codes dealing with general errors inspires us to consider the partial - noisy channels instead of the noiseless channels for quantum error correction , which can also be more easily implemented experimentally .    from its definition </S>",
    "<S> the partial - noisy channels are quite general : any quantum channel that causes a particular dominant quantum noise process can be regarded as a partial - noisy channel . </S>",
    "<S> encoding rate is the key criterion for the efficiency of any code construction . </S>",
    "<S> then a question arises naturally : how efficient is the scheme of qeccs with partial - noisy channels compared with the scheme of eaqeccs ? for this purpose we consider the following scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> let us take qudits of @xmath4 levels as physical resources and any @xmath4-level qudit can be regarded as a composite two @xmath5-level subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> denote the bit shift and phase shift operators of an @xmath5-level qudit by @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the ring of modular @xmath5 , then group @xmath10 forms an error basis of the @xmath4-level qudit . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a special partial - noisy channel called as _ half - noisy channel _ that does not bring any error to one of the two subsystems when the @xmath4-level qudit is transmitted through , i.e. , @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the error probability . apparently , if both subsystems are well - protected during the process of transmission , i.e. , @xmath13 , it is reduced to a noiseless channel . </S>",
    "<S> we label a noiseless channel by 1and a half - noisy channel by @xmath14 .    as usual </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath15 an eaqecc on @xmath16 qudits of @xmath17 levels , in which @xmath18 qudits suffer no errors , that has a @xmath19-dimensional encoding subspace detecting @xmath20-bit errors . </S>",
    "<S> similarly we denote by @xmath21 a code of distance @xmath22 that employs @xmath16 @xmath17-level qudits among which @xmath18 qudits are transmitted though half - noisy channels to encode @xmath19 logical states . </S>",
    "<S> then the comparison of the encoding rate should be made between two codes with parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively with the largest possible @xmath19 and @xmath25 , since these two scenarios use the same amount of resources ( @xmath26 qudits ) and forbid errors on the same number of subsystems ( @xmath27 subsystems ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , they have the same number of possible errors . if the ratio @xmath28 then the code with half - noisy channels is more efficient than the eaqecc .    specifically we consider the following task . </S>",
    "<S> alice is given five 9-level qudits and is asked to encode some quantum information in these physical resources that can correct any 1-bit errors and send to bob via some quantum channels . </S>",
    "<S> there are two kinds of quantum channels for the system : i ) one of the five channels is noiseless ; ii ) two of them are half - noisy channels . </S>",
    "<S> if alice uses the first kind of channels , as we know , the best she can do is to use the optimal eaqecc @xmath29 @xcite to encode 9 logical states . instead if she uses the second kind of channels to send encoded information to bob she can do better . </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out there exists a @xmath30 code , whose construction is given later , that encodes 27 logical states which is 2 times more than via the optimal eaqecc . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , in the process of quantum error correction @xmath0 happens , which means two half - noisy channels can work better than one noiseless channel .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the construction of qeccs with half - noisy channels , in which we need a recently discovered method called _ composite coding clique _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite based on the theory of graph state @xcite and coding clique @xcite . in general , for an @xmath31 code , the system of @xmath16 @xmath4-level qudits can be divided into two subsystems each of which contains @xmath16 @xmath5-level qudits . </S>",
    "<S> thus any half - noisy channel can be regarded as the composite of a noiseless channel for one subsystem and a general noisy channel for another . </S>",
    "<S> let us label the system with a vertex set @xmath32 containing @xmath16 vertices . </S>",
    "<S> denote by @xmath33 and @xmath34 two subsets of @xmath32 containing @xmath35 and @xmath36 vertices respectively that satisfy conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath33 and @xmath34 indicate the error - free qudits on the corresponding subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath9-weighted graph @xmath39 defined on @xmath32 is a composed of a set of weighted edges specified by the adjacency matrix @xmath40 which is an @xmath41 matrix with zero diagonal entries and the matrix element @xmath42 indicating the weight of the edge connecting vertices @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the graph state on @xmath45 reads @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the computational basis . </S>",

    "<S> considering that the @xmath29 code is optimal but our @xmath30 code can encode more logical states , qeccs with half - noisy channels should have a higher upper bound than the scheme of eaqeccs . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the quantum singleton bound @xcite and try to give an unified expression for the following three schemes : qeccs with half - noisy channels , eaqeccs and standard qeccs . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath76 a code of distance @xmath22 that employs @xmath77 @xmath4-level qudits among which @xmath18 and @xmath78 qudits are transmitted through noiseless channels and half - noisy channels respectively to encode @xmath19 logical states . when @xmath79 , or @xmath80 and @xmath81 , or @xmath82 and @xmath83 , it is reduced to a standard qecc , a qecc with half - noisy channels and an eaqecc respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then the calculation of the singleton bound follows the theorem in below .    </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 2 * for an @xmath76 code it holds @xmath84    partition @xmath77 qudits into 3 parts , i.e. , part @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 containing @xmath88 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 qudits respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all the @xmath18 noiseless qudits must be assigned into part @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> any half - noisy qudit in part @xmath85 or @xmath86 should be cut into two @xmath5-level halves and sacrifice the noiseless half to part @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> these operations ensures that all possible errors occurring on part @xmath85 or @xmath86 labeled by @xmath90 , @xmath91 also form a basis of them . </S>",
    "<S> denote the dimensions of the three parts by @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively and introduce three reduced projectors which are @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 with @xmath98 being the projector of the encoding space , we have @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> taking account of the error - correction condition that @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 , where the inequality is due to @xmath103 . thus @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath105 holds for part @xmath86 as well . </S>",
    "<S> then we can obtain an inequality that @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> different partitions may lead to different values of @xmath94 and the singleton bound should be the smallest one that @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we calculate the value of @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly condition @xmath109 must be satisfied since both part @xmath85 and @xmath86 can not contain noiseless qudits . </S>",
    "<S> secondly the less half - noisy qudits are assigned into part @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the smaller the value of @xmath94 will be , since the noiseless halves of the half - noisy qudits in part @xmath85 and @xmath86 increase the dimensions of part @xmath87 . when @xmath110 , all half - noisy qudits could be assigned into part @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath111 when @xmath112 , part @xmath85 and @xmath86 contain at least @xmath113 half - noisy qudits , which means part @xmath87 will be extended by @xmath113 noiseless @xmath5-level halves at least . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have @xmath114    now let us see how our scheme enhances the singleton bound . according to the theory , if @xmath82 , then @xmath110 no matter @xmath80 or not . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , singleton bound for both standard qeccs and eaqeccs is @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath81 , then @xmath116 could be less than @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case @xmath118 , which means qeccs with half - noisy channels is the best scheme among the three . </S>",
    "<S> analyzing from the aspect of errors , our scheme and eaqeccs have a smaller number of possible errors than standard qeccs , thus they have a higher encoding rate . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our scheme reduces the number of short - bit errors comparing with the corresponding eaqeccs , hence it has a higher upper bound than eaqeccs although the total number of possible errors are the same . </S>",
    "<S> now we look back on the example we present above . </S>",
    "<S> the singleton bound for the @xmath119 code is @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> however , since our scenario of two half - noisy channels has a smaller number of 1-bit and 2-bit errors , the singleton bound is enhanced to @xmath121 which means our @xmath30 code is optimal as well .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that two half - noisy channels can work better than one noiseless channel in the process of quantum error correction . </S>",
    "<S> however , one may ask another question : is there any method that can give rise to one half - noisy channel working better than one noiseless channel ? we find that the answer is positive as shown by the following example .    as we know , the optimal eaqecc of distance 3 with 8 qubits and one ebit is @xmath122 @xcite . when the noiseless channel is replaced by a half - noisy channel , how to make the code encoding more logical states ? </S>",
    "<S> our scheme is to employ a 4-level qudit instead of a qubit to be transmitted through the half - noisy channel . </S>",
    "<S> hence the code should be denoted by @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that this is a qecc over mixed alphabets @xcite as well since the physical resources for encoding have different number of energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> _ composite coding clique _ is also the primary tool of constructing mixed - alphabet qeccs . </S>",
    "<S> thus it should be involved to construct this @xmath123 code , as long as the corresponding positions of the uncoverable set and purity set are fixed to be error free . </S>",
    "<S> more details can be found in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> here we regard the 4-level qudit as a composite of two qubits one of which suffers no errors . </S>",
    "<S> given a @xmath124-weighted graph @xmath125 on 10 vertices with the last vertex being error free as shown in fig.1(b ) , we can find a composite coding clique generated by 5 generators that reads @xmath126 then the encoding space spanned by basis @xmath127 defines a more efficient @xmath73 code . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the performance of the half - noisy channel with a 4-level qudit becomes even better than the noiseless channel . </S>",
    "<S> the example tells us that a higher dimensional qudit can help to improve the performance of a partial - noisy channel . in other words , if we do not have enough partial - noisy channels in hand to transmit encoded informations , we should consider to employ some higher dimensional qudits to do the encoding .    </S>",
    "<S> in this article we consider the situation of the partial - noisy channels for qeccs to overcome the fatal limitation of eaqeccs  non existence of the noiseless quantum channels . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we discover , via an example of @xmath30 code , that our scheme could be more efficient than the scheme of eaqeccs . </S>",
    "<S> more exhilaratingly , a unified singleton bound is derived showing that the code we find is not unique . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme truly has the higher upper bound than the other two schemes ( eaqeccs and standard qeccs ) , which shows the great potential of our method of code construction .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many different kinds of partial - noisy channels depending on physical systems in laboratory , and some of them may not be well described yet since that the exact implementation systems are not fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the results of half - noisy channels which can be easily mapped to noiseless channels provide us a start point for more complicated situations . </S>",
    "<S> this opens a new direction in studying qeccs in a more realistic background . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that other kinds of partial - noisy channels can work better than the noiseless channels as well , some may even be more powerful than the half - noisy channels . following the scheme in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we need to identify the corresponding mappings between different channels , find methods to construct codes with other kinds of partial - noisy channels and propose the corresponding quantum singleton bounds .    </S>",
    "<S> the construction of the @xmath73 code shows another phenomenon that the cooperation of mixed - alphabet qeccs and partial - noisy channels could lead to better efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> though it also brings higher complexity in constructions , the potential of the cooperation is worth being further explored .    </S>",
