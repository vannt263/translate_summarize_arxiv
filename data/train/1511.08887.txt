    "wireless relaying , as a promising technique to extend the coverage and increase the system capacity , have attracted much research interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "physical - layer network coding ( pnc ) @xcite is an advanced relaying technique that significantly enhances spectral efficiency by allowing a relay node to decode and forward message combinations rather than individual messages .",
    "pnc was first proposed as a two - way relaying mechanism , where two users exchange information via a relay node .",
    "later , the idea of pnc was extended to support efficient communications over multiway relay channels ( mrc ) @xcite , where multiple users exchange data with the help of a single relay .",
    "efficient pnc design has been studied for various data exchange models , including pairwise data exchange @xcite , full data exchange @xcite , and clustered pairwise / full data exchange @xcite .",
    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques have also been incorporated into pnc - aided relay networks to achieve spatial multiplexing @xcite .",
    "the capacity of general mimo mrc remains a challenging open problem @xcite .",
    "existing work @xcite was mostly focused on analyzing the degrees of freedom ( dof ) that characterizes the capacity slope at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "various signaling techniques have been developed to intelligently manipulate signals and interference based on the ideas of pnc and interference alignment @xcite .",
    "particularly , the authors in @xcite studied the dof of the mimo y channel , where three users exchange data in a pairwise manner with the help of a single relay . to derive the dof of this model ,",
    "a key difficulty is how to jointly optimize the linear processors , including the precoders at the user transmitters , the precoder at the relay , and the post - processers at user receivers .",
    "this problem was elegantly solved in @xcite by optimal design of the signal space seen at the relay , where the user precoders and post - processors are constructed by _ pairwise signal alignment _ and _ uplink - downlink symmetry _ , and the relay precoder by appropriate orthogonal projections .",
    "similar ideas have also been used to derive the dof of other multiway relay models @xcite .    in the work on mimo mrc mentioned above , a major limitation is that a single relay node is employed to serve multiple user nodes simultaneously .",
    "this implies that the relay node is usually the performance bottleneck of the overall network @xcite . as such , some recent work began to explore the potential of deploying more relay nodes for enhancing the network capacity .",
    "for instance , the authors in @xcite derived an achievable dof of the two - relay mimo mrc in which two pairs of users exchange messages in a pairwise manner via two relays .",
    "later , the work in @xcite improved the dof result in @xcite by using the techniques of pairwise signal alignment and uplink - downlink symmetric design .",
    "the extension to the case of more than two user pairs was also considered in @xcite . however , the dof characterization of the multi - relay mimo mrc is still at a very initial stage .",
    "on one hand , the achievability proof of @xcite relies on some recent progresses on the solvability of linear matrix systems , and is difficult to be extended for other multi - relay mrc models , especially those with more than two relay nodes . on the other hand , for a multi - relay mrc , as the received signals at geographically separated relays can not be jointly processed ,",
    "manipulating the relay signal space is far more difficult than the single - relay case .",
    "also , there is no guarantee that the optimal single - relay techniques , such as pairwise signal alignment and uplink - downlink symmetric design , are still optimal for a multi - relay mrc .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the dof of the symmetric multi - relay mimo y channel , where three user nodes , each with @xmath0 antennas , communicate with each other via @xmath1 relay nodes , each with @xmath2 antennas . compared with the mimo y channel in @xcite ,",
    "a critical difference is that our new model contains an arbitrary number of relays , rather than only a single relay .",
    "following @xcite , we formulate a general dof achievability problem for the multi - relay mimo y channel based on linear processing techniques , involving the design of user precoders , relay precoders , and user post - processors .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows .    * in contrast to the conventional uplink - downlink symmetric design , we propose a new uplink - downlink asymmetric approach to solve the dof achievability problem .",
    "specifically , in the proposed approach , only user precoders are designed based on signal space alignment ; the user post - processors are designed for interference neutralization .",
    "furthermore , the uplink - downlink asymmetry also allows the relays to deactivate a certain number of receiving ( not transmitting ) antennas to facilitate the signal space alignment at relays .",
    "* given the designed user precoders and post - processors , the original problem boils down to a linear system on the relay precoders with certain rank constraints . to tackle the solvability of this system",
    ", we establish a novel method to solve linear matrix equations with rank constraints .",
    "we emphasize that this method can generally be used to analyze the dof of other multi - relay mrcs with various data exchange models . * based on the above new techniques , we derive an achievable dof of the symmetric multi - relay mimo y channel with an arbitrary configuration of @xmath6 .",
    "our dof result significantly outperforms the dof of the single - relay mimo y channel , implying that introducing multiple relays greatly enhances the relaying capability of the network .",
    "also , our achievable dof is considerably higher than the achievable dof with the uplink - downlink symmetric approach in @xcite .",

    "this means that , in the design of user precoding and post - processing , only @xmath78 are used for the purpose of aligning signals to reduce the number of linearly independent equations in - ; the post - processors @xmath80 are used for nulling interference rather than for signal alignment .",
    "this introduces additional freedom for system design .",
    "further , to exploit the advantage of this uplink - downlink asymmetric design , we allow a certain number of _ receiving _ ( but not transmitting ) antennas at each relay to be deactivated . with this treatment , signal alignment can be performed in a larger range of @xmath91 . with the above design of @xmath78 and @xmath132",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of a new network information flow model called symmetric multi - relay mimo y channel , where three user nodes , each with @xmath0 antennas , communicate via @xmath1 geographically separated relay nodes , each with @xmath2 antennas . for this model </S>",
    "<S> , we establish a general dof achievability framework based on linear precoding and post - processing methods . </S>",
    "<S> the framework poses a nonlinear problem with respect to user precoders and post - processors , as well as relay precoders . to solve this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt an _ uplink - dowlink asymmetric _ strategy , where the user precoders are designed for signal alignment and the user post - processors are used for interference neutralization . with the user precoder and post - processor designs fixed as such , the original problem then reduces to a problem of relay precoder design . to address the solvability of the system </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a general method for solving matrix equations . </S>",
    "<S> this method is also useful to the dof analysis of many other multiway relay networks . </S>",
    "<S> together with the techniques of antenna disablement and symbol extension , an achievable dof of the symmetric multi - relay mimo y channel is derived for an arbitrary setup of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for @xmath4 , the optimal dof is achieved for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that for symmetric multi - relay mimo y channel , our design outperforms the conventional uplink - downlink symmetric design considerably .    </S>",
