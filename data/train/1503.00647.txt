    "the study of the hadronic structure in the non - linear regime of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the main goals of the future electron - ion colliders ( eic ) @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the resulting experimental data will be able to determine the presence of gluon saturation effects , the magnitude of the associated non - linear corrections and what is the correct theoretical framework for their description .",
    "this expectation is easily understood , if we analyse the bjorken-@xmath6 and nuclear mass number @xmath2 behaviours of the nuclear saturation scale , @xmath7 , which determines the onset of non - linear effects in the qcd dynamics @xcite .",
    "assuming that the saturation scale of the nucleus is enhanced with respect to the nucleon one by the _ oomph _",
    "factor @xmath8 , it can be expressed by the parametrization @xmath9 . as a consequence nuclei are an efficient amplifier of the non - linear effects . in fig .",
    "[ qsa ] we present the theoretical expectations for the saturation scale as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath2 , considering the parameters @xmath10 gev@xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 as in ref .",
    "we can observe that , while in the proton case we need very small values of @xmath6 to obtain large values of @xmath13 , in the nuclear case a similar value can be obtained for values of @xmath6 approximately two orders of magnitude greater .",
    "consequently , the parton density that is accessed in electron - nucleus ( @xmath0 ) collisions would be equivalent to that obtained in an electron - proton collider at energies that are at least one order of magnitude higher than at hera .    the enhancement of the non - linear effects with the nuclear mass number has motivated the development of an intense phenomenology about the implications of these effects in inclusive and diffractive observables which could be measured in the electron - ion colliders @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that the analysis of inclusive observables , as e.g. the nuclear structure functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , probably will not be the best way to obtain a signature of the non - linear effects due to the large uncertainty present in the collinear predictions at small @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , diffractive events in @xmath0 collisions are expected to be a smoking gun for the gluon saturation physics .",
    "basically , saturation physics predicts that in the asymptotic limit of very high energies , diffractive events will be half of the total cross section , the other half being formed by all inelastic processes @xcite . in the kinematical range probed by the future eic , diffractive processes are expected to contribute by a large amount ( @xmath16 ) to the total cross section @xcite .",
    "this observation have motivated more detailed studies of the diffractive interactions , with special attention to exclusive diffractive vector meson production and the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , which are experimentally clean and can be unambiguously identified by the presence of a rapidity gap in final state . as these exclusive processes are driven by the gluon content of the target , with the cross sections being proportional to the square of the scattering amplitude , they are strongly sensitive to the underlying qcd dynamics . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite we have presented a systematic analysis of these processes in terms of the non - linear qcd dynamics and derived the energy dependence of the total vector meson ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and dvcs cross sections .",
    "a shortcoming of these studies is that the distributions on the square of the momentum transfer ( @xmath3 ) , which are an important source of information about the spatial distribution of the gluons in a nucleus and about fluctuations of the nuclear color fields , were not estimated .",
    "recently , these distributions were calculated in refs .",

    "in particular , we update the previous calculations considering the more recent models for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude and presenting the predictions for the @xmath3-dependence of the nuclear dvcs cross section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the description of the nuclear dvcs in the color dipole formalism . in section [ qcd ]",
    "we discuss the models for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude used as input in our calculations and present a comparison between its predictions . in section [ res ]",

    "<S> the study of exclusive processes in the future electron - ion ( @xmath0 ) colliders will be an important tool to investigate the qcd dynamics at high energies as they are in general driven by the gluon content of the target which is strongly subject to parton saturation effects . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we compute the coherent and incoherent cross sections for the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) process relying on the color dipole approach and considering different models for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the dependencies of the cross sections with the energy , photon virtuality , nuclear mass number and squared momentum transfer are analysed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the ratio between the incoherent and coherent cross sections decreases at smaller values of @xmath1 and increases at smaller values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coherent cross section dominates at small @xmath3 and exhibits the typical diffractive pattern , with the number of dips in the range @xmath4 gev@xmath5 increasing with the mass atomic number . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the position of the dips are independent of the model used to treat the dipole - proton interaction as well as of the center - of - mass energy . </S>"
