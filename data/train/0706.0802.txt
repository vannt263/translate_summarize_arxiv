    "over the past decades , important efforts have been devoted to improve our understanding of the physical conditions in protostellar clouds .",
    "these studies have enabled to draw an evolutionary sequence of the stages prior to the formation of protostars , through the morphological , dynamical and chemical characteristics of the clouds .",
    "recent progress in detection capabilities in the far infrared , sub  mm and mm windows , have permitted to constrain the density distribution of molecular clouds through measurements of dust absorption and emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been found that the geometrical structure of cold dark clouds is consistent with an inner region of nearly constant density and a surrounding envelope that has a density which decreases as a power law .",
    "the density distribution thus obtained is often used as a starting point for molecular line studies and allows to constrain the spatial distribution of the molecules ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , from nh@xmath7 inversion lines it has been found that the clouds are nearly isothermal @xcite .",
    "such observational constraints are of great interest to understand the physical mechanisms that drive the collapse .",
    "however , the balance between gravitational energy and support mechanisms such as thermal pressure , turbulence or magnetism is yet to be understood @xcite .",
    "moreover , theoretical studies predict that the initial conditions strongly affect the way the collapse of the cloud evolves .",
    "in particular , time dependent studies , which couple both dynamical and chemical processes , have shown that molecules can be used as tools to probe the stage of evolution prior to the formation of protostars .",
    "these studies also predict that deuterium fractionation increases with time and that the d / h ratio can reach high values for a variety of species @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to put observational constraints on the spatial structure of a sample of dark clouds through observations of a late type molecule , n@xmath1h@xmath2 , and of its deuterated isotopologue n@xmath1d@xmath2 .",
    "these molecules are well adapted to probe the innermost dense regions of dark clouds due to their high dipole moments and also because they are weakly depleted onto dust grains .",
    "while molecular observations are a very powerful tool to derive the physical and chemical conditions of the gas in these regions , the interpretation of the observations needs essential informations on molecular physics data , such as collisional rate coefficients , line intensities and frequencies .",
    "molecules often used as tools , like n@xmath1h@xmath2 , have been interpreted so far with crude estimates of these parameters .",
    "recently , @xcite have computed collisional rate coefficients between n@xmath1h@xmath2 and he for the range of temperatures prevailing in cold dark clouds and low mass star forming regions .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as ) have modeled , using these new rates , the emission of n@xmath1h@xmath2 in dark clouds .",
    "a wide range of physical conditions has been explored in order to have a general view of the different processes that could lead to the observed intensities of n@xmath1h@xmath2 hyperfine lines .",
    "observations are described in section [ observations ] . in section",
    "[ clouds ] we present the results obtained for each cloud and we derive the physical conditions of the gas as well as n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 abundances .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the excitation processes occurring for deuterated species are analyzed in the appendix .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 observations were performed during several observing sessions .",
    "additionally , we make use of n@xmath1d@xmath2 data already discussed by @xcite .    observations of the n@xmath1d@xmath2 @xmath0=21 line have been obtained at the iram30 m telescope ( granada , spain ) in july 2000 during average weather conditions .",
    "the pointing was checked regularly on nearby continuum sources , and the focus was checked on small planets .",
    "the data have been taken in frequency switching mode , with the mixers connected to the versatile , high spectral resolution , correlator vespa .",
    "the n@xmath1d@xmath2 @xmath0=10 data have been taken in august 2004 when the tuning range of the 3 mm mixers was extended to frequencies lower than 80 ghz .",
    "simultaneous observations of n@xmath1d@xmath2 @xmath0=32 were performed using two mixers tuned at this frequency .",
    "the system temperature was @xmath8 k at 77 ghz and @xmath9 k at 231 ghz .",
    "particular care was given to the intensity calibration as the mixer tuning is done without side band rejection at these low frequencies .",
    "the image side band gain has been measured on an offset position or a continuum source for each object , and applied during the data processing .",
    "further observations of the @xmath0=10 , 21 and 32 lines of n@xmath1h@xmath2 and of the n@xmath1d@xmath2 @xmath0=32 line were carried out in january 2005 with the iram30 m telescope .",
    "four receivers tuned at the frequency of these lines were used simultaneously .",
    "pointing was checked every hour on continuum sources close to the targets .",
    "the relative alignment of the receivers was checked with saturn and jupiter and found to be better than 2.0  .",
    "our observations indicate that the offsets on the sky from the pointing derived with the 3 mm receiver were 1.0  , 2.0  and 1.0  for the 2 mm , 1 mm low frequency and 1 mm high frequency receivers respectively .",
    "focus was checked at the beginning and end of each observing shift .",
    "it was found to be stable for the entire observing run .",
    "the weather was excellent during observations with a typical water vapor amount above the telescope site of @xmath5 1.0 mm , or even better .",
    "calibration was performed using two absorbers at ambient and liquid nitrogen temperatures .",
    "the atm package @xcite was used to estimate the significant atmospheric parameters for the observations .",
    "the typical system temperatures were 100 k , 1000 k and 250 k at 3 , 2 and 1 mm respectively .",
    "the @xmath0=21 line was observed in upper side band which avoided the possibility of rejecting the image side band in the 30m receivers .",
    "the large system temperature for this transition is due to the high opacity of the atmosphere at 186 ghz and to the fact that the frequency is at the edge of the tuning range of the receiver .",
    "calibration uncertainties for the @xmath0=10 and 32 lines are well below 10% ( the standard calibration accuracy under good weather conditions ) .",
    "however , the @xmath0=21 line has a larger uncertainty due the effects commented above , and , in order to have an estimate of the calibration accuracy we observed the continuum emission of jupiter , saturn and mars at different elevations .",
    "we have found that the intensity of the @xmath0=21 transition was always compatible with the expected one",
    ". however , these double side band observations of the planets are not very sensitive to the side band rejection .",
    "nevertheless , these data allow us to derive beam efficiencies for each frequency .",
    "they are in excellent agreement with those published for the 30m iram telescope .",
    "for some strong sources we observed several times a reference position and we noted that the @xmath0=21 line intensity had calibration errors up to 20% depending on the elevation of the source . we conclude that with the configuration adopted for the 2 mm receiver , the upper signal side band has a gain of 0.35 rather than 0.5 ( perfect dsb ) .",
    "this fact introduces systematic errors in the determination of the sky opacities .",
    "it is impossible to estimate the actual error for each source .",
    "hence , for the @xmath0=21 line we assume a typical calibration error of 20% . nevertheless , most observed @xmath0=21 intensities agree with those expected from the results of the @xmath0=10 and 32 lines ( see sect .",
    "[ clouds ] ) . only for tmc2 ,",
    "l1489 and l1251c it has been necessary to correct the @xmath0=21 intensities by multiplicative factors of , respectively , 0.8 , 0.8 and 0.85 in order to have data consistent with the well calibrated @xmath0=10 and 32 lines .    the observations were performed in frequency switching mode .",
    "as all sources have narrow lines , the baseline resulting from folding the data has been removed by fitting a polynomial of degree 2 .",
    "figure [ graph : data ] shows the n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 observed lines in selected sources and table [ table : obs_mod ] gives the position of the clouds observed in this paper ( see section [ clouds ] ) .",
    "the intensity scale is antenna temperature , t@xmath10 . in order to compare the results of our models with observations",
    ", we have to convolve model results with the beam pattern of the 30m iram telescope .",
    "we have adopted half power beam widths ( hpbw ) of 27  , 13.5  and 9  , beam efficiencies of 0.76 , 0.59 and 0.42 , and error beams of 350  , 220  , and 160  for the @xmath0=10 , 21 and 32 lines of n@xmath1h@xmath2 . for n@xmath1d@xmath2",
    ", we adopted hpbw s of 32  , 17  and 10.5  , beam efficiencies of 0.79 , 0.69 and 0.52 and the same error beams as for n@xmath1h@xmath2 lines .",
    "the whole data set for all observed sources is shown in figures 3 to 15 .",
    "over the past decades , mm continuum observations and star count analysis @xcite have revealed that the density structure of cold dense cores closely matches a bonnor  ebert sphere , with an inner region of nearly uniform density and steep outer edges where the density decreases as r@xmath11 with p = 2  2.5 .",
    "this description is valid for r @xmath12 0.1 pc typically , and at larger scales ( 0.1  1 pc ) , the density structure of the outer envelope has been shown to vary from sources to sources .",
    "for example , @xcite have found that a shallow density profile , n(r ) @xmath13 r@xmath14 , is adequate to model the density structure of the envelope of the taurus ",
    "auriga complex . in this section",
    ", we use a density profile which corresponds to n(r ) = n@xmath15 for r @xmath12 r@xmath15 and n(r ) = n@xmath15(r@xmath15/r)@xmath16 for r @xmath17 r@xmath15 . in order to characterize the clouds , we determine the value of the central density , i.e. n@xmath15 , and the radius of the inner flat region , i.e. r@xmath15 . for l1517b",
    ", we compare the results obtained using this density profile with the phenomenological density law used in @xcite .",
    "the observed line profiles for n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 @xmath0=10 , 21 , and 32 lines are shown in figures 3 to 15 . in order to model our data",
    "we have found that some additional constraints were necessary .",
    "in particular the extent of the emission has been found to be a critical parameter to derive physical conditions .",
    "our data are in most cases related to one single observed position ( except for l183 for which we have a map in several transitions ) .",
    "fortunately , some clouds presented in this section have been mapped in the @xmath0=10 transitions of n@xmath1h@xmath2 by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( in the discussion of the sources , if not specified , n@xmath1h@xmath2 maps refer to data from @xcite ) . for six sources ( l63 , l43 , l1489 , l1498 , l1517b , and tmc2 ) they have reported @xmath0=10 integrated intensity versus impact parameter .",
    "thus , we have checked that the profile of the @xmath0=10 integrated intensity provided by our models was consistent with those data . for the other clouds ,",
    "similar data could not be found in the literature .",
    "the radiative transfer models aim at reproducing our @xmath0=10 , 21 and 32 line intensities and the @xmath0=10 radial emission profile . a discussion concerning the assumptions made to model n@xmath1d@xmath2 is given in the appendix ( that deals in particular with the determination of collisional rate coefficients for the isotopologue of n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) .",
    "observed positions , central line intensities and adopted distances to the sources are given in table [ table : obs_mod ] .",
    "we report in the same table the @xmath0=10 emission half power radius ( noted @xmath18 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the radius which encloses half of the @xmath0=10 total intensity which emerges of the cloud .",
    "the convolution of the emerging line intensities with the telescope beam pattern has been done taking into account the characteristics of 30m iram radio telescope ( see section 2 ) and those of the 14m fcrao antenna . for the latter",
    "we have used a hpbw of 54  at 91 ghz and a beam efficiency of 0.51 .",
    "nevertheless , the error beam size for the fcrao antenna is not known but must be taken into account . in our modeling , we arbitrarily assume a size of 180  . as quoted above , the radial intensity profile enables to constrain the way density and abundance vary through the cloud .",
    "we stress that the density profiles determined in the following section depend essentially on the observations of the @xmath0=10 line .",
    "hence , an accurate description of the radiation pattern of the fcrao antenna is needed to obtain the best estimates for the physical parameters of the clouds .",
    "we have checked the effect of introducing different error beam sizes for the fcrao antenna , and the largest differences are obtained when the error beam is not taken into account , which leads to @xmath0=10 line intensities 2030% lower for the same physical conditions and source structure . this effect could be compensated by increasing the size of the central core , r@xmath15 , by 510  , decreasing its density , n@xmath15 , and increasing the abundance of n@xmath1h@xmath2 in the outer region of the clouds .    for some sources",
    ", we have included infall velocity fields in order to reproduce the spectral features seen in the @xmath0=21 line .",
    "the profiles used consist of a @xmath19 function which corresponds to infalling cores for all sources , except for l1517b . despite the inclusion of these velocity fields , we have observed frequency offsets between the observations and the models . in table",
    "[ table : vlsr ] , we report the v@xmath20 determined from our @xmath0=10 data , the corrections to this value for the other lines ( v@xmath20 and corrections are determined by a @xmath21 square fitting ) , and the velocity gradient found in the sources .",
    "for all of them , we find that the @xmath0=21 and @xmath0=32 lines have v@xmath20 @xmath22 30 m s@xmath23 larger than the v@xmath20 of the @xmath0=10 line .",
    "this would be consistent with the view of a static core with an infalling envelope as the @xmath0=21 and @xmath0=32 lines arise from the densest part of the cloud .",
    "however , we think that the effect , 20 and 30 khz for the @xmath0=21 and @xmath0=32 lines respectively , is within the accuracy of the laboratory frequencies of n@xmath1h@xmath2 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "consequently , the range of model parameters is limited by the laboratory accuracy in the frequencies .      in this section ,",
    "the cloud physical parameters ( see tables [ table : models ] and [ table : models2 ] ) , obtained from the modeling of our data , are discussed . in the following discussion ,",
    "we use the notation @xmath24",
    "@xmath25 x(n@xmath1d@xmath2)/x(n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) to refer to the isotopologues abundance ratio .",
    "this quantity differs from the column density ratio ( referred to as @xmath26 @xmath25 n(n@xmath1d@xmath2)/n(n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) ) in the case of three clouds ( l63 , tmc2 and the two molecular peaks in l183 ) for which @xmath24 has been found to change with radius .",
    "r represents in all cases an averaged value along the line of sight of the n@xmath1h@xmath2 volume density .    for each cloud ,",
    "the error bars quoted for the physical parameters are derived by use of a reduced @xmath27 .",
    "these are obtained by assuming that the parameters of the models are independent and thus , it does not account for the correlation among them .",
    "nevertheless , it gives an indication on the sensitivity of the emerging spectra to the model s parameters .",
    "the same criterion was used for both n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 spectra . the uncertainty on @xmath24",
    "is then found important due to the lower signal to noise ratio of the n@xmath1d@xmath2 data and this leads to large error bars for the n@xmath1d@xmath2 column density ( varying from 20% to 100% depending on the source ) while typically , the n@xmath1h@xmath2 column density is estimated with an accuracy of 10 - 20 % .      modeled lines and observations of the @xmath0=10 and @xmath0=21 transitions of n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 are shown on figure [ graph : l1517b ] . when comparing the line profiles of the two isotopologues , it is important to note the differences which are introduced by their respective abundances , i.e. opacities .",
    "we see that the intensity ratio between the different @xmath0=10 hyperfine components are best reproduced for n@xmath1d@xmath2 which is optically thinner than n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "this fact supports the idea that hyperfine intensity anomalies are due to radiative effects which occur at high opacities . for the @xmath0=21 lines of the two isotopologues , we see that the main central emission component is self absorbed for n@xmath1h@xmath2 while it is not for n@xmath1d@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , as commented in , the line profile seen in the @xmath0=21 line of n@xmath1h@xmath2 is characteristic of expanding flows .",
    "a detailed study of l1517b has been reported in @xcite where the structure of the cloud is derived from maps of the nh@xmath7 inversion line and 1.2 mm continuum emission .",
    "the position we observed corresponds to the n@xmath1h@xmath2 peak intensity given by @xcite , which is situated at ( + 15,+15  ) of the n@xmath1h@xmath2 emission peak in the higher resolution map reported by @xcite .",
    "the latter position is also a maximum of the 1.2 mm emission map . in our models we took into account the @xmath0=10 and @xmath0=32 lines reported by @xcite towards the continuum peak . on figure [ graph : int_rad ]",
    ", we compare the @xmath0=10 radial integrated intensity of our model to the observational data reported in the latter study .",
    "to characterize the velocity structure of l1517b , we introduced a linear outward gradient of 1.4 km s@xmath23 pc@xmath23 for radii beyond 20  .",
    "as pointed out in , it is rather difficult to constrain velocity fields from observations of the @xmath0=10 and @xmath0=32 lines of n@xmath1h@xmath2 , while the larger opacity of the @xmath0=21 line enables a better estimate . from observations of cs emission lines , @xcite derived a value for the outward gradient of 2 km s@xmath23 pc@xmath23 , for radii larger than @xmath22 70  .",
    "hence , this velocity field is consistent with their observations of the @xmath0=10 and @xmath0=32 lines of n@xmath1h@xmath2 observed towards the central position .    on figure [ graph : int_rad ]",
    ", we compare the @xmath0=10 radial intensities obtained with two types of density profiles .",
    "the first is the one quoted above ( labeled ( 1 ) in table [ table : models ] ) and the second corresponds to the phenomenological profile used by @xcite ( labeled as ( 2 ) ) . using the profile ( 2 )",
    ", we obtain the same estimate than in the latter study , i.e. n@xmath15 = 2.0 10@xmath6 cm @xmath28 and r@xmath15 = 35  .",
    "moreover , we see that with the present observational data , we are rather insensitive to the exact form of the function which describes the density variations in the cloud , since the two density profiles give similar results for both line shapes and the @xmath0=10 integrated intensity profile .    using the two density profiles mentioned above , we also derive different estimates for the n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance , i.e. 1.6 10@xmath29 with ( 1 ) and 2.5 10@xmath29 with ( 2 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "our estimate is higher by @xmath22 70% with respect to the one obtained by @xcite , i.e. x(n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) = 1.5 10@xmath29 .",
    "the difference is due to the use of different sets of collisional rate coefficients in each studies .    we have determined the d / h ratio that allows to reproduce the @xmath0=21 line of n@xmath1d@xmath2 for the two density profiles . for the density profile ( 1 ) , we derive r = 0.12@xmath30 which is a factor 2 higher than the estimate of 0.06 @xmath31 0.01 obtained by @xcite toward the density peak position .",
    "@xcite have estimated a mass of 0.33 m@xmath32 within a radius of 1.4 , which corresponds to a mean volume density of n(h@xmath1)=6 10@xmath33 @xmath4 .",
    "for the same radius , we obtain a mass of 2.5 m@xmath32 . on the other hand , the analysis of emission maps at 850 @xmath34 m and 450 @xmath34 m @xcite lead to an estimate of n(h@xmath1 ) @xmath22 45 10@xmath6 @xmath4 , in qualitative agreement with the central density assessed from our n@xmath1h@xmath2 data .",
    "l183 is a well studied object due to its proximity ( d=110 pc ) .",
    "it has a non spherical shape with a north  south axis in the density distribution .",
    "recent studies point out a complex chemistry in the cloud , with four main molecular peaks showing characteristics which are interpreted as signs of different stages of evolution @xcite .",

    "for all the other clouds for which we have obtained enclosed masses greater than 5 m@xmath32 within 2 , the n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance decreases in the outermost regions .",

    "an increase of the temperature with radius allows to minimize self absorption effects in the @xmath0=21 line .    in our sample ,",

    ". nevertheless , when using other molecules , the differences in density estimates are more important .",
    "part of the discrepancies may arise from the different spatial distribution within the clouds of each molecule .",
    "some of them , such as co or cs , are known to undergo depletion in the highest density regions and an analysis which assumes a uniform density would lead to a lower value for the cloud density . for the studies based on nh@xmath7 , the differences are yet unclear since both molecules seem to be present in the same regions of the clouds , as shown by the corresponding emission maps . for the comparison with the estimates done in @xcite , a source of discrepancy could be the larger hpbw ( @xmath22 80 \" ) of the haystack antenna used in the latter work .",
    "another possibility explaining the lower density estimates derived from nh@xmath7 lines may come from the low critical densities of the ( j , k)=(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines , i.e. n@xmath52 @xmath22 10@xmath44 @xmath4 .",
    "since for the densities of the inner regions of the dense cores , these lines are thermalized , an accurate determination of the kinetic temperature and nh@xmath7 column density is still possible while the lines are rather insensitive to the density .",
    "moreover , the densities estimated from n@xmath1h@xmath2 and millimeter continuum observations lead to nh@xmath7 line intensities consistent with the observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this points out the low sensitivity of the nh@xmath7 inversion lines to dense gas , and the difficulty to assess the dense core gas density uniquely from nh@xmath7 observations .",
    "finally , we obtain that the mass derived for the clouds are in general in good agreement with the estimates obtained from mm or sub  mm emission analysis and higher than the mass derived from the observations of other molecular species .",
    "note , that the rate coefficients used in this work are calculated for collisions with he . as discussed in @xcite for the case of hco@xmath2 ( isoelectronic of n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) , the larger polarizability of h@xmath1 compared to he induces strong variations in the corresponding potential energy surfaces .",
    "it entails that the cross sections obtained for hco@xmath2h@xmath1 are greater by a factor 23 compared to the hco@xmath2he ones . in the present work ,",
    "the collisional rate coefficients are corrected for the difference in the reduced masses of h@xmath1 and he in the boltzmann average .",
    "this is a crude approximation which assumes that cross sections for collisions with he and h@xmath1 are similar .",
    "thus , we expect to obtain significant differences , by analogy with the hco@xmath2 case , for the collisional rates of n@xmath1h@xmath2 with h@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the results obtained have to be regarded with caution and the error on the density and abundance estimates could be as large as a factor 2 .",
    "the models presented for l1517b and l1498 can serve as a benchmark for the typical variations that we expect using different collisional rate coefficients . compared to the abundances reported in @xcite , the values we have derived in this work are within 5070% .    from n@xmath1d@xmath2 lines ,",
    "we have derived values for the d / h enrichment in each cloud which are in reasonable agreement with previous determinations , despite the fact that the methods used are often different . in addition , for three of the studied clouds ( l63 , tmc2 and the two cores in l183 ) , we find that the d / h ratio takes high values ( 0.50.7 ) in the inner part of the cloud and decreases in the lower density outer regions .",
    "such characteristics are expected from theoretical models which couple the dynamics and chemistry of molecular clouds @xcite . moreover",
    ", these models predict that a quantitative determination of the deuterium enrichment could probe the evolutionary stage of the collapse .",
    "the present analysis of the line profiles of n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 has allowed to derive the profile and temperature dependences together with the overall deuterium fractionation ratio in the various selected pre  stellar cores .",
    "looking at table [ table : models2 ] , one may notice that the deduced total column density of n@xmath1h@xmath2 varies within a factor of 2 whereas the deuterated counterpart abundance may vary by factors larger than 6 , which leads to fractionation values between 0.07 and 0.5 .",
    "a detailed chemical discussion on the deuterium fractionation derived from the present observations is beyond the scope of the present paper and we only want to derive some general trends from the observations .",
    "the presence of molecular ions in interstellar environments is readily explained by a succession of ion molecule reactions initiated by cosmic ray ( cr ) ionization of molecular hydrogen : h@xmath1 + cr @xmath53 h@xmath54 ; h@xmath1 + h@xmath54 @xmath53 h@xmath55 + h. the h@xmath55 molecular ion is an efficient proton donor and reacts with saturated stable molecules such as co , n@xmath1 , hd to produce hco@xmath2 , n@xmath1h@xmath2 , h@xmath1d@xmath2 .",

    "high fractionation ratios such as those found in the studied environments are then directly correlated to high deuteration fractions of the deuterated h@xmath55 ions which can occur in highly depleted environments @xcite .",
    "in addition to these reactions , n@xmath1d@xmath2 ( dco@xmath2 ) may also be formed in the deuteron exchange reaction between d atoms and n@xmath1h@xmath2 ( hco@xmath2 ) .",

    "the deduced fractional abundances of n@xmath1h@xmath2 , which are of the order of 10@xmath29 compared to h@xmath1 , imply a first constraint on the depletions , i.e. the available abundances of the elements in the gas phase .",
    "the deuterium fractionation ratio brings an additional limit on these values and also on other physical parameters such as the cosmic ray ionization rate ( @xmath57 ) which is directly related to the ionization fraction .",
    "steady state model calculations allow to span rapidly the parameters space and to obtain the main physical and chemical characteristics of the environment .",

    "for some test cases , we have introduced these new branching ratios , by keeping the same value of the total destruction rate of n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 and we have found that the fractional abundances of n@xmath1h@xmath2 , n@xmath1d@xmath2 as well as the fractionation ratio remain very similar to the one displayed on figure [ graph : chimie ] . however , substantial changes are found for hydrogenated nitrogen molecules and their isotopologues such as nh , nh@xmath1 , ... ] which modify considerably the chemical composition of the gas . we mimic the various mechanisms involved in gas - grain interactions ( accretion , thermal desorption , cosmic - ray induced desorption , etc ... ) by introducing a dependence of the available gas phase elemental abundances with density .",

    "the values correspond to the abundances observed in diffuse and translucent environments .",

    "n , o and s are in the range of several 10@xmath62 - 10@xmath63 , corresponding to depletions of 10 - 100 .",
    "we solve the charge balance on the grains and allow the atomic ions to neutralize on the mostly negatively charged grains .",
    "these processes are important for the overall ionization fraction of the gas and lead to very low ionization fraction of the order of 10@xmath64 for densities larger than 10@xmath6 @xmath4 .",

    "two @xmath57 values are used to probe the role of this important physical parameter .",
    "we see that the obtained results span very nicely the values derived from the observations . to model the n@xmath1h@xmath2 emission",
    ", it has been assumed that the density structure was consisting on a power law .",
    "we thus derived that observed spectra were consistent with an increase of the temperature with radius , and that , depending on the source , the n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance was whether constant or decreasing outward .",
    "considering the two @xmath57 values assumed we find that the trend derived from the modeling is qualitatively reproduced with @xmath65 s@xmath23 . on the other hand , for a higher @xmath57 value , the abundance would tend to increase with radius .",
    "the models done in section [ clouds ] show that the n@xmath1d@xmath2/n@xmath1h@xmath2 ratio could reach values as high as 0.5 in the innermost regions of the clouds .",
    "figure [ graph : chimie ] shows that chemistry predict a n@xmath1d@xmath2/n@xmath1h@xmath2 ratio greater than 0.1 for densities higher than 23 @xmath66 @xmath4 , with maximum values of 0.20.3 .",
    "while the maximum values derived from the chemical modeling and from observations are within a factor 2 , the trend derived for the ratio , in both cases , are in good agreement .",
    "actually , for four sources ( l63 , tmc2 , and the two dense cores of l183 ) , we obtained from observations that the ratio should decrease rapidly with density , a trend reproduced in the chemical modeling .",
    "note that both absolute abundances and abundances ratio have been found to be sensitive to the adopted depletion law .",
    "in contrast , figure [ graph : chimie ] shows that the n@xmath1d@xmath2/n@xmath1h@xmath2 ratio is rather insensitive to variations of the temperature or cosmic ray constant , while the n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 absolute abundances are strongly changed .",
    "we consider here only gas phase processes so that the role of induced desorption by cosmic rays is assumed to be constant within the variation by a factor of 5 of the cosmic ray ionization rate value .",
    "a variation of @xmath57 changes both the abundances of h@xmath55 isotopologues and of the electrons , which are involved respectively in the main n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 formation and destruction routes .",
    "the larger efficiency of formation from h@xmath55 isotopologues entails that the absolute abundances increase with @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the formation and destruction channels of n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 lead to nearly equal variations , both with the temperature and @xmath57 , which explains why the isotopologues abundances ratio remain identical .",
    "finally , we point out that the n@xmath1d@xmath2/n@xmath1h@xmath2 ratio could serve as a probe of the way the c , n , o and s containing species deplete onto grains , since other parameters such as temperature and the cosmic ray ionization rate just influence the isotopologues absolute abundances similarly .",
    "figure [ graph : chimie ] shows the n@xmath1d@xmath2/n@xmath1h@xmath2 ratio derived from the full chemical network in comparison to the ratio expected from statistical considerations ( i.e. equation [ statistical ] ) .",
    "we find a reasonable agreement between the two ratio , the largest differences ( for t = 15k and @xmath67 s@xmath23 ) being of the order of 60% .",
    "the largest values in the full modeling are due to an increased n@xmath1d@xmath2 formation through the deuterium exchange reaction between d atoms and n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "for some specific conditions , this formation route is found efficient .",
    "we have derived estimates of the temperature , density , n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 abundances in a sample of cold dark clouds , by using a radiative transfer modeling which enables to interpret the hyperfine transitions of these molecules .",
    "the main conclusions are :    1 .   compared to previous studies considering n@xmath1h@xmath2",
    ", we generally derive higher densities due to the inclusion in the models of the @xmath0=21 line . for the conditions prevailing in dark clouds , i.e. t@xmath68 @xmath22 10 k , this line is the optically thickest and , in order to prevent strong self absorption effects which are generally not observed , models with high density and low abundance are preferred .",
    "moreover , an outward increase of the temperature enables to reduce the self absorption in this line .",
    "2 .   in order to reproduce the @xmath0=10 hyperfine transitions ,",
    "the total opacity of this line has to be larger than @xmath69 @xmath22 10 .",
    "a way to increase the opacity and to still reproduce the other rotational lines is to decrease the temperature in the inner core below t = 10 k. for most sources , we encounter a good agreement with a temperature around t = 8 k in the central region of the clouds .",
    "we analyzed the density structure of the clouds and we took into account previous studies where the @xmath0=10 integrated intensity , as a function of the position on the cloud , were reported .",
    "the central average densities and the radii of the inner flat regions , derived using n@xmath1h@xmath2 , are in good agreement with the equivalent parameters obtained from sub  mm and mm continuum observations . compared to other studies based on other molecular species , it seems that n@xmath1h@xmath2 is the only one which allows such a good agreement , since other molecules provide systematically lower h@xmath1 volume densities . for most molecules ,",
    "it still might be possible to conciliate these estimates by introducing the radial dependence in the molecular abundances which are predicted by theoretical studies of dark clouds chemistry .",
    "4 .   we derive x(n@xmath1d@xmath2)/x(n@xmath1h@xmath2 ) which are in qualitatively good agreement with previous studies .",
    "moreover , for two of the studied clouds ( tmc2 and l183 ) where we have observed various positions in the cloud , we find that the observed spectra are best reproduced when increasing the d / h ratio in the inner dense regions .",
    "we note that for these 2 objects a single position analysis lead to the derivation of a constant ratio throughout the cloud , which was smaller than the central value obtained in the multi position analysis .",
    "thus , for the other objects , the ratio we have derived has to be considered as an average value and a central enhancement of the d / h ratio can not be ruled out . + considering studies that deal with the chemical evolution of protostellar clouds , our results are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the expected trend of the two isotopologues @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of the multideuterated species of h@xmath70 in the chemical network was pointed out by @xcite in order to explain the high deuterium fractionation observed in molecular clouds .",
    "this work shows that for various molecular species we should observe d / h ratios approaching unity .",
    "moreover , they show that the deuterium fractionation is particularly efficient in the case of n@xmath1h@xmath2 . a detailed time dependent study considering both dynamics and chemistry was reported in @xcite for the stages prior to star formation .",
    "it confirms that deuterium fractionation can reach high values for n@xmath1h@xmath2 and that the abundance ratio takes larger values in the innermost regions of the clouds . from this latter study",
    ", it appears that the fractionation is expected to increase with time when the central density of the inner region increases .",

    "the lower einstein a coefficients and higher upwards rate coefficients for n@xmath1d@xmath2 with respect to n@xmath1h@xmath2 allow the high  j rotational levels to be more efficiently populated for the deuterated species .",

    "this behavior applies to the whole range of densities explored in our calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the change in the critical density is only apparent for the @xmath0=10 line ( see t@xmath74 panel of figure [ graph : lvg_isotope ] ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an exact determination of these ratios should take into account the different cloud emitting volumes for these species .",
    "the implication for chemical models is obvious since a direct comparison of the derived column densities will always produce higher deuteration factors than the real ones .",

    "<S> this confirms that n@xmath1h@xmath2 depletion is not very efficient in dark clouds for densities as large as 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , and also points out that a simultaneous analysis based on mm continuum , n@xmath1h@xmath2 and n@xmath1d@xmath2 observations should lead to reliable estimates for the temperature and density structure of cold dark clouds .    from multi  </S>",
