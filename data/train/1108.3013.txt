    "hubbard models are extremely successful in describing a variety of systems ranging from electrons in solids to bosonic quantum gases in optical lattices . while in solids all kinds of complex lattice systems",
    "are realized , optical lattices offer simple geometries in combination with precisely controllable experimental conditions . the striking idea",
    "that ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices constitute an excellent tool for studying the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xcite has initiated an intensive investigation of bosonic lattice models .",
    "it has caused a large number of theoretical studies on the bose - hubbard model ranging from mean - field treatments @xcite and quantum monte carlo @xcite to dmrg @xcite approaches .",
    "in addition , the influence of disorder @xcite and the effect of confining potentials have been discussed @xcite .",
    "however , the first - order corrections to the bose - hubbard model itself , namely higher orbital tunneling ( fig .",
    "1a ) and bond - charge interactions ( fig .  1b ) , have",
    "so far been mostly neglected in these approaches .",
    "bond - charge interactions known from solids @xcite constitute a density - induced tunneling process caused by the scattering of particles on neighboring sites .",
    "this extension to the hubbard model was discussed in the context of superconductivity @xcite and ferromagnetism @xcite . while for fermionic systems",
    "these effects are partly suppressed due to the pauli principle , they have large impact on bosonic systems .",
    "the unique experimental access in optical lattices allows for a detailed investigation of this interaction - assisted tunneling .",
    "this density - dependent hopping was recently also discussed for boson - fermion mixtures @xcite , where the bose - fermi - hubbard model does not fully cover effects arising from the interspecies interaction @xcite . in this context , the role of higher orbitals for the tunneling processes @xcite was investigated .",
    "for bosonic systems , modifications of tunneling and on - site interaction due to higher bands were studied by variational mean - field methods @xcite and by numerical exact methods restricted either to double- or triple - well systems @xcite or to the on - site interaction @xcite .",
    "however , in the correlated regime present at the vicinity of the mott - insulator transition the applicability of mean - field methods to describe higher - band processes is doubtful .",
    "thus , the challenging problem is to find a comprehensive description including both bond - charge hopping @xcite and higher band processes @xcite that is valid also for strongly correlated systems .",
    "the recent experimental progress in accessing the occupation - dependent on - site interactions @xcite and the tunneling matrix element @xcite requests for an accurate theoretical method to calculate these parameters .",
    "furthermore , the superfluid to mott - insulator transition in experiments with tunable interactions @xcite is directly affected by bond - charge tunneling as well as multi - orbital extensions to conventional and bond - charge tunneling .     ]    here , we show that interaction - induced processes cause two substantial modifications of the bose - hubbard model for bosonic atoms in three - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "first , so - called bond - charge or density - induced tunneling combining interaction and hopping ( fig .",
    "1b ) is a notable contribution to tunneling .",
    "second , higher bands are occupied due to the interaction of particles on a lattice site .",
    "this increases the tunneling significantly as the tunneling in higher bands ( fig .",
    "1a ) is strongly enhanced .",
    "we present a general scheme to calculate renormalized tunneling processes by effectively incorporating higher - band contributions . on this basis",
    ", we derive an effective occupation - dependent model where the renormalization solely depends on the solution of the on - site problem . the well - known phase diagram for bosons in lattices describing the superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator",
    "( mi ) transition is drastically altered .",
    "the presented results have direct relevance for optical lattice experiments , which can therefore serve as an ideal testing ground for beyond hubbard physics .    after presenting the resulting phase diagram in section [ sec : pd ] , we discuss the extensions of the hubbard model individually starting with the effect of bond - charge interactions in section [ bci ] .",
    "the multi - orbital renormalization of the operators for conventional tunneling , bond - charge tunneling and on - site interaction is elaborated in sections 4 - 7 .",
    "the basic idea is to separate the strongly - correlated on - site problem from the inter - site dynamics .",
    "first , we solve the on - site problem numerically exactly using the wannier states of the lattice .",
    "subsequently , we derive renormalized matrix elements for the multi - orbitally dressed operators .",
    "finally , we calculate the phase diagram by treating the many - site problem with mean - field theory in section [ mfgw ] .",
    "note that the multi - orbital renormalization can be used for various methods to treat the many - site problem and that the results are expected to be similarly affected .",
    "we now first explain as one central result the phase diagram for bosonic atoms ( fig .  [ pd ] ) which is derived and further discussed afterwards .",
    "the black lines depict the mott lobes predicted by the single - band bose - hubbard model applying mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "our calculations ( colored lines ) take into account the corrections to the tunneling as mentioned above as well as multi - orbital modifications of the on - site interaction .",
    "the phase diagrams are obtained for bosonic atoms of arbitrary species in cubic sinusoidal optical lattices with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the lattice spacing and @xmath3 the lattice depth .",
    "we predict that the phase area of the mott insulator is considerably reduced even for moderate interaction strengths and substantially deformed for stronger interactions .",
    "this corresponds to a significant shift of the critical lattice depth of the sf - mi transition ( fig .",
    "[ vc ] ) due to an effectively increased tunneling and reduced on - site interaction .",
    "the discrepancy can reach more than @xmath4 for @xmath5 particles per lattice site .",
    "we expect the shift to be observable in experiments with a filling @xmath6 and strong or tunable interactions .        the mentioned extension to the hubbard model leading to the phase diagram in fig .  [ pd ] ( red and blue lines )",
    "can be included in an _ effective _ hamiltonian @xmath7 with _ multi - orbitally renormalized _ creation and annihilation operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and the operator @xmath10 corresponding to the number of particles on site @xmath11 .",
    "this hamiltonian has the same structure as the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite but with multi - orbitally renormalized tunneling matrix elements @xmath12 and on - site interactions @xmath13 that explicitly depend on the site occupation @xmath14 . in the following ,",
    "we calculate these occupation - dependent parameters with exact diagonalization and derive the phase boundaries using a mean - field ( mf ) and a gutzwiller ( gw ) approach .",
    "furthermore , we present a simplified hamiltonian with _ occupation - independent _ parameters ( green lines in fig .  [ pd ] ) which is in good agreement with the full model above .",
    "this hamiltonian is restricted to conventional and bond - charge tunneling in the lowest - band @xmath15        + \\frac{\\tilde u_2}{2 } \\sum_i \\hat n_i ( \\hat n_i-1)\\ ] ] with single - band operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the hubbard tunneling @xmath18 , lowest - band bond - charge interaction @xmath19 and renormalized on - site interaction @xmath20 for two particles , as is elaborated in detail below .",
    "in general , the results for hamiltonian show that the lowest - band bond - charge tunneling is an important contribution and its influence increases with the number of particles per site .",
    "note that the mean - field and gutzwiller approach fully coincide for occupation - independent models ( green and black lobes ) , whereas there is a minimal discrepancy for the hamiltonian with occupation - dependent tunneling . in the mean - field calculation ,",
    "the decoupling of the lattice sites requires the use of @xmath21 as an approximation for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see [ appendixmeanfield ] and g ) .",
    "the two - particle interaction of bosonic particles in the lowest band of the lattice is given by @xmath24 with interaction integrals @xmath25 and wannier functions @xmath26 of the lowest band , which are maximally localized at site @xmath11 . here , a @xmath27-interaction potential with repulsive interactions @xmath28 is assumed .",
    "one of the key ingredients of the hubbard model @xcite is to restrict the two - particle interaction to the dominating term , namely , the on - site interaction @xmath29 .",
    "however , some of the neglected off - site processes correspond to scattering accompanied by hopping to a neighboring site ( e.g. , @xmath30 ) known as bond - charge tunneling ( fig .",
    "it is essential that this process constitutes a hopping process which physically modifies the overall tunneling in the system .",

    "considering two neighboring sites @xmath11 and @xmath32 , the density - induced tunneling operator takes the form @xmath33 and @xmath34 . due to the structure of this operator , we can combine it with the conventional tunneling @xmath18 to an effective hopping @xmath35 \\hat{b}^{\\dagger}_i \\hat{b}_j.\\ ] ] as a consequence , the total tunneling increase is of the order of several ten percent for standard @xmath36rb - conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ j ] , dashed line ) and even more for stronger interactions and deeper lattices . note that density - density off - site interactions ( @xmath37 ) @xcite and correlated pair tunneling ( @xmath38 ) are considerably weaker than the bond - charge interactions ( see [ appendixoffsite ] ) .",

    "we can write the effective hopping operator   as @xmath41 we can now identify the expression @xmath42 as an effective tunneling potential which is illustrated in fig .  [ j]c .",
    "since the density of the repulsively interacting particles is localized at the centers of the lattice sites , the effective potential corresponds to a shallower lattice , i.e. , increased tunneling .",
    "note that the effective potential can be used to determine the total tunneling via band structure calculations ( see [ appendixeffectivepotential ] ) .",

    "while the extension to the hubbard model above is still within the lowest - band approximation , the following discussion covers the influence of higher orbitals .",
    "the calculation of the effective tunneling can be performed by taking two adjacent sites of the lattices into account ( fig .",
    "writing initial and final states as a product of wave functions of the two sites allows to express the renormalized tunneling in terms of single - site expectation values .",
    "consequently , the renormalized parameters depend only on the solution of the single - site problem .",
    "the presented scheme allows to derive the effective hamiltonian independently of the applied method for treating the on - site many - particle problem . here ,",
    "the orbital occupations are computed by exact diagonalization of @xmath50 particles on a single site using a finite many - particle basis with a high - energy cut - off .",
    "the short - range interaction between the atoms is modeled as a box - shaped interaction potential ( see [ appendixmodel ] for details ) .",

    "the total tunneling @xmath55 becomes intrinsically occupation - dependent .",

    "consequently , tunneling can only occur in even orbitals @xmath68 with positive tunneling matrix elements @xmath49 .",
    "it turns out that the effective tunneling is increased by the tunneling in higher bands with the exception of the processes @xmath138 .",
    "here , the lack of interaction in the left or the right site prohibits tunneling via higher bands .",
    "the interaction at one site , however , depopulates the fock state @xmath139 which results in slightly lowered tunneling energy . the process @xmath140 , where no interactions are present , is equivalent to the uncorrelated tunneling @xmath141 .",

    ", the total tunneling can be written as @xmath176 in this integral , @xmath177 can be replaced by @xmath178 with the density @xmath179 of all particles in the lattice , since the wannier functions are localized .",
    "finally , we can identify the effect of the bond - charge interaction as a normal tunneling within the effective potential @xmath180 experienced by the hopping particle ( see fig .",
    "[ j]c , main text ) .",
    "however , since @xmath181 , one may also define @xmath182 . in this case , the effective potential for a homogeneous filling @xmath183 can be written as @xmath184 .",
    "this form of the potential can be used to perform a band structure calculation in the effective potential @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in general the effective potential is not separable into its spatial directions .",
    "furthermore , in a band structure calculus the wannier functions are adapted to the effective potential whereas in eq .",
    "the wannier functions of the bare lattice potential are used .",
    "the full hamiltonian including the bond - charge interaction as well as the multi - orbital corrections to the tunneling , bond - charge and on - site interactions reads @xmath185 ( see eq .  1 , main text ) , where @xmath186 denotes nearest - neighbor tunneling and @xmath187 is the chemical potential .",
    "the hopping in the renormalized multi - orbital basis is described by @xmath188 , while @xmath189 corresponds to the number of particles on site @xmath11 . in order to apply mean - field theory",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we introduce the superfluid order parameter @xmath89 , where @xmath190 corresponds to the superfluid phase ( sf ) and @xmath191 defines the mott insulator ( mi ) with a fixed number of atoms per lattice site .",
    "the decoupling of the lattice sites is achieved by neglecting the fluctuations between @xmath192 and @xmath193 of quadratic order , i.e. , @xmath194 however , the occupation - number dependent tunneling parameter still couples the sites and it is necessary to approximate @xmath195 which corresponds to substituting @xmath196 and @xmath23 by @xmath21 .",
    "this is necessary , as the fluctuations are described by a single parameter @xmath197 , which has no internal structure that would allow for the implementation of an occupation - dependent tunneling amplitude .",
    "this can be circumvented by using the gutzwiller approach , where the information on the population of the individual fock states is preserved ( see [ appendixgutzwiller ] ) .",
    "however , we find that this approximation causes only small deviations .",
    "analogously , we neglect quadratic fluctuations in the bond - charge term between neighboring lattices sites . disregarding terms of the order @xmath198 we find @xmath199 we perform second - order perturbation theory in @xmath197 of a mott lobe with @xmath50 particles per site and",
    "thus restrict the tunneling to the symmetric terms @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",

    "in the mean - field approach elaborated above , only the tunneling matrix elements @xmath211 and @xmath212 are taken into account due to the decoupling approximation . using a gutzwiller approach @xcite ,",
    "the full occupation - dependent hamiltonian can be evaluated without this restriction . in this approach ,",
    "the trial wave function @xmath213 with coefficients @xmath94 is used , which assumes that the wave function at each site @xmath11 can be written as a sum of local fock states . in a homogeneous lattice with @xmath214 sites ,",
    "all sites are equivalent and we can write @xmath215 . the hamiltonian can be split into four parts , namely , @xmath216 the expectation values for this hamiltonian , depending exclusively on the expectation values for two adjacent sites @xmath11 and @xmath32 , are given by @xmath217 @xmath218 @xmath219 @xmath220 with @xmath204 nearest neighbors .",
    "the system is in a mott - insulator state , when all fluctuations vanishes , i.e. , when @xmath221 is the energetically lowest state .",
    "the resulting gutzwiller phase diagram is plotted together with the mean - field results in fig .  1 in the main text .",
