    "it is a well known that hard x - rays originate from regions very close to black holes ( chakrabarti & titarchuk , 1995 , hereafter ct95 ) .",
    "thus , the effects of photon bending ( luminet , 1979 ; weinberg , 1972 ) are of major importance .",
    "furthermore , a power - law tail produced by the bulk motion comptonization from regions between the inner sonic point and the horizon is expected to be dominated by such effects .",
    "we solve 3d photon trajectory equations ( weinberg 1972 ) to trace the path of each ray from the emission region to the observer plane . in ct95 ,",
    "major components are the geometrically thin keplerian disk in the pre - shock flow and geometrically thick torus or cenbol is the post - shock region .",
    "images of optically thick keplerian disk and thick accretion disk ( chakrabarti , 1985 ) are developed separately . in future , these will be merged and the composite spectra will be showed .      in four dimensions ,",
    "the motion of free particles or photons are governed by the following equation , @xmath0 with @xmath1 $ ] ; @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is our affine parameter and @xmath7 is christoffel symbols .",
    "expanding equation @xmath8 , we get @xmath9 coupled differential equations of second order . specific energy @xmath10 and specific angular momentum @xmath11 are two physical quantities which characterizes a trajectory ( chandrasekhar 1983 ) .",
    "since , the path of a photon are is guided by it s energy , we can consider @xmath12 which will be modified later by flux equation .",
    "however , @xmath13 is a variable which changes impact parameters as defined by @xmath14 ( luminet 1979 ) .",
    "this condition allows us to drop one equation by substituting the derivative from affine parameter @xmath15 to time @xmath16 co - ordinate .",
    "thus we get in schwarzschild geometry as : @xmath17 we have three second order coupled differential equations which govern the path of a photon in this curved geometry .",
    "three spatial velocity components are @xmath18 the set of six ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) initial conditions are supplied to solve this set of equations .",
    "to generate spectrum and image one must introduce the concept of redshift .",
    "there are two contributors of the redshift .",
    "one comes from the doppler effect caused by rotational motion of the disk and another is gravitational redshift caused by the black hole .",
    "so , redshift can be written as : @xmath25 where , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are gravitational and rotational contributions . by definition ,",
    "redshift z is : @xmath28 where , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are energy of emitted and observed photons .",
    "taking and inner product of 4-momentum and 4-velocity gives the energy of emitted photon as @xmath31 where @xmath32 . from earlier definition , @xmath33 ( for keplerian disk @xmath34 ) known as the projection of impact parameter along the z - axis",
    "so , like luminet ( 1979 ) , we consider the final form of redshift as @xmath35,\\ ] ] where , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we use the time averaged radiation profile given by page and thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "bolometric flux from a keplerian disk is written as @xmath38,\\ ] ]    where , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the disk accretion rate in eddington unit .",
    "we keep @xmath41 throughout our simulation for keplerian disk .",
    "this is the flux emitted from source .",
    "observed flux and emitted flux relation is given by , @xmath42 fourth power in the redshift factor comes due to the energy loss of photons ( one power ) , gravitational time dilation ( one power ) and relativistic correction of detector solid angle ( two powers ) .",
    "the maximum observed flux is located at @xmath43 with @xmath44 . from stefan - boltzmann law , one can easily get observed temperature of disk by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    to correlate energy and temperature we used wien s displacement law .",
    "temperature is associated with the radius .",
    "so , the obtained most probable frequency will be related to the temperature via @xmath47 .",
    "basic process of generating thick disks involves a suitable solution of euler equation which is given by @xmath48 where , p is pressure and @xmath49 is total energy density . also , @xmath50 is specific angular momentum and @xmath51 is the relativistic angular momentum . if we choose barotropic process @xmath52 , then constant pressure surfaces and equipotential surfaces coincides . under such condition ,",
    "euler equation becomes @xmath53 where , for a given von zeipel relation , one can easily integrate the third term of this equation .",
    "of course , making @xmath54 is one easier solution .",
    "this type of distribution is effective for the open curves where matter falls onto black hole without transporting angular momentum . when advection is added , the closed curves open up ( chakrabarti 1993 ) .",
    "we use a generalized von zeipel relationship , @xmath55 from chakrabarti ( 1985 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 has dimension @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "choosing @xmath58 ( chakrabarti 1985 ) , where c and n are constants , yields the von zeipel relationship as follows @xmath59    from this , one can obtain all the variations such as 1 .",
    "@xmath60 for @xmath61 ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1978 ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath62 for @xmath63 for constant c ( kozlowski et al . 1978 ) and many more by using different values of n. the rigid body rotation condition is satisfied using @xmath64 .",
    "constant parameters c and n can be derived from @xmath65  and  @xmath66 where , the subscripts @xmath67 and @xmath68 correspond for the disk inner edge and center of the disk .",
    "thermodynamical properties , such as temperature , pressure and density inside the thick disk were calculated by using chakrabarti et al .",
    "we take keplerian disk with uniform particle density . radiation from disk particles",
    "are isotropic in nature .",
    "they are moving in time like circular orbits with no radial velocity .",
    "keplerian angular velocity of disk particles is given as @xmath69 .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    observational results suggest that there are time lead or lag between high and low energy photons which led us to study time of arrival of each photon .",
    "we found a significant amount of time difference ( @xmath70 and higher ) in higher inclination angle cases .",
    "redshift produces more energetic photons at higher inclination angles . also , the doppler line broadening features increase with the increasing inclination angle . + we show a particular case of thick disk shell between @xmath71 @xmath72 . in a tcaf we not only observe multicolor blackbody radiation from the standard keplerian disk component",
    ", we also observe power law component by comptonization of the photons intercepted by the thick disk . in future",
    ", we present these results , both continuum and line emission around schwarzschild and kerr black holes .",
