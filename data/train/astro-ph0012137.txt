    "recent analyses of the helioseismological data , from both the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) instrument on board the soho spacecraft ( howe et al .",
    "2000a ) and the global oscillation network group ( gong ) project ( antia & basu 2000 ) have provided strong evidence to indicate that the previously observed time variation of the differential rotation on the solar surface  the so called ` torsional oscillations ' with periods of about 11 years ( e.g.  howard & labonte 1980 ; snodgrass , howard & webster 1985 ; kosovichev & schou 1997 ; schou et al .",
    "1998 )  penetrates into the convection zone , to a depth of at least 9 percent of the solar radius .",
    "torsional oscillations are thought to be a consequence of the nonlinear interactions between the magnetic fields and the solar differential rotation .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to model these oscillations .",
    "these include modelling the dynamical feedback of the large scale magnetic field on the turbulent reynolds stresses that generate the differential rotation in the convection zone ( the ` nonlinear @xmath2effect ' : kitchatinov 1988 ; rdiger & kitchatinov 1990 ; kitchatinov et al .",
    "1994 ; kker et al .  1996 ; kitchatinov & pipin 1998 ; kitchatinov et al .",
    "1999 ) , as well as models in which the nonlinearity is through the direct action of the azimuthal component of the lorentz force of the dynamo generated magnetic field on the solar angular velocity ( e.g.  schuessler 1981 ; yoshimura 1981 ; brandenburg & tuominen 1988 ; jennings 1993 ; covas et al .",
    "2000a , b ; durney 2000 ) .    further studies of these data have produced intriguing , but rather contradictory results .",
    "howe et al .  ( 2000b ) find evidence for the presence of such oscillations around the tachocline near the bottom of the convection zone , but with markedly shorter periods of about @xmath3 years .",
    "on the other hand , antia & basu ( 2000 ) do not find such oscillations at the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "whatever the true dynamical behaviour at these lower levels may be , the crucial point about these recent results is that they both seem to indicate the possibility that the variations in the differential rotation can have different dynamical modes of behaviour at different depths in the solar convection zone : oscillations with a very different period in the former case and non - periodic behaviour in the latter .",
    "clearly , further observations are required to clarify this situation . however , whatever the outcome of such observations , it is of interest to ask whether such different variations can in principle occur in different spatial locations in the convection zone and , if so , what could be the possible mechanism(s ) for their production .",
    "this is of particular interest given the inevitable errors in helioseismological inversions , especially as depth increases .",
    "recently , _",
    "spatiotemporal fragmentation / bifurcation _ has been proposed as a possible dynamical mechanism to account for the observed multi - mode behaviour at different parts of the solar convection zone ( covas et al .",
    "2000b ) ( hereafter ctm ) .",
    "this occurs when dynamical regimes which possess different temporal behaviours coexist at different spatial locations , at _ given _ values of the control parameters of the system .",
    "the crucial point is that these different dynamical modes of behaviour can occur without requiring changes in the parameters of the model , in contrast to the usual temporal bifurcations which result in identical temporal behaviour at each spatial point , and which occur subsequent to changes in the model parameters .",
    "also , as we shall see below , spatiotemporal fragmentation / bifurcation is a dynamical mechanism , the occurrence of which does not depend upon the detailed physics at different spatial locations .",
    "evidence for the occurrence of this mechanism was produced in ctm in the context of a two dimensional axisymmetric mean field dynamo model operating in a spherical shell , with a semi ",
    "open outer boundary condition , in which the only nonlinearity is the action of the azimuthal component of the lorentz force of the dynamo generated magnetic field on the solar angular velocity .",
    "the zero order angular velocity was chosen to be consistent with the most recent helioseismological ( mdi ) data . despite the success of this model in producing spatiotemporal fragmentation ,",
    "a number of important questions remain .",
    "firstly , there are error bars due to the nature of the observational data as well as inversion schemes used .",
    "secondly , the model used by ctm is approximate and includes many simplifying assumptions . as a result , to be certain that spatiotemporal fragmentation can in fact",
    "be produced as a result of such nonlinear interactions , independently of the details of the model employed , it is necessary that it is robust , i.e. that it can produce such behaviour independently of these details .",
    "the aims of this paper are twofold .",
    "firstly , we make a systematic study of of this mechanism by making a comparison of the cases where the zero order rotational velocity are given by the inversions of the mdi and gong data respectively .",
    "given the detailed differences between these rotation profiles , this amounts to studying the robustness of the mechanism with respect to small changes in the zero order rotation profile .",
    "secondly , we study the robustness of this model ( in producing spatiotemporal fragmentation ) with respect to a number of plausible changes to its main ingredients , and demonstrate that the occurrence of this mechanism is not dependent upon the details of our model .",
    "we show that in addition to producing butterfly diagrams which are in qualitative agreement with the observations as well as displaying torsional oscillations that penetrate into the convection zone , as recently observed by howe et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and antia & basu ( 2000 ) , and studied by covas et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , the model can produce qualitatively different forms of spatiotemporal fragmentary behaviours , which could in principle account for either of the contradictory types of dynamical behaviour observed by howe et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and antia & basu ( 2000 ) at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section we outline our model .",
    "section 3 contains our detailed results for both mdi and gong data . in section 4",
    "we study the robustness of spatiotemporal fragmentation with respect to various changes in the details of our model and finally section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "we shall assume that the gross features of the large scale solar magnetic field can be described by a mean field dynamo model , with the standard equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mean magnetic field and the mean velocity respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath0 ( the @xmath0 effect ) and the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath7 , appear in the process of the parameterisation of the second order correlations between the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) . here",
    "@xmath10 , the term proportional to @xmath11 represents the effects of turbulent diamagnetism , and the velocity field is taken to be of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is a prescribed underlying rotation law and the component @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the operator @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the induction constant .",

    "@xmath39 and @xmath26 are the values of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity and viscosity respectively and @xmath40 is the turbulent prandtl number .",
    "the density @xmath41 is assumed to be uniform .    for our inner boundary conditions we chose @xmath42 on @xmath43 ( which enforces angular momentum conservation in the dynamo region , as discussed in moss & brooke 2000 ) . at the outer boundary ,",
    "we used an open boundary condition @xmath44 on @xmath23 , and vacuum boundary conditions for @xmath45 ( as in ctm ) .",
    "the motivation for the former condition is that the surface boundary condition is ill - defined , and there is some evidence that the more usual @xmath42 condition may be inadequate .",
    "this issue has recently been discussed at length by kitchatinov , mazur & jardine ( 2000 ) , who derive ` non - vacuum ' boundary conditions on both @xmath23 and @xmath45 .",
    "equations ( [ ns ] ) , ( [ a - eq ] ) and ( [ b - eq ] ) were solved using the code described in moss & brooke ( 2000 ) ( see also covas et al .",

    "we set @xmath48 ; with the solar convection zone proper being thought to occupy the region @xmath49 , the region @xmath50 can be thought of as an overshoot region / tachocline . in the following simulations we used a mesh resolution of @xmath51 points , uniformly distributed in radius and latitude respectively .",
    "the model employed in ctm had the following ingredients .",
    "in the interval @xmath52 , @xmath14 was given by the inversion of the mdi data obtained from 1996 to 1999 by howe et al .",
    "( 2000a ) . here , in addition to this , we shall for comparison also use the @xmath14 given by the inversion of the gong data obtained from 1995 to 1999 by howe et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "the form of @xmath0 was taken as @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( cf .",
    "rdiger & brandenburg 1995 ) .",
    "the model possessed radial dependence in both @xmath0 and the turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath1 : the @xmath0 profile was chosen by setting @xmath55 for @xmath56 with cubic interpolation to zero at @xmath43 and @xmath57 , with the convention that @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the @xmath1 profile was chosen in order to take into account the likely decrease of @xmath1 in the overshoot region , by allowing a simple linear decrease in @xmath60 from @xmath61 at @xmath62 to @xmath63 in @xmath64 .    in the following sections we shall , in addition to these particular profiles , also consider variations to them in order to study the robustness of the model ( in producing spatiotemporal fragmentation ) with respect to such changes . also for the sake of comparison",
    ", we shall use the interpolation on the gong data for the rotation law as well as allowing other changes .",
    "in this section , we study the presence of spatiotemporal fragmentation and torsional oscillations , using the zero order angular velocity obtained by the inversion of the gong data ( see fig .",
    "[ gong ] ) .",
    "this allows a detailed comparison to be made with the results of ctm which employed the corresponding mdi data ( see fig .",
    "[ mdi ] ) , including the magnetic field structure and strengths as well as the nature of torsional oscillations , as a function of depth and latitude .",
    "# 1#20.5#1    # 1#20.5#1    to begin with , we calibrated our model in each case so that near marginal excitation the cycle period was about 22 years .",
    "this determined @xmath65 to be @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 @xmath68 sec@xmath69 , given the known values of @xmath38 and @xmath24 .    in both cases , the first solutions to be excited in the linear theory",
    "are limit cycles with odd ( dipolar ) parity with respect to the equator , with marginal dynamo numbers @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively for the gong and mdi data . the even parity ( quadrupolar )",
    "solutions are also excited at similar marginal dynamo numbers of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "we note that these marginal dynamo numbers are slightly different from those reported in ctm as we have used here @xmath54 for the @xmath74dependence of the @xmath0 effect , whilst ctm used the prescription @xmath75 .    also , to be consistent with ctm , we chose the value of the prandtl number in this section to be @xmath76 .",
    "for the parameter range that we investigated , the even parity solutions can be nonlinearly stable .",
    "given that the sun is observed to be close to an odd ( dipolar ) parity state , and that previous experience shows that small changes in the physical model can cause a change between odd and even parities in the stable nonlinear solution , we chose to impose dipolar parity on our solutions , effectively solving the equations in one quadrant , @xmath77 , and imposing appropriate boundary conditions at the equator @xmath78 .    with these parameter values , we found that this model , with the underlying zero order angular velocity chosen to be consistent with either the mdi or the gong data , is capable of producing butterfly diagrams which are in qualitative agreement with the observations , as can be seen in figs.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-11.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.butterfly_bp ] and [ dp_r=0.64_calph=-9.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = gong_rho=1.butterfly_bp ] .",
    "we note that the butterfly diagrams in the gong case tend to be smoother and to have weaker polar branches , presumably because the mdi inversion is respectively less smooth and has a distinctive polar jet close to @xmath79 .    #",

    "the butterfly diagrams for the toroidal magnetic field , on the other hand , keep the same period and qualitative form throughout the convection zone , including the spatial regions that experience fragmentation , as shown in figs.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-11.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.butterfly_bp_bottom ] and [ dp_r=0.64_calph=-11.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.butterfly_bp_radial ] .",

    "we also made a detailed study of the magnetic field evolution and the magnitude of torsional oscillations in each case .",
    "[ magnetic.energy.averaged.calpha.gong-mdi ] summarises the results of the average magnetic energy as a function of @xmath82 , for both the mdi and the gong data , and demonstrates that both data sets produce almost the same average magnetic energy for a given @xmath82 .",
    "similarly , we have plotted in fig.[maxima.amplitude.torsional.oscillations.30.degrees.gong - mdi ] , the maxima ( of the absolute value ) of the residuals of the differential rotation , @xmath83 , as a function of @xmath82 , for both mdi and the gong data , which shows that for large values of @xmath84 , the gong data produce larger residuals .",
    "we end this section by summarising the qualitative modes of spatiotemporal behaviour our detailed numerical results have produced , for both mdi and gong data .",
    "our results show that our model is capable of producing three qualitatively different spatiotemporal modes of behaviour : ( i ) regimes in which there is no deformation of the torsional oscillation bands in the ( @xmath85 ) plane , and hence no changes in phase or period through the convection zone ; ( ii ) regimes in which there is deformation in the oscillatory bands in the ( @xmath85 ) plane , resulting in changes in the phase of the oscillations , but no changes in their period and ( iii ) regimes with spatiotemporal fragmentation , resulting in changes both in phase as well as in period / behaviour of oscillations .",
    "an example of the difference between such regions is given in fig.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-11.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.velocity_radial_latitude=30 ] , which shows a spatiotemporal fragmentation resulting in period halving , as well as a phase change between the oscillations near the surface and those deeper down in the convection zone .",
    "we should emphasise that by _ period _ we mean here the time between the maxima ( minima ) , rather than time between repeated sequences .",
    "we note that given the presence of noise , the error bars induced by the inversion and the shortness of the observational interval , the time between the maxima ( minima ) is the most relevant quantity from the point of view of comparison with observations .",
    "our results also show that using the zero order rotation produced by both the mdi and gong data gives rise to qualitatively similar results regarding both the spatiotemporal fragmentation and the torsional oscillations .",
    "there are , however , detailed quantitative differences .",
    "an example of this relates to the case ( ii ) above , where the location of where the fragmentation occurs is higher for mdi than for gong at higher values of @xmath86 ( see fig .  [ fragmentation.level.mdi.gong.sin4 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the phase shift is less pronounced for the mdi case than for the gong case , specially at higher @xmath87 values ( see fig .  [ phase.mdi.gong.sin4 ] ) .",

    "as noted above , the model of the solar dynamo used by ctm to demonstrate the presence of torsional oscillations and spatiotemporal fragmentation is inevitably approximate in nature and contains major simplifications and parameterizations .",
    "it is therefore important to ask to what extent the spatiotemporal fragmentation , as well as the qualitative features of torsional oscillations found in ctm , depend on the details of the model employed .    in order to go some way towards answering these questions",
    ", we shall in this section study the robustness of this model with respect to plausible changes to its main ingredients , considering these changes one by one .",
    "a feature of the model considered by ctm is the presence of radial variations in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and in particular the fact that @xmath0 was taken to be zero in @xmath88 .",
    "an obvious question is whether this variation is the source of the fragmentation described above , for example does it cause the dynamo region essentially to consist of two disparate parts , each with its own set of properties ?",
    "this is perhaps unlikely , as there is no independent dynamo action in @xmath89 , as @xmath90 there .",
    "nevertheless , to resolve this issue , we study the effects of changes in the radial variations of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 and subsequently examine a model in which neither vary radially .",
    "given the qualitative similarity of the results produced using the mdi and the gong data , and in order to keep the extent of the computations within tractable bounds , we consider only the mdi data in the following sections .",
    "we studied this by setting @xmath55 throughout the computational region , which changes the @xmath0 profile substantially . in spite of this , we found qualitatively similar forms of butterfly diagrams , torsional oscillations and spatiotemporal fragmentation in this case as in the case of ctm .",
    "an example of such fragmentation in the radial contours of @xmath80 is given in fig.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-11.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=0_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.velocity_radial_latitude=30 ] .",
    "we note that the change in the @xmath91-dependence of @xmath0 does not change the calibration of @xmath65 required to produce a cycle period of 22 years .",
    "it does , however , seem to change the details of the surface torsional oscillations , making them somewhat less realistic .",
    "it also , importantly from the point of view of observations , enhances the phase shift between the torsional oscillations at the top and below the deformation , to a phase change of @xmath92 as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ phase.others1 ] .",
    "note , however , that the phase shift @xmath93 changes continuously with @xmath94 .    # 1#20.38#1      to obtain some idea of the sensitivity of the model to the chosen radial dependence of the turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath1 , we then examined a model in which @xmath95 throughout . in this way we removed from the model",
    "the inhomogeneity associated with @xmath1 at the base of the convection zone .",
    "we found that with this form of @xmath1 , @xmath65 needs to be recalibrated to @xmath96 in order to produce toroidal field butterfly diagrams at the surface with a period of 22 years .    with this value of @xmath65 , we again found qualitatively similar forms of spatiotemporal fragmentation in this case , to those obtained by ctm .",
    "an example is given in fig.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-16.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=60000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=3_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.velocity_radial_latitude=30 ] .",
    "we note that , compared with the behaviour of the original model depicted in figs.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-9.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = gong_rho=1.butterfly_bp ] , this model produces more realistic torsional oscillations at the surface than the model with the radial dependence of @xmath0 removed . however , the butterfly diagrams of the toroidal magnetic field near the surface look slightly less realistic than those for the original model shown in fig.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-11.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=44000_ialp=3_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=0_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.butterfly_bp ] .",
    "but , it must be borne in mind that in the absence of a definitive sunspot model , it is not obvious at which depth the toroidal field patterns correspond to the observed butterfly diagram .",
    "furthermore , as a result of the removal of the radial variation of @xmath1 in this model , the effective magnetic turbulent diffusivity changes and consequently the range of @xmath82 values for spatiotemporal fragmentation are somewhat higher than for the model employed by ctm .",
    "we note also that the fragmentation is now present at higher radius and is in this case detached from the lower boundary .",
    "# 1#20.38#1      in the last two sections we studied the robustness of the spatiotemporal fragmentation and the torsional oscillations with respect to the removal of the radial dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in turn .",
    "interestingly , in both cases we found the spatiotemporal fragmentation to persist .",
    "here we investigate a model in which both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent of radius , so that ( unrealistically ) the convective region and overshoot layer are only distinguished by the nature of the given zero order rotation law .",
    "thus we considered a modification of the model considered by ctm , given by taking @xmath97 .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , we still found spatiotemporal fragmentation , as can be seen in fig.[dp_r=0.64_calph=-15.0_iangalp=11_p=-1.0_comega=60000_ialp=0_mesh=061x101_pr=1.0_ivac=2_eta=3_ns=1_rot = mdi2_rho=1.velocity_radial_latitude=30 ] .",
    "we note , however , that in this case both the butterfly diagrams of the toroidal field and the torsional oscillations near the surface look less realistic than the original model of sect .",
    "our point is however that spatiotemporal fragmentation appears to be a general property of the type of dynamo models studied , and is not crucially dependent on imposed spatial structures in the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that might be thought to distinguish the lower part of the dynamo region from the subsurface layers .",
