    "the complex scalar doublet of the standard model accommodates all of the necessary masses for elementary particles .",

    "recently , atlas and cms have discovered a higgs - like boson with a mass near 125 gev @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations of the scalar doublet with the su(2 ) gauge part of the electroweak theory give a nonperturbative description of the higgs mechanism .",
    "early studies @xcite revealed two regions in the phase diagram : the higgs region with three massive vector bosons and a single higgs particle , and the confinement region with qcd - like bound states of the fundamental fields .",
    "these two regions are partially separated by a first - order phase transition , but are analytically connected beyond the phase transition s end point .",
    "subsequent lattice studies of the su(2)-higgs model have explored the electroweak finite - temperature phase transition @xcite and recent work has incorporated additional scalar doublets @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the spectrum of the standard su(2)-higgs model at zero temperature in the higgs region of the phase diagram .",
    "as already mentioned , there will be a higgs boson ( @xmath1 ) and three massive vector bosons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , but the spectrum contains much more than this .    for comparison recall the well - known case of qcd , which has a small number of fields in the lagrangian ( gluons and quarks ) and a huge number of particles in the spectrum ( glueballs and hadrons ) .",
    "the glueballs and hadrons are created by gauge - invariant operators but the gluons and quarks correspond to gauge - dependent fields in the lagrangian .",
    "the spectrum of the su(2)-higgs model is similar , at least in the confinement region : the lagrangian contains gauge fields and a doublet of scalar fields , but lattice simulations suggest a dense spectrum of `` w - balls '' and `` hadrons . ''",

    "it is interesting to consider the spectrum in the higgs region of the phase diagram . at weak coupling",
    "( which is directly relevant to the actual experimental situation ) , one might anticipate one higgs boson , three vector bosons , and nothing else . on the other hand , since the higgs region and the confinement region are truly a single phase , one might wonder whether the rich spectrum of confinement - region states will persist into the higgs region , though smoothly rearranged in some way .",
    "an appealing view can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite where the smooth transition from confinement region to higgs region was observed for an su(2)-higgs model in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "reference  @xcite describes the results in terms of a flux loop that is completely stable in the pure gauge theory but can decay in the confinement region of the su(2)-higgs phase diagram . when approaching the analytic pathway into the higgs region , such decays become so rapid that the particle description loses its relevance , leaving the higgs region with the simple spectrum of higgs and @xmath0 bosons .",

    "therefore a thorough lattice study of the spectrum will always involve many states appearing with many different quantum numbers .",
