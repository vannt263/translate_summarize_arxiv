    "there has been a long history of studying nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) interaction since the yukawa theory . in the effective meson - nucleon coupling model , after including pseudo - scalar- , vector- and scalar - meson , especially the @xmath0-meson , the @xmath1 interaction has been described very well@xcite . in the traditional picture of @xmath1 interaction , the short - range repulsion",
    "is provided by vector - meson ( @xmath2 ) exchange , the intermediate - range attraction is accounted for by @xmath0-meson exchange , and the long - range tail is attributed to @xmath3 exchange .",
    "the pseudo - scalar and vector mesons are well established , whereas the scalar - meson @xmath0 is still in controversy which had been listed , dropped and relisted in the particle data compilation@xcite . with the advancement of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , to understand the @xmath1 interaction from the fundamental quark - gluon degree of freedom is expected .",
    "however there are only very preliminary lattice qcd calculations of the @xmath1 interaction due to the complexity of low energy qcd@xcite .",
    "various new approaches have been developed since the end of 1970 s .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory described the @xmath1 interaction very well where only @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) exchange is employed @xcite .",
    "the most common used quark model in the study of @xmath1 interaction is the chiral quark model@xcite . both in meson - nucleon coupling and quark - meson coupling model ( chiral quark model is a typical one ) the @xmath0 meson is indispensable and which is assumed for a long time to be an effective description of the correlated @xmath5 resonance .",
    "recently a very broad @xmath0-meson as a resonance of @xmath5 was reported@xcite .",
    "however the results , found by three groups independently , show that the correlated two - pion exchange between two nucleons results in strong short - range repulsion and very moderate long - range attraction which is quite different from the intermediate range attraction resulted from the @xmath0 meson exchange@xcite .",
    "this raises a question : is the @xmath0-meson used in the one boson exchange model and chiral quark model the correlated @xmath5 resonance or other effective one ?",
    "is there an alternative approach to account for the @xmath1 intermediate range attraction ?",
    "in addition , a long standing fact of the similarity of molecular and nuclear force is well - known , but no theoretical explanation so far .",
    "is it accidental or is there a similar mechanism for molecular and nuclear force behind ?    in 1990",
    "s , a modified version of quark cluster model : quark delocalization color screening model @xcite , is proposed .",
    "two new ingredients were introduced : quark delocalization ( to enlarge the model variational space to take into account the mutual distortion or the internal excitations of nucleons in the course of interaction ) and color screening ( assuming the quark - quark interaction dependent on quark states aimed to take into account the qcd effect which has not been included in the two body confinement and effective one gluon exchange yet ) . the model has been successfully applied to describe @xmath1 , hyperon - nucleon scattering@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the intermediate - range attraction is achieved by the quark delocalization , which is like the electron delocalization in molecules .",
    "the color screening is needed to make the quark delocalization effective .",
    "the model gave a natural explanation of the similarity between molecular force and nuclear force .",
    "since 2000 , the model is extended to incorporate the goldstone - boson - exchange to describe the long - range tail of the @xmath1 interaction@xcite which is hard to be described with quark - gluon degree of freedom .",
    "then the only difference between the chiral quark model@xcite and qdcsm is the intermediate - range attraction mechanism .",
    "it is interesting to compare the two approaches to see whether the effect of @xmath0-meson can be replaced by the new mechanism introduced in qdcsm .",
    "after the introduction , section ii gives a brief description of the two approaches to @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the comparison between the two approaches is presented in section iii .",
    "a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "the salamanca model was chosen as the representative of the chiral quark models , because salamanca group s work covers the hadron spectra and nucleon - nucleon interaction , and has been extended to multi - quark states study .",
    "the model details can be found in ref.@xcite . here only the hamiltonian and parameters are given .",
    "the hamiltonian of salamanca model in @xmath1 sector can be written as @xcite      @xmath7 is quark tensor operator .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are standard yukawa functions .",
    "@xmath10 is the kinetic energy of the center of mass .",
    "@xmath11 is the chiral coupling constant , which is determined from @xmath3-nucleon coupling constant as usual .",
    "all other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "the parameters of hamiltonian are given in table i.      the qdcsm model and its extension were discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian and trial wavefunction of the extended qdcsm are given below .",

    "the parameters of the model are given in table i too .",

    "the same @xmath3-exchange used in the two models assure the properties of deuteron be fitted equally well .",

    "by calculating the deuteron properties and @xmath1 scattering phase shifts , we compared the qdcsm with the salamanca version of the chiral quark model , both models give a good description of the deuteron and @xmath1 scattering , although different intermediate - range attraction mechanisms were used .",
    "the almost same agreement with experimental data suggest that the @xmath0-meson exchange can be replaced by quark delocalization and color screening mechanism .",
