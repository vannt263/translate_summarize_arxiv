    "series of runs , initial orbits were close to those of several ( 10 and 20 ) real jfcs , and in each of other series they were close to the orbit of a single real jfc ( 2p , 9p , 10p , 22p , 28p , 39p , or 44p ) . in our runs , planets were considered as material points , so literal collisions did not occur . however , using the orbital elements sampled with a 500 yr step , we calculated the mean probability @xmath4 of collisions ( see our previous papers for details ) .",
    "in our runs , some former jfcs moved in typical near - earth object ( neo ) orbits , and a few of them got orbits with aphelion distance @xmath5@xmath23 au for millions of years .",
    "the main portion of the probability of collisions of former jfcs with the terrestrial planets was due to a small ( @xmath10.1 % ) portion of objects that moved during several myrs in orbits with @xmath5@xmath24.2 au .",

    "the probability of a collision of this object with the earth was about 1 , and it was greater than that for all other 99 objects in that run by two orders of magnitude .    ipatov and mather ( 2004a ) showed that during the accumulation of the giant planets the total mass of icy bodies delivered to the earth could be about the mass of water in earth s oceans .",
    "many earth - crossing objects can move in highly eccentric ( @xmath10@xmath70.6 ) orbits and , probably , most of 1-km objects in such orbits have not yet been discovered .",
    "if one observes former jfcs in neo orbits , then most of them could have already moved in such orbits for millions ( or at least hundreds of thousands ) of years .",
    "some former comets that have moved in typical neo orbits for millions or even hundreds of millions of years , and might have had multiple close encounters with the sun , could have lost their typically dark surface material , thus brightening their low albedo and assuming the aspect typical of an asteroid ( for most observed neos , the albedo is greater than that for comets ) . on the contrary , napier et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that the surfaces of innert comets became extremely dark and most of such comets became invisible .",
    "if many of extinct comets disintegrated , then there can be many mini - comets in the near - earth space , and the tunguska comet could be one of them .",
    "at least one of the below conclusions follow from our runs : 1 ) the portion of 1-km former trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) among neos can exceed several tens of percent , 2 ) the number of tnos migrating inside solar system could be smaller by a factor of several than it was earlier considered , 3 ) most of 1-km former tnos that had got neo orbits disintegrated into mini - comets and dust during a smaller part of their dynamical lifetimes if these lifetimes are not small .",
    "using the bulirsh  stoer method of integration , we investigated the migration of dust particles under the influence of planetary gravity ( excluding pluto for asteroidal and cometary particles ) , radiation pressure , poynting  robertson drag , and solar wind drag .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of the asteroidal particles were the same as those of the first @xmath22 numbered main - belt asteroids ( jdt 2452500.5 ) , i.e. , dust particles are assumed to leave the asteroids with zero relative velocity .",

    "some asteroidal particles migrated into the 1:1 resonance with jupiter . for @xmath6@xmath710 au perihelia were usually near jupiter s orbit , but sometimes also near saturn s orbit .    the mean time spent by an asteroidal dust particle in inner - earth ( @xmath84@xmath20.983 au ) , aten ( @xmath6@xmath21 au , @xmath5@xmath70.983 au ) , apollo ( @xmath6@xmath71 au , @xmath85@xmath21.017 au ) , and amor ( @xmath6@xmath71 au , 1.017@xmath2@xmath9@xmath21.300 au ) orbits was 22 , 5.6 , 18 , and 30 kyr at @xmath32=0.01 and 0.4 , 0.3 , 1.8 , and 3.0 kyr at @xmath32=0.4 , respectively .",
    "the ratio of mean times spent by encke particles in inner - earth , aten , and apollo orbits was about 1.5 : 1 : 2 , but varied from run to run .",
    "the total mass of comets inside jupiter s orbit is much smaller than the total mass of asteroids , but a comet produces more dust per unit minor body mass than an asteroid .",
    "analysis of the pioneer 10 and 11 meteoroid detector data ( humes , 1980 ; grn , 1994 ) showed that a population of @xmath14 and @xmath16 g ( @xmath110 @xmath3 m ) particles has a constant spatial density between 3 and 18 au .",

    "liou et al .

    "so asteroidal dust particles can not explain the constant spatial density of dust particles at @xmath71@xmath13 - 18 au . at such distances ,",
    "many of the dust particles could have come from the trans - neptunian belt or from passing comets . in our runs at @xmath32@xmath230.05 a spatial density @xmath87 of considered trans - neptunian particles",
    "near ecliptic at @xmath71=1 au was greater than at @xmath71@xmath71 au . at 0.1@xmath15@xmath32@xmath150.4 and 2@xmath2@xmath71@xmath245",
    "au ( at @xmath32=0.05 for @xmath89@xmath2@xmath71@xmath250 au ) for trans - neptunian particles , @xmath87 varied with @xmath71 by less than a factor of 4 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the observations and with the simulations made by liou and zook ( 1999 ) with the use of radau integrator .",
    "the spatial density of dust particles was greater for smaller @xmath71 at @xmath71@xmath24 au ( exclusive for encke particles at @xmath32=0.4 ) .",
    "for asteroidal and trans - neptunian dust , depending on @xmath32 , it was more at 1 au than at 3 au by a factor of 2.5 - 8 ( by a factor of 10 - 16 for encke particles at 0.01@xmath15@xmath32@xmath150.2 ) .",
    "this is in accordance with the observations for the inner solar system : inversion of zodiacal light observations by the helios spaceprobe revealed a particle density @xmath87@xmath90@xmath91 , pioneer 10 observations between the earth s orbit and the asteroid belt yielded @xmath87@xmath90@xmath92 , and iras observations have yielded @xmath87@xmath90@xmath93 ( reach , 1992 ) .",

    ". positions of particles were taken from the runs discussed above .",
    "for each such stored position , we calculated @xmath710@xmath94 different positions of a particle and the earth during the period @xmath95 of revolution of the particle around the sun , considering that orbital elements do not vary during @xmath95 .",
    "three different scattering functions were considered . in the first model ,",
    "the scattering function depended on a scattering angle @xmath96 in such a way : 1/@xmath96 for @xmath96@xmath2c , 1+(@xmath96-c)@xmath97 for @xmath96@xmath7c , where @xmath96 is in radians and c=2@xmath98/3 radian . in the second model",
    ", we added the same dependence on elongation @xmath99 ( considered westward from the sun ) . in the third model ,",
    "the scattering function did nt depend on these angles at all .",
    "for all these three models , the scattering function was proportional to @xmath100@xmath65@xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the distance between a particle and the earth and @xmath103 is a wavelength of light .",
    "for each considered position , we calculated velocities of a dust particle relative to the sun and the earth and used these velocities and the scattering function for construction of the solar spectrum received at the earth after been scattering by different particles located at some beam ( view of sight ) from the earth .",
    "the direction of the beam is characterized by @xmath99 and inclination @xmath11 .",
    "particles in the cone of 2@xmath12 around this direction were considered . in each run , particles of the same size ( at the same @xmath32 ) and the same source ( i.e. , asteroidal ) were studied .",
    "the plots of the obtained spectrum ( e.g. , fig . 1 ) are in general agreement with the observations made by reynolds et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who measured the profile of the scattered solar mg i@xmath1035184 absorption line in the zodiacal light .",
    "unlike results by clarke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , our modeled spectra do nt exhibit strong asymmetry .",
    "as these authors , we obtained that minima in the plots of dependencies of the intensity of light on its wavelength near 5184 angstrom are not so deep as those for the initial solar spectrum .",
    "the details of plots depend on diameters , inclinations , and a source of particles .",
    "different particles populations produce clearly distinct model spectra of the zodiacal light .",
    "for example , for @xmath11=0 and kuiperoidal particles , the shift of the plot to the blue was greater than those for asteroidal and encke particles at @xmath99=90@xmath12 , and the shift to the red was greater at @xmath99=270@xmath12 .",
    "the results of modeling are relatively insensitive to the scattering function considered , the difference was greater for more close direction to the sun . our preliminary models and comparison with observational data indicate that for more precise observations it will be possible to distinguish well the sources of the dust and impose constrains on the particle size .",
    "( in angstrom ) at @xmath32=0.2 , @xmath99=270@xmath12 , and @xmath11=0 .",

    "the most thin line denotes the initial solar spectrum .",
    "solar spectra for asteroidal ( ast ) and encke ( com ) particles are practically the same for three scattering functions . for trans - neptunian ( tn ) particles for the first and the second models ( e.g. , denoted as tn 1 and tn 2 , respectively ) the plots are practically the same , but the plot for the third model ( denoted simply as tn ) is different . for observations ( made by reynolds et al . ,",
    "2004 ) only the value of elongation is presented in the legend .",
    "designation `` observ / sol spectr '' corresponds to the case for which the plot based on the observations was stretched in such a way that the minimum became the same as that for the initial solar spectrum .",
    "the maximum value was considered to be the same ( equal to 1 ) for all plots . , width=472 ]    for asteroidal and encke particles at @xmath11=0 , about 65 - 89% and 70 - 85% of brightness was due to the particles at distance from the earth @xmath102@xmath21 au ( 83 - 96% for @xmath102@xmath21.5 au ; 80 - 98% for @xmath71@xmath22 au ) . for trans - neptunian particles , 14 - 78%",
    ", 22 - 85% , 26 - 78% , and 40 - 90% of brightness was due to @xmath102@xmath21 au , @xmath102@xmath21.5 au , @xmath71@xmath22 au , and @xmath71@xmath25 au , respectively .",
    "the above ranges were caused by different values of @xmath32 and @xmath99 and different scattering functions considered .",
    "only a few trans - neptunian particles in one run reached the near - earth space , so statistics was not good and could increase the above intervals . according to grn ( 1994 ) , the intensity @xmath106 of zodiacal light falls off with heliocentric distance @xmath71 as @xmath106@xmath1@xmath107 , with @xmath108=2 to 2.5 and beyond about 3 au zodiacal light was no longer observable above the background light . at @xmath32@xmath230.05",
    "the brightness of all trans - neptunian dust particles located at @xmath71@xmath73 au was less by only a factor of several than that at @xmath71@xmath23 au , so the contribution of trans - neptunian dust particles at @xmath0@xmath210 @xmath3 m to the zodiacal light may not be large ( else zodiacal light will be observed beyond 3 au ) , but this problem needs more accurate estimates . based on our runs , we suppose that the fraction of trans - neptunian dust particles among particles of different origin for larger particles can be much smaller than those for @xmath0@xmath210 @xmath3 m .",
    "note that it is considered that the main contribution to the zodiacal light is from particles with diameters of about 20 to 200 @xmath3 m .",
    "velocities of dust particles relative to the earth that mainly contributed to brightness were different for different @xmath99 . at @xmath11=0",
    "they were between -25 and 25 km / s .",
    "some jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) can reach typical near - earth object ( neo ) orbits and remain there for millions of years . while the probability of such events is small ( @xmath10.1 % ) , nevertheless the majority of collisions of former jfcs with the terrestrial planets are due to such objects .",
    "most former tnos that have typical neo orbits moved in such orbits for millions of years , so during most of this time there were extinct comets .",
    "if those former jfcs that got neo orbits for millions of years did nt disintegrate during this time , there could be many ( up to tens of percent ) extinct comets among neos .",
    "collision probabilities of migrating asteroidal and cometary dust particles with the terrestrial planets during the lifetimes of these particles were maximum at diameter @xmath0@xmath1100 @xmath3 m , which is in accordance with the analysis of microcraters .",
    "the probability of collisions of cometary particles with the earth is smaller than for asteroidal particles , and this difference is greater at @xmath0@xmath1100 @xmath3 m . at @xmath0@xmath210 micron , the mean time spent by a former trans - neptunian particle in neo orbits is less than that for an asteroidal dust particle by an order of magnitude , and the difference in collision probabilities with the earth during a lifetime of a particle is less than the difference in the mean time .",
