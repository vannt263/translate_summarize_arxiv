    "as we can see , the cross section has no small coupling constants and it rises rapidly with the energy , while hard perturbative processes are highly suppressed above the scale @xmath10 .",
    "the summation over all types of initial partons in ( [ bh10 ] ) results in an additional enhancement of the black hole production .",

    "the remaining energy of the black hole is mainly lost in a schwartzchild phase . at this stage ,",
    "the black hole s evaporation is a thermal ( grey body ) emission at hawking temperature ( [ bh6 ] ) .",
    "it is important that the black hole decays visibly to the sm particles living on the brane  @xcite .",
