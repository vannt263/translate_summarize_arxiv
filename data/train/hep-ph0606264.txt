    "although the top quark was discovered almost ten years ago  @xcite , many of its properties are still only poorly known  @xcite . in particular , the couplings of the top quark to the electroweak ( ew ) gauge bosons have not yet been directly measured .",
    "current data provide only weak constraints on the couplings of the top quark with the ew gauge bosons , except for the @xmath1 vector and axial vector couplings which are rather tightly but indirectly constrained by lep data ; and the right - handed @xmath2 coupling , which is severely bound by the observed @xmath3 rate  @xcite .    at an @xmath4 linear collider with @xmath5  gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath6  fb@xmath7",
    "one can hope to measure the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) couplings in top pair production with a few - percent precision  @xcite .",
    "however , the process @xmath10 is sensitive to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings and significant cancellations between the various couplings can occur . at hadron colliders ,",
    "@xmath11 production is so dominated by the qcd processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 that a measurement of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings via @xmath14 is hopeless . instead",
    ", the @xmath8 couplings can be measured in qcd @xmath15 production , radiative top quark decays in @xmath11 events ( @xmath16 ) , and qcd @xmath17 production  @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 production and radiative top quark decays are sensitive only to the @xmath0 couplings , whereas @xmath17 production gives information only on the structure of the @xmath1 vertex .",
    "this obviates having to disentangle potential cancellations between the different couplings .",
    "here we briefly discuss the measurement of the @xmath8 couplings at the lhc and compare the expected sensitivities with the bounds which one hopes to achieve at an @xmath4 linear collider .",
    "the most general lorentz - invariant vertex function describing the interaction of a neutral vector boson @xmath18 with two top quarks can be written in terms of ten form factors  @xcite , which are functions of the kinematic invariants . in the low energy limit , these correspond to couplings which multiply dimension - four or -five operators in an effective lagrangian , and may be complex .",
    "if @xmath18 is on - shell , or if @xmath18 couples to effectively massless fermions , the number of independent form factors is reduced to eight .",
    "if , in addition , both top quarks are on - shell , the number is further reduced to four . in this case , the @xmath8 vertex can be written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the proton charge , @xmath21 is the top quark mass , @xmath22 is the outgoing top ( anti - top ) quark four - momentum , and @xmath23 .",
    "the terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the low energy limit are the @xmath8 vector and axial vector form factors .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 are related to the magnetic and ( @xmath28-violating ) electric dipole form factors .",
    "the most promising channel for measuring the @xmath0 couplings at the lhc is @xmath29 , which receives contributions from @xmath30 production and ordinary @xmath31 production where one of the top quarks decays radiatively ( @xmath32 ) . in order to reduce the background , it is advantageous to require that both @xmath33-quarks are tagged .",
    "we assume a combined efficiency of @xmath34 for tagging both @xmath33-quarks .",
    "the non - resonant @xmath35 background and the single - top backgrounds , @xmath36 , can be suppressed by imposing invariant and transverse mass cuts which require that the event is consistent either with @xmath15 production , or with @xmath11 production with radiative top decay  @xcite .",
    "imposing a large separation cut of @xmath37 reduces photon radiation from the @xmath33 quarks .",
    "photon emission from @xmath38 decay products can essentially be eliminated by requiring that @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the invariant mass of the @xmath42 system , and @xmath43 is the @xmath44 cluster transverse mass , which peaks sharply at @xmath45 . after imposing the cuts described above , the irreducible backgrounds are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the signal .",
    "the potentially most dangerous reducible background is @xmath46 production where one of the jets in the final state fakes a photon .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     -1.cm    the @xmath47 boson transverse momentum distribution for the trilepton final state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a for the sm signal and backgrounds , as well as for the signal with several non - standard @xmath1 couplings . only one coupling at a time is allowed to deviate from its sm prediction .",
    "the backgrounds are each more than one order of magnitude smaller than the sm signal .",
    "note that varying @xmath48 leads mostly to a cross section normalization change , hardly affecting the shape of the @xmath49 distribution .    for the @xmath50",
    "@xcite final state at least 3  jets with @xmath51  gev and @xmath52 are required .",
    "the largest backgrounds for this final state come from @xmath31 and @xmath53 production where one or several jets are badly mismeasured , from @xmath54 with @xmath55 and the charged lepton being missed , and from @xmath56 production , where one top decays hadronically , @xmath57 , and the other via @xmath58 with the @xmath59-lepton decaying hadronically , @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b we show the missing transverse momentum distributions of the sm @xmath61 signal ( solid curve ) and various backgrounds .",
    "the most important backgrounds are @xmath62 and @xmath56 production .",
    "however , the missing transverse momentum distribution from these processes falls considerably faster than that of the signal , and for @xmath63  gev , the sm signal dominates .",
    "the shape and normalization changes of the photon or @xmath47-boson transverse momentum distribution can be used to derive sensitivity bounds on the anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings . for @xmath17 production with @xmath64 ,",
    "the distribution of the @xmath65 opening angle in the transverse plane , @xmath66 , provides additional information  @xcite . in the following",
    "we assume a normalization uncertainty of the sm cross section of @xmath67 .",
    "even for a modest integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath7 , it will be possible to measure the @xmath0 vector and axial vector couplings , and the dipole form factors , with a precision of typically @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . for 300  fb@xmath7",
    ", the limits improve to @xmath70 for @xmath71 and to about @xmath68 for @xmath72 .    to extract bounds on the @xmath1 couplings , we perform a simultaneous fit to the @xmath49 and the @xmath73 distributions for the trilepton and dilepton final states , and to the @xmath74 distribution for the @xmath75 final state . for an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath7",
    ", it will be possible to measure the @xmath1 axial vector coupling with a precision of @xmath76 , and @xmath77 with a precision of @xmath78 . at the slhc , assuming an integrated luminosity of 3000  fb@xmath7 , these bounds can be improved by factors of about  1.6 ( @xmath77 ) and  3 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the bounds which can be achieved for @xmath80 are much weaker than those projected for @xmath79 . as mentioned in sec .  4 ,",
    "the @xmath49 distributions for the sm and for @xmath81 are almost degenerate .",
    "this is also the case for the @xmath73 distribution . in a fit to these two distributions , therefore , an area centered at @xmath82 remains which can not be excluded , even at the slhc . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the two regions merge , resulting in rather poor limits .",
    "it is instructive to compare the bounds for anomalous @xmath8 couplings achievable at the lhc with those projected for the ilc .",
    "the most complete study of @xmath11 production at the ilc for general @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) couplings so far is that of ref .",
    "note that only one coupling at a time is allowed to deviate from its sm value in ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing the projected lhc and ilc sensitivity bounds ,",
    "one finds  @xcite that , even if the slhc operates first , and the @xmath75 final state is taken into account , a linear collider will still be able to significantly improve the @xmath1 anomalous coupling limits , with the possible exception of @xmath83 .",
    "the ilc will also be able to considerably strengthen the bounds on @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this picture could change once correlations between different non - standard @xmath1 couplings , and between @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings , are taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , so far no realistic studies for @xmath86 which include these correlations have been performed .",
    "many models of new physics predict anomalous @xmath1 couplings . examples are top - seesaw models  @xcite and little higgs models  @xcite , which predict an up - type quark singlet @xmath87 which mixes with the top quark .",
    "this changes coupling of the left - handed top quark to the @xmath47-boson : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the @xmath90 mixing angle .    it is straightforward to derive bounds for @xmath91 from the general limits on @xmath48 outlined in sec .  5 .",
    "with 300  fb@xmath7 , @xmath91 can be restricted to @xmath92 at the slhc it will be possible to improve these bounds by about a factor  2.8 .    in the @xmath93 littlest higgs model with t - parity  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath91 is related to the mass of the heavy top quark partner , @xmath87 , the @xmath94 coupling ( @xmath95 is the higgs boson ) , @xmath96 , and the sm higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath97  gev , by @xmath98 in this model , the bounds on @xmath91 can be converted into limits on @xmath99 . for 300  fb@xmath7",
    "one finds  @xcite @xmath100 since the lhc should be able to discover a @xmath87 quark with a mass of @xmath101  tev  @xcite , a measurement of @xmath79 can provide valuable information on @xmath96 .",
    "the lhc will be able to perform first tests of the @xmath8 couplings . already with an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath7 , one can probe the @xmath0 couplings with a precision of about @xmath102 per experiment . with higher integrated luminosities",
    "one will be able to reach the few percent region .",
    "the lhc will also be able to probe the @xmath1 couplings , albeit not with the same level of precision .",
    "however , a measurement of @xmath79 will constrain the parameter space of models with an extra up - type singlet quark , such as little higgs models .",
    "the ilc will be able to further improve our knowledge of the @xmath8 couplings , in particular in the @xmath1 case .",
