    "such feature was already noted in the _ sd _ shell , and can be explained by examining the isovector and isoscalar components of the m1 operator separately @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moment is dominated by the isovector term due to the opposite signs and nearly equal magnitude of the neutron and proton magnetic moments , whereas @xmath125 is an isoscalar quantity .",

    "the contribution to @xmath125 from the tensor term @xmath144 is small as @xmath125=0.94 ( 0.87 ) is calculated with ( without ) the tensor term .",
    "the good agreement between the present result and the @xmath125 calculated with @xmath145 in the _ sd _ shell implies that a universal operator can be applied to both the _ sd _ and _ fp _ shells .",
    "however , for more detailed discussion , effective m1 operators of the _ fp _ shell nuclei have to be determined from the mirror moments in the _ fp _ shell , for which more experimental data are required .",
