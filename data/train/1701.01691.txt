    "the emerging area of _ magnetism in curved geometries _ encompasses a range of fascinating geometry - induced effects in the magnetic properties of materials @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations in this area are providing new insights into the behaviour of curved magnetic nanostructures and the control of their magnetic excitations , with applications to shapeable magnetoelectronics @xcite and prospective energy - efficient data storage , among others .    in continuum models ,",
    "the magnetization is represented by a three - dimensional unit - vector field @xmath1 .",
    "the study of curvature  induced effects in vector - field models in one- and two - dimensional geometries has a rather long history @xcite . in spite of numerous results @xcite ,",
    "the problem is far from being fully solved . in the majority of these studies ,",
    "the vector field is taken to be tangent to the domain .",
    "in particular , a general expression for the surface energy of a tangential director field describing a nematic liquid crystal in a curvilinear shell was recently obtained @xcite , with possible applications using different geometries and orientational ordering @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a strictly tangential field was also used in a study of the role of curvature in the interaction between defects in 2d @xmath2-like models , with applications to superfluids , superconductors , and liquid crystals deposited on curved surfaces @xcite .    very recently a fully 3d approach was developed for thin magnetic shells and wires of arbitrary shape @xcite .",
    "this approach yields an energy for arbitrary curves and surfaces and for arbitrary magnetization fields under the assumption that the anisotropy greatly exceeds the dipolar interaction , so that @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the exchange energy density and @xmath5 is the density of effective anisotropy interaction .",
    "we consider the model of isotropic exchange , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 with @xmath8 describes the cartesian components of magnetization .",
    "therefore in cartesian coordinates , the sample geometry appears only through the anisotropy term via the spatial variation of the anisotropy axis ; for example , in the case of a uniaxial curved magnet , @xmath5 is given by @xmath9 , where the unit vector @xmath10 determines the direction of the easy axis .",
    "in curvilinear coordinates adapted to the sample geometry , the spatial variation of the anisotropy axes is automatically accounted for , and the anisotropy energy density assumes its usual translation - invariant form .",
    "instead , the exchange energy acquires two additional terms , which describe contributions to @xmath11 due to the spatial variation of the coordinate frame @xcite , namely curvilinear - geometry - induced effective anisotropy and curvilinear - geometry - induced effective dzyaloshinskii  moriya interaction . for magnetic shells ,",
    "these contributions may be expressed in terms of local curvatures @xcite ; for magnetic wires , in terms of curvature and torsion @xcite . below we review briefly some manifestations of these contributions , which have been reported elsewhere .",
    "curvilinear - geometry - induced effective anisotropy_. geometry - induced anisotropy can have a significant effect on the ground - state magnetization profile , rendering it no longer strictly tangential , even in the case of strong easy - tangential anisotropy .",
    "for example , for a helical nanowire with strong anisotropy directed along the wire , the ground - state magnetization is always tilted in the local rectifying surface , with tilting angle dependent on the product of the curvature and the torsion @xcite . for two - dimensional geometries with nontrivial topology ,",
    "a striking manifestation of geometry - induced anisotropy is shape  induced patterning . in",
    "spherical shells , a strictly in - surface magnetization is forbidden due to the hairy  ball theorem @xcite .",
    "instead , the ground - state magnetization profile has two oppositely disposed vortices @xcite .",
    "another nontrivial example is the mbius ring . since",
    "a mbius ring is a nonorientable surface , its topology forces a discontinuity in any nonvanishing normal vector field .",
    "recently we proposed that magnetic nanostructures shaped as mbius strips possess non - volatility in their magneto - electric response due to the presence of topologically protected magnetic domain walls in materials with an out - of - plane orientation of the easy axis of magnetization @xcite . in both of these examples , the link between surface topology and magnetization is a consequence of geometry ",

    ", torsion can produce negative domain wall mobility @xcite , while curvature can produce a shift in the walker breakdown @xcite .",
    "we have briefly described a theoretical framework for studying different curvilinear systems , including 1d nanowires and 2d nanoshells . in this approach",
    "we suppose that the effects of nonlocal dipole - dipole interactions can be reduced to an effective easy - surface anisotropy . in the 1d case",
    ", this reduction has been rigorously justified in the limit where the diameter of the wire @xmath12 is much smaller than its length @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "similar arguments have been provided in the 2d case for planar thin films @xcite and thin shells @xcite where the surface thickness @xmath12 is much less than the lateral size @xmath13 .    in the current study",
    "we consider a _ ribbon _ , which represents a curve with an infinitesimal neighbourhood of a surface along it @xcite . for a narrow ribbon",
    "whose thickness @xmath12 is much less than its width @xmath14 , which in turn is much less than its length @xmath13 , namely @xmath15 , another micromagnetic limit is realized .",
    "we show that the micromagnetic energy can be reduced to the energy of a wire with modified curvature , torsion and anisotropy .",
    "we illustrate this approach with two examples , namely a narrow helicoid ribbon and a mbius ribbon .",
    "the existence of a new nonhomogeneous ground state is predicted for the mbius ribbon over a range of anisotropy parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the prediction is confirmed by full scale spin  lattice simulations .",
    "we also analyse the magnon spectrum for a narrow helicoid ribbon : unlike the magnon spectrum for a straight wire , there appears an asymmetry in the dispersion law caused by the geometric and magnetic chiralities .",

    "we derive the micromagnetic energy for a narrow ribbon , which may be interpreted as a modification of the 1d micromagnetic energy of its central curve .",

    "<S> a ribbon is a surface swept out by a line segment turning as it moves along a central curve . for narrow magnetic ribbons , for which the length of the line segment is much less than the length of the curve , the anisotropy induced by the magnetostatic interaction is biaxial , with hard axis normal to the ribbon and easy axis along the central curve . </S>",
    "<S> the micromagnetic energy of a narrow ribbon reduces to that of a one - dimensional ferromagnetic wire , but with curvature , torsion and local anisotropy modified by the rate of turning . </S>",
    "<S> these general results are applied to two examples , namely a helicoid ribbon , for which the central curve is a straight line , and a mbius ribbon , for which the central curve is a circle about which the line segment executes a @xmath0 twist . in both examples , for large positive tangential anisotropy , the ground state magnetization lies tangent to the central curve . </S>",
    "<S> as the tangential anisotropy is decreased , the ground state magnetization undergoes a transition , acquiring an in - surface component perpendicular to the central curve . for the helicoid ribbon </S>",
    "<S> , the transition occurs at vanishing anisotropy , below which the ground state is uniformly perpendicular to the central curve . </S>",
    "<S> the transition for the mbius ribbon is more subtle ; it occurs at a positive critical value of the anisotropy , below which the ground state is nonuniform . for the helicoid ribbon , the dispersion law for spin wave excitations about the tangential state </S>",
    "<S> is found to exhibit an asymmetry determined by the geometric and magnetic chiralities .    </S>",
