    "when do two individual atoms become a molecule , or vice versa ?",
    "this question is a fundamental one as much for chemistry as for physics .",
    "certainly , it should involve a sort of discontinuity as in phase transition . in this context , p. w. anderson hinted , in his well known article more is different  @xcite , that a condition for a phase transition is the presence of infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "sometimes , these are provided by the environment pastawski2007278 .",
    "many results in dft calculations show an abrupt change in chemical bonds as the molecules approach to the surface of a catalyst and the interaction with the metal increases . in this context ,",
    "a paradigmatic example of molecular formation and dissociation is the heyrovsky reaction @xcite , one of the steps of the hydrogen evolution reaction at metallic electrodes : after the adsorption of a hydrogen atom at the surface , a second proton approaches and an electron is transferred from the metal .",
    "it is in this last step , when the hydrogen molecule is formed and a discontinuity is hinted by dft calculations as a jump in energy and spin polarization .",
    "this occurs at a critical distance of the farthest hydrogen bondbreack - santos-2011-diatomic - molecules .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "a phase transition is recognized as a non - analytic behavior of an observable , typically the ground state energy , as a function of a control parameter .",
    "this phenomenon , absent in a few atoms system , is an emergent property of the thermodynamic limit , i.e. when @xmath2 , the number of atoms or degrees of freedom , tends to infinity . @xcite .",
    "such a limit is used to get the fermi golden rule ( fgr ) . there",
    ", one assigns an infinitesimal imaginary part @xmath3 to each of the @xmath2 involved energies and @xmath4 is made zero only after taking @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus , an initial energy @xmath6 acquires a finite energy uncertainty @xmath7  associated with a decay rate @xmath8 . a straightforward way to account for this decay is to introduce an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian where some energies acquire an imaginary component , e.g. @xmath9 .",
    "while this procedure dates back to e. majorana majorana , its deep physical implications only recently have become evident .",
    "this paper seeks to rationalize the discontinuities found in dft calculations at the light of the quantum dynamical phase transition ( qdpt ) concept @xcite .    a clear experimental evidence of a dynamical transition showed up in nmr experiments in a 2(ch)@xmath10fe crystal .",
    "there , the nuclear spins of the rare @xmath11c-@xmath12h dimers can perform rabi oscillations . beyond some critical crystal orientation ,",
    "these spins are seen to abruptly decouple .",
    "this occurs when the  interaction between the @xmath12h spin and the rest of the crystal becomes stronger than the @xmath11c-@xmath12h one @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is a qdpt and can also be interpreted as a particular case of the superrandiance phenomenon predicted by dicke gross , celardo , liu , hepp , dicke .    as a preliminary idea ,",
    "let us explain how a tight - binding model for a homonuclear diatomic molecule @xmath13 can show a non - analytical discontinuity . as in the spin case discussed above , this simple model would display the concepts relevant for the main discussion .",
    "let @xmath14 be the usual bonding - antibonding splitting .",
    "if atom @xmath15 , has an interaction with a metallic band of width @xmath16 ( wide band approximation ) its energy acquires a finite lifetime @xmath17 due to the tunneling into the metal ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this results in the effective non - hermitian molecular hamiltonian @xcite ,    @xmath19 .\\ ] ]    the eigenenergies are now complex numbers . for small @xmath20",
    "the difference between their real parts is the splitting between the bonding and antibonding molecular levels , @xmath21 ^{2}-\\gamma ^{2}}.$ ] this splitting is now weakened by the interaction with the substrate .",
    "their corresponding imaginary parts @xmath22 are identical .",
    "however , @xmath23 has a non - analytic collapse when @xmath7reaches the critical value @xmath24 beyond this exceptional point ( ep ) @xcite , the real parts become degenerate and the imaginary parts bifurcate . for big @xmath7 values , the eigenvalue associated to @xmath15 has an imaginary part @xmath7 and thus remains strongly mixed with the substrate .",
    "the other one , associated to @xmath25 , has an uncertainty proportional to @xmath26/@xmath7 , indicating an almost isolated orbital @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon underlays the quantum zeno effect @xcite , i.e. when three orbitals interact , a strong interaction between two of them weakens their interaction with the third .",
    "the detailed analytical and numerical solution of the above model was discussed in great detail in the context of qdpt by dente et al .",
    "however , while very appealing for its simplicity , _ this picture can not be directly applied to a typical metallic catalyst _ because it is in a very different physical regime .",
    "indeed , the weak interaction with the wide @xmath27-band does afford for a relevant role in the molecular dissociation .",
    "thus , our attention should turn to the strong interaction of the @xmath0-band with the molecule @xcite , which has long been recognized as responsible for catalysis newnshydrogen - and - dband .",
    "yet the @xmath0-band _ _  _ _ has a width @xmath28 smaller than the molecular level splitting @xmath29 , which prevents using the wide band approximation .",
    "thus , we are back with the question of _ which is the magnitude that shows a non - analyticity that could be associated with a bond breaking in presence of a _",
    "@xmath0__-band ? _ _    in this paper , we answer this question by showing that an actual analytical discontinuity appears if one includes a description of the metallic @xmath0-band with the right degree of detail .",
    "this requires to choose an appropriate combination between the molecular levels and the different metalic layers .",
    "furthermore , the anderson - newns theory of adsorption andersoneli , newnshydrogen - and - dband is needed to describe molecular dissociation and electrocatalysis along with the inclusion of further works that extended this theory @xcite . in our terms , while the molecule approaches to the surface , the farther @xmath25 atom experiences a resonant through - bond coupling @xcite with the 2nd layer of the metal .",
    "this interaction , mediated by the @xmath15 atom and the first surface layer , manifests as two resonances inside the @xmath0-band .",
    "the transition occurs when these resonances collapse at the center of the @xmath0-band , releasing the @xmath25 atom .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath15 atom hybridization with @xmath30 is swapped into a @xmath15-metal bonding .",
    "we consider the heyrovsky reaction , i.e. a h@xmath1 molecule approaching perpendicularly to the metal surface .",
    "the molecule hamiltonian is @xmath31 .",
    "the degeneracy of the atomic energies @xmath32 and @xmath33 is broken by the bonding interaction @xmath34 . according to the standard wisdom @xcite",
    "the @xmath35 ( top ) or combination of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( for hollow sites ) are the only @xmath0-orbitals with a finite overlap with the molecule .",
    "the orbital @xmath38 interacts with the closest @xmath0-orbital combination , say @xmath39 , pointing along the connecting path through the binding energy @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath42 is roughly an exponential function of the molecule - substrate distance .",
    "therefore , the complete hamiltonian becomes @xmath43 .",
    "let us now focus on @xmath44 which describes the @xmath0-band .",
    "since the newns pioneering work @xcite , it is usually assumed that a semi - elliptical shape is a good approximation for the local density of states ( ldos ) :    @xmath45 \\times \\theta \\left [ 2\\varepsilon -w_{d}\\right ] ,   \\label{e4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 $ ] is the heaviside function .",
    "indeed , the validity of this proposal for an actual metal , can be visualized through the lanczos transformation@xcite .",
    "this is a unitary transformation which maps the actual @xmath47 substrate into an equivalent @xmath48 linear chain .",
    "[ lanczos ] represents this procedure for a @xmath49 case .",
    "starting from the @xmath39 surface @xmath0-orbital , a sequence of collective orbitals  is build up mainly from the atomic orbitals at layers progressively distant from the original surface orbital . regardless of the precise original hamiltonian @xmath44 ,",
    "in the lanczos basis the metal hamiltonian @xmath50 has identical site  energies @xmath51 and only nearest neighbor interactions @xmath52 s that account for the coupling among the lanczos collective states haydock1972electronic .",
    "their rapid convergence to @xmath53 justifies the newns proposal of a homogeneous linear chain to describe the actual metal .",
    "the kets @xmath54 are the collective @xmath0-orbitals , now  the @xmath55th site of the metallic chain . since in the surface of the metal the coupling between layers is weaker than in the bulk we assume @xmath56 and we set @xmath57 @xmath58for @xmath59     metal .",
    "the lanczos unitary transformation combines orbitals at the same distance .",
    "the resulting tridiagonal hamiltonian can be represented as a linear chain .",
    "a decimation procedure leads to a @xmath60 non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to the @xmath47 metal .",

    "@xmath63    with the purpose to define an optimal configuration for the molecular dissociation we will base our model in the anderson - newns theory and set up the fermi energy level at @xmath64 the center of the @xmath0-band , thus @xmath65 . thus the molecular bonding  @xmath66 yields a symmetric splitting around the center of the band . additionally , we will set the coupling elements @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 which results fairly representative of various situations @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is necessary to list some of the main approximations implied by this model : 1 ) the fixed value of @xmath66 neglects the variation of the distance between the atoms @xmath25 and @xmath15 .",
    "this does not affect our main results since the molecule breaking can be viewed as a competence among interactions 2 ) as usual the atoms in the metal are considered fixed in the whole problem .",

    ". a residual exponentially small interaction would be completely masked by the through - bond interaction .",
    "the solution of a linear chain model is better expressed in terms of the retarded green s function matrix @xmath70 , whose divergences occur at the hamiltonian eigenstates . for example , in absence of the metal we have :    @xmath71    clearly , @xmath32 , the isolated @xmath25 atom energy , is modified by the presence of @xmath15 through the self - energy @xmath72 a real function accounting for the bonding and providing for the exact molecular eigenstates . as discussed before",
    ", one uses @xmath73 ( for @xmath74 ) .",
    "this regularization energy @xmath4 facilitates the study of the spectral density and the retarded charge dynamics , and whose physical origin can be traced back to small  environmental interactions , as with the infinite @xmath27-band states@xcite .",
    "when the molecule is coupled with the metal in presence of the infinitesimal environment , one gets the retarded green s function @xcite :     here , @xmath75 is the self - energy correction describing the bulk of the metal @xmath0-band in the lanczos representation :    @xmath76    from now on we set @xmath77 thus , the solution of eq .

    "the ldos is obtained from the imaginary part of the green s function @xmath84 .$ ]    the imaginary part of the self - energy accounts for the quantum diffusion of the electrons in the metallic substrate .",
    "notice that the imaginary parts of the self - energy , @xmath85 , and the continuum spectrum are already consequences of taking the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many sites in the chain .",
    "otherwise @xmath75 would be a collection of divergences at discrete eigenenergies as @xmath86 . within the @xmath0-band ,",
    "the imaginary part survives the limit @xmath87 indicating that each atomic orbitals merges into the metallic band anderson1978local .",
    "however , the mere existence of @xmath88 does not warrant the qdpt . in this narrow band limit",
    ", a qdpt emerges as consequence of the specific non - linear dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath89 on @xmath90 that accounts for the different metal layers .",
    "now , the important distinction respect to the introductory example is that the self - energies acquire a non - linear dependence on @xmath91 that contains all the wealth of the molecule - catalyst interaction . finding the corresponding energy spectrum involves a 4th order polynomial on @xmath90 with complex coefficients .",
    "a simple procedure is to find the eight complex roots of @xmath92 .",
    "half of them are non - physical as they are divergences for @xmath93 but not for @xmath94 .",

    "as in the quantum zeno effect , increasing this interaction would dissociate the @xmath25 atom from the rest of the system @xcite .",
    "this does not preclude a small amount of tunneling of @xmath25 into the substrate s second layer passing through the orbitals @xmath15 and 1 .",
    "for intermediate @xmath40 , this originates a through - bond interaction levstein - damato that favors the formation of a bonding state between @xmath108 and  @xmath109 , as well as an antibonding one(@xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively ) .",
