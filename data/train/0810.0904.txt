    "superconducting / ferromagnetic ( @xmath0 ) hybrid structures give rise to a fascinating interplay between two antagonist electronic orders .",
    "the ferromagnetic exchange field @xmath1 privileges one spin direction while standard superconductivity favors singlet correlations .",
    "this leads to a rich behavior which has triggered an intense activity in the last years ( see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "in particular , the  superconducting proximity effect  , i.e. the propagation of the superconducting correlations in ferromagnets , has been widely studied .",
    "this propagation is accompanied by spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter , because @xmath1 induces an energy shift between electrons and holes . as a result",
    ", one can build electronic devices with new functionalities , such as josephson junctions with negative critical currents@xcite , which could find applications in the field of superconducting circuits@xcite . from a fundamental point of view , it is very instructive to study the density of states ( dos ) of @xmath0 structures .",
    "so far , this quantity has been less measured@xcite than critical temperatures or supercurrents . however , this way of probing the superconducting proximity effect is very interesting because it provides spectroscopic information .",
    "one striking consequence of the spatial oscillations of the order parameter in the @xmath2 layer is that the zero - energy dos can become larger than in the normal state for certain ferromagnet thicknesses@xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 hybrid circuits depends crucially on the properties of the interfaces between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 materials . in this paper , we focus on the case of diffusive structures .",
    "diffusive @xmath0 interfaces have been initially described with spin - independent boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "it has been found that the amplitude of the superconducting proximity effect directly depends on the tunnel conductance @xmath4 of an interface ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "later , spin - dependent boundary conditions have been introduced , in the limit of a weakly polarized ferromagnet@xcite . due to the spin - dependence of interfacial phase shifts ( sdips)@xcite",
    ", one has to take into account new conductance parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the @xmath2 and @xmath3 sides of the interface , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath5 and @xmath6 can significantly affect the behavior of @xmath0 hybrid circuits .",
    "for instance , @xmath5 can shift the spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter@xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been found that @xmath6 can induce an effective zeeman splitting @xmath7 in a superconducting layer with a thickness @xmath8 smaller than the superconducting coherence lengthscale @xmath9@xcite .",
    "this induces a double gap structure ( dgs ) in the @xmath3 and @xmath2 densities of states .",
    "however , in practice , the regime @xmath10 is frequently reached ( see e.g. refs .  ) . remarkably , dgss have been recently observed at the @xmath2 side of bilayers with @xmath8 much larger than @xmath9@xcite , although ref .",
    "has found that @xmath7 scales with @xmath11 in the low @xmath8 regime .",
    "whether a dgs persists in the large @xmath8 regime is therefore an important question , especially in the light of this recent experiment .    in this paper",
    ", we study how @xmath5 and @xmath6 modify the dos of a @xmath0 bilayer .",
    "we use a numerical treatment to explore a wider parameter range than in previous works .",
    "in particular , we can reach the limit of thick superconductors and larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "we find that @xmath12 shifts the spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter in @xmath2 , like @xmath5 .",
    "it can also significantly affect the amplitude of the superconducting gap .",
    "when @xmath8 increases , the sdips - induced dgs becomes narrower , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "nevertheless , it can surprisingly persist in the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "indeed , on a distance of the order of @xmath9 near the @xmath0 interface , the resonance energies of the @xmath3 spectrum remain spin - dependent because quantum interferences make the superconducting correlations sensitive to the sdips .",
    "this behavior is transmitted to the whole @xmath2 layer due to the superconducting proximity effect .",
    "we thus obtain , at the @xmath2 side of @xmath0 bilayers , dos curves which have interesting similarities with those of ref .  , although @xmath13 .",
    "more generally , our results could be useful for interpreting experiments .",

    "section iii explains the principle of our numerical treatment .",
    "section iv presents a detailed study of the sdips - induced dgs .",

    "the terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be finite only in case of a spin - dependence of interfacial phase shifts ( sdips ) .",

    "thus , in principle , any kind of @xmath0 interface can have a finite sdips .",
    "however , the exact values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are difficult to predict because they depend on the detailed microscopic structure of the interface .",
    "one possible approach is to consider @xmath5 and @xmath12 as fitting parameters which have to be determined from proximity effect measurements .",
    "note that the derivation of the boundary conditions ( [ bcright]-[bcleft ] ) assumes a weak transmission probability per channel ( tunnel limit ) , which seems reasonable considering the band structure mismatch between most @xmath3 and @xmath2 materials .",

    "can occur when the circuit includes several @xmath2 electrodes or domains with non - colinear magnetizations@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found that this effect can also arise in @xmath0 circuits with spin - active interfaces , due to spin - flip interfacial coupling terms which are due e.g. to some misaligned local moments at the @xmath0 interface@xcite . in our work",
    ", we consider interfaces which are `` spin - active '' in the sense that the sdips is finite .",

    "in the data of sangiorgio et al . , from @xmath156   to @xmath174  , the distance between the two peaks of the dgs increases , like in our model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , left panel ) .",
    "however , the outer peak of the dgs remains very close to @xmath131 , which seems difficult to reproduce with our model .",
    "note that in ref .",
    ", for @xmath175  , the outer peaks of the dos are inverted , whereas a sharp dip occurs at low energies , which can give the impression that the innner peaks of the dos persist but are not inverted , in contrast to what we find ( see section iv.b ) . however , we think that the observation of this zero - bias dip is not totally reliable . indeed , sangiorgio et al .",
    "explain that , in the dos of their thickest samples ( for @xmath176  ) , `` the zero bias peak is due to the steep voltage dependence of the background conductance and is therefore a by - product of the data normalization procedure '' .",
    "the zero bias - dip of the @xmath175   sample occurs on the same energy scale as these zero - bias peaks , and it goes together with a strange zero - bias singularity similar to those shown by the thickest samples .",
    "therefore , we are not sure whether a proper interpretation of the data of ref",
    ".   must take into account this feature .",
    "suggests that the dgs observed by sangiorgio could be due to triplet correlations .",
    "however , it is difficult to know whether this interpretation can be more satisfying than ours because ref .",
    "does not shown any quantitative interpretation of the data and does not discuss , for instance , the evolution of the inner and outer peak positions with @xmath90 .    , and our numerical calculation with @xmath177  , @xmath158  , @xmath178  , @xmath179 , @xmath94 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath170 , @xmath180   and @xmath164 .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the density of states ( dos ) in a diffusive superconducting / ferromagnetic ( @xmath0 ) bilayer with a spin - active interface .",
    "we have used a self - consistent numerical treatment to make a systematic study of the effects of the spin - dependence of interfacial phase shifts ( sdips ) .",
    "we characterize the sdips with two conductance - like parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 , which occur in the boundary conditions describing the @xmath3 and @xmath2 sides of the interface , respectively .",
    "we find that the amplitude of @xmath31 significantly decreases if @xmath6 is too strong , whereas it is almost insensitive to @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , both @xmath6 and @xmath5 can shift the oscillations of the zero - energy dos of @xmath2 with the thickness of @xmath2 .",
    "remarkably , we find that the sdips can produce a double gap structure in the dos of @xmath2 , even when the @xmath3 layer is much thicker than the superconducting coherence lenght .",
    "this leads to dos curves which have striking similarities with those of ref .  .",
