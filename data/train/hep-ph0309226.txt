    "the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath7 of the muon is one of a few physical parameters which can be determined with high precision and therefore can serve as precision test for the standard model of elementary particle physics . in this paper",
    "we join the attempts to determine the hadronic contribution of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with a better accuracy ( for an overview over the status of calculations of different collaborations two years ago see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . while the dominant qed contribution @xmath8 and the weak contribution @xmath9 are known with very good accuracy ( see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , the main uncertainty is given by the hadronic contribution .",
    "as an example for the actual calculations of the leading order hadronic contribution we cite the value @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon mostly relies on experimental data in the @xmath11 channel . in principle",
    "one can also make use of data from @xmath12-decay  @xcite .",
    "however , the inclusion of @xmath12-decay data introduces systematic uncertainties originating from isospin symmetry breaking effects which are difficult to estimate  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore decided to only include @xmath11 data in our analysis .",
    "there are different concepts for using the @xmath11 data sets , either to its full extent  @xcite or in part by dividing the energy range into resonance regions close to the pair production thresholds where the experimental values are taken and those regions far from thresholds where perturbation theory is assumed to be valid . in this paper",
    "we present an approach which has been successfully applied for the determination of the running fine structure constant at the @xmath13 boson resonance , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the subject of a precision determination of the anomalous magnetic moment became rather important again as a precision measurement for the positive muon could be accomplished at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )  @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath15 cited in ref .",
    "@xcite showed a deviation from the standard model prediction at that time , @xmath16 as weighted average over the calculation results of different collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the deviation was @xmath17 standard deviations which seemed to have opened the window for new physics .",
    "many such suggestions were published , including concepts of supersymmetry , leptoquarks , lepton number violating models , technicolor models , string theory concepts , extra dimensions and so on .",
    "the discrepancy between measurement and the standard model prediction became smaller , though , when a sign error was discovered in the theoretical calculation of the light - by - light contribution  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worth still to analyze the situation of the standard model prediction thoroughly , giving special emphasis on the error estimate , in order to compare it with the experimental world average @xmath18 which is dominated by the measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite , as we will do in this paper .",
    "the leading hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath19 can be extracted from the @xmath20 vertex correction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the analytic expression for @xmath19 from this diagram is a weighted dispersion integral over the imaginary part of the vector part of the hadronic vacuum polarisation , @xmath21 with the qed kernel @xmath22 as usual we make use of the kinematic variables @xmath23    @xmath24 is calculated from the hadronic current - current correlator , @xmath25    higher perturbative qcd corrections are well - known up to @xmath26 with @xmath27 quark mass corrections which are supplemented by massless terms up to @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "this perturbative part is denoted by @xmath29 . for brevity",
    "we only cite the first few terms of this expansion in @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32\\ ] ] with @xmath33 . in our analysis",
    "we use the full @xmath34 expression given in ref .",
    "the number of active flavours is denoted by @xmath35 which changes according to the energy interval under consideration . for the zeroth order term in the @xmath31 expansion we have included the known higher order terms in @xmath30 , @xmath36\\ ] ] with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we have denoted the yet unknown constant term in the four - loop contribution by @xmath40 which , however , does not contribute to our calculations since it has no absorption part .    for the nonperturbative part the operator product expansion leads to  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are @xmath45 colour factors .",
    "we will use these results for the evaluation of the theoretical contributions .",
    "the evaluation of the integral involves experimental data via the optical theorem which connects the imaginary part of the vacuum polarisation with the ratio @xmath46 especially in the @xmath47 and the low @xmath48 energy range and in regions of resonances where perturbative qcd can not be applied , data sets taken from experimental measurements are crucial . for our evaluation",
    "we have used the combined @xmath11 data sets from ref .",
    "@xcite and complement them in the dominant low energy range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 by recent two pion data  @xcite . by comparing with the new data for three and four pion decays  @xcite one ensures that their influence for the sub @xmath48-range where the two pion data were recorded is neglible .",
    "all data sets are combined by weighting their relative contribution to the total experimental value with the corresponding statistic and systematic errors .",
    "global duality states that qcd can be used in weighted integrals over a spectral function if the spectral function is multiplied by polynomial functions . however , this does not work if the polynomial function is replaced by a singular function such as the weight @xmath51 in the present case .",
    "nevertheless , local duality is expected to hold for large values of @xmath52 far from resonances and threshold regions , i.e.@xmath53 .    in our approach",
    "we attempt to reduce the influence of experimental @xmath3 data in regions where the data has large uncertainties .",
    "specifically , this holds for the interval between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the essence of our method is to diminish the magnitude of the weight function by subtracting a polynomial function which mimics the weight function at those energies . in order to compensate for this subtraction , the same polynomial function",
    "is added again , but now its contribution is evaluated by using global duality on a circular contour in the complex plane , according to @xmath54.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the usual procedure to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ disper ] ) is to use the experimental cross section up to some high momentum transfer and to calculate the remaining part from qcd using local duality .",
    "indeed , in the energy region up to @xmath55 we use the @xmath11 cross section data set from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding dispersion integral reads @xmath56    \\frac{k(s)}sds.\\ ] ] narrow resonances are added in explicit form . in eq .",
    "( [ breitwigner ] ) the missing resonances are parametrized by a breit - wigner fit @xmath57 and added to the remaining data sets .    in the subsequent interval from @xmath1 to @xmath2 the relevant @xmath11 data from refs .",
    "@xcite , combined with data sets from the bes collaboration  @xcite , can be efficiently replaced by theoretical input from qcd . by subtracting a polynomial function from the weight function @xmath51",
    "we reduce the experimental input in this energy interval .",
    "since the polynomial function is an analytic function in the whole complex plane , the remaining contribution can be evaluated off the real axis on a circular contour in the complex plane using perturbative and nonperturbative qcd results , @xmath58p_n(s)ds\\nonumber\\\\ & &    + \\frac{4\\alpha^2}{\\pi}\\frac1{2\\pi i}\\oint_{|s_1|=(1.2{{\\rm\\,gev}})^2 }    \\left[\\pi^{\\rm p}(s)+\\pi^{\\rm np}(s)\\right]p_n(s)ds\\nonumber\\\\[3pt ]    & = & ( a_\\mu^{\\rm exp})_2+(a_\\mu^{\\rm the})_2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is taken for this interval .    at first glance",
    "the polynomial degree @xmath60 seems to be arbitrary .",
    "however , if @xmath60 is chosen too large , both the theoretical error from the strong coupling @xmath61 and from unknown nonperturbative contributions arising from higher order condensates lead to larger uncertainties",
    ".    moreover , we have to ensure that the calculated value is stable with respect of the variations of the lower polynomial degrees @xmath60 where the less known contributions from condensates are negligible .",
    "this point will help us find an optimal energy domain for our method .",
    "an optimal choice for the polynomial degree should guarantee a good approximation of the polynomial function to the weight function and thus effectively replace the experimental data by theoretical input while reducing the total uncertainty from this region to a minimum .    above @xmath2 the @xmath11 data in ref .",
    "@xcite show low uncertainties and can be integrated directly , @xmath62    \\frac{k(s)}{s}ds.\\ ] ] in the last step the high energy tail starting from @xmath63 can be calculated from theory using local duality .",
    "this is reasonable since there are no resonance contributions above @xmath63 . in this region",
    "it is sufficient to use the lowest order contribution given by @xmath64    .[tab1]contributions to @xmath65 for different fitting polynomial functions @xmath66 with degree @xmath60 .",
    "the purely experimental and theoretical contributions according to eq .",
    "( [ split ] ) are listed separately . because the error estimate becomes worse for @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] ) , polynomial degrees @xmath68 and @xmath69 are used to obtain a mean value and a methodical error estimate , @xmath70 . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented an alternative determination of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon where we have made use of theoretical qcd results to reduce the influence of the poor experimental data in the range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis includes the leading and next - to - leading contribution .    using the polynomial method in the range between @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", we could suppress the influence of experimental data effectively and thereby reduce the error on the determination of @xmath19 .",
    "note that using this method we were able to use a value for the lower limit of this range lower than usually used for pure qcd methods .",
    "using only @xmath11 data and qcd as input , we obtain a result which is @xmath71 away from the measured world average , stating that the deviation between theory and experiment may be smaller than commonly suggested .",
