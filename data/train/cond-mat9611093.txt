    "the growth of thin films in molecular beam epitaxy involves atom diffusion on the surface and nucleation of islands , followed by aggregation and coalescence .",
    "the resulting morphology is found to depend on the detailed nature of microscopic diffusion processes on the substrate , as well as the deposition rate and substrate temperature .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has revealed a variety of morphologies in the submonolayer regime .",
    "compact islands of nearly square shape have been observed for homoepitaxial growth on fcc(001 ) substrates such as ni(001 ) and cu(001 ) @xcite .",
    "fractal - like islands which resemble diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite clusters have been observed in systems such as au on ru(0001 ) @xcite while pt on pt(111 ) was found to exhibit both fractal - like shapes and more compact , nearly triangular shapes @xcite .",
    "experimental studies and theoretical work using monte carlo simulations have shown that the submonolayer morphology depends on the rates of various diffusion processes on the substrate .",
    "in particular , systems which exhibit high atom mobility along island edges ( typically on square substrates ) tend to form compact islands .",
    "low edge mobility gives rise to islands with dla - like shapes ( typically on hexagonal substrates ) .",
    "these morphologies are important beyond the submonolayer since they affect the multilayer growth mode of the film .",
    "the island morphology also affects the schwoebel barrier @xcite for an atom deposited on top of an island to hop down the step .",
    "when this barrier is large islands tend to nucleate on top of islands resulting in three dimensional growth mode while a small barrier gives rise to layer by layer growth .",
    "scaling properties of island growth have been studied experimentally using statistical analysis of stm data and helium beam scattering @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have applied rate equations @xcite as well as monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "it was found that for a broad class of systems a short transient regime is followed by a quasi - steady state where a scaling relation of the form @xmath7 applies , where @xmath8 is the island density , @xmath9 is the flux or deposition rate and @xmath10 is the adatom diffusion coefficient ( note that the hopping rate for an isolated adatom is @xmath11 due to the four possible directions for hopping ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 depends on microscopic properties such as the stability @xcite and mobility @xcite of small islands , isotropic vs. anisotropic diffusion @xcite and the existence of magic islands ( namely , islands which are stable while larger islands are unstable ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that for systems in which the smallest stable island is of size @xmath12 ( where islands of size @xmath13 dissociate ) , in the asymptotic limit of slow deposition rate , for isotropic diffusion , @xmath14 .",
    "experimentally , it was found that @xmath5 may depend on temperature @xcite .",
    "for example , for fcc(001 ) surfaces a transition from @xmath15 to @xmath16 due to temperature increase was characterized , where the transition temperature is determined by the ratio between the aggregation and dissociation rates of dimers and trimers @xcite .",
    "the island size distribution was also studied and found to depend on @xmath17 .",
    "these studies revealed that scaling properties can be used to identify microscopic processes at the atomic level and to estimate various activation energies which are difficult to measure .",
    "experimental measurements of some diffusion processes at the atomic level are possible using field ion microscopy .",
    "this technique was used to identify diffusion modes for small islands such as dimers and trimers on fcc(001 ) metal surfaces and to measure their diffusion coefficients @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the relation between the scaling and morphology of the growing islands and trace them to properties of the microscopic model .",
    "in particular , we examine the effect of the _ mobility _ of small islands on island morphology and scaling . to this end",
    "we introduce a class of three microscopic models on a square substrate which differ in their diffusion properties . in model",
    "i only single atoms ( monomers ) are mobile [ which means that the energy barrier for breaking a nearest neighbor ( nn ) or next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) bond is practically infinite ] . in model ii both monomers and dimers ( clusters of two atoms ) are mobile while in model iii monomers , dimers and trimers ( clusters of three atoms ) are mobile .",
    "an island is defined as a cluster of adatoms connected by nn or nnn bonds .",
    "the island size @xmath18 is the number of atoms in the island . in this paper",
    "we do not consider island instability but only island mobility .",
    "therefore we define the critical island size @xmath6 as the size for which all islands of size @xmath2 are mobile while islands of size @xmath3 are immobile .",
    "thus , @xmath19 and @xmath1 for models i , ii and iii respectively .",
    "note that in the models considered here islands are stable even for @xmath2 in the sense that there is no detachment of atoms from islands .",
    "however , due to their mobility these small islands tend to collide and merge into other islands .",
    "the models we consider involve only local ( nn and nnn ) interactions such that the hopping rate for an atom in each of the four possible directions is determined by the occupancy in a neighborhood of @xmath20 sites around it .",
    "we show that in this type of models there is a correlation between mobility of small islands and edge mobility . in model i ,",
    "once an adatom attaches to an island edge as a nn it can not move and therefore edge mobility is completely suppressed .",
    "model ii allows very limited edge mobility while model iii allows more moves including hopping around a corner of an island .",
    "as the edge mobility increases islands become more compact because it tends to suppress narrow fingers and allows the atoms to find more stable positions with more nearest and next nearest neighbors .",
    "the correlation between mobility of small islands and edge mobility gives rise to a relation between the scaling properties determined by the critical island size and the morphology which depends on the edge mobility . to quantify this relation",
    "we first obtain the scaling exponent @xmath5 for the three models using both rate equations and mc simulations .",
    "we then examine the island morphology for the three models and apply a fractal analysis using the box counting algorithm and mass dimension evaluation @xcite .",
    "the box counting function , in the scaling regime , can be described by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the box size , @xmath23 is the number of boxes which contain at least one atom , @xmath24 is the box counting fractal dimension and @xmath25 is the prefactor .",
    "we find that the fractal dimension @xmath24 is rather insensitive to the differences between the models .",
    "the prefactor @xmath25 , however , provides a quantitative measure of the different morphologies .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained for the mass dimension @xmath26 and its prefactor @xmath27 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the models are introduced in section ii . scaling properties of island growth and their dependence on the microscopic model",
    "are presented in section iii .",
    "the morphologies are examined in section iv , followed by discussion in section v and a summary in section vi .",
    "to study the scaling and morphology during island growth we introduce three models of diffusion on the square lattice .",
    "submonolayer thin film growth during deposition in molecular beam epitaxy is then studied using kinetic mc simulations @xcite . in these simulations atoms",
    "are deposited randomly on the square substrate at a rate @xmath9 [ given in monolayers ( ml ) per second ] and hop according to the microscopic model . the hopping rate @xmath10 ( in units of hops per second ) for a given atom to each unoccupied nn site is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 is the attempt frequency , @xmath31 is the energy barrier , @xmath32 is the boltzmann factor and @xmath33 is the temperature .",
    "the coverage after time @xmath34 is then @xmath35 ( in ml ) .    in our mc simulations moves",
    "are selected randomly from the list of all possible moves at the given time with the appropriate weights .",
    "the time is then advanced according to the inverse of the sum of all rates . in the models used here the energy barrier @xmath31 for hopping is determined by the local environment in a @xmath20 square around the hopping atom ( fig .",
    "1 ) , where the occupancy of seven adjacent sites , @xmath36 is taken into account . each one of these sites can be either occupied ( @xmath37 ) or vacant ( @xmath38 ) giving rise to @xmath39 barriers . to index them we use the binary representation where the energy barriers are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . using this indexing",
    "we introduce three models of nearest neighbor hopping on the surface ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in model",
    "i only monomers are mobile , in model ii dimers are also mobile and model iii includes mobility of trimers as well . to simplify the analysis , our models include only one hopping rate , obtained by assigning the same activation energy ( @xmath43 @xmath44 ) to all the allowed moves and a very high ( practically infinite ) energy barrier for all moves which are not allowed in the given model .",
    "the models are minimal in the sense that they include only the minimal set of moves required to achieve the specified island mobility .",
    "some more moves can be added without modifying @xmath6 ( see section v ) .",
    "note that in our models there is no additional barrier for hopping down a step , which is justified for small islands and especially for fractal - like ones @xcite .",
    "atoms deposited on top of an island hop until they hit the edge and hop down to be incorporated into the island .",
    "nucleation of a second layer is thus suppressed .",
    "the models are used to perform a systematic study of the effects of mobility of small islands on the scaling and morphology of the growing islands .",
    "the three models are introduced below .",
    "in this model only monomers can move [ fig .",
    "[ moves ] ( a ) ] .",
    "atoms can not move away from nn or nnn atoms while they can move towards a nnn atom making it a nn ( moves @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ moves ] ) .",
    "the latter moves are included to enhance adatom association and the creation of islands .",
    "( note that in this model none of the allowed moves involve bond breaking . )      here both monomers and dimers are mobile .",
    "in addition to the moves included in model i two new moves are added [ figure [ moves ] ( b ) ] .",
    "dimer mobility is now possible via a combination of a bond - breaking ( moves @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) and a bond building move ( moves @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) .",
    "these additional moves introduce more channels for island rearrangements which lead to a more compact island shape [ fig .",
    "[ addmoves ] ( a ) ] .      in this model trimers",
    "are mobile , too .",
    "four moves are added to those present in model ii ( moves @xmath1 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) . which are required for trimer mobility [ fig .",
    "2 ( c ) ] . they also enhance the mobility of atoms on island edges , and in particular allow for an edge adatom to move around a corner [ fig .",
    "[ addmoves ] ( b ) ] .",
    "note , however that edge mobility in this model is still highly limited .",
    "for example , an atom adjacent to a straight long edge is immobile even in model iii .      to confirm that the critical island size is indeed @xmath53 for models i , ii and iii respectively , and to obtain the diffusion coefficients of mobile islands in each model we have done simulations of single cluster diffusion . to obtain the statistics required for a precise determination of the diffusion coefficients we performed 1000 runs for monomers , dimers , trimers and tetramers ( islands of four atoms ) in each of the three models .",
    "each run was carried out to time equal to @xmath54 seconds , which is about @xmath55 times larger than the time scale for hopping at the given temperature ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficients were obtained from the relation @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the distance between the initial position of the center of mass of the cluster and its position after time @xmath34 , @xmath60 is the diffusion coefficient for a cluster of size @xmath18 and @xmath61 represents an average over the 1000 runs .",
    "the diffusion coefficients for monomers , dimers , trimers and tetramers in each of the three models are shown in table [ tab : hopping ] @xcite .",
    "our expectations are confirmed , namely , that in model i only monomers are mobile , in model ii dimers are mobile as well and in model iii also trimers are mobile .",
    "the submonolayer growth is typically divided into three stages - the early stage is dominated by island nucleation followed by an aggregation - dominated stage until coalescence sets in . in the aggregation stage",
    "the density of stable islands @xmath8 , exhibits power law behavior as a function of the ratio between the deposition rate and the adatom hopping rate of the form @xmath62 .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 is determined by the microscopic processes that are activated on the surface during growth . in case where all clusters of size @xmath2 are mobile ,",
    "while larger clusters are immobile , the asymptotic value of @xmath5 in the limit where @xmath63 is given by @xcite : @xmath64 this result is exact if all mobile islands have the same diffusion coefficient , namely @xmath65 , @xmath66 . still , it is a good approximation if all the diffusion coefficients are of the same order of magnitude and the ratios between them are independent of the temperature , as is the case for the models studied in this paper .    to study the scaling properties of island growth with mobility of small islands , for experimentally relevant deposition rates , we introduce a set of rate equations which describe the time evolution of the densities of mobile and immobile islands . in these equations ,",
    "islands including @xmath18 atoms are mobile for @xmath67 with diffusion coefficient @xmath60 and immobile for @xmath68 .",
    "the density of mobile islands of size @xmath18 is given by @xmath69 , @xmath67 , while the total density of immobile islands is given by @xmath8 .",
    "both densities are normalized per lattice site and the lattice constant is taken to be @xmath70 .",
    "the rate equations take the form    [ set : mobil_f ] @xmath71    where the density of immobile islands @xmath8 , is given by @xmath72 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ set : mobil_f - adatoms ] ) describes the deposition of new atoms , while the first term in ( [ set : mobil_f - clusters ] ) describes the building of mobile islands by merging of two mobile islands of smaller sizes .",
    "the second and third terms in eqs.([set : mobil_f - adatoms ] ) and ( [ set : mobil_f - clusters ] ) describe the reduction in the number of mobile islands of size @xmath18 due to their collision with other mobile and immobile islands , respectively .",
    "the third equation describes the rate of nucleation of immobile islands due to collision of two mobile islands .",
    "a rate equation representation of models i , ii and iii can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ set : mobil_f ] ) when @xmath73 and @xmath1 respectively and with the diffusion coefficients @xmath74 given in table i. note that the rate equations provide a mean field description ignoring spatial correlations",
    ". moreover , since we concentrate here on the effects of mobility of small islands , other processes such as atom detachment from islands , atoms deposited on top of islands and coalescence are not included in the equations .",
    "also , for simplicity , the capture number is taken as a constant .",
    "in general , it is found to depend on both the island size and the coverage @xcite .",
    "we have examined eqs .",
    "( [ set : mobil_f ] ) in the aggregation regime using asymptotic analysis of the type described in ref",
    ". @xcite . in this analysis eqs .",
    "( [ set : mobil_f ] ) are written in dimensionless form using @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we then consider the aggregation stage ( @xmath80 ) assuming that @xmath81 .",
    "since at this stage the density of mobile islands is approximately constant we solve eqs .",
    "( [ set : mobil_f ] ) in its dimensionless form for @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "this is done using the ansatz that @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants to be determined from the solution . solving for the leading order in each equation we find scaling relations for the densities of immobile and mobile islands as a function of @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite :    [ set : mobil - scaling ] @xmath91    for models i , ii and iii we find @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that these results are only asymptotically exact in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "numerical integration of the rate equations shows slow convergence to these results as the deposition rate is lowered . in table",
    "[ tab : scaling ] we present the values for @xmath5 obtained from numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ set : mobil_f ] ) with diffusion coefficients @xmath74 , taken from table [ tab : hopping ] , together with the asymptotic values .    to complement these results we have also examined the scaling of island density @xmath8 vs. deposition rate @xmath9 , using mc simulations ( fig .",
    "[ scaling ] ) .",
    "the island density obtained in these simulations for the three models , as a function of deposition rate , is shown in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] for coverage of @xmath95 and substrate temperature @xmath56 .",
    "each data point in this figure represents an average over 100 runs and the lattice size is @xmath96 in all the runs .",
    "the values of @xmath5 for the three models , obtained from the mc results in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] are summarized in table [ tab : scaling ] .",
    "it is observed that @xmath5 increases as @xmath6 is increased and this trend appears in all three columns of table [ tab : scaling ] representing the asymptotic result , rate equations and mc simulations .",
    "this can be intuitively understood from the following qualitative argument . in the limit of very fast deposition rate ( say @xmath97 )",
    "the effect of island mobility is negligible and the island density is very large and nearly independent of @xmath6 . as @xmath89 is decreased the mobility of single atoms and islands of size @xmath2 gives rise to nucleation of fewer and larger islands .",
    "this process is enhanced as @xmath6 increases , since it adds more channels for collision and merging of islands .",
    "this results in a faster decrease of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "the values of @xmath5 for rate equation integration at a finite rate are found to be lower than the asymptotic value .",
    "the @xmath5 values for mc simulations are higher than the corresponding rate equation values which can be attributed to spatial correlations and coalescence which are not taken into account in the rate equations .",
    "wolf @xcite proposed an alternative formula for the exponent @xmath5 which takes into account the fractal dimension of the islands denoted by @xmath98 .",
    "adapted to our case it takes the form @xmath99 which coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) for compact islands ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "note that eq.([eq : fract_gamma ] ) implies that @xmath5 for fractal islands is larger than for compact islands with the same @xmath17 , giving rise to lower densities of islands @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable since fractal islands have a larger effective area per given mass .",
    "thus , they inhibit more efficiently new nucleation events , which results in a smaller island density , @xmath8 .",
    "since the numerical simulations generate fractal - like islands while the rate equations assume point - like ( and thus compact ) islands this might provide further explanation for tendency of the mc exponents to be larger than the exponents obtained from numerical integration of the rate equations .",
    "the scaling properties of the island size distribution have been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "these studies indicated that the island size distribution strongly depends on the stability and mobility of small islands and is modified in the case of magic islands @xcite .",
    "the scaled island size distributions for models i , ii and iii are presented in fig .",
    "5(a - c ) .",
    "here @xmath101 is the average island size .",
    "for all three models the deposition rates are @xmath102 @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 @xmath103 ( ) and @xmath106 @xmath103 ( @xmath107 ) . we observe that as @xmath6 increases the peaks rise more slowly on the left hand size ( small @xmath108 ) due to the depletion of the mobile islands .",
    "they also fall off more sharply on the right hand side and thus become narrower .",
    "this trend is qualitatively similar to previous results for the case where small islands are unstable .",
    "note that the peak height increases considerably as @xmath9 decreases .",
    "this may be due to coalescence which is found to become more pronounce as the deposition rate decreases .",
    "coalescence causes @xmath101 to increase , pushing up the scaled island size distribution which includes the factor @xmath109 .",
    "to examine the relation between mobility of small islands and island morphology we have performed extensive mc simulations of island growth using the three models described above .",
    "the morphology of the growing islands is shown in fig .",
    "[ snaps ] for deposition rate @xmath110 , coverage @xmath95 and @xmath56 .",
    "the morphology obtained for model i [ fig . [ snaps ] ( a ) ] best resembles the shape of small dla clusters grown on the square lattice , due to the suppressed edge mobility .",
    "the islands of models ii and iii [ fig .",
    "[ snaps ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ] exhibit wider arms and have more compact shapes due to edge mobility associated with the increased @xmath17 . to quantify these observations",
    "we have performed fractal analysis of the island morphology using the box counting algorithm and mass dimension evaluation for the three models . in the box counting technique one",
    "divides the lattice into boxes of linear size @xmath22 and counts the number of boxes @xmath111 ( averaged over a series or runs ) which intersect the set of islands .",
    "the box counting dimension @xmath24 is then given by @xmath112 where @xmath25 is a prefactor .",
    "the box counting function @xmath23 for the three models is shown in fig .",
    "[ boxc ] on a @xmath113 scale .",
    "the fractal dimensions are presented in table [ tab : d_b ] and the prefactors in table [ tab : a_b ] .",
    "it is shown that although the three models generate different looking morphologies the box counting dimension @xmath24 for a given deposition rate and coverage is practically independent of the model .",
    "the box counting dimensions are found to be typically lower than the dla dimension @xmath114 and increase as the deposition rate decreases . a significant difference between the models",
    "is reflected in the coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "it is shown ( table [ tab : a_b ] ) that as @xmath6 increases and islands become more compact , @xmath25 decreases by almost a factor of two .",
    "it also decreases when deposition rate is increased ( which also results in more compact islands ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath25 can be understood from the fact that as islands become more compact each occupied box tends to include more atoms ( and still it is counted only once ) . since the coverage",
    "is maintained the number of occupied boxes must decrease .",
    "unlike the box counting analysis which is done on the entire system , the mass dimension analysis is done on each island separately . in this analysis",
    "one finds the center of mass of the island and measures the total mass of the atoms @xmath115 bounded by a circle of radius @xmath59 around it as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "the mass dimension @xmath26 is then obtained from ( fig .",
    "[ massd ] ) @xmath116 where the average is over a large number of islands .",
    "the values of the mass dimension @xmath26 obtained for the three models are summarized in table [ tab : d_m ] and the prefactors @xmath27 in table [ tab : a_m ] .",
    "the mass dimension is found to be in the range between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , significantly larger than the dla dimension .",
    "this larger dimension reflects the enhanced compactness of the islands , however its dependence on the model is rather weak .",
    "the morphological differences are strongly reflected in the coefficient @xmath27 which increases as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "this trend of @xmath27 results from the fact that as the islands become more compact the mass included in a circle of radius @xmath59 around their center must increase .",
    "we conclude that the scaling properties reflected in @xmath24 and @xmath26 are weakly dependent on the models , while the prefactors @xmath25 and @xmath27 are strongly model dependent . in all the three models we considered ,",
    "edge mobility is limited and allows only local rearrangements of the structure .",
    "the prefactors ( which are related to the curve intercept , _",
    "i.e. _ , to small scales ) are sensitive to such changes .",
    "in contrast , the fractal dimensions which are determined over a range of scales are rather insensitive to the small scale behavior .    note that in model i the diffusion is similar to the dla model .",
    "however , unlike dla atoms are added at a finite rate nucleating a finite density of islands . also , these atoms are deposited randomly from above rather than from boundaries located far away from the cluster as in dla .",
    "therefore , some of the atoms fall between ( or on top of ) the arms of the island . for these atoms",
    "the aggregation process is not diffusion limited .",
    "the dla limit can be approached only when both @xmath94 and @xmath119 .",
    "the first limit is required in order to keep islands far away from each other .",
    "the second limit is required in order to ensure that the islands are very small compared to the area from which they draw atoms .",
    "the fractal analysis can provide useful information about processes and rates in island growth systems .",
    "it is accessible experimentally and can be done using either stm data @xcite or helium beam scattering @xcite . in the latter case , one possibility is to obtain the fractal dimension of contours of constant electron density of the monolayer from measurements of the specular peak intensity as a function of helium incidence energy .",
    "note that the models studied here , and in particular models ii and iii , are minimal in the sense that they include the minimal number of allowed moves for the given @xmath6 .",
    "one can add some more moves to each of these models without changing @xmath6 .",
    "for example , moves @xmath120 6 ( 96 ) , 36 ( 66 ) and 70 ( 100 ) can be added to model ii .",
    "these moves are obtained by taking the moves shown in fig .",
    "[ moves ] ( b ) and placing atoms in site @xmath121 or @xmath122 or both ( see fig .",
    "[ local ] ) .",
    "the moves appear in pairs due to the horizontal mirror symmetry such that the move in parenthesis is the mirror image of the one which precedes it .",
    "similarly , moves @xmath120 7 ( 112 ) , 52 ( 67 ) , 70 ( 100 ) and 71 ( 116 ) can be added to model iii .",
    "these additional moves have no significant effect on the scaling properties ( since @xmath6 remains unchanged ) but they enhance edge mobility making the islands more compact .",
    "in particular , move 7 ( 112 ) allows atom mobility along straight island edges which is not possible otherwise .",
    "however , we find that highly compact islands of nearly square shape observed on fcc(001 ) metal substrates such as cu(001 ) and ni(001 ) can not be obtained with models which include only one hopping rate such as the models studied here .",
    "such highly compact islands are obtained only when the hopping rate for moves along island edges such as 7 ( 112 ) are much larger than other hopping rates in the system , including the hopping rate of the monomer @xcite .",
    "in contrast , systems in which atoms can detach from island edges and reattach elsewhere exhibit rather compact island shapes even when the detachment rate is considerably smaller than the hopping rate of the monomer @xcite .    in the models studied here diffusion occurs via the motion of one atom at a time . other diffusion mechanisms , which involve concerted motion of two atoms have also been observed .",
    "in particular , the exchange move in which a substrate atom is displaced by an adatom and pops out into a nnn site of the original adatom position . on surfaces such as al(001 )",
    "@xcite and pt(001 ) @xcite it was found that the energy barrier for exchange is lower than for hopping indicating that this is the dominant diffusion mechanism on these surfaces . in a different type of concerted move",
    ", two atoms move together along the edge of an island .",
    "when the barrier for such move is lower than moves involving single atoms in the island they may drive island diffusion @xcite .",
    "recent stm experiments indicate that for ag(001 ) even large islands may diffuse as a result of the high edge mobility in these systems @xcite .",
    "models related to those studied in this paper appear in the cluster - cluster aggregation problem , where dla - like clusters aggregate at a finite density @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have recently studied a model of island growth in which edge mobility is suppressed while islands of all sizes can move rigidly ( and thus @xmath123 ) while their diffusion coefficients decay according to @xmath124 . in this model",
    "the simple relation between edge mobility and island mobility , which exists in the models of local interactions studied here is broken . due to the lack of edge mobility islands",
    "maintain their dla - like shape while the exponent @xmath5 which depends on @xmath125 is varied .",
    "in summary , we have performed a systematic study of the effect of mobility of small islands on the scaling and morphology in island growth on surfaces .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 , which describes the dependence of island density on deposition rate was examined , for experimentally relevant deposition rates , using both numerical integration of the rate equations and mc simulations .",
    "it was found that @xmath5 increases as the critical island size @xmath6 is increased .",
    "this reflects the decrease in island density which results from the possibility of small islands to move and merge .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath5 in the limit of slow deposition rate is given by @xmath126 .",
    "however , convergence to this asymptotic value by decreasing the deposition rate turns out to be slow for mc simulations and even for rate equations .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 exhibits rather slow dependence on @xmath6 as it increases and is limited to the range @xmath127 .",
    "this indicates that using this scaling law to extract microscopic information on mobility of small islands from experimental results , is hard and requires very precise measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "the island morphology was found to become more compact as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "this reflects a general relation between edge mobility and small island mobility in models of short range interactions . to quantify the morphological changes we have performed a fractal analysis of the island morphology using the box counting and mass dimensions . in both cases",
    "it was found that the fractal dimension is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath6 , however the morphological change is reflected in the value of the prefactors .",
