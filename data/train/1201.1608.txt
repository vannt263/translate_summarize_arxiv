    "the problem of describing the gravitational field of astrophysical compact objects is very important in general relativity . indeed ,",
    "one of the most interesting applications of einstein s general relativity consists in describing the exterior and interior gravitational field generated by a specific mass distribution .",
    "accordingly , it must be possible to find exact solutions of einstein s field equations which correctly describe the influence of gravity inside and outside the mass distribution .",
    "this problem is solved in newtonian gravity by finding the explicit form of the gravitational potential as a solution of the poisson and the laplace equations , respectively . to this end",
    ", it is usually assumed that the mass distribution satisfies certain symmetry conditions that are derived from observations . in particular",
    ", one can assume that the mass distribution does not depend on time and on the azimuthal angle , i.e. it is stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "in this case , the expression of the gravitational potential can be written as an infinite series each term of which represents a particular multipole moment .",
    "an additional important aspect is that all known astrophysical compact objects rotate with respect to observers situated at infinity where the gravitational field is negligible . in newtonian gravity , however , it is well - known that there is no difference between the gravitational potentials of a static and of a rotating ( stationary ) mass distribution .",
    "the question arises whether in einstein s theory of gravity one can find exact solutions that take into account the rotation and axial symmetry of the mass distribution .",
    "it is therefore of importance and interest to describe the relativistic gravitational fields of astrophysical compact objects in terms of their multipole moments , in close analogy with the newtonian theory , taking into account their rotation and their internal structure .    in general relativity",
    ", the gravitational field of compact objects must be described by a metric @xmath0 satisfying einstein s equations , r _ - g_r = 8",
    "t _  , in the interior part of the object ( @xmath1 ) as well as outside in empty space @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 represents the energy - momentum tensor of the source of gravity .",
    "since at the classical level the most important sources of gravity are the mass distribution and the electromagnetic distribution , it is clear that the problem of finding a metric that describes the gravitational field of compact objects can be divided into four related problems .",
    "the first one consists in finding an exact vacuum solution @xmath4 ) that describes the field outside the mass distribution .",
    "secondly , the electromagnetic distribution must be considered by solving the electrovacuum field equations r_= 8 ( f_f^  _ - g _ f _ f^ )  , where @xmath5 is the faraday tensor corresponding to a charge distribution @xmath6 . as for the interior region , it is necessary to propose a model to describe the internal gravitational structure of the object .",
    "the most popular model is that of a perfect fluid t _",
    "= ( + p ) u_u_- g _",
    "p  , [ pf ] with density @xmath7 , pressure @xmath8 , and 4-velocity @xmath9 . finally , the fourth part of the problem consists in considering the mass and charge distribution simultaneously , i.e. one needs an exact solution to the equations r _ - g_r = 8 t _ ( , p , q )  , where a specific model must be proposed for the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "each of the above problems is very difficult to solve because einstein s field equations are highly non - linear .",
    "soon after the formulation of einstein s theory of gravity , the first exterior solution with only a monopole moment was discovered by schwarzschild @xcite . in 1917",
    ", weyl @xcite showed that the problem of finding static axisymmetric vacuum solutions can generically be reduced to a single linear differential equation whose general solution can be represented as an infinite series .",
    "the explicit form of this solution resembles the corresponding solution in newtonian gravity , indicating the possibility of describing the relativistic gravitational field by means of multipole moments . in 1918 ,",
    "lense and thirring @xcite discovered an approximate exterior solution which , apart from the mass monopole , contains an additional parameter that can be interpreted as representing the angular momentum of the massive body . from this solution",
    "it became clear that in einstein s relativistic theory rotation generates a gravitational field that leads to the dragging of inertial frames ( lense - thirring effect ) .",
    "this is the so  called gravitomagnetic field which is of especial importance in the case of rapidly rotating compact objects . the case of a static axisymmetric solution with monopole and quadrupole moment",
    "was analyzed in 1959 by erez and rosen @xcite by using spheroidal coordinates which are specially adapted to describe the gravitational field of non - spherically symmetric bodies .",
    "the exact exterior solution which considers arbitrary values for the angular momentum was found by kerr @xcite only in 1963 .",
    "the problem of finding exact solutions changed dramatically after ernst @xcite discovered in 1968 a new representation of the field equations for stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions .",
    "in fact , this new representation was the starting point to investigate the lie symmetries of the field equations . today",
    ", it is known that for this special case the field equations are completely integrable and solutions can be obtained by using the modern solution generating techniques @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will analyze a particular class of solutions , derived by quevedo and mashhoon @xcite in 1991 , which in the most general case contains infinite sets of gravitational and electromagnetic multipole moments .",
    "as for the interior gravitational field of compact objects , the situation is more complicated",
    ". there exists in the literature a reasonable number of interior spherically symmetric solutions @xcite which can be matched with the exterior schwarzschild metric .",
    "nevertheless , a major problem of classical general relativity consists in finding a physically reasonable interior solution for the exterior kerr metric .",
    "although it is possible to match numerically the kerr solution with the interior field of an infinitely tiny rotating disk of dust @xcite , such a hypothetical system does not seem to be of relevance to describe astrophysical compact objects .",
    "it is now widely believed that the kerr solution is not appropriate to describe the exterior field of rapidly rotating compact objects .",
    "indeed , the kerr metric takes into account the total mass and the angular momentum of the body .",
    "however , the moment of inertia is an additional characteristic of any realistic body which should be considered in order to correctly describe the gravitational field . as a consequence , the multipole moments of the field created by a rapidly rotating compact object are different from the multipole moments of the kerr metric @xcite .",
    "for this reason a solution with arbitrary sets of multipole moments , such as the one presented in this work , can be used to describe the exterior field of arbitrarily rotating mass distributions .",
    "although there exist in the literature many suitable coordinate systems , stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields are usually described in cylindric coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "stationarity implies that @xmath11 can be chosen as the time coordinate and the metric does not depend on time , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , the corresponding timelike killing vector has the components @xmath13 .",
    "a second killing vector field is associated to the axial symmetry with respect to the axis @xmath14 .",
    "then , choosing @xmath15 as the azimuthal angle , the metric satisfies the conditions @xmath16 , and the components of the corresponding spacelike killing vector are @xmath17 .    using further the properties of stationarity and axial symmetry , together with the vacuum field equations , for a general metric of the form @xmath18 , it is possible to show that the most general line element for this type of gravitational fields can be written in the weyl - lewis - papapetrou form as @xcite ds^2 = f(dt - d)^2 - f^-1  , [ lel ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , only .",
    "after some rearrangements which include the introduction of a new function @xmath24 by means of _ = f^2 _ z  , _ z= - f^2 _  , [ bigomega ] the vacuum field equations @xmath25 can be shown to be equivalent to the following set of partial differential equations _ ( _ f ) +",

    "[ kz ] it is clear that the field equations for @xmath21 can be integrated by quadratures , once @xmath19 and @xmath26 are known .",
    "for this reason , the equations ( [ main1 ] ) and ( [ main2 ] ) for @xmath19 and @xmath26 are usually considered as the main field equations for stationary axisymmetric vacuum gravitational fields .    it is interesting to mention that the main field equations can be obtained from a lagrangian in the following way . the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath27 for the line element ( [ lel ] ) with the auxiliary function @xmath26 , as defined in eq.([bigomega ] ) , can be written as _",

    ".      an alternative differential geometric interpretation of stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields can be explored by using the concepts of harmonic maps @xcite as follows .",
    "consider two ( pseudo-)riemannian manifolds @xmath28 and @xmath29 of dimension @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be coordinates on @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "this coordinatization implies that in general the metrics @xmath36 and @xmath37 become functions of the corresponding coordinates .",
    "let us assume that not only @xmath36 but also @xmath37 can explicitly depend on the coordinates @xmath32 , i.e. let @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "the christoffel symbols , determined by the metric @xmath42 , are calculated in the standard manner , without considering the explicit dependence on @xmath43 .",
    "notice that the presence of the term @xmath44 in the lagrangian density takes into account the `` interaction '' between the base space @xmath34 and the target space @xmath35 .",
    "this interaction leads to an extra term in the motion equations , as can be seen in ( [ gengeo ] ) , which is important in order to recover the correct field equations in the case of gravitational fields .",
    "moreover , this interaction affects the conservation laws of the physical systems we attempt to describe by means of generalized harmonic maps . to see this",
    "explicitly we calculate the covariant derivative of the generalized lagrangian density = ^ab(x ) _ a x^ _ b x^g_(x , x )  , [ genlag0 ] and replace the result in the corresponding motion equations ( [ gengeo ] ) .",

    "[ emt ] the standard conservation law @xmath46 is recovered only when the lagrangian does not depend explicitly on the coordinates of the base space .",
    "even if we choose a flat base space @xmath47 , the explicit dependence of the metric of the target space @xmath44 on @xmath43 generates a term that violates the standard conservation law .",
    "this term is due to the interaction between the base space and the target space which , consequently , is one of the main characteristics of the generalized harmonic maps .    consider a @xmath48generalized harmonic map .",

    "we choose a flat metric and in the target space a conformally flat metric , i.e. @xmath51 a straightforward computation shows that the generalized lagrangian ( [ genlag0 ] ) coincides with the lagrangian ( [ lsig ] ) for stationary axisymetric fields , and that the equations of motion ( [ gengeo ] ) generate the main field equations ( [ main1 ] ) and ( [ main2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , if we calculate the components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53,\\ ] ] @xmath54 this tensor is traceless due to the fact that the base space is 2-dimensional .",
    "it satisfies the generalized conservation law ( [ claw2 ] ) on - shell : + + = 0  , [ claw3 ] - = 0  .",
    "[ claw4 ] incidentally , the last equation coincides with the integrability condition for the metric function @xmath21 , which is identically satisfied by virtue of the main field equations .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from eqs.([krho],[kz ] ) and ( [ emtaxi2],[emtaxi3 ] ) , the components of the energy - momentum tensor satisfy the relationships @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so that the conservation law ( [ claw4 ] ) becomes an identity .",
    "although we have eliminated from the starting lagrangian ( [ lsig ] ) the variable @xmath21 by applying a legendre transformation on the einstein - hilbert lagrangian ( see @xcite for details ) for this type of gravitational fields , the formalism of generalized harmonic maps seems to retain the information about @xmath21 at the level of the generalized conservation law .",
    "the above results show that stationary axisymmetric spacetimes can be represented as a @xmath57generalized harmonic map with metrics given as in ( [ explmet ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to interpret the generalized harmonic map given above as a generalized string model .",
    "although the metric of the base space @xmath34 is euclidean , we can apply a wick rotation @xmath58 to obtain a minkowski - like structure on @xmath34 .",
    "then , @xmath34 represents the world - sheet of a bosonic string in which @xmath59 is measures the time and @xmath23 is the parameter along the string .",
    "the string is `` embedded '' in the target space @xmath35 whose metric is conformally flat and explicitly depends on the time parameter @xmath59 . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "let us consider the special case of static axisymmetric fields .",
    "this corresponds to metrics which , apart from being axially symmetric and independent of the time coordinate , are invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath60 ( i.e. rotations with respect to the axis of symmetry are not allowed ) .",
    "consequently , the corresponding line element is given by ds^2 = f dt^2 - f^-1  , [ lel1 ] and the field equations can be written as _ ^2 + _ + _ z^2 = 0  , f=(2 )  , [ eqpsi ] _ k =  , _ z k = 2 _  _ z  .",
    "[ eqkstatic ] we see that the main field equation ( [ eqpsi ] ) corresponds to the linear laplace equation for the metric function @xmath61 .",

    "the expression for the metric function @xmath36 can be calculated by quadratures by using the set of first order differential equations ( [ eqkstatic ] )",
    ". then = - _ n , m=0^ ( p_np_m - p_n+1p_m+1 )  .",
    "since this is the most general static , axisymmetric , asymptotically flat vacuum solution , it must contain all known solutions of this class .",
    "in particular , one of the most interesting special solutions which is schwarzschild s spherically symmetric black hole spacetime must be contained in this class . to see this , we must choose the constants @xmath62 in such a way that the infinite sum ( [ weylsol ] ) converges to the schwarzschild solution in cylindric coordinates .",
    "but , of course , this representation is not the most appropriate to analyze the interesting physical properties of schwarzschild s metric .",
    "in fact , it turns out that to investigate the properties of solutions with multipole moments it is more convenient to use prolate spheroidal coordinates @xmath65 in which the line element can be written as ds^2 = f dt^2 - [ lelxy ] where x=  , ( x^21),y =  , ( y^2 1 ) r_^2 = ^2 + ( z)^2  , = const  , and the metric functions @xmath19 , and @xmath21 depend on @xmath43 and @xmath66 , only . in this coordinate system ,",

    "the most important special cases contained in this general solution are the schwarzschild metric [ schxy ] = - q_0 p_0(y)q_0(x)=  , k =  . indeed , the coordinate transformation y =  , x = [ trart ] transforms the line element ( [ lelxy ] ) into ds^2 = & f dt^2 -  , [ lelrt ] and the metric functions ( [ schxy ] ) with @xmath69 into = ( 1- )  , k = ( )  , which , when inserted in the above line element with @xmath70 , lead to the standard schwarzschild solution in spherical coordinates ds^2= ( 1-)dt^2 - - r^2(d^2+^2d^2 )  . moreover , the erez - rosen metric @xcite is obtained in the special case & = & - p_0(y)q_0(x ) - q_2 p_2(y)q_2(x ) + & = & ( ) + q_2 ( 3y^2 - 1 ) and k = & & ( 1+q_2)^2 ( ) - q_2(1-y^2 ) + & + & q_2 ^ 2(1-y^2 )  . in the last case , the constant parameter @xmath71 turns out to determine the quadrupole moment . in general , the constants @xmath72 represent an infinite set of parameters that determines an infinite set of mass multipole moments .",
    "in fact , using the geroch  hansen @xcite definition , one can prove that the relativistic multipole moments can be expressed as m_n = n_n + r_n  , n_n = ( -1)^n q_n ^n+1  , n=0,1,2 , ... , where @xmath73 are the newtonian multipole moments which have been calculated by using the coordinate invariant method proposed by ehlers in @xcite .",

    "the metric function given in eq.([gensolxy ] ) , together with the corresponding function @xmath21 derived in @xcite , represents the most general static axisymmetric solution of vacuum einstein s equations in prolate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "its multipolar structure represented by the infinite set of parameters @xmath72 can be used to describe the exterior gravitational field of any static mass distribution that preserves the axial symmetry .",
    "the simplest metric contained in this class of solutions corresponds to the schwarzschild spacetime which describes the exterior gravitational field of a black hole of mass @xmath30 . according to the black hole uniqueness theorems",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime represents the only static black hole , i. e. , it is the only solution with a singularity covered by an event horizon .",
    "it then follows that all the multipolar solutions with multipoles higher than the monopole one must be characterized by the presence of naked singularities .",
    "this has been shown explicitly for the erez - rosen solution in @xcite by using a numerical approach due to the complexity of the resulting curvature invariants . to be able to perform an analytical investigation it is necessary to consider a simpler metric . to this end , we use the following property of the field equations for static fields . if @xmath76 and @xmath77 represent an exact static solution of the field equations ( [ eqpsi ] ) and ( [ eqkstatic ] ) , then the functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 const are also solutions to the same field equations .",
    "this property was first discovered by zipoy @xcite and voorhees @xcite .",
    "consider then the solution =  , k =  , which represents the simplest generalization of the schwarzschild metric ( [ schxy ] ) with @xmath69 .",
    "then , introducing spherical coordinates by means of the relations ( [ trart ] ) , and choosing the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath81 , the resulting solution can be written as ds^2 = & & ( 1-)^1-q dt^2 + & - & ( 1-)^q . [ zv ]    this solution is axially symmetric and reduces to the spherically symmetric schwarzschild metric in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "it is asymptotically flat for any finite values of the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath83 . to find the physical meaning of these parameters , we calculate the multipole moments of the solution by using the invariant definition proposed by geroch @xcite .",
    "the lowest mass multipole moments @xmath84 , @xmath85 are given by m_0= ( 1-q)m  , m_2 = q(1-q)(2-q )  , whereas higher moments are proportional to @xmath86 and can be completely rewritten in terms of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this means that the arbitrary parameters @xmath30 and @xmath83 determine the mass and quadrupole which are the only independent multipole moments of the solution . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath89 only the monopole @xmath90 survives , as in the schwarzschild spacetime . in the limit @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , all moments vanish identically , implying that no mass distribution is present and the spacetime must be flat . this can be seen also at the level of the curvature which vanishes in the limiting case @xmath93 .",
    "this means that , independently of the value of @xmath83 , there exists a coordinate transformation that transforms the resulting metric into the minkowski solution . from a physical point of view",
    "this is an important property because it means that the parameter @xmath83 is related to a genuine mass distribution , i.e. , there is no quadrupole moment without mass .",
    "furthermore , notice that all odd multipole moments are zero because the solution possesses an additional reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane .",

    "this is a physical reasonable result in the sense that the magnetic field is generated by the motion of the charge distribution , i. e. , in the present case , by the rotation of the compact object .",
    "it is worth noticing that in all the above special solutions we assumed that @xmath145 and obtained generalizations of the kerr metric with arbitrary quadrupole moment .",

    "the analysis of the general stationary solution turns out to be very complicated because of its mathematical complexity .",
    "the special case of the kerr metric with only an additional quadrupole parameter @xmath71 was recently analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the presence of the quadrupole parameter completely changes the structure of spacetime due especially to the fact that a naked singularity appears that affects the geometric structure of the ergosphere and the motion of test particles around the mass distribution .",

    "a major problem in general relativity is to find physically meaningful solutions that can be matched with exterior exact solutions . in the context of multipolar solutions",
    ", one can say that only a few interior schwarzschild solutions are known which can be considered as physically reasonable .",
    "the search for an interior solution that could be matched with the kerr metric is still an open problem .",
    "only recently it was proposed to use the quadrupole moment as a parameter that introduces an additional degree of freedom into the differential equations which determine the internal structure of the mass distribution @xcite . to illustrate the method we consider the simplest generalization of the schwarzschild spacetime with quadrupole moment given in eq.([zv ] ) . in the search for the corresponding interior solution , we found that an appropriate form of the line element can be written as ds^2 = fdt^2 - ( + d^2 ) -d^2  , where e^2k_0 = ( r^2 - 2mr+m^2 ^ 2)e^2 k ( r , )  , and @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "this line element preserves axial symmetry and staticity . in general , in order to solve einstein s equations with a perfect fluid source , the pressure and the energy must be functions of the coordinates @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",

    "moreover , the function @xmath21 turns out to be determined by a set of two partial differential equations which can be integrated by quadratures once @xmath19 and @xmath156 are known .",
    "the integrability condition of these partial differential equations turns out to be satisfied identically by virtue of the remaining field equations .",
    "it is then possible to perform a numerical integration by imposing appropriate initial conditions . in particular , we demand that the metric functions and the pressure are finite at the axis .",
    "it turns out to be possible to find numerical solutions for the metric functions and the thermodynamic variables .",
    "in particular , the pressure behaves as shown in fig.[fig4 ] .     ]",
    "it can be seen that the pressure is finite in the entire interior domain , and tends to zero at certain hypersurface @xmath157 which depends on the initial value of the pressure on the axis .",
    "incidentally , it turns out that by increasing the value of the pressure on the axis , the `` radius function '' @xmath157 can be reduced .",
    "furthermore , if we demand that the hypersurface @xmath157 coincides with the origin of coordinates , the value of the pressure at that point diverges . from a physical point of view",
    ", this is exactly the behavior that is expected from a physically meaningful pressure function .",
    "this solution can be used to calculate numerically the corresponding riemann tensor and its eigenvalues . as a result",
    "we obtain that the solution is free of singularities in the entire region contained within the radius function @xmath157 . to perform the matching with the exterior metric ( [ zv ] ) we applied the method formulated in @xcite which uses the invariant properties of the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor .",
    "we presented in this work a class of electrovacuum solutions of einstein - maxwell equations which can be used to describe the exterior gravitational field of a rotating distribution of mass endowed with an electromagnetic field .",
    "this class of solutions is characterized by different sets of arbitrary parameters which determine the multipolar structure of the gravitational source .",
    "an important consequence of the presence of multipoles higher than the monopole is that the structure of the spacetime completely changes due to the appearance of naked singularities . in all the cases we investigated ,",
    "the curvature singularities are situated inside the horizon which becomes the outermost naked singularity .",
    "this means that in principle it should be possible to find an interior solution that covers the entire spatial region where the naked singularities exist .",
    "in particular , we found numerically an inner solution that can be matched with an exact exterior metric with a particular quadrupole moment .",
    "the entire spacetime is shown to be free of singularities so that the entire manifold is well - defined in terms of solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "however , the problem of finding interior solutions taking into account the rotation of the gravitational source remains an open problem .",
    "we believe that the multipolar structure of the solutions presented here could be used as additional degrees of freedom to search for more realistic inner solutions .",
