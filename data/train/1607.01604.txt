    "application of the fractional calculus to quantum processes is a new and fast developing part of quantum physics , which studies nonlocal quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "it aims to explore nonlocal effects found for either long - range interactions or time - dependent processes with many scales @xcite .",
    "as it is shown in the seminal papers @xcite , the fractional concept can be introduced in quantum physics by means of the feynman propagator for non - relativistic quantum mechanics in complete analogy with the brownian path integrals @xcite .",
    "the path integral approach for lvy stable processes , leading to the fractional diffusion equation , can be extended to a quantum feynman - lvy measure , which leads to natural appearance of the space fractional schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "a way of introduction of a fractional time derivative in quantum mechanics is not so `` easy '' .",
    "it is tempting to introduce it in the quantum mechanics by analogy with the fractional fokker - planck equation ( ffpe ) by means of the wick rotation of time @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however this way is completely vague from its physical interpretation .",
    "first , it violates stone s theorem on the one - parameter unitary group , there is a group property @xmath1 . ]",
    "another important discrepancy between the fokker - planck and the schrdinger equations is that the latter is the fundamental quantum - mechanical postulate , while the former is just an asymptotic limit of a kinetic equation for the markovian random process .",
    "it is worth noting that , contrary to the space fractional derivative , the fractional time schrdinger equation ( fse ) describes non - markovian evolution with a memory effect . for",
    "the markovian processes the link between the schrdinger equation and the fokker - planck equation is established by the path integral presentation @xcite .",
    "contrary to this for the non - markovian processes this path integral relation is broken due to violation of the stone theorem , therefore the relation between fse and ffpe is broken as well .    however , these arguments do not discard a mathematical attractivity of the fse .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the fse is an effective way to describe the dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the environment . in this case ,",
    "fractional time derivative is an effect of the interaction of the quantum system with the environment , where part of the quantum information is lost @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the paper we consider a physical example of a fractional ( both in space and time ) schrdinger equation , which appears only as a formal effective description of diffusive wave transport in complex inhomogeneous media .",
    "we show that considering ffpe in the parabolic equation approximation , which corresponds to the paraxial small angle approximation , one can obtain the fse as an effective way to solve fractional eigenvalue problem in slab geometry , where the paraxial small angle approximation is naturally applied .",
    "the method of parabolic equation approximation was first applied by leontovich in study of radio - waves spreading @xcite and later developed in detail by khokhlov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in modern experimental and theoretical research",
    ", it naturally appears in investigations of a wave propagation in random optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the ffpe is one of the most general asymptotic description of a wave - diffusion transport in inhomogeneous media @xcite .",
    "for example , fractional calculus description has been introduced to describe the wave propagation at anomalous diffusive oscillations in the lorentz ( cauchy ) pair plasma with dust impurities @xcite , random walk of optic rays in lvy lens @xcite , fractional wave - diffusion in heterogeneous media @xcite as well as seismic waves @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief introduction to fractional calculus and mittag - leffler functions .",
    "ffpe in a slab geometry is considered in section 3 . by using paraxial approximation",
    "we derive the corresponding fse as the parabolic equation approximation for the considered process . in section 4 ,",
    "the obtained model is considered as a kind of a generalisation of the fractional quantum mechanics .",
    "summary is given in section 5 .",
    "fractional derivation was developed as a generalization of integer order derivatives and is defined as the inverse operation to the fractional integral .",
    "fractional integration of the order of @xmath2 is defined by the operator ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the gamma function .",
    "therefore , the fractional derivative is defined as the inverse operator to @xmath6 , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "its explicit form is @xmath9 for arbitrary @xmath10 this integral diverges , and as a result of this a regularization procedure is introduced with two alternative definitions of @xmath11 . for an integer @xmath12 defined as @xmath13 ,",
