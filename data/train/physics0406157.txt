    "biomagnetometry is a rapidly growing field of noninvasive medical diagnostics @xcite . in particular , the magnetic fields generated by the human heart and brain carry valuable information about the underlying electrophysiological processes @xcite . since the 1970s superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) have been used to detect these generally very weak biomagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field of the human heart is the strongest biomagnetic signal , with a peak amplitude of 100  @xmath1 , but since this is still orders of magnitude weaker than typical stray field interference the measurement of such signals could initially only be performed inside expensive magnetically - shielded rooms ( msr ) .",
    "progress in medical research in the past decade has motivated a need for more affordable cardiomagnetic sensors .",
    "recently , multichannel squids were developed that no longer require shielding due to the use of gradiometric configurations .",
    "such devices are commercially available but are still quite expensive in both capital and operational costs .",
    "optical pumping magnetometers ( opm ) have been widely known since the 1960s @xcite , and offer both high sensitivity and reliable operation for research @xcite and applications like geomagnetometry @xcite .",
    "since opms usually work with a near room - temperature thermal alkali metal vapor , they avoid the need for the cryogenic cooling that makes squids so costly and maintenance intensive .",
    "our goal was to develop an affordable , maintenance - free device that is both sensitive and fast enough to measure the magnetic field of the human heart . in order to be competitive with the well - established squids",
    ", a cardiomagnetic sensor has to offer a magnetic field sensitivity of at least 1  @xmath1  with a bandwidth of about 100  @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the spatial resolution of the sensor has to be better than 4  @xmath3 , the standard separation of grid points during mapping .",
    "since the cardiomagnetometry community is mainly interested in one of the components of the magnetic field vector , one might think of using vector - type opms like the hanle magnetometer @xcite or the faraday magnetometer , devices which operate in zero fields only @xcite .",
    "however , these devices lose their sensitivity in the presence of even tiny field components in directions perpendicular to the field of interest .",
    "the broadening caused by such transverse field components must be kept well below the width of the magnetometer resonance @xcite , thus limiting those components to values below a few tenths of  @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , optical vector magnetometers can not be used for cardiomagnetometry in a straightforward way since the heart field features time - varying transverse field components on the order of 100  @xmath1 .",
    "we have therefore concentrated on the @xmath4  opm , which exhibits a fast response and which has been shown to be sufficiently sensitive in an unshielded environment .",
    "furthermore , lamp - pumped @xmath4  opms were used for the first biomagnetic measurements @xcite with optical magnetometers in the early 1980s , although that work was discontinued . instead of lamps , we use diode lasers as a  light source in order to build a device that will scale to the many channels needed for fast mapping of the cardiomagnetic field .",
    "optically pumped magnetometers operate on the principle that the optical properties of a suitable atomic medium are coupled to its magnetic properties via the atomic spin .",

    "for practical reasons it is preferable to shift the phase by 90@xmath54  so that it passes through zero in the center of the resonance ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this can easily be done by shifting the reference signal by @xmath58 using the corresponding feature of the phase detector . in mathematical terms that 90@xmath54",
    "shift is equivalent to the transformation @xmath59 and @xmath60 , yielding @xmath61 the width of the phase signal @xmath62  is smaller than @xmath63because it is not affected by rf power broadening , i.e. , it is independent of @xmath64 : @xmath65 the narrower lineshape of the phase signal is exactly compensated by a better s / n ratio of @xmath48 [ see eqs .",

    "although the theory of optical magnetometry is well known @xcite , predictions about the real performance of a magnetometer , especially when it is operating in weakly shielded environments , are difficult to make .",
    "the performance depends on laser power , rf power , cell size , laser beam profile , buffer - gas pressure , and the temperature - dependent density of cs atoms .",

    "many studies under well - shielded conditions have been carried out in our laboratory , leading to the result that optical magnetometers are in principle sensitive enough to measure the magnetic field of the human heart . however , the shielding cylinders used in these investigations were too small to accommodate a person .",
