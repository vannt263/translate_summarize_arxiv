    "<S> we assume a yukawa - type coupling , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the bare mass of the cdm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this specific choice of coupling requires that the present value of the scalar field vanishes in order to satisfy @xmath7 at present . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ thetac ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling strength @xmath27 is commonly constrained through the comparison with the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropy and matter power spectrum . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we found @xmath28 . even though the actual value of the upper limit depends on the form of the quintessence potential and that of the coupling , the obtained limits for other potentials and couplings are of the same order as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltac ] ) and ( [ thetac ] ) , which describe the evolutions of the cdm density and velocity field respectively , imply that the influence of the quintessence field are dwarfed by the background evolution , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as long as we have the late - time dominated quintessence model , the evolution behaviors of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltac ] ) and ( [ thetac ] ) are quite similar and almost independent of the form of potential . </S>",

    "<S> here we will concentrate on the late quintessence model .    even though we use the full set of the above equations for our calibration </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the effects of coupling on the matter power spectrum with some approximation in what follows . </S>",

[ omegaq2 ] in eq .  ( [ dddeltabx ] ) , we define a baryon bias factor @xmath40 by @xmath41 with a small time variation ( _ i.e. _ we ignore @xmath42 and @xmath43 terms ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we further use the assumption that the linear growth of the cdm is given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 , then we will obtain the analytic form of @xmath40 b = ^-1 . </S>",
    "<S> [ b ]    here we use the ansatz for the coupling between cdm and de as @xmath46 . in our model , the scalar field evolves from @xmath47 to @xmath48 during @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we put a limit on the magnitude of the coupling constant @xmath50 , where the choice of the sign of @xmath27 is still arbitrary . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath52 ( _ equally _ , @xmath53 ) increases ( decreases ) as it evolves to the present for the positive ( negative ) @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in the left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we show the evolution of @xmath40 when @xmath54 . for the positive @xmath27 , the last term in eq .  ( [ b ] ) is negative and its magnitude is bigger than @xmath55 for the given model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of @xmath40 for @xmath57 is depicted in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> the last term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ b ] ) is positive and @xmath40 is always smaller than @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we are able to constrain not only the magnitude but also the form of the coupling between cdm and de from accurate observations of the baryon power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> a similar but slightly different conclusion was drawn in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; however , their conclusion is only true for the tracking region solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we study the cdm density fluctuation @xmath31 given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dddeltacx ] ) for different cases . </S>",
    "<S> we denote respectively the cosmological model including cdm component with the cosmological constant as @xmath59cdm , with the non - coupled q field ( @xmath60 ) as qcdm , and with the coupled q field as cqcdm . </S>",
    "<S> we also denote @xmath61 for each model as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 has the same evolution equations as those of the @xmath59cdm model except the difference in @xmath65 given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ omegaq2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 in the qcdm model changes from @xmath66 in the radiation - dominated epoch ( the so - called `` early tracking region '' ) to around @xmath67 at present . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath68 during the entire epoch . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the suppression of @xmath61 in qcdm model compared to @xmath59cdm model when we use the same present values of the cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this in the left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the diamond and the rectangular points correspond to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> when the cdm is coupled to q field , the scaling of @xmath69 is changed as given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rhoc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath16 is increased during the matter - domination epoch in the cqcdm model as shown in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . the dot - dashed and the dashed lines depict @xmath16 when @xmath70 and @xmath48 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this causes slightly further suppression of @xmath61 in the cqcdm model . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we want to compare @xmath64 with @xmath63 at the relevant sub - horizon scale , then we should constrain their evolutions at late times @xmath71 ( _ equally _ , @xmath72 ) . but then @xmath16s of the two models are almost identical as shown in the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and the discrepancy between @xmath64 and @xmath63 becomes negligible . </S>",
    "<S> if we use the definition of the baryon bias factor @xmath73 , then we would obtain that @xmath74 for the same present values of the cosmological parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the previously mentioned differences in the two - point correlation functions in different models . instead of using the above approximations , we will run the numerical evolution of the full system of equations . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the quintessence to the dark matter modifies both the turnover scale and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , the shift in the turnover scale and the suppression in the amplitude of the matter power spectrum ( defined by @xmath75 ) due to this coupling are too small when we limit the coupling strength to be consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this gives us the motivation to probe the coupling effects on the baryon acoustic peak in the correlation function , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the spherical bessel function . in order to avoid the damping effect of the bao signature in the matter power spectrum due to nonlinear clustering </S>",
    "<S> , we put the limitation of @xmath78 in our correlation function calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we show the correlation function times the comoving separation square ( @xmath79 ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the solid , dashed , and dotted lines correspond to the @xmath59cdm , qcdm , and cqcdm models , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological parameters that we use in this figure are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and the galaxy bias factor @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we also normalize the matter power spectrum to @xmath85 to be consistent with the wmap and the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) observations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the influence of de on the present value of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the fourier transform of a top - hat window function and @xmath88 , is well studied @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we are able to clearly see the differences of the correlation functions for the different models . </S>",
    "<S> the first peak in the correlation function corresponds to the turnover scale which is related to the scale factor @xmath89 when the radiation and the matter densities are equal . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath59cdm and qcdm models have the same @xmath90 for the same set of cosmological parameters while their comoving distances of the matter and radiation equality , @xmath91 , are @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath93 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy comes from the fact that the comoving distance to the @xmath90 is @xmath95 and the two models have slightly different @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> also , the location of @xmath91 in the cqcdm model is different from that in the qcdm model due to the change in the scaling of the cdm density . in our model , @xmath97 and it causes the delay of the radiation and matter equality epoch ( @xmath98 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the comoving distance @xmath91 is shifted to about @xmath99 @xmath93 in the coupled case .    </S>",
    "<S> we have already shown for the relevant @xmath21-modes , @xmath100 for the same present values of the cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we normalize the power spectra of the latter two models on cluster scales @xmath101 , they acquire a larger amplitude of primordial fluctuations compared to the @xmath59cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> the bao bump in the correlation function of both qcdm and cqcdm models are larger than that of the @xmath59cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the reason for the enhancements of the bao bumps in both models are different . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement in the qcdm model compared to the @xmath59cdm one is due to the choice of the larger amplitude of primordial fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement in the cqcdm model is due to the coupling between q and cdm . </S>",
    "<S> we observe this effect in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if we compare the bao peak of cqcdm with that of @xmath59cdm or qcdm , then we observe that it is enhanced in the cqcdm model . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with our early explanation that the baryon bias factor in the cqcdm model is enhanced as given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ b ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall amplitudes of all three models in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] are smaller than those given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the different choices of the galaxy bias factor . </S>",
    "<S> we use the lrg galaxy bias factor @xmath102  @xcite whereas the authors in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite claim that they use the scale dependence bias factor which is however not given therein . </S>",
    "<S> however , both the shapes of the correlation functions and the amplitudes of the bao bumps of the qcdm and cqcdm models fit to the data points better than the @xmath59cdm model . as we mentioned above , if we choose a negative @xmath27 , then the amplitude of the bao bump in the cqcdm model is decreased due to anti - biasing of baryons with @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect mimics the nonlinear effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will suppress the amplitude and shift the location of the bao bump , and thus making harder for us to fit the data . </S>",
    "<S> however , we limit the calculation in the linear regime and this effect is irrelevant for our consideration . in the figure  3 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is claimed that @xmath104 shows the better fit to the data compared to the case using @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the amplitude of the bao bump with @xmath104 shows the bigger discrepancy with the data than that with @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to give a better direction for fitting both the shape and the amplitude of the correlation function in the qcdm and cqcdm models . </S>",
    "<S> we have done a simple @xmath106 analysis and found that the @xmath106 values are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 for the @xmath59cdm , qcdm , and cqcdm models , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> although the improvement has low statistical significance , the species - dependent coupling effects to the correlation function in the coupled quintessence model may be potentially important and are being further studied . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is a slight shift in the location of the bao peak in the qcdm model . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the change in @xmath96 in the qcdm model compared to the @xmath59cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> this affects the sound horizon that is given by @xmath110 , where the sound speed of the baryon - photon fluid @xmath111 is the same for every model . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for each model we have a different @xmath96 and @xmath112 will vary </S>",
    "<S> . however , the difference is quite small . </S>"
