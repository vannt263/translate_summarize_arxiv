    "while spontaneous decay is a fundamental ingredient for many physical processes , many applications have been proposed recently where spontaneous processes are amongst the main limiting factors @xcite .",
    "these schemes usually rely on the persistence of either population trapped in a specific state or of coherences on timescales long as compared to typical atomic timescales such as the lifetime of an atomic state . a well - known example for",
    "this restriction is the construction of a high frequency laser , where it is hard to reach a population inversion as the spontaneous decay is considerable on high frequency transitions . for the storage and the processing of quantum information ,",
    "spontaneous emission is a major limitation , because it is necessary to avoid all possible sources of decoherence in these schemes .",
    "the same holds for the secure information transmission using quantum effects .    because of the great interest in these applications , various schemes to modify the spontaneous dynamics of an atomic system have been proposed @xcite .",
    "one ansatz is the quantum zeno effect @xcite . according to the measurement postulate",
    ", a system is projected into one of its eigenstates upon a measurement . if the measurements are repeated rapidly , the system evolution may effectively be stopped , because each measurement projects the system back into the initial state . the technical conditions on the brevity of the pulses though may not always be easily fulfilled for every transition , especially in the free vacuum .",
    "another possibility is a modification of the vacuum surrounding the given atomic system , e.g. by an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "if the vacuum is modified such that the mode density at the frequency of an atomic transition is decreased , spontaneous processes on the given transition may be suppressed . here",
    "the control of the environmental modes with cavities is rather challenging in reality and not suitable to all schemes .",
    "thirdly it is possible to find superpositions of more than one upper state which are stable @xcite or almost stable @xcite against spontaneous decay .",
    "the suppression of the spontaneous decay here is due to quantum interference effects such as the cancellation of the amplitudes of several possible pathways between two system states @xcite . in spite of the conceptual beauty ,",
    "the disadvantage here often is the difficulty to provide convenient atomic systems which fulfill all conditions such as parallel transition dipole moments for interference to be present .",
    "finally , a system driven by an electromagnetic field periodic in time is somewhat related to systems exhibiting spacial periodicity such as crystals .",
    "thus schemes relying on spacial periodicity which involve a change of the probability for incoherent processes such as the borrmann effect  @xcite or the suppression of nuclear reactions  @xcite may be transferred to laser - driven atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , this idea has also been applied to modify the decay of a three level system in v - configuration  @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a scheme was proposed to slow down the spontaneous decay of the upper state population of an effective atomic two - level system considerably .",
    "this scheme makes use of an intense low - frequency laser field of constant frequency and intensity which is applied to the two - level system such that the frequency of the low - frequency field is lower than the decay width of the atomic transition .",
    "this additional field induces multiphoton transitions between the two atomic states under consideration , thus allowing for alternative pathways between the two states in addition to spontaneous transitions . in the literature ,",
    "hamiltonians describing two - photon processes have been discussed to a great extend @xcite .",
    "however these mainly apply to systems involving dipole - forbidden transitions .",
    "as our aim is to inhibit spontaneous decay , it is not sufficient to look at the spontaneous emission on dipole - forbidden transitions as these rates are very low naturally . for dipole - allowed transitions ,",
    "two- and four - photon pathways vanish due to parity reasons .",
    "therefore it is necessary to extend the analysis to third - order processes  @xcite .",
    "the leading - order corrections are five - photon processes , which we neglect as these have a low probability in the discussed parameter range .    thus in this paper",
    ", we derive the hamiltonian describing the interaction of the two - level system with both the vacuum modes and the additional low - frequency field mode including up to three - photon processes from first principles by adiabatically removing the intermediate atomic states of the multiphoton processes .",
    "we calculate the coupling constants which were taken as free parameters in @xcite in terms of the properties of the atom and the laser field .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian includes stark shift effects not discussed in @xcite , which however will turn out to be of no importance for the suppression scheme .",
    "this hamiltonian is then applied to a quantum mechanical simulation of the decay dynamics of the two - level system . as it will turn out",
    ", the spontaneous decay may be slowed down considerably due to the additional transition pathways induced by the intense low - frequency field . in the final part , this is demonstrated using numerical results of this simulation based on rubidium atoms .",
    "the derivation starts from the usual hamiltonian for an atomic system coupled to quantized electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the atomic system consists of two atomic states ( typically of opposite parity ) which are considered as the ground state @xmath0 and the excited state @xmath1 of an two - level atom , which we will denote as the effective two - level system throughout this paper . to model possible multiphoton transitions between the two effective atomic levels , unspecified auxiliary states @xmath2 ( @xmath3 )",
    "are required , which will be adiabatically eliminated throughout the analysis .     which will be adiabatically removed in the derivation of the multiphoton hamiltonian .",
    "the auxiliary states are show schematically ; their relative position is not restricted to be above the two main atomic states .",
    "after the adiabatic elimination , the effective two - level system exhibits multiphoton processes as symbolized in the figure . here , the short arrows depict interactions with the intense low - frequency field and the long arrows interactions with the vacuum field . ,",
    "height=170 ]    these states might even be part of the continuum ; the only condition on them is that they are sufficiently far away from the two main atomic states as will be explained in more detail below . since there are no isolated two - level atomic systems , the presence of this states is always guaranteed .",
    "the auxiliary states are necessary as in starting from first principles , i.e. the interaction hamiltonian @xmath4 , we only allow for one - photon transitions between the two effective atomic states .",
    "multiphoton processes are then introduced by considering series of one - photon processes from one of the two effective states to the other effective state via one or more of the auxiliary states , which within the adiabatic approximation occur simultaneously .",
    "the result will be a hamiltonian involving the states of the effective two - level system only , which will turn out to be a generalization of the one used in @xcite .",
    "the applied field consists of the low frequency field of frequency @xmath5 and the vacuum field modes .",
    "the following analysis is similar to the one in @xcite , and the notation is close to @xcite .",
    "the system hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath3 ) are the energies of state @xmath9 and auxiliary state @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is a multi index over all polarization modes and vacuum frequencies @xmath11 . throughout the analysis",
    ", we denote sums over all auxiliary states excluding the two effective atomic states @xmath9 by the sum subscript @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the summation index .",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is a low - frequency field annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath16 @xmath17 ) annihilates ( creates ) a vacuum photon of mode @xmath10 , @xmath18 is the total atomic dipole operator , and @xmath19 is the electric field given by @xmath20 the @xmath21 are polarization vectors , while the @xmath22 are field amplitudes .",
    "the frequency corresponding to the low - frequency field operators @xmath23 is assumed to be different from the relevant frequencies for the vacuum photons , which are close to the atomic transition frequency of the effective two - level system , such that the low - frequency field operators commute with the relevant vacuum field operators . in the following analysis , we make use of the approximation that no multiphoton transitions involving two or more spontaneous photons with _",
    "different _ frequencies are included . as in our system",
    "spontaneous one - photon transitions are possible , transitions involving more than one spontaneous photon are highly suppressed ; see the processes considered and observed in @xcite",
    ". however we include multiple spontaneous photons with the _ same _ frequency to account for stark shifts , which arise from interactions of the atom with the electromagnetical field as a sequence of an absorption and an emissions ( or vice versa ) which does not change the state of the atomic system .",
    "also we consider all possible combinations of interactions with the low - frequency field as it is intense .",
    "the interaction part of the hamiltonian may be expanded as follows : @xmath24 @xmath25 is the atomic transition operator , @xmath26 is the dipole moment corresponding to transition @xmath27",
    ". some of these dipole moments may be zero due to symmetry reasons , however as this depends on the configuration of the auxiliary states , we keep this most general form of the hamiltonian .",
    "a specific example for this will be given in section  [ rubidium ] where we discuss rubidium as a model system .",
    "in this expansion , the first part in equation  ( [ order3 ] ) corresponds to direct transitions between the ground and the excited state by dipole coupling to one of the electric field components ( i.e. one - photon transitions ) .",
    "the second addend couples both the ground and the excited state to one of the auxiliary states . after an adiabatic elimination of these intermediate states , this part will turn out to represent multiphoton transitions . obviously",
    "n - photon transitions with @xmath28 require transitions amongst the auxiliary states ; thus these effects are accounted for by the last part in equation  ( [ order3 ] ) .",
    "these last two parts together with the intense low - frequency field lead to a system evolution which qualitatively differs from the well - known mollow - type evolution for two - level systems resonantly driven by a laser field @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that a higher order multiphoton treatment based on the above hamiltonians involves operator ordering issues , as in the following analysis the atomic transition operators involving auxiliary states will be represented by expressions containing photon operators . if these issues are not taken into account , the resulting hamiltonians are not self - adjoint . thus strictly speaking ,",
    "expressions like @xmath29 in the above hamiltonians are understood to be read as @xmath30 as the above equation equation  ( [ order3 ] ) is difficult to solve exactly , we use a perturbative approach which consists of an expansion in the number of interactions with the auxiliary levels .",
    "the lowest order hamiltonian thus does not include any interactions with the auxiliary levels and may therefore be written as @xmath31 this hamiltonian simply describes the coupling of the vacuum- and the low - frequency field to the effective two - level atom and does not contain contributions of the auxiliary states . to account for two - photon processes",
    ", we have to consider transitions from the ground or the excited state into and out of the auxiliary states , but no transitions amongst the auxiliary states .",
    "for this we introduce the transition operators @xmath32 and their conjugates , where the super index @xmath33 denotes the lowest order approximation whose equations of motion do not include any contribution of the auxiliary states . only the operators involving the auxiliary states are approximated , as the operators connecting only the ground and the excited state contain the main evolution of the system and therefore have to be taken into account to all orders .",
    "thus the two - photon hamiltonian is given by @xmath34 as it will be shown in section  [ transops ] , the transition operators @xmath32 and their conjugates consist of sums of products of a transition operator @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and a photon annihilation or creation operator .",
    "thus it may easily be seen that contributions to the hamiltonian in equation  ( [ h2 ] ) containing transition operators to one of the auxiliary states describe two - photon processes . including up to three - photon processes",
    ", a transition from one of the two effective atomic levels to one of the auxiliary levels may be followed by a transition to another auxiliary state . thus the three - photon hamiltonian may be expressed in terms of the first order transition operators @xmath37 and their conjugates , whose equations of motion contain either lowest - order transition operators to the auxiliary state or transitions between the two effective atomic states .",
    "also , transition operators between two auxiliary states are possible in lowest order @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , i.e. with no reference to the auxiliary states in the equations of motion .",
    "this yields @xmath40 as the three - photon hamiltonian . here , the operator ordering was not applied to the term containing a double sum over @xmath41 for notational simplicity as it will turn out to be irrelevant for the present analysis . for higher order processes , @xmath42 with @xmath43",
    "may be obtained similarly . introducing the coupling constants @xmath44 where",
    "the transition dipole moments are assumed to be real , the hamiltonians may be written as @xmath45        the equations of motion for the various operators involved may be obtained using the heisenberg equation @xmath46\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is an operator in the heisenberg picture .",
    "for the transition operator @xmath35 with @xmath48 - which is one of the elements that occurs in the above hamiltonians in equations  ( [ twophot ] , [ threephot ] ) - this may be expanded as follows to the lowest two orders in the interaction with the auxiliary states : @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the zeroth order equation does not include references to the auxiliary states , while the first order includes operators connecting one of the main atomic states with an auxiliary state in zeroth order .",
    "note that for simplicity we omitted an addend containing the transition operator @xmath52 in the first - order equation , as it will turn out to be zero ( see equation ( [ aux - pop ] ) ) .",
    "higher order expressions may be obtained similarly . for @xmath53",
    ", we have : @xmath54 for @xmath55 the corresponding expression in lowest order simply becomes @xmath56      the basic tool to eliminate the auxiliary states from the equation of motion is the adiabatic integration . for this , the equations of motion are written in terms of slowly varying operators which are denoted by the corresponding symbol with a tilde and which may be seen as an interaction picture representation of the operator : @xmath57 the adiabatic approximations with superscripts @xmath58 are transferred as their full counterparts .",
    "the definition of the slowly varying operators is chosen as in @xcite to allow for a comparison of the results .",
    "this for example yields using equations  ( [ field ] ) , ( [ coupling ] ) and ( [ s1j_zero ] ) @xmath59 now we integrate over time , using the partial integration rule . for simplicity ,",
    "only the first addend of equation  ( [ adiab - example ] ) is shown to illustrate the basic idea of adiabatic integration : @xmath60 in the adiabatic integration one now assumes that the time evolution of the slowly changing operators @xmath61 ( which is typically of the order of the atomic decay rate or the rabi frequencies involved ) is low as compared to the oscillation of the exponential function .",
    "this is fulfilled if the rabi frequencies involved are not too large and if the intermediate states @xmath2 ( @xmath12 ) are sufficiently far away from the atomic ground and excited state , which we assume in the following .",
    "therefore the integral on the right hand side of equation ( [ partint ] ) may be dropped , yielding using ( [ trans ] ) and including all addends : @xmath62 as the lowest order adiabatic approximation for this atomic transition operator .",
    "a similar calculation yields @xmath63 from equation  ( [ eom_ij ] ) , we obtain for @xmath55 in the slowly varying operator frame : @xmath64 as the auxiliary states are far from resonance with the applied frequencies , in lowest order of the adiabatic approximation we thus have @xcite @xmath65 for @xmath55 .",
    "another way of seeing this is that due to the vanishing time derivative , in this order of approximation the populations of the auxiliary states remain constant . as these populations are zero if the population initially is distributed over the ground and the excited state , they are empty at all times .",
    "these results are sufficient to calculate the effective two - photon hamiltonian equation  ( [ h2 ] ) and to obtain the first order expressions for the transition operators in equations  ( [ s1j_one ] ) and ( [ s2j_one ] ) . as the expressions in equations  ( [ s1j_one_int ] ) and ( [ s2j_one_int ] ) only contain transition operators involving the ground and the excited state , the elimination of the auxiliary states both from the two - photon hamiltonian and from the first order expressions for the transition operators is obvious .",
    "note however that the dipole moments connecting the ground and the excited atomic state to the auxiliary states remain in the equations influencing the various coefficients or coupling parameters .",
    "to calculate the first order transition operators , we we insert the lowest - order transition operators equations  ( [ s1j_one_int ] ) and ( [ s2j_one_int ] ) and their conjugates in the equations of motion for the first order operators equations  ( [ s1j_one ] ) and ( [ s2j_one ] ) . then the equations are transferred to the slowly changing operator picture using the transformation rules equations  ( [ trans ] ) . the resulting expression for @xmath66 , @xmath67 and their conjugates may again be adiabatically integrated yielding @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "in addition to the corresponding operator of zeroth order , each of these operators contains 56 addends as first order contribution , 28 of which depend on a sum over auxiliary intermediate atomic states @xmath70 .",
    "for example , we have @xmath71 the operators @xmath72 , which are proportional to @xmath35 , and the other first order transition operators may be found in [ anhang - trans - op ] .      in this section",
    ", we will use the transition operators derived in the last section to give an explicit representation of the two - photon and the three - photon hamiltonian in equations  ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ h3 ] ) .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian will turn out to be equivalent to the hamiltonian used in @xcite .",
    "however here we obtain expressions for the coupling constants @xmath73 introduced as free parameters in the hamiltonian in @xcite and extend the analysis to include stark shift contributions to the hamiltonian .",
    "the role of the stark shifts for the decay dynamics of the effective two - level atom will be discussed in section  [ decay ] .      using the rotating - wave approximation , we drop all terms oscillating with frequencies of the order of @xmath11 or higher in the two - photon hamiltonian in equation  ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "thus we neglect counter - rotating interactions with the vacuum field , but do not apply the rotating - wave approximation to the interaction of the atom with the low - frequency field . transferring the resulting expression back to the heisenberg picture adopted in the initial equations equation  ( [ order3 ] ) using the transformation rules in equations  ( [ trans ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath74 where the coefficients are given by @xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath77 and the detunings are defined as @xmath78 here , the terms proportional to @xmath79 are the usual one - photon hamiltonian parts .",
    "the next addends including @xmath80 are two - photon transitions which will turn out to be of most interest for the following analysis .",
    "terms with @xmath81 may be interpreted as stark shifts due to the presence of the two electromagnetic field modes .",
    "this hamiltonian is an extension to the one obtained in  @xcite in that it includes more transitions such as direct one - photon transitions due to the vacuum and also field ordering effects .",
    "these ordering effects are the reason why for example @xmath82 and @xmath83 here are not the same other than in  @xcite .",
    "the addends proportional to @xmath84 are somewhat generalized stark shifts in that they involve the population operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "usually they do not appear in effective multiphoton hamiltonians as they may be dropped in a rotating wave approximation if the frequency of the involved photons is large enough .",
    "for example , the addend with @xmath87 stems from a transition @xmath88 followed by a transition @xmath89 , one of which is counter - rotating .",
    "but here @xmath14 represents a low - frequency photon such that these terms may not be dropped a priori .",
    "however as discussed later the numerical simulations indicate that they do not disturb the effects described in @xcite .",
    "one hint that may help to understand this is that from a quantum mechanical point of view , these contributions account for a distribution of the system state over the various fock states of the low - frequency field without inducing atomic transitions .",
    "the trapping effect however does not rely on a specific configuration of the low - frequency field modes such as a concentration of the states to only few of the fock states .",
    "the interpretation of the general structure of this hamiltonian is straightforward . in each addend of the @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) ,",
    "the number of @xmath92 coefficients is equal to the number of photons exchanged .",
    "the various processes involved may also be read off from the @xmath92 coefficients , as for example in @xmath93 in equation  ( [ alpha1 ] ) , which describes a transition of the effective atom from the ground state @xmath0 to the excited state @xmath1 together with the absorption of both a low - frequency and a spontaneous photon ( @xmath94 in hamiltonian equation  ( [ ham2_ad ] ) ) .",
    "the first addend stems from a transition between @xmath0 and an intermediate state @xmath2 via a vacuum - induced transition ( @xmath95 ) and a low frequency field photon absorption between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the third addend is due to a transition between @xmath0 and an intermediate state @xmath2 via a low frequency field photon absorption ( @xmath97 ) and a vacuum - induced transition between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( @xmath98 ) .      using the results of section  [ higher - order ] in the expression for the three - photon hamiltonian equation  ( [ h3 ] ) yields after a calculation as in section  [ sec - two - photon ] for the two - photon hamiltonian the following three - photon hamiltonian : @xmath99 thus as expected the one- and two - photon processes of this hamiltonian are identical to the ones in the two - photon hamiltonian equation  ( [ ham2_ad ] ) .",
    "all additional terms in equation  ( [ ham3_ad ] ) are three - photon processes .",
    "the terms with @xmath100 are corrections to @xmath79 in the two - photon hamiltonian , as they effectively induce the same transition . @xmath101 and @xmath102 are coefficients to the three - photon transition parts , which will be of most interest in the simulation of the decay dynamics .",
    "third - order stark effects vanish due to symmetry reasons . introducing the detuning @xmath103 ,",
    "the explicit expressions for the @xmath104 coefficients are given as follows ( note that the sums over @xmath13 and @xmath105 have been omitted for notational simplicity ; all occurrences of these indices are summed over all auxiliary states in these coefficients ) : @xmath106     the first four transitions involved in the coupling constant @xmath101 corresponding to the transition @xmath107 .",
    "the solid lines denote interactions with the low - frequency field , the dashed line denotes a vacuum photon emission .",
    "all paths start in state @xmath1 and end in state @xmath0 .",
    "the lengths of the arrows are not related to the frequencies of the involved photons.,height=188 ]    the structure of the coefficients is similar to the one in the two - photon hamiltonian , and the contributing transition pathways may be read off each addend .",
    "figure  [ transition ] shows the first four processes contributing to @xmath101 .",
    "this coefficient corresponds to the transition @xmath107 in the hamiltonian equation  ( [ ham3_ad ] ) .",
    "for example , the first addend in @xmath101 in equation  ( [ beta3 ] ) describes a path starting by a transition from the excited state @xmath1 to the auxiliary state @xmath70 induced by a low - frequency field absorption , followed by a transition to the auxiliary state @xmath2 induced by a low - frequency field absorption , and then a vacuum photon emission with a transition to the ground state @xmath0 .",
    "the other transition pathways may be read off the addends accordingly .",
    "it is important to note that the frequency of the spontaneous photon emitted or absorbed in the multiphoton processes is always close to the atomic transition frequency , because the sum of the frequencies of all photons ( with a relative sign between emitted and absorbed photons ) is required to be close to the atomic transition frequency for a spontaneous emission to occur .",
    "this will be shown using a wigner - weisskopf - like calculation in section  [ decay ] .",
    "for any application of the above hamiltonian equation  ( [ ham3_ad ] ) , it is important to be able to decide which intermediate states need to be taken into account in the analysis .",
    "first of all , the number of exchanged photons restricts the atomic level space .",
    "for example in a three - photon transition from a @xmath108 ( angular momentum @xmath109 ) to a @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) state , states with @xmath112 are not possible as intermediate states .",
    "the two important parameters which decide about the relevance of the remaining intermediate states are the transition dipole moments which connect the state in question to other relevant states , and the frequency separation to the other states .",
    "a reasonable parameter involving these quantities is e.g. the ratio @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , i.e. , the coupling strength of the multiphoton transitions relative to the single photon transition strength . by evaluating the expression for @xmath115 for each combination of the intermediate states @xmath13 and @xmath105 separately , it is possible to compare the relative weights of the various pathways as e.g. shown in figure  [ transition ] .",
    "then the states which give rise to pathways with small relative contribution can be neglected . for this , it is not necessary to evaluate all possible combinations . if @xmath116 is the principal quantum number of an intermediate state which is higher than the principal quantum numbers of the ground and the excited state , then the contribution of the corresponding intermediate state with principal quantum number @xmath117 can be expected to be lower than the contribution of the state with quantum number @xmath116 due to the larger frequency separation and due to a lower transition dipole moment",
    "to further understand the various contributions in the derived hamiltonian , and to analyze the modification of the decay dynamics due to the additional multiphoton transition pathways we apply the three - photon hamiltonian equation  ( [ ham3_ad ] ) in a quantum mechanical simulation of the effective two - level atom subject to an intense low - frequency field and the vacuum modes .",
    "for this , we rearrange the free and the interaction part of the three - photon hamiltonian as follows : @xmath118 @xmath119 is the effective free hamiltonian , including the stark shifts of the two atomic levels .",
    "@xmath120 describes the interaction with the vacuum field , i.e. the spontaneous decay .",
    "the contributions involving operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 in this part account for multiphoton transitions consisting of one interaction with the vacuum field and one or more interactions with the low - frequency field .",
    "@xmath121 contains terms due to the low frequency field alone which drive the effective system .    in order to calculate the system evolution",
    "we notice that @xmath121 contains multiphoton processes only such that its coupling constants @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) are moderate even for an intense low - frequency field .",
    "thus in the regime where the previous approximations such as the adiabatic elimination are valid , the evolution which gives rise to the damping of the system ( i.e. the coupling to the vacuum ) may be evaluated separately from external driving fields as it is common practice in quantum optical calculations , see e.g. chapter 8.6.1 in @xcite .",
    "thus in our case , we evaluate the system with @xmath124 alone and then combine the resulting equations of motion with the ones resulting from the driving part @xmath121 .",
    "this approximation holds if @xmath125 , which means that coupling constants in @xmath121 have to be low as compared to the atomic transition frequency of the effective two - level system .",
    "first , we transfer the vacuum interaction part of the hamiltonian @xmath120 to the interaction picture with respect to the free part @xmath119 . to understand the stark shift contribution , we transfer the partial hamiltonian @xmath126 as an example : @xmath127 with @xmath128 as the stark shift contributions due to spontaneous photons @xmath129 and due to coherent low - frequency photons @xmath130 . the two exponential functions in each of the contributions describe the stark shift of the upper level @xmath1 and of the lower level @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the shifts are proportional to the number of photons in the respective modes .",
    "the difference in the photon number factors for the two states ( e.g. @xmath131 as compared to @xmath132 ) is due to the fact that the example hamiltonian part induces changes in the photon numbers . to evaluate their importance",
    ", these contributions have to be compared to the exponential factor in equation  ( [ example - ham ] ) .",
    "there is at most one photon in the vacuum modes @xmath133 , thus @xmath129 may be safely neglected . for the low - frequency field , it is reasonable to assume a coherent state with a large mean number of photons @xmath134 , as this represents an intense laser field . as the relative photon number distribution width decreases as @xmath135 for coherent states , and as @xmath136 in the vacuum part of the three - photon hamiltonian , we approximate @xmath137 and thus have @xmath138 as the stark shift contribution .",
    "it is important to note that the simulated model system does not loose its quantum character in adopting these approximations , which are less inspired by physical than by numerical reasoning , as we keep the photon operators and the distinguishable fock states for the electromagnetical fields .",
    "the above argument holds for all terms in @xmath120 with the same result , thus these shifts may be taken care of by introducing an effective atomic transition frequency @xmath139 then the vacuum interaction part becomes @xmath140 this expression is equivalent to the interaction hamiltonian in @xcite , while we do not introduce the generalized ladder operators @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) here which were used in the semiclassical approximation in @xcite .",
    "we proceed with the ansatz for the wavefunction @xmath144 here the first index in the kets denotes the atomic state , the second slot represents the number of photons in the low - frequency field , and the last entry is either @xmath145 for the vacuum without photons or @xmath10 for a single photon in mode @xmath10 .",
    "as described earlier , we first derive an equation of motion for the state amplitudes due to the vacuum part of the hamiltonian @xmath146 , which we denote by @xmath147 and @xmath148 . in a second step ,",
    "we calculate the equations corresponding to the driving part of the hamiltonian @xmath149 with amplitudes @xmath150 .",

    "thus it is possible to include states even if there are decay channels leading out of the simulated level space . also , low spontaneous decay rates do not in general mean that the corresponding transitions do not need to be taken into account , as the low rates may be due to the small energy spacing between two states .",

    "for this one should note that other than in most previously studied systems exhibiting quantum interference effects @xcite , in our setup non - zero values for @xmath227 can be found in any atomic system , which is due to the fact that here the two transitions do not need to have a similar transition frequency or a common atomic state . to speed up the numerical calculations , the driving terms in equation  ( [ driving - part ] )",
