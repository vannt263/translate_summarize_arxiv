    "the spreading of liquid droplets is a fascinating and highly consequential phenomenon which has received great attention for over a century @xcite .",
    "when a small volume of liquid is placed on a solid substrate , it can spread to form a hemispherical drop with a free surface and three - phase equilibrium contact angle @xmath0 .",
    "this is referred to as partial wetting . however ,",
    "if the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the substrate the liquid spreads as much as it can , forming a pancake shaped ultrathin drop . this is referred to as complete wetting .",
    "this wetting behaviour influences phenomena that arise in everyday life , such as in the sliding of rain drops on windows or plant leaves , paint coating a wall or tear films in the eye @xcite .",
    "as well as being a simple day to day process , static and dynamic wetting behaviour also influences many industrial processes .",
    "critical applications such as coating , printing and lubrication have motivated many scientists to understand the evolution of thin liquid films and drops on substrates and to develop models for their dynamics @xcite .",
    "all these wetting phenomena are governed by surface and interfacial interactions that occur over length scales varying from the very small ( ) molecular distances to a few nm for van der waals or electrostatic forces to the mesoscopic ( @xmath1 m ) scale for capillary forces .",
    "understanding the interplay of all these interactions and their influence on the interfacial fluid dynamics and thermodynamics is at the core of understanding the behaviour and properties of droplets and thin liquid films on a solid substrate .    here",
    ", we develop a thin - film model in the form of a partial differential equation ( pde ) that describes the time evolution of the local amount of liquid on a substrate .",
    "it includes many aspects of the microscopic interactions between the liquid molecules and the substrate .",
    "note , that from the microscopic ( statistical mechanics ) viewpoint , _ adsorption _ is a better defined and arguably more useful measure of the amount of liquid on the substrate than _ film thickness _",
    "this is because when the amount of liquid on the substrate is small ( sub monolayer ) , then talking about a film height that is a fraction of a molecule does not make physical sense , whilst the adsorption is well - defined .",
    "in fact , when the vapour pressure is non - zero , the adsorption on the substrate can in principle even be negative , so in this case , talking about a film height is meaningless .",
    "consider a fluid confined in a volume @xmath2 , in contact with a planar substrate with area @xmath3 and with density distribution @xmath4 .",
    "the total adsorption on the substrate is calculated from the fluid density profile as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bulk fluid density , which in our context is the vapour density @xmath7 .",
    "if the planar substrate is assumed to correspond to the @xmath8 plane in a cartesian coordinate system , then we can define the local adsorption as @xmath9 \\",

    "the contact angle is @xmath14 .",
    "we identify three distinct regions , areas 1 - 3 , where the adsorption takes three distinct values due to the fact that when the substrate adsorption is low , the influence of molecular packing becomes important .",
    "the dashed line gives the corresponding effective film height . in area 1 , the amount adsorbed on the substrate is low , so the effective film height @xmath15 , the diameter of the molecules . ]",
    "when the cohesive forces between the molecules that form the liquid are short ranged compared to the size of the molecules @xmath16 , then strong layering at the substrate is possible , particularly at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "see also the molecular dynamics simulation results in ref .",
    "consider the contact line region of a drop of such a system , that is close to the wetting transition , with @xmath17 .",
    "a sketch of a configuration of the molecules is displayed in fig .",
    "[ adsorption ] .",
    "three distinct regions , areas 13 can be identified , based on the amount adsorbed .",
    "the thickness of the individual layers is approximately equal to the diameter of the liquid molecules , @xmath16 . in area 1 , there are just a few molecules adsorbed on the substrate , so the film height @xmath15 , as defined via eq .  . in areas 2 and 3 ,",
    "the film height is roughly an integer number of molecular layers , since the strong intermolecular attractions favour complete layers . in refs .",
    "@xcite , density functional theory ( dft ) for a simple model system was used to calculate the density distribution of a liquid at a substrate exhibiting this type of layered structure formation , which is remarkably similar to the terraced spreading drops observed in the experiments reported in @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , using the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite the binding ( or wetting ) potential @xmath18 was also calculated .",
    "this binding potential @xmath18 , together with the interfacial tensions , gives the excess free energy for having a liquid film of thickness @xmath10 adsorbed on the substrate ( see eq .",
    "it was found that in the types of situations sketched in fig .",
    "[ adsorption ] , the binding potential is oscillatory . in this paper",
    "we consider the influence of such an oscillatory binding potential on the shape of steady drops and also on the dynamics of drop spreading .",
    "the established thin film models describe the advective motion of the liquid over the substrate , sometimes also incorporating slip @xcite .",
    "however , normally , such models do not include the diffusive particle - hopping dynamics that one should expect when the adsorption is low @xcite , such as in area  1 in fig .",
    "[ adsorption ] .",
    "thus , we also develop here an augmented thin - film equation that incorporates this effect .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : the relevant physical concepts of interfacial science are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : wett ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] the mathematical description of steady and spreading drops is derived and the solution methodology that is used to solve the model are introduced . an extension to include diffusive effects into the dynamics",

    "when a liquid drop is placed onto a dry solid substrate , it spreads a certain extent , until equilibrium is reached . at equilibrium ,",
    "the total free energy of the system is minimised and the shape of the drop stops varying .",
    "the equilibrium spreading coefficient @xmath19 is often used to characterise the spreading of the drop and distinguish the three different regimes of wetting behaviour .",
    "it measures the difference between the surface energy of the dry and the wet substrate .",
    "@xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the interfacial tensions ( excess free energy per unit area ) of the solid / vapour , solid / liquid , and liquid / vapour interfaces , respectively , and are defined when three phases are in equilibrium with each other .",
    "is distinct from @xmath24 , the interfacial energy of the completely dry interface , which can be used to define a non - equilibrium spreading coefficient . ]",
    "the equilibrium contact angle @xmath0 , is determined by young s equation @xcite @xmath25 for large enough droplets , @xmath0 is the inner angle the liquid - vapour interface makes with the substrate . combining equations ( [ yl ] ) and ( [ y ] ) together we obtain @xmath26 which relates the contact angle @xmath0 to the spreading coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "if the three interfacial tensions are known , the wetting regime of the fluid can be calculated directly . when @xmath27 , which corresponds to @xmath28 , the liquid spreads completely and thus is termed complete wetting .",
    "the system is in equilibrium when a macroscopically uniform thick liquid layer covers the whole solid substrate .",
    "partial wetting occurs when @xmath29 , which implies @xmath30 . in this case ,",
    "small droplets form a spherical cap due to dominant capillary effects .",
    "deviations from a spherical cap shape occur if the radius of the drop is larger than the capillary length @xmath31 , so that gravity can no longer be neglected . unless the vapour pressure of the liquid is zero , at equilibrium the substrate surrounding the drop",
    "is covered by a microscopically thin layer of thickness @xmath32 adsorbed on the substrate .",
    "this adsorbed layer is generally sub - monolayer [ c.f .",
    "[ adsorption ] ] , so the popular terminology ` precursor film ' is potentially misleading . for non - wetting to occur , @xmath33 .",
    "the wetting behaviour is determined by the molecular interactions ( e.g.  van der waals , electrostatic forces , etc . ) .",
    "for very small drops and for length scales below a few hundred nm these interactions become important and can extend across the thickness of the film and contribute extra forces that determine the shape of the drop and how it spreads . for a film of thickness @xmath10",
    ", these interactions result in additional contributions to the free energy @xmath18 , often referred to as the binding potential .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the derjaguin ( or disjoining / conjoining ) pressure @xcite , @xmath34 the interaction between the two interfaces can also be discussed in terms of this pressure .",
    "the total excess free energy per unit area of a system with a film of liquid with uniform thickness @xmath10 is : @xmath35 where @xmath3 is the area covered by the film .",
    "thus , @xmath18 gives the contribution to the free energy from the interactions between two interfaces , and has the limiting values @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the disjoining pressure gives the difference between the pressure @xmath38 in a thin liquid layer with thickness @xmath10 and @xmath39 , the pressure when the liquid film is macroscopically thick .",
    "thus , @xmath40    in general , three main contributions to the disjoining pressure @xmath41 are identified @xcite : ( i ) a long - range van der waals contribution due to the interaction between dipoles ( either permanent or induced ) of the liquid molecules and the substrate molecules .",
    "it can be attractive or repulsive ; ( ii ) long - range electrostatic forces , from charge double layers overlapping during thinning .",
    "the like charged surfaces of the film repel each other ; ( iii ) short - range steric forces , which stem from the repulsive interactions between molecules when they are pushed close together .",
    "the van der waals force is characterised by the hamaker constant @xmath42 @xcite , originating from the attractive ( london ) potential between individual pairs of molecules which at large @xmath43 is @xmath44 , where @xmath43 is the distance between molecules .",
    "it gives the longest range contribution to @xmath41 .",
    "the leading order term that dominates for large @xmath10 is @xmath45 if @xmath46 , it means the two interfaces attract each other and the film thins ; on the other hand if @xmath47 , the two interfaces repel each other .",
    "thus , the van der waals force often determines the wetting behaviour . in the case @xmath48",
    ", one must include additional terms in @xmath41 .",
    "a commonly used expression that describes a partially wetting situation and allows for a stable precursor film is @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a positive constant .",
    "the corresponding binding potential is @xmath52 the positive term represents the short range repulsive forces , while the second term describes the longer range van der waals forces contribution .",
    "this form has been frequently used in thin - film models , e.g. , in refs .",
    "however , as can be deduced from considering the @xmath53 limit , it is clear that this expression is really only valid for large film thickness .",
    "similarly , for model systems with only short range forces one finds that for large @xmath10 the binding potential decays exponentially : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the bulk correlation length in the liquid phase wetting the wall and coefficients @xmath56 depend on the temperature @xcite .",
    "the progress made in refs .",
    "@xcite was to develop a dft based method for calculating @xmath18 , or strictly speaking @xmath57 , that is valid over the whole range of values of @xmath10 .",
    "note that one can also use a molecular dynamics computer simulation based method for calculating @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "for simple lennard - jones like fluids it was shown @xcite that the following form gives a good fit to the binding potential over the whole range : @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",

    ". there is the usual spreading and relaxation from the initial condition , but there is also the formation of terraces and ` popping ' events where there is a rapid drop in the free energy due to a jump of the droplet free surface from one minimum of the binding potential to another .",
    "there is also the usual final long - time approach to equilibrium .",
    "we believe this rich behaviour is due to the complexity of the underlying free energy landscape that exhibits multiple minima , long valleys along which the dynamics is slow and saddle points . to better understand the underlying free energy landscape , we expect a systematic phase plane analysis is required ",
    "i.e.  a systematic examination how diagrams like that in fig .  [ stream ] vary as the parameters in the system are changed .",
    "work in this direction is currently under way .",
    "our extended thin - film hydrodynamic model is also capable of describing the crossover from advective to diffusive dynamics that must occur when the film thickness is of order one particle thick or less .",
    "such a crossover must occur @xcite .",
    "we have shown that when diffusion is included , the droplet spreading is faster , particularly for very small droplets and for all droplets in the latter stages of their approach to equilibrium . incorporating diffusion can also change the dynamic pathway taken  c.f .  the discussion above around fig .",
    "[ g4h0 ] and ref .",
    "@xcite where the nonlinear dynamics of the plateau - rayleigh instability of a liquid ridge is investigated comparing pathways occuring for different mobility functions .",
    "note however that incorporating a small amount of diffusion does not change tanner s law @xcite . recall that tanner s law states that over a significant portion of the spreading time of a radially symmetric liquid drop ( puddle ) , the radius @xmath252 grows in time as @xmath253 , with exponent @xmath254 . for 2d spreading drops like those studied here",
    ", the law still applies , but with exponent @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "we have checked that including moderate diffusion does not change tanner s law , however it does change the pre - factor , so that the overall time for the drop to equilibrate is less with diffusion incorporated .",
    "the extent of the time period that tanner s law holds ( usually after initial transient relaxations to a quasistatic shape up until a change to exponential behaviour during the latter stages of approach to equilibrium ) can also be significantly reduced in our oscillatory binding potential simulations .",
    "this happens , as would be expected , when the majority of the droplet profile lies in the region where terraces form and the greater range of dynamical features occur , creating the rich evolutions we have explored . a final note on the relevance of tanner s law ,",
    "however , is that if a very large diffusion coefficient is imposed then the overriding asymptotic structure of the bulk of the droplet moving with a @xmath110 mobility would break down , and in this situation we could expect an entirely different evolution .",
    "we leave this diffusion dominated regime for possible future work .",
    "the work presented here has largely focused on the simplified oscillatory binding potentials @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "recall that the more complex @xmath80 in eq .",
    "is the one that was obtained as a fit to the dft data @xcite .",
    "additionally , all of these have the hamaker constant @xmath61 .",
    "there is therefore clearly much more work to do understanding the spreading behaviour when realistic binding potentials are used that are valid for all values of film thickness .",
    "comparison of different binding potentials could also be performed for a wider range of fluids , e.g. colloidal fluids , oils , polymeric solutions etc .",
    "other extensions to the present work that would be fruitful include solving for the droplet spreading dynamics in 3d , including gravity , e.g.  to also consider sliding droplets , which exhibit extremely rich behaviour @xcite .",
    "preliminary results indicate that it would also be interesting to study what happens when the initial condition is not symmetric , and also the droplet dynamics in the presence of other droplets .",
    "as a prerequisite to generating the results presented above , we of course conducted convergence tests in order to be certain of the accuracy of the solutions of our numerical analysis . there are some interesting results from this analysis relating to the choice of spatial grid spacing in the discretisation that readers should be aware of if trying to reproduce our results .",
    "equilibrium droplet profile with @xmath159 and with @xmath199 , @xmath202 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , discretising with various grid spacings @xmath258 to obtain the numerical solution , where @xmath259 and where @xmath260 is the total number of grid points .",
    "the values used are @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 . ]    to test accuracy , we calculate droplet evolutions for a series of different mesh discretisations , going to increasingly finer meshes ( i.e.  an increase of the number of points within the interval ) and compare the results with the previous one .",
    "if the results are equal within a small percentage error , the first mesh is good enough . on the other hand ,",
    "if the results differ by a large amount , the same process must be repeated for a finer mesh .",
    "a finer mesh generally results in a more accurate solution and lowers the convergence error , however it requires progressively larger memory and takes more time to compute  particularly for the time evolution given the effective number of odes to be solved increases with the number of grid points .",
    "thus a desirable mesh would combine acceptable accuracy with economical cost .",
    "[ a03 ] shows the sequence of the droplet profiles for @xmath159 with @xmath93 and @xmath256 with different @xmath258 , where @xmath258 is the grid spacing @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the number of grid points and is chosen as @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 .",
    "there is a big step at around @xmath266 for the curves with @xmath267 and @xmath268 which disappears as @xmath258 decreases .",
    "also , the terraces in these two curves are more pronounced compared to the other three curves . thus in this case , a poor mesh grid results in a very different final equilibrium droplet shape .",
    "there is also a loss of volume during the time evolution when the grid spacing is too large , i.e.  the algorithm does not accurately capture the conservation of mass , which must be satisfied in our non - volatile system .",
