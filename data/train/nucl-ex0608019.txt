    "the hot and dense medium created in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is extremely short - lived which requires probes from the early stage of the collision to extract information about the medium and its constituents .",
    "the @xmath1-meson , which is the lightest bound state of hidden strangeness ( @xmath13 ) , can be used as a clean probe from the early stage : the @xmath1 is assumed to have a small cross - section for interactions with non - strange particles  @xcite and it has a relatively long lifetime ( @xmath1441 fm/@xmath5 ) which means it most likely decays outside the fireball , ensuring that its decay daughters do not lose information through rescattering with other hadrons .",
    "previous star measurements  @xcite have ruled out @xmath15 coalescence as a @xmath1-meson production mechanism and therefore the information carried by the @xmath1 should remain unmodified by the hadronic phase .",
    "the elliptic flow parameter , @xmath0 , is an observable which provides information from the early stage of the system s evolution .",
    "information concerning the partonic collectivity of the medium can be extracted from @xmath0 measurements of the @xmath1 by comparing its @xmath0 values with those of particles comprised of the lighter @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks and with other multistrange hadrons ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-meson can also provide information on particle production mechanisms since it is a meson , but at the same time is almost as heavy as a @xmath9 baryon . comparing the @xmath1-meson nuclear modification factor , @xmath8 , with other identified hadrons can help to differentiate between mass - type and meson / baryon - type dependencies of particle production .",
    "medium effects on particle production may be studied through comparison of the @xmath1-meson transverse momentum , @xmath3 , distributions with model expectations .",
    "analysed data are from the au+au runiv 200 gev dataset",
    ". for the @xmath0 and spectral analysis @xmath1413.5 million minimum bias events ( 0 - 80@xmath20 ) were analysed , while @xmath144 million central triggered events were used to obtain @xmath3 spectra in ( 0 - 5@xmath20 ) central collisions .",
    "the @xmath1-meson was reconstructed through its decay to two charged kaons ( branching ratio = @xmath21 ) which were identified through their ionisation energy loss in the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) . to extract the raw yield of @xmath1-mesons , an invariant mass ,",
    "@xmath22 distribution was constructed using all combinations of positively and negatively charged kaons from each event .",
    "the combinatorial background from uncorrelated @xmath23 pairs was estimated using event - mixing , scaled to the same - event distribution and then subtracted .",
    "the resulting @xmath22 distribution was fitted with a breit - wigner distribution ( to describe the shape of the @xmath1 mass peak ) plus a straight line ( for the residual background ) .",
    "the first measurement of the @xmath1-meson elliptic flow , @xmath0 , at @xmath2 gev is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : v2 ] by the solid circles .",
    "the curves represent quark number ( nq ) scaling @xmath0 parameterizations ( dashed for nq = 2 , dot - dashed for nq = 3 ) from  @xcite which indicate the meson and baryon @xmath0 trends as a function of @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : v2 ] is that the @xmath1-meson has a significant @xmath0 , which is comparable to that of other identified particles such as the @xmath7 ( open squares ) and @xmath9 ( open circles )  @xcite as well as the multistrange baryons @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite ( not shown here ) . for @xmath24 gev/@xmath5 ,",
    "the @xmath1-meson @xmath0 seems consistent with a hydrodynamic - type mass - ordering while at intermediate @xmath3 , ( @xmath25 gev/@xmath5 ) , it is more consistent with the @xmath26 of the @xmath7 and the scaling for nq = 2 , than the @xmath9 ( nq = 3 )",
    ". therefore the @xmath1 @xmath0 seems to be determined by its meson properties rather than its mass .",
    "this is further evidence of the particle species - type dependence of @xmath0 observed at intermediate @xmath3 at rhic , and can be described in terms of particle production through quark recombination or coalescence  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factor , @xmath8 , can provide insight on the system created in central compared to peripheral collisions since it describes the yield of @xmath1-mesons produced in central compared to peripheral collisions , scaled by the number of binary collisions ( calculated using a glauber model ) and is given by @xmath27 .     nuclear modification factor , @xmath8 , for two choices of peripheral bin : 40 - 60@xmath20 ( top panel ) and 60 - 80@xmath20 ( bottom panel ) , for the @xmath1-meson ( solid circles ) . also shown are star @xmath8 measurements for @xmath7 ( open triangles ) and @xmath9 ( open squares ) from  @xcite .",

    "similarly to the trend noticed in the @xmath0 measurements , the @xmath1 @xmath8 follows very closely the trend of the @xmath7 rather than the @xmath9 .",

    "[ fig : specratio ] shows the central @xmath1-meson ( solid circles ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath30 ) ( open circles ) spectra compared to recombination model expectations from  @xcite .",
    "this model predicts that the production of @xmath1-mesons and @xmath19-baryons at intermediate @xmath3 ( @xmath318 gev/@xmath5 ) is predominantly due to the recombination of thermal @xmath10-quarks in the medium .",
    "this is shown by the sum of all contributing recombination terms ( solid lines ) being almost identical to the term due to thermal recombination alone ( dashed lines ) i.e. the contribution to @xmath1 and @xmath19 production from fragmentation processes in this model is very small .",
    "these expectations seem to match the trend of the data .",

    "although the data deviate from the model predictions at higher @xmath3 , their trend can be described up to @xmath12 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "in summary , the large @xmath0 of the @xmath1 at low @xmath3 , despite its low cross - section for interactions in the hadronic phase as well as the fact that the @xmath26 scales with nq = 2 , are strong indications of partonic collectivity and deconfinement of the medium created in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the good agreement of the @xmath1-meson @xmath29 with @xmath8 values of other mesons rather than the heavier baryons , provides additional confirmation of the meson / baryon - type dependence of this observable at intermediate @xmath3 .",
    "the scaling of the @xmath0 and @xmath8 values of the @xmath1-meson with nq=2 is expected from recombination and coalescence models of particle production .",
    "in addition , the trend of the central @xmath11 ratio can be described up to @xmath12 gev/@xmath5 by a model based on recombination of thermal strange quarks in the medium ."
