    "domain walls or interfaces play an important role in many transport phenomena and are essential for the understanding of dynamical processes such as magnetic ordering and magnetization reversal . in many interesting situations",
    "quantum mechanics is important to correctly describe the stability , fluctuations , and excitations of magnetic interfaces , and we expect that this is even more true for a reliable description of the dynamics .",
    "equilibrium states describing interfaces in the ising model are well - known since the seminal work by dobrushin @xcite , and many interesting results on interfaces in classical models have been proved since then . in comparison , there have been very few results for quantum models . in the last few years however , some progress has been made and it is the purpose of this paper to review the main results that have been obtained .    in the next four sections we will discuss the following results :    1 .",

    "gapless excitations of the 111 interface in the xxz heisenberg model .",
    "droplet states in the xxz chain .",
    "often , quantum lattice models can be thought of as perturbations of a classical spin system when some parameter in the hamiltonian is not too large ( or too small ) . under certain conditions",
    "its behavior can then be described by a suitable perturbation theory .",
    "the following result is due to borgs , chayes , and frhlich @xcite . in order to simplify the presentation",
    "we do not describe the result in its most general form here .",
    "let @xmath0 be a fixed integer @xmath1 .",
    "for every finite subset @xmath2 , let the hilbert space for the system in volume @xmath3 be given by @xmath4 consider translation invariant local hamiltonians of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a translation invariant isotropic nearest neighbor interaction that is diagonal in a tensor product basis labeled by `` classical configurations '' , i.e. , there is a function @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 . here ,",
    "@xmath9 , and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a basis of @xmath12 .",
    "assume that this classical nearest neighbor interaction has exactly two ground state , of the form @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum perturbation given by the @xmath14 is also assumed to be translation invariant and sufficiently short range in the sense that , for some @xmath15 , sufficiently large , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the usual operator norm , and @xmath18 is the size of the smallest tree subgraph of @xmath19 containing the vertices of @xmath20 .",
    "[ thm : bcf ] under the assumptions described above , and if @xmath21 , the model defined by ( [ bcfmodel ] ) has gibbs states with a rigid interface in the principle coordinate directions , provided that the inverse temperature @xmath22 is sufficiently large and @xmath23 is sufficiently small .",
    "the proof of this theorem relies on recently developed techniques to derive pirogov - sinai type results for quantum lattice models @xcite .",
    "the next two results are examples of interesting situations where perturbation theory as described above , does not apply .",
    "they also illustrate two features that distinguish quantum models from their classical counterparts : 1 ) in a system that has classically several equivalent energy minimizing configurations , ground state selection will typically occur in the quantum model in the same way as tunneling in a symmetric double well potential leads to a unique ground state , and 2 ) finite - state models can have continuous symmetries and gapless energy spectra .",
    "it is expected that the three - dimensional ising model does not have gibbs states with an interface in the 111 direction , due to a large ground state degeneracy for the obvious boundary conditions that would favor such an interface .",
    "a proof of the solid - on - solid version of this statement was given by kenyon @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the falicov - kimball and heisenberg xxz models , in dimensions @xmath1 , this degeneracy is lifted by the `` quantum '' terms , i.e. , ground state selection occurs .",
    "our next result is that , for the half - filled , neutral falicov - kimball model in three dimensions the 111 interface is rigid at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the falicov - kimball model consists of two subsystems living on the same lattice @xmath19 : `` ions '' , described by ising type variables @xmath24 , and `` electrons '' , described by fermion operators @xmath25 .",
    "the ions and electrons interact via an on - site coulomb term as in the hubbard model .",
    "the local hamiltonians are @xmath26 we only consider the half - filled neutral case , i.e. , the number of ions and the number of electrons are both taken to be equal to half the number of lattice sites and we take @xmath27 .",
    "kennedy and lieb proved that , for @xmath28 , this model has an ising type phase transition , with two low - temperature phases dominated by the two checkerboard configurations for the ions @xcite .    in order to study the 111 interface in the three - dimensional model ,",
    "we integrate out the fermion degrees of freedom using the methods of messager and miracle - sol @xcite , and obtain an effective hamiltonian for the ions in terms of the the ising variables @xmath29 : @xmath30 where , and @xmath31 terms of higher order in @xmath32 starting with @xmath33 and also including a weak @xmath22 dependence .",
    "@xmath34 depends on @xmath35 , is translation covariant and satisfies @xmath36 for some @xmath37 , and where @xmath38 is the length of the shortest closed path in the lattice visiting all sites in @xmath39 at least once , and where @xmath34 satisfies a bound of the form @xmath40 analysis of the terms with @xmath41 , indicates that ground state selection indeed occurs for the model with 111 boundary conditions .",
    "the following theorem shows that the 111 interface is stable against thermal fluctuations at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "there exist constants @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , such that for all @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , there exists a gibbs state @xmath48 of the half - filled neutral three - dimensional falicov - kimball model defined by ( [ fkmodel ] ) with the following properties : @xmath49    the falicov - kimball model also exhibits phase separation , i.e. , spontaneous formation of domains of different phases , in the ground state for certain intervals of densities @xcite .",
    "the spin 1/2 xxz heisenberg model defined by @xmath50 with @xmath51 , can also be regarded as a perturbation of the ising model .",
    "kennedy proved that this model has a phase transition for all @xmath28 , @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm : bcf ] applies and interface states in the principal coordinate directions exist for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath53 large enough .",
    "one can also show that for @xmath28 , ground state selection occurs for suitable conditions that favor a diagonal ( 11 , 111 , etc . ) interface .",
    "the model differs from the falicov - kimball model , however , in one important aspect : the existence of a diagonal interface is accompanied by the breaking of a continuous symmetry ( rotations about the third axis ) , and consequently has a gapless spectrum above the ground states .",
    "these gapless excitations were first described by koma and nachtergaele in the two - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "matsui proved their existence in all dimensions @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "i conjecture that the xxz model has a 111 interface gibbs state in three dimensions at low temperatures .",
    "this can not be proved using the standard expansion techniques , which all rely on the existence of a gap .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to first try to understand the gapless excitations of the model .",
    "the third component of the total spin or , equivalently , the number of down spins , is a conserved quantity of the xxz model .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider the interface problem and the excitation spectrum in the canonical ensemble where this quantity is fixed .",
    "the following theorem holds in the canonical ensemble .",
    "an equivalence - of - ensembles result is an essential part of its proof .",
    "let @xmath54 be such that @xmath55 .",
    "then the xxz model with hamiltonian ( [ xxzmodel ] ) , possesses excitations localized in a cylinder with axis in the 111 direction and with a circular intersection of radius @xmath56 with the interface with the energy gap @xmath57 bounded by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an exponent between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , depending on the filling factor @xmath62 of the interface plane and the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "see @xcite for more details and related results .",
    "the last result we would like to present is concerned with droplet states rather than interfaces .",
    "one does not expect that a localized droplet in a translation invariant system can be described by a stationary state , i.e. , an eigenvector , of the hamiltonian . on the other hand",
    ", it seems obvious that for a ferromagnetic model such as the xxz heisenberg hamiltonian , any state of a given finite energy in a sufficiently large volume should be a superposition of states that predominantly consist of a small number of domains each described by one of the ground states .",
    "we have obtained an explicit result of this kind in the one - dimensional case .",
    "let @xmath64}$ ] be the following hamiltonian with `` + '' boundary fields for a chain of @xmath65 spins : @xmath66}=-\\sum_{x=1}^l \\frac{1}{\\delta}(s_x^{1 } s_{x+1}^{1 } + s_x^{2 } s_{x+1}^{2})+   ( s_x^{3 } s_{x+1}^{3 } - \\frac{1}{4 } ) -a(\\delta)(s^3_1+s^3_l ) , \\label{dropletmodel}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 are the standard spin-1/2 matrices and @xmath68 .",

    "the ground state in each of these invariant subspaces is a delocalized droplet of @xmath0 down spins , i.e. , this ground state is dominated by configurations where all @xmath0 down spins are in a subinterval of length @xmath72 , but all such intervals are roughly equally probable .",
    "thus , we expect that the droplet of size @xmath0 behaves as a particle freely moving in an interval of length @xmath73 .",
    "our results on the spectrum show that this particle has mass of order @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is related to the anisotropy by @xmath55 . to state the precise result ,",
    "let @xmath76 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath64}$ ] restricted to @xmath70 , and let @xmath77 be the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "it is convenient , though not necessary , to describe the spectral projection corresponding to the @xmath73 lowest eigenvalues rather than the individual eigenvectors .",
    "define @xmath78 and denote by @xmath79 the corresponding orthogonal projection .",
    "we have no exact expressions for the this spectral projection for finite @xmath0 , but we can describe it with an error of no more than order @xmath80 in the operator norm . to state the result",
    "we need to introduce the `` droplet '' subspace of @xmath70 .",
    "we start with the definition of the kink and antikink states , which are ground state of the model with a different choice of boundary fields @xcite . for every interval @xmath81\\subset{\\mathbb{z}}$ ] , and @xmath82 , the kink and antikink states , @xmath83}(n)$ ] and @xmath84}(n)$ ] respectively , are given by the following expressions : @xmath85}(n ) =     \\sum_{a \\leq x_1 < \\dots < x_n \\leq b } q^{\\sum_{k=1}^n ( b+1-x_k ) }    \\left ( \\prod_{k=1}^n s_{x_k}^- \\right ) { \\lvert\\uparrow \\dots     \\uparrow\\rangle}_{[a , b ] } \\\\",

    "the droplet subspace is now defined as the span of the droplet states at all possible positions : @xmath94 note that @xmath95 , which is the number of subintervals of length @xmath0 of an interval of length @xmath65 . the orthogonal projection onto @xmath96",

    "the spectral subspace @xmath102 spanned by the first @xmath73 eigenvectors , for sufficiently large @xmath0 , is close to the space @xmath103 defined in ( [ kln ] ) .",
