    "hsiang proved that a compact embedded constant mean curvature surface in @xmath1 or in @xmath5 is a rotational sphere .",
    "they used the alexandrov reflection method with vertical planes in order to prove that for any horizontal direction , there is a vertical plane of symmetry of the surface , orthogonal to that direction . to apply the alexandrov reflection method we need to start with a vertical plane orthogonal to a given direction that does not intersect the surface , and in @xmath6",
    "this fact is guaranted by the hypothesis that the surface is contained in a hemisphere times @xmath7 we remark that in @xmath6 we know there are embedded rotational constant mean curvature tori , but the alexandrov problem is not completely solved , as in nil@xmath8 and berger spheres too .    in sol@xmath9 rosenberg proved an embedded compact constant mean curvature surface is a sphere @xcite .",
    "recently , mazet , rodr ' iguez and rosenberg @xcite considered the quotient of @xmath1 by the discrete group of isometries of @xmath1 generated by a horizontal translation along geodesics of @xmath2 and a vertical translation . in this space they proved an alexandrov type theorem ,",
    "i.e. , they classified the compact embedded constant mean curvature surfaces in this quotient space .",
    "moreover , they contructed examples of periodic minimal surfaces in @xmath10 where by periodic we mean a surface which is invariant by a non - trivial discrete group of isometries of @xmath0    in this paper we also consider periodic surfaces in @xmath0 the discrete groups of isometries of @xmath1 we consider are generated by a horizontal translation @xmath11 along horocycles @xmath12 of @xmath2 and/or a vertical translation @xmath13 by some @xmath14 in the case the group is the @xmath15 subgroup of the isometry group generated by @xmath11 and @xmath16 the quotient space @xmath17 $ ] is diffeomorphic but not isometric to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 2-torus .",

    "given two points @xmath52 we denote by @xmath11 the parabolic translation along @xmath12 such that @xmath53        we write @xmath54 to denote the geodesic arc between the two points @xmath55 of @xmath0",
    "take two points @xmath56 for some s , and let @xmath11 be the parabolic translation along @xmath12 such that @xmath53 we have @xmath57 for all @xmath58 consider @xmath59 the @xmath15 subgroup of isom(@xmath1 ) generated by @xmath11 and @xmath16 for some positive @xmath60 we denote by @xmath20 the quotient of @xmath1 by @xmath61 the manifold @xmath20 is diffeomorphic to @xmath62 moreover , @xmath20 is foliated by the family of tori @xmath63 @xmath64 which are intrinsically flat and have constant mean cuvature @xmath22 therefore , the tori @xmath65 are examples of compact embedded constant mean curvature surfaces in @xmath20 .",
    "we have the following answer to the alexandrov problem in @xmath66    [ alexandrov ] let @xmath67 be a compact embedded surface with constant mean curvature @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath68 moreover ,    \\1 . if @xmath69 then @xmath70 is a torus @xmath71 for some @xmath72 and    \\2 . if @xmath73 @xmath70 is either the quotient of a rotational sphere , or the quotient of a vertical unduloid ( in particular , a vertical cylinder over a circle ) .",
    "let @xmath70 be a compact embedded surface in @xmath20 with constant mean curvature @xmath74 as @xmath70 is compact , there exist @xmath75 such that @xmath70 is between @xmath76 and @xmath77 and it is tangent to @xmath78 at points @xmath79 respectively , as illustrated in the figure below .",
    "for @xmath80 does not touch @xmath70 and @xmath70 stays in the mean convex region bounded by @xmath76 . by comparison at @xmath81",
    "we conclude that @xmath68 if @xmath69 then by the maximum principle @xmath70 is the torus @xmath82 and we have already proved the first part of the thereom .    to proof the last part , consider a connected component @xmath83 of the lift of @xmath70 to @xmath84=\\mathbb h^2\\times\\mathbb s^1.$ ] denote by @xmath85 the surface @xmath86 note that @xmath85 is the lift of @xmath65 to @xmath87    @xmath88 separates @xmath89    in fact ,",
    "if it is not the case , we can consider a geodesic arc @xmath90 such that @xmath91 and we can join the points @xmath92 by a curve that does not intersect @xmath93 hence we obtain a jordan curve whose intersection number with @xmath88 is 1 modulo 2 .",
    "note that each point of @xmath88 has bounded distance to @xmath94 since we can homotop the jordan curve such that its points are an arbitrary distance from @xmath95 we conclude that this jordan curve does not intersect @xmath88 anymore , contradicting the fact that its intersection number is 1 modulo 2 .",
    "thus the claim is proved .",
    "let us call @xmath96 the mean convex component of @xmath97 with boundary @xmath88 and @xmath98 the other component , hence @xmath99 also , let @xmath100 whose projections in @xmath20 are @xmath55 respectively .",
    "let @xmath101 be a geodesic in @xmath2 that limits to @xmath102 ( the point where the horocycles @xmath12 are centered ) and consider @xmath103 the family of geodesics in @xmath2 orthogonal to @xmath104 denote by @xmath105 the totally geodesic vertical annulus @xmath106 of @xmath107 since @xmath88 is a lift of the compact surface @xmath108 it stays in the region between @xmath109 and @xmath95 and the distance from any point of @xmath88 to @xmath109 and to @xmath110 is uniformly bounded .",
    "for @xmath46 large , @xmath105 is contained in @xmath98 and disjoint from @xmath111 moreover , @xmath105 has points at an arbitrary distance from @xmath109 .",
    "it follows that @xmath112 is compact for all @xmath113 and is empty if @xmath114 is large enough .",
    "then start with @xmath46 close to infinity and let @xmath46 decrease until a first contact point between @xmath88 and @xmath115 by the maximum principle , we know that the mean curvature vector of @xmath88 does not point into @xmath116    let us suppose @xmath117 has at least two points . continuing to decrease @xmath46 and start alexandrov reflection procedure for @xmath88 and the family of vertical totally geodesic annuli @xmath118",
    "we get a first contact point between the reflected part of @xmath88 and @xmath93 for some @xmath119 then @xmath88 is symmetric with respect to @xmath120 but @xmath121 is compact , and then @xmath88 is compact .",
    "hence , given any horizontal geodesic @xmath122 that limits to @xmath51 ( or to any other point in @xmath123 ) we can apply the alexandrov procedure with the family of totally geodesic vertical annulus @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the family of horizontal geodesics orthogonal to @xmath126 and we obtain a symmetry plane .",
    "hence we have shown that if some geodesic that limits to @xmath51 intersects @xmath88 in two or more points , then @xmath88 lifts to a rotational cylindricaly bounded surface @xmath127 in @xmath0 if @xmath127 is non compact then @xmath127 is a delauney surface and if @xmath127 is compact , by the hsiang - hsiang s theorem , we know that @xmath127 is a rotational sphere .",
    "now , let us suppose every geodesic that limits to @xmath51 intersects @xmath88 in at most one point .",

    "in this section we are interested in constructing minimal surfaces which are invariant by a subgroup of isom(@xmath1 ) isomorphic to @xmath15 or generated by a vertical translation . in fact , we only consider subgroups generated by a parabolic translation @xmath11 along a horocycle and/or a vertical translation @xmath16 for some @xmath141 .",
    "denote by @xmath36 the geodesic lines in @xmath142 @xmath37 respectively .",

    "we have @xmath148 for some @xmath149 consider a point @xmath150 parametrize so that when @xmath151 we have @xmath152 @xmath153 and @xmath154        we fix @xmath155 and consider the following jordan curve :    @xmath156    , height=151 ]    we consider a least area embedded minimal disk @xmath157 with boundary @xmath158 as @xmath159 is tranversal to the killing field @xmath160 we can show using the maximum principle that @xmath157 is a @xmath161-killing graph with convex boundary , in particular , @xmath157 is stable and unique ( see lemma 2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this gives uniform curvature estimates far from the boundary .",
    "following appendix c in @xcite , we can show @xmath162 is a vertical graph and then it can be extended by symmetry with respect to @xmath163 to a larger vertical graph .",
