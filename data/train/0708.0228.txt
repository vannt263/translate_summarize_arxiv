    "over the past 10 years the number of known high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) located in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has been steadily increasing .",
    "there are now approximately 50 such systems known in the smc @xcite . until recently the majority of x - ray observations by _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ have concentrated on the bar , since the large fraction of hmxbs",
    "are located in this region .",
    "@xcite analysed the locations of the known x - ray pulsars and believed there to be a relationship between the hi intensity distribution and the distribution of the pulsars .",
    "this prompted a large survey of the wing of the smc using _",
    "a total of 20 individual pointings were made of approximately 10ks each .",
    "the survey was successful in finding two new pulsars ( sxp65.8 and sxp700 ) and detecting two previously known pulsars ( sxp101 and sxp348 ) .",

    "spectral classification of be stars in the smc is particularly difficult .",
    "classification of be stars in the galaxy relies on using the ratios of many metal lines @xcite , unfortunately the metallicity of smc stars is lower than those in the galaxy and so these metal lines appear extremely weak and are often not present .",
    "there is also the added difficulty that the balmer lines in particular will be rotationally broadened and hence obscure any comparisons to neighbouring lines .",
    "other difficulties are added when we consider the effect of the circumstellar disk .",
    "we often get h@xmath0 emission originating from the circumstellar disk but we can also see the circumstellar disks effect on the higher order balmer lines though in - filling . as a result we use the classification criteria and methods as set out by @xcite and @xcite .    for the luminosity classification",
    "we have adopted the classification method set out in @xcite , however since this method relies on line ratios we face all the same difficulties as previously mentioned .",
    "we have also performed a check on this luminosity classification by comparing the absolute magnitude of the source in the v - band with the spectral classification obtained . here we have adopted a distance modulus for the smc of 18.9 and we use the relevant tables in @xcite . these tables are based on absolute magnitudes from hipparcos data . although the luminosities of be stars in the smc may differ somewhat to those in the milky way we have adopted this method as a check and recognise that in some cases the results obtained may be uncertain .",

    "this source had first been identified as a possible counterpart in january 2000 due to its r - h@xmath0 colour revealing an excess of h@xmath0 .",
    "subsequently this source was observed 4 years later in 2004 using the 1.9 m saao telescope , two spectra taken on the night have been co - added and are shown in figure  [ fi101 ha ] .",
    "we can clearly see the h@xmath0 line to be in absorption , hence the source was not considered to be a prime candidate .",

    "two spectra were taken consecutively and have been co - added to increase the signal to noise .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile now appears to be slightly in emission , suggesting its be nature .",

    "comparison of all three spectra with those given in figure  4 of @xcite would seem to place the counterpart in a broad spectral range of b1-b5 .",
    "mgii 4481  is possibly present in all three spectra in particular the salt and aat ones , however the resolution of the eso spectra is not sufficient to deblend the line from the neighbouring hei line .",
    "if the presence of this line is to be believed , then combined with the lack of siiii 4553  allows a lower classification limit of b3 to be made @xcite .",
    "visable in the aat spectra is the siii blend of 4128/4132  and hei line at 4143 .",

    "the ratio of siii to hei line would suggest a classification around b8 @xcite .",
    "this line ratio is not seen in the eso spectra , in fact siii is barely seen and the hei line appears strongly suggesting a classification more like b5 .",
    "a classification range of b3-b5 would agree with the balmer lines appearing very broad and deep which is typical of a mid range be star .",
    "the luminosity classification method of @xcite only goes as far as classifying b2 stars , hence we will only use the estimate from the v - band magnitude .",
    "we would estimate the luminosity class to be about ib - ii from table  10 presented in @xcite .",
    "a luminosity class of ib - ii would make the counterpart a supergiant and not a be star .",
    "this luminosity classification should be treated cautiously due to the methods used .",

    "three red follow up spectra taken within a few months of each other by salt , aat and saao reveal the counterpart star to have a very strong h@xmath0 line in emission ( figure  [ fi700 ha ] ) .",
    "this strongly suggests the identification of this object as a be / x - ray binary .",
    "the three observations were roughly spaced a month apart from each other .",
    "it can be seen in table  [ taobs ] that the equivalent width of h@xmath0 has barely changed over the course of these observations indicating that the circumstellar disk was in a fairly stable state .",

    "a recent spectrum ( figure  [ fi348 ha ] ) taken on 08 november 2006 shows h@xmath0 to be back in emission , this time with a slightly more prominent feature on the red shoulder making it appear more double peaked .",
    "the eso spectrum ( figure  [ fieso ] ) taken near to this most recent red spectrum shows the h@xmath3 line to be largely filled in with an emission peak at its centre .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile has also shrunk in size quite dramatically since it was observed in 1992 @xcite , they report an equivalent width of -22  however they did not note anything about the physical shape of the emission .",
    "the h@xmath3 line has also reduced in size since 1992 , where they reported an equivalent width of -1.7 .    from the eso spectra ( figure  [ fieso ] )",
    "we can see a strong heii line at 4686 ; this firmly restricts the spectral class to earlier than b1 .",
    "further constraints can be made based on the presence of very weak heii at 4541  and 4200  in the eso spectra .",
    "a spectral classification of b0-b0.5 can be placed on this counterpart @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the spectral range of o9-b1  ( v - iii ) determined in @xcite , where they estimate the spectral class to around b0 based on the strength of hei 4471  relative to its neighbour mgii 4481 .",
    "the presence of heii 4686  was uncertain in their spectrum due to a flat fielding correction . using the same hei and siiv lines in the eso spectrum for the luminosity classification as used for sxp700 yields a very similar situation , strong hei lines and a moderate bump representing siiv on the shoulder of h@xmath4 . using this ratio a luminosity classification of v",

    "since these spectra are both of high quality and show no astrophysical difference we have only included one of them here .",
    "the strong h@xmath0 emission line present in the aat spectra strongly suggests that the counterpart is indeed a be / x - ray binary . in the few months between the aat and saao",
    "spectra the h@xmath0 line has significantly modified its profile to a double peaked structure .",
    "this would indicate that the circumstellar disk has shrunk in size and now the absorption in the stellar photosphere is becoming a more dominant effect .",

    "several silicon lines can help to refine the classification .",
    "the presence of a strong siiii 4553  line in the aat spectrum is dubious since it falls on a dead pixel , however , the continuum does appear to take a strong dip just before and then rise just after as if the line were present .",

    "<S> we investigate the optical counterparts of recently discovered be / x - ray binaries in the small magellanic cloud . in total four sources , sxp101 , sxp700 , sxp348 and sxp65.8 were detected during the _ chandra _ survey of the wing of the smc . </S>",
    "<S> sxp700 and sxp65.8 were previously unknown . </S>",
    "<S> many optical ground based telescopes have been utilised in the optical follow - up , providing coverage in both the red and blue bands . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to the classification of all of the counterparts as be stars and confirms that three lie within the galactic spectral distribution of known be / x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> sxp101 lies outside this distribution becoming the latest spectral type known . </S>",
    "<S> monitoring of the h@xmath0 emission line suggests that all the sources bar sxp700 have highly variable circumstellar disks , possibly a result of their comparatively short orbital periods . </S>",
    "<S> phase resolved x - ray spectroscopy has also been performed on sxp65.8 , revealing that the emission is indeed harder during the passage of the x - ray beam through the line of sight .    </S>",
