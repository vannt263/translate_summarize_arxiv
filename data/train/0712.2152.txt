    "studies of stability , dewetting and rupture of thin liquid films on solid substrates are of great importance for micro- and nanotechnologies . since the first works appeared in 1960s and 1970s ,",
    "these subjects continue to attract enormous attention , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite are the reviews of recent results in this extremely diverse field .",
    "the subject of this paper is the general theoretical investigation of the impact of the vibration on the stability of a thin dewetting liquid film .",
    "our interest in studying vibration impacts stems from the large body of works in fluid mechanics of macroscopic fluid layers , including refs .",
    "@xcite ( the experiment ) and refs .",
    "@xcite ( the theory and numerical modeling ) , where the vibration is shown to drastically affect the stability characteristics and the dynamics of fluid surfaces and interfaces .",
    "in this paper we assume that the external influences on the film are the vibration , the gravity , and the long - range molecular attraction by the planar substrate , typified by van der waals forces .",
    "other effects ( such as , for instance , the thermocapillarity and the evaporation ) can be easily included by simply adding the corresponding terms to the final evolution equation for the film thickness .",
    "the theory we develop is based on the standard longwave lubrication approximation , as discussed by oron , davis , and bankoff @xcite , and on the time - averaging method .",
    "the general discussion of the averaging methods can be found in refs .",
    "the key idea is the separation of the dynamics onto fast pulsations and slow relaxation processes .",
    "this approach works well when the vibration frequency is high in a certain sense , i.e. when there exists a large difference in the characteristic times ( such as the viscous relaxation time and the vibration period , see below ) .",
    "the first transparent explanation of such separation of the time scales was given by kapitza in his pioneering work on a pendulum with an oscillating point of support @xcite .",
    "the paper by blekhman @xcite contains other examples in mechanics .",
    "many examples of the successful application of the averaging method can be found in thermal vibrational convection @xcite , dynamics of inclusions in fluids @xcite , dynamics of granular materials @xcite , motion of disperse fluids @xcite , and filtration of inclusions in porous media @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the vibration of the solid plate ( on which the fluid system is located ) often is capable of complete suppression of instabilities .",
    "for example , wolf @xcite experimentally investigated the damping of the rayleigh - taylor instability in the horizontal two - layer system by a vertical high frequency vibration .",
    "the theoretical analysis of this situation ( in the linear approximation ) by the averaging technique was performed by cherepanov @xcite ( summary of this paper can be found in ref .",
    "the longwave instability in this system was also analyzed by lapuerta , mancebo , and vega @xcite .",
    "after the analysis of the linear longwave instability at the moderate vibration frequency , they proceed to the averaged description at high frequency .",
    "the generalization of the latter analysis to the nonisothermal situation was developed by thiele , vega , and knobloch @xcite .",
    "they account for the marangoni effect and perform a detailed investigation of the corresponding amplitude equation .",
    "another widespread vibration - induced phenomenon is the parametric excitation , which emerges when the frequency of the vibration is comparable to one of the eigenfrequencies of the system ( for instance , to the frequency of the capillary - gravity waves ) .",
    "faraday was first to observe parametric waves on the surface of vertically oscillating horizontal layer @xcite .",
    "linear and nonlinear analyses of parametric instability were performed , for instance , by benjamin & ursell , kumar & tuckerman @xcite , lyubimov & cherepanov , and by mancebo and vega @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the latter paper is the most detailed study to - date of the linear aspects of faraday instability .",
    "it must be noted that the situations termed  the averaged motion \" and  the parametric instability \" are often closely connected , although they operate within different intervals of the vibration frequencies .",
    "indeed , in the studies of the averaged dynamics one has to ensure stability of the pulsatile motion ( periodic in time ) .",
    "most fluid systems have an eigenfrequency spectrum unbounded from above and thus the eigenfrequency is an increasing function of the mode number .",
    "thus , even the high - frequency vibration is capable of parametric excitation of the higher modes . for the pulsatile motion to be stable ,",
    "a window of parameters such as the amplitude and the frequency of the vibration must be chosen , where the parametric instability does not emerge .",
    "it is also worth noting that most papers @xcite , where the averaging method is employed , deal with the vibration of `` inviscid '' frequency , i.e. the vibration period @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is the dimensional frequency ) is assumed small compared to the characteristic time of viscous relaxation , @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath4 is the mean fluid layer thickness ) .",
    "it is clear that this assumption is quite reasonable for macroscopic layers , but for thin films ( of thickness @xmath5 ) it requires extremely large frequencies , @xmath6 and higher .",
    "now , we make a very important point , as follows .",
    "a _ thin film _ allows for averaged description even when _ the viscosity is large _",
    "[ i.e. , @xmath7 and even @xmath8 : one needs only to assume that the period of the vibration is _ small compared to the characteristic time of the film evolution _",
    ", @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 is the wavenumber ) .",
    "due to the lubrication approximation , @xmath11 .",
    "thus the condition @xmath12 is much milder than the usual inviscid approximation @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the averaging procedure can be applied even to _",
    "ultrathin films_.    to the best of our knowledge the only paper developing similar approximation is ref .",
    "@xcite , where the linear stability problem is studied for `` moderate '' ( `` finite '' ) non - dimensional frequencies @xmath14 .",
    "however , by assuming the amplitude of the vibration `` finite '' ( which means that it is of the order of the fluid layer thickness ) , the authors obtain that the impact of the vibration at moderate frequency is small .",
    "thus , they focus on the high - frequency , small - amplitude case @xmath15 .",
    "in this paper we assume _ large _ vibration amplitude and develop the _ nonlinear _ amplitude equation for the thickness of the film .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the mathematical formulation of the problem is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : first ] .",
    "we state and discuss assumptions and governing equations . in particular , the separation of the processes onto fast pulsatile and slow averaged motions is performed in sec .",

    "_ this equation is the main result of this paper .",
    "it can be used to study impacts of the vertical vibration ( in the frequency range for which the averaged description is applicable ) on the dynamics of a film , in the presence of the surface tension and wetting interactions with the substrate . _ two limiting cases of `` low '' and `` high '' vibration frequency are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : limit ] .",
    "these cases correspond to the different ratios of the inertial and viscous forces in the oscillatory motion .",

    "conditions of parametric instability of the oscillatory motion are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : stab ] , where the faraday instability and the shear flow instability are discussed .",
    "we show that for any admissible vibration frequency there exists a finite range of vibration amplitudes for which such instabilities are not present . in sec .",
    "[ sec : layer ] we address the averaged behavior of the system within the framework of the obtained amplitude equation .",
    "results of linear and weakly nonlinear analyses of the equilibrium state with the flat surface are presented , as well as the results of direct numerical simulations .",
    "in particular , we show that the vibration influence is _ stabilizing _ , i.e. it can delay or completely suppress the film rupture by intermolecular attractive forces .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] summarizes the results .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) , laterally unbounded thin liquid film of unperturbed thickness @xmath4 on a planar , horizontal substrate .",
    "the cartesian reference frame is chosen such that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes are in the substrate plane and the @xmath18axis is normal to the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the substrate - film system is subjected to the vertical harmonic vibration of the amplitude @xmath19 and the frequency @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in the reference frame of the substrate the acceleration of gravity is modulated , @xmath20 since @xmath4 is small , the intermolecular interaction of the film surface with the substrate has to be taken into account .",
    "thus , we prescribe the potential energy @xmath21 to the unit length of the film layer . in this paper",
    "we consider only the van der waals attractive potential , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the hamaker constant @xcite .",
    "the model presented in this paper can be readily extended to incorporate other models of wetting interactions  it is only necessary to replace @xmath21 with an appropriate function .",
    "we scale the time , the length , the velocity and the pressure by @xmath24 , respectively ( here , @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath25 is the density of the liquid ) . then , the liquid motion is governed by the following non - dimensional problem :    [ base_eq ] @xmath26    [ base_bcs ] @xmath27    here , @xmath28 is the fluid velocity , @xmath29 is its component normal to the substrate , @xmath30 is the pressure in the liquid , @xmath31 is the viscous stress tensor , @xmath32 is the dimensionless thickness of the layer , @xmath33 is the unit vector directed along the @xmath18 axis , @xmath34 is the normal unit vector to the free surface , @xmath35 is the mean curvature of the free surface , @xmath36 [ where @xmath37 is the non - dimensional hamaker constant ] , @xmath38 is the capillary number ( where @xmath39 is the surface tension ) , @xmath40 is the galileo number , @xmath41 is the non - dimensional amplitude , and @xmath42 is the non - dimensional frequency .",
    "we consider the nonlinear evolution of the large - scale perturbations .",
    "as it is usually done , we introduce small parameter @xmath43 , which is of the order of the ratio of the mean thickness @xmath4 to the perturbation wavelength , i.e. @xmath44 for long waves .    below for the sake of simplicity and for more transparent presentation of ideas ,",
    "we consider the 2d model , assuming that @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the unit vector directed along the @xmath16 axis , and all fields are independent of @xmath47 .",
    "the theory extends trivially in three dimensions at the replacement of the @xmath48-derivative by the 2d gradient .",
    "we derive the 3d analogue in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] .",
    "next we introduce the conventional stretched coordinates and the time : @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "now we rescale the velocity components as follows : @xmath51 to this end , both the pressure @xmath30 and the surface position @xmath52 remain unscaled .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the capillary number is large : @xmath53 this is quite realistic and widely used assumption @xcite .    substituting the expansions ( [ coords])-([ca ] ) into the problem ( [ base_eq ] ) and ( [ base_bcs ] ) we arrive at the following set of equations and boundary conditions :    [ perturb_eq ] @xmath54    [ perturb_bcs ] @xmath55    all terms of order @xmath56",
    "have been omitted .      in this paper",
    "we consider the case of moderate vibration frequency : @xmath57 , i.e. the vibration period is small compared to the characteristic time of the surface evolution .",
    "this assumption makes possible the averaging of the dynamics of the film over the vibration period @xcite .",
    "the main purpose is the rigorous asymptotic analysis ( in powers of @xmath43 ) which results in the set of equations and boundary conditions , where the dependence on @xmath58 is averaged out .",
    "this set is then used to derive the amplitude equation for the thickness of the film . as for @xmath59 ,",
    "this quantity is _ not an asymptotic parameter_. this means that , generally speaking , we assume @xmath59 neither large nor small",
    ". therefore @xmath59 will enter the amplitude equation as a finite parameter .",
    "however , within the framework of the equation set ( [ perturb_eq ] ) and ( [ perturb_bcs ] ) we will consider three qualitatively different cases :    \\(i ) @xmath60 , i.e. the vibration is of `` low '' frequency ; this is the quasi - stokes approximation with week influence of fluid inertia .",
    "note that in this case , due to eqs .",
    "( [ coords ] ) , the condition @xmath61 must be retained to legalize the averaging procedure .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath62 .",
    "this assumption means that the vibration period is comparable to the time of the momentum relaxation across the layer , @xmath63 .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath64 , i.e. the vibration is of `` high '' frequency ; viscosity is negligible except for the thin boundary layer near the rigid wall . as usual",
    ", the boundary layer in the vicinity of the free surface does not play an important role ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) .",
    "since the van der waals interaction is important for films of thickness @xmath65 , let us estimate the typical values of @xmath59 .",
    "taking @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( viscosity of water ) , we obtain @xmath68 for @xmath69 ( typical for mechanical vibrator ) , and @xmath70 for @xmath71 ( typical for ultrasound ) .",
    "therefore the case ( i ) can be easily achieved either mechanically or by means of ultrasound irradiation of the substrate from below , the case ( ii ) can be reached only using the ultrasound , and the case ( iii ) seems unrealistic .",
    "nevertheless we shall consider this case below , since our results , upon neglecting @xmath72 , can as well be applied to the description of macroscopic fluid layers .",
    "besides , this limiting case was studied in detail by many authors and therefore it allows for the verification of our results .",
    "we represent each field @xmath73 as the sum of the average part @xmath74 and the pulsation @xmath75 , where @xmath58 and @xmath76 can now be termed the `` fast '' and the `` slow '' times , respectively @xcite . thus , we write    [ splitting ] @xmath77    we now assume that @xmath78 i.e. the amplitude of the vibration is _ large _ compared to the mean film thickness .",
    "this assumption seems surprising as it is customary to impose the _ small - amplitude _ high frequency vibration .",
    "however , large amplitudes are permitted when the large - scale dynamics is considered .",
    "indeed , it is shown below that due to the longwave approximation the impact of the vibration becomes non - negligible only at large amplitudes .",
    "also , it will be made clear momentarily that in some sense the pulsatile motion is still small - amplitude .",
    "the assumption of large vibration amplitude means that the oscillating part of the pressure field @xmath79 ( which is forced by the inertia force @xmath80 ) is of order @xmath81 , which in turn leads to @xmath81 scaling for the velocities of the pulsation @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the pulsation of the surface height @xmath84 obviously has the same order as @xmath85 [ see eq . ( [ velo ] ) ] , i.e. it is of the order @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to redefine the pulsation parts of all fields , rewriting eqs .",
    "( [ splitting ] ) as follows    [ rescaling ] @xmath86    where @xmath87 and @xmath84 are @xmath88 quantities .",

    "( [ pres_scal ] ) .",
    "note that the pulsations of the fluid velocity and the pressure are larger than their mean parts , while the opposite is true for the pulsation of the film height .",
    "moreover , the scaling ( [ rescaled_velo ] ) means that the pulsation remains `` small - amplitude '' . indeed , the typical horizontal ( vertical ) displacement of the fluid particle during one period is @xmath88 [ @xmath90 , which is small in comparison with the respective characteristic lengthscale , @xmath91 [ @xmath88 ] .",
    "substitution of the expansions ( [ rescaling ] ) in the equation sets ( [ perturb_eq ] ) and ( [ perturb_bcs ] ) allows to separate fast pulsations from background slow ( averaged ) motions . keeping terms of zeroth and first orders in @xmath43 , we obtain the following sets .",
