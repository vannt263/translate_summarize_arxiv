    "( we refer a reader to the following review articles  @xcite for a detailed discussion and comparison of different experimental proposals . ) the presence or absence of majorana zero - energy modes in one - dimensional topological superconductors can be detected by measuring tunneling local density of states at the ends of the wire .",
    "shortly after the majorana wire proposals  @xcite , there have been several experimental reports  @xcite of zero - bias tunneling conductance in superconductor / semiconductor nanowire devices , which can be interpreted as a signature of majorana zero - energy modes .",

    "[ sec : mainresults ] , we summarize our main findings and provide a qualitative explanation of the temperature and voltage dependence of the conductance using a two - step rg procedure .",

    "the presence of the lead is not important here since @xmath8 , and we assume that @xmath9 .    without loss of generality , we focus here on the transport properties of a spinless nanowire coupled to a spinless 1d superconductor . for simplicity , we consider below a single - band nanowire but our results should also be applicable to multi - band superconductor / semiconductor heterostructures as well  @xcite . throughout this paper , we will assume that the superconductor is fully gapped and sufficiently long so that the splitting between majorana end states can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the ll is effectively coupled only to @xmath10 , see fig.[fig : setup ] , which is the only relevant low - energy superconducting degree of freedom in the problem .",
    "taking into account the aforementioned assumptions , the effective model for the topological superconductor - ll junction becomes ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi velocity and @xmath14 represents right / left - moving excitations near the fermi energy .",

    "we will show below how to resolve this contradiction .",
    "it turns out that the noninteracting result is non - generic and as soon as we include interactions in the nanowire ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , the scalings of the conductance with @xmath38 and @xmath39 become the same .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss how interparticle interactions in the nanowire affect transport properties of the tp sc / ll junction .",
    "interaction effects in the topological superconductor itself have been previously discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of these publications is that weak interparticle interactions do not destroy the topological superconducting state but rather lead to the renormalization of some physical parameters , such as induced coherence length .",
    "therefore , the simplified description of a majorana wire in terms of two delocalized zero - energy modes captures the basic physics of an interacting topological superconductor .",
