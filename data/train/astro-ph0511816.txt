    "one of the outstanding challenges of cosmology is to relate the more theoretical aspect of the standard cosmological model , in the form of the large scale distribution of dark matter as seen in high resolution n - body simulations , to the observational evidence , as reflected by large galaxy surveys . or , in a directly related question , what is the relation between observable properties of galaxies and computable properties of dark matter haloes ?",
    "the traditional route to looking at this problem has been to follow the theory of galaxy formation .",
    "this can be tested through the results of hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , which combine dark matter with baryons , or semi - analytical models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "this is a powerful way of looking at the problem , since it provides a direct answer , and a galaxy formation theory is an end goal in itself .",
    "there are , however , some problems : first and foremost , the theory behind galaxy formation has several components which are ill understood , and where the best approach remains phenomenological . at the same time , the required very high resolution , large scale , full hydrodynamical simulations including magnetic fields and radiative transfer are beyond current computing resources .    in the past few years",
    ", a new approach has appeared which is in many ways an alternative : this consists of an indirect method , associating galaxy and dark matter halo properties in an empirical manner .",
    "this is usually done through a statistical approach , either by focusing directly on the number of galaxies in each halo , as is done in halo occupation distribution models @xcite , or through the luminosity distribution of the galaxies in a halo , like the conditional luminosity function approach @xcite , or finally by building a direct relation between mass and luminosity @xcite .    in the present paper , we take the latter approach .",
    "we use new , high resolution simulation results for the subhalo mass distribution , together with a self consistent approximation to subhalo mass loss , to build the total distribution of dark matter hosts based on physical theory .",
    "together with the empirically determined galaxy luminosity function , this yields a mass luminosity relation for an individual galaxy and the halo or subhalo which hosts it .",
    "this is in part an updated version of the preliminary model shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the non - parametric model and the main concepts behind it . in section 3 , we look in some detail at the subhalo mass function , introducing a prescription for subhalo mass loss and in particular looking at how to define this mass function in terms of the original , pre - merger into parent , mass of the subhaloes . in section 4 , we give the main results for our base model , using the k - band luminosity function from the 2mass survey . in section 5 , we look at how the model results change depending on the luminosity function ( and hence waveband ) used , as well as the effect of changing the underlying cosmological model and what we find is the most relevant parameter of the subhalo mass function , the low mass slope .",
    "we also look at potential problems with the observational mass determination .",
    "we present additional checks of the model in section 6 , by calculating the predicted mass to light ratio , occupation number , group luminosity function and multiplicity function .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 7 .",
    "the basic idea behind the non - parametric model is to assume a monotonic and one to one relation between the luminosity of a galaxy and the mass of the dark matter halo or subhalo which hosts it .",
    "this comes from the standard picture that galaxies are formed in haloes through the accretion of gas , the amount of which is a monotonic function of the depth of the potential well of the halo and thus of its mass . by including the subhaloes",
    ", we are assuming that all galaxies are either hosted individually in a parent halo , or in the case of multiple systems like clusters in one of the subhaloes .",
    "in fact , we assume that counting haloes and subhaloes accounts for all hosts , and exclude complications such as conditions during ongoing mergers .",
    "groups and clusters are then formed when haloes merge ; the end result of such a build up is to have a central galaxy , which formed in the most massive of the initial haloes ( which subsequently became the parent ) , and satellite galaxies in the smallest haloes which were accreted and which became subhaloes .    using this basic concept ,",
    "it becomes possible to obtain an average relation between the luminosity of a galaxy and its host halo / subhalo mass by matching the numbers of each , the former from large scale galaxy surveys , the latter from dark matter simulations .",
    "the average luminosity @xmath10 of a galaxy in a halo or subhalo of mass @xmath11 will then simply be given by :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the galaxy luminosity function and @xmath14 is the sum of the halo and subhalo mass functions .    during and",
    "after the halo merging process significant star formation in the subhalo declines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so we will take as a constraint that the amount of gas accreted by what becomes a subhalo , and which will thus be available to form a satellite galaxy , will be proportional not to the mass it has at present , but to the maximum mass it had before being accreted by its parent halo and undergoing mass loss to tidal stripping and dynamical friction .",
    "this is supported by some recent work of @xcite , who use high resolution n - body simulations together with semi - analytical modelling of the formation of galaxies to study the distribution of satellites in milky way type galaxies .",
    "they find that while the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies is significantly different from that of the most massive present day subhaloes , it is well matched by that of the subset of subhaloes with the most massive progenitors .",
    "it is then necessary to use not the distribution of subhaloes as a function of their present mass , but instead of the original mass they had prior to accretion into the parent and subsequent mass loss , regardless of theoretical issues related to galaxy formation .",
    "we circumvent this problem by coupling the present , evolved subhalo mass function with a prescription for the amount of mass loss , together with some simple arguments on the total mass contained in these subhalo progenitors , in order to regain the initial mass of a subhalo at the moment of accretion and tag each of these by its initial mass .",
    "as discussed , the first step to having a workable non - parametric model is to account for the amount of mass loss in subhaloes . to obtain it ,",
    "we adapt the results of @xcite , by comparing the results they give for the evolved and unevolved ( original ) subhalo mass functions .",
    "if we assume that the present and original masses of the subhaloes are related monotonically ( that is , that the most massive of the original subhaloes are still the most massive at present , independently of the actual amount of mass loss ) , we can obtain this relation by comparing the total numbers of present subhaloes to their original progenitors , in a manner similar to the process presented above for the non - parametric model .    the resulting mass loss factors will depend on both the subhalo mass and the mass of the parent halo , as can be seen in figure [ massloss ] .",
    "in fact , we have made a small further change to the results we obtain from the mass functions of @xcite , which is to flatten the mass loss factor to a constant at its minimum and so maintain monotonicity .",
    "the upturn at high subhalo mass is explained by two competing factors which contribute to mass loss : while the more massive subhaloes lose a larger fraction of their mass in each orbit within the parent halo , they will also , on average , have formed and therefore been accreted later , which means they will have undergone fewer of these orbits than less massive subhaloes ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    ", which is a function both of subhalo and parent halo mass",
    ". plotted are curves for three different parent halo masses , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , from top to bottom respectively .",
    "these curves have the normalization we obtained directly from adopting the results of @xcite ; it may be necessary to renormalize them when considering different present subhalo mass functions ( see text for discussion ) .",
    ", height=317 ]    we can now apply this mass loss factor to subhalo mass functions measured from simulation results to obtain the original subhalo mass function .",
    "there is an important further consideration , though : care must be taken with the normalization of this function .",
    "in fact , we know that the sum of the mass in these original subhaloes must equal the total present mass in the parent halo , since the latter is built up by accreting and stripping subhaloes ( ignoring for simplicity the small amount of mass associated with subhaloes that disappear totally ) . therefore , when using different subhalo mass functions , the result presented in figure [ massloss ] should be taken only to be the shape of the mass loss factor .",
    "it is then necessary to either renormalize the mass loss factor ( or alternatively the derived original subhalo mass function ) to ensure that the total mass in these original subhaloes matches the present mass of the parent halo .",
    "the distribution of the subhaloes is based on the subhalo mass function ( shmf ) , @xmath18 , which gives the number of subhaloes in the mass range @xmath19 to @xmath20 for a parent halo of mass @xmath11 .",
    "we start by defining the present day mass fraction in subhaloes as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the mass of the most massive subhalo possible , which we take to be a function of the parent halo mass .",
    "this value will be set by assuming that the maximum original mass is half the total mass of the parent , @xmath23 .",
    "this is in fact a question of definition , since a subhalo which had a mass greater than this would actually be larger than any other it could be merging with , and would itself in fact be the parent halo .",
    "this can be converted back to @xmath24 by using the mass loss factor .",
    "this mass fraction in subhaloes is generally found to be a growing function of parent halo mass , both in simulations or semi - analytical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "this is naturally due to the later formation of more massive haloes , therefore allowing less time for mass loss to occur .",
    "there also seems to be some agreement that the value of this mass fraction should be just under 10% , even at high halo mass . this will have as an important consequence that the subhalo mass function can not possibly be universal but must depend on @xmath11 , since the subhalo mass fraction in effect sets its normalization .",
    "following what was found by @xcite , we can then take the shmf to have the form of a schechter function :    @xmath25    @xmath26- \\gamma[2-\\alpha , m_{cut}(m)/\\beta m ] ) }   \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath27 gives the low mass slope and @xmath28 represents an additional cutoff mass .",
    "typical values for the low mass slope @xmath27 are around @xmath29 @xcite , although @xcite have found a less steep @xmath30 when fitting a power law and an even flatter @xmath31 when fitting to a schechter function of the form of equation ( [ shmf ] ) .",
    "we should also point out that @xcite obtain a slope which varies slightly with parent halo mass .",
    "the cutoff value has alternatively been determined as @xmath32 from semi - analytical models @xcite , or @xmath33 from simulations @xcite . to this expression",
    "should be added the cutoff we are implicitly considering at @xmath24 , as expressed in equation ( [ fractiondef ] ) .",
    "the first term on the right hand side guarantees that the mass fraction in subhaloes is @xmath34 . from this",
    "we see that @xmath24 has essentially an effect on the normalization of the shmf .",
    "however , as discussed above , what we really require to build the non - parametric model is the original subhalo mass function instead . to do this",
    ", we apply the mass loss factor presented in the previous section to the shmf of equation ( [ shmf ] ) , that is , we use @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the mass loss function , renormalizing as appropriate to guarantee that the original total mass in subhaloes equals the present mass of the parent halo . in terms of the original mass @xmath37 , the shmf of equation [ shmf ] then becomes     @xmath38f(m , m)\\times \\nonumber \\\\   & & { } \\times \\big(1-\\frac{d{\\rm log}f(m , m)}{d{\\rm log}m}\\big)dm_0 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the mass loss factor , with @xmath19 the present subhalo ( i.e. , the function plotted in figure [ massloss ] ) ; we have also explicitly included the transform of the differential term @xmath40 .",
    "once more , we are implicitly assuming a cutoff at an original subhalo mass of @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ shmffig ] shows different shmfs calculated using this scheme .     and",
    "@xmath15 . for comparison",
    ", we also show the original shmf for a @xmath42 halo when we take a flat mass loss factor , instead of one based on the curves of figure [ massloss ] , and a present , evolved shmf with a subhalo mass fraction of @xmath43.,height=317 ]    there are some important conclusions to be drawn from figure [ shmffig ] .",
    "first , unlike the case with the present shmfs , the original ones are almost universal when plotted as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that we are putting in what is , in these units , a universal normalization at the total halo mass @xmath11 and also a universal cutoff at @xmath45 , which usually dominates over the one in equation ( [ shmf ] ) , after transforming to the original mass . as a direct consequence of this",
    ", we can see that the original shmf , as calculated through this method , is essentially independent of the present subhalo mass fraction @xmath46 and largely independent of the cutoff given by the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "it is also largely insensitive to the shape of the mass loss factor as determined in the previous section .",
    "however , it should be cautioned that this depends on the actual mass loss factor @xmath47 used : this is only true if it is fairly regular , or more precisely @xmath48 , as is mostly the case of the function we are using presently , which mostly causes a rescalling of the subhalo mass function , without much altering its shape . in such a case , in fact , the only parameter of the present shmf which has a large effect is the low mass slope @xmath27 .",
    "this indicates that it should be mostly correct , in the context of building a non - parametric model like we are doing here , to use as the original shmf a power law of slope @xmath27 , with a cutoff at @xmath45 and the whole normalized so that the total original mass in subhaloes equals the present parent halo mass . from this , it is important to retain that , accepting these two conventions we are using on the normalization and cutoff , the only element of the shmf to which our model is sensitive is the low mass slope .",
    "for the subsequent calculations , we will use a model with the mass loss factor calculated in the previous section , a present shmf given by equation ( [ shmf ] ) with @xmath49 and @xmath33 . as mentioned above , the actual value of the mass fraction @xmath46 is not important since we have to renormalize the original mass function we obtain ; it is only factored if we wish to have the appropriately normalized mass loss factor @xmath36 to convert between original and present subhalo mass using @xmath35 .",
    "hereinafter , unless otherwise stated , all subhalo masses refer to the original mass .",
    "in this section we present our base model . we take a flat cosmology with parameters @xmath50 , @xmath9 and @xmath51 . while these do not exactly correspond to the current standard model @xcite , they are within the allowed range of the @xmath52 plane determined from the joint wmap - sdss study of @xcite , and we find they produce results better matching observations ( see section [ seccosm ] below ) than do models with slightly higher @xmath53 . on the other hand , they match very well with the results found from an analysis of cmb and 2df power spectrum by @xcite , being near the center of their @xmath52 concordance region ( see figure [ cosm ] ) . for the basic model ,",
    "we use the luminosity function in the k - band as determined from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "using the k - band allows us to avoid possible complications and discrepancies arising from brief intervals of active star formation , and therefore helps present a clearer picture .",
    "we use here a single waveband for clarity in the construction of the model ; a comparison of results for different wavebands using different luminosity functions is presented in section [ seclf ] .     plane . shown",
    "are the 1- and @xmath54 countours from the cmb+2df power spectrum results of @xcite , together with the @xmath54 concordance region from the wmap+sdss results of @xcite . also shown as an example of weak lensing results",
    "are the constraints of @xcite .",
    "the point marks the parameter values chosen for our basic model.,width=317 ]      the first step to building the non - parametric model is to combine the above subhalo mass function with the parent halo distribution in the form of the halo mass function to obtain the global distribution of the dark matter hosts of galaxies .",
    "this is also the step where the cosmological parameter dependency is factored in , by determining the form of the mass function .",
    "we will use the sheth - tormen mass function @xcite , given by :    @xmath55    with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; as usual , @xmath60 is the variance on the mass scale @xmath11 , @xmath61 is the growth factor , and @xmath62 is the linear threshold for spherical collapse , which in the case of a flat universe is @xmath63 . this mass function can be roughly approximated by a power law at low mass , scaling as @xmath64 , and an exponential cutoff at high mass of the form @xmath65 , where the cutoff mass is defined by @xmath66 and we have roughly @xmath67 . the total distribution of dark matter hosts is then given by combining this with the global distribution of subhaloes , which can be calculated from the shmf ( [ shmf ] ) and the halo mass function ( [ stmf ] ) by    @xmath68    these mass functions are shown in figure [ mffig ] .",
    "note that in the combined distribution of haloes / subhaloes the former dominate with subhaloes approaching parity only on mass scales below @xmath42 .",
    "the galaxy distribution is accounted for by the galaxy luminosity function , which we assume takes the shape of a schechter function @xcite :    @xmath69    for this base model , we use the k - band results from the 2mass survey , with parameters given by @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite ( see also table 1 ) . in section [ seclf ]",
    "below , we analyse the result of using luminosity functions in other wavebands .",
    "this fit applies to the magnitude range @xmath73 . an important point to note",
    "is that we will assume that the fit actually holds outside of this limited range , and extrapolate its result outside of it as necessary .",
    "this raises the question of how good a description of the real luminosity function a schechter function is and , in particular , whether a power law is a good fit to the faint end .",
    "observations at the faint end are plagued by a host of natural difficulties , most of all the need to sample efficiently low luminosity and low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "it is not yet entirely certain whether the luminosity function at the faint end can be well fit by the power law in the schechter function over a wide range ( see for example @xcite ; see also @xcite , who look at faint galaxies in sdss and find that a schechter function is a poor fit , and need to introduce a double rather than single power law parametrization at the faint end ) . for",
    "now , we will simply assume that we can extend the measured faint - end slope of the 2mass survey to fainter magnitudes than their stated limit .",
    "we can now combine the total dark matter host distribution with the galaxy distribution to get a relation between halo / subhalo mass and galaxy luminosity , by matching counts as described above in section 2 .",
    "the resulting relation is shown in figure [ mlfig ] .",
    "also shown are observational data for brightest cluster galaxy luminosity and cluster luminosity versus cluster mass , taken from the k - band results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies use x - ray temperature results to determine the cluster mass together with luminosities taken from the 2mass survey ; we include a correction to the halo mass to account for a virial overdensity of 100 times the critical density ( e.g. , @xcite ) , instead of 200 , based on taking an nfw halo with a concentration of 5 as was done in @xcite ( see further discussion in section [ secmobs ] ) . the points at the low - end come from milky way dwarf spheroidal satellites , where the mass was estimated from results of @xcite ( see also discussion in paper i ) and the luminosity comes from the b - band results of @xcite , then using an average @xmath74 to convert to the k - band @xcite .",
    "the intermediate mass results come from an analysis of sdss weak lensing results in @xcite and @xcite ; in both of these , we have transformed the z - band luminosity to k - band by using @xmath75 , with an average @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "for all these cases , we again converted to @xmath77 , using for the concentration the @xcite model .",
    "we find that the mass luminosity relation we obtain ( figure [ mlfig ] ) can be well approximated by a double power law of the type :    @xmath78    with the parameters @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "this fit is good to within @xmath84 in the range @xmath85 .",
    "the most important fact to retain from this fit is that luminosity scales as @xmath86 at high mass .",
    "the high values obtained for the exponents @xmath87 and @xmath88 are an artifact of the fact that the relation is steepening as the mass decreases ( note the value of the break mass given by @xmath89 ) .",
    "group luminosity scales as @xmath90 for high halo mass .",
    "overall , these parameters look different from the fit to observed data done using the same functional form as equation ( [ fit ] ) by @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the difference is the corrections we put in for the mass estimates . also , as noted , care should be taken with the low mass slope , since the values for the best fit curve depend on the lowest mass used for the fit .",
    "it is , however , easy to predict this slope : if the mass function goes as @xmath91 ( where this represents the total for haloes plus subhaloes ) and the luminosity function as @xmath92 , then the luminosity will scale as @xmath93 , with @xmath94 . with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we get @xmath97 .    overall , these results seem a good match to the observations .",
    "the quality of this match has improved over the results we presented in paper i , especially for the group / cluster luminosity . as we had hinted in the discussion in paper i ,",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that we now have a better , more self consistent , way of treating the subhalo mass fraction and mass loss .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , since we obtain a total luminosity which scales almost linearly with mass , we naturally obtain a mass to light ratio on cluster scales that is almost constant ; this is intrinsic to the model , and is in good agreement with observations ( see section [ secmlratio ] below ) .",
    "it is also worth to point out that the agreement for the group luminosity is not trivial : only the halo / subhalo mass - galaxy luminosity relation is constructed directly from the model . the group luminosity is obtained by assuming that applying this derived galaxy luminosity to the system of the haloes and their subhaloes will result in a good match for the corresponding galaxy systems .",
    "the agreement we obtain seems to point out that this is indeed a valid assumption ( but see @xcite for some potential problems involving the detailed luminosity functions for individual groups when following this prescription ) .",
    "there is some discrepancy between our results and the results for the higher mass bins based on weak lensing of sdss galaxies ( the points from @xcite ) . while there is no straightforward way to explain the differences we find",
    ", we caution that there are several factors that , when taken together , may be enough to account for them .",
    "most relevant of these are the fact that we are using an average colour to change the luminosities from the z- to the k - band , and the possibility that the mass being accounted for does not correspond exactly to the definition we are using .",
    "intriguingly , these weak lensing results seem to be a good match to our curve for the total luminosity , which raises the additional possibility that the observed luminosity includes not only the central lensing galaxy , but also some close , faint , satellites ( since we would expect that most substructure in these medium mass parents to be relatively small ) .",
    "[ lfparam ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section , we look at how our base result for the mass luminosity relation changes depending on the luminosity function ( and consequently waveband ) we use as a starting point .",
    "we use a variety of published luminosity functions , listed in table 1 , ranging from the blue to the infrared , and repeat the analysis of the previous section for each of these .",
    "the results for the galaxy and total luminosity are shown in figure [ mlcompfig ] , where the luminosity is plotted in units of the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 of each of the luminosity functions .",
    "of the luminosity function used.,title=\"fig:\",height=317 ]   of the luminosity function used.,title=\"fig:\",height=317 ]    the most striking feature of these results is that galaxy luminosity in high mass haloes is almost independent of the luminosity function used , with only very slight differences due to different normalization and faint end slope .",
    "technically , this is a consequence of the fact that all luminosity functions considered have a bright end cutoff of the form @xmath98 . in general",
    ", galaxies have an observed colour - magnitude relation which should be reflected in a different mass - luminosity relation at different wavebands ( as is the case here for lower mass ) . in this particular case , however , almost all the galaxies for these high mass haloes will be brightest cluster galaxies , for which an almost flat colour - luminosity relation is expected ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in agreement with the model results .",
    "the scaling at this high - mass end goes as @xmath86 .",
    "this is similar to that obtained in other studies using the conditional luminosity function formalism , like @xcite , who find that the central galaxy luminosity scales as @xmath99 for high halo mass , while the total luminosity of the galaxies in the halo scales as @xmath100 in the k - band ; using 2df results , @xcite also find that the luminosity of the central galaxy scales as @xmath101 .",
    "a fit to the observational k - band data gives @xmath102 @xcite .    for low mass haloes and subhaloes ,",
    "there are large differences between the results obtained by using the different luminosity functions .",
    "these are mostly a product of the characteristic luminosity , which determines where the break in the mass luminosity relation occurs , and the faint end slope , which determines the slope in the relation for low mass .",
    "these results illustrate the importance of an accurate determination of the faint end slope to obtaining a good mass luminosity relation . nonetheless , looking at the results for the group luminosity it is possible to see that these differences have only a small effect when calculating the total luminosity associated with a high mass halo .",
    "the different results are quite close , particularly in terms of scaling , if less so than in the individual galaxy case , and the differences seem mostly due to the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 .",
    "there is in fact some observational evidence that the scaling of cluster luminosity with mass is independent of photometric band ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . since the brightest galaxy luminosity gives a small relative contribution for high mass systems ( cf figure [ mlfig ] ) , it is possible to conclude that the main contribution to the luminosity should come from relatively massive subhaloes with luminosities roughly above @xmath103 , below which the differences due to the low end slope become quite significant , mostly due to different faint end slopes in the luminosity functions .",
    "more importantly , this means that the mass - total luminosity relation obtained by the non - parametric model depends mostly on the more well determined of the luminosity function parameters , @xmath0 .      although the agreement between our results and the large observational data set of brightest cluster galaxy luminosities and halo masses shown in figure [ mlfig ] was fairly good , it is possible to see that our model tends to slightly underpredict the expected luminosities . at such high masses ,",
    "the subhalo contribution to the total host number and therefore to the mass - luminosity relation is neglegible ( see figure [ mffig ] ) , and , as we have shown in the previous section , the results are also largely independent of the luminosity function . therefore , the relation between halo mass and hosted brightest galaxy luminosity depends essentially on the halo mass function , and through it on the cosmology considered .",
    "this makes it important to look at the background cosmology used and how it affects the results .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure [ mlcosm ] , where we also show the observational data for comparison .",
    "in general , it is possible to conclude that , comparing with the observations , our model tends to prefer lower values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the technical reason for this is quite straightfoward : lower values result in fewer high mass haloes , which means that when comparing to observed galaxy numbers it results in higher luminosity galaxies being associated with the same halo mass . for this reason ,",
    "we have adopted in our calculations a cosmological model with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , rather than the more standard @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this combination of values lies roughly on the lower edge of the concordance region from wmap+sdss measurements of @xcite , and near the center of that from cmb+2df @xcite ( see figure [ cosm ] ) .    , @xmath9 and @xmath104 , @xmath105",
    ". , title=\"fig:\",height=317 ] , @xmath9 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=317 ]    in fact , it is possible to obtain an even better agreement with the plotted observational values if we lower @xmath7 further .",
    "there are two main reasons for not adopting such a model : first , the @xcite results represent the best current measured estimate for the combination of the two ; second , and more importantly , there are further additional sources of error which are probably more significant than what is now a very accurate determination of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the first of these is the possibility that the main assumptions of the model are wrong .",
    "mainly , that is that we can not treat the mass luminosity relation as one - to - one and monotonic .",
    "while this is certainly true in specific cases and we expect there to be significant scatter about the relation , it seems a fair assumption to make for the average relation as we are determining here ; going beyond this assumption is outside the scope of this model .",
    "second , and more importantly in the context of the present paper , there is the possibility that the model is giving incorrect results simply because the number functions we are using as a basis for the comparison are mismatched , that is @xmath106 , where the observational term applies to the data points we are comparing our results with . since the method is based on counting numbers for each of these , a difference between them would cause it to give incorrect results when comparing to observations . as we discussed above",
    ", the cosmological model used can change the model part of the equation .",
    "far more likely , though , is that we are using an incorrect estimate for the observed mass that is skewing the observed term .",
    "we discuss this issue further in the next section .",
    "it is also worthwhile noting that , once the cosmology is fixed , the main determinant for the form of the halo mass - total luminosity relation is the slope of the subhalo mass function .",
    "this assumes that its normalization and cutoff are predefined , as discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "figure [ mlshmf ] shows the result of varying this slope .",
    "generally , a flatter slope for the subhalo mass function results in a flatter slope at high halo mass for the total luminosity as well .",
    "since a fit to the observational data gives a slope of 0.72 , while we obtain 0.88 , using a flatter slope for the subhalo mass function than 1.9 ( quite possible in light of simulation results ; see @xcite ) would likely give a better agreement with observations , depending on possible corrections to their mass estimates , which may not be uniform .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this in fact applies to the original subhalo mass function slope . how it compares with the present slope depends on the mass loss factor . with the one we are using in this paper , the slopes are mostly equal ( see section 3 ) .",
    ", between @xmath31 and @xmath49 ( our base model).,height=317 ]      as noted , one of the possibilities that may explain the difference between our model results and the set of observational cluster data as presented in figure [ mlfig ] is a potential misestimation of the corresponding halo mass .",
    "first of all , there is the problem of how to extrapolate to the virial mass . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors determine @xmath107 , the mass enclosed in a radius where the average density is 500 the critical , from x - ray temperature measurements .",
    "besides the actual observational error in the temperature , and possible errors in the @xmath108 relation used ( which are assumed to be accounted for in the observational error bars ) , there is the problem of how to extrapolate @xmath107 to the halo virial mass .",
    "following what is done by @xcite , we assume an nfw halo with a concentration of 5 to calculate the virial mass , except that we take the virial radius to be at @xmath109 rather than @xmath110 . a different density profile or simply concentration would result in a different measure for mass . changing the concentration to a value in the range of between 4 and 7 , for example , could result in as much as a 10% shift upwards or downwards in the estimated mass .",
    "range from the fit . also shown is the curve for the @xmath104 , @xmath105 halo mass function , for comparison.,height=317 ]    the non - parametric model can not work if the halo mass fucntion for the assumed cosmology does not match observations , but there is a relatively straightforward way of checking how well these mass estimates agree with the results from our model . as mentioned previously ,",
    "that is to check whether the predicted galaxy number at a given halo mass from the observed values match the number in the model , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 in the high mass range we are interested in here is given by the halo mass function .",
    "as noted , these two must match if the comparison between the model and the data is to be meaningful , since the model is based on counting numbers . in order to determine @xmath113 ,",
    "we combine the luminosity function with the fit to the observed halo mass - brightest cluster galaxy luminosity relation from @xcite .",
    "the resulting mass function , together with the possible range obtained from the errors in the fit parameters , is shown in figure [ mfobs ] . from this",
    "we can see that , while the halo mass function we are using does not quite match the mass function corresponding to the observations , it is well within the range allowed by the fit errors .",
    "if we assume that the results from the model are essentially correct , we can then use these curves to calculate a further correction to the estimated mass .",
    "in fact , this corresponds to finding the transformation that matches the fit to the observed data to our result for the average mass - luminosity relation .",
    "in this section we calculate an additional four results which can be derived directly from our non - parametric model , and which can be used as an additional check on the success of the model : the mass to light ratio , the occupation number , the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function .",
    "the discussed trends of the mass - luminosity relation are further visible in figure [ mlratiofig ] , which shows the @xmath114-band mass to light ratio of the entire system ( that is , a group or cluster if massive enough ; this is basically a different way of plotting the result of figure [ mlfig ] ) .",
    "-band light ratio of galaxy systems ( from isolated galaxies , to groups and clusters with growing mass ) .",
    "data points are taken from the corrected mass to light ratio calculated for the 2pigg catalogue of the 2df survey by @xcite .",
    "these include both the directly measured values for luminosities above @xmath115 , and the values inferred by comparing the derived group luminosity function with a theoretical mass function , for luminosities below this threshold .",
    "the latter were extracted from the shaded region in figure 15 of @xcite , where the point represents the value of their model curve at that luminosity .",
    "the errorbars include uncertainties related to different possible values of @xmath7 . for comparison",
    ", we also show a line for the result of model d of @xcite.,height=317 ]    as mentioned above , at the high mass end the cluster luminosity is almost directly proportional to halo mass ( roughly , @xmath116 ) .",
    "this means that the resulting mass to light ratio will be almost constant , as can be seen in the figure , rising only very slowly with halo mass , which matches well with previous results for the mass to light ratio of clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case , though , the values we obtain for the mass to light ratio seem to be slightly smaller than the observational results at the bright end , otherwise they seem in good agreement .",
    "this is reflected in the values for the cluster mass to light ratio .",
    "the value derived by @xcite is @xmath117 , while @xcite obtain an average value of @xmath118 ; we obtain a slightly lower cluster mass to light ratio of approximately @xmath119 for a @xmath120 halo .",
    "since we obtained a good agreement with the cluster luminosity results of @xcite and , as discussed above , the mass luminosity for single galaxies is well constrained in our model , the most likely origin for the discrepancy we find here is likely to be the subhalo distribution .",
    "lowering the value of the subhalo mass function slope slightly results in a better agreement with the observational results at both the low and high luminosity ends ; however , the agreement is poorer at intermediate luminosities , while the slope of the derived mass to light ratio becomes steeper ( cf .",
    "results in figure [ mlshmf ] ) .",
    "we can also compare our results with the conditional luminosity function of @xcite .",
    "plotted in figure [ mlratiofig ] is the result of the average halo mass to light ratio fit with the parameters of model d of @xcite .",
    "there is a good agreement at the low end , while again we find some disagreement at the high end .",
    "note that this disagreement is most likely due to the fact that we are adopting a different cosmology than these authors , with slightly lower values for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , the overall shape is quite similar ; the small difference is most likely due to the factor that these authors are fitting the mass to light ratio to a double power law , with a sharp transition to a constant at high mass , while we obtain a smooth function .",
    "the minimum also occurs at a slightly higher luminosity .",
    "we are actually in better agreement with the observed values at an intermediate range ( around @xmath121 ) , while the opposite happens at the bright end . between both results",
    "is considerably better ; as noted , using a flatter slope for the subhalo mass function may help with the problem .",
    "figure [ mlratiofig ] also illustrates quite well the various mass ( or , as presented in the figure , luminosity ) scales which determine galaxy properties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . there is a minimum in the mass to light ratio at a mass scale of around @xmath122 .",
    "this is a good match for the scale which represents a shift in the characteristic galaxy population corresponding to a change in the sources of gas accretion and star formation suppression ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , as we have already shown , the steep slope in the mass luminosity relation means that haloes below roughly a few times @xmath123 will essentially be dark ; again , this matches well with the mass below which photo - ionization is expected to suppress gas infall @xcite . at the high end , there is a noticeable break in the mass to light ratio at a corresponding mass of around @xmath124 . as can be seen in figure [ mlfig ] , this marks the scale where we go over from isolated galaxies with at most very small satellites to actual groups , and once more is in good agreement with what is observed and expected from a theoretical point of view , which predicts an upper bound for cooling in a dynamical time at this mass scale .",
    "this is also the mass scale at which merging is expected to become inefficient ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      with the subhalo mass function given by equation ( [ shmf ] ) , it is straightfoward to calculate the occupation number ( that is , the number of subhaloes in a parent halo of given mass ) , as a function of halo mass @xmath11",
    "this is simply given by :    @xmath125    the only complication is that it is necessary to specify a minimum mass for the subhaloes , @xmath126 ; otherwise , the integral is divergent .",
    "since we equate subhaloes with satellite galaxies , we can associate this minimum mass with a minimum luminosity of these galaxies , and then @xmath127 will give us the total number of galaxies in a halo of mass @xmath11 , with luminosity greater than the minimum we are considering ; this is one of the key ingredients of the hod models , ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these models usually take the function in ( [ occup ] ) to be the average value of the number of satellite galaxies , with the actual number a poisson distribution around this average ; this seems to be in good agreement with simulation results @xcite . also , the occupation number of the central galaxy is usually taken to be a step function , being 0 or 1 depending on whether the halo mass is greater than a certain minimum ; the case in our model is also similar , as we consider that a halo hosts a galaxy with luminosity above a certain threshold if its mass is greater than that corresponding to this luminosity from the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "our results for the occupation number are shown in figure [ occupfig ] , where we take the minimum mass to be the necessary to host a galaxy with @xmath128 .",
    "the points plotted are taken from the cluster data of @xcite , where as before we have included a correction to the mass .    , given by the sum of the number of subhaloes with galaxies above a given luminosity plus one for the central galaxy .",
    "the luminosity threshold adopted was @xmath129 , which corresponds to the minimum used for the observed data points plotted , taken from @xcite.,height=317 ]    our result is in quite good agreement with the plotted data . at high halo mass ( approximately above @xmath130 ) , our result for the occupation number scales roughly as @xmath131 .",
    "qualitatively , it also compares well with those obtained from simulations , analytical models and observations by a variety of authors .",
    "the first thing to note is that , unlike the result in paper i , the occupation number is now no longer a function of @xmath132 alone : there is an extra dependence on the halo mass @xmath11 .",
    "physically , this is understandable as haloes having @xmath133 are in the process of growing and merging whereas those having @xmath134 are decreasing in number density as they merge into larger systems .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the the subhalo mass function , given in equation ( [ shmf ] ) , can not be written as a function of solely @xmath44 : its normalization has terms which depend only on @xmath11 . while a direct comparison of the numbers is complicated by the fact that they depend on what mass threshold",
    "is being considered , the slope of the occupation number for high mass haloes is roughly the same as that found in other studies .",
    "this matches well with the analytically derived halo mass function of @xcite , who find a slope of 0.9 at high @xmath135 , and closer to 1 at lower @xmath136 , and also with the results from simulations : for example , @xcite find a slope very close to 1 , while @xcite , in fitting hod models to semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations , find values for the slope between 0.97 and 1.24 ( depending on the baryonic mass threshold ) .",
    "results of observational studies also seem to agree on a slope of about 1 : @xcite obtain a relation for the number of galaxies with @xmath137 scaling as @xmath138 , while @xcite fit a hod model , together with the cosmological parameters , to the projected correlation function of a volume limited subsample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , together with cmb results , and find a good agreement with models where the slope is fixed at a value of 1 ; when they leave this as a free parameter , they obtain a result of 0.8 , but without a significant improvement in the quality of the fit .      also of interest",
    "when studying clusters is the group luminosity function , @xmath139 . this is the analogous of the galaxy luminosity function , but is calculated for groups and clusters , and gives the number density of these objects in a given luminosity range .",
    "we can obtain this in our model by transforming the mass dependent halo mass function by using the relation between halo mass and total group luminosity :    @xmath140    here , we are implicitly assuming that a group / cluster is made up of two components : a central galaxy hosted in the parent halo itself , and its satellites , hosted by the subhaloes .",
    "thus the total luminosity is the sum of these two contributions :    @xmath141    this group luminosity is the same as was presented in figure [ mlfig ] above .",
    "our result for the group luminosity function is shown in figure [ grouplumfig ] .",
    "the determination of the observational function is usually done from galaxy catalogues by building groups of gravitationally bound galaxies . in the figure",
    ", we show the luminosity function fits of two different such functions : the ags for the cfa survey @xcite and the vslf @xcite group luminosity functions .",
    "we also show data for the group luminosity function as measured from 2df results of @xcite .",
    "we have included corrections to the ags results by using @xmath142 and making the vslf results 0.55 magnitudes fainter to compensate for the difference between the @xmath143 and @xmath144 bands and internal absorption ( see comments in @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain a very good agreement with the observational results .",
    "this agreement is markedly better than the result in paper i ; this is essentially a result of the higher group luminosity we obtain for each halo , which in turn is caused by an increase in the subhalo numbers at a given luminosity due to the more self - consistent way in which we are treating mass loss .    ) ; the two other lines are observational group luminosity functions extracted from galaxy catalogues , respectively the ags @xcite ( dotted ) and the vslf @xcite ( dashed).,height=317 ]      it is also possible to derive the multiplicity function , the number density of group / clusters as a function of their richness , by a process similar to the one described above for the group luminosity function .",
    "to do this , we replace the group luminosity @xmath145 in equation ( [ grouplf ] ) with the number of galaxies present in the halo .",
    "this is given by the total occupation number calculated above and shown in figure [ occupfig ] , that is , the number of luminous subhaloes plus one .",
    "the only other thing that is necessary to take into account is the limit to the galaxy luminosity we want to consider .",
    "this will then give a lower limit to the mass of the haloes and their subhaloes to put into the occupation number calculation .",
    "our results for the multiplicity function are shown in figure [ multfig ] .",
    "we have taken as the lower luminosity limit @xmath146 , in order to match the observational results also shown . due to the way in which it is built",
    ", there is a sharp upturn at @xmath147 due to the haloes which are massive enough to contain a galaxy but not to have subhaloes big enough to host a galaxy themselves .",
    "this is in part a consequence of modelling the occupation number of the parent halo as a step function , as was done above ; a more realistic model would have a smoother transtition ( see e.g. @xcite for an example of how this is done in the context of hod models ) , which would help to atenuate this .    .",
    "the different points are taken from the results derived by @xcite from the cfa survey , while the two additional lines are estimates based on the group luminosity functions shown in figure [ grouplumfig ] , where the magnitude limit for all of these is also @xmath146.,height=317 ]    figure [ multfig ] also shows some observational data .",
    "the points were taken from the analysis of @xcite , while the two lines were constructed from the two group luminosity functions shown in figure [ grouplumfig ] . to do this ,",
    "we assume that the luminosity function of the galaxies in each group has the same shape as the general galaxy luminosity function of the survey , a schechter function with characteristic luminosity @xmath0 and faint end slope @xmath27 , but with the normalization @xmath148 determined by the group luminosity . by integrating this function , the group luminosity @xmath145",
    "can then be calculated as @xmath149 ; this is then related to the number of galaxies in the group above a certain threshold luminosity @xmath150 by    @xmath151    where we used the expression above to replace @xmath148 .",
    "finally we can use this relation between group luminosity and member numbers in the group luminosity function to obtain the multiplicity function , using @xmath152 , where @xmath153 and @xmath139 are the multiplicity and group luminosity functions , respectively .",
    "the galaxy numbers for both the points and the results derived from the group luminosity functions were then multiplied by a factor of 0.66 to take into account the difference in radius between friends of friends estimates and the usual definition of virial radius ( see @xcite ) .    we obtain a good agreement with the observational points , better than was the case in paper i. this is not surprising given the results we presented above for the group luminosity function , and the root cause is the same : the more self - consistent treatment of mass loss has resulted in an increase in subhalo numbers at a given mass . on the other hand , at high member count , our result would seem to be above the multiplicity functions calculated from the group luminosity function .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that we assumed above that we can use for the luminosity function of the group galaxies the same shape as the background luminosity function ; while this should be true for moderately dense regions ( corresponding to low @xmath154 ) , it is not a very good approximation for very dense environments like clusters , where @xmath154 is high ( see @xcite for observational results ) .",
    "in fact , a higher @xmath0 , expected in clusters with high @xmath154 , gives a higher value for the multiplicity function , therefore bringing the two curves into better agreement with our results .",
    "in this paper we have presented a non - parametric model to relate the luminosity of a galaxy to the mass of the halo or subhalo hosting it .",
    "we start by assuming that this relation is one to one and monotonic , and then compare their number as given by their statistical distributions , obtained from observations and simulations , respectively .",
    "this gives us the average relation between the luminosity of a galaxy and the mass of the dark matter halo or subhalo which hosts it .",
    "we can also determine the total group luminosity as a function of halo mass by integrating over the luminosity of all the subhaloes in a given parent .",
    "we have argued that , to maintain the assumption of monotonicity , when accounting for the subhaloes it is in fact necessary to consider not their present mass , but rather their original mass just prior to accretion into their parent halo . in order to allow for this ,",
    "we have introduced a simplified prescription for the average mass loss factor that we can then apply to subhalo mass functions measured from simulations to regain the original subhalo mass function .",
    "we have noted that , however , there are two strong constraints on this function : first , no subhalo could originally have more than half the present mass of the parent halo , otherwise it would be , by definition , the parent halo itself ; second , it is to be expected that , since the parent is built up by accreting and stripping mass off the subhaloes , that the total mass in the original subhaloes equals the present mass of the parent halo . if the mass loss factor is fairly regular ( or more precisely , its logarithmic derivative is always significantly lower than 1 , which is mostly the case with the one we presented ) , and assuming a present day schechter type subhalo mass function ( which seems to be obtained from simulation results ; see e.g. , @xcite ) , these two constraints mean that the only free parameter in the original subhalo mass function would be the low mass slope , which in these circumstances would be close to the present day one .",
    "we find that , for high mass haloes , the mass - luminosity relation appears to be mostly independent of the luminosity function being used , when the luminosity is scaled to the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 .",
    "the same is true , to a rather lesser extent , of the mass - group luminosity relation , which has an increased dependence on @xmath0 . at the low mass end ,",
    "the break in the relation is associated with @xmath0 , while the slope depends significantly on the faint end slope of the luminosity function .",
    "overall , our results are a good match to observations and results of other theoretical models .",
    "we find , however , that for high mass haloes , our results seem to slightly underestimate the luminosity of both central galaxies and clusters when compared to the observational results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this small discrepancy between our results and observational data simultaneously raises some concern .",
    "the reason is that , as we have discussed , the mass luminosity relation in high mass haloes is practically independent of both the actual luminosity function used and of the subhalo population .",
    "this means that our result depends only on the halo mass function , and through it , on the cosmological model .",
    "we have shown that , when comparing our results with observations , our model seems to prefer lower values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; within the concordance region of @xcite , best results are obtained near the lower boundary , and consequently we have used @xmath8 and @xmath9 to construct our base model . while to change",
    "our result would necessitate changing the cosmology , or more seriously , the central assumptions underlying the model , it is far more likely that the discrepancy is actually a product of a misestimation of the observed halo mass .",
    "in fact , there is some uncertainty regarding the values of the mass cited in these studies , specifically in extrapolating them to the virial radius . a reasonable change in the concentration used to make",
    "this extrapolation may account for as much as a 10% shift in the estimated observed mass .",
    "further , using the fit to the observed mass - luminosity data and the luminosity function , we have compared the expected number of galaxies in haloes of a given mass to the one we are using .",
    "we find that , while the agreement is not perfect , the mass function we used is well within the error range of the observed one .",
    "further , assuming that our model is correct , it is possible to view the required transformation to the estimated mass to match the two curves as an additional correction to it .",
    "the situation with the total luminosity on cluster scales is relatively similar , though here the problem might be more one of shape rather than normalization .",
    "the slight discrepancy between our results and the observational data may be improved if the halo mass has been underestimated observationally or by tweaking with the cosmological parameters .",
    "there is however an additional factor , in that the subhalo population contributes significantly to the total luminosity .",
    "this is represented by the original subhalo mass function , and we have argued that its normalization and cutoff mass should be considered fixed , the former to give the total present parent halo mass , the latter to avoid having subhaloes which originally had more than half the parent mass . if we assume that this function has a schechter shape ( as would be the case with a present subhalo mass function with a schechter shape and a regular mass loss factor ) , then the only free parameter left is the low mass slope .",
    "we have also argued , by comparing the results obtained using different luminosity functions , that the more important luminosity function parameter that determines the result at this high mass end is the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 , while the faint end slope ( which could be considered the most uncertain of the parameters ) does not seem to be as big a factor .",
    "therefore , if we take the subhalo mass - galaxy luminosity relation ( and consequently the cosmology ) to be fixed , the remaining free parameter in the model is the subhalo mass function low mass end slope .    on the one hand",
    ", this means that we can not much vary the total number of satellite galaxies in this framework . on the other hand , our result for the group luminosity seems to be a better match to the observed values than that of the galaxy luminosity ; if we were to increase the latter , we might end up obtaining too high a luminosity in groups , assuming the slope of the subhalo mass function is kept fixed .",
    "this potential problem may however be viewed in light of the recent results of @xcite , who claim that when using a similar prescription to model the satellite galaxy luminosity function using the subhalo mass function , it is necessary to introduce an efficiency function lowering the number of luminous subhaloes otherwise predicted to match the two .",
    "there is also the possibility , which we have not considered , that the mass - luminosity relation is different for haloes and subhaloes ; using a different relation for the latter might explain the difference to the observational results .",
    "since gas accretion and mergers stop in subhaloes once they are accreted , we are led to the conclusion that , if this were to be the case , the subhaloes would actually be less luminous than what we are considering .",
    "additionally , there is the effect of the slope of the subhalo mass function . using a flatter slope than the 1.9 value we have used for",
    "our base model may help with this situation , since it would flatten the slope of the group luminosity calculated without changing the high mass galaxy luminosity .",
    "this may be benificial , since the fit to the observed clusters from @xcite goes as @xmath155 , while we get a slightly steeper 0.88 .",
    "if we do accept the whole framework of the model , though , this raises an intriguing possibility : the only free parameter we have is the low mass end slope of the subhalo mass function , and so we may be able to get a completely independent confirmation of its value by fitting the model results to the observational data .",
    "quantitavely , we find that central galaxy luminosity scales with halo mass as @xmath2 for high mass haloes , fairly independently of waveband when the luminosity is scaled by the appropriate characteristic luminosity @xmath0 , and also of the form of the subhalo mass function . the total group luminosity scales with halo mass as @xmath1 , also fairly independently of waveband when appropriately scaled ; a flatter subhalo mass function low mass slope results in a flatter dependence at the high mass end .",
    "this implies that the halo mass - to - light ratio is almost flat at high mass ( and luminosity ) , and we obtain a value of @xmath156 for a @xmath157 halo . for low mass haloes ,",
    "the resulting mass luminosity relation is dependent on what waveband we are considering , but scaled luminosity goes as @xmath158 with @xmath87 roughly between 4 and 4.5 for haloes or subhaloes in the mass range @xmath159 to @xmath160 ; for example , in the k - band used for our base model , @xmath161 .",
    "we also find that the occupation number , which can be derived almost directly from the subhalo mass function , scales as @xmath162 .",
    "finally , we should also make a note on the applicability of the relation we obtained .",
    "first , we should stress that this is an average relation .",
    "as can be seen from the plotted observational data , we expect a rather large scatter around it . while we feel that obtaining this average relation is quite an important first step and by itself",
    "already allows a range of applications , it is important to obtain a model for the scatter if it is to be applied , for example , to build mock catalogues from simulation results . in this direction ,",
    "there has already been some work on applying the base framework that we have developed further here to a context of a conditional luminosity function , including potential prescriptions for scatter ( see work by cooray and collaborators , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , we feel it is relevant to have a good analysis of the basic framework , especially since the overall simplicity of the model makes it conceptually clear and pedagogical , while at the same time allowing a good comprehension of the factors influencing it .",

    "<S> non - parametric , empirically based , models for associating galaxy luminosities with halo / subhalo masses are being developed by several groups and we present here an updated version of the @xcite version of this model . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on a more accurate , self - consistent treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass function to address this question anew . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mass - luminosity relation , at high mass , particularly for first brightest galaxies and less so for group total , is almost independent of the actual luminosity function considered , when luminosity is scaled by the characteristic luminosity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the shape of the total luminosity depends on the slope of the subhalo mass function . for these high mass , cluster sized haloes </S>",
    "<S> we find that total luminosity scales as @xmath1 , while the luminosity of the first brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass , @xmath2 , in good agreement with observations and previous results . at low mass , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting slope of the mass luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the luminosity function , and we obtain a steep relation , with approximately @xmath3 for @xmath4 in the k - band . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of galaxies per halo / cluster is also in very good agreement with observations , scaling as @xmath5 .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of observational data . taking the model as essentially correct , we consider two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies : problems with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass determination . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , when comparing with observations and for a flat cosmology , the model tends to prefer lower values for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . within the wmap+sdss concordance plane of @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we find best agreement around @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; this is also in very good agreement with the results of the cmb+2df study of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also check on possible corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent number of haloes / clusters . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we include further checks on the model results based on the mass to light ratio , the occupation number , the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function .    </S>",
