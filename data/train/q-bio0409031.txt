    "the most fundamental way to account for the behaviour of a physical system is through its energy function @xmath0 , which depends on the coordinates @xmath1 and the momenta @xmath2 of all the particles . in normal situations ,",
    "this function can be expressed as the sum of the kinetic energy @xmath3 depends , in general , on the positions and the momenta . however",
    ", if cartesian coordinates are used , the dependence on positions vanishes . ] and the potential energy @xmath4 . since the former is of general form for any type of system and , normally , it does not affect the equilibrium properties , the latter is enough for a complete characterization of the problem .    under most real circumstances ,",
    "the exact form of @xmath5 is unknown and one is forced to seek an approximation @xmath6 .",
    "this may be done , for physical systems that are significantly complex , by assuming that the relevant interactions included in @xmath4 can be formally factorized @xcite . then",
    ", an approximated function @xmath7 is devised according to heuristic and semiempirical reasons to account for each of the original parts @xmath8 :    @xmath9    for example , in the study of proteins @xcite , which are a very relevant case of complex systems , some of the terms in which the total potential - energy function is traditionally factorized are the hydrogen - bonds energy , the van der waals interaction , the excluded - volume repulsion , the coulomb energy and the solvation energy .",
    "this last interaction , which is one of the most challenging terms of @xmath4 to model , is customarily further split into electrostatic and non - electrostatic parts @xcite .",
    "it is the former which is studied in section  [ sec : application ] to illustrate the application of the concepts herein discussed .",
    "returning to the general case , let us assume that a particular energy term @xmath10 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fact_ex ] and its approximated counterpart @xmath11 correspond to the part of @xmath4 that is going to be studied or modeled . let us denote that term @xmath12 by @xmath13 and , correspondly , @xmath11 by @xmath14 in the forecoming reasoning .",
    "clearly , if the approximated function @xmath15 is _ too distant _ from the original @xmath13 , it will be useless , as this difference will certainly propagate to the total potential energy .",
    "therefore , one must precisely define and calculate this _ distance _ , depending on the type of system which is the object of the study and on the particular aspects that are going to be investigated .",
    "the situation is further complicated when subsequent approximations to @xmath15 are done , usually with the aim of lessening the numerical complexity and rendering the simulations feasible .",
    "this yet - undefined distance between potential - energy functions may also be useful in another situation which is often found in the study of complex systems : parameter fitting .",
    "any reasonable functional form of a certain term @xmath13 of the total potential energy ( or of its approximation @xmath15 ) is a simplified model of physical reality and it contains a number of free parameters .",
    "these parameters , which , in most of the cases , are not physically observable , must be fit against experimental or more _ ab initio _ results prior to using the function for practical purposes .",
    "for example , in the continuum solvation models based on the solution of the poisson equation @xcite , typical free parameters are the dielectric constants and the position of the surface that separates the outer medium from the inner one . although they are customarily assigned _ standard _ values ( such as @xmath16 for the dielectric constant of the protein , @xmath17 for the dielectric constant of the aqueous medium in the field of molecular simulations",
    ", @xmath18 usually denotes the parameter , which quantifies the ionic strength in the aqueous medium ; @xmath19 is customarily used to represent the dielectric constant .",
    "however , in this work , the usual convention in physics , by which @xmath18 stands for the dielectric constant and @xmath19 stands for the dielectric permittivity , is preferred .",
    "since the ionic strength is zero in all calculations , this choice should not be misleading .",
    "] , and the molecular surface ( ms ) , defined by connolly @xcite , for the surface of separation ) , we believe that they must be fit in order to render calculations more accurate .",
    "certainly , for other potential - energy functions , such as the ones found in force fields like charmm @xcite , the fit of the free parameters is common practice .    in order for any fit to yield statistically significant values of the parameters , the particular region of the parameter space",
    "in which the final result lies must have the property of _ robustness _ , i.e. , it must occur that , if the found set of parameters values is slightly changed , then , the relevant characteristics of the potential - energy function which depends on them are also approximately kept unmodified .",
    "if this were not the case , a new fit , performed using a different set of experimental ( or more _ ab initio _ ) points , could produce a very _ distant _ potential .",
    "this last scenario is , clearly , undesirable .",
    "therefore , it may be useful to evaluate the robustness of the , _ a priori _ , reasonable regions of parameter space for the potential energy function that is to be used . to accomplish this",
    ", one must again define a relevant distance between two _ instances _ of the same potential with different values of the parameters .    in section  [ sec : distance ] , a meaningful distance that can be used in the two situations aforementioned is defined and justified . in section  [ sec : application ] , within the context of the protein folding problem and as an example of the first application discussed , this distance is measured between instances of the solvation energy arising from the choice of different grid sizes in the finite - differences algorithm with which it is calculated . to illustrate the second possible use of the distance , the robustness of the poisson energies to changes in some of its free parameters , holding the grid size fixed ,",
    "is quantified .",
    "this analysis is necessary to assess the significance of the parameters values determined through a fit .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "let @xmath13 be a particular term of the potential energy of a system .",
    "the numerical value of this physical quantity for each conformation @xmath20 depends on two conceptually different inputs : on one hand , the algorithm or approximation used to compute it , denoted by @xmath21 ; on the other hand , the values of the free parameters @xmath22 .",
    "changes in these inputs produce different _ instances _ of the physical quantity @xmath13 , which we denote by subscripting @xmath23 . for example , if the algorithm is held constant and two different set of parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are used , our notation made explicit would read as in the following equation ( an analogous definition may be made if the algorithm is held constant and the parameters are varied ) .",
    "@xmath26    now , a useful and physically meaningful definition of a distance @xmath27 is sought between a pair of instances , such as the ones in the previous equation , of the same potential - energy function .    in some cases traditionally studied in physics ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath23 on the parameters is simple enough to allow a closed functional dependence @xmath28 to be found for example , if the mass of a harmonic oscillator is changed from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , the potential energy functions will satisfy the linear relation for all the conformations of the system ; if the the atomic charges are rescaled by a factor @xmath31 ( being actually @xmath32 ) and @xmath31 is changed from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , the free energies of solvation calculated via the poisson equation will , in turn , satisfy the linear relation , etc . ] .",
    "however , in the study of complex systems , such as proteins , this dependence is often much more complicated , due to the high dimensionality of the conformational space and to the fact that the energy landscape lacks any evident symmetry .",
    "the set @xmath35 of the conformations with a particular value of the potential energy @xmath36 typically spans large regions of the phase space containing structurally different conformations . when an approximation is performed or the algorithm is changed , from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , or the free parameters are shifted , from @xmath39 to @xmath25 , each conformation @xmath20 in @xmath35 is affected in a different way and its new energy @xmath40 is modified in a manner that does not depend trivially on the particular region of the phase space which the conformation @xmath20 belongs to .",
    "therefore , a simple functional relation @xmath28 is no longer possible to be found : for each value of @xmath36 , there corresponds now a whole distribution of values of @xmath41 associated with conformations which share the same value of @xmath36 but which are far apart in the conformational space .",
    "moreover , the projection of this into the @xmath41 look as a random variable for each particular value of @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal_function_3d ] ) .",
    "we then define two real functions , @xmath28 and @xmath42 , which correspond to the mean and to the standard deviation , respectively , of this random variable as a function of @xmath36 ( where the average @xmath43 is defined to be taken over the conformations @xmath44 ) :    @xmath45    it can be proved , from their definition , that these two functions are continuous irrespectively of the particular characteristics of @xmath46 and @xmath40 ( given that both of them are _ smooth _ functions of the conformation ) .",
    "it may also be shown that , under assumptions which are typically fulfilled in real cases , @xmath28 and @xmath42 are also differentiable .",
    "thus , when restricted to a finite interval of @xmath36 , the linear dependence given by the following equation may hold approximately :    @xmath47    in fact , for the aforementioned cases in which the dependence of the potential energy on the parameters is simple enough ( see footnote [ foot : simple_p ] ) , eq .",
    "[ eq : linear ] holds exactly and , being able to describe @xmath28 by a closed analytical formula , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be exactly computed has been formally defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : mean_std ] as an average , in the case of the simple systems in footnote  [ foot : simple_p ] , a function @xmath28 may be found algebraically .",
    "this is , however , consistent .",
    "if one thinks that , in these systems , the spread @xmath42 is zero , the relation found algebraically and the one that stems from the average are identical . ] .",
    "however , in a general situation , the functions defined in eq .  [ eq : mean_std ] are impossible to be calculated analytically and so are the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the linear approximation of @xmath28 . in such a case ,",
    "one may at most have a finite collection of @xmath50 conformations @xmath51 and the respective values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for each one of them . these data , for a particular @xmath54 ,",
    "should be thought as a single _ numerical experiment _ in the already suggested sense that , if one regards @xmath55 as an independent variable , the _ outcome _ of the dependent variable @xmath53 is basically unpredictable and @xmath41 may be regarded as a random variable parametrically dependent on @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal_function_3d ] ) . from this finite knowledge about the system",
    ", one may statistically estimate the values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if the standard deviation @xmath42 is a constant ( i.e. , it does not depend on @xmath36 ) , which , for the particular system studied in this work , has been found to be approximately true , then , the least - squares maximum - likelihood method @xcite yields the best estimates for @xmath48 and @xmath49 the same letters are used for the ideal parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath56 and for their least - squares best estimates , since the only knowledge that one may have about the former comes from the calculation of the latter . ] under very general conditions , such as independence of the random variables and normal distribution .",
    "moreover , it may be shown @xcite that the best estimate for the standard deviation @xmath56 ( see footnote  [ foot : estimates ] ) is given by the following expresion :    @xmath57^{2}}{n-2 } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    this quantity @xmath56 may be regarded as a _",

    "systematic error _ and , since it is equivalent to an energy reference , its actual value is not relevant for the forecoming discussion .",
    "the slope @xmath48 and @xmath56 are the two quantities involved in the definition of the distance @xmath27 , which is the central concept introduced in this paper ( see eq .  [ eq : def_d ] below ) . in order to render this definition meaningful , we are going to evaluate how _ energy differences _ are modified , when going from @xmath36 to @xmath41 , as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath56 .",

    "now , let us focus on two arbitrary conformations of the system ( see the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : criterium ] ) . for them ,",
    "the difference @xmath58 is a random variable parametrically dependent on the difference @xmath59 ( which is assumed to be regular number , i.e. , a random variable with zero variance ) .",
    "the probability density of this random variable is found by assuming that @xmath41 is normally distributed with mean @xmath28 and standard deviation @xmath56 .",
    "then , the distribution of @xmath58 , for each @xmath59 , is normal with mean @xmath60 and standard deviation @xmath61",
    "if @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are random variables and the relation @xmath65 holds , then . if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are independent , one also has that @xcite . ] :    @xmath66 \\ , .\\ ] ]    if the random errors were negligible ( as in the systems discussed in footnote  [ foot : simple_p ] ) and one wanted to calculate the value of @xmath59 from the knowledge of @xmath58 , the identity would have to be used . when there are significant random errors , the situation is equivalent except for the fact that there is a probabilistic indetermination , i.e. , from the _ measured _ value of @xmath58 , @xmath59 can be no longer inferred .",

    "this definition encodes some intuitions that one may have about the _ loss of information _ involved in the transit from @xmath36 to @xmath41 .",
    "let us remark some important properties which illustrate this fact :    1 .",
    "if the slope @xmath48 is nonzero and the random error @xmath56 is zero , and there is no loss of information .",
    "an example of this situation is given by the simple systems in footnote  [ foot : simple_p ] : clearly , no loss of information may be involved in changing the mass of an harmonic oscillator .",
    "if the random error @xmath56 is different from zero and the slope @xmath48 goes to zero , and the loss of information is complete .",
    "one may picture this situation by making the best - fit line in fig .",
    "[ fig : criterium ] horizontal .",
    "in such a case , when two numerical experiments are performed , the probability distribution of measuring @xmath58 does not depend on @xmath59 ( it is normal with zero mean ) and the information about @xmath59 is impossible to recover .",
    "3 .   for intermediate cases in which both @xmath48 and @xmath56 are nonzero , all the information about @xmath67 is found in its probability - density function ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : pdf_dv2b ] ) and many probabilistic statements may be made .",
    "for example , it would be desirable that the sign of @xmath67 had a high probability of being equal to the sign of @xmath59 .",
    "this would typically keep the correct energy ordering of the conformations when going from @xmath36 to @xmath41 . making the variable change in eq .  [",
    "eq : pdf_dv2b ] , one finds that this probability is given by the following equation ( assuming , without loss of generality , that ) .",
    "+ @xmath71 \\mathrm{d}x \\ , .\\ ] ] + for a same value of @xmath59 , this probability decreases with @xmath72 ; if @xmath72 is held constant , it increases with @xmath59 ( the minimum being , either for or for ) . if @xmath72 is small , the probability of the ordering being mantained is large , even for pairs of conformations that are close in .",
    "for example , if one takes @xmath73 , it happens that , if , then , ; if , then , , etc .",
    "any other choice of @xmath31 would only yield different numerical values for this bounds on @xmath74 ; the qualitative facts would be preserved .",
    "however , since this values are natural ( the normal distribution varies rapidly and one would easily get very large or very small probabilities ) , the choice @xmath73 is considered to be the most convenient herein and it is the one to be used in section  [ sec : application ] .",
    "the properties stated in the previous point are direct consequences of the more general fact that , as @xmath72 decreases , so does the standard deviation of the random variable @xmath67 ( which equals @xmath75 ) and the distribution becomes sharper around the average @xmath59 ( see eq .  [ eq : pdf_dv2b ] ) .",
    "that is , the smaller the value of @xmath72 , the larger the probability of @xmath67 being close to the _ perfect _ value @xmath59 .",
    "this measure of the distance between two instances of a potential energy presents some advantages .",
    "on one hand , if the approximations on which it is based ( normal distribution of @xmath41 for each @xmath36 , linear @xmath28 dependence , constancy of @xmath42 and zero variance in the _ measures _ of @xmath36 ) are reasonable , the statistical statements derived from a particular @xmath72 value are meaningful and precise . on the other hand ,",
    "this statements refer , like the ones in the points discussed above , to the whole conformational space .",
    "however , we would like to stress that , in this work , we are not going to give any criterium to decide whether a particular value of @xmath72 is sufficiently small for an approximation to be valid or for the system to be robust to changes in the free parameters .",
    "such a decission must be taken depending on the particularities of the system studied ( which are encoded in the total potential energy function @xmath5 ) and on the questions sought to be answered .",
    "our definition of @xmath27 , being based in characteristics shared by many complex systems , is of general application .",
    "for example , we are not going to establish any limit on the accuracy required for a potential energy function to successfully predict the folding of proteins @xcite .",
    "we consider this question a difficult theoretical problem and we believe that it may be possible _ a priori _ that some special features of the energy landscapes of proteins ( such as shape ) are the main responsible of the high efficiency and cooperativity of the folding process @xcite . if this were the case , a different procedure for measuring the distance between potential energy functions could be devised @xcite , as any approximation which does not significantly alter these special features would be valid even if the value of @xmath72 is very large .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , it will be assumed , herein and in section  [ sec : application ] that a transit between instances of the same potential whose @xmath27 value is _ of the order _ of the thermal fluctuations @xmath76 is acceptable is a relevant energy ( @xmath76 is preferred to @xmath77 since per mole energy units are used in this article ) and the results will be presented in units of @xmath76 .",
    "it appears in the thermodynamical equilibrium boltzmann distribution , in which the probability @xmath78 of a conformation @xmath79 is proportional to @xmath80 , it also determines the transition probability @xmath81 $ ] in the metropolis monte carlo scheme and it is the spread of the stochastic term in the langevin equation @xcite . ] .",
    "the last point that we must remark in this section is that the distance introduced in this paper does not satisfy all the properties that the class of mathematical objects usually referred to as _ distances _ do satisfy .",
    "for example , the equivalence becomes , for the distance in eq .",
    "[ eq : def_d ] , an implication in only one direction , i.e. , while it is true that , the reciprocal is false in general , since , for example , if , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 non - zero constants , then @xmath84 when , clearly , the two instances are not equal .",
    "another property of the mathematical distances that is not fulfilled by @xmath72 is the one of symmetry , i.e. , that .",
    "if we denote all the quantities calculated when going from @xmath36 to @xmath41 by subscripting them with the label @xmath85 and the ones corresponding to the opposite process with @xmath86 , we have that :    @xmath87^{2}}{n-2 } } \\ , ,   \\cr d(v_{2},v_{1 } ) & = & \\alpha      \\sqrt{\\frac{{\\sum}_{i=1}^{n }      [ v_{1}({\\vec q}_{i})/b_{21}-        ( v_{2}({\\vec q}_{i})+a_{21}/b_{21})]^{2}}{n-2 } } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , if the equality is to be hold for every set of conformations @xmath88 , one must require that and .",
    "these two relations impose complicated conditions over the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 which are not generally fulfilled .",
    "the origin of this lack of symmetry is completely consistent with the assumptions made about the random character of the two instances of the potential energy to be compared , namely , the hypothesis of zero variance of @xmath36 , which places the two potentials on a different footing .",
    "a more general distance may be defined ( j.l .",
    "alonso and p. echenique , in preparation ) that takes into account a possible indetermination in the _ measure _ of @xmath36 and that places the two potentials on the same footing .",
    "however , some remarks must be made about this . in the first place ,",
    "this asymmetry in the role played by each of the potential - energy instances is totally justified in the cases for which the situation intended to be modeled is actually asymmetric ; for example , if one s aim is to calculate the distance between a potential @xmath36 and an approximation @xmath41 , where @xmath36 may be considered either _ exact _",
    "( e.g. , quantum mechanical ) or much more accurate than @xmath41 .",
    "in such a case , the assumption of zero variance for @xmath36 and the difference in the roles played by both potentials is intrinsic to the situation studied . as a second remark",
    ", it must be stressed that the distance herein defined was never intended to be a mathematical distance , although some of the properties demanded to these objects are satisfactory and fairly intuitive .",
    "the meaning of the distance @xmath72 is encoded in the statistical statements derived from its value and the name _ distance _ must be used in a more relaxed manner than the one traditionally found in mathematics .",
    "finally , it must be pointed out that there is a situation in which the symmetry of the distance defined in this work holds , namely , the situation in which @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "when the number of conformations @xmath50 is very large , the statistical estimators @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the slope and the of the linear relation between @xmath36 and @xmath41 tend to the ideal values ( see footnote  [ foot : estimates ] ) and , in these conditions , the remaining requirements needed to satisfy symmetry are also fulfilled , i.e. , one has that @xmath93 , @xmath94 and , consequently , . and , the implication also hold .",
    "since @xmath36 and @xmath41 are physical energies defined up to a reference , this may be considered the reciprocal of .",
    "] this fact is relevant since there are many situations typically found in which @xmath95 , namely , those in which @xmath36 and @xmath41 are _",
    "proximate_. this is the case if one wants to assess the robustness of a potential - energy function ( a slight change in the parameters does not lead to a completely different energy ) or if the approximation performed is small .",
    "the two applications of the distance @xmath72 to a particular potential in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] are carried out in cases for which this _ proximity _ is achieved and the symmetry expected has been checked numerically .",
    "most of the finely tuned biomolecular events occur in a complex environment of unique characteristics : liquid water . therefore ,",
    "if one aims to correctly describe the crucial processes associated with proteins , dna and rna in living beings , a sufficiently accurate modeling of and interactions must be implemented . however , accuracy is not the only criterium to be followed when designing a solvation model .",
    "numerical complexity of the methods must be also taken into account , as computational power is always a limiting resource . a compromise between these two competing factors",
    "must be reached and precision may be traded for velocity , even if the understanding of the problem was complete and a great accuracy could be achieved .",
    "particularly , in the study of the protein folding problem , the search for the native state takes place in an astronomically large conformational space , as early realized by cyrus levinthal in 1969 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the internal energy of the system , which includes the water molecules and the protein , must be calculated a large number of times and the numerical complexity of the method chosen to account for the influence of water must be as low as allowed by the accuracy required to solve the problem .    despite being regarded as one of the most accurate implementations of solvent influence , explicit water models are presently too computationally demanding , allowing only short simulations of peptides with a small number of residues to be performed .",
    "another popular option is to use continuum models based on poisson ( pe ) or ( pbe ) equations @xcite , which are orders of magnitude faster than explicit solvent models , to account for the electrostatic part of the free energy of solvation @xcite .",
    "then , the nonelectrostatic part , which arises from the first layer of water molecules surrounding the solute and from the creation of the cavity , could be added in many ways , most of which are related to the _ solvent accessible surface area _ ( sasa ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that only the total free energy of solvation is thermodinamically defined and experimentally measurable .",
    "consequently , any partitioning of it is necessarily arbitrary and the free parameters contained in these continuum models ( such as the dielectric constant @xmath96 of the protein , the dielectric constant @xmath97 of the aqueous medium ( see footnote  [ foot : kappa ] ) , and the position of the surface that separates both regions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cavity ] ) ) , must be fit prior to use in order to agree with experiment or with more accurate methods .    in this section ,",
    "the dielectric constants are set to their standard values , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the characteristics of the surface of separation are modified .",
    "rigorously speaking , one would need an infinite number of parameters to completely specify this surface .",
    "however , it is used herein a restricted subset of all the possible surfaces , namely , those that can be obtained by rolling a sphere of radius @xmath98 on the outer side of the surface generated by adding @xmath99 to the van der waals radii of each atom ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cavity ] ) .",
    "the volume that the rolling sphere does not intersect is considered to belong to the protein region .",
    "typical values assigned to @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the literature are @xcite :    1 .   and , producing the _ van der waals surface _ 2 .   and , producing the _ molecular surface _ 3 .   and , producing the _ solvent accessible surface _    these three surfaces are customarily used as the separation between the two dielectric media when the poisson energy is calculated .",
    "however , it could be the case that a small change in the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 significantly alters the properties of this particular energy landscape .",
    "in such a situation , the choice of the surface would be crucial to the behaviour of the system .",
    "therefore , the robustness of the poisson energy to changes in @xmath98 and @xmath99 must be assessed .    to accomplish this",
    ", we study a particular system : the _ de novo _ designed protein known as @xcite ( pdb code 1l2y ) .",

    "must be compared to the radius of gyration of the native state .    using the finite differences apbs program @xcite , the electrostatic part of the solvation energy",
    "was numerically investigated in these conformations . to calculate this quantity",
    ", one must solve the poisson equation twice .",
    "first , the energy of the system is computed assuming that a dielectric with @xmath101 fills the whole space .",
    "second , one calculates the energy of the system with the dielectric geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] .",
    "finally , the first quantity is substracted from the second to yield the solvation energy .    in order to test the reliability of the program and as an application of the first possible use , described in section  [ sec : introduction ] , of the distance defined in this paper ,",
    "the sensitivity of the poisson energies to changes in the size of the grid @xmath102 used to solve the differential equation was studied . for algorithmic reasons ,",
    "the allowed values for @xmath102 in apbs must be of the form , with @xmath50 a positive integer .",
    "consequently , the poisson solvation energy of each of the 150 conformations of the protein was calculated with , , and .",
    "all the measures were repeated for different values of @xmath99 , ( 0.0 , 2.5 and ) and @xmath98 was fixed to .",
    "then , for each @xmath99 , i.e. without changing the parameters , the distance ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : def_d ] ) between the energies calculated with a grid size @xmath103 ( playing the role of @xmath36 ) and the ones calculated with @xmath104 ( playing the role of @xmath41 ) was measured .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_dime ] .    two conclusions may be drawn from these data .",
    "one one hand , as the size of the grid @xmath102 increases , the distance @xmath72 dimishes .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that , when the accuracy of an approximation augments , the differences between an _ exact _ potential energy and its approximated counterpart tend to disappear . on the other hand",
    ", one sees that , for values of @xmath102 between 97 and 129 , the algorithm implemented in apbs has practically converged ; in the sense that , for the worst case ( namely , the one with ) , the distance between the energies calculated with @xmath105 and @xmath106 is of the order of the thermal noise .",
    "two remarks must be made about this last fact .",
    "first , the situation with being the worst is easily understood if one realizes that the discontinuity of the electric field in the surface of separation is larger if the latter is closer to the charges .",
    "thus , a greater sensitivity to details is expected in this case .",
    "second , it must be stressed that the distances depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_dime ] place a lower bound in the distances to be considered meaningful when evaluating the robustness of the poisson energy .",
    "for example , if the parameter @xmath98 is slightly changed ( keeping @xmath99 fixed to , say , ) any distance obtained , using a grid size of 97 or 129 , that is below @xmath107 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : d_vs_dime ] ) could not be associated to the lack of robustness of the poisson solvation energy in that particular region of the parameter space , since it may be due to numerical inaccuracies of the algorithm .    having this in mind ,",
    "let us fix the grid size to 97 or 129 depending on the conformation or @xmath106 in order to keep the length of the grid cell below in each dimension . in practice , this led to using @xmath105 for the most compact and globular conformations and @xmath106 for the most extended ones . ] and evaluate the sensitivity of poisson solvation energy to changes in the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 that define the surface of separation , as an example of the application of the distance @xmath72 to the second use proposed in section  [ sec : introduction ]",
    "this is done in the particular region of the parameter space which is typically explored in the literature : for @xmath98 , the values 0.1 , 0.7 , 1.4 ( the van der waals radius of a water molecule ) and ; for @xmath99 , the values from 0.0 to in steps of . when @xmath99 is kept constant and @xmath98 is varied , the results on the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_rw ] are obtained ( only a few different values of @xmath99 are depicted ) .",
    "when , in turn , @xmath98 is held fixed and @xmath99 is varied , one obtains the results shown on the right side of the same figure . in this second case ,",
    "only the graphic corresponding to is depicted , as the results for different values of @xmath98 are practically identical . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_dime ] , each point corresponds to the distance between the instances of the poisson energy with the @xmath54th value of the varying parameter and the one with the inmediately greater @xmath108th value . of course",
    ", if two instances with very distant values of the parameters are compared , the measured distance is much larger than the values depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_rw ] . however , this is not relevant to assess the robustness , since only the distance between instances corresponding to slightly different parameters must be small in order to render a fit significant .    from the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_rw ] , one may extract some relevant conclusions .",
    "first , the two situations depicted are different in an important sense : while the robustness increases ( @xmath72 decreases ) as one moves towards larger values of @xmath99 holding @xmath98 constant , it does not change significantly in the opposite situation ( i.e. increasing @xmath98 with fixed @xmath99 ) .",
    "the same behaviour may be inferred from the fact that , on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_rw ] , graphics corresponding to different values of @xmath99 are found at different heigths , whereas , on the right side , the data with different values of @xmath98 produce almost identical results ( this is not shown for the sake of visual comfort ) .",
    "the second important fact that must be pointed out is that , in agreement with what one would expect , the robustness of the poisson solvation energy is minimum when the surface of separation is placed close to the molecule ( i.e. , small values of @xmath99 ) . in the left graphic of fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_rw ] , one sees that , when @xmath99 is of the size of the water molecule radius ( ) , the distance between instances of the potential energy produced by a small change in @xmath98 approximately reaches the largest numerical indetermination in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_dime ] and , consequently , the poisson energy may be considered robust to such a change . in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_rw ] , one finds that an equivalent level of robustness is only achieved at values of @xmath99 around if @xmath98 is held fixed and what is changed is @xmath99 .    to summarize ,",
    "one may conclude that the robustness of the electrostatic part of the solvation energy steadily increases when the surface that separates the two dielectric media is moved further away from the macromolecular solute .",
    "the largest value of the distance @xmath72 is of the order of @xmath109 when the surface of separation is placed on the molecular or van der waals surface ( ) and the sensitivity to parameter changes approximately reaches the numerical indetermination of the algorithm used when the surface is one layer of water molecules away from the protein .",
    "when calculating a term or the totality of a potential energy function in complex systems , two situations are often faced : the necessity to evaluate the relative accuracy of an approximation or an algorithm respect to a more precise calculation and the need to assess the significance of a free parameters fit .",
    "herein , a distance between two different instances of the same potential energy function has been devised , which may be used to answer the two preceding questions by making meaningful statistical statements about the way in which energy differences are modified when changing the algorithm or the parameters .    in section  [ sec : application ] , a practical example of the two cases is given by studying the sensitivity of the electrostatic part of the solvation energy to such changes .",
    "this example is useful , on one hand , to show that the distance behaves consistently in a real situation and , on the other hand , to estimate the robustness of the poisson energy when small changes are performed on the ideal surface that separates the protein cavity from the aqueous media .",
    "it is shown that this robustness , both to changes in @xmath98 and in @xmath99 , increases as the surface is moved further away from the macromolecule , being when the surface is placed at zero distance from the van der waals volume of the protein and reaching the numerical indetermination at a distance of around a layer of water molecules ( ) .",
