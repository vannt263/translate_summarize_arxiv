    "distance measurements are the key to understanding many central questions in astronomy .",
    "correct distance measurements permit one to map the matter distribution in the universe , study its dynamics , and to constrain certain cosmological parameters , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 . beyond the limits reached by the cepheid distance scale ( @xmath2  2000 km / s ) ,",
    "the method of surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) is one of the most accurate currently known , with a claimed error on single galaxy distances of @xmath3 .",
    "the approach is based on simple concepts .",
    "it can in principle be used to calibrate other methods , such as tully - fisher , @xmath4 and supernovae i @xcite , that extend beyond the limit of sbf detection .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the method s limitations in terms of distance and to identify the various sources of error affecting sbf measurements .",
    "recently , sbf have been successfully used to measure distances to galaxies with radial velocities up to 4000 km / s with ground  based telescopes , and up to 7000 km / s in optical bands using the hubble space telescope @xcite . a recent review of the method can be found in blakeslee et al .",
    "the technique was introduced by tonry and scheineder ( 1988 ) and is based on a simple concept : the poisson distribution of unresolved stars in a galaxy produces fluctuations in each pixel of the galaxy image .",
    "the variance of these fluctuations is proportional to the square of the flux of each star ( f@xmath5 ) times the number of stars per pixel(n  @xmath6 ) .",
    "while the mean flux per pixel does not depend on distance , the variance is inversely proportional to the square of the galaxy distance .",
    "the sbf amplitude is defined as the variance normalized to the mean flux of the galaxy , which then indicates the flux - weighted average stellar flux .",
    "this implies that the brightest stars ( in evolved populations , the red giant branch ) contribute most to the signal .",
    "the sbf signal is convolved with the point spread function ( psf ) created by the telescope optics and atmospheric seeing .",
    "this permits one to distinguish the galaxy fluctuations from white noise fluctuations in the image ( e.g. , photon shot noise , read  out noise and dark current ) , because in the fourier space white noise fluctuations have a flat spectrum . at the same time , the fluctuations are contaminated by the signal from external sources , such as background galaxies , globular clusters and foreground stars , that are also convolved with the psf . for these reasons , obtaining good sbf measurements",
    "requires good seeing and sufficiently long integration times to both extract the signal from photon shot noise , and to detect external sources and correctly estimate their luminosity function ; the latter then serves to estimate and remove the contribution of faint , undetected sources from the sbf amplitude .",
    "in addition , stellar populations vary from elliptical to elliptical , and the absolute amplitude of the fluctuations depends on these variations .",
    "this implies that the sbf amplitude is not _",
    "per se _ a standard candle at each wavelength , but rather that it must be calibrated as a function of stellar population .",
    "tonry and his collaborators have found an empirical calibration for the absolute magnitude of i  band sbf , via a linear relation with ( v  i ) color that demonstrates a universal zero point and slope @xcite .",
    "this calibration is supported by theoretical predictions from worthey s stellar population models @xcite . when making optical sbf measurements , it is thus necessary to have both v and i - band images of the observed galaxies , to obtain the precise ( v  ",
    "i ) photometry necessary for the calibration .    in recent years",
    "the method has been extended to infrared bands for several reasons @xcite .",
    "firstly , in these bands the contrast between the brightest red giants and the underlying stellar population is more extreme than in the optical , producing larger sbf at any given distance .",
    "secondly , the color contrast between the sbf and point sources ( globular clusters and background galaxies ) is larger than in the i  band .",
    "moreover , at ground facilities , the k  band seeing is intrinsically better than i  band seeing , which further enhances the sbf contrast .",
    "relative to the theoretical predictions @xcite , k - band sbf absolute amplitudes are predicted to have only a weak dependence on ( v  i ) and a potentially larger scatter , because the effects of age and metallicity are less degenerate than in the i - band .",
    "ellipticals measured to date @xcite show an almost constant k - band sbf absolute amplitude , suggesting that these fluctuations may provide a good standard candle .",
    "these arguments lead one to believe that , in the infrared , it is possible to make sbf measurements to a greater distance than in the optical , and that in the future , most sbf measurements will be taken at this wavelength .",
    "on the other hand , the ground  based background level in infrared bands is higher than in the optical , making detection of extended sources more difficult .",
    "jensen and his collaborators have measured k - band sbf out to 7000  km / s from ground  based telescopes @xcite .",
    "their integration times did not permit them to obtain a high signal  to  noise ratio , and they also found residual spatial variations that contaminated their sbf measurements . the low signal  to  noise ratio of most current observations , the limited size of the sample and the low ( v  i ) coverage of the jensen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sample ( ( v  ",
    "i ) @xmath7 1.15 ) prevent us from being entirely confident in the precision of k - band sbf measurements as a standard candle .",
    "moreover , some of the ellipticals with sbf distance measurements in both i and k - bands show a discrepancy between the two @xcite , suggesting that either the measurements are affected by systematic errors ( i.e. , insufficient signal  to  noise ) , or by the presence of stellar populations that can alter the measurement and that are not taken properly into account in the present calibration .",
    "anomalously bright cool stellar populations may already have been detected in some ellipticals @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the accuracy and usefulness of the sbf method by studying the different sources of error inherent in the method .",
    "we wish to quantify the error budget for sbf measurement due to : a ) stellar population effects ; b ) observational constraints ; and c ) data processing .",
    "this study permits us to better understand the potential and the limitations of the method when applied in different wave bands and at different distances .",
    "we have simulated galaxies in the i and in the k  -  band using theoretical models by bruzual & charlot @xcite to study the effects of population variations in the infrared .",
    "to i - band and k - band models we have added external sources and then extracted distance measurements after varying the sbf signal  to  noise ratio , the seeing , and completeness magnitude for point sources detection . in  2 we discuss the role of different stellar populations .",
    "we present our analysis of the observational constraints and data treatment in  3 , and discuss the results in  4 .",
    "the attraction of a high intrinsic sbf amplitude in the infrared may be negated by the effect of stellar population variations . by studying stellar population effects",
    ", our aim is to understand the error on the empirical calibration in the k - band from a theoretical point  of  view , and the error that arises from the presence of different stellar populations .",
    "this can be seen as a two  fold problem .",
    "on one hand , if the dispersion in k  band absolute magnitudes , or in its dependence on galaxy colors , is small enough , we will be able to make distance measurements with reasonable accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , if different stellar populations have significantly different absolute magnitudes , we might be able to distinguish populations of different age or metallicity .",

    "we compare the observations to bruzual and charlot models with composite stellar populations , where each composite stellar population is a mixture of two identical  age populations of different metallicities . to a main population of fixed age ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 12 , and 15 gyrs ) and solar metallicity ( @xmath15 )",

    "the fluctuation colors of these simple composite models are all compatible with the current observations ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite ) .",

    "for the globular clusters , these residuals are given by @xcite : @xmath69 }   \\nonumber\\\\ & erfc[\\frac{m_{cut}-m_{peak}+0.8\\sigma^2ln(10)}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma } ] \\label{eq : cgc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the telescope zero  point magnitude ( the magnitude for which 1adu / sec is collected ) and @xmath53 is the magnitude cut determined by the completeness of the sample in each region in which we measure sbf .",
    "for the background galaxies , the residual contribution is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the pixel scale .",

    "we calculated the errors on @xmath57 and @xmath64 from the variance of their fitted values over the simulations .",
    "using these latter values , we then calculated the errors on the external source fluctuation residuals .",
    "the error on the globular cluster peak has been taken to be 0.15  mag when @xmath53 is equal to @xmath78 , 0.20  mag when @xmath53 is equal to @xmath83 , 0.25  mag when @xmath53 is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "these values are an estimate of the error on the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function from published data @xcite .",
    "more detailed simulations are needed to better quantify this error .",
    "the errors due to zero  point determination and the absolute magnitude calibration of the fluctuations were added to derive a total error on distance measurements .",
    "we have taken the error in the zero  point magnitude to be 0.02  mag in the i  band , and 0.03  mag in the k  band .",
    "the error on the fluctuation absolute magnitude was set to 0.08  mag in the i  band , from the tonry et al.(2000 ) calibration , and 0.12  mag from the dispersion of the k  band data available from jensen et al .",

    "if the errors on the zero - point magnitude and on the absolute magnitude calibration of the fluctuations would be the same in the k as in the i  band , the total percentage error on distance in the k  band will change by 0.01 - 0.03% .",

    "the systematic error on cepheid zero point , 0.16  mag @xcite , was included . as we can see from the figures , with a seeing equal to 0.6@xmath27 , in both i and in k",

    "a seeing equal to 1@xmath27 , for large distances , the typical errors on measurements are similar .",
    "the key quantity is therefore the integration time necessary for the detection of external sources ( which depends both on distance and on seeing ) and crowding effects .",
    "reaching the peak magnitude of the globular cluster luminosity function is time expensive to realise in practice .",
    "typical observations will attain a completeness in external source detection between one to one and half magnitude fainter than the estimated peak magnitude of the globular cluster luminosity function",
    ". this will be the major source of error on large distance measurements . in our simulations",
    ", we fixed the peak and the dispersion of the globular cluster luminosity function , when fitting it .",
    "we assumed an error on the globular cluster luminosity function peak equal to 0.15  mag when @xmath53 is equal to @xmath78 , 0.20  mag when @xmath53 is equal to @xmath83 , 0.25  mag when @xmath53 is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "these values have been chosen from published data @xcite and they take into account the fact that the error will increase as @xmath53 falls below @xmath78 .",
    "more detailed simulations would be needed to further quantify this point .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig - compik ] and figure  [ fig - totcompik ] what the calculated errors would be in both bands when not taking in account any error on @xmath78 , in the case in which the seeing is equal to 0.6@xmath27 .",
    "we can now compare the two bands . from figure  [ fig - totperi ] and figure  [ fig - totperk ] , the first difference to note between the two bands is that , while in the i  band the percentage error changes significantly as a function of the cut  off magnitude , in the k  band the error tends to degenerate to closest values . this is because of the higher color contrast of the fluctuations in k with respect to the external source color in this band .",
    "the percentage contribution of external source fluctuations to sbf fluctuations does not change as dramatically as in the i  band when the cut  off changes by one or two magnitudes .",
    "one could at this point think that this peculiar characteristic of the k  band would permit us to reach larger distances in this band than in the i  band .",
    "this is actually not true from the ground , due to the long integration time required to detect external sources down to a significant cut  off magnitude in the presence of the high background in the k  band .",
    "in fact , given these results and knowing the vlt i and k  band integration times required to obtain the signal  to  noise ratios that we considered , we can put limits on the distance attainable within a given percentage distance error . for a galaxy of absolute v magnitude of -23 , we have predicted from simulations that it is possible in the i  band , with a total ( integration time plus overheads ) exposure time no larger than 12 hours and a sky of 19.2 mag / arcsec@xmath25 , to reach distances up to @xmath86 mpc , or , for @xmath87=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath12 6500 km / s , within an error of @xmath12 10% for a seeing equal to 0.6 @xmath27 ( assuming to detect external source up to a cutoff magnitude one magnitude below the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function ) . if the total exposure time can be increased to 24 hours , it will be possible , under the same conditions , to reach distances around @xmath12 10000 km / s . in the k  band , with a total exposure time no larger than 12 hours , it is possible to reach distances up to @xmath88 mpc , or , for @xmath87=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath12 3000km / s , with an error of around 10 % and a seeing equal to 0.6@xmath27 when a sky of 13 mag / arcsec@xmath25 is assumed ; or @xmath12 3500km / s when a sky magnitude of 13.7 mag / arcsec@xmath25 is assumed ( assuming to detect external source up to a cutoff magnitude two magnitudes below the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function ) . if the total exposure time can be increased to 24 hours , it will be possible , under the same conditions , to reach distances around @xmath12 4000 km / s with an error around 15 % , with a seeing equal to 1@xmath27 .",
    "we have assumed an overhead of approximately 50% .",
    "we thus conclude that while i  band sbf observations at ground  based large telescopes will permit one to extend the current ground  based sample out to 650010000  km / s , k  band sbf measurements from the ground alone will be limited by the high infrared background .",
    "hybrid approaches , as already pointed out by jensen and his collaborators @xcite can combine sbf observations in the k  band with external source detection in the i  band , reducing expensive exposure time in the k  band while maintaining a correct estimation of the external source contribution . on the one hand , when external sources are detected in the i  band around one magnitude below @xmath78 , this approach has the advantage of providing two independent ( even if there will not be an independent external source detection ) sbf distance measurements , or of providing information on the galaxy stellar population . on the other hand , as can be seen from figure  [ fig - totperk ] , when external sources are detected for @xmath53 larger than @xmath78 - 1 , i ",
    "band distance measurements present errors from 10@xmath89 to 50@xmath89 , while k  band measurement errors at the same @xmath53 are around @xmath90 . a more detailed study of combining i and k  band surveys has to be explored , in order to define the optimal approach depending on distance and on observing conditions .",
    "we must point out that the errors that we have derived are lower limits .",
    "we are estimating errors within the available observational constraints and standard data processing .",
    "we have not considered other sources of error , such as anomalous boxiness or diskiness of the galaxy , or profiles differing from a standard de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "we have assumed that these effects are negligible and corrected by the smooth fit of the residual image after the first subtraction of the galaxy model .",
    "we did not consider crowding effects on the detection of external sources .",
    "we assumed the error on the globular cluster luminosity function peak in function of @xmath53 , but did not strengthened these values with simulations .",
    "more detailed simulations would be needed to further quantify these points .",
    "we can compare these theoretical predictions with vlt i - band sbf that we measured in ic 4296 @xcite , an elliptical galaxy in abell 3565 ( @xmath12 3500 km / s ) .",
    "for this galaxy we have measured a distance modulus of @xmath91 mag and a galaxy distance of @xmath92 mpc . from hst",

    "the seeing of this observation was 0.7@xmath27 .",
    "we obtain a completeness magnitude at around one magnitude brighter than the globular cluster luminosity function peak . the percentage error on distance that we obtained on ic  4296",
    "is @xmath12 8% , this error is consistent with our monte carlo prediction of @xmath1210% for external source detection up to one magnitude brighter than the globular cluster luminosity function peak , as presented in section 3.2 , fig .",
    "the error on distance that we obtain with 2.3 hours of integration time are comparable to 3.2 hours integration time from the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "this result confirms the potential of 8m class telescope in large distance ground  based sbf observations .",
    "ground  based observations from large telescopes are thus competitive with space observations , but with the advantage of larger fields of view , permitting one to measure more ellipticals in the same field .",
    "our conclusions are also in agreement with the recent observations and conclusions from tonry et al .",
    "we have evaluated in this paper the potential of sbf measurements in the i and in the k  band .",

    "( 2001)also predict higher amplitude fluctuations in younger populations , but a much weaker metallicity dependence .",
    "the variation of the absolute sbf might explain the higher than average sbf , observed in some of the low signal  to  noise sample of jensen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and pahre & mould ( 1994 ) , as well as the higher than standard k  band fluctuations observed by mei et al . ( 2001a ) in ngc  4489 . at present , galaxies with anomalous low fluctuations have not been observed .",

    "( 1998 ) sample from which the current k    band calibration is derived . from theoretical predictions , its higher k ",
    "band sbf amplitude can be explained both by the presence of an intermediate age population ( from liu et al .",
    "2000 predictions ) or by a difference in metallicity , quantified from the difference in ( v  i ) ( predictions from blakeslee et al .",
    "2001 models ) .",
    "additional k  band sbf data over a larger range of galaxy colors and luminosities are necessary to improve the precision on the empirical calibration . a better calibration at lower ( v  i ) would permit one to discriminate between the liu et al . ( 2000 ) and blakeslee et al . (",
    "2001 ) predictions .",

    "according to our results , the vlt and other very large telescopes will permit us to extend sbf distance measurements in the i  band to a distance @xmath12 6500 km / s within a percentage error on single galaxy distance of @xmath12 10 % . in the k  band , distances @xmath12 3000 kms will be reached with a percentage error on distance of @xmath12 10 % .",
    "this error can be compared to the single galaxy distance percentage error @xmath12 10 % that can be obtained by the pnlf method and supernovae type ia , and it is smaller than the 15 - 20% distance error that can be obtained by tully - fisher and @xmath97 .",
    "this means that sbf distance measurements on large telescopes will permit us to extend the current ground  based i  band sample to twice the current distance limit , to calculate bulk flows beyond the current limit of 3000 km / s @xcite , and to compare distances and peculiar velocities with those derived from other methods .    on the other hand , measuring in the k  band alone does not permit us to go very deep in distance from the ground , due the high background level in the infrared and the high integration times needed to detect external sources .",
    "jensen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have made extensive use of optical images for external source detection .",
    "they have derived globular cluster luminosity functions from the i  band image of the galaxies that they observed in the k  band , and employed it to correct the external source contribution to the sbf fluctuations in the k  image .",
    "this method requires both i and k images of the same galaxies , and permits one to clearly identify the sbf fluctuations in the k  band with no contamination .",
    "the optimal use of both bands for distance measurements has to be studied with more detailed simulations , but it is nevertheless useful in two other respects .",
    "firstly , it enables us to discriminate among stellar population models .",
    "secondly , the use of combined i and k  band sbf will help us gain knowledge on k  band sbf calibration in preparation for space  based observations , that are possible on nicmos on the hst @xcite and will be possible with the ngst .",
    "in fact , in space the background in the k  band is significantly lower and the required source extraction will be possible in reasonable integration times .",
    "current k ",
    "band measurements from the ground might thus help in stellar population model discrimination and study of stellar population age and metallicity in elliptical galaxies @xcite , and can lay the basis for further k  band sbf measurements from the space .",
    "in this paper we have shown that :    1 .",
    "recent stellar population models @xcite give contradictory predictions for k  band sbf .",
    "it is necessary to enlarge the sample of k  band measurements to lower ( v  i ) to obtain a dependable calibration of the k  band sbf absolute magnitude . at the same time , the jensen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) empirical mean is compatible with theoretical models for bright , red galaxies that will be the galaxies observed at large distances . in our simulations we used bruzual & charlot ( 2000 ) stellar population models , as did liu et al .",
    "there models predict that k - band sbf are driven by both age and metallicity , in the sense that increasing metallicity and decreasing age produce larger k  band sbf ( i.e. brighter sbf magnitudes ) .",
    "the effect of metallicity is much larger than the effect of age .",
    "the k  band sbf amplitude becomes higher for redder populations .",
    "it seems possible that stellar population effects will have a larger impact in the k - band , especially for lower luminosity ellipticals , making individual k - band based distance measurements more uncertain . in other words",
    ", there may not be a a simple linear relationship between color and k - band sbf magnitude , as there is in the i - band .",
    "further k - band sbf measurements of selected galaxy samples remain critically necessary for understanding these stellar population effects and for disentangling the current disagreements between theoretical predictions of k - band sbf magnitudes and colors . for this kind of study ,",
    "ground  based work is appropriate .",
    "ground  based observations in the k",
    " band will lay the basis for more precise k ",
    "band sbf measurements from space , for example , with nicmos on hst @xcite and , in the future , with the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) .",
    "our monte carlo simulations indicate that very large ground  based telescopes , such as the vlt , will permit one to extend i  band sbf distance measurements out to 600010000 km / s , with an error of 1015% .",
    "3 .   relative to ground  based i - band sbf measurements , it appears that , unless optical data are available to aid in the external source removal , ground  based k - band sbf measurements are prohibitively expensive for obtaining large numbers of distance measurements at large distances , while space  based k  band observations are more efficient .",
    "these conclusions need to be strengthened by exploring a wider range of parameters and by more extensive simulations of errors due to the corrections of the external source contribution , to the psf template fitting , and to irregular isophotes .",
    "our approach is novel for its application of realistic monte carlo simulations of sbf observations .",
