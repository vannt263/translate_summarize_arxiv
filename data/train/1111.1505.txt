    "anderson models are known to exhibit a region of localized states , either at the edges of the spectrum , or in a given range of energies if the disorder is large enough . within this region of localization",
    "it is natural to study the two basic components of the spectral theory in this case : the eigenfunctions ( how localized they are , etc ) , and the eigenvalues ( their multiplicity , their statistics , etc ) .",
    "the localization properties of eigenfunctions in the localized phase are by now quite well understood ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the precise description of these localization properties plays an important role in the understanding of many physical phenomena ( e.g. dynamical localization , constancy of the hall conductance in quantum hall systems , mott formula ) .",
    "much less works have been devoted to the understanding of the eigenvalues statistics of the anderson model ; while for random matrices many more results are available ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "poisson statistics of anderson eigenvalues have been studied in @xcite .",
    "+ an important ingredient that enters the proof of localization is a so called wegner estimate that controls the probability of finding an eigenvalue of the finite volume operator in a small interval of energy . as for poisson statistics , the analysis of @xcite relies on localization properties , the wegner estimate and on a so called minami estimate that enables one to control the probability of the occurrence of two eigenvalues of the finite volume operator in a small interval of energy .",
    "it is worth mentioning that simplicity of the spectrum is a direct consequence of localization properties combined with a minami estimate @xcite .",
    "+ recently , in @xcite , the present authors introduced a refined way of describing eigenvalues and centers of localization in finite volumes , through a reduction procedure that enables one to approximate eigenvalues at finite volume by independent and identically distributed random variables . with this reduction in hand",
    ", they could in particular extend known results about poisson statistics and obtain the first asymptotic result for the eigenlevel spacings distribution .",
    "@xcite used this reduction to study the local ergodicity of the unfolded eigenvalues .",
    "+ in the present article , we introduce enhanced wegner and minami estimates that we only only within the region of localization .",
    "the main novelty is that they take into account the weight that the integrated density of states ( ids ) gives to intervals to estimate the probabilities of the occurrence of a single or of multiple eigenvalues in a small energy interval .",
    "these estimates enable us to revisit the reduction procedure mentioned above and get better controls .",
    "we thus remove some limitations of @xcite and cover situations where the ids gets too small for the analysis of @xcite to be valid : this happens when the ids is exponentially small in an inverse power of the length of the interval . as an application ,",
    "our results enable us to prove poisson statistics for the unfolded eigenvalues in dimension 1 at the band edges , that is where a lifshitz tail regime occurs . to our best knowledge , this is the first such result . + as another application , we provide improved large deviation estimates for the number of finite volume eigenvalues contained in suitably scaled intervals , as well as a central limit theorem for this quantity .",
    "we consider the discrete anderson hamiltonian @xmath1 acting on @xmath2 , where    * @xmath3 is a convolution matrix with exponentially decaying off - diagonal coefficients i.e. exponential off - diagonal decay that is @xmath4 such that , * * @xmath5 for @xmath6 and for some @xmath7 , @xmath8 . *",
