    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have dramatically enhanced our understanding of the universe .",
    "the recent focus has been on the detection of polarization in the cmb because it provides information complementary to what can be learned from the temperature anisotropy .",
    "the discovery and characterization of the polarization not only confirms the cosmological interpretation of the origin of the temperature anisotropy and large - scale structures , but also improves the accuracy with which we measure parameters in our cosmological model , such as the epoch of reionization .",
    "so far detection of cmb polarization has been reported by dasi @xcite , cbi @xcite , capmap @xcite , boomerang @xcite , and wmap @xcite . here",
    "we report results from maxipol with particular emphasis on the data analysis procedure and cosmological results .",
    "a companion paper @xcite emphasizes the polarimetric instrumentation and observations .",
    "maxipol flew from the nasa columbia scientific ballooning facility in ft .",
    "sumner , new mexico in may 2003 . a region of about 8 square degrees , with galactic coordinates @xmath16 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , was scanned during a 7.6 hour night scan .",
    "this region was located near the star beta ursae minoris ( ) . the beam size was 10 arcminutes .",
    "we present data collected with 12 polarimeters that have a center frequency of 140  ghz .",
    "polarimetry was implemented by rotating a half - wave plate ( hwp ) at a frequency of 1.86  hz and analyzing the modulating polarization with a stationary grid .",
    "we refer the reader to the companion paper @xcite and to other publications for a more thorough review of maxipol and its predecessor maxima @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of cmb radiation can be described using the four stokes parameters : the intensity @xmath22 , the linear polarization @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the circular polarization @xmath23 .",
    "the anisotropy in @xmath22 ( also called the temperature @xmath24 ) has been well measured .",
    "the circular component @xmath23 can only arise from parity violating physics and is believed to be absent from the cmb ( though this has not been experimentally verified ) .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters arise during the last - scattering process and have been the focus of recent experimental and theoretical work .",
    "their presence is evidence for the standard scenario of the last scattering process and their characteristics carry information complementary to the temperature anisotropy .",
    "alternative to the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one may express the polarization in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are curl and divergence free polarization tensors respectively . for noise - free all - sky data",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 can be converted to and from @xmath25 and @xmath26 exactly .",
    "otherwise one can only make a statistical conversion between the two .",
    "models of cosmological evolution usually predict the cmb in the form of power spectra : the auto - correlations @xmath27 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 , and the cross - correlations @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we report on measurements of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 stokes parameters , and the corresponding @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 polarization power spectra .",
    "we used two alternative statistical approaches to extract quantities of interest from the data , the bayesian and frequentist approaches .",
    "both have been used successfully in the analysis of cosmological data . for a given set of data ,",
    "the bayesian approach gives the smallest error interval for the estimated quantities , but its application is sometimes computationally intractable .    in our analysis we demodulated the timestreams and subsequently used a bayesian maximum - likelihood approach to make best - fit maps of the stokes parameters .",
    "we then estimated the @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 polarization power spectra of the cmb using both bayesian and frequentist approaches . in both cases we accounted for known instrumental effects and conducted tests for systematic errors",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ formalism ]",
    "we describe our analysis formalism and procedures for estimating @xmath2 and @xmath3 maps from the time - ordered data ( tod ) , and power spectra from these maps . in section  [ results ] , we present our results , including the maps , the power spectra , and systematic tests .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the time - ordered data ( tod ) were flagged for the presence of transient signals and calibrated using laboratory data and observations of jupiter .",
    "they were cut into segments separated by gaps longer than 30 seconds , depending on both the flagging of transient signals and the stationarity of noise .",
    "various tests were performed to ensure the gaussianity and stationarity of the noise within each segment @xcite . from each segment we estimated and removed an instrumental signal that was synchronous with the rotation of the hwp , which we call hwp synchronous signal @xcite , and deconvolved the instrumental filters .",
    "see @xcite for more details about these data processing steps .",
    "the tod of each of the polarimeters can be modelled as    @xmath30 + n_t,\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 is time , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the instrumental noise at time @xmath33 , @xmath38 is the sky position of the pointing at time @xmath33 , and @xmath39 is the modulation efficiency of the polarimeter .",
    "the units of @xmath40 are @xmath41k and thus a calibration factor converting from the measured voltage to temperature has already been included .",
    "we present our results in the wmap convention with the stokes parameters @xmath22 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , taking the north galactic pole as the direction of reference for the polarization @xcite .",
    "the angle @xmath42 is the rotation angle of a vector pointing along a great circle to the zenith , measured relative to the polarization reference vector on the sky .",
    "the transmission axis of the polarization analyzer is oriented at 90 degrees to the zenith direction .",
    "the angle @xmath43 is the rotation angle of the hwp relative to the transmission axis of the polarization analyzer . during the observations , @xmath44 changed at a rate of 15 degrees per hour giving a frequency of @xmath45  hz while @xmath46 varied at @xmath47  hz .",
    "thus @xmath48  hz . the temporal data @xmath40 are sampled at intervals of @xmath49 seconds .",
    "the telescope tracked the guide star while scanning in azimuth by 2 degrees peak to peak at a constant frequency @xmath50  hz for the majority of the data . here",
    "the subscript @xmath51 denotes the scan angle .",
    "figure  [ beta_eta ] shows typical measurements of @xmath52 and @xmath51 from a subset of the data .    to obtain the time - ordered polarization data ( topd ) we demodulated the tod to produce independent data streams for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . because of the combination of the hwp rotation and the sky scan , the cmb signal is in side - bands of the fourth harmonic of @xmath46 .",
    "multiplication of the appropriate sinusoid and applying a band - pass filter gives the topd from the tod    [ lockin ] @xmath53 the brackets denote a band - pass top - hat filter between 0.05  hz and 1.5  hz .",
    "this filter selects the frequencies where signals are expected and removes residuals of the hwp synchronous signal , if they exist .",
    "figure  [ pf - dt ] shows a power spectrum of a section of the data @xmath40 before demodulation .",
    "the residual peaks ( marked by arrows ) indicate residuals of subtraction of the hwp synchronous signal .",
    "the residuals are at harmonics of @xmath54 .",
    "( figure 6 in the companion paper  @xcite shows a similar power spectrum for a different section of the data where the subtraction is more complete . )",
    "figure  [ pf - lockin ] shows the power spectrum of the data @xmath40 multiplied by @xmath55 , but before the band - pass filtering ; that is , the quantity inside the brackets of equation  ( [ lockin - a ] ) .",
    "the gray area indicates the signal band selected by the band - pass filter .",
    "the low side of the band - pass is determined by the scan speed and the high side by the @xmath561.3  hz cut - off due to the beam .",
    "the power spectrum within the band is consistent with white noise and residuals of the hwp synchronous signal are out of band .",
    "simulations with different plausible power spectra for the underlying signal show that the band - pass filtering reduced the rms of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 maps by 4% regardless of the details of the spectra .",
    "this loss of signal was compensated for by a monte - carlo approach , which we describe later .",
    "several effects can bias our estimation of the topd when using equations ( [ lockin ] ) .",
    "the beam convolution inevitably removes signal on angular scales smaller than @xmath57  arcminutes .",
    "we rectified this by a deconvolution procedure during cmb power spectrum estimation using recipes given in @xcite .",
    "these recipes also cope with the asymmetry in the beams .",
    "this deconvolution is discussed in section  [ ps - estimation ] .",
    "a second effect is that an imperfect implementation of the demodulation may introduce a bias in the estimation of the cmb signal .",
    "for example , the band - pass filtering is equivalent to a convolution in the time domain so that it induces correlations in the scan direction while giving rise to some loss of signal .",
    "a third effect is that the deglitching of the data for the transients creates small gaps in the tod , and thus may have influenced the demodulation process .",
    "the second and third effects were estimated and corrected by a monte - carlo approach , as described in section [ ps - estimation ] .",
    "we employed a standard maximum - likelihood method to obtain maps of @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the topd . in the time domain",
    "the topd can be modelled as @xmath58 where @xmath59 or @xmath3 , @xmath60 is the cmb signal and @xmath61 is the instrumental noise .",
    "we note that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are independent and thus uncorrelated because the demodulation processes to obtain @xmath64 and @xmath65 employ orthogonal kernels ( see eqs .",
    "( [ lockin ] ) ) .",
    "we model the cmb signal as @xmath66 and use the einstein summation convention when appropriate . here",
    "@xmath67 is the pointing matrix giving the weight of pixel @xmath68 in observation @xmath33 , and @xmath69 is the cmb signal in the pixel .",
    "we took the pointing operator @xmath67 to be unity when observing pixel @xmath68 at time @xmath33 and zero otherwise .",
    "that is , we assumed the signal @xmath60 to be constant within pixel @xmath68 .",
    "this model of pixelization induces an extra convolution effect in addition to that from the beam . to deal with these convolution effects",
    "we followed the recipes in @xcite .",
    "these provide a way to transfer all these convolution effects into a single @xmath70 in multipole space , which can then be deconvolved when estimating the cmb power spectrum @xmath71 .    with this modeling , we can estimate the pixelized maps @xmath72 from the temporal data @xmath73 . in the pixel domain",
    "we can also model @xmath72 as a linear sum of the signal and the noise components : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the noise in the pixel domain . under the assumptions that the noise in the temporal domain is gaussian and that all cmb maps are a - priori equally likely , the maps @xmath72 can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the signal given the data .",
    "this gives @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the time - time noise correlation matrix and @xmath79 is the estimated pixel - pixel noise correlation matrix given by @xmath80^{-1}.    \\label{npp}\\ ] ]    we apply equations ( [ mp ] ) and ( [ npp ] ) to @xmath64 and @xmath65 to give the maps @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , as well as the noise correlation matrices @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the numerical implementation of these equations follows the method described in @xcite .",
    "we use square pixels that are 3 arcminutes on a side . to simplify notation",
    "we construct a column vector @xmath85 note that we use the subscript @xmath68 to denote pixels in the original maps and the subscript @xmath86 to denote pixels in the simplified notation .",
    "similarly we write @xmath87 here the off - diagonal blocks are zero in theory because of the orthogonality between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    after the maps are formed we apply a filtering to them @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a filtering matrix .",
    "the choice of the filter depends on the subsequent step in the data analysis . for bayesian power spectrum estimation",
    "the maps are left un - filtered ( or , equivalently , we apply an identity filter ) . for the frequentist approach",
    "we apply a noise - weighting filter to cope with the anisotropic noise in the pixel domain . because the hit count per pixel decreases towards the edge of the sky patch , as can be seen in figure  [ fig - scan ] , the s / n ratio is higher at the center . to prevent the resulting power spectra from being dominated by the low - s / n pixels , we use @xmath90 where @xmath3 is a column - vector with all entries equal to unity .",
    "we also tried other forms of the filter used by other authors ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and found that as long as the biasing effect of such filtering is accounted for with the monte - carlo process that we will describe later , the final cmb power spectra remain unchanged to a 10% level . for map display purposes we use a wiener filter @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the signal - signal correlation matrix . because the wiener filter amplifies expected signals in a model - dependent way it induces more bias than other filters that rely purely on the noise level measured from the data .",
    "we thus do not use the wiener filter for power spectrum estimation .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be expanded into spin-2 spherical harmonics in the conventional way : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the coefficients for the @xmath25- and @xmath26-mode polarization , respectively , and @xmath96 is a unit vector directed in the direction of observation .",
    "the polarization power spectra can then be defined as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "to estimate @xmath100 , we use two approaches , one bayesian and one frequentist , which are described in sec .",
    "[ ps - estimation - bayesian ] and [ ps - estimation - frequentist ] respectively . in the following we first lay out the formalism which is general to both approaches .",
    "because the sky coverage of our observation is finite , we do not probe independent @xmath100 for each multipole @xmath7 .",
    "instead , we bin the @xmath7 s and determine a band power within each @xmath7 bin . in addition , to increase the signal to noise ratio we use three bins @xmath101@xmath102 , @xmath103@xmath11 , and @xmath104 such that only the middle bin should have signal given the combination of beam size and sky area .    when estimating the band power and presenting the results we must specify a model for the shape of the power spectrum within each @xmath7 bin .",
    "given the binned values , we model the power spectra as    [ eq - shape ] @xmath105 where the subscript @xmath19 labels an @xmath7 bin , both @xmath106 and @xmath107 are treated as column vectors , @xmath108 is a square diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to @xmath109 and @xmath110 is a matrix defined as @xmath111 here @xmath107 is defined as the ` band power ' , and @xmath112 is called the ` shape function ' .    the model for the shape",
    "is encoded in @xmath112 .",
    "we investigate the following four cases :    [ eq : shape ] @xmath113 here the @xmath114 is the power spectrum predicted by the concordance model of the wmap+acbar+boomerang result in @xcite .",
    "it is a flat @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "consequently the power spectra for different models of the shape function are related to the estimated band power as    @xmath121    where @xmath122 or @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is the band power to be estimated .    prior to the estimation of the cmb power spectra , we also need to determine the effects of the beam convolution and of the map pixelization , so that these effects can be deconvolved during the estimation process .",
    "we follow the recipes described in @xcite .",
    "the two convolution effects are combined into a single transfer function @xmath70 in the multipole space : @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the effective @xmath128 of the beam and the pixelization , respectively .",
    "the resulting @xmath128 for maxipol are presented in figure  [ fig - bl2 ] .",
    "the individual @xmath126 of the maxipol polarimeters are somewhat smaller than those of maxima and thus produce a wider noise - weighted combination .",
    "the figure also shows that with a pixel size of 3 arc - minutes less than 2% of signal power for @xmath129 is attenuated by the pixelization .",
    "a commonly used bayesian approach for power spectrum estimation is the newton - raphson algorithm @xcite .",
    "we attempted to use this method to find the maxipol power spectra , but it failed in a variety of ways that we believe were due to the low signal - to - noise ratio of our maps .",
    "the region of parameter space we are exploring is close to the boundary where @xmath130 , and the allowed solutions include negative power values .",
    "this region has a non - smooth likelihood that makes the newton - raphson method unreliable .",
    "we note that future b - mode experiments with a low signal to noise ratio in their b - mode detection are likely to face the same problem .",
    "see also @xcite for high signal - to - noise cases where the newton - raphson method is also prone to failure .",
    "thus we adopted a markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) approach .",
    "the mcmc method explores the likelihood space of the map , @xmath131 .",
    "it generates lists of samples from a parameter space whose distribution is asymptotically the same as the posterior distribution of the parameters .",
    "this approach has a number of advantages : it fully explores the parameter space , making no assumptions about the shape of the likelihood surface , and can be used in any signal - to - noise regime .",
    "the mcmc method is valid in cases where the shape of the posteriors can not be assumed to take simple forms , such as a gaussian shape .",
    "it also has the important disadvantage of high computational cost .",
    "we used metropolis - hastings ( mh ) sampling , which is one of the simplest forms of mcmc .",
    "it has been widely used in cosmological parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "this method is also briefly mentioned in @xcite . in our case",
    "the parameters are binned @xmath71 and the random variable is the map vector , @xmath132 , made up of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 pixel values .",
    "we take the likelihood of the map vector to be gaussian , with zero mean and inter - pixel covariance matrices @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the noise covariance and @xmath135 the signal correlation matrix of the proposed @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "thus the likelihood was calculated exactly using @xmath136 .",
    "our mcmc code was derived from the spectrum solver madspec , which is part of madcap @xcite .",
    "the computation of the inverse matrix was the largest computational step and was done with a cholesky decomposition .    to generate sufficient samples for estimating the parameters we used two chains , each of approximately 50,000 samples .",
    "the calculation required 24 hours on 128 processors on the seaborg supercomputer , which belongs to the national energy research scientific computing center at lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "we are in the process of optimizing the method and believe sufficient computational savings can be made to make the algorithm scalable to somewhat larger datasets .",
    "posterior likelihoods for binned @xmath71 can easily be calculated with the mh algorithm , since the likelihood of a parameter value is proportional to its multiplicity in the chain . to perform these calculations we used the program getdist , a part of the cosmomc package @xcite , which also performs some convergence tests based on derived secondary chains .",
    "additional convergence tests based on power spectra of parameter values in the chain , proposed in @xcite , were also performed . in particular , the variance of the mean of the two chains was less than 10% of the mean of their variances for the parameters of interest .",
    "the choice of a good proposal density is critical to optimize the convergence rate of an mcmc chain .",
    "we followed the recommendations in @xcite : we first re - parameterized the space by the eigenvectors of the parameter covariance matrix to mitigate the effect of highly correlated parameters .",
    "new proposed jumps were generated along orthonormal basis vectors of this new parameter set which were randomly rotated every @xmath137 proposals .",
    "the length of the jump was a gaussian random variable with mean zero and the variance of the appropriately rotated eigenvalue multiplied by a scaling factor of @xmath138 .",
    "the covariance matrix was estimated with a short non - optimized mcmc .",
    "we also used a frequentist approach to estimate @xmath100 .",
    "frequentist approach was used in the past in analyses of other data sets @xcite .",
    "the following sections describe the steps in our analysis and figure  [ fig - flowchart ] shows a flowchart of the pipeline .    because the sky patch of our observation is only about 4 degrees across we approximate it as flat to speed up our computation .",
    "we use a discrete fourier transform ( dft ) to approximate the multipole expansion . with this approximation equation  ( [ qu - lm ] )",
    "can be reduced and reorganized as [ fft ] @xmath139 where a tilde denotes the fourier coefficient of the corresponding quantity , @xmath140 is a fourier mode , and @xmath141 is the phase angle of @xmath140 . the multipole number can thus be approximated as the wave number , @xmath142 . as a consequence , equation  ( [ cl - lm ] ) reduces to @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the area of the map used in the dft in steradians , and",
    "the brackets denote an average over all the wave vectors with @xmath145 .    to increase the s / n ratio per @xmath7 bin in our results , we combine the @xmath7 s into only three bins and estimate their band powers @xmath124 , instead of the @xmath100 , with a specified shape function ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shape ] ) and ( [ dn ] ) ) .",
    "this requires a modification of equation ( [ cl - k ] ) as @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the shape function @xmath148 convolved by the multipole transform of the sky - coverage window .",
    "note that prior to the dft , we apply the filtering of equations ( [ weighting ] ) and ( [ noise - weighting ] ) to the maps .",
    "due to the finite sky coverage , the flat - sky approximation , and the filtering of maps , equation ( [ cl - k2 ] ) is a biased estimator of the band powers .",
    "this bias is corrected using the monte - carlo approach .",
    "2.3.2.1 the pseudo - band powers    we apply the dft of equations  ( [ eb - k ] ) and ( [ cl - k2 ] ) to each of the square regions selected from the original maps @xmath72 shown in figure  [ fig - scan ] to obtain the estimated band powers @xmath149 , where a hat denotes an estimator .",
    "we refer to these as the ` pseudo'-band powers , because they are biased and contain noise .",
    "these pseudo - band powers can be modelled as    [ cl - pseudo ] @xmath150 where @xmath151 here the subscript @xmath152 denotes the index of @xmath19 that runs twice , and similarly for @xmath153 .",
    "the @xmath124 are the underlying cmb signals of the field , and the @xmath154 are the noise components of the pseudo - band powers .",
    "the @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 will be explained as follows .",
    "we call @xmath70 the ` beam transfer function ' , which has been discussed earlier .",
    "it accounts for the convolution effects from the beam pattern of each of the polarimeters and from the pixelization during the map - making process .",
    "we call the @xmath158 in equations ( [ cl - pseudo ] ) the ` time - domain transfer matrix ' .",
    "it is induced by the time - domain processing , including the effects from the demodulation and the deglitching of the data .",
    "here we use the same @xmath158 for all the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 modes because a signal - only monte - carlo simulation of 1,000 realizations indicate that it is the same to an accuracy of @xmath159 .",
    "this is essentially because the form of @xmath158 is dominated by the band - pass filter in the demodulation process and thus behaves simply as a convolution effect of the sky signal .",
    "we call @xmath157 in equations ( [ cl - pseudo ] ) the ` dft transfer matrix ' .",

    "the @xmath160 and @xmath161 are dominated by the self - coupling and the geometric mixing of e and b polarization respectively @xcite .",
    "with the formalism ( [ cl - pseudo ] ) established , our task becomes to obtain an unbiased estimator of @xmath124 .",
    "this requires a inversion of equations ( [ cl - ee - bb - pseudo ] ) and ( [ cl - eb - pseudo ] ) . as will be shown",
    ", the forms of @xmath158 and @xmath157 do not need to be estimated individually .",
    "instead , we estimate the overall transfer matrices @xmath162 and @xmath163 given a specified shape function @xmath164 and the measured @xmath70 , and then compute their inverses .",
    "2.3.2.2 estimation of the noise component    following the frequentist approach , we estimate the noise component @xmath165 in equations  ( [ cl - pseudo ] ) by using the previously estimated pixel - pixel noise correlation matrix @xmath166 to carry out a monte - carlo simulation for the noise - only maps .",
    "a cholesky decomposition gives @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a lower triangular matrix .",
