    "<S> we investigate theoretically the interplay between the effects of a perpendicular electric field and incommensurability at the interface on the electronic properties of a heterostructure of bilayer graphene and a semiconducting substrate with a unit cell almost three times larger then that of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the former introduces an asymmetry in the distribution of the electronic wave function between the layers and opens a band gap in the electronic spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the latter generates a long wavelength periodic moir perturbation of graphene electrons which couples states in inequivalent graphene brillouin zone corners and leads to the formation of minibands . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , depending on the details of the moir perturbation , the miniband structure can be tuned from that with a single band gap at the neutrality point and over - lapping minibands on the conduction / valence band side to a situation where a single narrow miniband is separated by gaps from the rest of the spectrum . </S>"
