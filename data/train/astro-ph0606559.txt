    "since the confirmation by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations of the cosmic microwave background that the large scale ( @xmath0 in comoving units ) auto - correlation function of temperature fluctuations is close to zero [ fig .  16 , @xcite ( orthogonally projected spatial scale ) ; fig .  1 of @xcite ( non - projected spatial scale ) ] and difficult to reconcile with a standard cosmic concordance model ( 7 of @xcite",
    "; though see also @xcite ) there has recently been considerable observational interest in understanding multiply connected models of the universe .",
    "the poincar dodecahedral space ( pds ) has been proposed as a better model of the 3-manifold of comoving space rather than an `` infinite '' flat space ( e.g. @xcite ; though see also @xcite ) .",
    "curvature estimates are consistent with the model : analysis of the 3-year wmap data @xcite results in best estimates of the total density parameter @xmath1 ( when combined with hst key project on @xmath2 data ) and @xmath3 ( when combined with supernova legacy survey data ) , or together with the third , fourth and fifth acoustic peaks , as estimated from their observations near the south galactic pole using the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar ) , @xmath4 is obtained @xcite , consistently with that expected from the pds analyses , which require positive curvature in this range of @xmath5 values .",
    "it has also recently become noticed that global topology in a universe containing density perturbations can , in principle , have at least some effect on the metric , even though the effect is expected to be small . at the present epoch , in the case of a @xmath6 model of fundamental lengths which are slightly unequal by a small fraction @xmath7",
    ", a new term appears in the acceleration equation , causing the scale factor to accelerate or decelerate in the directions of the three fundamental lengths in a way that tends to equalise them @xcite .    in this context , the properties and implications of the twin paradox of special relativity in a multiply connected space need to be correctly understood .",
    "it has already been shown @xcite that resolving the twin paradox of special relativity in a multiply - connected `` minkowski '' space - time implies new understanding of the paradox relative to the case in simply connected minkowski space .    moreover , it is known that , at least in the case of a static space with zero levi - civita connection , multiple connectedness implies a favoured space - time splitting .",
    "this should correspond to the comoving reference frame @xcite .",
    "this could be of considerable importance to the standard cosmological model , since it would provide a novel physical ( geometrical ) motivation for the existence of a favoured space - time foliation , i.e. the comoving coordinate system .",
    "the difference between the twin paradox of special relativity in a multiply connected space relative to that in a simply connected space is that in a multiply connected space , the two twins can move with constant relative speed and meet each other a second time , _ without requiring any acceleration_. the paradox is the apparent symmetry of the twins situations despite the time dilation effect expected due to their non - zero relative speed .",
    "it is difficult to understand how one twin can be younger than the other  why should moving to the left or to the right be somehow favoured ? does the time dilation fail to occur ?",
    "as shown by several authors @xcite , the apparent symmetry is violated by the fact that ( at least ) one twin must identify the faces of the fundamental domain of the spatial 3-manifold _ non - simultaneously _ , and has problems in clock synchronisation .",
    "@xcite suggested that the apparent symmetry is also violated by an asymmetry between the homotopy classes of the worldlines of the two twins .    here , we reexamine this suggestion .    the multiply connected space version of the twins paradox is briefly reviewed in [ s - paradox ]",
    ", the question of clarifying the asymmetry is described in [ s - asymmetry ] , and a multiply connected space - time , with a standard minkowski covering space - time , and the corresponding space - time diagrams , are introduced in [ s - st - diagrams ] . in [ s - worldlines - etc ] ,",
    "the worldlines of the two twins , projections from space - time to space , homotopy classes and winding numbers are expressed algebraically .    in [ s - results ] , the resulting projections of the twins paths from space - time to space are given and their homotopy classes inferred .",
    "we also calculate whether or not the generator of the multiply connected space and the lorentz transformation commute with one another , in [ s - lorentz ] .",
    "discussion suggesting why this result differs from that of @xcite is presented in [ s - discuss ] , including a brief description in [ s - tperiodic ] of how the non - favoured twin can choose a time - limited instead of a space - limited fundamental domain of space - time .",
    "conclusions are summarised in [ s - conclu ] . a thought experiment to develop physical intuition of the non - favoured twin s understanding of the spatial homotopy classes",
    "is given in appendix  [ s - stretchable - cord ] .",
    "for a short , concise review of the terminology , geometry and relativistic context of cosmic topology ( multiply connected universes in the context of modern , physical cosmology ) , see @xcite ( slightly outdated , but sufficient for beginners ) .",
    "there are several in - depth review papers available @xcite and workshop proceedings are in @xcite and the following articles , and @xcite . comparisons and classifications of different _ observational _ strategies ,",
    "have also been made @xcite .",
    "we set the conversion factor between space and time units to unity throughout : @xmath8 .",
    "the first articles presenting the special relativity twins paradox in a multiply connected space were apparently @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are several more recent articles , including e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "consider the following description .    in a one - dimensional ,",
    "multiply connected , locally lorentz invariant space , one twin moves to the left and one to the right in rockets moving at constant relative speed to one another .",
    "the two twins meet twice , at two distinct space - time events . at the earlier space - time event ,",
    "the two twins are of equal ages . at the later space - time event",
    ", each twin considers the other to be younger due to lorentz time dilation .",
    "however , this later space - time event is a single space - time event  each twin has undergone physical aging processes . if necessary",
    ", each twin could carry an atomic clock in order to more precisely measure proper time than with biological clocks .",
    "so there can only be one ordinal relation between the two twins ages at the second space - time event : either the leftward moving twin is younger , or the rightward moving twin is younger , or the two twins are of equal age .",
    "which is correct ?",
    "there is no acceleration ( change in velocity ) by either twin , so the usual explanation of the paradox ( in simply connected space ) is invalid .",
    "however , in this case , the situation is , or at least seems to be , perfectly symmetrical .",
    "it would be absurd for either `` leftwards '' or `` rightwards '' movement to yield a younger age .    on the other hand , time dilation implies that the `` other '' twin must `` age more slowly '' .",
    "the twins physically meet up ( for an instant ) at the second space - time event , which is a single location in space - time , so the `` first '' twin objectively measures that the `` other '' twin is younger , so the two twins can not be equally aged at the second space - time event .",
    "but then which twin is `` the first '' and which is `` the other '' ?",
    "this question illustrates the apparent symmetry of the situation and the apparent implication that `` time dilation fails '' .    alternatively ,",
    "if the situation is _ not _ symmetrical and time dilation occurs as is expected , then what breaks the apparent symmetry ? why should leftwards movement by favoured relative to rightward movement , or vice - versa ?",
    "which is correct : is the situation symmetrical with a failure of time dilation , or is the situation asymmetrical with time dilation taking place ?      in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was shown that the apparent symmetry in the question as stated above is not mathematically ( physically ) possible .",
    "there is a hidden implicit assumption related to the usual intuitive error common to beginners in special relativity : the assumption of absolute simultaneity .",
    "the necessary asymmetry can be described in different ways .",
    "one way of explaining the asymmetry is as follows .",
    "one twin is able to consistently synchronise her clocks by sending photons in opposite directions to each make a loop around the universe and observing their simultaneous arrival time , and the other twin measures a delay between receiving the two photons ( or coded signal streams ) and is forced to conclude that something is asymmetrical about the nature of her `` inertial '' reference frame @xcite .",
    "carrying out this test requires a metrical measurement , that of proper time intervals .    here , in order to examine @xcite s suggestion that there is a homotopy asymmetry , i.e. an asymmetry of topology rather than an asymmetry depending on the metric , it is easier to first explain the asymmetry of the apparently symmetrical paradox in a more geometric way , similar to the presentation in @xcite , but with some additional figures .     and coordinate system @xmath9 , made multiply connected in each spatial section at constant time @xmath10 via the generator ( translation ) @xmath11 .",
    "a twin moving to the right at constant relative velocity @xmath12 ( hereafter , the `` rightmoving twin '' ) has worldline @xmath13 and simultaneity axis @xmath14 where @xmath15 , defining her coordinate system @xmath16 .",
    "space - time points a@xmath17 and a@xmath18 are identical space - time events under the generator @xmath11 , i.e. the single event may in general be called a. similarly , space - time points b@xmath17 , b@xmath18 and b@xmath19 are a single space - time event b. space - time events c and d are distinct from each other and from a and b ; c and d occur at the same spatial location for the rightmoving twin .",

    "as a covering space , this space is a standard locally and globally lorentz invariant space - time @xmath23 .",
    "we choose a generator @xmath11 which favours , arbitrarily , but without loss of generality , the leftmoving twin .",
    "this generator , @xmath11 , a translation of constant length @xmath24 with @xmath25 generates the quotient , multiply connected space , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the group generated by @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this arbitrary choice reveals where an implicit assumption was made in the presentation of the paradox above : a generator matching space - time events in a way that preserves time unchanged in one reference frame , or in other words , a generator which `` is simultaneous '' in one reference frame , is not simultaneous in other frames .",
    "hence , symmetry is not possible .    , but shown in the rest frame of the rightmoving twin .",

    "the result of identifying the other two sides of the trapezium is a cylinder .",

    "[ f - spacetimetwo ] , since the boundaries a@xmath17b@xmath18 and a@xmath18b@xmath19 now become spatial boundaries : @xmath40    cutting and pasting from the rightmoving twin s point of view must still identify identical space - time events to one another : _ either _ identifying a@xmath17b@xmath17 to a@xmath18b@xmath18 , or a@xmath17b@xmath18 to a@xmath18b@xmath19 , will correctly apply the isometry to the covering space and `` paste '' together our spatially finite interval in order to obtain a manifold without any boundaries .",

    "this visually illustrates the error in the twins paradox in a multiply connected space ( as described in [ s - paradox ] ) : _ the implicit assumption of absolute simultaneity_. if we implicitly assume absolute simultaneity , then we implicitly assume that there is no inconsistency in supposing that both twins can identify spatial boundaries without any time offsets .",
    "however , lorentz invariance is inconsistent with absolute simultaneity ; hence , the asymmetry : at most one twin can simultaneously identify spatial boundaries .",
    "of course , neither the leftmoving twin nor the rightmoving twin are necessarily favoured .",
    "a complete , precise statement of the problem needs to arbitrarily favour one twin over the other : either the leftmoving or the rightmoving twin may be chosen , but one of them must be chosen to be favoured in order for the space - time to be self - consistent .",
    "this also illustrates the potential interest for cosmology : several authors note the existence of a favoured inertial reference frame implied by the multiple - connectedness of a ( static ) space - time whose covering space - time is minkowski and that this could provide a physical motivation for the comoving coordinate system @xcite .",
    "is the apparent ( erroneous ) symmetry of the two twins situations broken by asymmetry between the homotopy classes of the two twins projected worldlines ( `` spatial paths '' ) in some way ?",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that the twin who simultaneously identifies spatial boundaries ( in this paper , the leftmoving twin ) has a spatial path of zero winding index , while the rightmoving twin has a spatial path of non - zero winding index .",

    "in fact , metric information gives an important difference between these two ( in this paper , one - dimensional ) spaces : the rightmoving twin s constant time hypersurface has a time mismatch after `` going around '' the universe once .",

    "the argument is correct in that the topologically invariant nature of winding indices is valid in _ space - time _ , but is not necessarily valid in the worldlines _ after projection from space - time to space_. the projection from an @xmath106-dimensional manifold to an @xmath107-dimensional manifold does not ( in general ) conserve all topological properties of subspaces : while a continuous projection conserves continuity , it does not conserve non - continuity .",
    "for example , consider a discontinuous path @xmath108 in the leftmoving twin s reference frame , where @xmath109 is a step function , i.e. a function discontinuous for some values @xmath110 .",
    "this projects under @xmath53 to a continuous , closed loop . similarly in higher dimensions : consider @xmath111 , which can be continuously deformed into something resembling a mess of string with the two ends tied together and not touching itself anywhere",

    "the projection will ( in general ) be a graph with many nodes , not @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , the worldlines ( e.g. those labelled 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 in fig",

    "figures  [ f - cylinderone_homotopy ] and [ f - cylindertwo_homotopy ] show that these open curves only become either a loop or a point after projection .",
    "the projection can convert a discontinuity into a continuity ( or a continuum of points into a single point ) .    in space - time , it is the union of the two twins worldlines ( two different paths in space - time from space - time event a to space - time event b ) which forms a closed curve , not either worldline alone .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - cylinderone_easy ] .",
    "this is why a `` change of coordinates or reference frame '' using a continuous function _ can _ change the winding index values of two worldlines , if those two worldlines are projections from @xmath112-space - time to @xmath106-space , considered in two different reference frames .    nevertheless , with the use of metrical information and space - time rather than just space , it is interesting to note some different possibilities of what `` space '' could correspond to if thought of as a subspace of the covering space - time @xmath23 .",

    "[ f - cylindertwo_tperiodic ] , width=302 ]    in contrast , a spacelike section of space - time at constant time for the rightmoving twin does not connect with itself : there is a time offset of @xmath115 after one loop . for a spacelike section to connect with itself",
    ", it would need to be at non - constant time .",
    "this is not a problem for topological measurements in the absence of metrical information : the rightmoving observer who sends out slow moving probes equipped with neither clocks nor rods and having speeds which can not be precisely calibrated will assume that space is @xmath62 .    in the covering space ,",
    "this could be most simply interpreted as replacing eq .",
    "( [ e - phi - r ] ) by a projection from @xmath23 to a subspace @xmath116 defined : @xmath117 in the rightmoving twin s reference frame , or equivalently , @xmath118 in the leftmoving twin s reference frame .",
    "in other words , the subspace @xmath62 of @xmath23 correspond to the rightmoving twin s interpretation of space from topological measurements alone would most easily be modelled as a spatial hypersurface of constant time for the leftmoving twin .",
    "while the rightmoving ( non - favoured ) twin making only topological measurements does not _ know _ that her `` space '' @xmath62 consists of a set of space - time points at differing times @xmath13 , the nature of what would be her constant time hypersurface , if she were able to determine it , reveals an interesting property of a multiply connected space - time for a non - favoured observer : _ the fundamental domain can be chosen by matching time boundaries instead of space boundaries .",
    "_ figures  [ f - spacetimetwoconst ] and [ f - cylindertwo_tperiodic ] illustrate this situation .",
    "the fundamental domain of this space - time can either be described as the region @xmath119 expressed as the direct product of a spatial interval as the first parameter and a time interval as the second , or as @xmath120 again with space first and time second .",
    "the former , @xmath121 , is the `` obvious '' fundamental domain , satisfying @xmath122 where the generator @xmath11 is easiest to use if expressed in the rightmoving twin s reference frame , i.e. as in eq .",
    "( [ e - generator - moving ] ) , and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , etc .",
    "the latter , @xmath125 , is the more surprising fundamental domain , satisfying @xmath126 again where @xmath11 is best expressed using eq .",
    "( [ e - generator - moving ] ) .",
    "what is surprising is that a verbal description of @xmath125 could be `` time is periodic for the non - favoured twin '' .",
    "however , this description omits important information ; a more complete description would be `` time is periodic , but with a spatial offset , for the non - favoured twin '' .",
    "in other words , the ability to choose a time - limited fundamental domain does _ not _ mean that events periodically repeat themselves from the rightmoving twin s point of view , since the generator of the periodicity does _ not _ yield an offset by a vector @xmath127 . what it yields is a space - time offset by ( an integer multiple of ) the vector @xmath128 .",
    "we could also say that for a non - favoured twin , the space - time periodicity is `` diagonal '' to the space - time axes , i.e. @xmath129",
    "finding an asymmetry in the twin paradox of special relativity in a multiply connected space is less obvious than in a simply connected space , since neither twin accelerates .",
    "it was already known that the asymmetry required is the fact that ( at least ) one twin must identify space - time events non - simultaneously and has problems in clock synchronisation .    here",
    ", space - time diagrams and the corresponding algebra have been presented in order to examine whether or not the homotopy classes of the twins worldlines provide another asymmetry .",
    "they show that homotopy classes ( numbers of windings ) do _ not _ show which of the two twins of the twin paradox has a preferred status , contrary to what was previously suggested : each twin finds her own spatial path to have zero winding index and that of the other twin to have unity winding index ( in the direction of travel of the other twin ) .",
    "although the twins apparent symmetry is broken by the need for the non - favoured twin to non - simultaneously identify spatial domain boundaries , and by the non - favoured twin s problems in clock synchronisation ( provided that she has precise clocks ) , the non - favoured twin _ can not _ detect her disfavoured state by measuring the topological properties of the two twins worldlines in the absence of precise metric measurements with clocks or rods .    on the other hand , a non - favoured twin capable of making precise metric measurements will notice many surprising properties of space - time .",
    "for example , a non - favoured twin could define the fundamental domain of space - time to be @xmath130 where the first dimension is space and the second is time . in words , time would be `` periodic with period @xmath115 and a spatial offset when matching time boundaries '' as an alternative explanation to having space be `` periodic with period @xmath63 and a time offset when matching space boundaries '' .",

    "since we are interested in topology , suppose that neither twin has _",
    "precise _ measuring rods or clocks , though both twins may have _ very approximate _ methods of measuring metric properties .",
    "neither twin is aware that when she completes a loop of the universe , she may detect a time offset .",
    "however , both twins have read history books and are aware of claims that `` space is multiply connected '' , so they attempt to verify this experimentally .",
    "we can imagine that at event a , the two twins instantaneously create a highly stretchable physical link between them , such as a light - weight string or cord of negligible mass and extremely high strength against breaking .",
    "as they move apart , the cord stretches , preserving the topological properties of space connectedness , while ignoring time .",
    "we could alternatively imagine that one of the twins leaves behind a `` trail '' of some sort , e.g. like the vapour trail of an aircraft visible by human eye from the ground .",
    "however , in this case , we have to be careful to avoid thinking of the particles in the vapour trail as being at rest in any particular frame , since otherwise we favour one of the two twins arbitrarily .",
    "now consider the state of the cord `` at '' event b , when the two twins meet up again and join the two ends of the cord together .",
    "b is a single space - time event .",
    "even though the two twins disagree about space - time coordinates of the event , they agree that it is a single event and agree that they have physically joined the two ends of the cord . clearly the cord now forms a closed loop , of winding index one .",
    "firstly , it is misleading because event b is just one space - time point among a whole set of space - time points where the particles constituting the cord are located , but `` the state of the cord '' is only of interest at this point of the discussion in the local neighbourhood of event b. it is difficult to avoid intuitively thinking of `` the state of the cord '' , i.e. of the state of a spatially extended object `` at '' the _ time _ of the event b , which is wrong , because it assumes simultaneity . a better way of thinking of the cord is presented below .    secondly , it is misleading because the word `` at '' suggests a mono - valued time coordinate for a single event .",
    "the reality is that just as in a multiply connected space , a single ( physical ) spatial point exists at many spatial points in the covering space , the situation is similar in a multiply connected space - time : a twin ( observer ) finds that a single space - time event exists at many ( in general ) non - simultaneous space - time points in the covering space - time .",
    "one twin happens to be favoured and finds that the multiple space - time copies of a single event are simultaneous , but the other twin , moving with a different velocity , has a generator which is `` diagonal '' to her space - time axes .      from the leftmoving twin s point of view , in fig .",
    "[ f - spacetimeone ] , the cord can always be considered as a simultaneous object , i.e. a series of successive `` snapshots '' of the cord consist of horizontal line segments joining @xmath73 and @xmath33 , starting at a and sliding up to a final state of @xmath133 which for the leftmoving twin , is the state of the cord `` at '' the time of space - time event b.    the rightmoving twin s point of view is similar , except that as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f - spacetimetwo ] , `` simultaneous '' snapshots of the cord , i.e. horizontal line segments joining @xmath73 and @xmath33 , starting at a and sliding upwards , have a problem when the right - hand end of the cord arrives at b@xmath18 . at this point , the left - hand end of the cord has not yet arrived at b@xmath17  according to the righmoving twin s notion of simultaneity .",
    "however , b@xmath17 and b@xmath18 are a single physical space - time event : the space - time event of joining the two ends of the cord together occurs _ non - simultaneously _ according to the rightmoving twin .",
    "this is intuitively difficult to imagine .",
    "one way that the rightmoving twin could think about this could be that `` as '' the cord slides up from event a , it tilts in some way so that when / where the two ends of the cord are joined at b , the cord can be imagined as stretched along the line segment @xmath133  along a series of space - time events which are non - simultaneous .",
    "this requires the use of some arbitrary affine parameter to define `` as '' for the rightmoving twin , i.e. a parameter that is something like time but is not physical time .",
    "of course , the simplest option for this parameter is the leftmoving twin s time coordinate , but this does not make it any easier for the rightmoving twin to develop her intuition about it .    if we consider the cord to be `` stretched '' rather than `` unrolled '' , so that the parts of the cord closest to each twin are ( nearly ) stationary with respect to that twin , and if the cord is created containing a mix of isotopes of radioactive elements in initially known proportions , then at event b , the proper times at the two ends of the cord will be measurable by measuring the isotopal mixes .    in this case",
    ", both twins will agree that not only the rightmoving twin has aged less , but also that the end of the cord `` held '' by the rightmoving twin is younger than the end of the cord `` held '' by the leftmoving twin .",
    "so although the joined - up cord forms a single closed loop , its non - simultaneous nature is revealed by the discordant ages ( isotope mixes ) of the two ends that are joined up at b.    this is dependent on the thought experimental setup requiring the cord to be locally ( nearly ) at rest with respect to each twin , i.e. the cord is `` stretched '' . with a different experimental setup for the behaviour of the cord ,",
    "the aging of the cord occurs differently , and can be calculated by studying the worldlines of the particles composing the cord .",
    "now that we have some way of seeing either twin s way of thinking of this closed loop from b@xmath17 to b@xmath18 , whose path through space ( projection of worldline to a spacelike hypersurface ) does this loop represent ?",
    "each twin considers herself to be stationary , and the other twin to be moving `` rightwards '' or `` leftwards '' , respectively .",
    "so each twin considers her own path through space to be a single point  a path of zero winding index  and that of the other twin to be a closed loop  a path of winding index unity represented by the cord .",
    "each twin considers the _ other _ twin to have pulled and/or stretched the cord so that eventually the two ends could be joined , not herself .",
    "this is just an intuitive way of thinking of the projections described above : an observer in a spatially multiply connected , locally lorentz space - time , who is unable to make high - precision spatial and temporal measurements but can measure topological properties of space is unable to use the homotopy class of her spatial path ( projected worldline ) to detect the fact that she is either a favoured or a non - favoured observer .",
    "of course , if we understand the full nature of this space - time , then we can note that the nature of `` the cord '' for at least one of the twins is a cross - section through space - time at non - constant time , as noted above .",
    "this is necessary in order for event b to be a single event in space - time .",
    "it can also to help to remember a key idea in resolving the `` pole in the barn paradox '' of simply connected minkowski space : neither a pole nor the door - to - door path of a barn is a one - dimensional object  both are _ two - dimensional space - time objects_. the `` length '' of any such object depends on the choice of the reference frame , or in other words , the choice of spacelike cross - section .",
    "yet another useful way of thinking of a pole is as a `` worldplane ''  a collection of worldlines .",
    "our ordinary intuition of a pole as a one - dimensional object is due to our implicit assumption of absolute simultaneity .",
    "we can think of the cord stretched between the two twins and joined up at event b to be the entire filled - in area of the triangle @xmath134 in figs  [ f - spacetimeone ] and [ f - spacetimetwo ]  a two - dimensional space - time object . depending on various possible",
    "thought experimental setups for creating / producing / stretching the cord , various sets of worldlines for the particles composing the cord are possible , but in each case would fill in this triangle ."
