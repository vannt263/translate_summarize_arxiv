    "a recent study @xcite suggests that efforts to model the transverse motion of vibrating beams date back to leonardo da vinci . in his discussion of the bending of beam / spring with rectangular cross - section he wrote @xcite : `` of bending of the springs : if a straight spring is bent , it is necessary that its convex part become thinner and its concave part , thicker .",
    "this modification is pyramidal , and consequently , there will never be a change in the middle of the spring '' .",
    "about hundred years after da vinci s attempt to develop a beam theory , galileo suggested an erroneous calculation of the load carrying capacity of a transversely loaded beam .",
    "da vinci did not benefit from hooke s law and calculus which postdate him whereas galileo made the incorrect assumption that under transverse loading , the stress is uniformly distributed on cross - sections . the first correct and systematic formulation of an elasticity theory was done by jacob bernoulli ( 1700 - 1782 ) .",
    "he found that the curvature of an elastic beam at a given point is proportional to the bending moment at that same point .",
    "taking advantage of his uncle seminal work , daniel bernoulli(1707 - 1783 ) derived the partial differential equation that governs the motion of a vibrating beam .",
    "leonard euler(1707 - 1705 ) pursued the study of the benoullis by using and extending their theory in his investigation of the shape of elastic beams subjected to various external forces .",
    "for a recent review of beam theories , the reader is referred to the paper by han , benaroya and wei @xcite and references therein .    in euler - bernoulli beam theory , the transverse motion of a thin non - uniform beam",
    "is governed by the partial differential equation @xmath0   + \\rho(x)\\ ; \\alpha(x){\\partial^2 u\\over \\partial t^2}=0,\\quad 0\\le x\\le l , \\label{i1}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the modulus of elasticity ( a.k.a young s modulus ) , @xmath2 is the cross - sectional area at @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the area moment of inertia of the cross - section located at @xmath3 about a neutral axis , @xmath5 is the density , and @xmath6 is the length of the beam . equation ( [ i1 ] ) is solved subject to appropriate boundary conditions at @xmath7 and @xmath8 . some common boundary conditions and their physical meaning are @xmath9 the ansatz @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the frequency of vibrations , solves eq .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) provided @xmath12 where @xmath13    under barcilon s transformation @xcite @xmath14 equation ( [ i5 ] ) becomes @xmath15+b(z)u=\\omega^2u , \\quad 0\\le",
    "z\\le   l , \\label{i6}\\ ] ] where the correct expression of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by gottlieb @xcite .",
    "save for the clamped end conditions , barcilon s transformation leaves the other boundary conditions invariant under some constraints given explicitly in @xcite . as we shall see in the sequel ,",
    "the canonical form ( [ i6 ] ) plays a crucial in inverse spectral problems associated with euler - bernoulli beams .    in many practical problems such as the structural identification through non - destructive means ,",
    "one is interested in determining the physical characteristics of the beam i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath19 from few frequencies ( spectra ) .",
    "that is , one tries to ` hear ' the shape of the beam .",
    "since the vibration of uniform beams ( i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constant functions ) is well understood , an interesting problem related to the inverse spectral problem is to find non - unform beams that have the same length and share the same spectra with the uniform beam under the same boundary conditions .",
    "this problem was comprehensively studied by gottlieb @xcite using the canonical form ( [ i6 ] ) .",
    "he found seven classes of clamped beams that are iso - spectral with the standard unit - coefficient beam ( @xmath22 ) . some of these beams where rediscovered by abrate @xcite ( see @xcite for comments ) using a different paradigm",
    ". for discrete beams , gladwell @xcite , introduced two procedures for finding iso - spectral families .",
    "his first procedure relies on shifted orthogonal matrix triangulation whereas the second utilizes toda flow .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the search of iso - spectral beams using lie symmetry methods together with a factorization method initiated by pchel and trubowitz @xcite for sturm - liouville operator . to be more precise",
    ", the factorization method for the canonical beam operator leads to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equation that we shall solve by lie s reduction method .",
    "we have organized the present paper as follows .",
    "there are four section of which this introduction is the first . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly motivate the use of factorization in the search of iso - spectral beams .",
    "the factorization approach leads to a system nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "we employ lie s symmetry theory to study its continuous symmetries in section 3 .",
    "section 4 employs the symmetries calculated in section 3 to find exact solutions of the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations derived in section 2 .",
    "this results in new families of iso - spectral beams .",
    "the main idea is to factorize the canonical beam operator as the product of a linear second - order differential operator and its adjoint , then swap the order of the operators to obtain iso - spectral operators .",
    "this idea was already used for vibrating rods by pchel and trubowitz @xcite .",
    "ghanbari @xcite attempted the factorization method on vibrating beams but failed to solve the resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "let us define the beam operator as the differential operator @xmath23 factorize the differential operator @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 + s(z ) , \\label{f3}\\ ] ] @xmath27 and @xmath28 are smooth functions of their argument , and @xmath29 is the adjoint of @xmath30 .",

    "a symmetry of a differential equation is an invertible transformation of the dependents and dependents variables that leaves the equation unchanged .",
    "the main attractive property of symmetries is that they transform solutions into solutions , and better , they provide a systematic route to integration .",
    "historically , the norwegian mathematician sophus lie ( 1842 - 1899 ) realized that determining all the symmetries of a given equation is a formidable task .",
    "however , if we restrict ourself to symmetries that depends continuously on a small parameter and that forms a group ( called an _ infinitesimal group _ in lie s terminology or lie group in modern terminology ) , it is possible to use the machinery of calculus to determine such symmetries in an algorithmic fashion .",
