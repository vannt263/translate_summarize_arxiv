    "the distance of this switching point from the saddle point of the mfep depends on many parameters of the system considered such as the diffusion length , system size , and the number of nuclei presented etc .",
    "the study of the mfep  @xcite alone can not answer this question .",
    "this switching point must also be close to the termination point of free - energy surface discovered in the @xmath0 cluster model by uline and corti  @xcite",
    ". therefore the mfep could be meaningful in the conserved system only at the early stage of nucleation for the sub - critical nucleus and , probably , only for the super - critical nucleus just over the size of the critical nucleus at the saddle point .",
    "of course , in the non - conserved system where the order parameter represents , for example , the crystallinity of the solid - liquid phase transition , the mfep will be totally meaningful up to the time when the nuclei start to coalesce  @xcite .",
    "then the kjma ( kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ) picture of phase transformation  @xcite will be valid in the non - conserved system .",
    "finally , it must be noted that the mfep is usuful only to characterize the nucleation and the evolution of a single nucleus .",
    "the nucleation in real materials may not simply be characterized by the growth of a compact isolated single nucleus .",
    "in fact , shen and debenedetti  @xcite have studied the bubble nucleation in the superheated lennard - jones fluid , and suggested simultaneous nucleation and coalescence that leads to a ramified non - compact nucleus  @xcite .",
    "non isothermal effect due to the local temperature fluctuation is also sggested to affect the nucleation process of bubble recently  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , we have to consider the heat dissipation equation coupled with the phase field equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 - 1 ] ) , ( [ eq:1 - 3a ] ) or ( [ eq:1 - 3b ] ) as those equations are considered to describe the isotheraml process .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a novel mathematical method to explore the minimum free - energy path ( mfep ) on the free - energy surface of the homogeneous nucleation using the phase - field equation for the non - conserved order parameter . by employing the local square - gradient density functional and by solving the phase - field equation for a single circular nucleus using the cell - dynamics method",
    ", we can calculate the time evolution of the size , shape , and free energy of the sub- and the super - critical nucleus .",
    "this information is used to extract the mfep of the homogeneous nucleation .",
    "the method is based on the principle in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 - 3 ] ) that the evolution driven by the phase - field equation for the non - conserved order parameter always occurs along the path on the free - energy surface along the direction to lower the free energy .",
    "more rigorous dynamical dft  @xcite or the phase - field equation for the conserved order parameter that can also satisfy an inequality similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 - 3 ] ) may not be effective to prove mfep though they can be used to study the real picture of nucleation and growth . very recently a strategy similar to ours to use the over - damped dynamics in the function space was proposed by qiu et al .",
    "@xcite where an equation similar to the phase - field equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 - 1 ] ) is used as a virtual dynamical equation for the discretized free energy to explore the mfep of the nucleation for the capillary condensation .",
