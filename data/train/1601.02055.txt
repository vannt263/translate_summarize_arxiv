    "in the early 1900 s , albert einstein proposed his now famous theory of general relativity . since its introduction , general relativity ( gr ) has been tested extensively in our solar system .",
    "gr has passed all tests with remarkable accuracy , including but not limited to the perihelion shift of mercury , the deflection of light passing near the sun , and the shapiro time delay .",
    "these tests were extended beyond the solar system with the discovery of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar where the decay rate of the orbital period was found to be consistent with the expected decay due to the loss of energy via gravitational waves ( see @xcite for a review of the subject ) . however , despite all of these successes , gr has yet to be verified in the strong gravity regime .",
    "the most extreme gravitational fields are found near black holes ( bhs ) , and tests of gr near bhs have received considerable attention ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "much of this work makes use of the no - hair theorem of gr which states that the only stationary axially symmetric solutions of the einstein equations are given by the kerr / newman family of metrics . in the case of astrophysical bhs with negligible electrical charge , the kerr solutions are parameterized by the bh s geometric mass , @xmath0 , and spin , @xmath1 .",
    "the tests of this theorem include using stars orbiting sagittarius @xmath2 , the supermassive bh in the center of the milky way galaxy , to measure its angular momentum and quadrupole moment @xcite .",
    "gravitational wave observations of merging black holes have the potential to test strong - field gr not only in the stationary , but also in the dynamic regime @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper makes use of several recently proposed metrics that contain additional terms which violate the no - hair theorem including those of @xcite .",
    "these metrics are used to quantify the degree to which spectroscopic , polarimetric , and timing x - ray observations can constrain deviations from the kerr metric .    the spectral x - ray emission from stellar mass bhs",
    "can be characterized by a thermal continuum emitted from the accretion disk along with a power law component originating from hotter - yet mostly thermal - plasma , commonly referred to as the corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the power law emission is modeled using the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the photon index @xcite .",
    "this emission can either travel directly to the observer or return to the accretion disk and lead to scattered and/or reprocessed emission .",
    "the reflection component contains the fe - k@xmath5 line at 6.4 kev and the compton hump at energies greater than 20 kev .",
    "the prominent fe - k@xmath5 line comes from the reprocessing of photons in the inner accretion disk and receives its characteristic broadened profile due to gravitational redshift , doppler effects , and relativistic beaming .",
    "this profile can then be fit to determine the bh s spin @xcite .",
    "the thermal emission , modeled using the prescription developed by @xcite for a geometrically thin , optically thick disk , can also be used to deduce the spin of stellar mass black holes because it allows one to determine the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) which is a monotonic function of its spin @xcite . in the case of supermassive black holes",
    ", the thermal disk emission falls into the optical / uv bands .",
    "as many different emission components contribute to the observed emission in these bands , fitting the fe - k@xmath5 line is the only way to determine the spin of these systems .",
    "polarimetric observations with photoelectric effect polarimeters like the ones used on the ixpe , praxys , and xipe missions currently studied by nasa ( ixpe @xcite and praxys @xcite ) and esa ( xipe @xcite ) or with scattering polarimeters such as _ polstar _ @xcite provide a new way to study inner structure of accretion flows .",
    "polarimeters can provide geometrical information even though the inner accretion flow of most black holes are too small to be imaged with the current or even next - generation telescopes ( the only exception being the supermassive black holes sgr a@xmath6 and m  87 which might be imaged with the event horizon telescope @xcite ) . in the case of stellar mass black holes , the thermal x - ray emission is expected to exhibit linear polarization with the polarization fraction being a function of the inclination of the inner accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the comptonized emission from the corona depends on the scattering processes in the corona itself and off the accretion disk .",
    "several corona geometries have been studied including the lamp - post model where photons are emitted from a point source directly above the black hole itself @xcite .",
    "other corona models assume a wedge or spherical corona geometry surrounding the accretion disk ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in the past several years",
    "x - ray reverberation has come into its own as a powerful tool to study accreting black holes .",
    "corona emission scattering off the accretion disk reaches the observer with a time delay relative to the direct corona emission .",
    "the energy dependence of the time delays can be used to infer details about the structure of the inner accretion flow . for a sample of agns , fe - k@xmath5 vs. continuum lags",
    "have been established along with compton hump vs. continuum lags ( see @xcite for a review of the subject ) .",
    "these lags can be fit with numerical models to deduce system parameters such as the inclination and lamp - post height in ngc 4151 @xcite and an extended corona geometry in 1h0707 - 495 @xcite .",
    "several authors have used the alternative bh metrics to find observational signatures of non - gr effects .",
    "the following types of observations have been studied : ( i ) fitting of the thermal x - ray emission from stellar mass black holes @xcite ; ( ii ) fitting of the fe - k@xmath5 line emission from stellar mass and supermassive black holes @xcite ; ( iii ) spectropolarimetric observations of stellar mass black holes @xcite ; ( iv ) observations of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) @xcite ; ( v ) x - ray reverberation observations @xcite ; ( vi ) observations of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow around sgr @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the studies showed that it is very difficult to observationally distinguish between the kerr space time and the non - kerr bh space times as long as the bh spin and the parameter describing the deviation from the kerr space time are free parameters that both need to be derived from the observations .",
    "several approaches have been discussed to break the degeneracy between the bh spin and deviation parameter(s ) . in @xcite , for example , it is proposed that the bh spin can be measured independently from the accretion disk properties based on measuring the jet power , although this method faces several difficulties in practice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observed results depend on the physics of the accretion disk , the radiation transport around the black hole , the physics of launching and accelerating the jet , and the physics of converting the mechanical and electromagnetic jet energy into observable electromagnetic jet emission .",
    "this paper follows up on the work of @xcite . the thermal emission from a geometrically thin",
    ", optically thick accretion disk is modeled self - consistently for the kerr metric and the alternative metrics , and observational signatures are derived with the help of a ray - tracing code that tracks photons from their origin to the observer , enabling the modeling of repeated scatterings of the photons off the accretion disk .",
    "this paper adds to the previous work by ( i ) covering the kerr metric , the metric of johannsen and psaltis ( 2011 ) @xcite and three additional metrics , ( ii ) by modeling not only the thermal disk emission but also the emission from a lamp - post corona and the reprocessing of the coronal emission by the accretion disk , and ( iii ) by considering many observational channels .",
    "we analyze the multi - temperature continuum emission from the accretion disk , the energy spectra of the reflected emission ( including the fe k-@xmath5 line and the compton hump ) , the orbital periods of matter orbiting the black hole close to the isco , the time lags between the fe k-@xmath5 emission and the direct corona emission , and the size and shape of the black hole shadows .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 begins with a summary of the alternative spacetimes used in this paper and goes on to discuss the model for both the thermal and coronal emission . in section 3",
    "we compare the observational signatures of the kerr and the non - kerr metrics finding that the observational differences are rather small given the uncertainties about the properties of astrophysical accretion disks .",
    "we summarize the results in sect .  4 and emphasize that even though the kerr and non - kerr metrics can produce similar observational signatures for some regions of the respective parameter spaces , we can use x - ray observations of black holes from the literature to rule out large regions of the parameter space of the non - kerr metrics .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath8 ; all distances are given in units of the gravitational radius , @xmath9 .",
    "as a way to test the no - hair theorem of general relativity , several non - kerr metrics have been introduced which contain additional parameters apart from the bh s mass and spin . in this paper",
    "we employ the use of four non - gr metrics including two phenomenological metrics @xcite and two which are solutions to alternative theories of gravity @xcite .",

    "overall the observational differences are very small if we adjust the accretion rate to correct for the metric - dependent accretion efficiency .",
    "the measurement of the predicted differences are very small  especially if one accounts for the astrophysical uncertainties , i.e. observational and theoretical uncertainties of the accretion disk properties . from an academic standpoint",
    ", it is interesting to compare the small differences of the predicted properties , e.g. the differences of the thermal energy spectra and the bh shadow images .",
    "the thermal spectrum of the kerr bh is slightly harder than that of the jp and kn black holes ( for the same @xmath51 ) , and the kerr bh shadow is slightly larger than that the jp and kn bh shadows .",
    "reducing the spin of the kerr bh would make the spectral difference smaller , but would increase the mismatch between the apparent bh shadow diameters .",
    "thus , in the absence of astrophysical uncertainties , the combined information from various observational channels could be used to distinguish between different metrics .",
    "although the analysis shows that the differences between the kerr and non - kerr metrics are rather subtle ( especially in the presence of uncertainties of the structure of astrophysical accretion disks ) , we can use existing observations to constrain large parts of the parameter space of the non - kerr metrics ( see also @xcite ) . as an example we use the recent observations of the accreting stellar mass black hole cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "the observations give a 3@xmath84 upper limit of @xmath85 .",
    "inspecting fig.[fig : family ] we see that the constraints on the isco can only be fulfilled for jp deviation parameters @xmath86 $ ] and kn deviation parameters @xmath87 $ ] , excluding all parameter values outside of these intervals .",
    "our limits rest on the matching of kerr to non - kerr metrics via using identical @xmath51-values .",
    "maximally rotating black holes , when a @xmath88 0.998 @xcite provide the best opportunity to test gr because observations of these systems can , in principle , be used to exclude all deviations from gr down to a small interval around 0 , limited only by the actual spin value , the statistics of the observations , and the astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "a follow - up analysis could use state - of - the - art modeling of the actual x - ray data with accretion disk and emission models in the kerr and non - kerr background spacetimes .",
    "further progress will be achieved by continuing to refine our understanding of bh accretion disks based on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and matching simulated observations to x - ray spectroscopic , x - ray polarization , and x - ray reverberation observations .",
    "the images of the bh shadow of sgr a@xmath6 with the event horizon telescope can give additional constraints . whereas the images of the bh shadow still depend on the astrophysics of the accretion disk , imaging of the photon ring",
    "would be free of such uncertainties .",
    "of course , much better imaging would be required to do so .",
