    "the present paper introduces one geometric idea and implements it in one dynamical problem .",
    "here is the problem . on the euclidean plane , a ring of identical point vortices shaped as a regular @xmath0-gon is a relative equilibrium , in that it spins while keeping the same shape .",
    "is this solution stable if we perturb the initial shape away from the regular @xmath0-gon ? when @xmath1 , linear stability analysis ( first carried out by thomson @xcite ) concludes that the solution is stable ; when @xmath2 , it is likewise unstable .",
    "but when @xmath3 , degeneracy makes linear analysis inapplicable and prevents us from concluding .",
    "is the regular @xmath4-gon stable or unstable ?",
    "this is known as the _ thomson heptagon _ problem .",
    "it has been answered in the affirmative , see @xcite , although as pointed out in @xcite the argument in @xcite is incomplete .",
    "indeed part of our approach could be viewed as completing the argument of @xcite .",
    "the spirit of the approach goes back to poincar . in the theory of dynamical systems ,",
    "the simplest solution methods to problems require some nondegeneracy condition ( nonzero determinant , nonresonant frequencies , @xmath5 ) .",
    "when the problem , call it @xmath6 , is degenerate , we have to mobilize heavy machinery ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a proof with recourse to the birkhoff normal form that the thomson heptagon is nonlinearly stable , as well as for historical details ) .",
    "but there is an alternative approach .",
    "embed @xmath7 in a parametric family @xmath8 of problems and deform it away from degeneracy . the problem @xmath6 can become tractable when regarded as @xmath9 , if we happen to understand well enough the bifurcations that occur in such a deformation",
    "thus , this approach trades one machinery for another , of bifurcation theory .",
    "the point is that the latter sometimes sheds an unusual light on the problem compared to the former .    in the classic applications of this idea",
    ", people deform the dynamical system by adding a perturbation term in @xmath10 .",
    "this , however , we can not do in our special instance of the heptagon problem if we wish to preserve the hydrodynamic motivation : as long as we are studying the dynamics on the plane , it makes little physical sense to tamper with the hamiltonian .",
    "we therefore deform not so much the dynamical system _ but rather the phase space _ on which the system evolves . a deformed choice of the phase space fixes canonically , by the hydrodynamic motivation , a deformed hamiltonian formalism .",
    "explicitly , we take @xmath10 to be the gaussian curvature to be the gaussian curvature . ] and deform the original plane to @xmath11 ( family of spheres ) and to @xmath12 ( family of hyperbolic planes ) .",
    "corresponding to this family of surfaces parametrized by @xmath10 , we must write a whole parametric family of hamiltonian systems for point vortices : a family of symplectic ( khler ) forms depending on @xmath10 , a family of symmetry groups and momentum maps depending on @xmath10 , a family of invariant hamiltonians depending on @xmath10all dependences arranged to be smooth . we do this in section 1 . in section 2",
    "we carry out the stability analysis for the parametric family .",
    "bifurcations are characterized , and the nonlinear stability of the heptagon is deduced , in section 3 .    the idea of _ deforming the geometry _ underlying the dynamics of point vortices , in particular as a route to a better understanding of the thomson heptagon problem , arose during an evening conversation between the two authors in peyresq , in the summer of 2003 .",
    "we have since discussed it in seminars and conferences , and part of it has leaked into the literature @xcite .",
    "we set down the full story in the present paper .",
    "the stability of the thomson heptagon is stated below as corollary [ coroll : thomson ] .",
    "in this section we describe the family of surfaces of constant curvature , containing the hyperbolic planes ( @xmath13 ) , the euclidean plane ( @xmath14 ) , and the spheres ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "each is a homogenous space , i.e.  an orbit of its group of symmetries , and for the different signs of @xmath10 we describe the different groups .",
    "we begin with the 1-parameter family of lie algebras @xmath16 ( rather than groups ) in section [ sec : lie algebra ] , and in order to obtain the corresponding family of surfaces @xmath17 , we shift the usual linear action of these lie algebras to obtain affine linear actions . in [ sec : surfaces ] the geometry of @xmath17 is described ; among other things it has curvature @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian for point vortices on @xmath17 is based on green s function for the laplacian on @xmath17 , and we meet three possible choices of green s function according to choices of the ` boundary condition ' . in [ sec : vorticity ] we comment on the implications of the different choices of green s function .",
