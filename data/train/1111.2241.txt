    "the study of classical , semi - classical and quantum chemical reactions on a molecular level has a rich history @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the full hamiltonian is averaged over the fast motion of the electrons , where each electron is assumed to be fixed at a specific quantum energy level ( the adiabatic approximation)@xcite .",
    "such computations produce effective potential energy surfaces ( pes ) that govern the slow motion of the nuclei .",
    "the resulting hamiltonians correspond to the _  born - oppenheimer \" _ approximations .",
    "quasi - classical computations that employ these hamiltonians provide surprisingly good approximations to the quantum calculations , hence classical models are extensively studied by chemists , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "dishearteningly , the resulting nuclei motion of even the most basic , classical  elementary \" ( bimolecular ) reactions , that are  at the heart of chemistry \" @xcite , is not well understood .",
    "numerical simulations of the nuclei dynamics exhibit sensitive dependence of the trajectories on initial conditions and parameters .",
    "moreover , one finds that macroscopic observables , like reaction rates , have an intricate dependence on the parameters and energy , see e.g. @xcite .    in contrast",
    ", the popular transition state theory provides an appealing intuitive view of this motion and leads to explicit formulae relating the microscopic nuclei kinetics to the macroscopic reaction rates .",
    "this theory assumes that the pes is separable to a one dimensional potential (  along the reaction path \" ) and a potential well in all the other modes of motion ( the bath of oscillators ) .",
    "hence , the reaction according to this theory is described by a product of a one degree of freedom ( thus integrable ) system and oscillators .",
    "this appealing phenomenological model is too simple : it does not describe the observed complex dependence of the nuclei motion on initial conditions and energy @xcite .",
    "the next level of approximation , by which the non oscillatory part of the potential is two - dimensional , is the subject of our paper . here ,",
    "the translational and vibrational energies of the atom and diatom are coupled to each other yet are separable from all the other modes of motion ( e.g. of those associated with the bending and the rotational energies ) .",
    "such a decoupling occurs , for example , when the initial configuration is collinear and the angular momentum is zero @xcite .",
    "this separability assumption is widely used in theoretical investigations of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the first examinations of the principles underlying the transition state theory were conducted by investigating such models @xcite .",
    "employing such a restrictive reduction still leaves us with a two degree of freedom system which may admit chaotic behavior ( in contrast with the transition state theory reduction which leaves us with integrable dynamics ) .",
    "one source for such complicated behavior is associated with the existence of a reaction barrier - a saddle point of the pes .",
    "the existence of such a barrier is the main ingredient needed for relating the classical transition state theory to the analysis of the phase space structure of two degrees of freedom systems @xcite .",
    "normal form analysis of the local phase - space structure near the pes bottlenecks ( local unstable extremal points of the pes ) relates these two approaches and leads to accurate calculations of the minimal flux through them @xcite .",
    "the local picture near the bottlenecks does not reveal the complexity of the motion .",
    "this complexity is revealed only when the global structure of the reaction tubes - the phase space regions that pass through the bottlenecks - is calculated @xcite .",
    "previous works on the global features of these tubes have either employed near - integrable techniques @xcite or numerical integrations @xcite . in these works",
    "it is demonstrated that the structure of the stable and unstable manifolds of unstable periodic orbits ( the periodic orbits dividing surfaces pods @xcite or , similarly , the stable and unstable manifolds of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds nhim @xcite ) determines the reaction rates . in particular , when these asymptotic surfaces intersect each other the reaction rates depend on both the intersection pattern and the local flux near the saddles . in such cases",
    "the predictions of the transition state theory ( and its local minimal flux variants ) must be modified .",
    "these insights are employed to study numerically the asymptotic surfaces to nhims of high dimensional problems @xcite .    here",
    "we introduce a new geometrical model for the two dimensional pes .",
    "the pes in the reaction region is a approximated by a sum of a quadratic form with a saddle point and a smooth potential which is close to zero within a corner region and increases sharply at the corners boundaries ( see figs [ fig : potcon]b,[fig : config ] ) .",
    "we analyze this model by combining the theory of smooth hamiltonians with impacts @xcite , the recent generalization of @xcite to the impact case @xcite , and the theory of homoclinic loops to a saddle - center @xcite .",
    "the analysis provides qualitative understanding regarding the global structure of the dividing surfaces in reactions with one rank-1 saddle point .",
    "indeed , we identify a basic mechanism which explains why and when the dividing surfaces of the periodic orbits that have energies slightly above the barrier energy are especially complicated or especially simple ( namely do not intersect each other ) . moreover , we provide a mechanism for the emergence of stable triatomic cyclic motion .",
    "the applicability of these geometrical insights to more accurate models of the pes and to higher dimensional settings ( e.g. when the two degrees of freedom dynamics are weakly coupled to a bath of oscillators ) is under current study .",
    "the paper is ordered as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall that mass - scaled jacobi coordinates bring the collinear triatomic reaction s hamiltonian to a two - degree of freedom hamiltonian in the standard mechanical form . in section 3",
    "we introduce the geometrical potential function and in section 4 we provide some basic observations regarding its properties and its relation to other potentials . in sections",

    "the stable and unstable manifolds of unstable periodic orbits with energies that are slightly above the barriers energy divide the initial iso - energetic phase space region of incoming trajectories to reacting vs non - reacting regions @xcite .",
    "the structure of the manifolds is called simple if these manifolds do not intersect each other and simply extend to the reactant and product channels .",
    "then , the phase - space transition state theory provides an accurate description of the transition rates from reactants to products . on the other hand ,",
    "if the manifolds intersect each other or fold back into the reaction region , there is no cross - section which is crossed only once by all incoming trajectories .",
    "then , the main assumption underlying the transition state theory fails @xcite .",
    "+ by introducing a geometrical model for the reaction dynamics we find conditions under which the manifolds structure is simple and conditions under which it is complicated .",
    "three qualitative observations emerge .",
    "first , we proved that a homoclinic bifurcation occurs when the manifolds are close to being perpendicular to one of the corner rays .",
    "then , there are intervals of energies at which stable periodic triatomic configurations emerge .",
    "second , we found that when the projection of the unstable eigenspace to the configuration space intersects the lower corner ray in an obtuse angle ( so @xmath579 ) , and , additionally , the saddle - center expansion rate is much larger than the oscillation frequency , the manifolds geometry is simple ( conjecture [ thm : sd2 ] ) .",
    "third , we established that provided the unstable eigenspace direction intersects the corner rays , the manifolds are trapped for sufficiently large oscillation frequency ( theorems [ thm : compupper],[thm : complower ] ) .",
    "+   + we expect that similar qualitative statements may be formulated when nonlinear normal form and higher dimensional extensions are included .",
    "namely , that conditions under which phase - space transition state theory is adequate for describing the reaction for energies that are close to the saddle energy may be found by a similar methodology . more generally , while the effects of non - linear terms in the reaction region have been suppressed here for simplicity of presentation ( by taking only quadratic terms of the integrable normal form and by considering small @xmath68 ) , we trust that the main principles that were discovered hold for the nonlinear case as well ; indeed , once the fixed point @xmath153 has the saddle - center structure , its stable and unstable manifolds may be computed . with a general non - linear smooth potential their projection to the configuration space",
    "will appear as curved lines that may or may not intersect the corner region boundary .",
    "the analysis presented here applies to the case where , in the limit system , the manifolds do hit the boundary and reflect back .",
    "then , we expect to find similar behavior in terms of the hill region dependence on the ratio between the oscillatory and the hyperbolic eigenvalues .",
    "finding the implications of the above observations for specific chemical reactions is an interesting and challenging endeavor - we believe the tools developed here may shed some light regarding the governing parameters .",
    "finally , we note that the analysis presented here applies to the traditional energy regime in which the behavior near the barrier is examined .",
    "the behavior for larger energies , or equivalently , for reactions that do not have a barrier , is expected to be quite different and will be described elsewhere .",
    "indeed , we hold that there are two distinct mechanisms that give rise to the observed sensitive dependence of the reaction rates on the energy and the initial conditions : those associated with the complicated structure of the manifolds as discussed here and those associated with the corner geometry of the nearly - billiard hamiltonian .",
