    "cooperative effects in the radiative behavior of atoms stored in a trap may arise from their mutual dipole - dipole interaction if the atoms are close enough to each other .",
    "this is particularly interesting for two or three atoms and has attracted considerable interest in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , the present authors investigated in detail the transition from antibunching to bunching for two two - level systems with decreasing atomic distance @xcite",
    ".    for a single multi - level system with a metastable state one has the striking phenomenon of macroscopic dark periods , or electron shelving , in which the electron is essentially shelved for seconds or even minutes in a metastable state without photon emissions @xcite-@xcite . for two such systems their fluorescence behavior would ,",
    "without cooperative effects , be just the sum of the separate photon emissions , with dark periods of both atoms , light periods of a single and of two atoms . in ref .",
    "@xcite the fluorescence intensity of two and three such ions in a paul trap was measured and a large fraction of almost simultaneous jumps by two and even all three ions was recorded .",
    "this fraction was orders of magnitudes larger than that expected for independent ions .",
    "a quantitative explanation of such a large cooperative effect has been found to be difficult @xcite , and we will briefly discuss this question again in the last section .",
    "other experiments at larger distances and with different ions showed no cooperative effects @xcite .",
    "a numerical approach to the study of double jumps faces the problem that for good statistics one needs very long simulation times .    as a simpler indicator of cooperative effects for systems with light and dark periods we propose here to use the mean durations , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , of the three different types of fluorescence periods , i.e. dark , single - intensity , and double - intensity periods , respectively .",
    "the running time can be much shorter than required for double jumps , making these quantities easily accessible , both experimentally and in simulations .",
    "in this paper we therefore present a study of cooperative effects on the mean durations of the three types of fluorescence periods of two three - level @xmath0 systems with a metastable state , as a function of their distance @xmath4 .",
    "the level scheme of a single @xmath0 system is depicted in fig",
    ". 1 @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that the mean durations of the single- and double - intensity periods , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , depend sensitively on the dipole - dipole interaction and thus on the atomic distance @xmath4 .",
    "they exhibit marked oscillations which decrease in amplitude when @xmath4 increases .",
    "these oscillations seem to continue up to a distance of well over five wavelengths of the strong transition where we have stopped our simulation .",
    "the real part of the dipole - dipole coupling constant of the two @xmath0 systems also exhibits damped oscillations . as a remarkable fact",
    "we find that these oscillations are in phase with those of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this correspondence is easy to understand intuitively since the real part of the dipole - dipole coupling constant enters the decay rates of the excited states of the combined two - atom system .    in section",
    "ii we explain the methods employed which are based on the quantum jump approach @xcite-@xcite ( equivalent to the monte - carlo wavefunction approach @xcite and to quantum trajectories @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is here adapted to two dipole - interacting @xmath0 systems .    in section iii",
    "we define in more detail the three types of fluorescence periods of zero , single and double intensity .",
    "this involves an averaging procedure , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "we then present the results of our simulations .    in section iv",
    "the numerical results are interpreted , and it is shown that one can associate three distinct subspaces of states of the coupled system with the three types of fluorescence periods . during each period",
    "the coupled system remains in the corresponding subspace . in section",
    "v we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "in the quantum jump approach @xcite , the time development of an atomic system is described by a conditional non - hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath5 , which gives the time development between photon emissions , and by a reset operation which gives the state or density matrix right after an emission . for a general @xmath6-level system these",
    "have been derived in refs . @xcite .",
    "the derivation is adapted here for a system consisting of two atoms .",

    "_ reset matrix_. now we determine the reset operation which gives the state or density matrix right after a photon detection .",
    "let the state of the combined system , atoms plus quantized radiation field , be given at time @xmath58 by @xmath68 , i.e. the atomic system is described by the density matrix @xmath69 and there are no photons ( recall that the laser field is treated classically ) . if at time @xmath70 a photon is found by a non - absorptive measurement the combined system is in the state @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the projector onto the one or more photon space ( since @xmath33 is in the above range and thus small one could directly take the projector onto the one - photon space ) .",
    "the probability for this event is the trace over eq .",
    "( [ 210 ] ) . for the state of the atomic system",
    "it is irrelevant whether the detected photon is absorbed or not ( intuitively the photon travels away and no longer interacts with the atomic system ) .",
    "hence after a photon detection at time @xmath70 the non - normalized state of the atomic system alone , denoted by @xmath73 , is given by the partial trace over the photon space , @xmath74 we call @xmath75 the non - normalized reset state @xcite .",
    "proceeding as in refs . @xcite and",
    "using perturbation theory one obtains @xcite @xmath76 the normalized reset state is @xmath77 . by eq .",
    "( [ 210 ] ) the normalization of @xmath78 is such that tr@xmath79 is the probability for a photon detection at time @xmath70 when the ( normalized ) state of the atomic system at time @xmath58 is @xmath69 .",
    "the laser field does not appear in the reset state , just as in the case of a single atom @xcite , since its effect during the short time @xmath33 is negligible .    by a simple calculation one checks that eq .",
    "( [ 212 ] ) can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 if @xmath69 is a pure state , @xmath82 say , then @xmath83 are also pure states .",

    "( [ 212 ] ) to a new density matrix ( which has to be normalized ) , and so on .    the decomposition of @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ 213 ] ) allows one , however , to work solely with pure states which is numerically much more efficient .",
    "one can start with a pure state @xmath54 , develop it with @xmath89 until @xmath90 to the ( non - normalized ) @xmath91 , reset to one of the pure states @xmath92 with relative probabilities given by the factors @xmath61 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ 213 ] ) , and so on .",
    "the waiting time distributions are not changed by this procedure .",
    "for a single atom in a @xmath0 configuration the existence of dark periods is due to two widely different time scales in the times between two subsequent photon emissions ( cf . , e.g. , refs .",
    "the smaller time scale , @xmath93 , is of the order of @xmath94 , while the larger time scale , @xmath95 , is the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath96 for a single atom .",
    "one can pick a time , @xmath97 , say , with @xmath98 , and if the time between two subsequent photon emissions is longer than @xmath97 one may then define this as a dark period .",
    "the mean duration of such dark periods is essentially independent of @xmath97 , if chosen as above , and is given by @xmath95 .",
    "when the waiting time between two photons is less than @xmath97 the atom is said to be in a light period .",
    "the average intensity in a not too short light period is that of a driven two - level system , i.e. in our case the 1 and 3 levels .    if one has two independent , _ noninteracting _ , atoms the combined fluorescence is just the sum of the individual contributions . when both atoms are in a dark period one has a dark period of the combined system .",
    "if only one atom is in a dark period one observes a fluorescence period with intensity of that of a single two - level atom ( single - intensity period ) , and if both atoms are radiating one observes a double - intensity period .",
    "however , due to fluctuations in the emission times the latter two periods are not sharply defined if the atoms are so close to each other that one can not determine from which atom a particular photon came . to distinguish the periods",
    "one has therefore to use an average photon intensity , obtained by means of an averaging time @xmath99 .",
    "this @xmath99 has to be large enough so that the photon intensity doubles when both atoms are not in a dark period .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath99 is chosen too large one may overlook short fluorescence periods , and one will see more seemingly direct transitions between dark periods and double intensity periods ( double jumps ) . the analytic treatment of fluorescence of two independent atoms is easily obtained from the single - atom case @xcite .    for two _ dipole - interacting _ atoms which are sufficiently close to each other the photons",
    "can not be attributed to a particular atom , either , and one has to consider the two interacting atoms as a jointly radiating system . to be able to differentiate between different fluorescence phases one again",
    "has to average the photon numbers over a time interval @xmath99 to arrive at an intensity , and in the following we present the results of numerical simulations which have been obtained by the methods explained in section ii .",
    "_ atomic distances of a few wavelengths_. fig .",
    "3 shows the number of emitted photons per time @xmath94 , averaged over a time interval @xmath100 . if the atomic distance is larger than a third of a wavelength of the fast transition , @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102 , one can clearly distinguish three types of fluorescence periods , dark periods ( 0 ) , single - intensity periods ( 1 ) , and double - intensity periods ( 2 ) . for two noninteracting atoms these would correspond to radiation of no atom , one atom , and two atoms , respectively",
    ". however , in the case of interaction and small distance the system of two atoms radiates as a whole , and in general one can not attribute periods 1 and 2 to radiation of individual atoms as in the noninteracting case .",
    "the transition between the periods occurs rapidly but not instantaneously .",
    "the duration of the periods is long compared to the atomic time scale . from a sufficiently long trajectory",
    "one can obtain the average lengths of the periods , denoted by @xmath103 and @xmath3 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath104 of laser 2 , which drives the weak atomic 1 - 2 transitions , has been chosen in such a way that for independent atoms one has @xmath105 .",
    "as seen in fig . 4 , @xmath1 is essentially independent of the atomic distance and thus of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "in contrast to this the two light periods are strongly distance dependent . in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) , @xmath3 varies between @xmath106 and @xmath107 and a similar behavior is also seen in fig . 4 ( b ) .",
    "the curve for @xmath2 resembles that for @xmath3 , except for smaller relative variation .",
    "there is an interesting correspondence between the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with that of @xmath108 . as seen from a comparison of figs .",
    "4 and 5 the variations with @xmath4 of all three quantities seem to be in phase . for @xmath64",
    "the variation is out of phase , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath108 influences the decay rates of the two - atom systems , this in - phase behavior suggests that the variation in the lengths of periods 1 and 2 are due to an @xmath4 dependence of the decay rates .",
    "_ small atomic distances_. our simulations have shown furthermore that for @xmath109 the intensity in period 2 decreases and no longer reaches that of two simultaneously radiating independent atoms .",
    "for very small distance only periods 0 and 1 remain .",
    "the reason for this will be discussed below .",
    "for a single atom ( in a @xmath0 configuration as in fig .",
    "1 ) one can associate light and dark periods with certain atomic states and density matrices . during a dark period the atomic state",
    "rapidly approaches the eigenstate of @xmath5 with smallest imaginary part of the eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "this eigenstate is very close to @xmath110 , up to terms of order @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "thus , in a dark period , the atom can be regarded to be approximately in the state @xmath113 . during a light period",
    "the atom can be regarded to be in the equilibrium state ( density matrix ) of the 1 - 3 subsystem driven by @xmath114 , again up to terms of the above orders @xcite .",
    "a jump from one fluorescence period to the other corresponds to a transition between these atomic states , and such a transition is caused by laser 2 . with @xmath115 and @xmath116 there would be no transitions .",
    "this correspondence clearly carries over to the three fluorescence periods of two independent atoms .",
    "we are now going to suggest a similar correspondence between fluorescence periods and states for two dipole - interacting atoms .",
    "6 depicts the dicke states of the two - atom system ( see eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) ) .",
    "dashed arrows indicate the weak driving by laser 2 , solid arrows indicate strong driving by laser 3 and decay , respectively .",
    "now , for @xmath115 , i.e. no dashed arrows , the states in fig .",
    "6 decompose into three non - connected subspaces , namely one spanned by @xmath45 and the two others spanned by the four inner and outer states , respectively : @xmath117 if the two atoms are in state @xmath45 then each of them is in its dark state , and thus no photon can be emitted . for @xmath115 ,",
    "the time development in subspace 1 is exactly the same as that for a system of two noninteracting atoms in the same subspace of states .",
    "this can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) and it is also physically obvious since two atoms can only interact via photon exchange if none of them is in the dark state @xmath47 .",
    "the photon rate for subspace 1 is therefore that of a single two - level atom with levels 1 and 3 .",
    "subspace 2 corresponds to the level scheme of a system of two dipole - dipole interacting two - level atoms ( with levels 1 and 3 ) , as for example recently discussed in ref .",
    "the photon rate of this system is , in good approximation , twice that of a single two - level atom , provided @xmath118 . for smaller atomic distance",
    "the photon rate rapidly decreases to zero , due to the increasing level shifts .",
    "if the two - atom system has been in one of the subspaces 0 , 1 , or 2 , it will quickly approach the corresponding equilibrium state for driving @xmath114 and distance @xmath4 . if @xmath119 the additional weak driving will , from time to time and in analogy to a single v system , cause transitions between the three subspaces 0 , 1 , and 2 , and each transition will correspond to a jump in the fluorescence .",
    "thus the fluorescence periods 0 , 1 , and 2 should correspond to ( the equilibrium states of ) the subspaces 0 , 1 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "this is verified by the numerical evaluation in fig",
    ". 7 . in the lower part of fig . 7 a particular realization of an intensity trajectory with alternating periods of fluorescence is plotted .",
    "the three upper curves show the populations of the three subspaces corresponding to this realization , obtained by the conditional hamiltonian and reset matrix of section ii .",
    "the agreement between fluorescence periods 0 , 1 , 2 , and subspaces 0 , 1 , 2 is striking . during dark periods",
    "the two - atom system is in the subspace 0 , and similarly for periods 1 and 2 .",
    "this correspondence , however , depends to some extent on how large @xmath99 is chosen for the averaging of photon counts .",
    "if @xmath99 is chosen too large one can overlook some jumps between subspaces and some very short fluorescence periods .",
    "if @xmath99 is chosen too small there may be large intensity fluctuations , resulting in an incorrect determination of the different periods .",
    "if the atomic distance decreases below @xmath120 the level shifts of @xmath65 and @xmath67 by @xmath64 increase rapidly .",
    "this renders the driving by laser 3 within the subspace 2 much less efficient .",
    "hence for very small atomic distances the driving is essentially restricted to subspace 1 .",
    "this explains the vanishing of double - intensity periods for very small atomic distances .",
    "cooperative effects of driven two three - level atoms have been studied , where each individual atom can exhibit light and dark periods .",
    "the atoms were considered to be a fixed distance @xmath4 apart .",
    "if @xmath4 is of the order of a few wavelengths of the fluorescent light the individual photons are no longer attributable to a particular atom and the two - atom system radiates as a whole , due to the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "in addition to dark periods the system shows two types of light periods , one with fluorescence intensity as if only a single atom were radiating , and the other with double intensity .",
    "we have proposed to study the mean duration , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , of the two types of light periods as a quantity sensitively depending on the dipole - dipole interaction and thus on the atomic distance .",
    "experimentally and numerically these quantities are easily accessible .",
    "we have performed fluorescence simulations for atomic separations of up to 5 wavelengths and have found oscillations in @xmath2 and @xmath3 of up to 40% in amplitude .",
    "the amplitude decreases with the atomic separation but the oscillations seem to continue for separations larger than 5 wavelengths . by simulations",
    "we have shown that the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is in phase with that of the real part of the dipole - dipole constant .",
    "this is eminently reasonable since @xmath108 directly influence the decay rates of the excited states of the two - atom system .",
    "we have associated the three types of fluorescence periods with certain subspaces of states for the two atoms and to equilibrium states in these subspaces .",
    "the equilibrium states depend on the driving of the strong transition and on the distance .",
    "the weak driving then causes transitions between the subspaces .",
    "the transition rates depend not only on the weak driving , but also on the form of the respective equilibrium states and thus on the strong driving and on the atomic distance .",
    "in contrast to the mean durations of the light periods the mean duration of the dark periods is practically independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this is intuitively quite clear since in the dark state there is essentially no photon exchange and thus no induced dipole - dipole interaction .    to define fluorescence periods one has to average the number of photon emissions over a time interval @xmath99 of a some finite length .",
    "hence very short fluorescence periods are washed out and not observed , and this can lead to apparent direct transitions between double - intensity periods and dark periods , or vice versa , so - called double jumps . experimentally these have been seen in ref .",
    "the cooperative effects of up to 40% found by us in the duration of the single - intensity and the double intensity periods are noticeable .",
    "therefore we expect that also the frequency for the appearance of double jumps is modified by the dipole - dipole interaction , but we can not predict whether the changes are of the two orders of magnitude reported in ref . @xcite . besides , the system in ref .",
    "@xcite differs from the one considered here , and it is not obvious if and how our results would carry over to that system .",
