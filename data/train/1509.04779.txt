    "<S> we present a method of performing high - speed rotational anisotropy nonlinear optical harmonic generation experiments at rotational frequencies of several hertz by projecting the harmonic light reflected at different angles from a sample onto a stationary position sensitive detector . the high rotational speed of the technique , @xmath0 to @xmath1 times larger than existing methods , permits precise measurements of the crystallographic and electronic symmetries of samples by averaging over low frequency laser power , beam pointing , and pulse width fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the sensitivity of our technique by resolving the bulk four - fold rotational symmetry of gaas about its [ 001 ] axis using second harmonic generation .    rotational anisotropy nonlinear harmonic generation ( ra - nhg ) is an all - optical technique for determining the crystallographic and electronic symmetries of solids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been successfully applied to study a variety of phenomena , including lattice reconstruction on semiconductor thin film surfaces @xcite and metal / electrolyte interfaces @xcite , magnetic ordering on metal surfaces and buried multilayer interfaces @xcite , magnetic ordering in bulk semiconductors @xcite and multiferroics @xcite , and molecular self - assembly on dielectric substrates @xcite . in the ra - nhg technique , </S>",
    "<S> a laser beam is focused onto a sample and the intensity of light reflected or transmitted at a higher harmonic of the incident frequency is measured as a function of the angle @xmath2 between the scattering plane and some crystalline axis parallel to the surface of the sample while a fixed angle of incidence is maintained [ inset fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ] . by selectively measuring different combinations of incoming and outgoing light polarizations , </S>",
    "<S> typically linearly polarized either in ( @xmath3 ) or out of ( @xmath4 ) the scattering plane , the independent non - zero elements of the nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor of the sample can be deduced . by neumann </S>",
    "<S> s principle , this serves to identify the crystallographic and electronic point group symmetries of the sample under study @xcite .         </S>",
    "<S> demonstration of polarization compensation by a dichroic mirror pair . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) polarization - dependent transmittance curves of dm1 and dm2 were measured using a photodiode positioned after dm2 with both pm and l1 removed . </S>",
    "<S> data were acquired by stepping the polarization angle @xmath2 in @xmath5 increments and averaging for @xmath6 sec per data point . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted intensity of 800 nm light through ( b ) only dm1 , ( c ) only dm2 , and ( d ) both dm1 and dm2 are displayed as a function of @xmath2 . also shown </S>",
    "<S> are fits to @xmath7 for the individual mirrors and a constant for the mirror pair . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations of the data about the fitting functions are due primarily to low frequency laser power fluctuations during acquisition . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars show the rms deviation of the data from the fits . ]    </S>",
    "<S> ra - nhg experiments are typically carried out by rotating the sample while keeping the scattering plane fixed . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach in which the scattering plane is rotated while the sample is kept fixed has also recently been demonstrated , which is advantageous when studying small samples and when low temperatures or externally applied fields ( e.g. magnetic , electric , strain ) are desired @xcite . in both methods , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is stepped and held at discrete values for a finite wait time while the high harmonic intensity is recorded . </S>",
    "<S> a major drawback of this method of data acquisition is the long time required ( of order @xmath0 sec ) to complete a full 360@xmath8 sweep of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces a large amount of low frequency noise in the data from temporal fluctuations in laser power , beam pointing , and pulse width , limiting the ultimate precision with which point group symmetries can be determined . </S>",
    "<S> it also precludes accurately measuring temporal changes in the ra - nhg response of a sample that occur on the timescale of a @xmath2 rotation period , which may arise from processes such as charge migration or impurity adsorption on the sample surface under vacuum conditions @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate a novel high - speed ra - nhg setup using a position sensitive detector that rotates @xmath2 at a frequency @xmath0 to @xmath1 times higher than conventional methods @xcite , which can in principle be increased to even higher frequencies .    a schematic layout of the high - speed ra - nhg setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> unless otherwise stated , all optical components are standard and were obtained from thorlabs , inc . </S>",
    "<S> the setup operates in the following way : a circularly polarized laser beam , produced from a linearly polarized beam using a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) , first passes through a linear polarizer ( lp1 ) and a fused silica binary phase mask ( pm ; tessera technologies , inc . ) </S>",
    "<S> that are mechanically co - rotating about the beam axis . </S>",
    "<S> the polarizer produces a beam of constant intensity with a rotating linear polarization that is maintained either parallel or perpendicular to the pm groove direction depending on whether an @xmath9 or @xmath10 polarization geometry at the sample is required . </S>",
    "<S> the phase mask splits the beam into many diffracted orders , each retaining the polarization set by lp1 and sweeping out a cone as the pm rotates . for our measurements , </S>",
    "<S> only the @xmath11 order is utilized while all other orders are blocked . </S>",
    "<S> next , a collimating lens ( l1 ) and an achromatic objective lens ( l2 ) form a telescope that focuses the beam onto the surface of the sample , thus creating a rotating scattering plane . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental and higher harmonic beams reflected from the sample return via the diametrically opposite side of l2 upon which they are re - collimated . </S>",
    "<S> they then pass through a linear polarizer ( lp2 ) that is co - rotating with both lp1 and pm , which is used to select either the @xmath12 or @xmath13 polarization component of the reflected beam . </S>",
    "<S> the desired harmonic is finally isolated using tilted dichroic mirrors ( dm2,3 ; semrock , inc .  </S>",
    "<S> brightline series ) and spectral filters ( sf ) that direct it onto a cooled electron - multiplying ccd camera ( ccd ; andor technology ltd . ) . </S>",
    "<S> as lp1 , pm , and lp2 rotate , the reflected beam sweeps out a circle on the two - dimensional active area of the ccd , thereby recording the angular @xmath2-dependence of the nhg signal as a position dependent intensity on the ccd . to eliminate any possibility of mechanical phase slip between lp1 , pm , and lp2 during rotation , </S>",
    "<S> they are coupled to a common axle driven by a single 12 v dc electric motor with a pulse - width modulating power controller . </S>",
    "<S> the need to rotate only three lightweight optical elements allows for rotation at high speeds ( @xmath14 hz or more ) , which is greater than previous setups that rotate the detector @xcite by a factor of @xmath0 to @xmath1 and much faster than the characteristic timescale for laser fluctuations and drift . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , because the value of @xmath2 read from the ccd image is rigidly tied to the angle of the pm , the experiment is insensitive to random phase slips of the motor .    </S>",
    "<S> the key component of our high - speed ra - nhg setup , enabling the use of a stationary detector , is the triple dichroic mirror periscope ( dm1 - 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this consists of three identical long - pass dichroic mirrors with a cut - on edge wavelength between that of the fundamental and desired harmonic , each mounted at 45@xmath8 with respect to the direction of beam propagation , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . to illustrate the function of this periscope , </S>",
    "<S> we first study its effect on the fundamental beam by measuring the intensity transmitted through dm1 , dm2 , and both mirrors as a function of the incident linear polarization angle @xmath2 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) ] . as @xmath2 changes </S>",
    "<S> , the polarization incident on a dichroic mirror that is rotated by 45@xmath8 about the vertical axis varies continuously between @xmath4 and @xmath3 with a @xmath15 periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> the transmittance through dm1 therefore varies sinusoidally in accordance with the fresnel equations , as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) . in order to compensate for this unwanted effect </S>",
    "<S> , the beam is sent through a second dichroic mirror ( dm2 ) that is tilted by 45@xmath8 about the horizontal axis , which has a transmittance curve that is @xmath15 out of phase with the first mirror [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the combined effect of dm1 and dm2 is to completely eliminate any net polarization dependence of the transmittance [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](d ) ] and thereby maintain a constant @xmath2-independent incident intensity on the sample . the combination of dm2 and dm3 acts in a similar way in reflection geometry to eliminate any net polarization dependence of the outgoing high harmonic beam . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the acquisition time for each curve shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] is approximately 10 minutes . on this timescale , characteristic low frequency laser fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> are clearly observed through the deviations of the data away from the fitted curves and the mismatch of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 data points . </S>",
    "<S> it is precisely these types of fluctuations that are averaged out by the high - speed ra - nhg setup .    to characterize the performance of our ra - nhg setup , we measured the rotational anisotropy of second harmonic generation ( shg ) from the ( 001 ) crystal surface of gaas . for the incident </S>",
    "<S> light source we used a regeneratively amplified ti : sapphire laser system ( kmlabs wyvern 1000 ) that produces 60 fs optical pulses ( broadened to @xmath18 fs at the sample by dispersion ) with 800 nm center wavelength and operates at a 10 khz repetition rate . </S>",
    "<S> the dichroic mirrors were selected to have a cut - on wavelength of 635 nm . at a rotation frequency of @xmath19 4 hz , the angular spacing between successive pulses is @xmath20 , which is much smaller than the angular subtense of each beam spot on the ccd ( @xmath21 ) and therefore allows the incident beam to be treated as quasi - cw . </S>",
    "<S> raw ccd images of the ra - shg data ( 400 nm wavelength ) from ( 001 ) gaas obtained in a @xmath10-@xmath12 geometry are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](a ) for a series of short continuous camera exposure times . </S>",
    "<S> a ring of intensity with alternating nodes and antinodes separated by 45@xmath8 is already clearly visible after 1 sec , which demonstrates a rotationally anisotropic shg response of the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the ccd images can be cast into a form more conducive to quantitative analysis by performing a radial integration ( after background subtraction ) with respect to an origin centered on the ring of intensity and binning the data into fixed @xmath2 azimuthal intervals . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig3](b ) shows the integrated intensity of both the 5 sec and 20 sec images as a function of @xmath2 on a polar plot , which exhibit four lobes of equal amplitude consistent with previously reported ra - shg measurements on the ( 001 ) gaas surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the data are also well described by the expression @xmath22 expected under @xmath10-@xmath12 geometry , where @xmath23 is a linear combination of bulk and surface electric dipole induced shg susceptibility tensor elements derived from the @xmath24 symmetry group of gaas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a closer examination of the data reveals a high degree of overlap between data points taken at different exposure times , which demonstrates the high level of precision achievable using our technique and shows that the minor deviations of the data away from the ideal @xmath22 form are due to systematic sources of error such as misalignment and sample surface quality rather than statistical sources of error such as laser fluctuations .    in summary , we have demonstrated a novel technique based on position sensitive detection to perform ra - nhg experiments at rotational frequencies @xmath0 to @xmath1 times higher than existing methods . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency can in principle be pushed much higher using a more powerful motor @xcite , which would further suppress low frequency noise arising from laser fluctuations and allow increasingly sensitive measurements of point group symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this technique can be applied in both reflection and transmission geometries and can be extended over a wide photon wavelength range , limited primarily by the spectral range of the ccd . </S>",
    "<S> it is also amenable to ultrafast time - resolved pump - probe ra - nhg measurements through the use of short laser pulses and the introduction of a pump beam , which can be used for example to separate electronic relaxation pathways @xcite or to study photo - induced symmetry breaking phase transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time resolution of such experiments can be improved by replacing the transmissive objective l2 with a reflective cassegrain objective to reduce dispersive pulse broadening , and sensitivity to small pump - induced changes in nhg intensity can be enhanced with a lock - in camera .    @xmath25 these authors contributed equally to this work . </S>"
