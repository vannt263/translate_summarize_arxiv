    "in the experiment the functional molecule n , n-bis(1-naphthyl)- n , n-diphenyl-1,1-biphenyl-4,4-diamine ( npb , a molecule widely used for organic light emitting diodes ) , has been used @xcite .",
    "this molecule was deposited on a silica surface . to create an attractive region for the molecules ,",

    "the gold grid is acting as an adsorbing environment for the central area of the squares .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : exp_fig ] left , one cluster is created with a well - defined position in the center of the cell . due to the regularity of the grid the clusters also form a regular structure .",
    "with increasing the flux the number of clusters increases , i.e. nucleation control is no longer present .",
    "we use a three dimensional cubic lattice model with a lattice constant of @xmath2 .",
    "it is the same model as described in @xcite .",
    "every lattice site @xmath3 can be occupied by three different particle types : deposited particles @xmath4 , substrate particles @xmath5 and the more attractive pre - pattern particle @xmath6 ( in the experiment represented by gold ) .",
    "the lattice site @xmath7 is either filled or empty .",
    "as we are only interested in the dynamics of the deposited particles the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath8 where the @xmath9 are the interaction parameters .",
    "@xmath10 depends on the distance @xmath11 between the particles on position @xmath7 and @xmath12 and represents the distance scaling function .",
    "it is defined as follows :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     strictly speaking the value of @xmath13 depends on the coverage of the surface . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fignvsml_l100 ] ( top ) the diagram @xmath13 against the coverage in monolayer ( ml number of particles per full surface coverage ) is shown for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "the respective values for the corresponding flux values are listed in tab.[tab : none_data ] .",
    "interestingly , when expressing the time in terms of the coverage , one observes no major dependence on the length or the flux , respectively . as a consequence the doubling of the flux gives rise to a doubling of the nucleation rate under the condition of an appropriate choice of the new length to guarantee @xmath15 .",
    "the exponential fit , also shown in fig .  [ fig : fignvsml_l100 ] ( top ) , works quite well for a coverage larger than 0.2 ml . in this regime",
    "the nucleation rate is independent of time .",
    "note that in the long - time regime for a coverage over 1.5 ml the value of @xmath13 reaches a plateau , i.e. no new clusters are formed . of course , the individual clusters are still growing . as a consequence ,",
    "the value of @xmath13 , determined for a coverage of 2.0 ml , is very well defined and insensitive on the chosen coverage .",
    "the exponential fit does not work for low coverage .",
    "a detailed analysis of the short - time behavior , however , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath16 and @xmath17 on average more than 11 clusters are created per cell ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fignvsml_l100 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "almost all nucleation proceeds before 0.1 ml are deposited .",
    "the curve displays a maximum at 0.4 ml and slightly decreases for longer times , indicating some coarsening effect which , however is small .",
    "here we repeat the recently published @xcite key ideas to understand the effect of varying the grid the length @xmath14 for fixed flux @xmath18 . for an individual simulation run",
    "we always restrict ourselves to times before a cluster forms .",
    "this helps us to capture the conditions for the formation of the first cluster .",
    "we start by considering the particle density distribution @xmath19 under the condition that no nucleation has occurred until time @xmath20 , i.e. no increase of the local density due to nucleation occurs .",
    "thus we can apply a continuum approach based on burton - cabrera - frank theory for the case of complete condensation @xcite @xmath21 the pre - pattern grid acts as an adsorbing boundary , written as @xmath22 the solution for the stationary regime @xmath23 can be expressed in terms of a fourier series .",
    "we get @xmath24 with the numerical value @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath26 is dominated by the single term @xmath27 for which @xmath28 displays a significant maximum in the center of the cell .",
    "the density @xmath29 at this maximum reads @xmath30 to obtain a density @xmath19 from the simulation results we use the projection of the three - dimensional deposited particle distribution onto the surface plane @xmath31 . if the position @xmath32 is occupied by a deposited particle we choose @xmath33 , otherwise @xmath34 .",
    "the density @xmath35 is then defined as the ensemble average of @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath36    at ( 2,-0.1 ) coverage ; ( 0,0 )  ( 4,0 ) ; ( 0,0 )  ( 0,3 ) ; at ( -0.5,0.85 ) @xmath37 ; ( 0,0 ) sin ( 2,2 ) ; ( 2,2 )  ( 4,2 ) ; ( 0,2 ) node[left ] @xmath38  ( 3.2,2 ) ;    in ref.@xcite the time - dependence of @xmath39 , obtained from simulations , has been analyzed in detail .",
    "note again , that only those realizations contribute for which until time @xmath20 no nucleation process has occurred ( _ cluster - free subensemble _ ) . for the interesting case @xmath15 a sketch of the time - dependence",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_form_schema ] . its long - time limit agrees very well with the calculated value of @xmath40 ; see eq .",
    "[ eq : num_sum ] .",
    "we denote this value by @xmath38 .",
    "it has an important interpretation when interpreting simulations with a different value of @xmath14 . for smaller @xmath14 , implying @xmath41 cluster formation is strongly suppressed , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , in the opposite limit many clusters start to grow as soon as @xmath39 approaches @xmath38 . thus , the stationary regime is never reached because of preceding nucleation events . as a consequence @xmath38",
    "can be interpreted as the density where nucleation suddenly sets in . since the nucleation rate scales with a high power of the density ( depending on the size of the critical nucleus ) , this observation is not surprising .    as a consequence of this interpretation",
    "it comes out quite natural that for @xmath15 the nucleation process occurs close to the center of the cell ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_fig ] , since only for a small spatial regime one has @xmath43 .      on a purely theoretical",
    "basis one can estimate the flux - dependence of the critical density @xmath38 . according to standard nucleation theory @xcite the local nucleation rate scales like @xmath44 if @xmath45 denotes the critical nucleation size .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "[ eq : stat_sol ] the spatial dependence is given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . as a consequence , the spatial range close to the center , where cluster formation can occur , i.e. @xmath48 , is proportional to the total area @xmath49 .",
    "thus , for the interesting case @xmath15 one obtains for the total nucleation rate @xmath50 the possible flux - dependence is explicitly indicated .",
    "of course , this relation only holds under the condition that no nucleation has occurred so far .    as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fignvsml_l100 ] the growth of nuclei , if plotted against the coverage , does not depend on the flux . as an immediate consequence one has the simple scaling @xmath51 ,",
    "i.e. when doubling the flux and appropriately modifying the length @xmath14 to keep @xmath15 also the total nucleation rate will become twice as large . from eq .",
    "[ eq : num_sum ] it follows that there is an direct relation between the chosen length scale @xmath14 and the flux @xmath18 .",
    "choosing @xmath52 one explicitly keeps track of the flux dependence in order to keep @xmath53 constant . inserting both relations into eq .",
    "[ eq : gammatot ] one gets @xmath54 and thus @xmath55 with @xmath56 as an immediate consequence one can predict how one has to vary the grid size @xmath14 in order to keep @xmath15 when varying the flux . in general eq .",
    "[ eq : num_sum ] yields @xmath57 . together with eq .",
    "[ eq : rhof ] this yields @xmath58 with @xmath59 as a matter of fact we end up with the same argumentation given by ranguelov",

    "@xcite , who used a similar ansatz to analyse the island creation on stepped surfaces .",
    "the resulting scaling exponent of @xmath60 is in accordance with island density scaling , one would expect on homogeneous substrate for complete condensation @xcite .",
    "one experimental goal is to generate a structure where ideally in every cell there is exactly one cluster which , furthermore , is located directly in the center of the cell .",
    "this would correspond to ideal nucleation and position control , respectively . in what follows",
    "we compare the nucleation and position control from the simulations with the experiments .",
    "we always consider the case @xmath15 .",
    "first , to check the quality of nucleation we determined the standard deviation of @xmath13 , which is shown in fig .",

    "]    it turns out that the quality of the nucleation control from the simulations is independent of the chosen @xmath63-pair .",
    "a standard deviation of 0.2 together with an average value of unity means that in approx .",
    "95% of all cells there is indeed a single cluster , compare table [ tab : none_data ] , whereas in the remaining cells there is the same number of cells with no or two cluster .",
    "the independence from @xmath14 just reflects the scaling properties , discussed above .",
    "thus , after rescaling the time- and length scale the nucleation behavior is basically identical .",
    "it is very promising that the standard deviations , seen experimentally , are very close to the simulated ones .",
    "this shows that indeed the lattice model represents the key properties of the nucleation behavior of the actual molecules .",
    "the fluctuations as a function of @xmath14 are much larger than expected from statistical reasons .",
    "experimentally , reasons for fluctuation of experimental data could be related to a slightly uncontrolled coverage and contamination on the substrates .",
    "full width at half maximum of the center of mass distribution corresponding to the center of the cell @xmath64 scaled by the cell size @xmath14.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    second , to analyse the position control we identify for each cluster the center of mass and then analyse the spatial distribution of these centers . naturally , this distribution has its maximum in the middle of the cell . in the next step",
    "we determine the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . due to the scaling arguments ,",
    "already discussed above , we expect that this width should scale with @xmath14 . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhmvsl ] , the ratio fwhm/@xmath14 is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "again , simulations and experiments basically displays the same values . furthermore this ratio is quite small which is a quantitative confirmation that not only nucleation control but also position control works very well .",
    "as discussed in sect . [ sec : flux_dep_rho ] the key observable to characterize the underlying flux dependence of the cluster formation is the observable @xmath38 .",

    ", we can not determine the exact critical cluster size .",
    "nonetheless this shows that the scaling in general is not limited to a specific regime of condensation .",
    "it is known from nucleation theory that the number of clusters in the stationary long time limit on a plain substrate is a function of @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the diffusion constant @xcite . in the present case",
    "this would correspond to the limit of large @xmath13 where the influence of the boundaries hardly matter . from our theoretical approach to nucleation control ( eq . [ eq : num_sum ] ) we also expect a perfect @xmath80 scaling for @xmath82 .    here",
    "we check whether this scaling with @xmath80 indeed holds for the large range of @xmath13-values . for this purpose",
    "we vary the values of @xmath81 and @xmath18 individually .",

    "[ fig : fignvsdof ] we show the average number of stable clusters @xmath13 against @xmath87 .",
    "average number of clusters versus @xmath87 for different values of the diffusion parameter as indicated in the figure and the corresponding flux @xmath18 .",
    "the flux is scaled by factor @xmath88.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    note that a perfect scaling is observed for all values of @xmath13 . as a practical consequence",
    ", we can always choose @xmath84 in order to optimize the efficiency of the mc simulations but nevertheless cover all possible diffusion constants .",
    "finally we look at the scaling of @xmath13 for a fixed flux @xmath16 and different cell sizes @xmath14 following the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_fig ] . the data is shown in fig .  [ fig : nscale ] .    nscale_l.eps ( 18,38 ) cluster number scaling against the effective nucleation area for a fixed flux @xmath16 . in the inset",

    "the error bars represent the standard deviation .",
    "the solid line represents a power law with a slope of one.,title=\"fig : \" ]    is it possible to judge from which system size the boundary conditions only have a minor impact on the nucleation behavior ? without boundaries one would expect the simple scaling @xmath90 . for fixed flux values",
    "we show the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : nscale ] , both for the simulation and the experimental data .",
    "interestingly , both data set display a similar slope in the double logarithmic representation .",
    "it is , however , larger than two .",
    "these deviations have to do with the fact that nucleation can only occur in the center of each cell .",
    "the area , where nucleation is possible , is denoted as @xmath91 .",
    "we define it as the area of a circle with the full width and half maximum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fwhmvsl ] ) as diameter , determined for the specific values .",
    "plotting @xmath13 as a function of @xmath91 , indeed yields a slope of one , starting from @xmath13-values as small as 2 .",
    "thus , the number of clusters is extensive for @xmath92 and the boundary effect is just reflected by the presence of a zone where no nucleation can take place .",
    "based on a new experimental way to generate a regular array of clusters , possibly formed by functionalized organic molecules , we have studied this boundary - induced nucleation control from a theoretical perspective . in particular",
    "we have compared the experimental data with the outcome from kinetic monte carlo simulations .",
    "more specifically , we have analyzed the quality of nucleation and position control , the flux vs. length - dependence to guarantee the presence of a single cluster per cell and the dependence of the number of clusters on the effective growth area . in all cases",
    "we have obtained a very good agreement between experiment and simulation .",
    "this work constitutes another example that analysis of a simple lattice model indeed captures many properties of the cluster formation of complex molecules .    furthermore , via comparison with analytical expressions for the stationary concentration profile in the cluster - free sub - ensemble and employing key results of nucleation theory , the flux vs. length - dependence can be fully understood .",
    "it is important to mention that most properties result from surprisingly simple scaling relations . of key importance",
    "is the proportionality of the nucleation rate and the external flux , giving rise to a universal behavior how the number of cells with one cluster increases with increasing coverage . actually , this universality was the major ingredient to connect the analytical and the numerical / experimental pieces of information .",
    "we hope that combined experimental and theoretical analysis of boundary - induced nucleation control and the observed generality of this approach may inspire more work along this line .",
    "possible extensions such as the simultaneous use of different molecules are conceivable .",
