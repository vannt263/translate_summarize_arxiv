    "the @xmath0 collider , hera , operated from 1992 - 2007 with protons of energy @xmath1 @xmath2 and electrons or positrons of energy @xmath3 . by the end of the running , each of the colliding - beam experiments , h1 and zeus , had collected about @xmath4 of data .",
    "different kinematic variables are used to describe @xmath0 interactions : the virtuality of the exchanged boson , @xmath5 , the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath6 , and the inelasticity , @xmath7 . at hera , two kinematic regimes are distinguished depending on @xmath5 : photoproduction ( @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 , and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , where @xmath10 .    in the following a small selection of recent measurements of jets and heavy quark production in @xmath8 and dis at hera",
    "is presented .",
    "at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath11 , jet production in neutral current ( nc ) dis , can be described via the boson - gluon fusion and qcd compton processes . in @xmath8 ,",
    "two processes are relevant : the direct process , in which the photon interacts as a point - like particle , and the resolved process , in which the photon interacts through its partonic content .",
    "measurements of jet production in @xmath8 and nc dis provide a powerful tool for stringent tests of pqcd calculations . in recent analyses ,",
    "jet production was measured at hera in different kinematic regions . in these analyses jets",
    "were defined using the @xmath12 clustering algorithm .",
    "for dis , the jet algorithm was applied in the breit frame , in which the photon and proton collide head on , and for @xmath8 , in the laboratory frame .",
    "the measurements from the zeus collaboration include the dijet cross section in @xmath8  @xcite ( @xmath13 ) and inclusive - jet cross sections in @xmath8  @xcite ( @xmath14 ) and high @xmath5 dis  @xcite ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the h1 measurements include inclusive , 2-jet and 3-jet cross sections as well as the ratio of 2-jet to 3-jet cross sections for low @xmath5  @xcite ( @xmath16 ) and high @xmath5  @xcite ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "for the latter , the jet cross sections were normalized to the inclusive dis cross section , which significantly reduces the experimental and theoretical errors .",
    "figure  [ fig : multijets ] shows the dijet cross section as a function of @xmath18 in @xmath8 and inclusive - jet cross sections as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in dis .",
    "the data are very precise , the dominant experimental error being the energy scale of the jets in the zeus measurements and the model dependence of the data correction in the h1 measurement .",
    "the measurements are compared to next - to - leading ( nlo ) qcd predictions which describe the data very well .",
    "the theoretical errors are dominated by the renormalization scale uncertainty .",
    "the dijet cross sections have the potential of constraining further the proton and photon pdfs and the inclusive - jet cross sections provide direct sensitivity to @xmath21 .",
    "the jet cross sections described above were used to extract the value of @xmath11 and to test its running .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha_summary ] ( left ) shows a summary of recent @xmath21 measurements from the h1 and zeus collaborations together with the hera averages of 2004  @xcite and 2007  @xcite and the current world average  @xcite .",
    "all measurements are consistent with each other and with the world average . for many of the measurements the theoretical uncertainties dominate the error .",
    "higher order calculations are expected to improve the results .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath11 was determined by extracting @xmath11 at different values of the scale .",
    "statistical , systematic and correlated uncertainties were taken into account .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha_summary ] ( right ) shows the running of @xmath11 as a function of the renormalization scale , where the values were extracted from the h1 data at low and high @xmath5 .",
    "the measurements at low @xmath5 agree well with the qcd expectations for @xmath11 based on the jet cross section measurements at high @xmath5 .",
    "in @xmath23 collisions , the main production mechanism for heavy flavors is the boson - gluon fusion process .",
    "the large mass of the heavy quarks produced in this process and large @xmath5 ( in case of dis ) or @xmath24 of the heavy quark ( in case of @xmath8 ) provide hard scales , so that pqcd is applicable .",
    "several different experimental techniques are used to tag the heavy quark final state .",
    "these methods include identification of a lepton which is produced in the semileptonic decay of heavy quarks ( lepton tag ) , exploiting the lifetime information using the impact parameter or decay length ( lifetime tag ) and meson identification ( e.g.  @xmath25 tagging ) .",
    "different tagging methods often cover different kinematic regions and can be combined to enhance the separation between signal and background .    in a recent zeus measurement  @xcite , the semileptonic decay of @xmath26 hadrons into electrons",
    "was combined with lifetime information .",
    "this analysis was performed in the dis regime ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the extraction of the beauty signal was done using a likelihood - ratio test , which allowed information on electron identification to be combined with the semileptonic decay kinematics .",
    "the beauty production cross sections were measured in bins of @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the beauty contribution to the proton structure function was calculated .",
    "the measured cross sections were found to be in good agreement with the scaled rapgap lo mc prediction and nlo qcd predictions calculated from the hvqdis program .",
    "the h1 collaboration has recently released a new measurement  @xcite of @xmath30 meson production in dis ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "single and double differential cross sections were determined and compared to different mc models and nlo qcd predictions .",
    "in general all cross sections were found to be reasonably well described by different lo and nlo qcd predictions .",
    "two preliminary results from the zeus collaboration on beauty production in @xmath8  @xcite ( @xmath32 ) and dis  @xcite ( @xmath33 ) , used inclusive secondary vertices associated to jets .",
    "the beauty content was determined by a @xmath34 fit of the mirrored decay length significance distribution in bins of invariant mass of the secondary vertex .",
    "r0.39        the beauty photoproduction cross section as a function of @xmath35 compared to nlo qcd prediction from fmnr and the scaled lo pythia is shown in figure  [ fig : php_xsec ] .",
    "the measured cross sections are in reasonable agreement with the nlo qcd prediction and their shape is well described by lo mc prediction .",
    "h1 measurements of cross sections for events with charm and beauty jets in dis  @xcite ( @xmath36 ) were also presented .",
    "the numbers of charm and beauty jets were determined using variables reconstructed using the h1 vertex detector .",
    "the measurements were compared with qcd predictions and with previous measurements .",
    "these measurements showed that the production of beauty and charm jets in dis is reasonably well described by nlo qcd predictions .",
    "the data from beauty production in dis using the electron decay channel and inclusive secondary vertexing was used to extract the beauty contribution to the proton structure function @xmath38 , denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2b_f2c ] ( left ) shows @xmath39 as a function of @xmath5 for fixed values of @xmath6 .",
    "the results from two recent zeus measurements has been compared with the previous measurements from h1 and zeus .",
    "the different measurements are consistent with each other .",
    "also the results are compared to several nlo and nnlo qcd predictions .",
    "the data are reasonably well described by the different theory predictions .",
    "the h1 and zeus combined @xmath40 was obtained by combining several different measurements made using different tagging techniques  @xcite .",
    "the correlations of the systematic uncertainties between the different measurements were taken into account .",
    "the data covered the kinematic range of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "a precision of @xmath43 was reached for the combined results .",
    "the results were compared with different approaches of pqcd .",
    "the comparison with different predictions ( see figure  [ fig : f2b_f2c ] ( right ) ) shows that in most of the @xmath6@xmath5 plane the data are more precise than the spread observed in the theoretical predictions .",
    "the @xmath40 data represents therefore valuable constraints on the theory of heavy flavor production in dis .",
    "a selection of results of recent measurements for jet and heavy flavor production in @xmath8 and dis at hera was presented .",
    "jet physics at hera provide high precision qcd measurements .",
    "these measurements can help to constrain further the proton and photon pdfs .",
    "precise and consistent @xmath11 extraction in different kinematic regimes has been performed .",
    "the running of the coupling is verified over a wide range of the scale .",
    "the measured cross sections for beauty and charm production are in general consistent with the nlo qcd predictions .",
    "the different measurements provide a consistent picture of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
