    "the lyman forest in qso absorption spectra is now generally believed to be due to absorption by large - scale neutral hydrogen ( ) density fluctuations of moderate amplitude in a warm photoionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this relatively new paradigm for the ly@xmath1  forest differs considerably from the conventional `` cloud '' picture which had been advocated for two decades and in which the lyman forest is due to a superposition from discrete absorbers with small cross sections ( see rauch 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the new picture picture had been investigated using analytical calculations ( e.g. bond , szalay & silk ; mc gill 1990 ; bi , brner & chu 1992 ) but was only generally accepted after the coherence length of the absorbing structure could be measured accurately and turned out to be of order several hundred kpc ( dinshaw et al .",
    "1994 , e.g. bechthold et al .",
    "the picture was then further sustained by ( hydrodynamical ) cosmological simulations of gas in dark - matter dominated universes ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; petitjean , mcket & kates 1995 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .  1996",
    "; miralda - escud et al .",
    "important results of these simulations are a tight correlation between the  and the dark matter distribution ( on scales larger then the jeans length of the igm ) and a simple temperature - density relation for the igm which depends only on the reionization history of the universe ( e.g. hui & gnedin 1997 , haehnelt & steinmetz 1998 ) .    as a consequence of this new picture",
    "the lyman forest can be used to probe the distribution and clustering of dark matter at high redshift .",
    "for example , bi & davidsen ( 1997 ) have developed a simple analytic model for the igm to generate artificial qso absorption spectra for a variant of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogony .",
    "they were able to reproduce the characteristic properties of observed absorption spectra .",
    "croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that absorption spectra provide important information on the shape and the amplitude of the power spectrum of mass fluctuations .",
    "croft et al .",
    "used the following procedure .",
    "they first obtained a linearized flux distribution by applying the gaussianization scheme proposed by weinberg ( 1992 ) .",
    "they then inferred the shape of the linear power spectrum of dark matter density fluctuation from the power spectrum of the linearized flux and used mock spectra from numerical simulations to determine the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "gnedin & hui ( 1998 ) used mock spectra generated from simulations of collisionless particles run with a particle - mesh code modified to mimick pressure effects of the gas to investigate the effect of amplitude and the power spectrum of dark - matter fluctuations on the column density distribution of ly@xmath1   absorption systems .    in this paper a complementary approach is taken .",
    "we propose to use an analytical model of the igm for a direct inversion of the absorption features in qso spectra .",
    "this approach has the advantage that no particular cosmological model has to be assumed .",
    "furthermore , the actual real space density along the los and its probability distribution can be studied and a direct link to other observations is posssible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the assumed model for the lyman absorption .",
    "section 3 presents the inversion algorithm for recovering the _ real _ space dark matter ( dm ) density along the l.o.s . , concentrating on the ly@xmath1  forest . in section 4",
    "we test the inversion procedure with mock spectra generated from numerical simulations of collisional dark matter and show how to estimate higher order moments of the density probability distribution and ( @xmath0   ( the parameter combination of baryonic density @xmath2 , ionizing flux @xmath3 and hubble constant @xmath4 which determines the mean flux level in qso absorption spectra ) . in section 5 we discuss possible applications and give our conclusions .",
    "absorption spectra are normally presented in the form of a normalized flux which ( neglecting noise and instrumental broadening ) can be related to the optical depth as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the optical depth , @xmath7 is the redshift space coordinate , @xmath8 is the observed flux and @xmath9 is the flux emitted from the quasar which would be observed without intervening absorption and has to be estimated from the data as well .",
    "the optical depth in redshift space due to resonant ly@xmath1  scattering is related to the neutral hydrogen density , @xmath10 , along the line - of - sight ( l.o.s ) in real space as ( gunn & peterson 1965 , bahcall & salpeter 1965 ) @xmath11   \\dd x , \\label{tau}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the effective cross section for resonant line scattering , @xmath4 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the real space coordinate ( in @xmath15 ) , is the voigt profile normalized such that @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the l.o.s .",
    "peculiar velocity , and @xmath18 is the doppler parameter due to thermal / turbulent broadening . for moderate optical depths the voigt profile",
    "is well approximated by a gaussian , @xmath19 .",
    "assuming that hydrogen is highly ionized and in photoionization equilibrium ( @xmath20 ) we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the neutral hydrogen density at mean total gas density and @xmath23 ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "the second relation assumes that the gas density traces the dark matter density . at the low densities considered here",
    "shock heating is not important ant the gas is at the photoionization equilibrium temperature .",
    "the doppler parameter can then be related to the total gas density and temperature as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the temperature at the mean density and @xmath26 ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "combining equation ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we get @xmath27 \\dd x\\ ] ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the baryonic and total matter density in terms of the critical density and @xmath31 is the photoionization rate per hydrogen atom ( @xmath31 is related to the flux of ionizing radiation @xmath32 as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the hydrogen absorption cross section ) . to obtain the second relation in equation ( 6 )",
    "we have have taken @xmath35 for the hydrogen recombination coefficient , @xmath36 as the effective cross section for resonant ly@xmath1  scattering and used the high redshift approximation for the hubble constant , @xmath37 .",
    "the proposed scheme for recovering the l.o.s .",
    "density from the flux is motivated by lucy s method ( lucy 1974 ) . in order to demonstrate the method",
    "let us , for the time being , consider the case where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath40 this is a linear integral equation with a positive kernel @xmath41 \\sigma_{0}\\ , c / h(z)$ ] and can be solved for @xmath10 using lucy s iterative method .",
    "this is done in the following way .",
    "divide @xmath7 into equal bins of size @xmath42 ( the data are actually given in bins of @xmath7 anyways ) and set @xmath43 .",
    "provide an initial guess for @xmath44 , say @xmath45 .",
    "denote the values of @xmath44 at the @xmath46th iteration by @xmath47 and evaluate the sum @xmath48 where @xmath49 \\;\\frac{\\sigma_{0 } \\ ; c}{h(z)}.\\ ] ] the @xmath50th estimate of @xmath44 is then @xmath51\\ ; \\frac { \\sum_j ( f_j / f^r_j)\\tilde g_{ij } } { \\sum_j \\tilde g_{ij } } \\label{iter } , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is some kernel which in principle may be chosen to be different from @xmath53 .",
    "lucy s method , however , uses @xmath54 .",
    "the averaging over @xmath55 adjacent bins mitigates the effect of noise in the data .",
    "we work with @xmath56 .",
    "now we generalise the iteration scheme to the case where @xmath6 is not necessarily small . in this case , the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath6 is nonlinear .",
    "however , since the relation is monotonic , we can still use a modified version of equation ( [ iter ] ) , @xmath58 \\label{iterfnl } .\\ ] ]    how do we decide when to stop the iterations ?",
    "suppose that in the @xmath59th bin , the 1-@xmath60 error in the measurement of @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "let us define the quantity @xmath63 we choose to stop at the @xmath64th iteration when the value of @xmath65 drops below the number of data bins .",
    "it implies that the observed flux is consistent with being a noisy realisation of the reconstructed flux .",
    "we write ( [ tau ] ) in terms of the redshift coordinate @xmath66 , instead of @xmath14 .",
    "if the coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath67 are related by a one - to - one mapping , then the velocity and the real space coordinate , can be expressed uniquely as functions of the redshift coordinate @xmath67 .",
    "working with @xmath67 , equation ( [ tau ] ) takes the following form @xmath68\\left[1-\\frac{\\dd \\vp(s)}{\\dd s}\\right ]   \\ ; \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & &   { \\cal h } [ w - s , b(s-\\vp(s ) ) ] \\dd s \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{taus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for brevity , we have maintained the same notation for the peculiar velocity as a function of @xmath67 . according to the continuity equation , the density in redshift space , @xmath69 , is related to the density in real space by @xmath70 \\left[1-\\frac{\\dd \\vp(s)}{\\dd s}\\right ] .",

    "the parameter @xmath73 depends on @xmath74 implicitly via @xmath75 . because @xmath73 is a weak function of @xmath75 , we assume that @xmath73 is constant in the reconstruction algorithm",
    "this will greatly simplify the application of the algorithm .",
    "tests of the algorithm , however , are done using mock spectra generated with varying @xmath73 according to equation ( [ doppler ] ) .    to relate the  density to the matter density we use equation ( [ nhi ] and ( [ tauf ] ) .",
    "we still need to know the value of  to obtain @xmath76",
    ".  has been estimated by adjusting the mean flux of mock spectra generated from hydrodynamical simulations to match the mean flux of observed qso absorption spectra ( rauch et al .",
    "the accuracy and possible biases of this determination have not yet been investigated in detail ( see also weinberg et al .",
    "1997 ) , but we consider the value of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ( @xmath0 ) to be presently known with about 30 percent accuracy . for most of the paper",
    "we therefore assume that we know the value of  . in section 4.3 we show how the value of @xmath79 ( @xmath78 ( @xmath0 ) can be estimated directly from the distribution of the recovered quantity @xmath80 by assuming a parametric form for the probability distribution of the matter density .      the correction for redshift distortions requires knowledge of the velocity field .",
    "the 3-dimensional velocity and mass density fluctuations are tightly related .",
    "however , non - linear velocity - density relations which are easy to implement generally relate real space quantities , as does the relation ( [ nhi ] ) between the  and matter density .",
    "we have therefore to resort to an iterative procedure to derive the real space matter and  densities from the estimated redshift space  density .",
    "two issues need to be stressed here : ( i ) the velocity field is not uniquely specified by the l.o.s .",
    "density field but influenced by the unknown 3d matter distribution , and ( ii ) redshift distortions can and do result in multi - valued zones where regions which do not overlap in real space are mapped onto the same redshift coordinate . in appendix",
    "a we describe a method which resembles wiener filtering and addresses the first point .",
    "it allows us to obtain the most probable velocity field which is consistent with the estimated l.o.s .",
    "dm density field and has the statistical properties of a gravitationally clustering gaussian random field of a given power spectrum . in principle",
    "the power spectrum can also be determined from the recovered density field but for simplicity we have chosen to adopt a power spectrum a priori .",
    "the results do not change much for reasonable choices of the assumed power spectrum .",
    "multi - valued zones mainly occur in regions of high density where the inversion is difficult due to saturation effects in the spectrum .",
    "we did not try to correct for this effect , but discuss some of the biases introduced by peculiar velocities in section 4 .",
    "the iterative scheme to correct for redshift distortions which we have adopted can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "assume that the redshift - space and real - space   density are equal and use ( [ nhi ] ) to compute the matter density field along the l.o.s .",
    "2 .   estimate the peculiar velocity along the l.o.s . using the method described in the appendix .",
    "3 .   use the estimated peculiar velocity field to correct for redshift distortions in the density field .",
    "4 .   use the corrected density field to obtain a better estimate for the peculiar velocity field .",
    "repeat steps ( ii)-(iv ) until convergence is achieved .",
    "the scheme proved to be efficient ; it typically converges after a few iterations .",
    "iterative schemes of this kind have been used for correcting redshift distortions in galaxy redshift survey ( e.g. yahil et .",
    "al . 1991 ) .",
    "ideally one would like to test the method with a large high - resolution hydrodynamical simulation of gas and dark matter .",
    "however , simulations of collisionless particles are still vastly superior in dynamical range and especially speed .",
    "we have therefore chosen to test our inversion algorithm with a high resolution n - body simulation of pure collisionless dark matter particles where we used the relations in section 2.1 to obtain the  distribution from the smoothed dark matter density field .",
    "as demonstrated e.g. by gnedin ( 1998 ) such a procedure results in a realistic   distribution ( apart from the high - density regions which are not of interest here ) .",
    "the simulation used was run on the cray t3e parallel supercomputer in garching with a modified version ( macfarland et .",
    "1997 ) of couchman s @xmath81 code ( couchman et .",
    "al . 1995 ) .",
    "the initial conditions were generated from the power spectrum for a standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe with @xmath82 and @xmath83 cubic box of comoving length of @xmath84 .",
    "the simulation was normalised such that the linear @xmath85 density fluctuations in a sphere of @xmath86 was 0.5 at redshift @xmath87 .",
    "the softening parameter was @xmath88 of the mean particle separation and the mesh size was @xmath89 in one dimension .",
    "we have generated mock spectra from velocity and density fields along lines of sight randomly drawn from the simulation box .",
    "we used the output of the simulation at two redshifts , @xmath90 and @xmath87 , to investigate the effect of varying the fluctuation amplitude of the density field .",
    "we emphasize here that the mock spectra generated from the simulation at @xmath87 are not meant to resemble absorption spectra at @xmath87 .",
    "the density and velocity fields in the simulations show significant variations in structure and amplitude at the two redshifts and the @xmath87 spectra are investigated with the same mean flux as the @xmath90 spectra in order to test the inversion algorithm under varying conditions .",
    "reliable velocity and density fields can not be derived from the simulation on scales much smaller than the mean particle separation .",
    "we therefore applied gaussian smoothing of widths @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , to the outputs of the simulation at @xmath90 and @xmath87 .",
    "both smoothing scales correspond to the same physical scale ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the @xmath85 values of the smoothed density fluctuations were @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the density of neutral hydrogen was assumed to follow the relation ( [ nhi ] ) with @xmath96 .",
    "the absorption optical depth was computed according to equation ( [ tau ] ) , ( [ nhi ] ) , and ( [ doppler ] ) with @xmath97 .",
    "for both redshifts the value of  was adjusted so that the mean normalized flux of a large ensemble of mock spectra was 0.69 ( about the observed mean flux at @xmath90 as determined by rauch et al .  1997 ) .",
    "the spectra were convolved with a gaussian of 8km / s fwhm to mimick instrumental broadening and photon / read - out noise was added with a total s / n=50 per 3km / s pixel .",
    "the solid curve in the top panel of fig.1 is a mock spectrum generated from the simulation output at @xmath90 .",
    "the dotted curve is the same spectrum with the peculiar velocities set to zero .",
    "the peculiar motions do not only introduce a systematic shift but also a narrowing of the absorption features ( see also weinberg et al .",
    "1998 for a discussion of this point ) . furthermore",
    ", unsaturated lines get deeper due to the enhanced clustering in redshift space .",
    "the mean flux is also affected . for constant",
    "it increased from 0.66 to 0.69 including peculiar motions while the rms flux fluctuations increased from 0.31 to 0.35 .",
    "figure 2 shows some typical results of our inversion procedure . in the top panel",
    "a mock spectrum is plotted ( solid line ) together with the spectrum corresponding to a recovered density and peculiar velocity field ( dotted line ) .",
    "the smoothness of the dotted curve demonstrates that our inversion procedure succeeds in mitigating the noise in the data ( which for clarity is shown separately at the bottom of the panel ) .",
    "let us now have a look at the dm density field recovered from a mock spectrum generated with no peculiar velocities as shown in the middle panel of figure 1 . in this case",
    "the correspondence is excellent up to densities where the absorption features become heavily saturated ( for ly@xmath1  absorption at a overdensity of about  3 at @xmath90 . without peculiar velocities our inversion procedure works as well as we could reasonably expect .",
    "the obvious way to extend the inversion procedure to regions of higher density would be to use the higher order lyman series lines which have smaller effective absorption cross sections and therefore saturate at increasingly higher densities ( cowie , private communication ) .",
    "however , as we discuss below peculiar velocities significantly affect the quality of the recovered density field , especially in high density regions .",
    "the incorporation of higher order lyman series lines in the inversion procedure will therefore be difficult and we leave this to future work .",
    "the second panel of fig .  2 shows the dm density field recovered from a mock spectrum generated with peculiar velocities but before correcting for redshift distortions . as expected the correspondence between true and recovered density",
    "is degraded compared to the case where the spectrum was generated with the peculiar velocities set to zero .",
    "the main features of the density field are still recovered but there is a significant shift between true and recovered density in real space and there of course remains the systematic underestimate of the density in saturated regions .",
    "the third panel shows the reconstructed density for our full iterative procedure including the correction of redshift distortions as described in section 2.4 .",
    "the shift between true and recovered density in real space is reduced and the overall correspondence has significantly improved .",
    "this indicates that we succeed in removing a major fraction of the redshift space distortions .",
    "the recovered and true l.o.s .",
    "velocity fields are shown in the bottom panel . in all cases shown",
    "we have used the correct value for , i.e. the value used to generate the mock spectrum .",
    "it should have become clear in this section that peculiar velocities significantly influence the quality of the recovery .      for a statistical analysis of the recovered density field we will use the probability distribution function in differential ( pdf ) and cumulative form ( cpdf ) .",
    "let us for the time being still assume that the true value of  is known .",
    "we will discuss how  can be estimated from the pdf of the recovered density field in the next section .",
    "3 shows the cpdf for the true and recovered dm density field for the simulations at @xmath90 and @xmath87 . at low densities",
    "both curves correspond very well but the deviations become large at high densities due to saturation effects which confirms the visual impression from figure ( [ flux : sim ] ) and ( [ los : sim ] ) .",
    "we further quantify the differences between the cpdfs of true and recovered density field in terms of a number of moments of the density distribution in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the bias in the recovered density introduces large discrepancies between the estimated and true values of the moments .",
    "for example , the mean and rms values estimated at @xmath87 are : 0.614 and 0.608 ; instead of the true values : @xmath98 and @xmath95 .",
    "what we would like to have is a simple parametric form for the pdf of the dm density .",
    "this could then be used to correct for the biases in the recovered density field .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. kofman et .",
    "1994 , coles & jone 1991 . )",
    "that the pdf of the density field of a gravitationally clustering gaussian random field in the mildly non - linear regime is well described by a _",
    "log - normal _ pdf . in that case",
    "the quantity @xmath99/\\mu_2",

    "( [ pdf : sim ] ) we compare the pdf of the dm density in the simulations ( filtered with gaussian windows of widths @xmath1031.2mpc and @xmath1035mpc in comoving units for @xmath87 and @xmath90 ) with a log - normal distribution . for large smoothing scale",
    "the density field is indeed adequately described by a log - normal distribution . however , for decreasing smoothing scale , the true pdf becomes more and more skewed .",
    "the skewness of @xmath104 which we define as @xmath105 is one way of quantifying the deviation from a log - normal distribution and is also indicated on the plot .",
    ".moments of the density field .",
    "the symbols @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote average and absolute values respectively .",

    "the moments are computed assuming the true value of @xmath79 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    the assumed value of  will obviously also affect the determination of the moments described in the last section .",
    "figure 6 shows the dependence of the estimated moments on the assumed value of . for a reasonable range of  the biases range from 20 to 50 percent .",
    "if  is determined by fitting a log - normal cpdf and the moments are then estimated by fitting an edgeworth expansion to the cpdf with this value of  the biases in the moments are generally smaller than 25 percent .",
    "we have also run our inversion procedure with equation of states different from the one used to generate the mock spectra and changed the mean flux in order to test how sensitive the biases are to these parameters .",
    "the corresponding estimates of   and the moments are listed in table 2 .",
    "at least for the parameter space explored the biases seem to be robust .",
    "we have used numerical simulations to demonstrate that the l.o.s .",

    "we have thereby estimated the l.o.s .",

    "the inversion works well for the most underdense regions up to the density where the absorption features saturate . for ly@xmath1",
    "this occurs at an overdensity of a few but this limit can be pushed to higher densities by incorporating higher order lines of the lyman series .",
    ", however , an inversion will become increasingly more difficult at higher densities due to shell crossing and shock heating of the gas .",
    "we have then used the fact that the density probability distribution seems to have a universal shape to get reliable estimates of higher order moments of the pdf despite the missing high - density tail .",
    "we found that the edgeworth expansion is an excellent approximation to the pdf of the logarithm of the density , consistent with the results of colombi ( 1994 ) . by fitting the first two terms of such an edgeworth expansion we estimated a number of moments of the pdf with an accuracy of about 25 percent .",
    "estimates of similar accuracy were obtained for the parameter combination ( @xmath0by fitting to a log - normal distribution .",
    "we expect that , eventually , these biases can be corrected to 10 percent accuracy .    in principle it should also be possible to estimate the correlation function and the power spectrum directly from the recovered density field",

    "we have not yet investigated in detail how big the resulting errors are .",
    "it might well be that a comparison of observed flux power spectra with those of mock spectra as suggested by croft et al .",
    "is the most favourable way to deal with these problems .",
    "observational information on the pdf of the matter density comes so far mainly from the analysis of galaxy surveys and is restricted to small redshifts .",
    "these constraints could be checked and extended to a much wider redshift range by applying our inversion technique to a moderate number of qso absorption spectra of the kind which are now routinely taken with 10 m class telescopes .",
    "this should also check and tighten existing constraints on the evolution of the uv background . by combining our inversion technique with a redshift survey along qso",
    "sightlines the clustering of galaxies and matter can be related without referring to a particular cosmological model .",
    "such a determination of the bias between galaxy and matter clustering is especially worthwhile .",
    "most currently favoured models agree with the recently determined clustering strength of high - redshift galaxies but differ strongly in their predictions for the yet unknown bias relation ( adelberger et al .",
    "three - dimensional information on the density and peculiar velocity field can be gained by applying the method to two or more spatially close line - of - sights .",
    "an intermediate - resolution spectral survey of quasars down to about 22nd magnitude in a field of a couple of square degree size has e.g. been suggested as a possible project for the vlt ( petitjean 1996 ) .",
    "such a survey will result in about 100 l.o.s . in a region about 30mpc across . with the method proposed in the appendix such a region",
    "could become a unique laboratory for the study of how galaxy formation is related to the distribution and dynamics of the underlying matter field .",

    "we will briefly describe how estimates of the peculiar velocity can be obtained without assuming that the field @xmath114 is gaussian .",
    "let @xmath117 be the component of @xmath111 along the l.o.s .",

    "according to ( [ bi1 ] ) , the power spectrum of the unconditional @xmath120 is @xmath143 .",
    "this clearly differs from the power spectrum of @xmath144 given in ( [ varwth ] ) .",
    "following sigad et .",

    "we discuss the case of a single l.o.s .",
    "the generalisation to multiple parallel lines of sight is obvious .",
    "we arbitrarily choose the l.o.s . to be along the @xmath14 axis .",

    "the treatment so far relied on the hr method which assumes gaussian fields .",
    "this treatment will not be satisfactory for a 3d reconstruction in the non - linear regime .",
    "the unconstrained density field as given by ( [ cr ] ) is e.g. not guaranteed to have positive values everywhere .",
    "the scheme can be extended to the non - linear regime by two modifications : ( i ) use @xmath184 instead of @xmath116 , ( ii ) extract an unconstrained random field @xmath185 or its fourier transform @xmath186 from a fully non - linear n - body simulation .",
    "the simulations can be used to compute the 1d and 3d power spectra of @xmath184 which are required to generate the constrained realisation .",
    "but note that these power spectra can in principle be estimated from the density field along the l.o.s .    a 3d constrained realisation obtained with this scheme adapted to the non - linear regime can then be used to estimate the peculiar velocity without assuming @xmath114 to be gaussian .",
    "@xmath114 can be computed at any point in space from the 3d constrained realization of the density field using the velocity - density relation ( [ nus ] ) and assuming a potential flow .",
    "the peculiar velocity is then obtained by solving a poisson - like equation to recover @xmath114 .",
    "the implementation of this alternative scheme for recovering the peculiar velocity field and a comparisons to the scheme described in the last section is left to future work ."
