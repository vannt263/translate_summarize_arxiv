    "the layered perovskite nav@xmath0o@xmath1  shows an interesting interplay between charge ordering ( co ) of 3d- electrons on the rungs of v - v ladders and a spin- peierls transition associated with spin gap formation first observed in @xcite below t@xmath3= 34 k. this transition is associated with a distortion of the high temperature orthorhombic structure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1  .",
    "the latter can be viewed as trellis lattice with ab- planes stacked along c. they consist of ladders with v - o - v rungs ( inset of fig .",
    "[ energy ] ) shifted alternatingly along b by half a lattice constant .",
    "the precise low temperature structure is still controversial@xcite with the proposed models differing in the number of inequivalent v and na sites and an associated charge ordering on each or only on every second ladder .",
    "the slow progress and ambiguity of experimental results has hindered theoretical understanding considerably .",
    "however it has become clear now that there is a close connection between charge ordering on the v - v rungs and exchange dimerisation on the ladders@xcite which leads to the spin gap formation directly seen in inelastic neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "it was realized early on@xcite that the co on the v- rungs may be described within an ising model in a transverse field ( itp ) where the isospin ( s=@xmath4 ) represents the charge degree of freedom on the v - v rung with inter- site coulomb forces correspond to ising interactions and the intra - rung hopping to a transverse field .",
    "this is due to the charge transfer ( ct ) gap of @xmath5 0.4 - 0.5 ev @xcite which leads to an insulating state of nav@xmath0o@xmath1   despite having only one 3d- electron per rung ( quarter - filled ladders ) .",
    "therefore only singly occupied rungs have to be considered which may be represented by an isospin and the real spin . a detailed model of the combined ising- spin peierls system and",
    "its phase transitions has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the charge ordering in a trellis lattice compound is severely hindered by frustration of inter - site coulomb forces which is directly obvious in the ising model representation .",
    "in fact on a rigid lattice co would be prohibited since the lattice of v - v rungs corresponds to a trigonal covering lattice of ising spins .",
    "the simultaneous structural distortion at t@xmath3 reduces the frustration by leading to inequivalent adjacent ladders .",
    "the driving mechanism for the transition are inter- site coulomb interactions and exchange - striction .",
    "the gain in coulomb energy ( v@xmath6 ) by complete co in a rung is in competition with the loss of intra - rung kinetic energy ( t@xmath7 ) , the control parameter for co is therefore @xmath8 = @xmath9 ( for convenience the inverse definition of @xcite is used here ) .",
    "the very low co transition temperature suggest that in nav@xmath0o@xmath1  one is close to the quantum critical point @xmath10=1 of the corresponding itp model@xcite .",
    "the charge ordering is then essentially of 1d ising type , this means one has long range correlations along the ladder and no correlations between them , this was indeed obtained in exact diagonalisation studies of the itp@xcite .",
    "the ordering may then be viewed as arising from ising like correlations along the chain which lead to a true 2d broken symmetry state at finite t due to a staggered longitudinal ising field set up by the distortion of the neighboring ladders @xcite .    in this context",
    "it is suggestive that even small perturbations of the 1d ising correlations might reduce or destroy the co state in nav@xmath0o@xmath1  .",
    "this can be achieved by reducing the filling factor n of the 1d ladders below @xmath11 by doping with holes .",
    "this introduces `` empty '' rungs into the ladder which cut the ising bonds .",
    "the ensuing destruction of long range 1d correlations should then strongly reduce t@xmath3 as function of the hole concentration @xmath2 ( n=@xmath11-@xmath2 ) .",
    "this has indeed been found by introducing holes in the ladders through na- deficiency doping @xcite where a few per cent holes are sufficient to destroy the co state and the associated spin peierls transition .",
    "rapid suppression of charge order has also been found in various other doping series , i.e. replacing na by li and k ( isoelectronic ) or ca ( electron - doping ) .",
    "@xcite this may be observed directly by specific heat measurements@xcite which show a progressive suppression of @xmath12c(t@xmath3 ) with increasing doping . it is also seen in the susceptibility@xcite which shows a closing of the co induced spin gap .",
    "most importantly in this doping range nav@xmath0o@xmath1  remains an insulator which is not easy to understand within a hubbard like model for the quarter filled ladder@xcite , possibly 1d loalization effects play a role , indeed the conductivity was found to exhibit variable range hopping behaviour@xcite for hole doping .",
    "the notion that charge ordering t@xmath3 is reduced because doping creates empty rungs which cut the ising bonds along the ladder is however completely static and invokes a disordered state .",
    "it lacks the important ingredient of kinetic energy gain due to the hopping of holes between adjacent rungs leading to a homogeneous state .",
    "this problem has sofar not been considered theoretically .    in this work we will give a more solid theoretical basis for the influence of hole doping on co in nav@xmath0o@xmath1  .",
    "this will again be done in the context of an effective isospin approach . in sect .",
    "[ elstruc ] we give the basics of the electronic structure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and discuss the isospin model for the undoped case in sect .",
    "[ undoped ] . subsequently in sect .",
    "[ doped ] we show that even in the doped case the low energy hamiltonian may be projected to an effective ising type form , albeit with an ising spin t=1 to accomodate the holes on empty rungs . in sect .",
    "[ co ] we discuss how order parameter , kinetic energy and chemical potential ( doping level ) are represented in the isospin formalism and their respective coupled mean field equations in the ground state in sect .",
    "they are solved in sect .",
    "[ numerical ] numerically and we discuss the variation of the co parameter with the control parameter @xmath8 and the hole doping @xmath2 which leads to the zero temperature co phase diagram . finally sect .",
    "[ summary ] gives summary and outlook .",
    "the electronic structure of the charge transfer insulator nav@xmath0o@xmath1  has been investigated@xcite within the lda and lda+u approach respectively .",
    "a mapping of the resulting band structure to an extended tight binding ( tb ) model involving both v 3d and o 2p orbitals has also been performed@xcite and an excellent fitting of the lda+u bandstructure was obtained . for our present purpose it is sufficient to use a reduced tb model involving only v 3d@xmath13 orbitals .",
    "the hopping elements involved in this model are defined in fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "there are four v atoms in the unit cell resulting in two 3d@xmath13 occupied valence and two empty 3d@xmath13 conduction bands separated by a charge transfer gap of about 0.3 mev which is largely determined by the effective intra- rung hopping t@xmath7 . in the effective tb model this gap may be interpreted as bonding- antibonding gap of v 3d@xmath13 orbitals of a rung .",
    "furthermore the valence and conduction band are each almost twofold degenerate due to the weak hopping between ladders .",
    "the 3d@xmath13 bonding bands have a considerable dispersion of order t@xmath6+t@xmath14 along the b- direction while the dispersion t@xmath6-t@xmath14 of 3d@xmath13 antibonding bands is almost zero due to accidental near equality t@xmath15 .",
    "the basic many body hamiltonian describing nav@xmath0o@xmath1  is of the single band ( 3d@xmath13 ) extended hubbard type @xcite . as shown in @xcite , due to the presence of a ct gap the charge degrees of freedom",
    "may be represented by an effective itp hamiltonian ( t=@xmath4 ) which is obtained by projecting the original hamiltonian to the subspace of singly occupied rungs@xcite .",
    "the states @xmath16 , @xmath17 of the t=@xmath4 isospin describes occupied d@xmath13- orbitals on the left and right v atom of each rung respectively . a simplified version of the resulting itp hamiltonian for a single ladder is given by@xcite    @xmath18 -2t_a\\sum_it_{ix}{\\nonumber}\\\\ & & -h_s^0\\sum_i(-1)^it_{zi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here t@xmath7 is the hopping across the rung and v@xmath6 the coulomb interaction along the leg of a ladder .",
    "the last term is due to a staggered longitudinal isospin field h@xmath19 = ( -1)@xmath20h@xmath21 which simulates the influence of the neighboring ladders@xcite . for @xmath8 = 2t@xmath7/v@xmath22=1",
    "one obtains an af ordering of isospins which corresponds to the zig - zag ordering of 3d- electrons on the ladder as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the interaction parameters in eq .",
    "[ hamitp ] are renormalized by virtual processes via doubly occupied rungs or sites which depends on the spin state .",
    "this leads to a coupling of isospin ( charge ) and spin degrees of freedom whose contribution is neglected here .",
    "the zig - zag co in a ladder is characterized by the order parameter @xmath23 at zero temperature with ( @xmath241 )    @xmath25^\\beta \\label{op}\\ ] ]    the exact solution of the 1d itf model has the exponent @xmath26 and @xmath10=1 .",
    "it is understood that an infinitesimal staggered field h@xmath19 has to be applied to lift the twofold degeneracy of the ordered ground state .",
    "a truncated mean field ( mf ) approximation suppressing double counting of bonds in the molecular field leads to a critical value @xmath10=1 .",
    "this is the same quantum critical point that separates the co ( @xmath271 ) phase from the disordered phase ( @xmath281 ) as for the exact solution@xcite .",
    "naturally the mf critical op exponent @xmath29 is different .",
    "the charge ordering described by the itp model and its implications for the ( spin- ) superexchange have been described in detail in @xcite . in the present work",
    "we want to investigate whether the convenient and physically appealing isospin approach for co in nav@xmath0o@xmath1  can also be applied to the hole doped compound to study the suppression of co. for this purpose the hole states , that is empty v - v rungs with zero 3d- occupation , also have to be represented by an isospin degree of freedom . as in the stoichiometric case@xcite doubly occupied rung states either have a large charge transfer energy ( t@xmath7 ) or a large on - site coulomb repulsion and therefore contribute only as intermediate states by renormalizing the interaction parameters of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "thus the model has to incorporate three basis states , two singly occupied and one empty rung state which suggests to use a t=1 isospin instead of t=@xmath4 for the stoichiometric ( @xmath2=0 ) case .",
    "the mapping of electronic states to isospin states for rung i is then defined as    @xmath30 denoting the empty rung state .",
    "we first express the inter- rung coulomb energy already present in eq .",
    "( [ hamitp ] ) in the above extended isospin basis .",
    "the projectors to this basis may be written in terms of the t=1 isospin operators * t*= ( t@xmath31,t@xmath32,t@xmath33 ) as    @xmath34    where p@xmath35+p@xmath36=1 and p@xmath36=p@xmath37+p@xmath38 holds .",
    "the other projector properties p@xmath35p@xmath36= p@xmath36p@xmath35=0 and p@xmath39= p@xmath40 ( @xmath8=0,l , r ) are easily verified . using these projection operators the intra- ladder coulomb interactions v@xmath6 between adjacent rungs i , j",
    "may be represented by the hamiltonian    @xmath41    compared to the t=@xmath4 case of eq .",
    "( [ hamitp ] ) h@xmath42 also contains now biquadratic terms in the isospin .",
    "similarly we construct the intra- rung kinetic energy responsible for the charge transfer gap .",
    "since the r , l- occupation of each rung is now described by @xmath43 respectively the intra - rung hopping term must change the isospin by @xmath442 units .",
    "the corresponding rung hamiltonian then reads    @xmath45    which should be compared to the second term in eq .",
    "( [ hamitp ] ) for t=@xmath4 .",
    "finally there has to be an additional term describing the hole kinetic energy , i.e. when the empty rung ( fig.[energy ] ) is shifted along the ladder direction .",
    "such processes are described by inter- rung terms like    @xmath46{\\nonumber}\\\\ & + & 2t_-[o_{zx}(i)o^\\dagger_{zx}(j)+o^\\dagger_{zx}(i)o_{zx}(j)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with i , j denoting rungs along the ladder . here",
    "t@xmath47=@xmath4(t@xmath48t@xmath14 ) and o@xmath49=it@xmath33t@xmath32 and o@xmath50=t@xmath33t@xmath31 may be interpreted as a quadrupolar operator in the t=1 isospin space . in the following we consider only the special case t@xmath51 t@xmath14 which is appropriate for nav@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",

    "furthermore we have defined v@xmath57 .",
    "if we neglect the ladder diagonal coulomb interaction ( v@xmath580 ) then v@xmath47=@xmath4v@xmath6 leading to a single control parameter @xmath8= 2t@xmath7/v@xmath6 .",
    "although we expect the isospin model a convenient framework to discuss the energetics of charge ordering as function of doping it can however not give answer to the question why the doped system stays an insulator , for this problem one also has to include the doubly occupied rung states .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that even under a finite charge transfer between ladders , i.e. deviations from quarter - filling , an insulating state can be expected for the relevant hopping and interaction parameters realised in nav@xmath0o@xmath1  .",
    "it is obvious that the model defined by eq .",
    "[ ham1 ] is much more complex due to the additional hole state ( t@xmath33=0 ) and has no exact 1d solution like the t=@xmath4 itf model .",
    "as mentioned previously the truncated mf approximation for the charge order parameter of the itf model has the same quantum critical point @xmath10=1 as the exact solution .",
    "it is therefore plausible that a mf treatment of eq .",
    "[ ham1 ] in the doped case still gives a qualitatively correct picture for the conditions of charge ordering .",
    "as in the itf case the order parameter for v@xmath59v@xmath14 should be staggered , i.e zig - zag co should be realized , then for the two sublattices we have    @xmath60    now x not only depends on the control parameter @xmath8=2t@xmath7/v@xmath6 but also on the number of holes or unoccupied rungs .",
    "the representation of the hole number operator in fermionic and isospin language is given by    @xmath61    so that the hole concentration is obtained as    @xmath62    since it is externally fixed by the level of doping the local orbital energy has to be adjusted selfconsistently for each parameter set such that @xmath2 is obtained .",
    "this can be done by adding a chemical potential , i.e. replacing @xmath63 . for each microscopic parameter set and order parameter x , the chemical potential @xmath64 has to be adjusted appropriately to obtain the physical hole number .",
    "the usefulness of a simple mf solution relies on the ising type nature of the present model . in this approximation the doping term @xmath65 in eq .",
