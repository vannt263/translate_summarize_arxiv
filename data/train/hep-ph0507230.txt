    "the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak ( ew ) interactions has met with extraordinary success ; it has been tested already at the level of quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "these corrections give some hints about the nature of the higgs sector , pointing towards the existence of a relatively light higgs boson , with a mass of the order of the ew scale , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , it is widely believed that the sm can not be the final theory of particle physics , in particular because the higgs sector suffers from naturalness problems , and we really do not have a clear understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "these problems in the higgs sector can be stated as our present inability to find a satisfactory answer to some questions regarding its structure . in terms of the higgs potential ,",
    "@xmath18 these questions can be stated as follows :    1 .   what fixes the size ( and sign ) of the _ dimensionful parameter _",
    "@xmath19 ? .",
    "this parameter determines the scale of ewsb in the sm ; in principle it could be as high as the planck mass , however it needs to be fixed to much lower values .",
    "2 .   what is the nature of the quartic higgs coupling @xmath0 ? .",
    "this parameter is not associated with a known symmetry , and we expect all interactions in nature to be associated somehow with gauge forces , as these are the ones we understand better @xcite .",
    "an improvement on our understanding of ewsb is provided by the supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm @xcite , where loop corrections to the tree - level parameter @xmath19 are under control , thus making the higgs sector more natural .",
    "the quartic higgs couplings is nicely related with gauge couplings through relations of the form : @xmath20 , thus solving this aspect of the problem too . in the susy alternative",
    "it is even possible to ( indirectly ) explain the sign of @xmath19 as a result loop effects and the breaking of the symmetry between bosons and fermions .",
    "even if the higgs mass parameter is taken to be positive at a high energy scale , renormalization effects drive its value negative at the ew scale , thus generating ( explaining ) ewsb .    further progress to understand the sm structure is achieved in grand unified theories ( gut ) , where the strong and electroweak gauge interactions are unified at a very high - energy scale ( @xmath21 ) @xcite . however , certain consequences of the gut idea seem to indicate that this unification , by itself , may be too violent ( within the minimal su(5 ) gut model one actually gets inexact unification , too large proton decay , doublet - triplet problem , bad fermion mass relations , etc . ) , and some additional theoretical tool is needed to overcome these difficulties .",
    "again , susy offers an amelioration of these problems .",
    "when susy is combined with the gut program , one gets a more precise gauge coupling unification and some aspects of proton decay and fermion masses are under better control @xcite .",
    "however , in order to verify the realization of susy - gut in nature , it will take the observation of plenty of new phenomena such as superpartners , proton decay or rare decay modes . as nice as these ideas",
    "may appear , it seems worthwhile to consider other approaches for physics beyond the sm .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that additional progress towards understanding the sm origin , can be achieved by postulating the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "these theories have received much attention , mainly because of the possibility they offer to address the problems of the sm from a new geometrical perspective . these range from a new approach to the hierarchy problem @xcite up to a possible explanation of flavor hierarchies in terms of field localization along the extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "model with extra dimensions have been applied to neutrino physics @xcite , higgs phenomenology @xcite , among many others . in the particular gut context",
    ", it has been shown that it is possible to find viable solutions to the doublet - triplet problem @xcite .",
    "more recently , new methods in strong interactions have also been used as an attempt to revive the old models ( tc , etc , topcolor , etc ) @xcite .",
    "other ideas have motivated new types of models as well ( little higgs @xcite , ads / cft composite higgs models @xcite , etc ) .    in this paper we are interested in exploring alternative unification scenarios , of weakly - interacting type , which could offer direct understanding of the higgs sector too .",
    "we shall explore the consequences of a scenario where the electroweak @xmath22 gauge interactions are unified with the higgs self - interaction at an intermediate scale @xmath1 .",
    "namely , we take seriously the indication of the running of the sm gauge couplings , which taken at face value ( see figure 1 ) show that the @xmath23 and @xmath24 couplings approach first each other , before crossing with the strong coupling constant .",
    "thus , we propose two variants for the unification condition which permit to predict the sm higgs boson mass , with resulting values of the order @xmath25 gev .",
    "the dependence of our results on the choice for the normalization for the hypercharge is also discussed , as well as possible test of this ew - higgs unification idea at future colliders , such as ilc .",
    "we consider then ( section iii ) the implementation of this idea in the two - higgs doublet model , which allows to predict the higgs spectrum , namely the masses for the neutral cp - even states ( @xmath26 ) , the neutral cp - odd state ( @xmath27 ) and the charged higgs ( @xmath28 ) . at this point",
    "it is relevant to compare our approach with the so called gauge - higgs unification program as they share some similarities .",
    "we think that our approach is more model independent , as we first explore the consequences of a parametric unification , without really choosing a definite model at higher energies .",
    "in fact , at higher energies both the susy models as well as the framework of extra dimensions could work as ultraviolet completion of our approach .",
    "the susy models could work because they allow to relate the scalar quartic couplings to the gauge couplings , thanks to the d - terms @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , within the extra - dimensions it is also possible to obtain similar relations , when the higgs fields are identified as the extra - dimensional components of gauge fields @xcite .",
    "actually , we feel that the work of ref.@xcite has a similar spirit to ours , in their case they look for gauge unification of the higgs self - couplings that appear in the superpotential of nmssm , and then they justify their work with a concrete model in 7d .",
    "thus , in our case we also discuss the unification of the ew - higgs couplings with the strong constant , which can be realized within the context of extra - dimensional gauge - higgs unified theories .",
    "in particular we discuss a 6d @xmath29 model , which is broken on an orbifold @xmath30 and the sm higgs doublet is identified with the extra - dimensional components of the gauge fields .     in the context of the sm , taking @xmath31 gev . ]     in the context of the sm with @xmath9 , in the frame of scenario i , taking @xmath32 gev . ]     in the context of the sm with @xmath9 , in the frame of scenario ii , taking @xmath32 gev . ]     in the context of the sm with @xmath33 , in the frame of scenario i , taking @xmath32 gev . ]",
    "in the present ew - higgs unified scenario , we shall assume that there exists a scale where the gauge couplings constants @xmath2 , associated with the gauge symmetry @xmath34 , are unified , and that at this scale they also get unified with the higgs self coupling @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath3 at @xmath1 .",
    "the precise relation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( the sm hypercharge coupling ) involves a normalization factor @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath37 , which depends on the unification model .",
    "the standard normalization gives @xmath9 , which is associated with minimal models such as @xmath38 .",
    "however , in the context of string theory it is possible to have such standard normalization without even having a unification group . for other unification groups that involve additional @xmath23 factors",
    ", one would have exotic normalizations too , and similarly for the case of gut models in extra - dimensions . in",
    "what follows we shall present results for the cases : @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which indeed arise in string - inspired models @xcite . note that these values fall in the range @xmath41 and",
    "so they can illustrate what happens when one chooses a value below or above the standard normalization .",
    "the form of the unification condition will depend on the particular realization of this scenario , which could be as generic as possible .",
    "however , in order to be able to make predictions for the higgs boson mass , we shall consider two specific realizations .",
    "scenario i will be based on the linear relation : @xmath42 , where the factor @xmath43 is included in order to retain some generality , for instance to take into account possible unknown group theoretical or normalization factors .",
    "motivated by specific models , such as susy itself , as well as an argument based on the power counting of the beta coefficients in the rge for scalar couplings , namely the fact that @xmath44 goes as @xmath45 , we shall also define scenario ii , through the quadratic unification condition : @xmath46 .",
    "the sm renormalization group equations at the one loop level involving the gauge coupling constants @xmath47 , the higgs self - coupling @xmath0 , the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath48 , and the parameter @xmath5 , can be written as follows @xcite :    @xmath49 \\ , \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we also take the values for the coupling constants as reported in the review of particle properties @xcite , while for the top quark mass we take the value recently reported in  @xcite .    in order to get a flavor of the coupling constants behavior and evolution ,",
    "we find it convenient to discuss first an analytical solution based on the one - loop beta - functions for the gauge couplings ( eqs .",

    "we will only keep the term proportional to @xmath0 itself , and work with the canonical normalization @xmath9 . in this case , the solution for the gauge coupling constants takes the form : @xmath54 then , from the unification condition @xmath55 , we get the value : @xmath56 gev . solving the equation for @xmath0 ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath57 then , using the relation @xmath58 from scenario i , with @xmath59 , we get the value of @xmath0 at low energies , i.e. for @xmath60 , it is @xmath61 , which implies a higgs boson mass of @xmath62 gev .",
    "this value is indeed of the order of the ew scale and the result looks quite encouraging .",
    "now , let us discuss first the results of the full numerical analysis for @xmath9 , for which we find that @xmath63 gev . figures 2 and 3 show the prediction for the higgs boson mass in scenarios i and ii , respectively .",
    "the higgs boson mass is shown as function of the parameter @xmath43 over a range @xmath64 , which covers three orders of magnitude and hopefully illustrates the generality of our results .",
    "we want to point out here that the expected natural value for @xmath43 is 1 .",
    "for such a range of @xmath43 , the higgs boson mass takes the values : @xmath65 gev for scenario i , while for @xmath59 we obtain a prediction for the higgs boson mass : @xmath66 gev , for a top quark mass of @xmath67 gev @xcite , respectively . on the other hand , for scenario",
    "ii , we find that the higgs boson mass can take the values : @xmath68 gev , while for @xmath59 we obtain : @xmath69 gev",
    ".    then , when we compare our results with the higgs boson mass obtained from ew precision measurements , which imply @xmath70 gev , we notice that in order to get compatibility with such value , our model seems to prefer high values of @xmath43 . for instance , by taking the lowest value that we consider here for the top mass , @xmath71 gev , and fixing @xmath72 , we obtain the minimum value for the higgs boson mass equal to @xmath73 gev in scenario i , while scenario ii implies a slightly minimal lower value , namely @xmath74 gev .    in turn ,",
    "figures 4 and 5 , show the results for the higgs boson mass using the value @xmath33 , for which we find that @xmath75 gev , somehow higher than the previous case , but for which one still gets a mass gap between @xmath1 and a possible @xmath21 .",
    "one finds somehow higher values for the higgs boson mass , for instance for @xmath59 , one gets @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) gev for scenarios i ( ii ) .    on the other hand , figures 6 and 7 , show the results for the higgs boson mass using the value @xmath11 , for which we find that @xmath78 gev , which is lower than the one of the previous cases , and has an even larger mass gap between @xmath1 and a possible @xmath21 .",
    "one finds somehow higher values for the higgs boson mass , for instance for @xmath59 , one gets @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) gev for scenarios i ( ii ) .    at this point , rather than continuing discussions on the precise higgs boson mass , we would like to emphasize that our approach based on the ew - higgs unification idea is very successful in giving a higgs boson mass that has indeed the correct order of magnitude , and that once measured at the lhc we will be able to fix the parameter @xmath43 and find connections with other approaches for physics beyond the sm , such as the one to be discussed next .",
    "in fact , for the higgs boson mass range that is predicted in our approach , it turns out that the higgs will decay predominantly into the mode @xmath81 , from which there are good chances to meassure the higgs boson mass with a precision of the order @xmath82 @xcite , therefore it will make possible to bound @xmath43 to within the few percent level . further tests of our ew - higgs unification hypothesis would involve testing more implications of the quartic higgs coupling . for instance one could use the production of higgs pairs ( @xmath83 ) at a future linear collider , such as the ilc .",
    "this is just another example of the complementarity of future studies at lhc and ilc .    to end this section",
    ", we show the evolution of the running couplings @xmath84 as functions of the scale @xmath51 in the context of the sm for @xmath9 , @xmath33 , and @xmath11 in figures 8 , 9 , 10 , respectively .",

    "here is where extra - dimensions will play a prominent role .",
    "we assume that above @xmath1 the window into a pair of extra - dimensions opens up .",

    "furthermore , @xmath158 ( odd - odd ) has zero modes , and its v.e.v . can break the symmetry further , namely from @xmath159 ( for a more complete discussion of this model , but with a compactification scale of @xmath160 , see our coming article @xcite ) .",
    "turning now to the gauge coupling unification , we notice that above @xmath1 the evolution of both the @xmath161 and @xmath162 gauge couplings will need to incorporate the effects of the kk modes . to describe such effects we shall use the formulas presented in  @xcite , and we shall also incorporate the fermion content discussed in  @xcite",
    ", namely the lh leptons make a triplet under @xmath162 , for which one needs to add an exotic lepton , while the lh quarks and the rh up - type quarks will also behave as triplets under @xmath162 , in addition one needs to include their mirror partners , as it is required from considering chiral fermions in six dimensions .",
    "we shall also assume that either the inclusion of additional @xmath23 factor or brane - kinetic terms , make possible to use the canonical normalization @xmath9 .",
    "then , the gauge constants @xmath163 and @xmath164 , at scales @xmath165 , are related to their values at the scale @xmath1 , through the one - loop expressions : @xmath166    the terms proportional to @xmath167 represent the effects of the zero modes , while those proportional to @xmath168 correspond to the effects of the kk modes . for the strong group",
    "we obtain : @xmath169 , the factor -11 comes from pure qcd , while the factor + 4 arises from the 12 weyl quark fields .",
    "also @xmath170 , and here -11 represents the effects of the kk modes of the gluon , while + 1 comes from the pair of adjoint colored scalars that come with the massive kk gluons . for the ew - higgs sector",
    "we obtain : @xmath171 , @xmath172 ; now @xmath173 is smaller than @xmath174 because in addition to the quarks we also have to consider the leptons as triplets of @xmath175 , as well as their mirror partners , which amount to include a total of 24 weyl fermion fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the function @xmath176 represents the sum over the kk modes , and in the continuous limit it can be approximated as : @xmath177 .",
    "the solution to these equations are matched to the ones for @xmath178 at @xmath1 , and are shown in figure 19 .",
    "one can notice that unification of @xmath179 and @xmath139 appears to occur already at an scale @xmath180 , however this is just the scale where the couplings start to approach each other .",
    "in fact , the solution to the equation @xmath181 , gives a scale @xmath182 gev ( see figure 19 and table  [ tab : t2 ] ) , which we think represents better the scale at which the group @xmath183 unifies into some larger group , for instance @xmath184 , which may or not induce a large rate for proton decay .",
    "in any case , the gut scale obtained above is still above the one obtained from current limits on proton decay induced by dimension - six operators @xcite .",
    "we want to point out that according to eqs .",
    "( 30 ) and ( 31 ) the value of @xmath21 depends only on the value of @xmath1 , if we assume an uncertainty of 10% ( 50% ) on the value of @xmath1 i.e. @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) this leads to a similar uncertainty in @xmath21 , namely we obtain @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "we have checked numerically that the value of @xmath1 does not depend strongly on experimental errors of the low - energy values of the coupling constants and parametric errors from the sm input .",
    "we have already pointed out in section ii that in order to perform our numerical calculations we employ the full two - loop sm renormalization group equations involving the gauge coupling constants @xmath47 , the higgs self - coupling @xmath0 , the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath48 , and the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "however , we have checked that the one - loop sm renormalization group equations dominate by far the evolution of the @xmath47 @xmath189 and @xmath48 couplings .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the value of @xmath1 and hence the value of @xmath21 do not depend on missing higher - order corrections in the renormalization group equations .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we have already seen @xmath1 depends strongly on the normalization constant @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath190 gev ) we get @xmath191 gev , and for @xmath33 ( i.e. @xmath192 gev ) we get @xmath193 gev .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a framework where it is possible to unify the higgs self - coupling with the gauge interactions . working first within a phenomenological approach we use this idea to derive a prediction for the higgs mass , which is of the order @xmath25 gev .",
    "then , we showed how this simple idea can be realized within the context of extra - dimensional theories , where it is also possible to achieve extended unification at a correct gut scale .",
    "thus , we have succeeded in identifying the higgs self - interaction as another manifestation of gauge symmetry .",
    "the hypercharge normalization plays an important role to identify the ew - higgs unification scale . for the canonical value",
    "@xmath9 we get @xmath194 gev . for lower values , such as @xmath33",
    "the scale is @xmath192 gev , which is closer to the gut one ( @xmath195 gev ) but for higher values , such as @xmath11 , which gives @xmath190 gev , the ew - higgs unification becomes clearly distinctive .",
    "the present approach still lacks a solution to the hierarchy problem ; at the moment we have to affiliate to argument that fundamental physics could accept some fine tuning @xcite .",
    "another option would be to consider one of the simplest early attempts to solve the problem of quadratic divergences in the sm , namely through an accidental cancellation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , such kind of cancellation implies a relationship between the quartic higgs coupling and the yukawa and gauge constants , which has the form : @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately , this relation implies a higgs mass @xmath197 gev , and that seems already excluded .",
    "nevertheless , this relation could work if one takes into account the running of the coupling and yukawa constants , a point that we leave for future investigations .      for a review of radiative corrections",
