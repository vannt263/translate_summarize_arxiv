    "magnetic field observations toward star forming regions are becoming increasingly more important as the relevance of the magnetic field in the star formation process is being recognized in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the observational side ,",
    "recent instrumentation progress with improved sensitivities and polarization capabilities is advancing this field .",
    "common observing techniques leading to some magnetic field information include zeeman splitting , dust polarization , molecular line polarization and synchrotron emission .",
    "any of these techniques has shortcomings and advantages , usually revealing only partial information of a magnetic field structure with its morphology , direction and strength .",
    "zeeman splitting in spectral lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically leads to a line - of - sight field strength . in most cases , isolated positions or patches in a molecular cloud",
    "are mapped with this technique .",
    "capturing the field morphology over a more extended area has been challenging .",
    "recent observations of zeeman splitting in masers are now able to start to trace the field morphology with a largely increased number of detections @xcite .",
    "furthermore , results by @xcite and @xcite are consistently complementing dust polarization observations . in this latter technique ,",
    "dust grains are expected to be aligned with their shorter axis parallel to the magnetic field lines most likely due to radiative torques @xcite , therefore revealing a plane - of - sky projected field orientation and morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a growing number of observations by both single dish telescopes ( cso , e.g. , @xcite , the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , e.g. , @xcite ) and interferometers ( the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) array , e.g. , @xcite , the sma , e.g. , @xcite and the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) , @xcite ) , in the ( sub-)millimeter regime with resolutions from @xmath6 to sub - arcsecond , are detecting dust polarized emission showing systematic magnetic field structures .",
    "additionally , a comparison of dust polarization observations at different frequencies can possibly also shed light on the nature of different grain populations @xcite .",
    "complementary to dust polarization , linearly polarized spectral lines @xcite can probe the field morphology throughout the circumstellar envelope .",
    "recent detections in various molecular lines are giving hints of a complex field structure in the envelope @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , both polarized line and dust emission do not provide information on the magnetic field strength .",
    "additional modeling is needed .",
    "recent techniques revealing additional magnetic field properties include e.g. , polarization angle dispersion functions providing an estimate of the turbulent to mean magnetic field strength ratio @xcite , comparison between co - existing ion and molecular line spectra constraining the ambipolar diffusion scale @xcite and the polarization - intensity gradient method leading to a position - dependent estimate of the magnetic field strength @xcite",
    ". finally , observing polarized synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons has the potential to map morphology and field strength in outflows and jets @xcite .",
    "this technique can , thus , ideally complement other magnetic field observations that are limited to core regions .",
    "dust polarization observations are probably providing the largest data sets so far to study the role of the magnetic field in star formation regions .",
    "in particular , these observations typically show a fairly large coverage , with polarized emission found throughout a significant area overlapping with stokes @xmath7 emission . consequently ,",
    "dust polarization maps are ideal to investigate systematic magnetic field features .",
    "nevertheless , assessing the role of the magnetic field from such observations remains challenging .",
    "when interpreting the data , one is often left with either relying on theoretical concepts or comparing the data with numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we aim at filling this gap .",
    "we propose a phenomenological approach . based on",
    "systematically observed features we aim at providing guidelines for an interpretation of the role of the magnetic field .",
    "a particular emphasis is given to the relative importance of magnetic field versus gravity . to that purpose , the relation between the magnetic field and emission gradient orientation ( the angle @xmath0 )  originally pointed out in @xcite  is studied here on a broader sample with a further expanded complementary analysis .",
    "we note that during the revision of this work , first numerical simulations analyzing the relative orientations of magnetic fields with respect to density structures were presented in @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that both density and the level of magnetization leave their imprints on the distributions of relative orientations .",
    "this present work has benefited from a growing number of polarization observations over the past years . in particular ,",
    "the high - resolution ( sub-)arcsecond observations by the sma @xcite were pioneering insights , methods and interpretation of the magnetic field that we are now also able to apply to earlier lower - resolution observations by other instruments .",
    "the proposed interpretation here is , thus , generally applicable to dust polarization observations .",
    "this study is part of the program on the sma @xcite to investigate the structure of the magnetic field from large to small scales .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ interpretation ]",
    "we present observational results of the angle @xmath0 from 2 different instruments , from @xmath8 to sub - arcsecond resolutions .",
    "we , additionally , provide an interpretation of the angle @xmath0 by manipulating the mhd force equation .",
    "supplementary material putting this in a context with our previous work is given in appendix a. a brief summary and comparison of the relevant magnetic field quantities from our previous and current study follows in section [ summary_parameters ] .",
    "section [ section_tracer ] establishes the angle @xmath0 as an approximation and reliable tracer for the changing role of the magnetic field over an observed map .",
    "appendix b contains maps of a large sample in support of this finding . as a consequence , in section [ section_scenarios ]",
    "we propose a schematic scenario where the magnetic field significance evolves and is revealed through distinct changes and features in the angle @xmath0 . conclusion and summary are given in section [ section_conclusion ] .",
    "projected magnetic field orientations ( rotated by 90@xmath9 with respect to detected dust polarization orientations ) form an angle @xmath0 with their stokes @xmath7 dust intensity gradient orientations ( figure [ schematic_basics ] ) .",
    "observationally , this angle @xmath0 is straight forward to determine .",
    "based on our recent results that point toward a connection in these orientations @xcite , we further investigate this finding here on a larger and diverse data set .",
    "the data analyzed in section [ delta_observations ] and appendix b with their systematic patterns in the angle @xmath0 are suggestive for a direct physical meaning of this angle .",
    "a first intuitive interpretation of @xmath0 was attempted in the context of the polarization - intensity gradient method @xcite . in this new method",
    "it was assumed that the emission intensity gradient is a measure for the result of all the forces acting in a molecular cloud . in section [ delta_mhd ] we will proceed to explain the angle @xmath0 in the framework of ideal magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) . appendix a discusses in detail how this interpretation is linked to the approach in @xcite .",
    "we present results for the angle @xmath0 , derived from both single dish and interferometric observations . in a first section",
    "we investigate features in @xmath0 in 4 sources where the magnetic field is probed at different physical scales .",
    "as we will argue later in the sections [ section_tracer ] and [ section_scenarios ] , we consider these sources as representative for different evolutionary stages in the star formation process , where the role of the magnetic field can be assessed by analyzing the angle @xmath0 . in support of this argument , an additional set of 24 sources",
    "is analyzed in appendix b. in the second section here , we then focus on higher resolution observations which are probing systems with collapsing cores , where the angle @xmath0 yet shows additional characteristics .      both hertz on the cso and scupol on the jcmt have published catalogs of polarization observations toward 56 @xcite and 83 @xcite regions , respectively , containing mostly galactic sources and some galaxies . in the following",
    "we showcase an analysis of a few of these sources , based on published data , to illustrate characteristic absolute value @xmath2-patterns .",
    "an identical analysis is carried out for the additional 24 cso sources in appendix b.    on ( large ) scales , where a clear gravity center still remains to be formed , a @xmath2-map seems irregular with no clear signatures ( figure [ figure_delta_scales ] ) . in some areas ,",
    "similar @xmath2-values are grouped together , other areas show a continuous change in @xmath2 .",
    "typically , specific @xmath2-values can not yet be associated with specific locations in the dust stokes @xmath7 map .",
    "this is because structures like clouds , envelopes and cores have not yet been formed .",
    "the complex co@xmath4 together with m@xmath5 , observed with a physical resolution @xmath10 mpc and covering a large area of about 12  pc @xmath11 12  pc ( cso , @xcite ) , is such an example .",
    "one might speculate that such a system is still affected and shaped by its surroundings where larger scale dynamics can lead to irregular patterns ( figure [ figure_delta_scales ] ) .",
    "the correlation between magnetic field and intensity gradient position angles ( @xmath12s ) is not yet clearly established with more cloud - like groups ( correlation coefficient @xmath13 ) .",
    "the histogram of @xmath2 shows a rather uniform distribution with @xmath14 ( middle bottom panel in figure [ figure_delta_scales ] ) .    on a next ( smaller ) scale",
    "we have selected 2 sources that show elongated structures : mon r2 ( @xmath15 mpc ) and m@xmath3 ( @xmath10 mpc over an area of about 7.7  pc @xmath11 4  pc ; cso , @xcite ) .",
    "the top and middle rows in figure [ figure_delta_scales_cont ] reveal clear and distinct features . in the case of mon r2 ( top row )",
    ", the magnetic field appears roughly perpendicular to the major axis of the stokes @xmath7 contours . here",
    ", material is likely following the field lines ( driven by gravity ) leading to an elongated and possibly flattened structure with gravity also starting to pull in the field lines at the 2 ends of the major axis . as a result , the @xmath2-map shows mostly small values , except toward the 2 ends of the major axis . here , maximum deviations of the field from the intensity gradient occur because the field is not yet clearly dragged in .",
    "the correlation , @xmath16 , for such a source is tighter than for the above system co@xmath4 with m@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2-histogram shows a clear peak at small values with @xmath17 .",
    "m@xmath3 displays inverse features ( middle row ) : the magnetic field is roughly along the major axis of the source .",
    "consequently , in a @xmath2-map , the smallest values are found at the 2 ends of the major axis , with the largest deviations in between them along the axis .",
    "the correlation is systematically off ( @xmath18 ) , which then also leads to the largest average deviation , @xmath19 , of the 3 sources described here .",
    "table [ table_quantities ] summarizes these results .",
    "the collapsing core w51 e2 ( @xmath20 mpc , @xcite ) yet shows different signatures on these smallest scales ( bottom row in figure [ figure_delta_scales_cont ] ) .",
    "the source mostly appears symmetrical .",
    "@xmath2-values are generally small with @xmath21 .",
    "these 2 findings might indicate that the source is already in a later phase of its collapse where gravity has pulled in and aligned the field lines with the intensity gradient .",
    "there is a trend of increasing @xmath2-values beneath and above a plane in northeast - southwest direction .",
    "polarized emission is absent along this direction .",
    "this area likely coincides with an accretion plane @xcite .",
    "we additionally explore this particular configuration in the next section [ section_delta_high_resolution ] .",
    "larger @xmath2-values as found in mon r2 are missing here .",
    "this , however , might be due to the current limitations in resolution and/or sensitivity of the observation .",
    "there are hints of increased @xmath2-values around the emission peak .",
    "compared to mon r2 , the zones of larger @xmath2-values appear to have shrunken and moved closer to the center .",
    "w51 e2 shows the tightest correlation between field and intensity gradient orientations with @xmath22 ( table [ table_quantities ] ) .",
    "it is striking that the @xmath2-maps of the above sources mon r2 and m@xmath3 reveal clear opposite trends .",
    "inspecting the additional 24 sources from the cso catalog shows that these trends are also found in other sources ( appendix b ) .",
    "the non - uniform and incomplete polarization coverage in some sources obviously tends to erase clear features .",
    "projection effects are unlikely mimicking these trends",
    ". it seems more plausible that certain selection effects and initial conditions from larger scales lead to one or the other case , with projection effects possibly distorting some features .",
    "large - scale flows might initially compress the field lines , leading to structures like seen in m@xmath3 .",
    "subsequently , gravity might take over and start to pull in the field lines .",
    "this will then eventually lead to a more symmetrical structure like in w51 e2 .",
    "the field morphology in mon r2 matches with an hourglass - like scenario where initially straight field lines are later pulled in by gravity leading again to an e2-type configuration .",
    "mon r2 might be showing the beginning of such a phase .",
    "in summary , the sources presented here seem suggestive for an evolutionary sequence where the role of the magnetic field leaves some signatures in the @xmath2-maps . in section [ section_tracer ]",
    "we will add further evidence to this idea , which will allow us to conclude with a schematic scenario in section [ section_scenarios ] .",
    "we highlight an additional feature of @xmath0-maps , focusing on high - resolution ( up to @xmath23 ) cores observed with the sma .",
    "figure [ figure_delta_cores ] shows @xmath0 for w51 e2 @xcite , w51 north @xcite , g5.89 - 0.39 @xcite and orion bn / kl @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath0 is displayed in the range of @xmath24 to @xmath25 , with the sign depending on whether the magnetic field is rotated counter - clockwise or clockwise with respect to the intensity gradient . for an enhanced visual impression the data are over - gridded .",
    "the color coding makes clear that there are systematic changes in the sign of @xmath0 between confined areas .",
    "this is particularly obvious for w51 e2 and the main cores in w51 north and orion bn / kl . nevertheless , even in g5.89  where only isolated patches of polarized emission are detected , possibly due to expanding hii regions @xcite  large areas with identical signs are found .",
    "we further analyze these maps by investigating the azimuthal @xmath26 dependence in @xmath0 .",
    "the top panel in figure [ figure_delta_azimuth ] illustrates @xmath27 for w51 e2 and the main cores in w51 north and orion bn / kl .",
    "for all sources azimuth is measured counter - clockwise from west , with its center assumed to be at the emission peak of each source .",
    "there are seemingly ranges in azimuth where @xmath0 is preferentially negative or positive , and there are zones where @xmath0 changes sign . in the middle panel we have by eye",
    "re - defined the origin of the azimuth coordinate in order to align the features from the top panel .",
    "starting from positive values around @xmath28 to @xmath29 , all 3 sources then show smaller and smaller values , reaching similar negative values after crossing zero .",
    "after this first zero - crossing there is a clear gap with no data for orion bn / kl and w51 north .",
    "then , values jump to the positive followed by a second zero - crossing over a smaller azimuth range .",
    "a clear gap is found here for w51 e2 between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we remark that between @xmath32 and @xmath33 all sources flip sign in @xmath0 again for a second time .",
    "thus , aligning the features from the top panel in figure [ figure_delta_azimuth ] clearly reveals systematic changes in @xmath0 with 2 fairly smooth zero - crossings and 2 zones where @xmath0 flips sign . for comparison ,",
    "the bottom panel in figure [ figure_delta_azimuth ] shows @xmath0 as a function of azimuth for g5.89 , where no clear features can be identified .",
    "figure [ figure_schematic_delta_azimuth ] proposes an explanation for the above findings in the context of a collapsing system with accretion and outflow zones .",
    "initially straight field lines are dragged in and bent by gravity . with respect to the intensity",
    "gradient orientations , distinct zones with negative or positive @xmath0-values emerge .",
    "the largest field curvature is expected in the accretion zones with @xmath0 flipping its sign between maximum negative and maximum positive values around the accretion plane . with material mostly following the field lines and the lines being less bent toward the poles",
    ", @xmath2 is decreasing toward the outflow regions .",
    "this then leads to a continuous change in @xmath0 across zero .",
    "we remark that outflows are likely to perturb the field morphologies around the poles .",
    "nevertheless , due to their small mass and possibly smaller dust - to - gas ratio , the currently available observations with their sensitivities and resolutions are predominantly tracing the core s field morphology .",
    "we , thus , neglect a possible influence of the outflow in the proposed scenario here .",
    "remarkably , despite being illustrated for a face - on pinched field structure in figure [ figure_schematic_delta_azimuth ] , all 3 sources in the middle panel in figure [ figure_delta_azimuth ] clearly reveal features matching the schematic .",
    "nevertheless , we have to note that changes from positive to negative zones do not exactly occur within a @xmath34 range in azimuth .",
    "equally , maximum and minimum values in @xmath0 vary with source .",
    "one might speculate that irregularities and differences are due to asymmetries and inclination / projection effects that stretch or compress certain features . in spite of these shortcomings",
    ", we can still conclude that the magnetic field azimuthal patterns in @xmath0 provide some clues on the state of a system by identifying characteristic accretion and outflow areas .",
    "furthermore , these features appear to be robust even in the presence of unknown inclination angles .",
    "finally , the proposed explanation in figure [ figure_schematic_delta_azimuth ] naturally leads to a bimodal distribution in @xmath0 .",
    "this has indeed been observed for w51 e2 in figure 2 in @xcite .",
    "distributions for all high - resolution cores discussed here are displayed in figure [ figure_histogram ] .",
    "we adopt an ideal mhd force equation as a starting point for the following derivation . as in @xcite",
    ", we impose the slight restriction that the orthogonal field component is a slowly varying function , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "this will hold for any smooth large - scale field functions in w51 e2 was independently estimated based on a structure function @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in observed polarization position angles due to turbulence are found to be typically 5 to 10@xmath9 , which translates into @xmath36 mg for w51 e2 .",
    "this is small compared to the total field strength estimates in most positions except for the weakest ones .",
    "thus , current observational results justify the above assumption . ] . in return",
    ", this then allows us to simplify and combine the magnetic field hydrostatic pressure and the field tension terms . with this , the force equation becomes @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the dust density and velocity , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "@xmath41 is the hydrostatic dust pressure .",
    "@xmath42 is the gravitational potential resulting from the total mass contained inside the star forming region .",
    "@xmath43 denotes the gradient .",
    "the field tension force ( last term on the right hand side ) with the field curvature @xmath44 is directed normal to the field line along the unity vector @xmath45 ( figure [ schematic_basics ] ) .",
    "as usual , the inertial term on the left hand side in equation ( [ mhd_momentum ] ) describes the resulting action based on the force terms on the right hand side .    in an observed map ,",
    "the detected intensity emission is typically a function of temperature and density .",
    "we now assume that the direction of the local temperature gradient is identical or at least not too different from the local density gradient direction with the intensity emission gradient only needs the _ local directions _ of temperature and density gradients to be aligned .",
    "thus , regions of different temperatures do not pose a problem in our approach , as long as temperature changes are accompanied by density changes toward roughly the same direction . ] . in this case , the observed intensity gradient direction on a map can be identified with the direction of the density gradient along the unity vector @xmath46 .",
    "this connects @xmath47 and @xmath45 as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the angle between the intensity gradient and the originally detected polarization orientations ( figure [ schematic_basics ] , see also figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath50 is the angle between the magnetic field and the intensity gradient orientations analyzed in the previous sections is always defined as the smaller of the 2 complementary angles to @xmath51 at the interception of field and intensity gradient orientations ; i.e. @xmath0 is always in the range between 0 and @xmath52 .",
    "absolute values are used in the equations here because @xmath0 can also be given a sense of orientation ( section [ section_delta_high_resolution ] ) . ] .",
    "we are now aiming at manipulating equation ( [ mhd_momentum ] ) in a way that changes / variations in the morphology in a map can be attributed to the various forces . in particular , we want to link the field tension along @xmath45 to morphological features .",
    "to that purpose , we are projecting @xmath45 onto the orthonormal system @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( figure [ schematic_basics ] ) , where @xmath55 is a unity vector tangential to the intensity contour .",
    "equation ( [ mhd_momentum ] ) can , thus , be written as :    @xmath56    equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) provides a direct interpretation for the angle @xmath2 , with some interesting insight which we are addressing in the following . without the field tension force , the above equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] )",
    "would describe the dynamics governed by only the gravitational force ( and a possible pressure gradient ) .",
    "the angle @xmath2 , with @xmath57 $ ] , quantifies the fraction of the available field tension along the density gradient direction .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 is a measure for how efficiently the magnetic field contributes to and is responsible for an observed density ( emission ) morphology along the gradient directions .    in the context of a collapsing system , @xmath58 measures how efficiently the magnetic field inhibits a collapse . in the extreme case where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , an observed density ( emission ) gradient is aligned with the field .",
    "consequently , for any field strength , the magnetic field does not influence the local structure along the density gradient direction . in a close - to - circular e2-type system ,",
    "the local dynamics along the gradient directions , i.e. in radial direction , proceed as if the field does not exist ( equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) ) .",
    "the dynamics in radial direction @xmath47 are entirely and only driven by the gravitational force @xmath61 ( with a likely negligible pressure gradient @xmath62 ) .",
    "in other words , in this situation the field plays a very minor role compared to gravity .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with our result in @xcite where the field - to - gravity force ratio @xmath1 is calculated to be @xmath63 in the e2 core .",
    "nevertheless , equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) shows that a tangential force component depending on field strength and curvature is also present . for pulled - in relatively straight field lines ,",
    "a small curvature ( large @xmath64 ) will suppress this component .",
    "closer to the center , an increasingly smaller curvature radius might lead to additional dynamics in tangential direction . in the other extreme case when @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , the magnetic field maximally contributes to an observed morphology along the density gradient direction .",
    "besides the orientation of the field with the density gradient , the absolute field strength is also relevant here . with @xmath67 , the field will always work against gravity , slowing down gravity in figure [ schematic_basics ] could also point in opposite direction if the field line is bent the other way .",
    "in such a case , the projection onto the same orthonormal system @xmath53 will lead to opposite signs in the equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) .",
    "this ambiguity can be overcome by introducing a sign for the field curvature , @xmath68 , for a convex or concave field shape .",
    "] at a maximum when @xmath69 . at such locations",
    "we would generally expect a density gradient that is less steep with emission contours that are spaced further apart .",
    "the tangential force component in equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) is negligible here",
    ".    in summary , different values in the angle @xmath2 reflect regions with different dynamics .",
    "the larger @xmath2 , the more important the field is dynamically in working against gravity .",
    "this is also consistent with a decreasing force ratio @xmath1 with smaller radius in a collapsing core as derived in @xcite .",
    "here , we provide a brief summary and comparison of the magnetic field parameters resulting from our work so far ( section [ comparison ] ) . besides the angle @xmath0 introduced in the previous section , we have already derived a technique to estimate the local magnetic field significance @xmath1 and the local field strength @xmath40 in @xcite . in section [ consistent_picture ]",
    "we demonstrate how these 2 different studies are connected . a detailed discussion on the relevant assumptions is given in appendix a.      the combination of the three parameters  @xmath58 , @xmath1 and @xmath40  characterizes and quantifies the local role of the magnetic field : @xmath71 where we have introduced the new symbols @xmath72 for the field deviation and @xmath73 for the gravity alignment deviation , @xmath74 being the angle between the intensity gradient and the gravity and/or pressure force orientation ( figure [ schematic_basics ] and figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the field strength @xmath40 and its relative significance @xmath1 compared to the gravity and/or pressure forces are analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we stress that both @xmath1 and @xmath70 rely only on measurable angles .",
    "thus , both parameters are independent of any mass and field strength assumptions and any further modeling of a molecular cloud .",
    "the two quantities are solely based on angles which reflect the field and dust morphologies that are the overall result of all the forces acting in the system .",
    "the relative field significance @xmath1 leads to the total field strength @xmath40 when adding the mass and density information .",
    "this breaks the degeneracy in the dimensionless scale - free quantities based on angles only , and connects them to each individual physical system .",
    "the order of magnitude of the field strength is , thus , largely determined by the mass , with @xmath1 quantifying the fraction of this mass that can be balanced by the field . whereas @xmath1 compares locally the field force to the other forces",
    ", @xmath70 measures how much of the maximally available field tension force is taking part in the dynamics along the gradient direction .",
    "thus , @xmath70 is constrained to an upper limit of 1 , whereas @xmath1 has no upper limit and can be larger than one if the field is dominating .",
    "table [ table_field_quantities ] compares the properties of these three field parameters .",
    "figure [ sigma_b_inter ] illustrates the connection between field and gravity deviations , @xmath70 and @xmath75 , and the field significance @xmath1 based on equation ( [ eq_sigma_b ] ) .",
    "small values in the deviation @xmath70  i.e. , close alignment between magnetic field and intensity gradient orientations  minimize the contribution of the field tension term along the density gradient direction in equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) .",
    "this is already suggestive for a rather minor role of the magnetic field in this situation .",
    "nevertheless , this criterion alone does not yet provide any information on the field compared to the other forces in equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) .",
    "this caveat is overcome with the field significance @xmath1 ( as a result from the polarization - intensity gradient method ) . and",
    "indeed , this reveals that the field significance scales roughly as @xmath76 for small values in @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for most of the parameter space , the field is indeed of minor importance compared to other forces ( figure [ sigma_b_inter ] ) . only for large values in @xmath77",
    ", @xmath1 can equal unity or become slightly larger .",
    "intuitively this is expected , because growing values in @xmath75 indicate larger deviations in the intensity gradient direction from the gravity center which have to be caused by a growing presence of the magnetic field .",
    "as @xmath70 grows , the field becomes more relevant for the dynamics along the density gradient direction in equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the field to take on a more important role in shaping and influencing an observed dust continuum morphology . additionally bringing in @xmath1",
    ", we can indeed confirm that the relative field significance @xmath1 is growing as @xmath78 for constant values in @xmath75 ( dotted magenta lines in figure [ sigma_b_inter ] ) .",
    "the larger @xmath75 already is , the faster @xmath1 passes unity . or , in other words , for any existing deviation in the intensity gradient from the gravity direction , an additionally growing deviation with the field orientation",
    "reflects a growing field importance .",
    "this growth in field significance , nevertheless , does not yet automatically mean that the field is dominating . the gray dotted line in figure [ sigma_b_inter ]",
    "separates the @xmath79- parameter space into @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "( except @xmath82 with @xmath83 ) is , strictly speaking , excluded because the method is failing here . ]    in summary , whereas @xmath84 in equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) is already indicative for the role of the magnetic field , @xmath1 further sharpens and quantifies this by additionally taking into account the information of the other forces in the system ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) .",
    "it has to be stressed that introducing @xmath58 in equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) and deriving @xmath1 with the polarization - intensity gradient method are two independent approaches . as a sole common ground ,",
    "they start with an ideal mhd force equation , but then proceed with two different assumptions .",
    "a comparison and validity of these two assumptions is given in appendix a.",
    "as explained in section [ interpretation ] , the angle @xmath0 can be directly linked to the ( projected ) mhd force equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the role and the significance of the magnetic field  the field tension in the rightmost term in equation ( [ mhd_momentum ] )  are not yet explicitly visible due to the ( unknown ) gravitational force term .",
    "additionally , the angle @xmath0 can be affected by projection effects .",
    "the magnetic field - to - gravitational force ratio @xmath1 ( section [ summary_parameters ] and @xcite ) can overcome these shortcomings and links the magnetic field tension to the gravity in a system via the polarization - intensity gradient method .",
    "moreover , projection effects are minimized in @xmath1 or even cancel out .    in the following sections",
    ", we further investigate the connection between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with the goal of establishing @xmath0 as a tracer for the change in the role of the magnetic field over an observed map .",
    "this is motivated by the aim of providing a simple tool ( @xmath2-map , section [ delta_observations ] ) to interpret polarization data .",
    "whereas calculating @xmath1 requires a more elaborate modeling , the angle @xmath0 can be readily read off from a map once intensity gradient orientations are derived . often , a simple inspection by eye will already allow for differentiating between clearly small or large @xmath0-values .",
    "this , in contrast , is non - trivial for @xmath1 .",
    "there is , thus , a substantial benefit from gaining further insight in @xmath0 and its deeper connection to @xmath1 .",
    "we start by addressing the concern of projection effects in @xmath0 . for any observable , projection effects cancel out when looking at the relative change ( logarithmic derivative ) of this observable . assuming the 3-dimensional ( lower index 3 )",
    "deprojected angle @xmath85 linked with an inclination angle @xmath86 to the projected 2-dimensional ( lower index 2 ) angle @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( see figure 13 in @xcite ) , we can write the logarithmic derivative : @xmath89 @xmath90 denotes the total differential , and we have assumed @xmath91 . in the previous section [ interpretation ] , lower indices",
    "2 were omitted for map - projected quantities . in practice , we are interested in changes in @xmath0 from one pixel to its neighboring pixels in a map , in order to assess the change in the role of the magnetic field .",
    "it is , thus , a very mild assumption to impose no change in the inclination angle , i.e. @xmath92 , between adjacent pixels . if necessary , this condition can be relaxed to @xmath93 or very small , which will still leave the above equation correct on a pixel - to - pixel basis , but would allow for a change in inclination from one end to another end in a map , if this should seem plausible .",
    "the logarithmic differential for the field significance @xmath1 , equation ( [ eq_sigma_b ] ) , can then be written as : @xmath94 where we have again omitted the lower indices 2 for the map - projected quantities @xmath75 and @xmath70 . in equation ( [ eq_diff_sigma ] )",
    "the magnetic field alignment deviation @xmath70 and the gravity alignment deviation @xmath75 are decoupled into additive terms quantifying their relative contributions to @xmath95 .",
    "we re - define their individual contributions as : @xmath96 where we have introduced the weight functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the magnetic field and gravity , respectively . a change in the field significance , @xmath99 ,",
    "generally depends on the 4 parameters @xmath70 , @xmath75 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume here first @xmath102 , i.e. we assume roughly similar ( small ) changes in the field and gravity alignment deviations from one pixel to the next one .",
    "this then allows us to simplify equation ( [ eq_diff_sigma ] ) to 2 variables and compare the weight functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 in their relevance for @xmath1 ( figure [ figure_weight_simple ] ) .",
    "this leads to some remarkable insight : ( 1 ) for any values in @xmath75 , small values in @xmath70 ( small values in @xmath0 ) always mean that the magnetic field is irrelevant for a change in @xmath1 .",
    "a change in @xmath1 is dominated by gravity and for @xmath105 the field is not important and thus , @xmath106 .",
    "( 2 ) for any value in @xmath75 , and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , the magnetic field is less important or at most equally important to a change in @xmath1 .",
    "( 3 ) for values @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , the magnetic field can ( but does not necessarily ) dominate gravity . if @xmath101 and @xmath100 are known , the weight functions in figure [ figure_weight_simple ] can accordingly be shifted vertically .",
    "the above conclusions compare magnetic field and gravity force .",
    "we can additionally formulate 2 consequences from figure [ figure_weight_simple ] for the magnetic field separately : ( 1 ) small values in @xmath70 ( small values in @xmath2 ) _ always minimize _ the field contribution to @xmath95 .",
    "( 2 ) large values in @xmath70 ( large values in @xmath2 ) _ always maximize _ its contribution .",
    "this is true for any values in @xmath75 and @xmath101 .",
    "we have to acknowledge that most of the above conclusions can also be found from @xmath1 ( equation ( [ eq_sigma_b ] ) ) .",
    "what have we gained from further analyzing the above logarithmic differential ?",
    "we recall that we are aiming at establishing @xmath2-maps as a tracer for the change in the role of the magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , the weight function @xmath97 is close to @xmath2 ( @xmath111 ) , only with an additional factor @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath113 , @xmath58 thus always provides a lower limit to a change in the field significance ( blue dashed line in figure [ figure_weight_simple ] ) . for values",
    "@xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , @xmath58 is even accurate to within about 25% of @xmath103 .",
    "the logarithmic differential in equation ( [ eq_diff_sigma ] ) has , therefore , allowed us to explicitly put @xmath2 in relation with the projection - free quantity @xmath95 , thus establishing @xmath2 as a valid approximation for it .    in summary , whatever the value for @xmath116 , @xmath117 can always be approximated with @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath2-maps by themselves  despite possibly being affected by projection effects",
    " already reflect the change in the role of the magnetic field in a system .",
    "an increase ( decrease ) in @xmath2 will indicate an increase ( decrease ) in @xmath1 , and thus , point toward a growing ( diminishing ) significance of the field as compared to gravity .",

    "the @xmath125-plot shows a linear relation up to @xmath126 , with an exponentially growing field significance @xmath1 for the largest deviations around 80 - 90@xmath9 .",
    "this is expected because large values in @xmath2 will boost @xmath127 in @xmath1 .",
    "contrary to mon r2 and w51 e2 where maximum values in @xmath1 are around 1 and 1.5 , m@xmath3 reveals a much more dominating field in most areas .",

    "we , therefore , conclude that @xmath2 indeed can trace the change in the magnetic field significance .",

    "this is a consequence of the missing information from the angle @xmath74 ( and some possibly related projection effect ) when looking at @xmath2 only .",
    "this explains and defines the dispersion in @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath2-value . due to this scatter",

    "changes of @xmath2 over an entire source , nevertheless , show an overall positive correlation with @xmath1 and , therefore , reliably describe the varying role of the magnetic field with position .",
    "an identical analysis of a larger sample of 24 cso sources @xcite is presented in appendix b. in the large majority of these sources , features in @xmath1-maps are also reflected in @xmath2-maps .",
    "occasional incomplete polarization coverages can limit this resemblance . from the total sample of 31 sources  27 from the cso and 4 from the sma  we arrive at a main conclusion : changes in the field significance @xmath1 are revealed by changes in the angle @xmath2 . on average , larger angles",

    "figure [ sigma_b_check ] and appendix b demonstrate and confirm the expected connection between @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in the following ,",
    "we now propose an evolutionary scenario , across which the role of the magnetic field can be assessed with the angle @xmath2 .",
    "similarities and analogous features are apparent between @xmath2-maps ( figure [ figure_delta_scales ] and [ figure_delta_scales_cont ] ) and @xmath1-maps ( figure [ sigma_b_check ] ) . in figure [ figure_schematic_delta ]",
    "we adopt co@xmath4- , m@xmath5- , m@xmath3- , mon r2- and w51 e2-type sources as prototype sources with clear @xmath2- ( and consequently @xmath1- ) structures .",
    "the competition between the magnetic field tension and other forces is reflected in distinct @xmath2-patches . in an early phase  labeled as ( i ) in figure [ figure_schematic_delta ]  larger scale dynamics in the surroundings lead to initial mass shuffling , leading to density contrasts but not yet well - defined shapes with clear gravity centers .",
    "patches with different @xmath2-values appear .",
    "the absence of clear gravity centers leads to more random - like @xmath2-structures that are less organized without clear symmetry features .",
    "nevertheless , areas with small ( large ) @xmath2 point toward a minor ( dominant ) role of the magnetic field compared to other forces like gravity and/or pressure gradients . on these largest scales in ( i ) , some regions might already reveal themselves as to what type of magnetic field - density configuration they will develop into .",
    "the dotted squares in ( i ) illustrate areas that are likely to evolve into ( iia ) and ( iib ) in a later phase .",
    "elongated structures of two types can be formed , with either a mean magnetic field orientation roughly perpendicular ( iia ) or roughly parallel ( iib ) to the density major axis .",
    "one can speculate that certain initial configurations in ( i ) will either preferentially lead to ( iia ) or ( iib ) : gravity possibly has just started to shape the ( iia)-precursor region , whereas large - scale flows and/or turbulence seem more plausible to create the elongated structure in the ( iib)-precursor region with the field being compressed perpendicular to its mean orientation . for any of these two regions , gravity is growing more important in ( iia ) and ( iib ) as the field lines are being pulled in . due to the different initial configurations",
    ", @xmath2-maps will reveal opposite trends here .",
    "the largest deviations in ( iia ) are found at the two ends of the dust emission major axis where the field maximally resists gravity . the field significance @xmath1 is maximum here . on the other hand , the same areas in ( iib )",
    "show field orientations that are closely aligned with the dust emission gradients , minimizing @xmath2 and @xmath1 . outside of these areas ,",
    "@xmath1 is growing and diminishing in ( iib ) and ( iia ) , respectively .",
    "as gravity leads to further contraction , these elongated structures are more symmetrized in ( iii ) .",
    "areas with large and small @xmath2 move closer together .",
    "zones with maximum @xmath2- and @xmath1-values are likely shrunk and moved closer to the center ( yellow dashed patches in ( iii ) ) , leaving more field lines closer to radial directions ( green dashed patches in ( iii ) ) . in this way , the initially different configurations ( iia ) and ( iib ) might evolve into one and the same system ( iii ) .",
    "this ( smaller - scale ) system can then be further analyzed using the symmetry properties of @xmath0 ( including its sign ) as introduced in section [ section_delta_high_resolution ] .",
    "thus , in this sequence of evolution , symmetries , features and changes in @xmath2 ( and @xmath0 ) reveal the role of the magnetic field . a minor or dominant role of the field can be classified via @xmath2 .",
    "a more quantitative estimate is achieved via @xmath1 .",
    "many of the additional sources presented in appendix b can be categorized as ( iia ) or ( iib ) . essentially no source is found that qualifies as ( iii ) because the cso   20   resolution typically does not fully reveal the densest core structures .",
    "we note that a thorough analysis of mean polarization orientations versus source shapes is presented in @xcite . whereas in their work differences in mean orientations are compared with the source aspect ratios , we are making use of the @xmath2-distributions . by looking at broad features in these distributions ",
    "i.e. , peaking toward small values versus peaking toward large values  a simple bimodal categorization is possible . offsets of roughly perpendicular or roughly parallel can still be identified with a peak and can , therefore , still be categorized as ( iia ) and ( iib ) .",

    "based on the observed angle @xmath0 between magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations , we propose a generally valid interpretation for the role of the magnetic field .",
    "this then further leads to a schematic scenario for the magnetic field in the evolutionary phases from large - scale systems to collapsing cores .",
    "the key points are summarized in the following .    1 .",
    "_ observed angle @xmath2 : _ magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations are observed to show distinct patterns and symmetry features .",
    "this is both found in lower- resolution cso and higher - resolution ( sub-)arcsecond sma data .",
    "the angle @xmath2 between these two orientations is straightforward to observe , does not rely on any modeling and can often already be estimated by eye .",
    "@xmath2-histograms and correlation coefficients reflect ensemble - averaged properties and differences .",
    "2 .   _ observed high - resolution cores : _ sma high - resolution ( collapsing ) cores reveal additional symmetry properties in @xmath0 when taking into account the relative orientation between magnetic field and dust emission gradient .",
    "these features can be explained assuming a core with accretion and outflow zones .",
    "these findings seem to be preserved even in the presence of possibly unknown projection effects .",
    "@xmath2 in the mhd force equation : _ when identifying an observed intensity gradient orientation with the density gradient orientation in the mhd force equation , the magnetic field tension force term can be written with an additional factor @xmath58 .",
    "the angle @xmath2 then measures to what extent the field tension force contributes to an observed density gradient .",
    "thus , @xmath58 can be interpreted as a field alignment deviation or a field deviation efficiency .",
    "@xmath2-map tracer : _ taking into account projection effects , it can be demonstrated that a @xmath2-map always yields an approximation ( lower limit to the magnetic field weight function @xmath103 ) to the more elaborate @xmath1-map which fully quantifies the magnetic field significance .",
    "moreover , we show in practice , that positional changes in a @xmath2-map closely reflect changes in a @xmath1-map .",
    "therefore , we generally propose @xmath2-maps as reliable tracers for the change in the role of the magnetic field over an observed map .",
    "_ schematic evolutionary scenario : _ symmetries and features in @xmath2-maps ( and consequently in @xmath1-maps ) evolve from larger - scale cloud complexes to collapsing cores . on the largest scales ,",
    "apparently random @xmath2-patches are found which point toward a variable magnetic field influence . in a next phase ,",
    "elongated structures appear with a mean field orientation either roughly parallel or orthogonal to the major axis of the structure .",
    "the field is here more dominant toward either the center or toward the two ends of the major axis . in a later third phase",
    ", gravity leads to less elongated but more symmetrized ( collapsing ) cores . here , @xmath0 can reveal zones of accretion and outflows .",

    "the derivation of the angle @xmath0 in equation ( [ mhd_delta_vect ] ) with its interpretation as field alignment deviation ( equation ( [ eq_delta_align ] ) ) is based on identifying an observed intensity gradient direction with the density gradient direction .",
    "this might seem at odds with the assumption in @xcite , where the intensity gradient is identified with the orientation of the inertial term on the left - hand side in the mhd force equation ( [ mhd_momentum ] ) .",
    "the assumption in @xcite is phenomenologically motivated , by picturing a gradient in emission as a consequence of accumulating and compressing material .",
    "such a process is the result of all the combined forces acting in a molecular cloud and is , therefore , measured with the inertial term .",
    "the assumption then states that the emission gradient must have some of this information of the inertial term encrypted in its direction .",
    "we stress that  in both the derivation of the force ratio @xmath1 and the local field strength ",
    "only the direction of the emission gradient but not its magnitude is relevant .    in the following we compare these two assumptions  ( a ) emission gradient direction measures density gradient direction and ( b ) emission gradient direction is a measure for inertial term direction  by further analyzing the inertial term in equation ( [ mhd_momentum ] ) .",
    "we assume stationarity , i.e. @xmath131 .",

    "this then leads to : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the absolute value of the velocity @xmath39 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side depends on the curl of the velocity field . for a curl - free flow or for a curl small compared to a density change over the resolution of an observation , this term can be neglected . otherwise , the curl of a velocity field being along the rotation axis that is normal to the plane where the velocities change , the direction of the term @xmath140 is in the plane of the velocity flow .",
    "the second term describes a change in ram pressure .",
    "the change along a density gradient direction is measured with the third term .",
    "based on equation ( [ eq_inertial ] ) we can now distinguish two main situations first : ( i ) _ the velocity field has a negligible curl and the velocity is aligned with the density gradient : _ a density change occurs along a velocity direction .",
    "the direction of the inertial term follows the density gradient .",

    "turbulence can exist up to a level such that a dominating organized bulk flow ( in a resolution element ) can still be identified . ] .",
    "we additionally make use of the continuity equation with @xmath143 , thus giving @xmath144 . introducing the angle @xmath145 between the velocity and the density gradient directions ( figure [ schematic_inertial ] ) together with again approximating the differential operators in the continuity equation with the resolution elements @xmath132 , leads to @xmath146 .",
    "this relation states that any relative change in velocity ( relative to the absolute velocity ) is balanced by a relative change in density modulo the alignment factor @xmath147 .",
    "this then allows us to express the above approximation in terms of @xmath148 only : @xmath149 .",

    "in particular , the direction of the inertial term  which is relevant for the polarization- intensity gradient method  is now linked to the density gradient and the velocity direction with the expression in square brackets .",
    "we now investigate this term further , with the goal of quantifying the resulting deviation @xmath150 from the direction of the density gradient @xmath47 ( figure [ schematic_inertial ] ) .",
    "the alignment angle @xmath145 between @xmath47 and @xmath151 is in the range of 0 to 90@xmath9 .",

    "figure [ fig_eps_eta ] displays the inertial term deviation @xmath150 from the density gradient as a function of @xmath145 . for @xmath145 within @xmath154 ,",
    "the maximum deviation is about @xmath155 with an average of @xmath156 .",
    "these relatively small deviations are a consequence of the continuity equation which controls the magnitude @xmath152 along the velocity direction @xmath151 . for angles @xmath157 , the deviation @xmath150 grows linearly to a maximum of @xmath158 where @xmath151 is orthogonal to @xmath47 ( red regime in figure [ fig_eps_eta ] ) .",
    "the overall average deviation , including extreme values @xmath157 , is @xmath159 .",
    "the analysis here makes clear that the possible difference between velocity and density gradient directions plays a major role in how closely the two assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) agree .",
    "the presence of a significant velocity curl in equation ( [ eq_inertial ] ) might lead to an additional more complicated dependence of @xmath150 on @xmath145 .",
    "we are not attempting to quantify this here .",
    "further investigations via numerical simulations will be more appropriate to tackle down the detailed influence of a curl term .",
    "we are , thus , left with average deviations of about @xmath156 to about @xmath160 between a measured emission gradient direction and the inertial term direction .",
    "these are conservative estimates while assuming no significant velocity curl over a beam - averaged resolution element .",
    "we now recall that uncertainties in polarization position angles from observations are typically in the range of about 5 to @xmath161 .",

    "additional statistical uncertainties in the field orientation resulting from turbulent dispersion are also around 5 to @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that adopting the emission gradient orientation is a reasonably good approximation for the orientation of the inertial term in the polarization  intensity gradient method .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of other ( statistical ) uncertainties , the overall error budget is not significantly affected .    finally , we propagate the uncertainty in the orientation of the inertial term , i.e. , the deviation @xmath150 , through to the magnetic field significance @xmath1 and the field strength @xmath40 . to that purpose",

    "<S> dust polarization observations from the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) are analyzed with the goal of providing a general tool to interpret the role of the magnetic field in molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations are observed to show distinct patterns and features . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath0 between these two orientations can be interpreted as a magnetic field alignment deviation , assuming the emission gradient orientation to coincide with the density gradient orientation in the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) force equation . in sma high - resolution ( collapsing ) cores , additional symmetry properties in @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> can reveal accretion and outflow zones . </S>",
    "<S> all these observational findings suggest the angle @xmath0 to be a relevant quantity that can assess the role of the magnetic field . indeed , when comparing this angle with the ( projection - free ) magnetic field significance @xmath1 @xcite , it is demonstrated that @xmath2 yields an approximation to the change in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , changes in the magnetic field alignment deviation @xmath0 trace changes in the role of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath0 is observationally straightforward to determine , providing a tool to distinguish between zones of minor or significant magnetic field impact . </S>",
    "<S> this is exemplified by the cso m@xmath3 , mon r2 , co@xmath4 , m@xmath5 sources and by the sma high - resolution data from w51 e2 , w51 north , orion bn / kl and g5.89 . </S>",
    "<S> additional cso sources are analyzed , providing further support of this result . </S>",
    "<S> finally , based on the different features found in our sample of 31 sources in total , covering sizes from large - scale complexes to collapsing cores , a schematic evolutionary scenario is proposed . here </S>",
    "<S> , the significance of the magnetic field evolves both with position and scale , and can be assessed with the angle @xmath0 . </S>"
