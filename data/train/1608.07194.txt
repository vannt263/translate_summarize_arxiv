    "we use supersymmetric method @xcite to prove the occurrence of ` chiral symmetry recovery ' in paired weyl point problem taking into account internode scattering.the key step in this proof is to define ` composite spinor ' that combines the left - handed and right - handed weyl fermion spinor together.they are given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the @xmath123 in the right - left node ( r - l ) space.the hamiltonian with both intranode and internode disorder potentials is given by    @xmath124+\\sigma_{\\mu}v^{(2)}_{\\mu}(\\mathbf{r})\\tau^x\\ ] ]    where we have two independent intranode disorder potentials @xmath125 and one internode disorder potential @xmath126 which are of white noise character and gaussian correlated.that is , they satisfy @xmath127,@xmath128 , where @xmath129 and we furthermore have assumed isotropic correlation where @xmath130 is independent of spatial direction @xmath131.furthermore , @xmath132 where @xmath23 is density of states at fermi energy and @xmath133 is the intranode or internode scattering - determined mean free time.the intranode scattering strength is assumed to be the same between the left and right weyl nodes.defining 8-spinor for each of the right - handed and left - handed fermions consisting of sublattice space , retarded and advanced space , and boson - fermion space , and taking average over the disorders , we obtain the corresponding action    @xmath134=\\int d^dr [ -i\\overline{\\psi}_r \\left(-\\eta_rv_f\\sigma\\cdot i\\nabla+\\mu+v_f\\sigma\\cdot\\mathbf{k}_0 + \\frac{(\\omega+i\\delta)}{2}\\lambda-\\varepsilon+\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\right ) \\psi_r\\ ] ] @xmath135 @xmath136\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is energy , @xmath137 , @xmath29 in the retarded - advanced space , and the terms involving @xmath138 and @xmath139 are introduced to break the symmetry in this space.in eq.([fullfermionaction ] ) , we retain only momentum - conserving 4-fermion terms since we have no density wave ordered state that can scatter fermions with nonzero net momentum change.the action in terms of the composite spinor is given by    @xmath140=\\int d^dr \\left[-i\\overline{\\psi}\\left(-v_f\\sigma\\cdot i\\nabla+(\\mu+v_f\\sigma\\cdot\\mathbf{k}_0 + \\frac{(\\omega+i\\delta)}{2}\\lambda-\\varepsilon+\\frac{\\omega}{2})\\tau^z\\right)\\psi + ( \\overline{\\psi}a\\psi)(\\overline{\\psi}b\\psi)\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are @xmath143 matrices , chosen carefully to match the the 4-fermion terms in the action eq.([fullfermionaction]).the task is to determine these matrices.while the general case with arbitrary intranode and internode scattering strengths @xmath144 and @xmath145 is formidable to solve , a particularly simplifying situation is when one considers @xmath146.in this case , we can solve for the matrices @xmath141 and @xmath142 explicitly and obtain    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is identity matrix in the node space.considering the time - reversal symmetry - preserving scalar potential disorder @xmath149 , the fermion action becomes @xmath140=\\int d^dr [ -i\\overline{\\psi}\\left(-v_f\\sigma\\cdot i\\nabla-\\tilde{\\varepsilon}\\tau^z\\right)\\psi + \\frac{1}{2}g(\\overline{\\psi}\\psi)^2]\\ ] ] where @xmath150 , which can be easily decoupled using hubbard - stratonovich transformation.following the standard derivation of supersymmetric nlsm @xcite , straightforward calculation gives @xmath151=k_{\\mathrm{susy}}\\int d^3r\\mathrm{str}\\left[(\\nabla q)^2\\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath152\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath38 , and now @xmath40 is a @xmath153 matrix due to the addition of node space while the coefficient is twice that of single - node problem presented in eq.([nlsm ] ) in the main text.in obtaining eqs.([nlsm ] ) and ( [ nlsmpair ] ) , we have set the r - a symmetry - breaking parameters @xmath154 to zero once that symmetry is broken and validates our nlsm derivation.we note again that the resulting nlsm no longer displays the chirality factor @xmath8 since it appears as @xmath155 via @xmath156.even more remarkably , the effective nlsm for this paired weyl point problem takes precisely the same form as that for single weyl point problem.this is what one will also get from a pair of dirac points in 3d at energy - momentum @xmath1.so , we have proven the ` chiral symmetry recovery ' phenomenon both at the independent weyl node limit @xmath157 ( applies to perfectly smooth infinite - range disorder ) and the strong internode scattering limit @xmath146 ( applies to wildly oscillating zero - range disorder).by interpolation , physically realistic cases where @xmath158 and fall between the two extreme limits should also display such ` chiral symmetry recovery ' phenomenon.this completes the proof .",

    "this mechanism localization driven by proliferation of topological defects is also related to the physics of confinement where , in 2 + 1-d compact qed for example , the proliferation of instantons restores the symmetry , lifts the ground state degeneracy , and finally confines the fermions ; the ` quarks ' of the electronic system @xcite , into a state which corresponds to the anderson localized insulating state.this also corresponds to the asymptotically free theory in the short distance ( high energy ) regime @xcite@xcite.it has been shown in @xcite that this asymptotic freedom holds generally for nlsms with local gauge invariance and symmetric space manifold , which directly gives rise to confinement in 2d.therefore in 2d , the effect of vortices certainly can not be neglected and the localization - delocalization property of the disordered electronic system depends on the balance between the vortices effect and the topological @xmath0 term effect.we found that for the wsm in the wigner - dyson orthogonal class ai we are considering here , the nlsm manifold , which involves symplectic group of matrices , also forms symmetric space and so one expects to have anderson localization into insulating state when the vortex loops proliferate.as we have argued in the main text , this topological defect - driven localization requires finite concentration of vortex loop to onset and does not take effect at weak disorder , explaining the stability of diffusive metallic phase in disordered wsm found in numerics.our theory applies to wsms belonging to the wigner - dyson orthogonal class ai , with time - reversal and spin - rotational symmetries @xcite and where the chirality comes from broken inversion symmetry.it is to be noted that the class ai has no topological invariant in all space dimensions @xmath188 , implying either topological term with non - quantized coefficient for each weyl node or the absence of topological @xmath0 term even for a single weyl node ( @xmath189).in such case , the topological @xmath0-term - induced delocalization effect is ineffective and one has to invoke alternative mechanism to explain the robustness of time - reversal symmetric 3d weyl semimetal against weak disorder.the berry phase and nonperturbative effects are what we have basically proposed for this ."

    "<S> _ weyl semimetal ( wsm ) is a new class of three dimensional materials with topologically protected gapless isolated points as its fermi surface with relativistic linear dispersion spectrum and well - defined chirality for each weyl point.the concept of weyl fermions arose in the context of high energy ( elementary particle ) physics from the solutions of the massless dirac equation with definite chirality.according to berry phase theory @xcite , the weyl points are berry charge monopoles in momentum space @xcite with opposite signs for weyl points of opposite chiralities.the topological protection arises from the fact that the monopole charges of opposite signs can only be created or annihilated in pairs.wsm is characterized by unique response properties in the form of chiral magnetic effect arising from the phenomenon of axial anomaly between two weyl points of opposite chiralities , surface fermi arc @xcite , and anomalous hall effect @xcite which gives rise to new transport properties @xcite.in realistic situations , candidate materials hosting weyl points always contain a finite amount of disorder.recent theoretical and numerical studies of disordered wsm uncovered a number of new phases with interesting transport and critical properties.one of the important issues is the occurrence and nature of anderson localization @xcite in this system .    </S>",
    "<S> the chirality of weyl fermion is the special feature of this relativistic fermion , which distinguishes it from the chirally symmetric dirac fermion.this chirality has been argued to give rise to topological protection mechanism against anderson localization in disordered wsm via the presence of topological @xmath0 term accompanying the nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) @xcite , in analogy to the physics of quantum hall effect @xcite@xcite.this protection mechanism is effective in the large distance scales valid in the presence of sufficiently smooth disorder or disorder with long enough range , such that the internode scattering can be neglected.renormalization group ( rg ) study @xcite@xcite and numerical calculations @xcite indeed observed robust conducting state at weak disorder , in the form of ` diffusive metallic ' state.this was also confirmed by boltzman equation and self - consistent born approximation calculations @xcite@xcite@xcite.however , numerics also found insulating anderson localized phase at strong enough disorder @xcite in model with pair(s ) of weyl points .    in this paper , we will first demonstrate using supersymmetric method that the chirality of wsm does not appear in the nlsm upon averaging over disorder , giving rise to the field theory of effectively chirally symmetric disordered dirac fermion system.we show this both in the case of independent weyl nodes as well as that with node mixing.this ` chiral symmetry recovery ' suggests eventual perishing of the delocalization effects of any net topological @xmath0 term of paired chiral weyl points , at least at short enough length scales.then , using replica formulation of nlsm , we analyze the nonperturbative effect in the form of vortex loop proliferation on the disordered wsm which provides another mechanism that drives localization.we next consider the effects of the weyl points intrinsic berry phase as well as that of the vortex loops on the localization physics.we will show that while all the above effects tend to drive localization , there exists an important opposing mechanism against localization that comes from the berry phase - induced destructive interference between the vortex loops and between the particle scattering paths , that could explain the robustness of wsm at weak disorder @xcite.we consider time - reversal invariant wsm with chirality coming from broken inversion symmetry ( parity ) , without magnetic order and with no or negligible spin - orbit coupling.the absence of inversion symmetry naturally gives rise to berry phase effect @xcite.finally , we suggest that the chiral symmetry recovery is a consistent explanation for the recent observed absence of chiral anomaly in a noncentrosymmetric wsm .    _ symmetry and field theory : chiral symmetry recovery in disordered wsm . </S>",

    "<S> _ we have discussed the role of nonperturbative effect in the form of topological vortex loop excitations and their berry phase in the localization physics in the transport property of disordered 3d time - reversal invariant weyl semimetals.one might wonder the origin of these vortex line excitations.we would like to argue that they arise from the berry magnetic charges of the pair of weyl points.such a pair of weyl points in @xmath118-space corresponds to a magnetic dipole in this space , formed by berry magnetic charges of opposite signs.consequently , such berry magnetic dipole in @xmath118-space corresponds to a distribution of berry magnetic dipoles in real space.for pair(s ) of weyl points of opposite chiralities , the average magnetic charge density over real space is zero in the bulk giving rise to constructive interference between scattering trajectories , thus strengthening the anderson localization effect.but there are also nonperturbative topological excitations of the nlsm ; the vortex lines , whether open or closed ones , forming vortex loops.the open vortex line is basically an open chain of such magnetic dipoles , where they form a string with nonzero net magnetic flux along it , while vortex loop corresponds to a closed chain version of that.noteworthy , this picture implies that our vortex loops are fermionic as their quantum statistics , which prevents them from proliferating ( condensing ) individually but may do so in pairs.we have however shown that the berry phase of the vortex loops in noncentrosymmetric wsm generally leads to destructive interference between the vortex loops themselves as well as between the particle scattering paths , thus impeding the localization .    </S>",
