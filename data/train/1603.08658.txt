    "the `` top - down '' route  from classical gravity to quantum structure of spacetime  is what i will follow from the next section onwards .",
    "but it is useful to summarize the `` bottom - up '' picture which emerges from this description so that the broader perspective remains in focus .",
    "the purpose of this introductory section is to do this , postponing the details of arguments and mathematical proofs to later sections .    a fundamental quantity in the description of , say , a fluid is the distribution function @xmath2 which _ counts _ the number of atoms @xmath3 per unit phase space volume @xmath4 .",

    "the description in terms of a distribution function is remarkable because it allows us to use the continuum language and  at the same time  recognize the discrete nature of the fluid . as the number of _ degrees of freedom _ per unit phase space volume or even as the _ probability _ of occupation of a given phase space volume .",

    "( this should be obvious .",
    "i will describe a somewhat more general result in sec .",
    "[ sec : vpg ] ) it will turn out that , in the classical limit , @xmath41 can indeed be interpreted as the rate of heating per unit area of a null surface , thereby making this a thermodynamical variational principle , for the fluid we call spacetime .",
    "this alternate perspective resonates well with several peculiar features of gravity , especially the connection with horizon thermodynamics .",
    "i will also show that this approach offers fresh insights into the  problem and , in fact , allows us to determine its numerical value quite accurately .",

    "i shall now describe the details of this formalism starting from classical gravity and working towards deeper layers .    the field equation in einstein s gravity is usually expressed in terms of @xmath42 in the form @xmath43 this is what you learn in standard textbooks .",
    "but there are two other  and as i will argue , nicer  ways of writing the gravitational field equation .",
    "the first alternative is to introduce a timelike , normalized vector field @xmath44 ( which could be thought of as the four - velocity of a fiducial observer ) and demand that the equation @xmath45 holds for _ all _ observers .",
    "this demand , of course , can be met only if holds and we recover the standard result .",
    "the second alternative is to introduce a _ null _ vector field @xmath46 ( which could be thought of as a normal to a null surface in the spacetime ) and demand that the equation @xmath47 holds for all null vectors @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to the result @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant . )",
    "implies @xmath50 . taking the divergence and using the facts that @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "tells you that @xmath53 a constant , leading to .",
    "it is sometimes claimed that the bianchi identity @xmath54 _ implies _ @xmath55 . but @xmath56 can be defined through the variation of the matter lagrangian with respect to arbitrary coordinate transformations @xmath57 .",
    "its conservation , @xmath58 , in cartesian coordinates in local inertial frames , becomes @xmath55 in curvilinear coordinates .",
    "the principle of equivalence now demands the validity of this condition in an arbitrary curved spacetime .",
    "that is , you can _ derive _ @xmath51 without using the bianchi identity or the field equations .",
    "it is , therefore , more appropriate to think of the bianchi identity as _ being consistent _ with @xmath55 rather than _ implying _ it .",
    "] so , also leads to but with a crucial difference : it allows for a cosmological constant @xmath49 to arise as an integration constant to the field equation .    while all the three formulations are algebraically equivalent , they are conceptually very different .",
    "two such differences between and either of or are immediately noticeable .",
    "first , and involve additional vector fields but are scalar equations .",
    "they contain the same information content as the ten tensor components of because we demand them to hold for _ all _ @xmath44 or all @xmath59 .",
    "if you think of @xmath44 as a four velocity of an observer , then is a statement about the equality of two quantities which this observer measures in the matter sector and the geometrical sector .",
    "such a statement , invoking a class of observers , is similar in spirit to the way we obtain the kinematics of gravity ( `` how gravity makes matter move '' ) by introducing special relativity in the coordinate frames adapted to the freely falling observers .",
    "second , nobody has come up with a physical meaning for the text book field equation , expressed in the form . the right hand side , of course ,",
    "has the physical meaning as the energy momentum tensor but not the left hand side . in the conventional approach",
    ", we actually do not have a _ mechanism _ which tells us how @xmath60 ends up curving the spacetime .",
    "the relation @xmath61 equates apples and oranges ; the left hand side is purely geometrical while the right hand side is made of matter which we know has a large number of discrete ( quantum ) degrees of freedom . in the right hand side but that is hardly appropriate as a fundamental description and provides us with no useful insights . ]",
    "an equation of the kind , @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) , on the other hand , is conceptually better in this regard . we can hope to interpret both sides independently and",
    "think of this equation as a balancing act performed by spacetime .",
    "as we shall see , a description is reinforced by the extremum principle in which both @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be thought of as distorting the value of @xmath28 from unity , with the gravitational field equations restoring the value @xmath67 on - shell .",
    "much of the later sections of this article will be devoted to providing the physical meaning for the left hand side of which will turn out to be thermodynamic in nature . in short , and possess nicer physical interpretations than .      before proceeding further",
    ", i will provide a straightforward derivation and interpretation of showing how einstein could have obtained this equation instead of ( thereby saving us a lot of trouble ! ) .",
    "what einstein was looking for was a generalization of the field equation for gravity in newtonian theory .",
    "the dynamics of newtonian gravity is governed by the poisson equation @xmath68 which relates the gravitational potential @xmath69 to the mass density @xmath24 .",
    "when we move on to general relativity , the principle of equivalence identifies the gravitational potential with a component of the metric tensor through @xmath70 so that the poisson equation can be formally written as @xmath71 where @xmath24 is identified with the time - time component @xmath72 of the divergence - free , second rank symmetric energy momentum tensor @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath74 is not lorentz invariant , one might think ( alas , wrongly ! ) that it is preferable to `` generalize '' the @xmath74 to @xmath75 so that the left hand side has second derivatives in _ both space and time_. the second derivatives of the metric tensor can be expressed covariantly in terms of the curvature tensor , which led einstein to look for a divergence - free , second rank symmetric tensor to replace @xmath76 in the left hand side .",
    "after several false starts , he came up with and postulated it to be the field equation .    but",
    "einstein could have taken a different , and better , route !",
    "one can come up with a relativistic generalization of newton s law of gravity @xmath77 , _ retaining the right hand side as it is and without introducing second time derivatives in the left hand side_.    to do this , notice that : ( i ) the energy density @xmath78 , which appears in the right hand side , is foliation / observer dependent where @xmath44 is the four velocity of an observer .",
    "there is no way you can keep @xmath44 out of it and you should accept it as a fact of life . ( ii ) since @xmath79 plays the role of @xmath80 , a covariant scalar which generalizes the left hand side , @xmath81 , could indeed come from the curvature tensor  which contains the second derivatives of the metric .",
    "but , you need to find a generalization _ which depends on the four - velocity @xmath44 of the observer _ because the right hand side does",
    ". a purely geometrical object ( like e.g. @xmath82 ) , wo nt do .",
    "( iii ) it is , of course , perfectly acceptable for the left hand side _ not _ to have second _ time _ derivatives of the metric , in the rest frame of the observer , since they do not occur in @xmath81 .    to obtain a scalar with _ spatial _ second derivatives which depends on @xmath44 ( to replace @xmath81 ) ,",
    "we first project the indices of @xmath83 to the space orthogonal to @xmath44 , using the projection tensor @xmath84 , thereby obtaining the tensor @xmath85 .",
    "the only scalar we can construct from @xmath86 is @xmath87 where @xmath88 can be thought of as the radius of curvature of the space . and",
    "@xmath88 should _ not _ to be confused with the curvature tensor @xmath89 and the ricci scalar @xmath90 of the 3-space orthogonal to @xmath44 . ] the natural generalization of @xmath77",
    "is then given by @xmath91 .",
    "working out the left hand side ( see e.g. , p. 259 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one finds that @xmath92 which is exactly !",
    "thus , tells you that the square of the radius of curvature of space is proportional to the reciprocal of the energy density , thereby giving a geometrical meaning to the left hand side .",
    "is also closely related to the adm hamiltonian in the conventional approach .",
    "but this is a _ dynamical _ interpretation and not a _",
    "geometrical _ one .",
    "as i will argue , we have gone wrong conceptually in thinking of the metric tensor as a fundamental dynamical variable and erecting a structure around this assumption . also note that these ideas generalize in a simple manner to all lanczos - lovelock  models of gravity @xcite and are not limited to einstein s theory . in this article , however , i will concentrate on einstein gravity . ]      as i said , all the three formulations  based on , and  lead to the same algebraic consequences for classical gravity .",
    "that is , once you specify @xmath73 ( and @xmath49 in case of ) and solve the resulting differential equations , you will end up with the same spacetime geometry and same observable consequences .",
    "this raises the question : is there a physical principle which will allow us to distinguish between , and , selecting one of them as the correct approach ?",
    "there is indeed one which will be the cornerstone of the approach i describe in this article .",
    "recall that the equations of motion for matter , derived from an action principle , remain invariant if you add a constant to the matter lagrangian , _",
    "i.e. _ , under the change @xmath93 constant .",
    "this encodes the principle that the dynamics is immune to the shift in the the zero level of energy density .",
    "motivated by this fact , it is reasonable to postulate that the gravitational field equations should also preserve this symmetry , which is already present in the matter sector . since the energy momentum tensor @xmath73 will occur , in one form or another , as the source for gravity ( as can be argued from the principle of equivalence and considerations of the newtonian limit ) , this leads to the postulate :    * the extremum principle that determines the spacetime dynamics ( and hence the field equations ) must remain invariant under the change @xmath94 ( constant ) @xmath95 .",
    "this principle immediately rules out and as possible choices for the field equation and selects as the correct choice ; indeed , remains invariant under the shift @xmath94 ( constant ) @xmath95 because @xmath96 for a null vector .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the guiding principle which i will@xcite take as my basic postulate .",
    "this principle will turn out to be as powerful in determining the gravitational dynamics as the principle of equivalence was in determining the gravitational kinematics .",
    "i will begin by exploring its consequences for the variational formulation of the field equation in the next section .",
    "the guiding principle introduced above constrains the nature of variational principle , from which one can obtain the gravitational field equations .",
    "we get two key constraints :    first , this principle rules out the possibility of varying the metric tensor @xmath79 in any covariant , local action principle to obtain the field equations ! it is easy to prove @xcite that if : ( i ) the action is obtained by integrating a local , covariant lagrangian , with the covariant measure @xmath97 and ( ii ) the field equations are obtained by varying the metric in an unrestricted manner fixed ; we lack a sound physical motivation for this approach . ] in the action , then the field equations _ can not _ remain invariant under @xmath94 ( constant ) @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , the shift @xmath93 constant is no longer a symmetry transformation of the action if the metric is treated as the dynamical variable .",
    "so , any variational principle we come up with , can not have @xmath79 as the dynamical variable .",
    "you can not work with the hilbert action added to the matter action and vary @xmath79 to get .",
    "in fact , since violates our guiding principle , you do nt want to get at all .",
    "instead , we are looking for a variational principle which will give us .",
    "the second constraint , on any such variational principle leading to , is the following : since you can not introduce @xmath73 by varying @xmath79 in a matter action , the @xmath73 must be present in the functional we vary in some form which does not violate our guiding principle .",
    "the most natural structure , built from @xmath60 , which maintains the invariance we have demanded , viz . under @xmath94 ( constant ) @xmath95 , is given by @xmath98 where @xmath64 is a null vector .-",
    "dimensional spacetime , a null vector with @xmath99 degrees of freedom is the minimum one needs . for comparison ,",
    "suppose you introduce , say , a combination @xmath100 with a symmetric traceless tensor @xmath101 , in order to maintain the invariance under @xmath94 ( constant ) @xmath95 .",
    "then you will introduce @xmath102 extra degrees of freedom ; in @xmath103 , this introduces nine degrees of freedom , which is like introducing three null vectors rather than one .",
    "] this is exactly the combination that appears in the right hand side of .",
    "the fact that you can not vary the metric to get the equations of motion can come as a bit of a shock , if you had a traditional upbringing .",
    "this can indeed lead to trouble if you want to obtain but as i said before , our guiding principle selected out as the correct one . in this equation",
    "we have the auxiliary variable @xmath46 and one can indeed construct variational principles in which we vary @xmath46 and obtain and thus . so everything is completely consistent within the spirit of the formalism we are developing .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let me show you a simple variational principle which satisfies the above criterion and leads to .",
    "since you can not vary the metric , let us consider an action principle @xcite in which we vary a null vector field @xmath46 .",
    "we take the action principle to be : @xmath104= \\int \\frac{d^4x}{l_p^4 } \\sqrt{-g}\\ , \\left ( l_p^4 t_{ab } \\ell^a \\ell^b + p^{ab}_{cd } \\nabla_a \\ell^c\\ , \\nabla_b \\ell^d\\right ) \\label{tpa}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is a tensor with the algebraic symmetries of the curvature tensor and is divergence - free in all the indices .",
    "we take it to be @xmath106 it is straightforward to show that varying @xmath46 after introducing a lagrange multiplier to ensure @xmath107 will lead to the equation @xmath108 which  in turn  leads to ; see footnote 3 .",
    "so , the action in  which seems to describe a garden variety null vector field with quadratic coupling  actually leads to the result you want in an extremum principle , you get an evolution equation for @xmath109 . here",
    "we vary @xmath110 in but get an equation constraining the background metric @xmath79 !",
    "this comes about because , after varying @xmath110 , we demand that the equation must hold for all @xmath110 . while this makes our extremum principle conceptually different from the usual ones ,",
    "it is perfectly well - defined  and will make physical sense very soon . ]",
    "as long as the kinetic energy term has a peculiar structure !    this algebraic fact can be demystified by noticing that the kinetic energy term in can be reduced to the form @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "so , except for a total divergence which does not contribute to the variation , we are actually working with an action that is proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "the action does not contain any kinetic energy term for @xmath46 at all once you remove the total divergence !",
    "nevertheless , is a perfectly legitimate action in which you can vary @xmath46 and get the equations we want . in the matter action",
    "; i.e. , @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the matter variables . this works with the following extra prescription : you vary @xmath64 _ first _ to get the field equations for gravity , use the on - shell values in the first term @xmath116 in @xmath117 and extremize the resulting functional with respect to the matter variables @xmath115 to determine the matter equations of motion . in a path integral you integrate over @xmath64 first .",
    "the reason why you need to vary @xmath64 first will become clearer later on , when we identify @xmath64 with internal variables describing the spacetime microstructure . ]",
    "since this is a somewhat peculiar situation , i will describe what is going on in a slightly more general context .",
    "define @xmath118 \\equiv \\left(t^a_b ( x ) - \\frac{1}{\\kappa } r^a_b ( x)\\right ) \\ell_a\\ell^b",
    "\\equiv e^a_b \\ell_a\\ell^b \\label{tpone}\\ ] ] which is a function of @xmath16 through @xmath60 and @xmath119 and a quadratic _ functional _ of the null vector field @xmath120 .",
    "consider now a variational principle based on the expression @xmath121 = \\int dv f(q[x;\\ell_a ] ) \\label{tptwo}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is a function of @xmath123  which is , at present , arbitrary  and @xmath124 is treated as a functional of @xmath46 .",

    "( most of the time , in our later discussion , we will be concerned with an integration over a null surface . )",
    "consider a variational principle of the form @xmath127 subject to the constraint that @xmath128 .",
    "incorporating this constraint by a lagrange multiplier @xmath129 amounts to changing @xmath130 . varying @xmath131 and demanding that @xmath132 for arbitrary @xmath133 leads to the condition @xmath134",

    "for this to work : ( i ) the expression within the square bracket in should vanish and ( ii ) @xmath123 , which appears in @xmath135 , should become independent of @xmath46 on - shell .",
    "the second condition , in turn , requires @xmath136 for some @xmath137 , so that @xmath138 on - shell . substituting @xmath139 into the square bracket in fixes",
    "the lagrange multiplier function @xmath129 to be @xmath140 but is otherwise of no consequence .",
    "should be finite and non - zero .",
    "this does not put any severe condition on the nature of the function @xmath122 .",
    "in fact , we will see later that the choice important to us is just @xmath141 . ] taking the divergence of @xmath139 and using the bianchi identity as well as @xmath51 determines @xmath137 to be @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a constant . plugging it back into , we get the field equation to be @xmath144 which , of course , is the same as .",

    "the classical field equations arise from this expression when : ( 1 ) we evaluate it in the saddle point approximation and ( 2 ) demand that the result should hold for all @xmath46 .",

    "varying @xmath79 in @xmath150 will now lead to a nonlocal field equation relating @xmath79 to @xmath73 .",

    "given a classical action principle @xmath204 based on some dynamical variables @xmath205  which are varied to get the classical equations of motion  one could hope to construct a quantum version of the theory using the amplitude @xmath203 .",

    "one takes the classical equations to be and the metric to be the dynamical variable which is varied in , say , the hilbert action .",
    "one is then led to models of quantum gravity in which the spacetime metric ( or its variants ) become quantum dynamical variables .",
    "but as i have argued , the correct form of the classical field equation is not but .",
    "you can not get this equation by varying the metric in an action principle ; in fact , the guiding principle tells you that you can not treat the metric as a dynamical variable at all in a local action .",
    "so the variational principle we are looking at is of a different kind .",
    "such a different kind of extremum principle also arises in physics but in the context of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics . here",
    "the relevant dynamical equations are obtained by extremising the entropy @xmath206 or the associated number of degrees of freedom @xmath207 related to @xmath206 by @xmath208 .",
    "this thermodynamic interpretation of @xmath153 tells us that the variational principle one should look for in gravity is of the second kind .",
    "i will now show how a more complete picture emerges when we add the gravity sector to the matter sector .",
    "so far i have treated @xmath120 as an external null vector field in the spacetime and hence a function of the coordinate @xmath16 . while this approach proves the existence of suitable variational principles  which obey our criteria and lead to",
    " this is not a fundamentally new perspective on gravity .",
    "there is , however , a reinterpretation of the variational principle based on @xmath122 and @xmath153 which will lead us to the objective outlined in sec . 1 , viz . , to introduction of the phase space for the atoms of spacetime .",
    "let me describe this procedure .",
    "the variational principle in , based on @xmath122 , does not contain derivatives of @xmath64 and hence is locally algebraic .",
    "so it works even if we do not perform the integration over @xmath126 in .",
    "let us therefore consider @xmath209 and @xmath210 as _ functions _ of two independent variables @xmath16 and @xmath211 and think of @xmath211 as a set of internal parameters describing the atoms of spacetime at @xmath16 .",

    "we shall see that treating @xmath16 and @xmath211 as independent variables provides deeper insights .",
    "let us next apply this interpretation to the heat density of matter and treat @xmath217 as a function of two phase space variables @xmath218 .",
    "this will allow us to re - express our results in a different form , in terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "recall that the entropy @xmath219 associated with the heat @xmath186 in is given by @xmath220 where @xmath221 is a temperature introduced essentially for dimensional purposes .",

    "this connects up with the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : grfratoms ] and , in particular , with the result quoted in the first equation in .",
    "there are , however , two points to be noted with this identification . first , recall that @xmath219 in was defined for a fiducial null surface with the normal @xmath46 , which is a function of coordinates ( that is , @xmath229 ) and depends on the null surface . even at this stage , we could consider _ different _ null surfaces passing through a given event @xmath16 , each leading to a different null vector @xmath64 at that event .",
    "we have formalized this independence of @xmath16 and @xmath64 in defining @xmath230 by treating @xmath16 and @xmath46 as two independent vectors .",
    "this is consistent with the manner in which @xmath35 and @xmath231 were introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : grfratoms ] . at this stage , we are only concerned with the algebraic form of @xmath35 and its relation to @xmath73 .",
    "later on , i will describe how @xmath46 actually arises as a variable describing the  at an event .",
    "the second point has to do with the observer dependence of entropy as well as the degrees of freedom which contribute to the entropy .",
    "there is a folklore belief that the degrees of freedom have some kind of absolute reality and are observer independent .",
    "this is , of course , not true when we take into account the thermodynamics of horizons .",
    "the temperature and the entropy associated with the local rindler horizon ( or , for that matter , the black hole horizon ) is totally observer dependent . since @xmath232",
    ", we reach the conclusion that the degrees of freedom involved in the definition of horizon entropy are also observer dependent .",
    "this curious feature arises mathematically from the following facts @xcite : in general , one can eliminate the gauge degrees of freedom of spacetime through the diffeomorphisms @xmath57 .",
    "but an observer who perceives a null surface as a horizon can only invoke a subset of all diffeomorphisms viz .",
    ", those which preserve the null surface as a horizon .",
    "this means that such an observer can eliminate only a subset of all the degrees of freedom using the diffeomorphisms available to her .",
    "this makes certain gauge degrees of freedom appear as physical degrees of freedom@xcite for such an observer thereby leading to non - zero entropy .",
    "this fact is not directly relevant to our discussion but i mention it only because of the prevalent misconception that the degrees of freedom are observer independent .",
    "based on the ideas described above , i will now look for an extremum principle which maximizes the total number of degrees of freedom of geometry plus matter .",
    "this will involve extremising an expression of the kind @xmath233 where @xmath234 is defined in above and @xmath235 is the microscopic degrees of freedom of spacetime geometry , which is the number of atoms of space over @xmath236 gives the number density of particles at @xmath16 .",
    "one can also integrate @xmath237 over all space and get the number density of particles with momentum @xmath238 .",

    " as i stressed earlier  we could also think of @xmath46 as an additional vector independent of @xmath16 in the expression for @xmath35 .",
    "with such an interpretation , @xmath239 becomes completely analogous to a distribution function with @xmath16 and @xmath59 denoting independent phase space variables .",
    "we shall adopt this interpretation in what follows since it offers a better insight into the .",
    "exponentiating this expression with respect to the product over @xmath30 and converting the sum using the measure introduced earlier in going from to , we find that @xmath240 the maximization of this expression should give us the classical field equation at length scales much larger than @xmath8 .",
    "this , in turn , requires us to determine the number density of the atoms of space , @xmath239 at any given event .",
    "i will show in the next section how one could determine @xmath239 from microscopic considerations leading to the expression @xmath241 which is correct to the lowest order we are interested in and is adequate to obtain the classical field equation . substituting into",

    "thus , we have obtained classical gravity from a thermodynamic variational principle maximizing the number of degrees of freedom @xmath22 of matter plus gravity .",
    "i will now describe how we can obtain the expression for @xmath36 used in .",
    "it is natural to assume that the number of atoms of space , @xmath36 , ( _ i.e. _ , the ) at an event @xmath164 should be proportional to either the area or volume ( which are the two most primitive geometrical constructs ) that we can `` associate with '' the event @xmath164 .",
    "what we need to do is to give a precise meaning to the phrase , `` area or volume associated with '' the event @xmath164 .    for this task ,",
    "i will first introduce the notion of an equi - geodesic surface , which can be done either in the euclidean sector or in the lorentzian sector ; i will work in the euclidean sector .",

    "this describes a standard result in differential geometry and is often presented as a measure of the curvature at any event .",

    "\\(iii ) the approach brings to the center - stage the geodesic interval @xmath261 ( rather than the metric ) as the proper variable to describe spacetime geometry @xcite . in a classical spacetime ,",
    "both @xmath261 and @xmath328 contain the same amount of information and each is derivable from the other .",
    "but the geodesic interval @xmath261 seems to be better suited to take into account quantum gravitational effects to a certain extent .",
    "\\(iv ) the spacetime geometry and matter couple to @xmath64 through the terms @xmath329 and @xmath161 respectively , thereby leading to an effective coupling between them . the physical nature ( and origin ) of these two couplings are quite distinct .",
    "the @xmath161 came from the behaviour of matter crossing the local rindler horizon and the @xmath64 in this expression originally represented the normal to the local rindler horizon .",
    "the @xmath329 term , however , arose from the limit of the area measure @xmath259 in a spacetime endowed with a zero - point length .",
    "the @xmath304 gets mapped to the normal @xmath64 to the null surface through a limiting process when we take the limit @xmath254 in the euclidean sector .",
    "this mapping , in turn , depends on the fact that the condition @xmath330 will lead to @xmath331 in the euclidean space while it will be satisfied by all events connected by a null ray in the lorentzian space .",
    "\\(v ) finally , for the sake of completeness , i mention how this formalism can , in principle , be used to obtain semi - classical corrections to the gravitational field equations .",
    "one way to do this is to re - write @xmath22 in , converting both the products into sums with @xmath332 and @xmath333 where @xmath334 in the euclidean sector and @xmath335 in the lorentzian sector . ] thereby obtaining @xmath336 here @xmath337 denotes different geometrical variables like the metric , curvature tensor etc . performing the summation over @xmath304 , this reduces to the expression @xmath338 where we have defined @xmath339   \\label{rt9}\\ ] ] extremising @xmath340 with respect to the metric will provide an equation relating the geometrical variables to the energy momentum tensor and will contain corrections to the classical field equation .",
    "moreover , the result will maintain invariance under @xmath341 since the original expression for @xmath22 has this invariance built into it .",
    "this result , however , is just formal at this stage because of three reasons : ( i ) the sum in when converted as an integral over @xmath342 diverges even at the lowest order ( where the expression in the square bracket is quadratic in @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is to be expected since a formalism analogous to kinetic theory must break down at small scales and one needs to cut off the integration range of the momentum variable @xmath33 .",
    "it is not clear at this stage how to do this correctly .",
    "( ii ) we need an exact expression for @xmath343 and it is possible to come up with several ansatz for it .",
    "( one possibility is to use the result that @xmath344 but there are many geometrical objects which goes over to @xmath36 at the leading order . )",
    "even if we come up with a physical criterion , the algebraic expression will be quite complicated and will involve all the spatial derivatives of the curvature tensor",
    ". it will be difficult to perform the sum in even with a cut - off and then obtain the corrections to classical equations .",
    "( iii ) conceptually , i am not happy with varying the metric to get the field equations even from an emergent , effective , action which respects the invariance under @xmath345 , though it is far better than using the metric as a fundamental dynamical variable .",
    "the guiding principle i introduced right at the beginning tells you that gravity does not directly couple to the . in the field equations",
    "arises as an integration constant and  being a global constant  needs to be fixed just once .",
    "we need an extra physical principle for fixing the value of  and we expect it to arise from the theoretical formalism itself . indeed it does .",
    "i mentioned earlier that our approach assigns , at the leading order , a single microscopic degree of freedom to each spacetime event on - shell .",
    "this means that the quantum gravitational unit of information , associated with a 2-sphere of radius @xmath8 can be taken to be @xmath346 .",
    "i will now show how this @xmath327 arises in the study of our universe and helps us to determine the value of the cosmological constant , in a rather intriguing manner @xcite .",
    "let me give you the bottom line first , just to show how intriguing it is .",
    "observations suggest that the evolution of our universe can be described by three different phases , viz .",
    ", an inflationary phase very early on , followed by a radiation / matter dominated phase which lasted until recently , and an accelerated phase dominated by a small cosmological constant which has started in the near - past and will continue forever .",
    "these three phases are characterized by three densities @xmath347 ( which is the density of matter at the epoch when matter and radiation densities were equal ) and @xmath348 .",
    "these three densities make up the signature of our universe , in the sense that the entire evolutionary history can be determined in terms of these numbers .",
    "observations determine @xmath349 and @xmath348 fairly accurately as : @xmath350 ^ 4 $ ] and @xmath351 ^ 4 $ ] ; we do not have a direct handle on @xmath352 but it is usually taken to be about @xmath353 .",
    "so , in standard cosmology , these three densities have no relation with each other and they are widely different .",
    "i now invite you to form a strange dimensionless number @xmath354 out of these three densities by the definition : @xmath355 and evaluate its numerical value by plugging in the known values for the three densities .",
    "surprisingly enough , you will find that @xmath356 that is , @xmath357 to an accuracy of one part in thousand for the standard values used in the current cosmological models .",
    "this should make you wonder why the right hand side of has such a pleasing value as @xmath327 since it is not often that such strange things happen . in what follows",
    ", i will show that : ( i ) the right hand side of can actually be interpreted , in a well - defined manner , as the amount of of cosmic information accessible to an eternal observer and ( ii ) the reason it is @xmath327 has to do with the quantum microstructure of spacetime .",
    "defined via has a numerical value @xmath327 for our universe .",
    "you need to be a true believer in coincidences if you think such a result does not tell us anything about our universe and can be completely ignored as `` just one of those things '' ! ] obviously , turning this principle around and taking @xmath358 , one can determine the numerical value of  in terms of the other cosmological parameters , @xmath359 and @xmath352 which  eventually  will be determined from the high energy physics .",
    "a key feature of gravity is its ability to control the amount of information accessible to any given observer . over decades",
    ", we have come to realize@xcite that information is a physical entity and that anything which affects the flow and accessibility of information will have direct physical consequences .",
    "a well - known example of this idea arises in the physics of black holes .",
    "it turns out that a similar idea , applied to the cosmos , allows us to solve  what is usually considered to be  _ the _ deepest mystery about our universe , viz . , the small numerical value ( @xmath360 ) of the , @xmath49 .",
    "let me begin by recalling how the existence of a non - zero  prevents an eternal observer @xmath361 ( i.e. , an observer whose world line extends to @xmath362 and who makes observations at very late times ) from acquiring information from the far reaches of our universe .",
    "let @xmath363 be the comoving distance traveled by a light signal between the epochs @xmath364 and @xmath365 with @xmath366 in the standard frw model with expansion factor @xmath367 .",
    "this is given by : @xmath368 therefore the comoving [ @xmath369 and proper [ @xmath370 sizes of the regions of the universe at an epoch @xmath165 , from which @xmath361 can receive signals at very late times , are given by @xcite : @xmath371 the nature of @xmath372 and @xmath373 depends crucially on whether the  is zero or non - zero . if @xmath374 and the universe is dominated by normal matter at late times , then @xmath375 , with @xmath376 at late times .",
    "then , both these integrals diverge at the _ upper _ limit as @xmath362 , irrespective of the behaviour of the universe at earlier epochs .",
    "so , in a universe with @xmath374 , the infinite expanse of space will be visible to the eternal observer at late times ; there is no blocking of information .    if @xmath377 and @xmath378 constant at late times , then the situation is quite different . in that case , both the integrals in are finite at the upper limit and an eternal observer can only access information from a _ finite _ region of space at an epoch @xmath165 , irrespective of how long she waits .",
    "the amount of accessible cosmic information ( `` cosmin '' ) is now reduced from an infinite amount to a finite value , say @xmath379 , as a _",
    "direct consequence _ of the fact that @xmath377 .",
    "_ it is , therefore , reasonable to expect that the actual numerical value of @xmath49 should be related to @xmath379 with @xmath379 decreasing with increasing @xmath49 .",
    "_ i will now derive this relationship .",
    "let us consider a universe ( like ours ) with three distinct phases of evolution : ( i ) at very early times , the universe is in a state of inflation with @xmath380 constant .",
    "( ii ) at @xmath381 , the inflation ends ; the universe reheats and becomes radiation - dominated .",
    "this goes on till @xmath382 which is the epoch of radiation - matter equality . during @xmath383 ,",
    "the universe is matter - dominated .",
    "( iii ) for @xmath384 , the  drives the expansion of the universe .",
    "i will rescale the expansion factor such that @xmath385 , and also define the three densities @xmath386 and @xmath352 in terms of the corresponding hubble parameters through the standard relations @xmath387 , etc .",

    "i will assume instant reheating at @xmath390 for simplicity .",
    "the dynamics of our universe is completely determined by three densities @xmath386 and @xmath352 which are introduced as purely empirical parameters . amongst them",
    ", we have some hope that the high energy physics will eventually determine @xmath349 and @xmath352 in terms of a viable inflationary model and the dark matter content .",
    "but we have no theoretical framework which could fix the value of @xmath348 or relate it to the other two densities .",

    "the geometrical features related to @xmath372 and other relevant length scales are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthscales ] .",
    "the green curve denotes the _ comoving _ hubble radius @xmath394 .",

    "as i said , the region of space from which an eternal observer can acquire information is finite for all finite @xmath165 if  is non - zero .",
    "our next task is to quantify the amount of cosmic information that is accessible to the eternal observer . to do this ,",
    "recall that a comoving scale @xmath408 constant corresponds to a proper length scale @xmath409 .",
    "the proper length scales ( e.g. , those corresponding to wavelengths of modes ) will get stretched exponentially during the inflation , and will exit the hubble radius .",
    "they will remain outside the hubble radius but some of them will re - enter the hubble radius during the matter / radiation dominated epoch .",
    "( two such modes are marked as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthscales ] . ) in contrast , the mode marked as ( 3 ) will exit the hubble radius but will _ never _ re - enter it .",
    "such modes actually cross not only the hubble radius but also the horizon ( red line ) and become invisible to the eternal observer at , say , the epoch of reheating @xmath404 .",
    "so the modes which are relevant to cosmology are confined to those between the two dotted horizontal lines which are tangential to the hubble radius at its turning points . the modes in this blue band contain all the relevant information about our universe and the total number of such modes give us a proper measure of the information content @xmath379 .",
    "i will now estimate how many such modes cross the hubble radius during the inflationary phase between @xmath410 and @xmath404 . since the desitter space is invariant under time translation , the _ rate _ at which the modes exit the hubble radius will be a constant .",
    "so the number of modes @xmath411 which cross the hubble radius during any interval @xmath412 must be proportional to @xmath413",
    ". the total number of modes which cross the hubble radius during the inflationary epoch will be proportional to @xmath414 , where @xmath415 is the relevant duration in the inflationary phase . here",
    "@xmath416 is just the number of e - foldings in the interval @xmath417 .",
    "therefore , the cosmin is given by : @xmath418 and all we need is the proportionality constant .",
    "this can be determined as follows : the number of modes @xmath419 in the comoving hubble volume @xmath420 with wave numbers in the range @xmath421 is given by @xmath422 where @xmath423 .",

    "so the modes with wave numbers in the range ( @xmath426 ) , where @xmath427\\ , da$ ] , will exit the hubble radius in an interval ( @xmath428 ) .",
    "hence , the number of modes that cross the hubble radius during the interval @xmath412 is given by @xmath429}{da } \\ , da = \\frac{2}{3\\pi}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{a_2 h_2}{a_1h_1}\\right)\\ ] ] ( incidentally , this result is applicable for any @xmath367 . ) during inflation , when @xmath430 , this expression reduces to @xmath431 showing that the proportionality constant in is @xmath432 .",
    "thus the value of cosmin is given by @xmath433 from the geometry , we can relate the ratio @xmath434 to the three densities @xmath435 and @xmath436 which will give @xmath437 . to determine the proportionality constant , we need to evaluate the turning point of the @xmath438 curve near @xmath439 which , in turn , requires solving a cubic equation .",
    "doing this @xcite , we find that the proportionality constant has the value @xmath440 .",
    "substituting in to , we can achieve our first goal , viz .",

    "[ fig : lengthscales ] , the black line indicates the _ comoving _ length scale @xmath443 corresponding to the planck length .",

    "the modes which contain the cosmic information cross the comoving planck length during the earlier stages of evolution and hence will carry the imprint of quantum gravitational effects .",
    "so @xmath379 has to be determined by quantum gravitational considerations .    from our previous discussion , we know that the unit @xmath444 of quantum gravitational information content of spacetime is given by the degrees of freedom contained in a 2-sphere of radius @xmath8 , viz . ,",

    "i will conclude with a few comments :    \\(1 ) the relation @xmath453 , also allows us to determine the relevant number of @xmath454-foldings in the inflationary epoch which carries the cosmic information .",

    "i stress that this is probably the _ only _ model with quantum gravitational inputs _ which leads to a falsifiable prediction_.",
    "there is sufficient amount of evidence to indicate that the correct model for the quantum structure of spacetime will have the following ingredients in one form or the other .",

    "\\(a ) the field equations of classical gravity should emerge as the thermodynamic limit of an underlying statistical mechanics for the .",
    "this implies that the field equations should come from maximizing a suitably defined density of states . *",
    "\\(b ) the thermodynamics of null surfaces , as well as the observer dependent entropy , which arises from the local loss of information ( when a null surface acts as a one - way membrane to a class of observers ) should play a key role in determining the classical limit . *",

    "\\(e ) a primary effect of quantum gravity should be to modify the classical geodesic interval @xmath261 to a function @xmath265 such that @xmath462 behaves as the zero point length of the spacetime .",
    "the conventional approaches to quantum gravity ignores ( b ) and ( c ) completely , have no clue as to how to handle the  problem ( viz .",
    "they do lead to ( e ) in some vague sense but do not use the discreteness of spacetime to compute the density of states and develop ( a ) ; the conventional emphasis is on action principles rather than on thermodynamic variational principles .    in this article ,",
    "i have outlined the procedure which implements all these principles .",
