    "for a wide class of compound semiconductor materials ac and bc , alloys of the type a@xmath0b@xmath1c can be realized .",
    "these substitutional alloys find a large variety of applications , in particular in nanoelectronic structures like quantum wells , quantum wires and quantum dots .",
    "since the bulk band gap varies continuously with @xmath2 , a tayloring of the energy gap is possible by variation of the concentration .",
    "most of the ii - vi and iii - v compound semiconductors , e.g.cdse , znse , cds , cdte , gaas or inas possess a direct band gap , covering the entire visible spectrum , which makes them particularly suitable in optoelectronic and especially photonic devices .",
    "many of these materials show a pronounced bowing behaviour of the bulk band gap as a function of the concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the deviation from linear behaviour can often be described using a single bowing parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the concentration dependent energy gap @xmath5 of the mixed crystal is then given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the corresponding gaps of the pure ac and bc material .",
    "when the pure materials ac and bc have considerably different lattice constants , also a non - parabolic dependence of the band gap on @xmath2 is observed .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , a fit of experimental band gap data by the ansatz ( [ eq : bandgapbowing ] ) is still common and adequately possible for materials like cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se , al@xmath0ga@xmath1as , in@xmath0ga@xmath1as and many more .",
    "the corresponding literature values for the parameter @xmath4 usually show a large variety , depending on the theoretical or experimental approach used . in the present paper",
    "we will concentrate on bulk cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se , where a broad range of values between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ev is reported .",
    "@xcite from the experimental point of view , this discrepancy considerably originates from the fact that the stable phase of pure cdse is the wurtzite phase , while pure znse will crystallize in the cubic zincblende modification .",
    "also , the experimental realization has to deal with phase separation effects and the miscibility gap of the alloys .",
    "this makes it difficult to grow homogeneously alloyed cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se bulk samples over the whole concentration range .",
    "these problems carry over directly to the theoretical side , as the experimental determination of material properties and hence input parameters for calculations involving zincblende cdse is very difficult and will often depend on the substrate on which the sample was grown .    in the past , a broad spectrum of different computational methods has been applied to calculate the band gaps of alloyed ii - vi and iii - v bulk systems , from highly - sophisticated methods like empirical pseudopotential @xcite or dft + lda @xcite models , over empirical tight - binding models ( etbm ) @xcite to simple two band models@xcite . within the etbm ,",
    "one common approach is to use a plane - wave basis set and implicitly map the alloyed and therefore disordered systems onto an effective translationally invariant system by either using a simple linear interpolation of relevant parameters ( virtual crystal approximation , vca ) or more sophisticated green function methods ( coherent potential approximation , cpa ) . because the vca is known to vastly underestimate the band gap bowing in most cases ,  @xcite and the standard cpa approaches also fail to give quantitatively accurate results ,  @xcite tight - binding ( tb ) methods that use a localized basis set on a finite supercell@xcite are more promising nowadays .",
    "these models , albeit computationally costful , are able to reproduce bowing effects and are exact in the disorder .    to calculate the electronic properties of such semiconductor alloys , we start from multiband @xmath3 tight - binding models for the pure bulk semiconductor materials ac and bc and then perform calculations on a finite ensemble of supercells .",
    "we will make recommendations for the cell size as well as for the necessary number of realizations , based on the convergence of the bowing parameter .",
    "these recommendations will then be verified by comparison to band gaps as determined from photoluminescence data for catalytically grown cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se nanowires by venugopal _",
    "et al_.  @xcite we also present new experimental results obtained for cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se films grown by mbe , for which the band gap is determined by an analysis of absorption data . a good agreement between these experimental results and the theoretical results of the tb supercell approach",
    "is obtained .",
    "linear combinations of atomic orbitals can be used as ansatz for the wannier functions that are localized within the unit cell of the bravais lattice . from these wannier functions ,",
    "the itinerant bloch functions can be determined by a unitary transformation . because neither the atomic states nor the wannier functions are explicitly used in an etbm",
    ", one can directly assume a basis of wannier - like functions , which is the basic idea of the so - called effective bond - orbital model ( ebom ) .",
    "this resolution on the scale of unit cells is especially convenient for the case of binary semiconductor compounds of the type a@xmath0b@xmath1c , as each unit cell can either be occupied by the ac- or bc - material , respectively .    in order to adequately reproduce one @xmath12-like conduction band ( cb ) and three @xmath13-like valence bands , the heavy hole ( hh ) , light hole ( lh ) and",
    "split - off ( so ) band , we use a localized @xmath3 basis per spin direction : @xmath14 here @xmath15 labels the @xmath16 sites of the fcc lattice , which is the underlying bravais lattice of the zincblende crystal structure .",
    "the tb matrix elements of the bulk hamiltonian @xmath17 are then given by @xmath18 when restricting the non - vanishing matrix elements , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebomme ] ) , up to second nearest neighbors , a one - to - one correspondence between the tb matrix elements and a set of material parameters can be determined . in the present work ,",
    "we use the parametrization scheme of loehr ,  @xcite which fits the bulk band structure to a set of material parameters , namely the bulk band gap @xmath19 , the conduction band effective mass @xmath20 , the spin - orbit splitting @xmath21 , the conventional lattice constant @xmath22 and additionally to the x - point energies of the conduction band @xmath23 , the hh and lh bands @xmath24 ( which are degenerate at the brillouin zone boundary ) , and the so band @xmath25 .",
    "we use a set of material parameters from refs .",
    ", augmented by @xmath26-point energies from ref .. this hamiltonian has already been used succesfully for bulk as well as nanostructure calculations for several material systems .",
    "for detailed comparisons with other well - established models , we refer to refs . .",
    "our specific choice of values for the material parameters for cdse and znse has been proven to be reliable in calculations for pure quantum dots @xcite as well as for mixed cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se colloidal nanocrystals .",
    "@xcite      the usual approach for translationally invariant systems like pure bulk crystals is the construction of a plane - wave basis set from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp3basis ] ) , which then fulfills the bloch condition . for the cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se alloy system",
    ", we will now assume uncorrelated substitutional disorder and hence lose the translational symmetry .",
    "in analogy to calculations for zero - dimensional nanostructures ,  @xcite we will use a finite supercell with periodic boundary conditions , with the localized basis , eq.([eq : sp3basis ] ) , on each lattice site .",
    "each primitive cell will either be occupied by the diatomic cdse or znse basis , where the probability for the respective species is directly given by the concentrations @xmath2 and @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , we will use the matrix elements , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebomme ] ) of the pure cdse or znse material for the corresponding lattice sites and use a linear interpolation for hopping matrix elements between unit cells of different material . due to",
    "the resolution on the bravais lattice , all influences which stem from effects on a smaller length scale , like the difference in the cd  se and zn  se bond lengths , are absorbed into the values of the corresponding tb matrix elements between the  effective  orbitals .",
    "furthermore , we incorporate an appropriate valence band offset ( vbo ) between the two materials by shifting the respective site - diagonal matrix elements by the value @xmath28 ev , as established in ref .. although this treatment of the intersite hopping and the vbo has merely been well - proven for interfaces in quantum dot systems ,  @xcite our results for the bowing have turned out to be insensitive not only to the choice of the interface treatment but also to the specific value of @xmath29 ( not shown ) .",
    "the numerical diagonalization of the corresponding hamiltonian for each concentration and microscopic configuration gives the density of states ( dos ) of the finite ensemble , from which the band gap for each concentration can be determined as the difference between the overall lowest conduction band and highest valence band energy .",
    "fig.[fig : sizedep ] shows the corresponding band gap over the concentration in dependence on the number of lattice sites ( for fixed number of realizations ) , where each lattice site corresponds to one unit cell and thus two atoms .",
    "obviously , too small supercells produce an artificially high band gap bowing even with periodic boundary conditions , and this finite size effect can not be compensated for by a higher number of realizations ( not shown here ) .",
    "this could be attributed to clustering effects , as a local accumulation of the small band gap material will lead to an overall smaller band gap from the dos .",
    "our studies reveal that statistically relevant convergence for the bowing @xmath4 is safely reached with 4000 lattice sites ( 8000 atoms ) and @xmath30 realizations when seeking for a resolution of 10 mev , which corresponds to the last digit of the input energies . with a cubiform supercell , which does not artificially confine the degrees of freedom of the microscopic disorder , this corresponds to an edge length of @xmath31 . of course",
    ", these large supercells and high number of configurations require large computational costs .    from our results , we cautiously conclude that etbm calculations which use a lesser number of atoms on rectangular supercells ( like ref .  , where an approximate band structure is reconstructed with a @xmath32 supercell , i.e.1280 atoms ) could therefore overestimate the bowing of the alloy band gap .",
    "we performed first test calculations for other material systems ( e.g. ga@xmath11al@xmath1n ) as well and the convergence criterion of 4000 sites and 50 realizations remained still valid .",
    "finally , we want to dicuss the distributions of the band gap values from the different configurations . in theory",
    ", the difference between the lowest overall conduction band energy and the highest overall valence band energy corresponds to the band gap @xmath5 of the mixed a@xmath11b@xmath1c crystal , as approximated by the finite ensemble .",
    "this is also the usual way to determine band gaps in the cpa ,  @xcite which can reproduce broadening effects due to disorder .",
    "when referring to the energetic positions obtained from pl peak positions ( other effects like the stokes shift left aside for the moment ) , one should in principle compare to the ensemble - average @xmath33 of the band gap , because the effects of configurational and concentrational disorder , amongst others , are already absorbed into the finite emission linewidth .",
    "@xmath34 is here the difference between the lowest conduction band state and the highest valence band state for the @xmath35 microscopic configuration .    in fig.[fig :",
    "distr ] , we have depicted the relative frequency of the deviation of @xmath36 from the average value @xmath37 for cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se .",
    "as discussed above , we used 50 distinct microscopic configurations and the supercell was chosen to contain 4000 sites in order to reach convergence .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath36 is quite narrow for most concentrations @xmath38 and , of course , @xmath39-like for the pure system ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , where all microstates are identical .",
    "the biggest deviations , approximately 20 mev , between @xmath36 and @xmath37 occur for @xmath42 .",
    "further studies ( not shown ) reveal that only the conduction band edge is broadened due to the disorder , while the valence band edge is @xmath39-like over the whole concentration range within our finite resolution , which is in agreement with cpa calculations for other ii - vi alloys .",
    "@xcite the overall band gap of the finite ensemble is hence given by @xmath43 in the present work , we used @xmath44 for the comparison to pl data and the overall band gap of the ensemble dos @xmath19 for the absorption experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the distributions are so narrow that the bowing parameters calculated in this work only change within the error boundaries when switching between both approaches , provided that the above mentioned convergence criteria are fulfilled .",
    "venugopal _ et al . _",
    "performed photoluminescence ( pl ) and raman - scattering measurements on catalytically grown cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se nanowires ( 60 - 150 nm in diameter and several tens of micrometers in length ) in ref .. from these data , they determined the band gap as a function of the concentration @xmath2 and the corresponding bowing parameter .",
    "our tb parameter set was chosen so that their respective experimental band gaps at room temperature for the pure systems , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are reproduced in our calculations . as opposed to the films discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : thinfilms ] , the cd - richer nanowires still tend to crystallize in the wurtzite phase .",
    "regardless , the ebom results from the localized basis set , eq . ( [ eq : sp3basis ] ) , for the band gap will remain valid  @xcite when the only slightly larger energy gap of hexagonal cdse is used in the calculations , especially as the experimental data does not show any discontinuity .",
    "the resulting curve and the pl results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowires ] and show a very good agreement over the whole concentration range . a quadratic fit yields a bowing parameter of @xmath45 ev , which is in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath46 ev from ref .  .",
    "the samples have been prepared by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on a gaas ( 100 ) substrate at a temperature of 280@xmath47c .",
    "the binary znse and cdse layers have been grown directly on the substrate , while for the ternary alloys first a znse buffer layer of 20 nm thickness has been deposited , followed by the cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se layer . in order to realize different cd concentrations of the ternary compound , the operating temperature of the cd knudsen cell was varied from 226  -  240@xmath47c during deposition .",
    "special care was taken to ensure stoichiometric or slightly se - rich growth conditions for each case by adjusting the respective flux using both a se knudsen cell and a valved cracker source at the same time .",
    "a valved cracker source offers the advantage of rapid variations in elemental flux due to the availability of a motorized valve .",
    "the stoichiometry has been controlled in - situ employing a reflection high - energy electron - diffraction ( rheed ) system .",
    "a 2@xmath481 reconstruction indicates group vi - rich growth , while a c(2@xmath482 ) reconstruction can be assigned to metal - rich ( i.e.zn and cd ) conditions .",
    "stoichiometry is achieved when a superposition of both reconstructions can be identified within the rheed pattern .",
    "the growth rate of the cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se alloy depends sensitively on the ii / vi flux ratio .",
    "since the deposition time for cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se was kept constant ( 2 hours ) for the relevant samples , the thickness of the different cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se layers show a significant variation . however , this does not influence the accurate determination of the band gap as discussed below .",
    "the cd content and the respective strain state of the cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se layers has been determined by the evaluation of reciprocal space maps ( rsm ) in the vicinity of the ( 224 ) reflection recorded using high - resolution x - ray diffraction ( hrxrd ) .",
    "the rsm measured for the binary cdse sample ( @xmath41 ) is examplarily shown in fig.[fig : recspacemap ] .",
    "the peak of the cdse layer is located on a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph , indicating that the layer is fully relaxed and therefore unstrained .",
    "the same result is found for the other cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se films .",
    "merely the layer of the binary znse sample ( @xmath40 ) is not fully relaxed on the gaas substrate and therefore remains compressively strained .",
    "the absence of strain is especially important for the tb modelling for the system under consideration , as it does not have to include the effect of strain and piezoelectricity on the electronic states , as it is often the case in calculations for quantum dot systems .",
    "@xcite    in order to evaluate the optical constants , the band gap and the thickness of the cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se films , optical measurements were carried out using a j.a.woollam variable - angle spectroscopic ellipsometry ( vase ) setup .",
    "@xcite the spectra cover the wavelength range from 193 nm to 1700 nm ( 6.42 ev - 0.7 ev ) with wavelength steps of 2 nm . to get more accurate data , spectra for three different angles of incidence ( 65@xmath47 , 70@xmath47 and 75@xmath47 ) were registered and analyzed for each sample .",
    "all measurements were perfomed at room temperature . beside the gaas ( 100 )",
    "substrate , three layers were taken into account , namely the znse buffer , the cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se - layer and a thin additional layer to include the surface roughness into the model . the latter one was simulated by a bruggeman effective medium approximation ( ema ) using 50% voids in a matrix of the ii - vi semiconductor material .",
    "the optical constants were derived from the curve fits using a model which combines a herzinger - johs `` p - semi oscillator '' ( four connected functions to model each peak)@xcite with four gauss oscillators .",
    "the band gap @xmath19 of the cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se layers was obtained using the formula@xcite @xmath49 and the equation @xmath50 for the attenuation coefficient @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the extinction coefficent , @xmath53 the energy and @xmath54 the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "the spectral extinction coefficent @xmath52 is determined by the spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement of the samples and @xmath19 is obtained graphically by evaluating the intersection of the tangent of @xmath55 with the energy axis ( see fig.[fig : abs_edge ] ) .",
    "a comprehensive overview of the relevant experimental parameters for the samples is given in table  [ tab : table_samples ] .",
    ".selected parameters of the cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se films determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry and high - resolution x - ray diffraction .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when we have a closer look at the values for the bowing coefficient @xmath4 , we can conclude that , in spite of the different experimental conditions and therefore boundary values at @xmath41 and @xmath40 , all bowing values lie within the comparatively narrow range between @xmath56 ev and @xmath57 ev .",
    "this stands in contrast to several previous studies , who reported a broad variety of values between @xmath9 and @xmath58 ev ,  @xcite as already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "therefore , we recommend a critical review of literature values outside the range given in tab.[tab : table_summary ] before using them for further purposes .",
    "in this paper , we presented a combined theoretical and experimental approach for the determination of the band gap bowing of binary compound semiconductor alloys of the type a@xmath0b@xmath1c . on the theoretical side",
    ", we used a multiband empirical tight - binding approach with a localized basis set on the lattice sites of a finite supercell with periodic boundary conditions . by calculating the band gap for each concentration",
    "@xmath2 from the density of states of a finite ensemble with different microscopic configurations , our approach is exact in the alloy - induced disorder .",
    "the input parameters are a set of material properties of the pure ac or bc system , i.e. for the cases @xmath41 and @xmath40 . using the example of cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se",
    ", we gave recommandations on the minimal size of the supercell and the minimal necessary number of microscopic configurations in order to determine the band gap bowing coefficient @xmath4 with the same degree of accuracy as the input parameters , as fig.[fig : sizedep ] showed that the results depend strongly on these model parameters .",
    "furthermore , we compared our results for the band gap bowing of cd@xmath0zn@xmath1se with two slightly distinct experimental realizations . at first , we compared our results to photoluminescence data from catalytically grown cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se nanowires by venugopal _",
    "et al_. then we used our tb model for an analysis of absorption data from unstrained mbe - grown cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se films , and also gave a detailed description of the experimental realization of this data set .",
    "in both cases , our model fits the experimental data well . for the nanowires pl data ,",
    "even the experimental band gap bowing parameter can be reproduced within the error margin , while the measurements on the epitaxially grown films show a slightly higher deviation from the theoretical predictions .",
    "nevertheless , within the experimental accuracy the bulk band gaps from all but one mbe samples fit the theoretical curve well .",
    "dependent on the specific experimental conditions , we carefully approve to narrow down the range of the bowing parameter for bulk cd@xmath11zn@xmath1se at room temperature to between @xmath56 ev and @xmath57 ev .",
    "in contrast to common tight - binding models , which treat the disorder within a mean - field framework , like the virtual crystal approximation , our simple tb supercell approach is able to satisfactorily reproduce the experimental findings and can thus be used to coherently calculate bowing coefficients for other material systems and growth conditions , which in addition may not be experimentally accessible over the whole concentration range . for this purpose ,",
    "our model can easily be transferred to other material systems like cd@xmath0zn@xmath1s , al@xmath0ga@xmath1as , in@xmath0ga@xmath1as , ga@xmath0al@xmath1n , and many others in order to calculate the bowing of the band gap .",
    "also , materials with a wurtzite structure can be simulated , as only the corresponding tb hamiltonian in the effective bond - orbital model has to be replaced by the one given in ref .. first results indicate that our minimal criteria for the numerical convergence of the band gap bowing will still remain valid , although this will have to be tested carefully for each system under consideration , in combination with the respective experimental data obtained by means of epitaxy .",
