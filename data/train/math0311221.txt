    "by the definition given by j.  eells and j.h .",
    "sampson in @xcite , a map @xmath1 from a compact riemannian manifold @xmath2 to another riemannian manifold @xmath3 is harmonic if it is a critical point of the energy @xmath4 + from the first variation formula it follows that @xmath1 is harmonic if and only if its first tension field @xmath5 vanishes .",
    "the same authors suggested a generalization of the notion of harmonicity : a map @xmath1 is biharmonic if it is a critical point of the bienergy functional @xmath6 + the first variation formula for @xmath7 , given by g.y .",
    "jiang in @xcite and @xcite , is reobtained in @xcite and can be written as @xmath8 + where @xmath9 is a variation of @xmath1 , @xmath10 is the variational vector field along @xmath1 , and @xmath11 + here @xmath12 denotes the jacobi operator and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the connection in @xmath15 .",
    "hence the condition of biharmonicity for @xmath1 is @xmath16 + when @xmath17 is not compact , as a definition of biharmonicity one can adopt equation ( [ tensione2 ] ) instead of the definition given in terms of the integral formula of the bienergy .    since any harmonic map is evidently biharmonic , we are interested in non - harmonic biharmonic maps .    in general ,",
    "the biharmonic equation is very complicated , and therefore the problem of finding examples of non - harmonic biharmonic maps between two riemannian manifolds , or examples of non - harmonic ( non - minimal ) biharmonic submanifolds of a given riemannian manifold , is difficult to solve .",
    "still there are some results that now we mention .",
    "* biharmonic curves on a surface in @xmath18 have been considered in @xcite . * in @xcite the authors gave the complete classification of non - minimal biharmonic submanifolds of @xmath19 .",
    "these are certain circles , spherical helices and parallel spheres .",
    "the general case of @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , is more interesting and has been treated in @xcite . * more recently , in @xcite , it has been shown how to construct non - harmonic biharmonic maps from @xmath17 to @xmath22 by deforming conformally the metric of @xmath17 . * when @xmath17 is a submanifold of the euclidean space @xmath23 , the biharmonicity condition seems to be very restrictive .",
    "in fact , b.y .",
    "chen conjectured in @xcite that any biharmonic submanifold of the euclidean space @xmath23 is minimal .",
    "this was proved to be true in the case of submanifolds in @xmath18 ( in @xcite ) and in other special cases ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . *",
    "the same result was proved in @xcite for any @xmath24-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath25 with constant negative sectional curvature @xmath26 . * other results about non - existence of non - harmonic biharmonic maps ,",
    "when the sectional curvature or the ricci curvature of @xmath22 is non - positive , can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it seems then natural , as the next step , to consider biharmonic submanifolds in a @xmath24-manifold @xmath22 with non - constant sectional curvature .",
    "we choose as @xmath22 the heisenberg group @xmath0 .",
    "this nilpotent lie group is not - symmetric ; nevertheless it has many symmetries , in the sense that its isometry group has dimension four , the biggest possible for a 3-space of non - constant sectional curvature .",
    "it is probably in virtue of these symmetries that some main problem turns out to be easier than expected . as , for instance , the problem of finding the equations of geodesics ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and that of determining all surfaces with constant mean or gaussian curvature invariant with respect to some subgroup of the isometry group ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this manifold has many interesting properties .",
    "we mention , for example , that there are no totally umbilical surfaces and therefore there are no totally geodesic surfaces in @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we first write down the conditions that any non - harmonic ( non - geodesic ) biharmonic curve in @xmath0 must satisfy .",
    "then we prove that the non - geodesic biharmonic curves in @xmath0 are helices .",
    "a similar fact occurs in @xmath19 .",
    "finally we deduce the explicit parametric equations of the non - geodesic biharmonic curves in @xmath0 .    _ notation .",
    "_ we shall work in @xmath27 category , i.e. manifolds , metrics , connections , maps will be assumed to be smooth .",
    "the heisenberg group @xmath0 can be seen as the euclidean space @xmath18 endowed with the multiplication @xmath28 + and with the riemannian metric @xmath29 given by @xmath30 + the metric @xmath29 is invariant with respect to the left - translations corresponding to that multiplication .",
    "this metric is isometric to the other , also quite standard , which is left - invariant with respect to the composition arising from the multiplication of the @xmath31 heisenberg matrices .    at each point",
    "the metric @xmath29 has an axial symmetry : the 4-dimensional group of its isometries contains the group of rotations around the @xmath32 axis ( in the classical terminology ( see @xcite ) a space with such a property is called _ systatic _ ) .",
    "+ first of all we shall determine the levi - civita connection @xmath33 of the metric @xmath29 with respect to the left - invariant orthonormal basis @xmath34 + which is dual to the coframe + @xmath35 + we obtain @xmath36 + also , we have the well known heisenberg bracket relations @xmath37=e_3 , \\quad [ e_3,e_1]=[e_2,e_3]=0.\\ ] ] + we shall adopt the following notation and sign convention .",
    "the curvature operator is given by + @xmath38}z,\\ ] ] + while the riemann - christoffel tensor field and the ricci tensor field are given by @xmath39 + where @xmath40 are smooth vector fields on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover we put , as in @xcite or @xcite , @xmath41 + where the indices @xmath42 take the values @xmath43 .",
    "the non vanishing components of the above tensor fields are @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 + respectively , and those obtained from these by means of the symmetries of @xmath47 .",
    "thus the curvatures of @xmath0 have both positive and negative components .",
    "to study the biharmonic curves in @xmath0 , we shall use their frenet vector fields and equations .",
    "let @xmath48 be a differentiable curve parametrized by arc length and let @xmath49 be the orthonormal frame field tangent to @xmath0 along @xmath50 and defined as follows : by @xmath51 we denote the unit vector field @xmath52 tangent to @xmath50 , by @xmath53 the unit vector field in the direction of @xmath54 normal to @xmath50 , and we choose @xmath55 so that @xmath49 is a positive oriented orthonormal basis .",
    "then we have the following frenet equations @xmath56 + where @xmath57 is the geodesic curvature of @xmath50 and @xmath58 its geodesic torsion . by making use of equations and of expression of the curvature tensor field ,",
    "we obtain from the biharmonic equation for @xmath50 : @xmath59 + where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "thus we have    [ eq : theo_1 ] let @xmath48 be a differentiable curve parametrized by arc length .",
    "then @xmath50 is a non - geodesic biharmonic curve if and only if @xmath63    by analogy with curves in @xmath18 , also following @xcite , we keep the name _ helix _ for a curve in a riemannian manifold having constant both geodesic curvature and geodesic torsion .",
    "now , for any helix in @xmath0 , the system becomes @xmath64 + and therefore , in this case , @xmath65 must be constant , too .",
    "thus biharmonic helices satisfy @xmath66 + we shall come back to biharmonic helices in the next section , after showing that all the biharmonic curves in @xmath0 are helices .",
    "first we prove that for a biharmonic curve in @xmath0 the geodesic torsion must be constant .",
    "[ gener - prop ] let @xmath48 be a non - geodesic curve parametrized by arc length .",
    "if @xmath67 is constant and @xmath68 , then @xmath50 is not biharmonic .    from @xmath69",
    "we obtain @xmath70 ; then , if we put @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we get @xmath73 . hence we write @xmath74 + and then we use the first frenet equation , that gives @xmath75 + since @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 + now we replace @xmath78 in the above expression of @xmath79 , and we obtain + @xmath80 + as @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 then the second frenet equation gives @xmath83 + on the other hand we have @xmath84 + by comparing   and   we obtain @xmath85 + next we replace @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 in  , and we get @xmath89 + assume now that @xmath50 is biharmonic . then @xmath90 and we can write @xmath91 by substituting @xmath92 in   and then by integrating we get @xmath93 + where @xmath94 is a constant . on the other hand , from the second equation in  , we obtain @xmath95 . thus equation   becomes @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant , and therefore also @xmath58 is constant , and we have a contradiction",
    ".    from theorem [ eq : theo_1 ] and proposition [ gener - prop ] we have , in conclusion ,    [ eq : biharmoniccurves ] let @xmath48 be a non - geodesic curve parametrized by arc length",
    ". then @xmath50 is biharmonic if and only if @xmath98",
    "now we want to determine all helices in @xmath0 that are biharmonic but non - geodesic . from theorem [ eq : biharmoniccurves ]",
    "it is clear that , to this aim , we have to study the behaviour of @xmath92 and @xmath65 .    for one thing , it follows from ( [ eq : biharmonichelix ] ) that @xmath65 must be constant .",
    "we shall show that for a curve @xmath50 satisfying ( [ eq : biharmonichelix ] ) the constant @xmath65 can not vanish .",
    "more precisely we prove    [ 5.1 ] let @xmath48 be a non - geodesic curve parametrized by arc length .",
    "if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 and @xmath50 is not biharmonic .",
    "as @xmath50 is s parametrized by arc length , we can write @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 . by using ( [ eq : conn_1 ] ) we first have    @xmath104     + next we compute @xmath81 , and obtain @xmath105 assume now @xmath106 .",
    "we exclude the case @xmath107 , that implies @xmath108 and therefore that @xmath50 is a geodesic .",
    "thus we must have @xmath109 , and hence @xmath110 + without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath111 ( when @xmath112 one has a geodesic ) .",
    "then we have + @xmath113 and + @xmath114 + now we make use of the second frenet equation to obtain @xmath115    thus we have    [ coroelica ] let @xmath48 be a non - geodesic biharmonic helix parametrized by arc length . then @xmath116",
    "in this section we use the previous results to derive the explicit parametric equations of non - geodesic biharmonic curves in the heisenberg group @xmath0 .",
    "+ we first prove the following        in order to find the integral curves of the field given by ( [ tangelica ] ) that are biharmonic but non - geodesic , we must first determine the function @xmath126 .",
    "after which , a simple integration will give the wanted parametric equations .",
    "we shall prove    [ eq : biharmonicintegralcurves ] the parametric equations of all non - geodesic biharmonic curves @xmath50 of @xmath0 are @xmath127 + where @xmath128 , @xmath129\\cup[\\arccos(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}),\\pi)$ ] and @xmath130 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can always assume that @xmath133 .",
    "then we obtain + @xmath134 and @xmath135 + next we have @xmath136 + and @xmath137 + it follows that the geodesic torsion @xmath58 of @xmath50 is given by @xmath138          biharmonic curves   can be obtained by intersecting the two surfaces @xmath149 and @xmath150 given by : @xmath151 and @xmath152 + the surface @xmath149 has constant non zero mean curvature ; it is the `` round cylinder '' with rulings parallel to the axis of revolution of @xmath0 at the point @xmath153 and as directrix the circle in the plane @xmath154 around this point ; this circle has constant ( geodesic ) curvature also in @xmath0 .",
    "this cylinder has constant non zero mean curvature and zero gaussian curvature also in @xmath0 .",
    "the surface @xmath150 is a `` helicoid '' which is minimal in the heisenberg group @xmath0 , as one can easily check by using the formulas given by bekkar in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the biharmonic curves are geodesics of the cylinder and the cylinder is never a biharmonic surface .",
    "( with regard to the study of biharmonic surfaces , a paper devoted to invariant non - minimal biharmonic surfaces in @xmath0 is in preparation . )        at each point @xmath157 the vectors tangent to biharmonic curves form a solid cone @xmath158 in @xmath159 . for each point @xmath160 and each vector @xmath161 ,",
    "the only biharmonic curve @xmath50 arising from @xmath162 and such that @xmath163 is the geodesic determined by @xmath162 and @xmath164 .",
    "thus , any @xmath165 is simultaneously tangent to a geodesic and to a non - geodesic biharmonic curve .",
    "we visualize this fact in the following picture , where the geodesic is the curve not lying on the helicoid , while the interior edge is the biharmonic curve .",
    "let s denote by @xmath50 the curve   when @xmath166 , and by @xmath167 the curve   when @xmath168 .",
    "of course , both are helix in @xmath0 .",
    "every biharmonic curve @xmath167 can be obtained from @xmath50 by means of a left - translation , i.e. @xmath169 , and we note that @xmath50 is a helix in @xmath18 , but @xmath167 is not .",
    "the vector field @xmath51 tangent to a curve given by ( [ eq : biharmonichelices1 ] ) is transverse to the contact structure of @xmath0 ( for the contact geometry one can see , for example , @xcite ) determined by the @xmath170-form      consider now a curve @xmath48 tangent to the contact structure ( such a curve is called a _ legendre curve _ ) , parametrized by arc lengh .",
    "its velocity vector field @xmath174 has then the expression @xmath175 + it is not difficult to see that the vector fields @xmath51 and @xmath174 coincide for @xmath176 .",
    "it follows that _ the legendre curves of the heisenberg group @xmath177 are biharmonic if and only if they are geodesic . _    the one - parameter subgroups @xmath178 are biharmonic if and only if they are geodesic .",
    "in fact , if @xmath178 is not a geodesic , then @xmath67 and @xmath58 are always related by the formula ( see @xcite )        finally we note that the methods of this paper can be extended to study biharmonic curves in the cartan - vranceanu @xmath24-manifolds , namely the riemannian spaces ( @xmath180 ) , where the riemannian metrics @xmath181 are defined by @xmath182^{2 } } +   \\left(dz + \\frac{l}{2 } \\frac{ydx - xdy}{[1 + m(x^{2 } + y^{2})]}\\right)^{2 } , \\hspace{0.5 cm}l , m \\in \\r .\\ ] ] + this two - parameter family of metrics reduces to the metric ( [ metricaheis ] ) for @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( see @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and @xcite for a discussion of these metrics and their properties ) .          1 .   if @xmath189 , then @xmath190 , and we are in the euclidean space , where @xmath191 is biharmonic if and only if it is a line ; 2 .",
