    "however , the exact value of @xmath0 can not be well determined for the pulsars with narrow pulse profiles , e.g. psr 0525 + 21 ( gould & lyne 1998 ) . in this way , to determine the physical or geometrical parameters , which in sensitive to @xmath0 , becomes a remarkable problem .",
    "however we find that the ratio between the beam widths at given two frequencies are almost a constant respective to the changing of @xmath0 , and so do the ratio between the height of radiation location at two frequencies .",

    "the beam width @xmath14 can be obtained from the observed pulse width @xmath15 by @xmath16    now we calculate the height of radiation location . if the emission in different frequency comes from different magnetic field , the phase @xmath17 of a field line in the magnetic frame system as shown in fig.1 can be obtained from @xmath18 .     and @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two emission points .",
