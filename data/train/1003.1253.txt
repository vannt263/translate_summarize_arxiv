    "quantum computers are expected to be able to perform calculations which are impossible for classical computers , due to quantum entanglement and quantum parallelism @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , quantum computers seem to be extremely difficult to build because of the unavoidable noise and decoherence caused by the coupling of the qubits and the ambient environment .",
    "it is a daunting task to construct a quantum computer that has a large number of qubits and has a low error rate .",
    "however , there is a promising approach , called topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite , proposing to encode the qubit information into a topological quantum field .",
    "kitaev @xcite proposed that a system of anyons can be considered to be a quantum computer .",
    "unitary matrices are related to moving the anyons around each other .",
    "measurements are performed by joining anyons in pairs and observing the result of fusion .",
    "interference experiments @xcite are also proposed to initialize and read out quantum states .",
    "the computation is fault - tolerant by the topological nature of the system .",
    "different from fermions and bosons , which are the totally antisymmetric and the symmetric representations of the permutation group @xmath0 , anyons carry fractional charges and have fractional statistics @xcite which result in nontrivial phases ( for abelian anyons ) or matrices ( for non - abelian anyons ) for permutations .",
    "in fact , the underlying symmetry of the system of anyons is the braid group @xmath1 .",
    "abelian anyons correspond to one - dimensional representations of @xmath1 and the quantum gates one can construct from them are very limited @xcite .",
    "non - abelian anyons , on the contrary , are much more useful to tqc , since the braiding of non - abelian anyons induces non - commuting ( non - abelian ) representations of @xmath1 , from which one can construct various quantum gates .    physically , anyons are collective excitations in some condensed matter systems , such as the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) states of two dimensional electron liquids .",
    "for example , the effective theories of fqhe states with filling levels @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to abelian anyons , non - abelian moore - read @xcite and read - rezayi @xcite anyons respectively .",

    "kauffman and lomonaco @xcite studied unitary representations of braid groups in terms of @xmath9-deformed spin networks , or temperley - lieb recoupling theory @xcite .",
    "it is one of our purpose to apply the method of kauffman and lomonaco to calculate explicitly the elementary braiding operation ( ebo ) matrices which govern the exchanges of ising anyons , the first non - abelian anyons model proposed by moore and read @xcite by constructing a wave function ( the pfaffian state ) for the @xmath3 fqhe state corresponding to the @xmath10 chern - simons theory .",
    "direct experimental observation of fractional electron charge @xmath11 @xcite at the @xmath3 fqhe state gives some evidences in support of the non - abelian nature of this state .",
    "there are many works concerning the braiding properties of the ising anyons using cft method @xcite or quantum group method @xcite .",
    "nayak and wilczek @xcite suggested that the pfaffian wave functions of @xmath12 ( @xmath12 even ) ising anyons form a @xmath13 dimensional spinor irreducible representation of the rotation group @xmath14 , to which a rigorous treatment is given by georgiev recently @xcite .",
    "quantum group approach @xcite also gives equivalent results .",
    "as we will see , the ebo matrices for the ising anyons can be elegantly derived by using the temperley - lieb recoupling theory .",
    "one of the attractive properties of the ising anyons tqc model is that the excitation gap at the corresponding filling fraction @xmath15 is the highest one among all non - abelian fqhe states , resulting in a very low ( or even lower ) error rate of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "although this ising anyons model is not universal @xcite for tqc , i.e. , the braid group representations are not dense in unitary groups , it receives extensive attention in the past few years @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is proved by bravyi @xcite that no entangled states in the computational space can be obtained purely topologically and the ising anyons tqc model is classically simulatable .",
    "we show that the same conclusion can be obtained from the temperley - lieb recoupling theory approach .",
    "we should stress that this no - entanglement theorem does not mean that there is no entanglement between ising anyons at all .",
    "this rule only applies to the qubit encoding scheme ( which is consistent with the quantum circuit model ) where each qubit is encoded in 4 ising anyons . entangled quantum gates , such as controlled - z and controlled - not ( cnot ) ,",
    "can be realized purely by braiding 6 ising anyons with definite topological charge ( quantum spin ) .",
    "using the ebo matrices obtained in this paper , we construct a set of useful 1-qubit and 2-qubit quantum gates , which is not the same as , but equivalent to the construction by georgiev @xcite .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the general models of non - abelian anyons for tqc and the formalism of the temperley - lieb recoupling theory needed later .",
    "unitary representations of the braid group in the hilbert space of the degenerate ground states of non - abelian anyons are obtained by a physical argument which requires that the fusion paths of the anyons form an orthonomal basis of the hilbert space . in section 3",

    "conclusions and discussions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we first review the definition of the quantum states of a system of anyons and the temperley - lieb recoupling theory @xcite and then discuss the method to produce unitary representations of braid groups .",
    "a model of non - abelian anyons consists of the following three elements @xcite : a list of particle types , the fusion rules , and the braiding rules . in the formalism of @xmath5 chern - simons theory ,",
    "anyons are quasi - particles having half - integer @xmath9-spins ( spins for short ) @xmath17 as their quantum numbers . the fusion rules of these particles are truncated versions of the rules of addition of ordinary angular momenta , @xmath18 when a number of non - abelian anyons with definite spins fuse consecutively into a single anyon with some spin , the sequences of the intermediate spins of the fusion paths represent different quantum states of the hilbert space .",
    "anyons commonly appear as collective excitations in 2 dimensional systems .",
    "when they move , their world lines propagate in a 3 dimensional space - time .",
    "thus the exchange of a pair of anyons corresponds to the braiding of their world - lines .",
    "( we will call the braiding of the world - lines of anyons shortly as the braiding of anyons , but it is important to keep in mind what it means actually . ) in tqc , we perform quantum computations by braiding anyons to realize certain quantum gates .",
    "any braiding can be expressed as a sequence of ebos whose representations in the above hilbert space are the ebo matrices we want to find .",
    "the essential task of deriving the ebo matrices is the determination of the so called r - matrix and f - matrix introduced first in the context of cft @xcite .",
    "the former is the unitary matrix inducing the exchange of neighboring anyons with definite total spin , and the latter accounts for the associativity of fusions of anyons . in the next subsection",
    ", we will give their diagrammatic definitions in terms of the temperley - lieb recoupling theory .",

    "the artin braid group @xmath1 can be presented as a set of generators @xmath19 that obey the following relations , @xmath20 the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath21 can be presented similarly as a set of generators @xmath22 , whose representations are related to the representations @xmath23 of @xmath1 by @xmath24 where the kauffman variable @xmath25 is taken to be @xmath26 for jones polynomial at @xmath27-th roots of unity such that the quantum dimension of the spin 1/2 anyon is @xmath28 .      the basic object of the temperley - lieb recoupling theory is the jones - wenzl projector @xcite . the left graph in fig .",
