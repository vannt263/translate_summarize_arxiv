    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) is a fascinating physical phenomenon observed @xcite in high quality two dimensional electron systems due to their highly degenerate quantized band structure in a very strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the fqhe occurs in a partially filled landau level ( ll ) where coulomb interaction takes the most important part in describing @xcite its physics .",
    "the fqhe at most of the filling factors in the lowest ll , is very successfully described @xcite as an integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite of composite fermions ( cfs ) which are fermionic bound states of electrons and even ( @xmath8 ) number of quantized vortices , denoted by @xmath9cfs . due to the berry phase",
    "@xcite produced by attached vortices , cfs experience an effective magnetic field @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnetic flux quantum and @xmath12 is the electron density of the system subjected to an external magnetic field @xmath13 , and occupy some of the effective landau levels , namely lambda levels ( @xmath14ls ) , formed by @xmath15 .",
    "a complete filling of @xmath16 such @xmath14ls by non - interacting cfs successfully describes the fqhe states observed at the filling factors @xmath17 as the iqhe of cfs @xcite .",
    "possibilities of fqhe of cfs in a partially filled @xmath14l arise when the interaction between cfs is taken into account .",
    "the observation @xcite of fqhe at certain filling factors in the range @xmath18 suggests the role of the interaction between @xmath19cfs in the partially filled second @xmath14l .",
    "subsequently , the mechanisms @xcite responsible for occurring fqhe of these @xmath19cfs at certain filling factors and thereby producing incompressible states for the observed filling factors have been suggested .",
    "any filling factor within this range may be described by the effective filling factor @xmath20 of @xmath19cfs , as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) representing partially filled second @xmath14l with filling factor @xmath4 on top of the completely filled lowest @xmath14l .",
    "@xcite have shown that incompressible fqhe states with full and partial spin polarizations can arise at @xmath24 3/8 , when the @xmath19cfs , at @xmath2 , capture two more vortices to turn into @xmath25cfs and form a chiral p - wave anti - pfaffian pairing . recall that anti - pfaffian pairing correlation @xcite is degenerate with its particle - hole conjugate partner , namely pfaffian pairing , @xcite for any two - body interaction .",
    "therefore , three or higher body interaction of @xmath19cfs in the half filled @xmath14l are responsible for breaking the degeneracy . whereas an unusual interaction between the @xmath19cfs , supporting wjs , yi , and quinn ( wyq)@xcite mechanism of an unconventional suppression of cf pairs with relative angular momentum three , at @xmath26 1/3 and 2/3 , creates @xcite fully polarized incompressible states at @xmath24 4/11 and 5/13 , respectively .",

    "_ et al._@xcite a decade ago , have also indicated the existence of very weak fqhe states at 3/10 , 4/13 and 5/17 filling factors in the lowest ll .",
    "later , a resonant inelastic light scattering experiment@xcite has supported the emergence of higher order fqhe states in the corresponding filling range @xmath27 .",
    "these filling factors are described in terms of partially filled @xmath14ls produced by negative effective magnetic field experienced by @xmath25cfs as @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the fqhe at @xmath30 = 3/10 , 4/13 , and 5/17 may be described by the fqhe of @xmath25cfs with a negative effective magnetic field at @xmath4 = 1/2 , 1/3 , and 2/3 respectively , _ a la _ , fqhe of @xmath19cfs with positive effective magnetic field at @xmath4 = 1/2 , 1/3 , and 2/3 describes @xcite fqhe at @xmath30 = 3/8 , 4/11 , and 5/13 .",
    "one may thus expect that the mechanisms responsible for fqhe in the range @xmath31 will be the same for fqhe in the range @xmath32 having same @xmath4 .",
    "this expectation is however not yet theoretically met , primarily because of the technical difficulties regarding fqhe states with negative effective magnetic field for @xmath25cfs . in this paper , we have examined the possibility of forming incompressible fqhe states along with their mechanisms at these filling factors .",
    "we have modified previous algorithm @xcite for determining the projected basis states to an extent that we remove the issue of precision relating to very small values of certain variables .",
    "this has helped us to construct the fully spin polarized low energy cf basis states at the lowest ll filling factors @xmath30 = 3/10 , 4/13 , and 5/17 , where each of the electrons captures four quantized vortices to turn into a @xmath33cf and experiences a negative effective magnetic field which in turn produces @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "then , by the method of diagonalization of full coulomb hamiltonian in these truncated low energy cf basis , known as composite fermion diagonalization ( cfd)@xcite , we show that the incompressible fqhe states should occur at all these three filling factors with appropriate correlations between cfs in their second @xmath14l .",
    "we further estimate the interaction energy of the ground states in the thermodynamic limit , and minimum energy gaps for neutral excitations from the cfd spectra .",

    "ii , we show the general construction of the relationship between number of flux quanta and number of particles for fully spin polarized states of @xmath36cfs experiencing a negative @xmath15 in the range of filling factors @xmath37 . the cfd technique @xcite used for the calculation of low - lying spectra is reviewed in sec .",
