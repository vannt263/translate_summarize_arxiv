    "the pauli exclusion principle ( pep ) uncovered by wolfgang pauli in 1925 @xcite is one of the corner stones of quantum physics and thus it is at the basis of the foundation of modern physics .",
    "it is connected with spin statistics dividing the world in fermions and bosons .",
    "therefore , pep is one of the most important rules in physics .",
    "based on it is our understanding of nature and the consequences for the world of elementary particles up to compact objects ( e.g. neutron stars ) in the universe - but it is lacking a simple explanation as already stated by pauli himself .",
    "wolfgang pauli showed later in 1940 the interconnection of the principle with the spin - statistics @xcite .",
    "we know that the pauli principle is extremely well fulfilled but the the limit of validity - if any - is still an open question .",
    "even a tiny violation of pep would point to new physics which could show up at very high energies ( at the planck scale ) . in the last decades",
    "several experimental tests of pep validity for different systems have been performed @xcite . a method to experimentally test the pep",
    "was developed by ramberg - snow @xcite .",
    "pep is tested for _ fresh _ electrons , i.e. elementary particles having no interaction with the studied system thus circumventing the messiah - greenberg super - selection rule@xcite .",
    "these _ fresh _ electrons are provided by a strong electric current which is flowing through a solid metal conductor .",
    "pauli - forbidden transitions in this metal ( e.g. k transitions from the 2p state to the 1s state already filled with 2 electrons ) exhibit an significant energy shift in the transition energy which is resolvable by x - ray spectroscopy . a search for these x - ray transition events can be performed with high sensitivity but requires substantial background discrimination .",
    "it has to be noted that the _ normal _ k transitions are present due to background radiation . + in our previous vip experiment at the underground laboratory lngs ( laboratorio nazionali di gran sasso ) we used an improved ramberg - snow experimental setup exploiting charge coupled devices as x - ray detectors surrounding a solid cylindrical copper target . in this experiment",
    "we could deduce an upper limit for the pauli exclusion principle violation in the order of 10@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a strongly improved vip2 experiment will be performed in the underground laboratory lngs in gran sasso taking again advantage of the excellent shielding against cosmic rays .",
    "a strongly improved compact setup with passive and active shielding will be used .",
    "silicon drift detectors ( sdds ) will serve as x - ray detectors providing a timing signal used in anti - coincidence with scintillators ( i.e. veto counters ) to suppress actively background events .",
    "+ with the vip2 experiment we want to improve the limit for pep violation for electrons by 2 orders of magnitude reaching the range of 10@xmath2 .",
    "the basic principle of the vip experiment follows the method suggested by greenberg and mohapatra @xcite and is based on introducing _ fresh _ electrons into a copper strip . by applying an electrical current on the strip and searching for the pauli - forbidden radiative transitions to the ground state that is already filled by two electrons .",
    "we look for 2p-1s transitions in copper which are easily detectable with x - ray detectors .",
    "the energy of these non - paulian transitions is shifted from the normal transition energy by about 300 ev ( 7.729 kev instead of 8.040 kev ) due to the additional screening effect given by the two electrons in the 1s level @xcite .",
    "the measurements without the current in the copper strip provide the x - ray background , where no pep violating transitions are expected .",
    "those with the current provide the forbidden x - ray transitions when the _ fresh _ electrons could lead to pauli - forbidden transitions . comparing the two energy spectra , with and without the currents ,",
    "the limit of the probability of the violation of pep is extracted .",
    "the vip experiment was installed in the underground laboratory of lngs .",
    "this experiment used a copper cylinder as target and charge coupled devices ( ccds ) as x - ray detectors .",
    "the array of ccd detectors were used for studies of kaonic atoms @xcite .",
    "details of the vip experiment can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the measurement by the vip experiment improved very significantly the limit previously obtained by ramberg and snow @xcite , thanks to the following features:(a ) use of ccd detectors instead of gaseous ones , having much better energy resolution ( 4 - 5 times better ) and higher stability ; ( b ) experimental setup located in the clean , low - background , environment of the underground lngs laboratory ; and ( c ) collection of much higher statistics ( longer daq periods , thanks to the stability of ccds ) .",
    "we made full use of these features to obtain an improvement of several orders of magnitude on the previous limit by ramberg and snow ( see tab.1 ) .",

    "in order to achieve the signal / background increase which will allow a gain of two orders of magnitude for the probability of pep violation for electrons , we are planning to build a new target , a new cryogenic system , use new detectors with timing capability and active veto system . as x - ray detectors we will use sdds which were employed in der siddharta experiment on kaonic atoms at the dafne electron - positron collider of laboratori nazionali di frascati .",
    "sdds have an even better energy resolution than ccds but additionally provide timing capability @xcitewhich allow to use anti - coincidence operation with scintillators and therefore active shielding .",

    "we also simulated a setup with bgo inorganic crystals which yields even better background suppression , but due to the high costs of this solution , we decided to propose plastic scintillators , e.g. bicron 412 . to summarize we are confident that the goal of vip2 to reach an upper limit for possible pep violation in the order of 10@xmath2 can be reached with the improved setup ( see fig.[results - beta ] ) .",

    "in the light of the importance of the pauli exclusion principle high precision tests of this rule of nature are well justified .",
    "especially interesting are cases in which new fermions are used as test particles - in the case of vip2 fresh electrons introduced by an electric current . in vip2",
    "the background will be reduced by a factor of 200 - 400 resulting in a gain of @xmath7 15 - 20 in the expected upper limit for @xmath11/2 .",
    "together with the gain in signal the total gain improvement will excceed 2 orders of magnitude . + therefore , in the vip2 experiment the limit of the pep violation",
    "can be reached to 10@xmath2 , which is two orders of magnitude better than the previous limit of @xmath74x10@xmath0 .",
    "this limit is anticipated to be obtained taking into account a data taking period similar to that of vip1 , i.e. about 3 years ) .",
    "this incredible precision might help to prove or disprove tiny violations related to _ new physics _",
    "like e.g. superstring motivated effects @xcite .",
