    "over the years a significant and sustained research effort has been directed at understanding the effect of disorder in adsorption processes@xcite .",
    "this is commensurate with the widespread occurrence of disorder in many different kinds of adsorption , e.g. gases on solid surfaces and in porous media @xcite , biomolecules @xcite and colloidal particles @xcite adsorbing from solution onto solid surfaces , and catalysis @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the challenge is how to incorporate disorder into statistical mechanical descriptions of the equilibrium and kinetic properties . in the absence of exact results , it is desirable to develop approximate treatments , possibly by mapping the system containing disorder to a pure system with no disorder .",
    "one way to represent disorder is the random site surface ( rss ) in which adsorption sites are uniformly and randomly distributed on a plane .",
    "the adsorbent molecules , represented by hard spheres , bind to these immobile sites .",
    "steric exclusion is incorporated in the model in that a site is available for adsorption only if the nearest occupied site is at least one particle diameter away .",
    "the model is characterized by the dimensionless site density .",
    "this model was originally studied in the context of irreversible adsorption where it was shown that there exists a mapping to an irreversible adsorption process on a continuous surface @xcite .",
    "the existence of this mapping , which is exact and valid in any dimension , means that from a knowledge of the amount adsorbed as a function of time in a continuous space we can calculate the amount adsorbed on the rss surface of given site density at any time .",
    "adamczyk and coworkers have successfully applied the model and its extensions ( e.g. allowing for finite size adsorption sites ) to the adsorption of latex spheres on mica surfaces@xcite .",
    "more recently , oleyar and talbot @xcite studied the reversible version of the rss model in which hard spheres adsorb and desorb from immobilized sites in a plane . here",
    "the quantities of interest are the adsorption isotherm , i.e. the amount adsorbed as a function of the bulk phase activity of the solute and the structure of the adsorbed layer .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the theoretical description of the system in equilibrium ( even when no phase transitions intervene ) is more difficult than in the irreversible case since there appears to be no exact mapping to the reversible adsorption on a continuous surface .",
    "moreover , in one - dimension where the exact solution of the corresponding model without disorder , i.e. hard rods on a line is well known @xcite , attempts to solve the equilibrium rss have so far proved unsuccessful ( despite the fact that many one - dimensional statistical mechanical models have exact solutions ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to study a simpler model , the adsorption of dimers on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "disorder is introduced by randomly eliminating a given fraction of the sites .",
    "the advantage of the lattice model is that essentially exact solutions are available for both the pure and disordered systems .",
    "this permits us to examine the existence of a possible mapping between the two .",
    "we show that there is a mapping in the limit of small and large activities , but not in general . in the absence of a full mapping it is still useful to investigate approximate approaches that permit an accurate description of the thermodynamics of the disordered system .",
    "we note that oshanin _",
    "et al_.@xcite studied a similar lattice model for the catalytic reaction @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the introduction of an effective activity leads to highly accurate estimates of the thermodynamic properties of the disordered system .",
    "this methodology can be generalized to more realistic , off - lattice models .",
    "the system consists of adsorbed molecules which are in equilibrium with a bulk phase containing an adsorbate at activity @xmath1 .",
    "the molecules bind to sites of a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "occupancy of one site excludes occupancy of the nearest neighbor sites : see fig .",
    "[ fig : purelattice ] .",
    "we note that this model is isomorphic to the adsorption of dimers on the dual lattice @xcite . for a system consisting of @xmath2 adsorption sites",
    "the adsorbed phase can be formally described with the grand canonical partition function :    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is the site occupancy , @xmath5 is the activity and free boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "we use the superscript @xmath6 to denote the pure system , i.e. one in the absence of disorder .",
    "the exact calculation of the partition function is a simple exercise using the transfer matrix approach : see the appendix .",
    "the result can be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 $ ] is the maximum number of dimers that can be adsorbed on the lattice of size @xmath2 ( @xmath9 $ ] represents the integer part of @xmath10)@xcite .",
    "the average number of dimers adsorbed on a chain of @xmath2 sites at an activity @xmath1 is given by @xmath11 and the fraction of occupied sites can be computed as @xmath12 which in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath13 this has the expected behavior in the limits of small ( langmuir isotherm ) and large ( half of the sites are occupied ) activities .",
    "the susceptibility , or fluctuation in the number of adsorbed molecules , is given by @xmath14 after some calculation one obtains that , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath15      we now consider a diluted site model in which only a fraction of randomly selected sites are present .",
    "the grand partition function in this case is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the absence or presence of an adsorption site @xmath18 .",
    "the probability of finding an adsorbing site is given by @xmath19 there are no correlations between sites .",
    "a sample configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .    for a given site configuration @xmath20 ,",
    "the number of clusters of exactly @xmath21 contiguous adsorption sites is given by @xmath22 the mean number of clusters of size @xmath21 is then given by @xmath23 one can check that the sum rule characterizing the total number of occupied sites is verified , namely @xmath24 note that the thermodynamic limit has been taken in the two equations : corrections for a finite system occurs for @xmath25 and need not be included in these calculations .    since the adsorption site occupancies are quenched variables , the average over disorder is taken over the logarithm of the partition function , with the following result : @xmath26 where we have used the result for the partition function of a finite lattice of @xmath21 connected sites ( i.e. the pure model ) with free boundary conditions .",
    "the mean density of adsorbed dimers is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average number of dimers on a ( full ) lattice of size @xmath21 with free boundary conditions .",
    "for small site density , one easily obtains @xmath29    on the other hand , whatever the site density , when the activity @xmath30 , @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 , so that one obtains @xmath35 which gives @xmath36 a result identical to the case of hard rods onto a line with random sites@xcite .",

    ", we consider the thermodynamic quantities , in particular we focus on the susceptibility .    in the presence of disorder , there are two kinds of susceptibility : the connected susceptibility @xmath38 describing the thermal fluctuations of the density of adsorbed particles and the disconnected susceptibility @xmath39 describing the disorder - induced fluctuations of the density of adsorbed particles .",
    "the connected susceptibility is given by the thermodynamic relation @xcite @xmath40 for large activities , the connected susceptibility goes to @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "this result has a simple physical interpretation . for a given realization of the disorder ,",
    "the densest configuration is selected when @xmath30 . in this limit fluctuations",
    "are suppressed , and the connected susceptibility vanishes .",
    "the disconnected susceptibility is given by the second cumulant ( in the average over the disorder ) of the number of adsorbed dimers for a given configuration of the disorder , @xmath43 : @xmath44    the different terms of the disorder average @xmath45 can be obtained by sorting out configurations of overlapping and non - overlapping clusters :    1 .   when @xmath46 , there is a contribution when the two clusters are in the same location , and @xmath47 .",
    "2 .   when two clusters have a boundary in common , @xmath48 , the factor @xmath49 coming from the two possibilities , right and left .",
    "3 .   when two clusters have overlapping sites , @xmath50 and the number of possibilities is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "4 .   for all other configurations",
    ", there is no overlap between clusters and @xmath52 : this corresponds to @xmath53 configurations .    after some calculation , one obtains that @xmath54    in the large - activity limit , @xmath55 , one easily shows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pfp ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) that @xmath56 and    @xmath57    from eqs  ( [ eq:6 ] ) , ( [ eq:5 ] ) , ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) the following expression of @xmath58 now results : @xmath59 finally , by inverting eq.([eq:9 ] ) , the disconnected susceptibility is obtained as @xmath60 which is _ identical to the susceptibility in a pure system at the same density _ ( eq.([eq:10 ] ) ) .",
    "since @xmath61 , this result establishes that the _ total _ fluctuations of the adsorbed number of dimers is the same in the disordered system at infinite activity and in the pure system at the same mean adsorbed density , @xmath62 .",
    "this points to the existence of an exact mapping between the two systems under these conditions .",
    "the mapping can actually be proven by extending the above considerations to the correlation functions .",
    "is the mapping exact for finite activities ? in order to answer this question , we compare @xmath63 and @xmath64 for small values of @xmath37 . the first orders of the expansions read @xmath65 where we have combined eqs .",
    "[ eq:10 ] and [ eq : rsmall ] , and @xmath66    it is noticeable that the expansions coincide at first and second order , but differ at third order and above .",
    "we speculate that this property is general in the sense that it is independent of the model ( dimers , k - mers , hard rods , ... ) and of the dimension .",
    "in addition , one can see that the two expansions approach the same limit when the activity is very large .",
    "this means that they differ maximally for intermediate values of the activity . in any case",
    ", the above considerations prove that no mapping exists between the correlation functions of the disordered system at finite activity and those of the pure system at the same density , @xmath67 .",
    "the lattice model studied here is exceptional in that we know its exact solution , even when disorder is present .",
    "more often , we will have only a partial description , e.g. the cluster expansion that applies at low site density in the case of the rss @xcite . in these cases , we seek approximate schemes that can provide an accurate description of the adsorption isotherms for the full range of site densities and activities . in this section",
    "we propose two such schemes and evaluate their accuracy by comparing with the exact results .",
    "one approach involves a partial resummation of the site density expansion of eq.([eq:11 ] ) .",
    "specifically , retaining explicitly the first term that appears at all orders we can write @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents the remaining terms in the exact expansion and , consistent with these terms , has the property that @xmath70 when @xmath71 and @xmath55 .",
    "the simplest approximation is to set @xmath72 , resulting in the approximate isotherm @xmath73 that , as expected , has the correct behavior in the limits of small and large activities .    in order to highlight the deviations from the exact results , we have plotted in fig.[fig : rho ] the density @xmath62 as a function of the activity @xmath1 for various values of the site density @xmath74 .",
    "the approximate isotherms always overestimate the adsorbed density for all activities .",
    "the deviations increase with the site density and are most pronounced at intermediate activities . in order to understand the origin of this discrepancy",
    ", we have performed an asymptotic expansion of eq.([eq:11 ] ) at large activity , @xmath75 and compared with that of eq .",
    "[ eq:12 ] , @xmath76 we note that when @xmath77 , eq.([eq:14 ] ) and eq.([eq:15 ] ) coincide .",
    "this explains the very accurate description of the approximate isotherm in this limit .",
    "conversely , when @xmath78 , one obtains @xmath79 whereas no such combination in @xmath80 appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) .    by including the leading term of the asymptotic behavior , eq.([eq:14 ] ) , the agreement with the exact result is only correct up to intermediate @xmath74 .",
    "it would be necessary to add additional terms when @xmath74 goes to @xmath81 in order to have a good approximation of the isotherms .",
    "such a procedure rapidly becomes very complicated and is not useful for more realistic models .",
    "the asymptotic analysis seems to indicate that the neglected terms of the series correspond to the existence of an asymptotic series whose variable is @xmath82 .",
    "an alternative approach uses an effective activity , @xmath83 , instead of @xmath84 .",
    "the idea is to estimate the density in the disordered system with @xmath85 where @xmath86 corresponds to the density at equilibrium given by eq.([eq:13 ] ) .",
    "note that , since there is no exact mapping to a pure system for a finite activity @xmath1 , even if we could find the function @xmath87 that satisfies eq .",
    "[ eq : leff ] , it would not give exact results for other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "there is , however , merit in this approach because , as we have shown in previous sections , there is a mapping in the limits of large and small activities .",
    "thus , by using eq.([eq:14 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) , one obtains the asymptotic expansion @xmath88 the coefficient of the leading term of this expansion is a function of @xmath74 which behaves simply in the two limits @xmath77 and @xmath89 . by combining with the low - activity expansion ( @xmath90 ) , we propose the following interpolation scheme @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a @xmath93 $ ] pad approximant . the isotherms",
    "are then calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff ] ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] , even to zeroth order ( @xmath94 ) , this route gives a significantly better approximation than eq.([eq:12 ] ) . by matching the exact asymptotic behavior , eq.([eq:16 ] ) , as well as the second - order low - activity expansion , one obtains @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97    since the zeroth order approximation is practically indistinguishable from the exact result in the isotherm plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ) , we highlight the differences between the two by plotting the effective activity versus the activity for high density @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the asymptotic value , the full line to the exact result , the dotted line to the zeroth order , and the dashed line to the first - order .",
    "we note that this method converges very rapidly to the exact result , even at high @xmath74 , which is very encouraging for systems where no exact result is known .",
    "we can thus conclude from the present study that ( i ) there is a mapping between the adsorbed configurations of dimers on a diluted one - dimensional lattice and those on a full lattice at the same adsorbed density in the two limits of small and large activities ; ( ii ) this mapping does not extend to finite activities .",
    "however , a successful approximation scheme is provided by considering a pseudo - mapping through the introduction of an effective activity .",
    "the scheme has been tested on the present one - dimensional lattice system for which we have also obtained exact expressions , and work is in progress to apply it to more realistic situations .",
    "to obtain an analytic expression for the partition function of the pure system we use the transfer matrix method : see , e.g. @xcite . using this approach , eq.([eq:1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 performing the trace operation , the partition function becomes @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath104 , @xmath105 for finite @xmath2 the partition function is a polynomial in @xmath1 , e.g. @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , ... in the thermodynamic limit , only the largest eigenvalue contributes to the thermodynamic quantities and we have @xmath110"
