    "the most recent data gathered by wmap @xcite is consistent with the hypothesis that the perturbations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) were generated in an era of cosmic inflation .",
    "this is generally achieved with a slowly rolling scalar field which leads to an exponential expansion of the universe and the observed anisotropy is generated by the fluctuations of this inflaton field @xcite .",
    "such a minimal scenario leads to adiabatic and gaussian perturbations in accordance with the current data .",
    "a well motivated alternative to the simplest inflationary scenario is the curvaton mechanism @xcite in which the perturbations are generated by a second scalar field , called the curvaton , which stays subdominant during inflation and the actual expansion of space is still driven by the inflaton .",
    "this allows the inflation potential to have more natural properties compared to the single field scenario @xcite .",
    "however , the extra degrees of freedom in the system now allow for the possibility that the final state is not necessarily purely adiabatic .",
    "instead , the generation of an observable amount of isocurvature perturbations is a possibility that can distinguish the curvaton scenario from the simple single field inflationary model .    early models of curvaton cosmology usually assumed that the decay of the curvaton field produces only radiation @xcite .",
    "later models included the possibility of radiation and matter production @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have expanded this line of thought to include the possibility that the curvaton decays into two non - interacting relativistic components .",
    "this makes it possible to model a cold dark matter component that is initially relativistic but turns non - relativistic as the universe expands and dilutes the energy densities .",
    "this process can lead to some interesting consequences : for example the curvature perturbations of matter are no longer conserved after curvaton decay if the decay occurs when the matter component is still relativistic .",
    "in addition to the background evolution we will also solve numerically the first and second order perturbation equations with different initial values and search for physically plausible initial values in a parameter space based on the initial values of these variables . besides studying the correctness of the thermodynamical evolution of the system we will also calculate the generated level of non - gaussianity and compare it to the limits given by wmap 5 year data @xcite .",

    "the initial hubble parameter value can be calculated from these variables and the interaction strengths @xmath39 vary from @xmath106 to @xmath107 thereby defining the resolution of the simulations . in the usual curvaton hypothesis the curvaton field is usually assumed to be subdominant after inflation and the relativistic decay products of inflaton dominate the energy density .",
    "the initial temperature of the system is therefore closely related to the reheating temperature .",

    "note that when starting the simulations equations ( [ eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : beta-2 ] ) are clearly ill defined when @xmath109 .",
    "we have therefore set initially @xmath110 which can be interpreted that when the simulation starts , the decay of the curvaton field has already started .",
    "the initial dark matter temperature , @xmath33 , has been set to be two orders of magnitude smaller in value than the radiation temperature .",
    "other values might lead to numerical problems during the evaluations and this selection leads to very small initial dark matter fractional densities , @xmath111 .",
    "the amount of curvaton in the system is also a free parameter .",

    "since we have made weak assumptions on the type of the dark matter , the mass @xmath54 can have a wide range of different values ( a review of different dark matter particle models can be found for example in @xcite ) .",
    "the only limitations are that initially dark matter is relativistic @xmath87 and that it does not interact with radiation .",

    "points that also satisfy the radiation matter equality limit , @xmath97 , are around the outer edge of this nucleosynthesis region . despite the easened limitations for the equality temperature ,",
    "this clearly gives only a very narrow region of plausible initial values .",
    "in terms of the naturalness of the curvaton scenario , the decay widths of the curvaton are limited to be very small if the system is compelled to satisfy the previously presented physicality tests .",
    "smaller initial temperatures and dark matter particle mass allow larger values but even in this case the decay widths require fine - tuning .",
    "we have studied the behavior of a three fluid curvaton decay model when the possibility of more complex thermodynamics of the cold dark matter decay product have been also taken into account .",
    "the assumptions we have made are relatively loose : the decay products of the curvaton were assumed to be non - interacting .",
    "this is quite a natural , if the other fluid is interpreted as conventional radiation and the other as dark matter .",
    "the system was simulated for a wide range of different initial values including initial temperature , dark matter particle mass and curvaton decay widths .",
    "this made it possible to study the naturalness of the curvaton model in this model .",
    "we found that the generated non - gaussianity in the system can be considerable but these large values are reached with initial values that do not lead to physically sound evolution for the system .",
    "the non - gaussianity is therefore expected to be of the same order as in the simple inflaton models @xcite .    in terms of the dark matter particle mass , @xmath54 , the curvaton model leads to physically sound evolution with a range of different values but not without fine tuning in the decay widths .",
    "lower initial temperatures and mass @xmath54 easen this issue but not considerably .",
    "we therefore conclude that the current curvaton decay model is not satisfactory from the point of view of naturalness .    according to our analysis ,",
    "a related , but more viable and physically sound model could be the curvaton decay into weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite .",
    "interactions between cold dark matter and photons would keep them at the same temperature in the early universe until they freeze - out as the temperature drops below their mass . the same strategy we used here could be applied also to this scenario to study the naturalness of the curvaton wimp scenario .",
