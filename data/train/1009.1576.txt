    "the recurrent nature of the solutions to the 2d euler equation depends crucially upon the geometry of the domain containing the fluid . here the specific geometry ( rather than topology ) is fundamental .",
    "we are interested in three types of domains :    * periodic cell @xmath3 \\times [ 0 , \\ell_y]$ ] , which is a period cell in @xmath4 where the fluid flow is under periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions with periods @xmath7 and @xmath8 . * channel cell @xmath9 \\times [ 0 , a]$ ] , which is a channel cell of the channel @xmath10 $ ] where the fluid flow is under periodic boundary condition in @xmath5 direction with period @xmath7 , and non - penetrating conition along the walls @xmath11 . * annulus @xmath12 in polar coordinates , where the fluid flow is under non - penetrating conition along the walls @xmath13 .    for the fluid domain @xmath14 ,",
    "the solutions to the 2d euler equation are recurrent somewhere along the orbit in the @xmath15 norm of velocity @xcite . below",
    "we will show that this is also true for the fluid domain @xmath16 .",
    "for the fluid domain @xmath17 , we believe that this is no longer true . in the @xmath17 case , the enstrophy is not equivalent to the @xmath18 norm of velocity .",
    "for example , @xmath19 is an irrotational steady solution of the 2d euler equation .",
    "its vorticity is zero , while its @xmath18 norm is non - zero .",
    "the argument of @xcite for recurrence depends crucially upon the equivalence of the enstrophy to the @xmath18 norm of velocity .    on the other hand , for the fluid domain @xmath17",
    ", there is an initial condition such that for any other initial condition in a @xmath20 vorticity neighborhood , the solution never returns to the @xmath20 vorticity neighborhood @xcite @xcite .",
    "the inner and outer circles of the annulus play a fundamental role in the the construction of this example .",
    "it is the multiconnectness nature of the annulus that makes the example possible .",
    "the irrotational steady solution ( [ pr ] ) is also fundamental in the construction of the example . for the @xmath14 and @xmath16 cases",
    ", we do not believe the non - recurrent example of the @xmath17 case exists , since the irrotational solution ( [ pr ] ) does not exist .",
    "the recurrence in @xmath15 norm of velocity is a result of two main ingredients : ( 1 ) .",
    "the conservation of energy and enstropy , ( 2 ) .",
    "the equivalence of the enstrophy to the @xmath18 norm of velocity .",
    "the first ingredient is also credited for generating the well - studied phenomenon , the so - called forward energy cascade and inverse enstrophy cascade , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the 2d inviscid channel flow is governed by @xmath21 subject to the boundary condition @xmath22 here we also pose periodic boundary condition along @xmath5-direction ( of period @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "our first goal here is to reach a setting that the spatial averages of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are zero .",
    "this setting is not necessary for proving the recurrence , but it is an interesting fact itself . by the incompressibility condition",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath28 using the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) , one gets @xmath29 thus the spatial average of @xmath27 is zero .",
    "denote by @xmath30 the spatial average of @xmath26 @xmath31 the inviscid channel flow ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) together with its boundary conditions are invariant under the transformation : @xmath32 together with ( [ v ] ) , without loss of generality , we can assume that the spatial averages of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are zero .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the kinetic energy and enstrophy @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the vorticity , are invariant under the inviscid channel flow .",
    "next we will show that @xmath35 is equivalent to the @xmath18 norm of velocity .      by the incompressibility condition ( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath37\\ dx dy = -2 \\int_a^b \\int_0^{l_x } ( { \\partial}_xu ) ( { \\partial}_yv ) \\ dx dy .\\ ] ] notice that @xmath38 \\ dx dy \\\\ & & = \\int_a^b \\int_0^{l_x } \\left [ { \\partial}_y ( v{\\partial}_xu ) - { \\partial}_x ( v{\\partial}_yu)\\right ] \\ dx dy   = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term vanishes due to the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) and the second term vanishes due to the periodicity along @xmath5-direction .",
    "using the above two facts , we have @xmath39\\ dx dy \\\\ & = & \\int_a^b \\int_0^{l_x } \\left [ ( { \\partial}_yu)^2 + ( { \\partial}_xv)^2 - 2 ( { \\partial}_xu ) ( { \\partial}_yv ) \\right ] \\ dx dy \\\\ & = & \\int_a^b \\int_0^{l_x } \\left [ ( { \\partial}_yu)^2 + ( { \\partial}_xv)^2 - 2 ( { \\partial}_yu ) ( { \\partial}_xv ) \\right ] \\ dx dy = g .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      by the fact ( [ v ] ) , @xmath46 by the poincar inequality for @xmath47 and the fact that the @xmath6-average of @xmath47 is zero , @xmath48 without the facts of ( [ v ] ) and the vanishing of the @xmath6-average of @xmath47 , we can still carry out the rest argument of the paper by replacing @xmath35 with @xmath49 in the above definition of @xmath45 . the above lemma is the well - known rellich lemma . in a simpler language , an enstrophy ball is compactly embedded in the kinetic energy space .",
    "the proof below follows that of @xcite .",
    "@xmath50    by lemma [ equ ] , @xmath51 starting from the representation ( [ vft ] ) , we expand @xmath52 into a fourier integral @xmath53 where ( ignoring a constant factor ) @xmath54 let @xmath55 be a sequence in @xmath45 .",

    "then we can find a sequence @xmath74 in @xmath45 such that @xmath75 let @xmath76 be the convergent subsequence , then @xmath77 is also a convergent subsequence .",
