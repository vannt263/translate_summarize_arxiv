    "maxwell equations ( m - eqs . ) are one of the most fundamental theoretical frameworks of physics , dealing with the interaction between electromagnetic ( em ) field and charged particles with magnetic moment , which describes the em response in both static and dynamical regimes .",
    "they consist of four laws , i.e. , gauss laws for electricity and magnetism , ampere s law and faraday s law .",
    "there are two forms of them , i.e. , microscopic and macroscopic m - eqs . , and",
    "both are actively used for research and education .",
    "the fundamental formulas and definitions about micro- and macroscopic m - eqs . are given with usual notations in appendix a.    historically , macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "appeared first as a consistent set of the four equations mentioned - above for macroscopic matter systems .",
    "it was a phenomenology , since nothing was known about electrons , quantum mechanics and relativity at that time .",
    "as the particle picture of matter was established , one could correctly transform macroscopic m - eqs . to microscopic ones describing the em field in microscopic systems @xcite .",
    "the microscopic form , combined with quantum mechanics and relativity , lead to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which is the most accurate theory of physics in precise agreement with experiments @xcite .    on the other hand , the particle picture of matter in combination with quantum mechanics has been used to promote macroscopic m - eqs . from a phenomenological level to a semiquantitative one by treating susceptibilities , not as parameters , but as the quantities to be calculated quantum mechanically .",
    "it is based on the viewpoint that macroscopic behavior of em field must somehow be derived from the averaged motions of microscopic em fields and charged particles .",
    "this type of rewriting has been called the _ derivation _ of macroscopic from microscopic m - eqs . , and such semiquantitative m - eqs . in terms of the field variables",
    "`` @xmath9 '' have been used with much success for the studies of macroscopic em response in a vast area .    however , in spite of the long history with great success , the macroscopic scheme in terms of `` @xmath10 '' seems to be incomplete in comparison with microscopic one with respect to the follwing points .    1 .",
    "lack of explanation why the number of susceptibility tensors are different betweeen microscopic and macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "2 .   lack of uniqueness in dividing charge density into true and polarization charge densities 3 .",
    "lack of uniqueness in dividing transverse current density into the contributions of magnetic and electric polarizations 4 .",
    "different wave number dependence of magnetic permeability @xmath5 for two types of magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions , i.e. , spin and orbital m1 resonances    the details of each point are explained below .    1 .   in the derivation of macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "from microscopic ones , which can be found in many textbooks of electromagnetism @xcite , it is admitted from the beginning that the two vector fields , i.e. , electric and magnetic polarizatoins , are the fundamental quantities of macroscopically averaged matter .",
    "this is , however , not obvious , because in the more basic microscopic m - eqs .",
    "the dynamical variable of matter for em response is a single vector field , i.e. , `` current density '' .",
    "( charge density is not an independent variable , since it is related with current density via continuity equation . )",
    "this means that the number of constitutive equations ( or susceptibilities ) is different between the microscopic and macroscopic m - eqs .. it is not obvious that macroscopic averaging requires such an increase in the number of constitutive equations @xcite .",
    "+ for systems with chiral symmetry , where elecrtic field can induce elecrtic , as well as magnetic polarization , ( and magnetic field can induce magnetic , as well as electric polarizations , ) a phenomenological approach by drude - born - fedorov ( dbf ) constitutive equations is known to be useful @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( see appendix a. ) this scheme requires an additional ( chiral ) susceptibility .",
    "then , the number of suseptibility in macroscopic m - eqs . is increased to three , in further contrast with microscopic m - eqs .",
    "it is obvious that the separation of a given charge density @xmath11 into true and polarization charge densities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , can not be done uniquely .",
    "since the only constraint is the charge neutrality @xmath14 , there are infinitely many ways to rewrite @xmath15 into @xmath16 .",
    "because of the continuity equation , this problem can be rephrased as the non - uniqueness of separating the longitudinal ( l ) component of current density @xmath17 into the conduction current density @xmath18 and the l component of the current density @xmath19 induced by electric polarization @xmath20 .",
    "a similar problem exists in separating the transverse ( t ) component of @xmath17 into magnetization ( @xmath21 ) induced current density @xmath22 and the t component of @xmath20-induced current density @xmath23 . in order to do this division uniquely , we need to define @xmath20 and @xmath21 precisely , which , however , is not always possible .",
    "beause in chiral symmetry the electric dipole ( e1 ) and magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions are mixed , which allows @xmath20 induced by magnetic , as well as electric field and @xmath21 induced by electric , as well as magnetic field .",
    "then , there is no unique way to separate @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the problem about @xmath24 is the absence of its general expression including the contributions from both spin resonance and orbital magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions .",
    "since the deviation of @xmath24 from unity is due to the m1 transitions of matter system , one would expect similar forms of resonant terms for both transitions .",
    "however , the conventional ways to write the two contributions are different with respect to their dependence on the wave number of the resonant em waves . in the case of spin resonance @xcite , a typical magnetic susceptibility has the form @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 is the transition energy of a spin resonance , and @xmath27 the squared transition matrix element of spin magnetization operator . the resultant expression @xmath28 does not contain the wave number of the resonant em field except for @xmath29 in the denominator . on the other hand ,",
    "m1 component of orbital transitions , which occur in any energy regions including nuclear transitions ( e.g. , mssbauer transitions ) , produces an em field with an amplitude proportional to the product of the resonant wave number @xmath30 and the magnetic dipole moments of the transition , according to the standard multipole expansion of the em field @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath24 in this case has a resonant term of intensity proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the two cases of m1 transition apparently show different @xmath30 dependences of @xmath24 .",
    "+ another difficulty about @xmath5 is that , in the standard dispersion equation @xmath32 , there appears the product , not the sum , of electric and magnetic contributions in spite of linear response treatment .",
    "if we consider the possibility of the mixing of electric and magnetic excitations in chiral symmetry , there is no essential distinction between them as matter excitations .",
    "therefore , it would be more reasonable to have their contributions as a sum , rather than as a product , in the dispersion relation of linear response .",
    "though this problem looks different from the one in the previous paragraph , it turns out later that they have a common origin .    to the author s understanding",
    ", the origin of the incompleteness mentioned above lies in the use of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the independent , fundamental variables in deriving macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "this independence is questionable , if we think of chiral symmetry where electric and magntic transitions contributing to @xmath20 and @xmath21 are mixed with each other . as a logic to derive macrosacopic m - eqs . in the conventional manner , it is necessary to show the general definition of @xmath20 and @xmath21 from the first principles , i.e. , from the precisely defined matter hamiltonian and matter - em field interaction . as will be discussed in sec .",
    "3.1 , one would realize the incompleteness from the very effort to derive the matter - em field interaction in an appropriate form to calculate electric and magnetic susceptibilities from the first principles .    therefore ,",
    "in order to find right answers to the problems mentioned above , we need to use a new and more reliable logic in deriving macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "as such , we start from a microscopic response theory , a most reliable basis for the em response of matter in semiclassical regime . in this scheme ,",
    "all the details of matter states are described quantum mechanically , and all the wavelength components of em field are taken into account in a semiclassical way .",
    "matter hamiltonian and matter - em field interaction are precisely defined from the lagrangian for a general interacting system of charged particles and em field , and explicit spin dependence is considered as relativistic corrections . in the microscopic response theory ,",
    "we solve , so to speak , schrdinger eq . and micoscopic m - eqs .",
    "selfconsistently , or more specifically , the coupled integral equations for induced current density and vector potential , which contain all the wavelength components .",
    "this way of solution becomes feasible due to the separability of the microscopic nonlocal susceptibility as an integral kernel , as will be shown in sec.2 .",
    "we call this scheme `` microscopic nonlocal response '' .    then ,",
    "as a straighforward procedure of macroscopic averaging , we apply long wavelength approximation ( lwa ) to the coupled integral equations .",
    "thereby , we do not assume or request to recover the conventional form of macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "but just take the outcome as a logical consequence of this approach and compare the result with conventional form . here",
    "also , the separability of microscopic susceptibility plays an essential role to give an explicit form of macroscopic susceptibility quantum mechanically .",
    "this type of derivation has never been done before to the author s knowledge , and in fact it gives reasonable answers to all the problems mentioned above .",
    "it should be noted that this approach describes the macroscopic averaging , not just as a concept which might allow various interpretations , but as an unambiguous mathematical procedure of lwa applied to the well - defined integral equations of microscopic nonlocal response .",
    "this enables us , in principle , to check the validity condition for the approximation , since we clearly know what is discarded by lwa .",
    "this point will be discussed in sec.3.5 .",
    "the most remarkable result is that the m - eqs . remain in the same form after applying lwa , and the only difference between the micro- and macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "lies in the form of the susceptibility . among several proposals of the single susceptibility scheme of macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "@xcite , the present one is on an advanced level in the sense that all the components of susceptibility are given in a qunatum mechanical way , which , in principle , allows microscopic evaluation , and that it is a logical consequence from the more basic microscopic response scheme .",
    "detailed discussions will be given in sec.3.2 .",
    "the existing schemes of m - eqs . in the semiclassical regime",
    "are classified into the following hierarchy in the order of decreasing accuracy : ( i ) microscopic nonlocal response , ( ii ) the new macroscopic scheme , ( iii ) the conventional `` @xmath4 and @xmath5 '' scheme . via lwa , ( i ) reduces to ( ii ) , and ( iii ) is obtained from ( ii ) in the absence of chirality and by the use of magnetic susceptibility @xmath33 defined with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "the justification of the step from ( ii ) to ( iii ) goes in a clear cut way as shown later , but a similar argument is not possible for the justification of the dbf equations for chiral symmetry , so that the dbf eqs .",
    "should stay outside the hierarchy as a phenomenology .",
    "the use of @xmath33 is , not only a logical consequence , but also the solution of the problem 4 ) . rewriting the dispersion equation @xmath34 in terms of @xmath35 ) ,",
    "obtained from @xmath36 and @xmath28 , we immediately see the solutions for the both problems of 4 ) , which will be discussed in sec.2.4 in more details .",
    "the requirement to use @xmath33 will be a considerable impact on the study of lhm . in sec.3.4",
    "an observable difference is demonstrated in the forms of dispersion curve and reflectivity spectrum in a lhm situation for the cases of assigning magnetic excitation energy to the pole of @xmath37 and @xmath33 .",
    "macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "are still an important tool in many research fields , such as photonic crystals @xcite , left - handed materials ( lhm ) or metamaterials @xcite , near field optics @xcite , and so on . for this reason and also for its importance in the elementary course of physics education",
    ", it is worth looking for a more complete form of macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "especially the present investigation , which raises a question @xcite about the validity of the veselago s condition for lhm \" @xmath38 @xcite , has direct relevance to the today s very popular subject , lhm .",
    "the results of this work would affect ( at least ) the research fields mentioned above on the very fundamental level .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we give a precise definitin of matter hamiltonian and matter - em field interaction , set up the simultaneous integral equations of microscopic nonlocal response , and , by applying lwa , extract the macroscopic components , which leads to a new macroscopic susceptibility @xmath39 . the dispersion equation in terms of @xmath39",
    "is derived , and the conditions to reproduce the conventional one are studied .",
    "discussions are given in sec.3 about ( i ) the interaction hamiltonian in the form explicitly containing @xmath40 and @xmath3 , and the condition for defining @xmath41 and @xmath37 separately ,",
    "( ii ) the comparison with other macroscopic theories , ( iii ) the comparison with the result of dbf eqs . for chiral symmetry ,",
    "( iv ) the consequence in the lhm studies ,",
    "( v ) the validity condition of lwa , and ( vi ) simplification of @xmath39 with parameters . in sec.4",
    ", we summarize the important results .",
    "we start from the well - known lagrangian for charged particles in em field @xmath42 where @xmath0 and @xmath43 are the vector and scalar potentials , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the charge , coordinate and velocity of the @xmath47-th particle , respectively . from the least action principle for this lagrangian",
    ", we obtain the fundamental equations of the system , i.e. the microscopic m - eqs . and the newton equation of each particle under lorentz force .    the microscopic m - eqs .",
    "are given in coulomb gauge as ( @xmath48 ) , as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the t component of @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath51 , and the charge density @xmath15 and current density @xmath17 are defined as @xmath52    the matter hamiltonian including the interaction with em field takes the form @xmath53 ^ 2              + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum\\sum_{\\ell\\neq\\ell\\ ' \\ \\ \\ \\ }             \\frac{e_{\\ell}e_{\\ell\\ ' } } { |\\vec{r}_{\\ell } - \\vec{r}_{\\ell\\ ' } | } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in coulomb gauge , where momentum @xmath54 is defined by eq.([eqn : b4x ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-linear part of this hamiltonian @xmath55 represents the linear light - matter interaction , and the @xmath0-independent part is the pure matter hamiltonian .",
    "if one needs relativistic corrections , we add spin - orbit interaction , mass velocity term , and darwin term to the matter hamiltonian .",
    "spin zeeman term can be added to @xmath56 because of their similar form as @xmath57 where the current density due to spin magnetization is @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 being the spin magnetic moment of the @xmath47-th particle with spin @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the matter hamiltonian is @xmath62 including the relativistic correction @xmath63 , and the matter - em field interaction @xmath64 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the generalized current density operator , containing the contributions from both electric polarization and `` spin and orbital '' magnetization .",
    "the microscopic m - eqs . including this generalization is @xmath67    how to handle static em field will depend on problems .",
    "if we calculate static susceptibility , we will put the corresponding term in @xmath64 .",
    "if we are interested , e.g. , in electron spin resonance or cyclotron resonance , however , we should put the static field part in @xmath68 and the time dependent part to @xmath64 .",
    "another point of importance in considering em response is how to treat l electric field induced in matter system .",
    "it can arise from true charge density and electric polarization .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that matter system has no true charges ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "its dynamically perturbed state is described by oscillating charge and current densities .",
    "the polarization charge density @xmath70 induces l electric field as @xmath71 which is a part of maxwell field @xmath40 .",
    "its interaction energy with the polarization of the matter can be rewritten as the coulomb interaction energy among the induced charge density , @xmath72    this leads us to a dichotomy , whether ( a ) we regard @xmath73 as an internal field of matter , taking full coulomb interaction into the matter hamiltonian , or ( b ) we regard @xmath73 as a part of the external source field to induce polarization , taking the coulomb interaction ( [ eqn : rho - rho - int ] ) as the interaction between the `` external field '' and matter polarization , i.e. , omitting it from the coulomb interaction energy of the matter . since the omitted part of the coulomb energy contributes to the energy difference between the t and l mode configurations , the scheme ( a ) contains the different t and l mode energies as the pole positions of susceptibility , while ( b ) reveals the effect of lt splitting , not in the susceptibility , but in response spectra . though the two schemes lead to the same observable result , there is a considerable difference in the intermediate steps .    in this paper , we take the viewpoint ( a ) .",
    "namely , we define the matter hamiltonian as the sum of kinetic energy and ( complete ) coulomb interaction of all the charged particles , and @xmath73 is not considered as external field .",
    "thus the poisson equation contributes to the internal motion of matter , relevant to its quantum mechanical eigenstates , and only the second equation of ( [ eqn : m - eqs - coul ] ) represents the interaction between matter and em field .",
    "( if we were to take the viewpoint ( b ) , we would treat @xmath74 as the interaction term , and omit ( [ eqn : rho - rho - int ] ) from the coulomb interaction of eq.([eqn : m - hamilton ] ) . using these matter hamiltonian and matter - em field interaction",
    ", we could calculate the time development of the operators @xmath75 according to the method in the next section . )",
    "also we assume that the incident em field is t mode , i.e. , we do not consider the excitation by external charged particle .",
    "thus , in the coulomb gauge , which is a natural choice for matter systems in non - relativistic regime , the matter hamiltonian contains the full coulomb interaction , and the external em field is t - mode alone , i.e. , @xmath0 or @xmath76 . after determining the response",
    ", we can calculate @xmath77 from the induced charge or current density .",
    "( if we were to consider the excitation by external charged particle , which will be treated in a later publication , we would add an extra term @xmath78 to @xmath64 . the external l field @xmath79 and an external charge density @xmath80",
    "are similarly related as in eq.([eqn : e - vs - rho ] ) . in terms of the matter - em field interaction , @xmath81 , we could calculate the induced current density , electric polarization , and magnetization as the expectation values of the corresponding operators . )      in order to determine the microscopic response , we only need to have the microscopic constitutive equation between @xmath82 and @xmath0 , which is to be solved selfconsistently with eq.([eqn : m - eqs - i ] ) .",
    "the microscopic calculation of induced current density can be found in various textbooks as e.g. , @xcite , but the outline of the lowest order perturbation calculation is reproduced in appendix b for the convenience of readers .    the @xmath29 fourier component of the induced current density is given in eq.([eqn : b8x ] ) , or in an integral form as @xmath83 where the integral kernel is the nonlocal susceptibility of the form @xmath84\\ ] ] and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are defined in eq.([eqn : bar - gh ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath87 is the @xmath0 independent part of generalized current density ( [ eqn : b5x ] ) .",
    "the induced current density ( [ eqn : b8x ] ) is a linear combination of the factors \\{@xmath88 } , defined in eq.([eqn : facf ] ) , and the factors \\{@xmath88 } are determined by vector potential .",
    "the selfconsistent solution of the coupled equations for current density and vector potential goes as follows .",
    "using eq.([eqn : b8x ] ) as the source term of eq.([eqn : m - eqs - i ] ) , we can solve the m - eq . and obtain @xmath89 as a linear combination of @xmath90 . substituting this solution in the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eqn : facf ] ) , we obtain a set of simultaneous linear equations of @xmath90 , the solution of which determines selfconsistent @xmath0 and @xmath82 ( in the region inside the matter ) .",
    "once we have the selfconsistent @xmath0 , we can use it to calculate @xmath91 via eq.([eqn : b8x ] ) , and @xmath0 at any point , e.g. , response field outside a sample . in this way the simultaneous equations of \\{@xmath88 } lead to all the information about the induced field and current density .",
    "this is the main framework of microscopic nonlocal response theory mentioned in sec.1 .",
    "the nonlocality of the susceptibility is the characteristic feature of this theory . within the extension of the relevant wave functions , an em field applied at a microscopic point",
    "@xmath92 can induce current density at different position @xmath93 .",
    "mathematically , the separable character of the integral kernel ( susceptibility ) plays an essential role to make this nonlocal scheme feasible in various manipulations , including the process of lwa to be discussed below .",
    "another distinction from the macroscopic m - eqs .",
    "is the boundary conditions of em field . to obtain the em response in this microscopic scheme of nonlocal response , we do not need to consider the boundary conditions for em field .",
    "( boundary conditions are already used to solve the eigenstates of matter , which determine the nonlocal susceptibility . )",
    "unique solution of the equations for \\{@xmath94 } is obtained only by requesting a given initial condition of em field , i.e. , incident field .",
    "this way of solution is in sharp contrast with the conventional macroscopic m - eqs . , which need the boundary conditions for em fields .",
    "the various new features in microscopic response theory , suitable for the study of nanostructures in particular , are discussed in @xcite .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the logically straightforward , reliable way of macroscopic averaging is to apply lwa to the microscopic response described in the previous subsection .",
    "the validity condition of lwa depends on the system in consideration , so that it must be checked independently for each system .",
    "( see sec.3.5 for more details . ) in this section , we discuss the genaral form of the macroscopic m - eqs . , assuming lwa as a good approximation .",
    "if lwa is valid , the spatial variation of vector potential @xmath89 and induced current density @xmath95 will be weak in comparison with that of the matrix elements of the current density .",
    "thus , the variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are represented by their long wavelength components alone .",
    "the form of m - eqs . for @xmath0 , eq.([eqn : m - eqs - i ] ) , is kept unaltered under lwa . in the fourier representation",

    "this is the general susceptibility of the present macroscopic scheme , and is the only susceptibility required to determine the complete ( linear ) response .",
    "though this expression contains the both t and l components of @xmath122 , only the t components are required for the selfconsistent solution with eq.([eqn : m - eqsf ] ) .",
    "it contains the contributions from both electric ( e1 ) and magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions , together with their mixing terms .",
    "it should be noted that the mixing terms remain nonvanishing in the case of chiral symmetry , where each excited state @xmath123 is active to both e1 and m1 transitions . in this case",
    ", we can not properly define @xmath41 and @xmath37 , or @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the absence of chiral symmetry , on the other hand , e1 and m1 characters are not mixed , so that the k - linear terms vanish , and the susceptibility turns out to be a sum of e1 and m1 types of terms .",
    "this is the situation where we can use @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and only in this case , the dispersion equation of the present formulation coincides with the conventional one in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as will be discussed below in more detail .",

    "there is a different approach to macroscopic m - eqs . by nelson @xcite , where he applies lwa to the lagrangian of matter - em field system ,",
    "rewriting it into a `` continuum '' lagrangian .",
    "the explicit use of lwa in the mathematical treatment is a common feature to the present theory , but the physical meaning is quite different . by the application of lwa to lagrangian , the dynamics of matter is described only by the long wavelength ( lw ) components , i.e. , the lw eigen modes of matter such as acoustic and optical phonons and excitons .",
    "thus the only contribution to susceptibility is made from the lw modes of matter , i.e. the susceptibility has poles only at the frequencies of these lw modes .",
    "since all the dynamical variables of short wavelength components are eliminated by the lwa of lagrangian , there is no chance for localized eigen states of the matter to contribute to susceptibility .",
    "when we consider a problem , for example , of changing the refractive index of a material by adding impurities , the main change is caused by the localized excitations at the impurities .",
    "but they can not be taken into account in nelson s treatment , because they are not lw modes of matter .",
    "in contrast , our approach based on the lwa of microscopic constitutive equation takes all the contributions of the eigen modes of matter according to their weights in lwa , i.e. , oscillator strengths .",
    "thus , our approach provides continuous relationship between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of em response , including the method to evaluate the validity condition of lwa ( see sec.3.5 ) .",
    "chirality or gyrotropy of a system appears as the rotation of polarization plane @xcite and as the mixing effect between electric and magnetic dipole characters , e.g. , of the excitons in cds @xcite and the coupled `` landau level - spin flip '' transitions in gaas @xcite , and the jones effect in atomic spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "it arises from the interference of electric and magnetic polarizations",
    ". the description could be either microscopic @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or macroscopic @xcite , depending on the problems .",
    "the microscopic one is equivalent to the microscopic nonlocal response in sec.2.2 , and as macroscopic one we have two schemes , the present one in sec.2.3 and 2.4 , and that of dbf eqs .",
    "@xcite .    in this subsection , we want to show that the two macroscopic schemes can not be equivalent . for this purpose",
    ", we use the dispersion relations . in our scheme , the dispersion relation is given as eq.([eqn : disp - cd ] ) , where the terms in the determinant other than @xmath167 is a sum of single poles except for @xmath168 .",
    "this is a general aspect of linear response .",
    "the dispersion equation for dbf eqs . is obtained by solving the m - eqs . @xmath169 and dbf constitutive eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : dbf ] ) .",
    "the condition for the existence of finite amplitude solution of the coupled linear equations for @xmath40 and @xmath170 gives the dispersion relation .",
    "in the simplified case where @xmath171 are scalars ( with @xmath29 dependece ) , the dispersion equation is given as @xmath172 this is obviously different from the equation ( [ eqn : disp - cd ] ) with respect to their pole structure on the r.h.s .",
    "since e1 and m1 characters of matter excitations are mixed in chiral materials , the successful trick in sec.2.4 to divide @xmath39 into @xmath41 and @xmath33 for achiral materials fails in this case .",
    "it is hopeless to rewrite @xmath39 as a sum of e1 , m1 , and chiral components in accordance with dbf eqs . , and to make the r.h.s . of eq.([eqn :",
    "chiraldisp ] ) a sum of single poles .",
    "this means that the dbf eqs . can not be justified from a microscopic basis .",
    "though the parameter @xmath173 can qualitatively describes the different phase velocities of right and left circularly polarized lights , we can not obtain its quantum mechanical expression consistent with @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the use of the k - linear term of @xmath39 is preferable to take care of the chirality , rather than the dbf eqs .",
    "according to the results of the previous section , veselago s definition of lhm ( @xmath38 ) @xcite needs to be revised because of the limited condition to allow the use of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a more general definition would be `` the occurrence of a dispersion branch with @xmath174 '' , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 are phase and group velocities , respectively .",
    "the part of positive @xmath177 in the negative @xmath97 region is important because the plane wave on this part of the branch should be connected to the incident em field via the boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "when two ( or more ) plane waves exist in the medium at the frequency of an incident wave , the general criterion for the correct choice of the branch is that the connected wave in the medium should not diverge as the size of matter becomes larger . from a general consideration of the dispersion curves in the complex ( @xmath178 ) plane @xcite",
    ", it is concluded that the choice of the branch with positive @xmath177 meets this criterion .",
    "physically , this means a simple fact that the plane wave with postive @xmath177 deays in the direction of its propagation .",
    "therefore , it applies to any dispersion curves of either right- or left - handed character .",
    "lhm can be made of either chiral or achiral materials .",

    ", we give a measurable example below .",
    "a typical lhm behavior is expected in an achiral material when a magnetic transition occurs in the frequency region where @xmath180 .",

    "are negative .",
    "the reflection coefficient of a semi - infinite system for normal incidence is given as @xmath186 for a medium of lhm , with @xmath187 .    .",
    "the parameter values @xmath188 and @xmath189 are used .",
    "the abscissa ( k ) and ordinate ( @xmath29 ) are normalized by @xmath190 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "two curves correspond to the cases ( a ) and ( b ) in the text .",
    "the forms of the curves are quite similar , except for their positions with respect to the resonant frequency @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , width=264 ]    dispersion curve and reflectivity spectrum are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 , respectively .",
    "we have a branch with @xmath191 as expected , and this branch opens a window ( a dip ) in the total reflection spectrum ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath185 along the dispersion curve changes continuously between 0 and @xmath193 , the dip of reflectivity can become as deep as 0 ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "the remarkable point is the relative position of @xmath26 with respect to the reflectivity dip . in ( a )",
    ", @xmath26 occurs on the lower frequency end of the window , and in ( b ) on the higher frequency end .",
    "this could be checked experimentally , via an appropriate model system , e.g. , a magnetic resonance of well - defined impurities overlapping with an e1 type phonon resonance .",
    ".,width=264 ]      in our derivation of the macroscopic m - eqs .",
    ", we have just assumed the validity of lwa for the system in consideration , and applied lwa to the microscopic response .",
    "the validity condition of lwa is not provided by the macroscopic theory itself , but must be checked independently through the microscopic scheme described in sec.2.2 , where all the wavelength components are included in the response field .",
    "only when the amplitudes of the short wavelength components are small enough in comperison with the lw component , lwa is a good approximation .    the validity condition of lwa is closely connected with the resonant or non - resonant condition of the optical process in question . in resonant optical processes , only a few excited states will be resonant to incident frequency , and they will make the main contribution to the induced current density .",
    "thus , the current density acquires a characteristic microscopic spatial structure reflecting the quantum mechanical wave functions of the resonant excited states .",
    "all the other non - resonant states make the contributions of more or less comparable amplitudes , so that their superposition will have no particular microscopic structure .",
    "therefore , non - resonant processes could generally be handled by macroscopic scheme , and resonant processes should mostly be treated by microscopic theory .",
    "however , the resonant processes due to uniformly distributed well - localized impurity or defect states may well be treated by the macroscopic theory , as long as one considers the average properties of these localized states .    in the case of resonant optical processes in confined systems ,",
    "the breakdown of lwa can occur rather quickly as we increase the size of confinement starting from an atomic scale .",
    "( see sec.4.1 of @xcite . ) in this case , one should compare the confinement size , not with the wavelength of the resonant light in vacuum , but with that in matter which is shortened by the factor of background refractive index .",
    "the merit of the conventional macroscopic m - eqs . lies in the description of matter in terms of a few material parameters .",
    "namely , for each material , one assumes certain simplified forms of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and chiral admittance containing some parameters .",
    "thereby one could consider resonant as well as nonresonant behavior of matter , so that one can handle a wide variety of em responses .",
    "these parameter values can be determined from the comparison between the solution of the m - eqs . and certain appropriate experiments .    in this subsection , we discuss how far this kind of approach can be justifed from the results of this work .",
    "while the conventional approach uses three susceptibilities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and chiral admittance @xmath173 defined for different pairs of vector fields , our new result requires the use of a single susceptibility @xmath39 between @xmath122 and @xmath195 , which contains the three tensor terms of the order @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as @xmath196 each term on the r.h.s . , to be obtained from eq.([eqn : chi - em ] ) , consists of a summation over excited states @xmath121 , which could be simplified as a constant ( plus a few resonant terms ) .",
    "this will reduce the number of freedom , facilitating the analysis of experimental results .",
    "whether or not the parameters in the simplified expressions can be treated as `` free '' should be judged from the original expressions . in chiral materials , for example , e1 and m1 transitions mix each other , so that all the three terms have common single poles . therefore ,",
    "if one keeps a pole in the simplification process , one should keep it for all of @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199",
    ".    it would generally be safe to use @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 with common resonances .",
    "especially , the models of lhm without inversion symmetry such as split ring resonators would generally need such a treatment . only in nonchiral materials we can use `` @xmath4 and @xmath5 '' with free parameters .",
    "but we should still be careful in ascribing a magnetic transition energy , not to the pole , but to the zero of @xmath5 .",
    "the main points of our logical steps and important results are as follows .    1 .",
    "the derivation of the conventional macroscopic m - eqs . from microscopic basis is not complete because of the lack of uniqueness in dividing current density into the components arising from electric and magnetic polarizations , and of the apparent inconsistency with microscopic response about the number of constitutive equations .",
    "2 .   as a new method of macroscopic averaging",
    ", we apply lwa to the microscopic nonlocal constitutive equation ( and the microscopic m - eqs . ) without any other assumption .",

    ", written in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath3 ( or @xmath0 and @xmath43 ) , which require only one susceptibility tensor @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   this susceptibility tensor contains the contribution from both elecrtic and magnetic polarizations , together with their mutual interference , which is in generl not separable into different components of conventional type .",
