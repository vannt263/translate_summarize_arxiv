    "many codes have been produced by the astronomical community , which address many different aspects related to the modelling of astrophysical phenomena .",
    "most of the time these codes are built as software packages , which can then be downloaded from the interested user on his / her own computing system and installed .",
    "sometimes these packages are packed as precompiled `` distributions '' , for specific architectures and/or operating systems , containing already binaries and executable files which , at the end of the installation process , are put in some convenient areas . in other cases ,",
    "the source codes are given , and instructions for compiling them on different systems are provided .",
    "anyhow , the final user is asked to install the software directly on a computer system available .",
    "+ on the other hand , the diffusion of html languages and of the related technologies have made feasible a different approach to code usage , where one does not need anymore to download and install locally large software packages .",
    "this approach makes use of _ portals _ ,",
    "i.e. some multifunction www interfaces , to allow remote users to prepare and execute some computational tasks on some predetermined platforms , where the user has been authorised to execute his / her jobs .",
    "the advantage is that the user is relieved from the duty of downloading and compiling the source code : the latter phase can sometimes be rather cumbersome , particularly to an unexperienced user .",
    "the obvious disadvantage of this approach is that the user has lesser control over the code he is using , particularly because he can operate very few ( if any ) changes on the source code . + usually , web portals for the astronomical community have been mostly designed and used to enable database searches . a complex extension of this concept , namely the astrophysical virtual observatory ( avo , http://www.euro-vo.org/ ) is currently under active development as a joint , large - scale effort involving few international institutions .",
    "the project presente here , astrocomp ( http://www.astrocomp.it ) , is a portal specifically designed to allow the access to _ simulation _ codes , rather than pre - existing databases .",
    "the end user will be able to remotely prepare the simulation , after browsing among those existing on the specified platforms , perform the run , and finally retrieve the data , interactively operating with the portal .",
    "+ this paper introduces the portal , its main functionalities and gives a short description of the software presently available ( more codes can be added on request of the authors ) .",
    "section 2 contains a description of the portal , while in sect .",
    "3 an account of the languages and technologies used to build the portal is present .",
    "4 describes characteristics of the numerical codes available , while sect .",
    "5 gives introductory info on the practical use of the facilities of the portal .",
    "finally , section 6 contains the conclusions .",
    "the astrocomp project is being developed by the inaf - astrophysical observatory of catania , the university of roma la sapienza and enea , funded by a consiglio nazionale delle ricerche ( cnr ) grant in the frame of the program ` agenzia 2000 ' .",
    "+ astrocomp is a portal ( http://www.astrocomp.it ) based on web technologies , aimed at managing and using codes for astrophysics , employing user - friendly interfaces ; at present , the codes available are , mainly , related to the simulation of gravitational systems of astrophysical and cosmological interest .",
    "the main functionality of the portal is a user - friendly application which allows the scientist to submit a job in a grid of computing systems . indeed , even if , at the moment , there is a direct link between the software and the system where the user job will run , the database architecture is not related to a specific system platform , and the connection with the system is made with several parameters that can be easily changed .",
    "+ at present , the computational platforms registered in astrocomp are the cineca ( casalecchio di reno , bologna , italy ; http://www.cineca.it ) mpp systems : ibm sp4 with 512 pes and ibm linux cluster with 512 pes through the formal agreement between inaf ( istituto nazionale di astrofisica ) and cineca , and the ibm sp system with 32 pes sited at the catania astrophysical observatory",
    ". registered astrocomp users can freely use them ( within the assigned time quota ) .",
    "astrocomp runs on apache - advanced extranet : this allows to set up connections with no practical limits on the number of authorized users .",
    "+ apache is a powerful , flexible , compliant web server , it has a flexible configuration and it is extensible to third - party modules . the access to the astroadmin section , i.e. the reserved area written for the administrator for authorization and authentication , is based on the apache facilities .",
    "dynamical web pages are realized with a server - side scripting php ( recursive acronym for `` php : hypertext preprocessor '' ) , a widely used open source general - purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded in html .",
    "the php programming language provides a powerful extension to html to create advanced and interactive web pages .",
    "+ astrocomp has a database of the software and of the systems and codes managed by the portal ; this is done with the mysql database management system .",
    "the database tables contain a description of the codes properties and of the hardware resources .",
    "the portal is designed with a relational database containing the information related to the hardware systems accessible to astrocomp , that is arranged such to ensure an easy implementation of new hpc resources .",
    "the astrocomp system administrator updates the hardware table and in particular fills the fields related to os commands : user login , directories , disk quota , job submission and job management etc .",
    "the administration of all the portal features is done through a reserved section .",
    "a new code can be quickly added to the portal and its behaviour can be controlled on the user - side .",
    "there are no practical limits to the variety of codes that can be included in the astrocomp structure .",
    "+ the portal architecture allows us to handle each code considering the i / o files , shell scripts , boundary condition data , log files , etc .",
    "a job is an entity described by a state : idle , queued or running and some other parameters .",
    "an astrocomp section allows the user to know the system status of an hpc giving updated information like memory and cpu usage .",
    "in the following sections we shortly describe the codes that are presently available in astrocomp .",
    "more exhaustive descriptions of these codes can be found in the portal .",
    "fly is a tree parallel code that follows the evolution of a newtonian three - dimensional n - body collisionless system .",
    "it is based on the tree barnes - hut algorithm ( ) and periodical boundary conditions are implemented by means of ewald s ( ) summation technique .",
    "the evolutive differential equations are integrated using the classical ( second order ) ` leap - frog ' integration scheme with a fixed time - step .",
    "all the particles have assigned the same mass , and the spatial cubic grid has fixed size .",
    "the supported cosmological models are : standard cold dark matter @xmath0 , lambda models ( with cold dark matter ) , and open models @xmath1 .",
    "+ the code was originally developed on a cray t3e system using the logically shared memory access routines ( shmem ) but it also runs on sgi origin systems and on ibm sp by using low - level application programming interface routines ( lapi ) .",
    "fly is included in the cpc ( computer physics communications ) program library .",
    "more details can be found in and at http://www.ct.astro.it / fly/.      atd ( adaptive tree decomposition tree - code ) is a parallel n - body code for the simulations of the dynamics of collisonal and collisionless boundary - free self - gravitating stellar systems .",
    "the gravitational interaction among the ` particles ' is computed with an algorithm based on the barnes & hut scheme ( ) including up to the quadrupole moment in the multipolar expansion .",
    "a ` dynamical ' tree reconstruction is also implemented in the code .",
    "this permits a more frequent update of the small  scale ( neighbouring ) interactions ( evaluated by direct summation ) in respect to the large  scale forces , without the need of a complete reconstruction of the whole data tree  structure .",
    "the time integration of the trajectories of the particles representing stars in the numerical model , is performed using individual and variable time - steps in a ` leap - frog ' algorithm corrected in such a way to preserve 2@xmath2 order accuracy also during the time - step change .",
    "the code has been parallelized adopting an original scheme for the distribution of the computational work among processors called ` adaptivetree decomposition ' ( interested readers can find an exhaustive description of this scheme in ) .",
    "we carried out two different parallel versions of the code which can run both on shared memomy platforms ( using openmp language directives ) and on distributed memory computers ( employing suitable mpi calls ) .",
    "further details on the code features and its usage can be found in the portal itself .",
    "mara is an mpi code for modelling sequences of light curves of single and binary stars with surface brightness inhomogeneities , in particular cool spots .",
    "it allows to derive sequences of maps of the spot surface distribution which are useful to study magnetic solar - like activity in close binaries and single stars .",
    "moreover , it allows to determine the best set of photometric parameters for a close active binary by correcting the systematic errors due to the light curve distortion induced by spots (; ) .",
    "anyone interested in using the facilities provided by astrocomp has to register , first . the steps to do are :    1 .",
    "register as a new user by clicking on the registration form button on the left - hand side of the home - page ; 2 .",
    "fill in carefully the form and submit it ; 3 .",
    "wait for a confirmation e - mail sent by the portal administrator .",
    "the scientific staff will evaluate the request and assign the access to the portal services according to three different ` user classes ' : a , b and c. the a class has the highest limit on the cpu time and disk usage ; the b class supplies the user with a limited amount of cpu time and disk quota . while the c class assigns only few resources to execute very short jobs .",
    "clicking on the user area button , any registered user can have the access to all the computational facilities of astrocomp , after the normal login procedure . at present",
    ", the astrocomp user is allowed to :    * start a new simulation by choosing the code to used and by determining the simulation parameters via the parameters on - line form ( initial conditions can also be uploaded by the local user s host to the server ) ; * choose among different platforms in the pool of the available resources of astrocomp , taking into account the work - load and the accessibility of each system ;    or    * browse the status of a previously launched job , possibly checking the intermediate results with a preliminary ` on - the - fly ' visualization tool already available in the portal ; * download the final and/or intermediate results .",
    "moreover , anyone who visits the portal without being , necessarily , a registered user can also examine all the implemented software clicking on the software button on the home - page ( http://www.astrocomp.it/software ) , read the enclosed documentations and manuals , and take a look at the features and the status of all the computing machines that can be employed clicking on hardware .",
    "( http://www.astrocomp.it/user/hardware )    the user chooses the system where the job will be submitted , then he fills in some forms specifying the parameters and all the variables involved in the job .",
    "the complete job history is stored in a mysql table .",
    "the user can also easily retrieve the parameter collection and can re - use them for a new job submission .",
    "+ the last phase consists in the job preparation and submission it is the portal itself that copies and/or uploads to the remote system , all the needed files and shell scripts and compiles and submits the code . in the next future the grid environement will allow the user to register and store the output files in a storage element ( e.g. datagrid environment , see http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/ ) .",
    "the aim of astrocomp ( http://www.astrocomp.it ) is to run astrophysical codes on a grid of systems , avoiding the effort to learn new specific operating system and/or parallelization commands .",
    "even if , at present , astrocomp allows the execution on a limited set of systems , according to the design of the portal and its future development we foresee to execute astrocomp on an effective computational grid .",
    "cineca ( http://www.cineca.it ) has already selected this project as a pilot project for internal mpp grid usage .",
    "a formal agreement between the italian national institute of nuclear physics ( infn ) and the inaf - astrophysical observatory of catania allows us to build a local datagrid node at the inaf site .",
    "astrocomp will also be ported to the datagrid in the next future .",
