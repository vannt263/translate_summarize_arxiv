    "einstein s general theory of relativity is the foundation of our modern description of gravitational phenomena , ranging from stellar evolution and planetary dynamics to the evolution of the universe itself .",
    "however over the years it has become clear that in order for this theory to explain observations on galactic and cosmological scales it seems necessary to assume a universe dominated by dark energy and dark matter , neither of which can be explained within the standard model of particle physics .",
    "this has led to a resurgence of interest in modified theories of gravity , in the hope that they might help explain the observed universe @xcite . in this paper",
    "we look at one class of such models where an additional scalar degree of freedom is included in the gravitational sector , and the dynamics is governed by the action , where the metric signature is chosen to be mostly positive .",
    "align s=&d^4x + + & _",
    "md^4x  ,  _ = b()g _ [ action ]    these models differ from quintessence models by the presence of the conformal coupling to matter @xmath0 , which gives rise to an effective potential dependent on the matter distribution .",
    "the conformal coupling , which is expected to be of gravitational strength , gives rise to an additional fifth force , whose existence has been heavily constrained by local tests on deviations from the inverse square law , casimir forces and violations of the weak equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "these constraints rule out most such models for natural values of the couplings , unless the fifth forces can be screened in high density regions where the constraints are most stringent .",
    "models exhibiting such screening are often called screened modified gravity , where the chameleon @xcite , symmetron @xcite and galileon models @xcite are examples . in the chameleon model ,",
    "the mass of the field depends on the local matter density in such a way that in high density regions , like on earth or in the solar system , it becomes large , leading to a yukawa like suppression of the fifth force range . in low density regions on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of the chameleon is small allowing long range fifth forces which can modify the predictions of gr on cosmological scales .",
    "in addition to the yukawa screening , the chameleon model gives rise to additional screening through the so called thin - shell mechanism which restricts the fifth forces of objects like the sun and earth , to thin shells close to the surface @xcite .",
    "usually the effects of the new scalar degree of freedom is studied in the static or quasi - static limit .",
    "however , there is increasing interest in the possibility that scalar waves may yield non - negligible corrections to gr and have to be taken into account when making predictions for some of these theories . recently n - body simulations taking into account the full dynamical equations of motion for the symmetron model where performed @xcite , showing novel phenomena such as the creation of domain walls and their subsequent breakdown leading to energy release in the form of scalar waves .",
    "non - static effects were also studied in the linear and non - linear regime in different models in @xcite .",
    "the waves appearing in the symmetron model where shown to travel at the speed of light in accordance with the notion that the speed of sound equals the speed of light , @xmath1 , for scalar fields with canonical kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "however from the field theoretic point of view , at least in the linear regime , waves in a massive scalar field originating from a localized source travel with the group velocity @xmath2 @xcite , contrary to the phase velocity of plane waves in the fourier expansion , which travel travel at phase velocities larger than that of light , @xmath3 .",
    "a similar thing happens when light travels through dispersive media , where the phase velocity can be larger than the speed of light in vacuum , but where the group velocity and the measured speed of light is smaller than the vacuum value .",
    "this stems from the fact that waves having a local origin are not described by a single plane wave mode , but rather by a distribution of modes or a wave packet , which collectively travel at the group velocity .",
    "these differences between the speed of propagation of light and the gravitational degrees of freedom may lead to observational consequences . see for instance @xcite for some of the consequences of having different horizons for light and gravity .",
    "the concept of group velocity is seldom mentioned in the literature on scalar field cosmology , and there seems to be some confusion as to the meaning of the different concepts of velocity ( sound speed @xmath4 , group velocity @xmath5 and phase velocity @xmath6 ) . in this paper we review the relation between these concepts in the context of linear scalar waves , and investigate how these results carry over into the non - linear regime and curved spacetime using numerics . as an explicit example we look at the chameleon model , where we throughout assume that the non - minimal coupling in equation   can be linearized ,",
    "@xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "this allows us to linearize the matter coupling    equation _ m(_,)_m(g_,)+b()t^m [ linear_mass ]    where @xmath9 is the trace of the einstein frame stress - energy tensor @xmath10 in the absence of scalar couplings @xmath11 for the conformal coupling @xmath0 and potential @xmath12 we follow  @xcite :    equation [ chamcoup ] v()=m^4()^n  ,  b()=e^21 + 2    which gives the equation of motion for the scalar field    equation [ eq : full_ceom ] _ ^=s(,t^m)=v()_,-b()_,t^m .    throughout this paper",
    "we focus on perturbations in the scalar field induced by a matter source rather than how matter perturbations are affected by the presence of additional gravitational degrees of freedom . for modifications to the evolution and dynamics of ordinary matter perturbations in modified theories of gravity ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : scalarwaves : linreg ] we look at the propagation of scalar waves in the linear regime and minkowski spacetime .",
    "we then continue in section  [ sec : scalarwaves : nonlinreg ] by looking at how this behaviour is modified when the non - linearities are taken into account .",
    "this is followed by a brief discussion in section  [ sec : speedofsound ] on the apparent inconsistency between the group velocity , @xmath13 , determining the propagation speed of the scalar waves , and the effective speed of sound @xmath1 found in the fluid approach used in perturbation theory .",
    "finally we summarize and conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we start by considering the simplest possible scenario , where we assume a minkowski background , with non - relativistic matter @xmath14 .",
    "the matter distribution can then be split into a background and source part , @xmath15 where we allow the background to potentially vary in both space and time ( e.g. as a time varying cosmological background , or the static background solution for spherical source ) .",
    "this can be used to consider linear perturbations over potentially non - linear backgrounds , although this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we can then write the field in terms of a background solution @xmath16 and a perturbation @xmath17 , @xmath18 which allows us to taylor expand the source term @xmath19 in equation    equation s_s(_0,-_0)++    using this approximation , the equations of motion for the perturbations @xmath17 becomes    equation [ eq : pert_ceom ] ( _ ^-m^2)=  ,  m^2=  ,    where @xmath20 is the solution to the full equations for the background density @xmath21 , and the approximation is valid as long as @xmath22 . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to a fixed matter background with the background field @xmath16 situated at the minima of the background potential .",
    "this yields the standard massive klein - gordon equation with the background field @xmath16 given by    align _",
    "0&=()^1/(n+1 ) + m^2&=(n+1 )    from the expression for @xmath16 we can now estimate what densities justifies the linearization of the conformal coupling    equation _ 0 < <  ,  _ 0>>2nm^4(nm)^n    if we assume natural values for the coupling parameters @xmath23  @xcite , with @xmath24 being the vacuum energy density , then the ratio @xmath25 and the approximation is valid for matter densities @xmath26 , which covers most conceivable situations , for @xmath27 .",
    "first we note that even though the plane wave solutions of equation can travel at speeds exceeding that of light , the propagation of a signal originating from a localized source is always causal .",
    "this can be seen by considering the effect of a source on the future field where we can write the solution in terms of the retarded greens function @xmath28 @xcite , defined in terms of the fundamental equation for the future field .",
    "gather ( _ ^-m^2)g_ret(x^,x^)=^4(x^-x^ ) + = t - t  ,  = ^2-|-|^2 + g_ret(x^,x^)=-(()- ) [ eq : greens ]    here @xmath29 are the bessel functions of the first kind and @xmath30 is the heaviside step - function @xmath31 defines the boundary of the future light cone of the source and we see that outside the light cone , @xmath32 , the greens function vanishes . the particular solution @xmath17 for an arbitrary source @xmath33 can now be constructed by exploiting the linearity of the equation , which allows us to write @xmath17 as a weighted superposition of greens solutions for different @xmath34-sources    align [ eq : linint ] = ( x^)g_ret(x^,x^)d^4x    it follows from this form of the solution , that the field at a spacetime point @xmath35 is only affected by the part of the source inside the past light cone of the spacetime point .",
    "this ensures that the propagation of perturbations caused by a localized source is causal and the upper limit for the propagation velocity is the speed of light @xmath36 . as an example we consider the case of a point particle of unit mass created at the origin at @xmath37 , which we model as a delta - source @xmath38 . where assume that the scalar field is initially unperturbed @xmath39 .",
    "the integral form of the solution in terms of the distance from the source @xmath40 then simplifies to    align [ eq : linint_particle ] ( t , r)=-(1-mr^u_f_0 )  ,    where @xmath41 . in the infinite future the integral simplifies for finite values of @xmath40 to the standard yukawa solution for a static @xmath34-source , where the negative sign of the solution is a manifestation of the force between equal charges , given by the gradient of the field @xmath42 .",

    "a closed form solution is difficult , but numerical solutions can be found either by solving the integral equation or the differential equation .",
    "figure [ fig : staticdeltasource ] shows the solutions at time @xmath44 for a scalar field with mass @xmath45 , obtained using a 4th order runge - kutta solver for eq . and an adaptive gauss - konrod quadrature integral solver @xcite for eq .",
    "the light horizon is indicated by the vertical black line at @xmath46 after which no perturbations occur in accordance with the vanishing of the greens function beyond this point .     in the scalar field at @xmath44 induced by a static delta source created at the origin at @xmath37 .",
    "the dashed blue and red lines corresponds to the solutions found by solving the differential and integral equations respectively .",
    "the black vertical line indicates the light horizon , while the dashed black line corresponds to the static yukawa solution .",
    "the length scale is arbitrary and related to the time scale by the speed of light @xmath36.,width=340 ]    the sudden introduction of a particle at @xmath37 creates oscillations in the scalar field which gradually subsides as the associated energy is radiated away .",
    "this leads to a wave pattern outside the source where the perturbations are large and narrow at the wavefront and gradually decay and widen in its wake as the central oscillations decay .",
    "as the oscillations decay the solution converges towards the yukawa solutions as predicted by the analytic solution . in the linear regime",
    "the perturbations in the field are proportional to the size of the matter perturbations and grows without bound as illustrated by the yukawa solution .",
    "this is not necessarily true in the non - linear regime , and for chameleon models studied here , the self - coupling diverges as @xmath47 goes to zero , leading to a positive definite magnitude of the field .",
    "this results in a suppression of the scalar wave amplitude in the non - linear regime , due to smaller gradients in the field .",
    "the solutions found using the runge - kutta solver agrees well with the integral solutions , and serves as a sanity check for the differential solver that will be used for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the concepts of phase and group velocity relates to the propagation of plane waves and wave packets respectively .",

    "k=0 + &  = [ eq : disprel ]    the resulting relation between the frequency @xmath50 and the wave vector @xmath51 is called the dispersion relation and tells us how the solutions to the equation propagate and disperse .",
    "the dispersion relation allows us to write the spacetime fourier modes in terms of spatial ones @xmath52 and write equation as    equation ( t,)=_e^-ik(c_pt-)d^3 [ eq : f_modes ]    where the wave vector is written in terms of its magnitude and directional unit vector @xmath53 .",
    "equation tells us that the plane waves modes in the fourier expansion travels with a velocity @xmath6 , called the phase velocity .",
    "equation c_p==>1    however the phase velocity describes the propagation of plane waves which are not localized , and hence different from the waves originating from a source .",
    "this is why the phase velocity can be greater than the speed of light , without breaking causality .",
    "a wave produced by a local source consists of a collection of plane waves , usually referred to as a wave packet , which never exceed the speed of light , as discussed in section [ sec : linearcausal ] .",
    "if the wave has a well defined wavelength @xmath54 , the propagation velocity can be estimated by considering solutions with @xmath55 sharply peaked around a wavenumber @xmath56 . for simplicity",

    "though we have shown it here only for a gaussian initial distribution , a similar behavior applies to more general distributions .",
    "we now continue by solving the full non - linear equations numerically to see how the non - linearities affect the propagation of waves that originate from a harmonically oscillating source .",
    "again we consider a gaussian source @xmath33 embedded in a homogeneous background @xmath83 , where we denote the associated background value for the field by @xmath16 .",

    "none of these conditions are satisfied for the simple static background approximation we have employed in studying the propagation of perturbations in the field . in addition , as already mentioned the speed of sound is defined with respect to the rest frame of the scalar fluid , which is a natural reference frame when the only degrees of freedom are the metric and the scalar field , but not when considering scalar waves induced by a matter source , where the natural frame is the matter rest frame . in this frame",
    "the scalar fluid has a non - vanishing four velocity and hence the flow of energy and momentum is different from that of the scalar field reference frame .",
    "for example the energy density @xmath88 as seen by an observer moving with a four velocity @xmath89 relative to the scalar fluid is given by    equation _",
    "= t_u^u^    which means that in the matter rest frame energy propagates as a combination of sound waves with respect to the fluid rest frame and through the flow of the fluid itself .",
    "in fact in @xcite , they consider a classical scalar field coupled to gravity and find an effective speed of sound    equation c_s^2=    this is similar to the limiting spread velocity @xmath90 for a gaussian distribution discussed in section  [ sec : linearcausal ] , since the spread of a gaussian in real space is the inverse of the spread in fourier space , @xmath91 .",
    "much more detailed accounts regarding the correspondence between a perfect fluid and a scalar field can be found in the literature ( see f.ex @xcite ) , we simply note that the speed of sound appearing in the fluid description and the group velocity associated with the propagation of scalar waves are different concepts and should not be confused .",
    "we have looked at the propagation of scalar waves induced by matter sources in the context of modified theories of gravity which include screening mechanisms . the usual approach when studying these theories in the non - linear regime of cosmological perturbations",
    "is based on the assumption that scalar waves travel at the speed of light . within the context of standard gravity",
    ", it has been shown that in this case the speed can be approximated by infinity without loss of accuracy in the estimation of observables @xcite . however , there is no study within modified gravity that supports this idea .",
    "here we review the concepts of phase and group velocity in the context of modified gravity and find that mass terms and non - linearities in the equations of motion can lead to propagation and dispersion velocities significantly different from the speed of light , contrary to usual beliefs .",
    "the origin of the assumption of light like propagation for the additional scalar degree of freedom seems to originate from the speed of sound being equal to the speed of light in the perfect fluid approximation of the scalar field often used in cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "we point out that the necessary conditions for this approximation to be valid breaks down when considering scalar waves induced by matter sources , and that the propagation of these waves is best described by the group velocity . as the group velocity is the one associated with the propagation of signals , a reduction of its value will have direct impact on the behavior of these theories .    on cosmological scales , the background matter density and perturbations",
    "are small and slowly varying . for the class of models studied in this paper ,",
    "the scalar becomes very light and the large scale perturbations in the field will be linear for reasonable choices of model parameters .",
    "we therefore expect the assumption of light like propagation to be valid in this regime .",
    "we stress that this expectation only applies to models whose equation of motion reduces to the klein gordon equation ( [ eq : pert_ceom ] ) in the linear regime , and does not extend to , for instance , models with non - canonical kinetic terms .",
    "on the other hand , the internal dynamics of galaxies and satellites submerged in large dark matter halos could be affected by the fact that the group velocity is small . in these cases",
    ", it will be necessary to take into account the fact that different parts of a galaxy will see changes in the environment at different times ( i.e. a full non - static analysis should be made ) .",
    "full 3d high - resolution simulations are required to measure the impact of this phenomenon in more realistic scenarios .",
    "furthermore we consider a possible link between gravitational clustering of canonical scalar fields and the dispersion rate of perturbations in the field .",
    "we find that this rate is closely related to the speed of sound related to the time averaged energy density and pressure of spatially localized scalar perturbations . in order to establish whether this spread velocity is directly related to the jeans length of the field",
    "requires the inclusion of gravitational effects on the perturbations which was beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , we found that non - linear terms in the equations of motion for the scalar field induce small scale oscillations superimposed on the main waves generated by the source .",
    "furthermore these non - linearities can reduce the amplitude of the oscillations compared to the linear case . despite this",
    "we find that the propagation speed of the main waves is still described by the group velocity .",
    "this constitutes a characteristic signature of modified gravity which could be potentially observed with future gravitational waves experiments ( e.g. lisa ) .",
    "it is important to note that this observable is not degenerate with other effects .",
    "this differentiates it from other observables such as the power spectrum of cosmological density perturbations , for which the modified gravity signals are degenerated with the effects of baryons and neutrinos .",
    "targeted studies on specific astrophysical objects should be made to predict the amplitude of these waves under realistic situations .",
    "our study is focused on a particular set of models where the matter coupling is conformal , but considering that models with more exotic matter couplings usually lead to considerable reductions in the speed of sound already in the perfect fluid approximation , the results are expected to be more general .",
    "more studies are required before having a complete picture of the problem and the validity of small scale cosmological simulations .",
    "while the results found in this paper seem to constitute a problem for the community of simulations , we should look at the bright side and keep in mind that this new effect could lead to a completely new set of observables that can be used to test these theories for gravity .",
