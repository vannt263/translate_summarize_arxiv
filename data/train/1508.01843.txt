    "electronic nicotine delivery systems , or e - cigs , have become a popular alternative to traditional tobacco products .",
    "the vaporization technology present in e - cigarettes allows consumers to simulate tobacco smoking without igniting the carcinogens found in tobacco @xcite .",
    "survey methods have revealed widespread awareness of e - cigarette products @xcite .",
    "the health risks @xcite , marketing regulations @xcite , and the potential of these devices as a form of nicotine replacement therapy @xcite are hotly debated politically @xcite and investigated clinically @xcite .",
    "the cdc reports that more people in the us are addicted to nicotine than any other drug and that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin , cocaine , and alcohol @xcite .",
    "nicotine addiction is extremely difficult to quit , often requiring more than one attempt @xcite , however nearly 70% of smokers in the us want to quit @xcite . data mining can provide valuable insight into marketing strategies , varieties of e - cigarette brands , and their use by consumers @xcite .",
    "twitter , a mainstream social media outlet comprising over 230 million active accounts , provides a means to survey the popularity and sentiment of consumer opinions regarding e - cigarettes over time .",
    "individuals post tweets which are short text based messages restricted to 140 characters . using data mining techniques , roughly @xmath0 tweets containing mentions of e - cigarettes were collected from a 10% sample of twitter s garden hose feed spanning from january 2012 though december 2014 .",
    "this analysis extends a preliminary study @xcite which analyzed all e - cigarette related tweets spanning may through june 2012 .",
    "as twitter has become a mainstream social media outlet , it has become increasingly enticing for third parties to gamify the system by creating self - tweeting automated software to send messages to organic ( human ) accounts as a means for personal gain and for influence manipulation @xcite .",
    "we recently introduced a classification algorithm that is based upon three linguistic attributes of an individual s tweets @xcite .",
    "the algorithm analyzes the average hyperlink ( url ) count per tweet , the average pairwise dissimilarity between an individual s tweets , and the unique word introduction decay rate of an individual s tweets .",
    "all tweets mentioning e - cigarettes were categorized using a two - tier classification process .",
    "tweets containing an abundance of marketing slang ( ` free trial ' , ` starter kit ' , ` coupon ' ) are immediately categorized as automated .",
    "all of the tweets from individuals that have mentioned an e - cigarette keyword are collected in order to classify the remaining tweets per individual as either organic or automated .",
    "the machine learning classifier was trained on the natural linguistic cues from human accounts to identify promotional and spam entities by exclusion .",
    "the manipulative effects , agendas , and ecosystem of generalized social media marketing campaigns have been identified and extensively studied @xcite .",
    "other work , @xcite , has distinguished between purely automated accounts , or  robots \" , and human assisted automated accounts referred to as  cyborgs \" . on twitter , these campaigns have also been characterized using markov random fields to classify accounts as either promotional or organic @xcite .",
    "this study was able to achieve very high classification accuracy , but was working under a much shorter time frame ( 1 month ) and was trained on all relevant tweets authored within this time window .",
    "our study compiled a 10% sample of tweets over a three - year period , so we relied on a classifier that was trained on smaller samples of tweets per individual .",
    "the emotionally charged words that contribute to the positivity of various subsets of tweets from each category were quantitatively measured using hedonometrics @xcite .",
    "outliers in both the positivity and frequency time - series distributions correspond to political debates regarding the regulation of e - cigarettes .",
    "recent studies@xcite report an alarmingly rapid increase in the youth awareness and consumption of electronic cigarettes ; a michigan study found that the use of e - cigarettes surpass tobacco cigarettes among teens @xcite .",
    "the cdc reports that  the number of never - smoking youth increased three - fold from approximately 79,000 in 2011 to 263,000 in 2013 \" @xcite . during this time - period",
    "there has also been a substantial ( 256% ) increase in youth exposure to electronic cigarette television marketing campaigns @xcite .",
    "due to the high youth presence on twitter @xcite as well as the clinical uncertainty regarding the risks associated with e - cigarettes , understanding the effect of promotionally marketing vaporization products across social media should be immediately relevant to public health and policy makers .",
    "an exhaustive search from the 10%  garden hose \" random sample of twitter spanning 2012 through 2014 yielded approximately 850,000 tweets mentioning a keyword related to electronic cigarettes including : e(-)cig , e(-)cigarette , electronic cigarette , etc .",
    "all tweets were tokenized by removing punctuation and performing a case insensitive pattern match for keywords . using time zone meta - data the tweets were converted into their local post time , in order for a more accurate ordinal sentiment analysis .",
    "the language , reported by twitter , and user features were also collected and analyzed .      as reported in @xcite",
    "there is a high prevalence of automation among e - cigarette related tweets .",
    "many of these messages were promotional in nature , offering discounted or free samples or advertising specific electronic cigarette paraphernalia ( see table 3 ) . a human detection algorithm defined and tested in @xcite",
    "was implemented to classify accounts as either automated or organic ( human in nature ) .",
    "all tweets from each individual appearing in our dataset were collected for the classifier . for each individual , the average url count , average tweet dissimilarity , and word introduction decay rate were calculated for the individuals with at least 25 sampled tweets .",
    "the majority ( 94% ) of commercial e - cigarette tweets collected by @xcite contain a hyperlink ( url ) .",
    "the average url count per tweet has been demonstrated to be a strong feature for detecting robotic accounts @xcite .",
    "many algorithmically generated tweets contain similar structures with minor character replacements and long chains of common substrings , as opposed to organic content .",
    "the pairwise tweet dissimilarity of tweets @xmath1 from a particular individual was estimated by subtracting the length ( number of characters ) of the longest common subsequence , @xmath2 from the length of both tweets , @xmath3 and normalizing by the total length of both tweets : @xmath4    for example , given the two tweets : + @xmath5 = ( i love tweeting , i love spamming ) .",
    "then @xmath6 = 16 , @xmath7 = 15 , @xmath8 ( including whitespace ) and we calculate the pairwise tweet dissimilarity as : @xmath9    the average tweet dissimilarity of the individual was then estimated by finding the arithmetic mean of each individual s calculated pairwise tweet dissimilarity . since automated and promotional accounts have a structured and limited vocabulary , the unique word introduction decay rate introduced in @xcite serves as another useful attribute to detect automated accounts . using these attributes , the calibrated human detection algorithm , tested in @xcite , detected over 90% of automated accounts from a mixed 1000 user sample with less than a 5% false positive rate .",
    "the human detection algorithm was calibrated for a range of tweet sample sizes from hand classified organic accounts .",
    "ordinal samples of collected tweets from each account were binned into partitions of 25 ranging from 25 to a maximum of 500 tweets .",
    "table 1 below lists the number of automated and organic classified accounts per year .",
    "individuals with less than 25 sampled tweets were not classified with the detection algorithm ."
