    "an understanding of star formation is pivotal to understanding both the origin of galaxies and the origin of planetary systems .",
    "a crucial step in the formation of galaxies is the formation of stars .",
    "intensive archaeology of chemical abundances has uncovered the outline of the star formation history of our own galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and look - back studies are beginning to provide more direct information about star formation beyond @xmath6 .",
    "it now appears that the star formation rate was flat to @xmath7 @xcite or even increasing up the highest observed redshifts @xcite .",
    "at least half the extragalactic background light lies in the far - infrared to submillimeter region @xcite , suggesting that half the star formation in the history of the universe has occurred in dusty regions .",
    "submillimeter galaxies , at a mean @xmath8 @xcite , are forming stars at prodigious rates ( up to 1000 solar masses / year ) , in dusty , molecule - rich environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such objects have now been seen even at @xmath9 @xcite . to understand the nature of this process",
    ", we must develop a better understanding of massive star formation in similar environments more amenable to detailed study , the dense regions of molecular clouds in our galaxy .    in a similar way",
    ", the study of the origin of planetary systems rests on a deeper understanding of the role of disks in star formation .",
    "it is now clear that disks surround most young stars @xcite , and we are beginning to study the properties and evolution of these disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies are fundamental to understanding the frequency and variety of planetary systems that current searches are revealing ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    over the last two decades",
    ", we have made substantial progress in understanding how low - mass stars form in relative isolation .",
    "spurred by the elaboration of an elegant theoretical paradigm , beginning with @xcite and culminating in the influential review by @xcite , observers have developed the capability to test predictions of theoretical models .",
    "we have a `` standard model '' and a number of variations , each of which makes predictions that can be tested by observations .",
    "in particular , the form of the density and velocity field in the envelope around the forming protostar differs in the different models , and observers are beginning to be able to distinguish these observationally ( see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "studies of dust continuum emission with instruments like _ scuba _ is providing a valuable new probe of the density distribution , while molecular line profiles probe the kinematics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , predictions that disks would form on scales of @xmath10  au around forming stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been verified @xcite . in the study of low - mass , isolated star formation",
    ", theory has clearly revealed the path to the observers .",
    "however , most stars probably form not in isolation , but in clustered environments @xcite .",
    "massive stars seem to form exclusively in these environments , but the full spectrum of stars and sub - stellar objects forms in clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bursts of star formation seen in distant galaxies are clearly related to the formation of massive stars in clusters .",
    "consequently , understanding them is crucial to understanding galaxy formation .",
    "disks around forming stars have been seen in clustered environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but interactions among proximate star / disk systems may affect the mass distribution of these disks @xcite .    in the area of massive , clustered star formation ,",
    "extensive observations exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but theory is very underdeveloped .",
    "we know that the typical conditions in dense regions of high mass are quite different from those in dense regions of low mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the temperatures and densities are higher , and the masses of gas are sufficient to form many stars ( up to @xmath11 ) .",
    "the linewidths of molecular lines are much greater and deviate from the linewidth - size relations known from lower - mass regions and regions not forming stars @xcite .",
    "the overall density distribution in these high - mass regions seems well approximated by a power law @xmath12 , with exponent similar to that of low - mass regions ( @xmath13 ) @xcite but densities ( @xmath14 ) 100 times higher @xcite .",
    "these wide lines are highly supersonic , and turbulence must play a major role . some dense regions seem to be more fragmented @xcite , as might be expected if clusters are forming .    in these conditions ,",
    "direct extension of theories of low mass star formation may run into problems .",
    "recent work on the formation of massive stars delineates the theoretical framework @xcite of formation in turbulent dense regions .",
    "this work predicts the overall properties of the regions , but the details of the formation and its observational manifestations remain to be understood .",
    "the close proximity of other clumps within the overall dense region will perturb the density and velocity fields around a given clump , making the kinds of tests applied to isolated regions less meaningful ( and very difficult observationally ) .",
    "theories that make detailed predictions of observables are needed .",
    "statistical measures must be compared between theory and observation , rather than any specific realization of a simulation because stochasticity is inevitable .",
    "for example , the distribution of clump masses and velocities as a function of time could be predicted and compared to observations .",
    "if one can follow the process with sufficient dynamic range , the distribution of clump angular momenta could be used to predict things like the frequency of binaries and disks , if supplemented by more detailed calculations of the subsequent evolution of individual structures once they get small enough that their internal dynamical time becomes less than the interaction time .",
    "indeed , predictions of when that point occurs are needed .",
    "larger scale correlations can be studied , such as the tendency toward alignment of angular momentum vectors or magnetic fields .",
    "a number of simulations of the fragmentation of a molecular cloud to form a cluster have been performed ( e.g. , @xcite ; see the recent review articles by @xcite ) .",
    "two research groups have been particularly prominent in recent years .",
    "klessen , burkert , and their collaborators ( @xcite , hereafter collectively kb ; @xcite ) , have used a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code to follow the evolution of a region with many times the jeans mass .",
    "they were able to reproduce the observed distribution of clump masses , but found that bound units developed a steeper distribution , more similar to that of stars .",
    "this result meshed nicely with recent observations showing that the densest structures in several clouds also have a steeper mass function for masses above @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "bonnell , bate , and their collaborators constitute the second group @xcite .",
    "they also used sph , but have focused mostly on smaller , denser systems for which the gas is optically thick at high densities and the assumption of isothermality breaks down .",
    "an important issue in such simulations is the phenomenon called artificial fragmentation , which can lead to severe numerical problems . in the next subsection , we describe the approach used by the various groups for dealing with this problem .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that a minimum requirement of any grid - based simulation of a fragmenting cloud is that the algorithm can resolve the jeans mass @xmath16 ( we shall refer to this as the _ jeans criterion _ ) .",
    "the maximum mass inside a cell must be smaller than @xmath17 of the jeans mass in order to prevent a spurious , resolution - dependent effect they called _",
    "artificial fragmentation_. this effect , if present , can invalidate the results of star - formation simulations , by producing initial mass functions and accretion histories that are totally wrong .",
    "@xcite derived a different , but equivalent criterion for sph .",
    "the total mass contained inside the zone of influence of a particle must be less than about twice the jeans mass in order to prevent artificial fragmentation .",
    "as @xcite pointed out , this requirement poses a serious problem for isothermal simulations performed with sph .",
    "the jeans mass varies as @xmath18 . hence , in isothermal clouds , @xmath19 ,",
    "so the jeans mass decreases as collapse proceeds .",
    "since the smoothing lengths @xmath20 are adjusted in such a way that the mass inside the zone of influence of every particle remains constant , the jeans mass will eventually be underresolved as the density increases .",
    "there is , however , a physical lower limit to the mass of fragments , simply because the isothermal approximation breaks down at sufficiently high densities .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite extend their simulations into the high density regime by using a barotropic equation of state , which is isothermal below a certain critical density @xmath21 , and adiabatic above it ( the actual equation of state is significantly more complex [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] , but the barotropic form is a convenient approximation ) . in the adiabatic regime ,",
    "@xmath22 , hence @xmath23 and therefore @xmath24 .",
    "there is therefore a minimum jeans mass , corresponding to the critical density @xmath21 .",
    "as long as the jeans criterion is satisfied at that density , it will be satisfied in the entire system , at all times .",
    "this still poses a problem .",
    "the isothermal approximation is valid for densities up to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "for a region with mean density @xmath26 , the range of @xmath27 in density corresponds to a range of @xmath28 in jeans mass .",
    "since the smallest jeans mass must contain @xmath29 particles to satisfy the jeans criterion , _ the total number of particles in the simulation must be at least 1 million _ , and this would satisfy the jeans criterion only marginally .",
    "klessen , burkert , and their collaborators do not address the problem of artificial fragmentation .",
    "they are aware of the problem , but believe that this problem does not affect their conclusions significantly .",
    "bate , bonnell , and their collaborators are very concerned with artificial fragmentation .",
    "they avoid the problem by simulating low - mass systems ( @xmath30 ) , so that their resolution is sufficiently large to reach the regime where the gas becomes adiabatic .",
    "they can then use a barotropic equation of state .    in this paper , we consider an alternative approach that can simulate high - mass systems , in the isothermal regime , while still solving the artificial fragmentation problem .",
    "this is achieved by using _",
    "particle splitting _ , a relatively new and very promising technique @xcite .",
    "the basic idea consists of starting the simulations with a manageable number of sph particles , and then refining the mass resolution _ locally _ in regions where additional resolution is needed to satisfy the jeans criterion .",
    "original particles are automatically replaced ( or `` split '' ) by a more finely - spaced set of smaller - mass particles wherever extra resolution is required .",
    "this can be seen as the lagrangian counterpart of the adaptive mesh refinement techniques used in eulerian , grid - based algorithm .",
    "in our implementation of particle splitting , sph particles split into 8 equal - mass particles when the jeans criterion is locally violated . for an isothermal gas , this results in a new generation of particle splitting",
    "every time the density increases by an additional factor of 64 .      the primary goal of this ongoing project is to study the effect of feedback from clustered star formation on the evolution of the ism .",
    "however , the issue of feedback will not be addressed in this first paper , for the following reason : the existence of artificial fragmentation casts a huge shadow over all sph simulations of cloud fragmentation that assume an isothermal equation of state , raising doubts about the validity of such simulations .",
    "we feel that this problem is far too important to be ignored , and must be addressed first , and successfully , before we even consider implementing additional physical processes into the algorithm . _",
    "solving the problem of artificial fragmentation is an essential first step_. in this paper , we address this problem using a sph algorithm which combines self - gravity , hydrodynamics , particle splitting , and sink particles .",
    "this algorithm is described in  2 below .",
    "the main objectives of this paper are the following :    \\1 .",
    "_ test the feasibility of particle splitting , and investigate , both analytically and numerically , the interplay between particle splitting , sink particles , and the jeans criterion . _",
    "using particle splitting enables us to start up simulations with a small number of particles for a given resolution .",
    "however , the feasibility of this approach depends critically on the efficiency of particle removal by sink formation and accretion onto sinks .",
    "if a large number of particles split before the formation and growth of sinks becomes important , the total number of particles in the simulation might become too large to be manageable .",
    "it is not obvious a priori that sink formation and growth will remove particles sufficiently rapidly to offset the increase in particle number resulting from splitting .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to determine if the peak number of particles in such simulations remains manageable .",
    "_ perform a convergence study .",
    "_ we can ascribe to each simulation with particle splitting an `` effective particle number , '' which is the number of particles a simulation without particle splitting would need to achieve the same resolution in dense regions .",
    "the three simulations presented in this paper start with @xmath2 particles , and allow for @xmath1 , 1 , and 2 generations of particle splitting , respectively .",
    "the splitting factor is @xmath31 , meaning that when a particle splits , it is replaced by 8 particles , each having 1/8 of the mass of the parent particle .",
    "hence , the effective particle numbers of the three simulations are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "since we are using identical initial conditions , these three simulations taken together constitute a convergence study , the largest one ever performed for such simulations .",
    "_ perform the largest simulation of this kind ever done , in terms of effective number of sph particles or number of protostellar cores formed .",
    "_ for our largest simulation ( @xmath32 ) , the effective particle number is @xmath33 , about 33 times the largest number of particles used by kb ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "our smallest simulation ( @xmath1 , that is , no particle splitting ) uses @xmath35 particles , which is comparable to the largest isothermal simulations of kb .",
    "furthermore , we start the simulations with @xmath36 jeans masses instead of kb s 222 jeans masses . as a result",
    ", we will form a much larger number of protostellar cores .",
    "this has three advantages : first , our determination of the initial mass function of protostellar cores will be more accurate .",
    "second , it will enable us to study the mass assembly history and final structure of the cluster in more detail . and",
    "third , forming a larger number of cores might lead to the discovery of some interesting processes in the evolution of the cluster , that would not occur in a cluster with much fewer cores ; as we shall see , this is indeed the case .",
    "the evolution of a self - gravitating gas is described by the conservation equations for mass , momentum , and energy , coupled with the poisson equation and the equation of state , @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the density , @xmath39 is the pressure , @xmath40 is the specific internal energy , @xmath41 is the velocity , @xmath42 is the gravitational potential , @xmath43 is the mean density , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the radiative heating and cooling rates , respectively .",
    "equation  ( 4 ) requires some explanation . to prevent the overall collapse of the cloud , we assume that the cloud is essentially infinite , and use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , a periodic gravitational potential @xmath42 is only possible if the total mass of the system vanishes . by adding the term @xmath46 in equation  ( 4 ) , the effective mass , defined as the integral of the source term @xmath47 over the computational volume , does vanish , and a periodic solution for @xmath42 becomes possible .",
    "a valid interpretation of equation  ( 4 ) is that the term @xmath46 accounts for whichever process makes the cloud _ globally _ stable , while it is the fluctuation @xmath47 that make the cloud _ locally _ unstable . @xcite and @xcite have suggested that supersonic turbulence might explain the global stability of clouds .    it is important to realize that equation  ( 4 ) is still physically correct .",
    "since the cloud is assumed to be infinite , the term @xmath46 represents a uniform , negative density background extending to infinity in all directions , and such component can not , by symmetry , exert any force in any direction on a mass element . for a more formal description ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , and references therein .    in this paper ,",
    "the set of equations we are using is significantly simpler .",
    "first , since we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , a lagrangian , particle - based algorithm , mass is automatically conserved , and we can ignore the continuity equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "second , we assume that the gas is isothermal .",
    "the specific internal energy @xmath40 is therefore constant in space and time , and equation  ( 3 ) can be ignored as well .",
    "the equation of state , equation  ( 5 ) , becomes @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the sound speed , which is constant in an isothermal gas , and @xmath50 is the polytropic constant is the ratio of the specific heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume .",
    "a polytropic equation of state has the form @xmath51 , but such an equation is valid only if the entropy of the gas is constant both in space and time .",
    "it is often said that @xmath52 for an isothermal gas , but this is incorrect in general . in our simulations , @xmath53 , the equation of state is _ not _ polytropic , and it is the coupling between the gas and a background radiation field that makes the gas isothermal . ] .",
    "the system of equations ( 1)(5 ) reduces to @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the lagrangian time derivative .",
    "we use a hybrid gravity / hydrodynamics algorithm .",
    "the gravitational forces are computed using a @xmath57 algorithm @xcite , while the gasdynamical equations are solved using the sph algorithm ( see monaghan 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "this hybrid algorithm was originally introduced by @xcite , though we have developed our own version .",
    "our code is actually an adaptive sph ( asph ) code @xcite .",
    "the asph algorithm uses anisotropic smoothing kernels , and a special treatment of artificial viscosity that prevents spurious preheating of low - density regions .",
    "however , in this paper , we consider an isothermal equation of state , so preheating is not an issue .",
    "we decided to use isotropic smoothing kernels for now ( that is , using the adaptive sph code as a standard sph code ) .",
    "we will consider anisotropic smoothing kernels in future work .",
    "we have modified our original algorithm to include a treatment of particle splitting and sink particles .",
    "the implementation of these features is described below .",
    "we have modified our original sph algorithm to include particle splitting and sink particles .",
    "particle splitting is implemented as follows .",
    "we assume that there is a minimum number of particles @xmath58 that a jeans mass must contain in order to be properly resolved and not undergo artificial fragmentation .",
    "this gives us the _ jeans criterion_. each particle @xmath59 is required to satisfy the condition @xmath60    where @xmath16 is the jeans mass , which is a function of the density @xmath38 and specific internal energy @xmath40 , @xmath61 is the value of @xmath16 evaluated at the location of particle @xmath59 ( see  4.3 below ) , and @xmath62 is the mass of particle @xmath59",
    ". when this condition is violated , the algorithm responds by splitting particle @xmath59 into @xmath63 particles of mass @xmath64 .",
    "these new particles might themselves be split later as @xmath16 keeps decreasing . for instance , in the case of an isothermal calculation ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath19 , and there is a series of particular densities @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , ( @xmath70 ) at which particle splitting will occur .",
    "when a particle is split , the algorithm must determine the positions , velocities , masses , and smoothing lengths of the daughter particles .",
    "in the original approach of @xcite , particles are split into a sphere of 13 daughter particles forming a compact lattice .",
    "we use a different approach , in which particles are split into @xmath31 particles located on the vertices of a cube .",
    "this approach will be easier to generalize to adaptive sph later .",
    "we create the daughter particles as follows : consider a particle @xmath59 , with position @xmath71 , velocity @xmath72 , mass @xmath62 , and smoothing length @xmath73 , that violates the condition  ( 9 ) , and therefore needs to be split . if @xmath74 is the mean particle spacing in the vicinity of particle @xmath59 , the 8 daughter particles will be located at @xmath75\\,,\\ ] ]    so that the spacing between daughter particles will be @xmath76 .",
    "is located less than @xmath77 away from the edge of the box .",
    "] in the initial conditions , the smoothing lengths @xmath73 of the particles are initialized to be a multiple of the mean particle spacing : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a constant ( using the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "then , as the calculation proceeds , the algorithm evolves the smoothing lengths @xmath73 is such a way that this relation is ( roughly ) maintained locally .",
    "hence , the local particle spacing can be estimated using @xmath80 .",
    "equation  ( 10 ) reduces to @xmath81\\,.\\ ] ]    in our simulations , we generated initial conditions using @xmath82 , to provide a sufficient number of neighbors .",
    "we set the velocity of the daughter particles equal to @xmath72 .",
    "we could use a more sophisticated approach that would take the local velocity gradient into account , but this is not really necessary .",
    "particles tend to readjust themselves in one time step , erasing any velocity fluctuation at scales smaller that the smoothing length .",
    "finally , we set the masses of the daughter particles equal to @xmath83 , and their smoothing lengths equal to @xmath84 .",
    "sink particles must be used in simulations of cloud fragmentation to reduce the timesteps , if we hope to determine the initial mass fraction of collapsed fragments .",
    "it is not sufficient to use an algorithm with individual timesteps , because as the gas fragments and collapses , most sph gas particles end up in dense regions with short dynamical times . by replacing each dense clump of gas particles by a single object ,",
    "called a sink particle @xcite , we can eliminate this problem and increase the speed of the algorithm tremendously . in our implementation of sink particles",
    ", we use the method of @xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper for details .      our algorithm uses individual timesteps . each particle @xmath59 is given a timestep @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the `` basic timestep , '' and @xmath87 identifies the timestep bin where the particle belongs .",
    "sink particles are created only at the end of the basic timesteps , when all the particles are in sync .",
    "this greatly simplifies the implementation .",
    "gas particles are replaced by sinks when they reach a threshold density @xmath88 .",
    "this density threshold is a numerical parameter that does not have any physical meaning , except for the fact that the assumption of isothermality must be physically valid at all densities below @xmath88 .",
    "the smallest collapsed objects that can form in the simulations will have a mass equal to @xmath89 the jeans mass at the density @xmath88 .",
    "hence , @xmath88 fixes the mass resolution of the algorithm , much in the same way as the softening length fixes its length resolution .",
    "to create sinks , the algorithm identifies all particles whose density exceeds the threshold density @xmath88 for sink creation .",
    "these particles are then sorted in decreasing order of the density . starting with the densest particle",
    ", the algorithm finds all @xmath90 particles within a fixed radius @xmath91 of that densest particle , where @xmath91 is called the accretion radius .",
    "an important issue is how to determine the appropriate value for @xmath91 , or equivalently , how many particles @xmath90 should be turned into a sink .",
    "we shall assume that it takes a minimum number of particles , @xmath92 , to properly resolve a jeans mass , and we will set that number equal to the number of particles @xmath58 that a jeans mass must contain to prevent artificial fragmentation .",
    "this makes sense , since the negative consequence of underresolving the jeans mass is precisely to cause artificial fragmentation .",
    "the number of particles @xmath90 must also exceed the number of particles @xmath93 inside a jeans mass at the threshold density @xmath88 , otherwise sub - jeans mass objects would be turned into sinks .",
    "hence , the condition is @xmath94\\,.\\ ] ]    this ensures that every fragment replaced by a sink particle ( i ) is properly resolved , and ( ii ) contains at least a jeans mass .",
    "we adjust @xmath91 such that @xmath95 $ ] at the threshold density @xmath88 .",
    "if the values of @xmath90 are systematically smaller than @xmath96 $ ] , this would imply that we chose a value of @xmath91 that was too small , and sinks would then form at densities much larger than @xmath88 .",
    "conversely , if the values of @xmath90 are systematically larger than @xmath96 $ ] , this would indicate a value of @xmath91 that was too large , effectively reducing the mass resolution of the algorithm , by forming objects that are too massive .",
    "the actual determination of @xmath91 is described below .    to create a sink particle ,",
    "a second condition must be satisfied , @xmath97    where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the thermal and gravitational energies of the particles inside the accretion radius , respectively .",
    "@xcite use @xmath100 as a criterion .",
    "however , using equation  ( [ alpha ] ) is more consistent with the fact that we are trying to turn jeans - mass clumps into sinks , since by definition @xmath101 for a uniform sphere of mass @xmath102 .",
    "if both conditions are satisfied , the particles inside @xmath91 are removed and replaced by a sink particle , which inherits the properties of the parent particles ( center of mass position and velocity , total mass , and total angular momentum ) .",
    "the algorithm then selects the next densest particle _ still available _",
    "( some particles with @xmath103 might have been incorporated into sinks created around denser particles ) , and the process is repeated until all particles with @xmath103 have been considered .",
    "two physical processes can increase the mass of protostellar cores : mergers with other cores , and accretion of gas by cores . in the algorithm",
    ", these processes correspond to merging of sinks , and accretion of sph gas particles by sinks , respectively .",
    "the merging of sinks is an interesting issue .",
    "allowing sinks to merge would clearly affect the final mass distribution of protostellar cores .",
    "unfortunately , no known prescription exists for implementing sink merging into a sph algorithm . we intend to investigate this issue in a separate paper , but for now we will make the usual assumption that sink particles do not merge , as in @xcite , kb , and others .",
    "accretion of gas particles onto sinks is also performed at the end of each basic timestep .",
    "the algorithm checks for gas particles that are located inside the accretion radius @xmath91 of a sink particle .",
    "these particles are then accreted by the sinks , and the sink properties ( position , velocity , mass , angular momentum ) are updated accordingly . if a gas particle is within the accretion radius of several sinks , we compute the total energy of the ( particle + sink ) systems , and choose the sink for which this energy is the smallest .",
    "unlike @xcite , we do not require that the energy be negative .",
    "such a criterion would fail in general , because in these simulations the gas tends to fall onto sinks at supersonic speeds that exceed the escape velocity from the sink .",
    "this happens when gas particles are accelerated by large mass concentrations , that might contain several sinks .",
    "a gas particle approaching a cluster of sinks will be accelerated by the whole cluster , and will acquire a velocity comparable to the escape velocity from the whole cluster . but this velocity will always exceed the escape velocity from the particular sink that will accrete that particle . hence , the gas particle will not be gravitationally bound to the sink onto which it accretes .",
    "this is not a concern , because the physical process responsible for the final stage of accretion is not gravitational capture , but rather physical collision between a gas particle and a sink . in a simulation without sinks , a gas particle approaching a dense clump at supersonic speed",
    "would be decelerated down to subsonic speeds by the artificial viscosity , resulting in the conversion of kinetic energy into thermal energy , that would then be radiated away since the gas is assumed to be isothermal . but this process would occur at scales smaller than @xmath91 , and therefore can not occur when clumps are being replaced by sinks . by allowing large - velocity particles to accrete onto sinks , we are essentially putting - in the subgrid physics of collision , viscous deceleration , and radiative dissipation by clumps smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "when using sinks , boundary conditions must be applied at the accretion radius @xmath91 , otherwise the sph calculation of the density , pressure forces , and viscous forces on gas particles located immediately outside @xmath91 would be incorrect , resulting in spurious effects .",
    "this is discussed in great detail in @xcite , and also in @xcite .",
    "our implementation of boundary conditions follows the description of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in our simulations , the effect of boundary conditions turns out to be quite small .",
    "we found that most gas particles fall radially toward sinks , and collide with them at supersonic speeds .",
    "as @xcite point out , viscous boundary conditions have a negligible effect for particles falling radially , while pressure boundary conditions have a negligible effect for particles moving supersonically .",
    "our findings are consistent with that claim .",
    "in this section , we discuss some aspects of the numerical simulations of cloud fragmentation , including the interplay between resolution , artificial fragmentation , particle splitting , and sink pyarticles . for the sake of the discussion , we consider a particular simulation of kb , which we call the `` benchmark simulation . '' for this particular simulation , the number of particles is @xmath104 , the initial number of jeans masses is @xmath105 , the mean density , in computational units , is @xmath106 , and the threshold density for creating sinks is @xmath107 . for the number of particles necessary to prevent artificial fragmentation , we assume @xmath108",
    "( this is a guess ; no value of @xmath109 is provided by kb ) .",
    "notice that this is one of the highest - resolution simulation performed by kb .",
    "they have performed a higher - resolution simulation with @xmath110 , and by lowering the threshold density and the initial number of jeans masses , they were able to increase their mass resolution significantly . because of the reduced number of jeans masses in this simulation , the more suitable calculation for us to use as a benchmark is the one with @xmath104 .",

    "the most obvious solution ( 1 ) consists of reducing @xmath88 down to @xmath125 or less , so that fragments would turn into sink particles before they are dense enough to experience artificial fragmentation .",
    "the obvious drawback of this approach is that the simulation would completely miss the late - stage evolution of dense fragments .",
    "if we keep the threshold density at a value @xmath107 , we must then find a way to increase the number of particles per jeans mass .",
    "we could ( 2 ) increase the initial jeans mass @xmath115 by a factor of @xmath126 , so that by the time the density reaches @xmath88 , the jeans mass would still contain enough particles to be properly resolved .",
    "however , for a fixed initial number @xmath112 of particles , this would reduce the initial number of jeans masses in the system from @xmath105 down to @xmath127 , leading to poor statistics , as very few cores would form .",

    "there are 4 basic arguments for why cores that form earlier should reach higher masses : ( 1 )  since they form earlier , they have more time to grow by accretion , ( 2 )  the cores that form early will deplete their surroundings by accretion , reducing the amount of gas available to cores that form later , ( 3 )  by being more massive , the cores that form early have a stronger gravitational potential than the ones forming late , making them more efficient in accreting the reminder of the surrounding gas , and ( 4 ) if several cores of different masses are present inside a gaseous clump , the most massive cores will tend to reside in the center of the clump where there is presumably more gas to accrete . while argument  ( 1 ) is general ,",
    "arguments  ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) are valid only if cores form out of the same clump , and are therefore competing for the same surrounding gas .",

    "finally , this process terminates : core  # 5 is created almost immediately after core  # 4 , providing little time for the latter to grow , so that at @xmath249 , cores  # 4 and # 5 have comparable masses .",
    "we are then in the `` big peak '' in figure 11a , with many cores forming at comparable times .",
    "we have focused so far on run a , and investigated the origin of the various features found in figure  8a .",

    "the results are qualitatively similar to run  a. there is a definite tendency of the mass to decrease with increasing birth rank .",
    "the distributions are very wide , however , and show several peaks at high birth rank , which we again attribute to competitive accretion .",
    "there is a noticeable difference in the higher - resolution runs : the absence of very - low mass cores at small birth ranks .",
    "early ejections seem far less common in these simulations .",
    "this can be explained using the following argument .",
    "consider an envelope of gas of mass @xmath250 and radius @xmath251 , containing several cores of mass @xmath252 , forming a small , bound cluster of radius @xmath253 , inside which the mean core spacing is @xmath254 .",
    "the gravitational force @xmath255 between cores is proportional to @xmath256 , and therefore the acceleration @xmath257 of the cores varies with @xmath252 as @xmath258    for a fixed cluster radius @xmath253 , the core spacing @xmath254 depends on the number of cores , and for a fixed cluster mass , that number of cores depends on the resolution , such that @xmath259 ( if the mass per core is smaller , the cluster contains more cores , thus those cores are closer to one another ) . hence @xmath260 .",
    "if a core is ejected from the cluster , its terminal velocity should be of order @xmath261 .",
    "but the escape velocity from the whole system is of order @xmath262 , independent of @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , lowering @xmath252 makes it more difficult for cores ejected from the cluster to escape the common envelope of gas .",
    "figures 8b and 8c show several peaks , corresponding to high - mass cores with high birth ranks .",
    "we examined several cases , indicated by asterisks . in all cases",
    ", we found that the high masses resulted from local competitive accretion .",
    "all these cores formed in regions located away from the main cluster , often in emerging filaments . in several cases , these filaments contained a string of cores ( as seen , for instance , in fig .",
    "5 ) , and the core that reached a high mass was the one located at the very end of the string .",
    "this is an example of local competitive accretion , and perhaps the core at the end is able to accrete from a larger solid angle .",
    "we did not find a late starburst ( or coreburst ) in the high - resolution simulations .",
    "the gas located in very low regions does fall into the cluster in the form of gas , but tends to be accreted onto the cores rather than forming new cores .",
    "accretion is much more efficient in the higher - resolution simulations simply because of the sheer number of cores in the cluster at late time .",
    "that number is very small for run  a because ( 1 ) core  # 1 contains more than half the final mass of the cluster , and ( 2 ) as we shall see in  5.6 , the cluster suffers a great deal of evaporation at late time in run  a. hence , the cross section for accretion onto cluster cores is greatly reduced in the low - resolution simulation compared with the high - resolution ones , which explains why the late starbust phenomenon is seen only at low resolution .",
    "we did not observe the kind of runaway accretion experienced by the first core in run a. while that core reaches a final mass of 0.358 ( 35.8% of the total mass in the computational volume ) , the final masses of the first cores formed in runs b and c are 0.00295 and 0.000803 , respectively .",
    "actually , the core which ends up with the largest mass in run c is not core # 1 , but rather core # 707 , with a final mass of 0.00263 . in run",
    "a , runaway accretion occurred because the first core formed significantly earlier than the others . with higher resolution ,",
    "several lower - mass cores form almost simultaneously inside the first region that reaches the threshold density , and competitive accretion among these cores prevents runaway accretion .    comparing all these results with the ones presented in  5.4 ,",
    "we conclude that local competitive accretion is a fundamental process that occurs at all resolutions , except in situations where a small number of cores results in the formation of a single cluster ( as in the simulations of kb ) .",
    "in such a case , competitive accretion does occur , but it is not local .",
    "other phenomena , like early ejection , late starburst , and runaway accretion , appear to be peculiarities of low - resolution runs , and become less common as the resolution increases .",
    "all three simulations end up forming a dense cluster of protostellar cores . in this section",

    "on the top panel , the number of cores for runs a and b have been multiplied by factors of 25 and 2.75 , respectively , to allow a better comparison .",
    "the thick vertical lines indicate the transitions between the collapse , accretion , and n - body regimes , as indicated.,title=\"fig:\",width=499 ] -0.2 in    to identify the cores that belong to the cluster , we first use visual inspection to make an initial estimate @xmath263 of the center of the cluster .",
    "then , using an iterative method , we find a self - consistent solution for the center of mass @xmath264 and radius @xmath265 of the cluster , such that ( 1 ) the center of mass of the cores located inside a sphere of radius @xmath265 centered on @xmath264 is indeed @xmath264 , and ( 2 ) the mean density @xmath266 inside that sphere is 200 times the mean density in the system .",
    "notice that these densities are computed using the cores only , without the gas , as in kb .",
    "figure  12a shows the time - evolution of the number of cores in the cluster , for all three runs .",
    "we have rescaled the number of cores for runs a and b by factors of 25 and 2.75 , respectively , for comparison with run c. the number of cores for run a ( solid curve ) varies tremendously , in a somewhat chaotic way .",
    "these large fluctuations can be attributed to small statistics , run a having the smallest total number of cores . however",
    ", this is not the only explanation .",
    "our method for determining cluster membership assumes spherical symmetry , but in run a , the cluster tends to be triaxial during most of the calculation , and also the sphere of radius @xmath265 which contains the cluster members tends to follow the motion of core # 1 , since that core contains most of the mass of the cluster .",
    "so as core # 1 experiences brownian motion around the center of the cluster , cores located near the surface of the sphere keep `` falling '' in and out of the cluster .",
    "this does not occur with the higher - resolution runs , because the cluster tends to be quite spherical , and no single core dominates its mass .    during the collapse regime ( @xmath267 )",
    ", cores are forming inside the cluster , increasing the number of cluster members .",
    "there are few ejections during this phase , and the net effect is a near - monotonic increase in the number of cores .",
    "once the system enters the accretion regime , few new cores are forming , and the competing processes are ejections from the cluster and accretion of cores that formed in secondary clumps outside the main cluster .",
    "indeed , the main cluster experiences a major merger with another , comparable cluster , at @xmath268 , near the end of the collapse phase , resulting in a sudden increase in the number of cores . for runs b and c , the number of cores tends to increase during the accretion regime , indicating that accretion of cores formed in subclumps dominates over ejections . for run",
    "a , however , the ejections tend to dominate .",
    "once the system enters the n - body regime ( @xmath269 ) , the number of cores steadily decreases for runs a and b. all the cores formed outside the main cluster have been accreted along with the remaining gas , and ejections become the dominant process .",
    "however , the number of cores in run c remains nearly constant , indicating that very few ejections are taking place .",
    "figure 12b shows the evolution of the mass of the cluster .",
    "the results are nearly identical for all three runs up to @xmath268 , when the major merger takes place .",
    "from that point , run a differs significantly from the other two runs , as the mass of the cluster grows much more slowly .",
    "interestingly , in the n - body regime , the mass of the cluster , for run a , remains nearly constant even though the number of cores drops significantly .",
    "this indicates that only low - mass cores are ejected at late time .",
    "the most striking result shown in figure 12b is the similarity between the results of runs b and c. the curves are essentially indistinguishable up to the beginning of the accretion phase , and then remain very similar up to the end of the simulation , having in particular the same local maxima at @xmath270 , 1.58 , and 2.05 , and the same local minima at @xmath271 and 1.61 .",
    "notice also the sudden increase in mass at @xmath272 , corresponding to a merger with a smaller subcluster of cores .",

    "the distributions are roughly log - normal , with some skewness toward high masses , as the dashed curves show .",
    "kb reported that the mass distribution peaks at the initial jeans mass of the system .",
    "our results are consistent with that claim , but only for run  a. as the number of splitting generations , or equivalently the mass resolution of the algorithm , increases , the distribution shifts to lower masses while keeping the same width in @xmath277 . clearly , it is the resolution , and not the initial jeans mass , that determines the location of the peak .",
    "as the resolution increases , the algorithm can form cores with smaller masses , until the resolution is so high that the jeans mass @xmath89 at the threshold density @xmath133 is resolved . hence , increasing the resolution moves the low - mass end of the distribution to lower masses .",
    "this leads to the formation of a larger number of cores , which then have to compete for accretion . as a result",
    ", the high - mass end of the distribution also moves to lower masses .",
    "note that the shift to lower masses results only from increasing @xmath132 because @xmath88 is the same in all three runs .",
    "these log - normal distributions ( for runs b and c ) are consistent with the numerical results of kb .",
    "however , they are inconsistent with observations that show a peak at small masses and a power - law like behavior at the high - mass end .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this .",
    "once sinks form , they can no longer fragment . in the real world",
    ", these objects might fragment , increasing the number of low - mass objects relative to high - mass ones ( notice that sink merging , which we also ignore , would have the opposite effect ) .",
    "we did not take turbulence into account in these simulations .",
    "turbulence could affect the dynamical evolution of the system differently at different scales , affecting the final shape of the mass distribution .",
    "probably even more importantly , feedback effects , if included , could slow down the growth of massive cores by accretion .",
    "finally , we could consider changing the slope of the power spectrum of initial density fluctuation , though kb did this @xcite , and found that the distributions of core masses remained log - normal .",
    "the three simulations we have performed all start with @xmath2 particles , and use identical initial conditions .",
    "however , particle splitting increases the effective resolution of the simulations , which is @xmath3 for run b and @xmath4 for run c. since the initial conditions are identical but the effective resolution varies , this set of simulations constitutes a convergence study , which can be used to estimate the minimum resolution necessary to obtain reliable results .",
    "it is clear , however , that some results simply will not converge . by requiring that sink particles are created with enough gas particles to insure that they are resolved ( that is , scenario ii , by opposition to scenario i ) , the initial mass of sinks depends on resolution , and as a result the imf of cores shown in figure  15 shifts to lower masses as the resolution increases .",
    "however , the results of run c have converged , since that simulation does resolve the jeans mass .",
    "if we added a run d with @xmath278 to our set of simulations , the results of runs c and d would be identical , because a third level of splitting would never occur : before the density gets large enough to make particles split a third time , these particles would turn into sinks ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this convergence is _ numerical _ in the sense that numerical parameters like @xmath88 and @xmath132 determine the solution that the simulation converges to .",
    "a solution that would converge _ physically _ does not exist , and therefore can not be achieved , in a system with an isothermal equation of state , because no physical process limits the minimum mass of cores . in the real universe ,",
    "the assumption of isothermality breaks down at high densities when the gas becomes optically thick , and that in turns leads to a physical minimum mass for cores .",
    "looking at the macroscopic properties of the final cluster of cores , it is clear that the results of runs a and b are significantly different , while the results of runs b and c are very similar , indicating that convergence has been achieved . in particular , the mass history of the cluster ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "12 ) and the density profile at various times ( fig .",
    "14 ) are strikingly similar for runs b and c. in run a , the first core formed underwent runaway accretion , which affected the further evolution of the cluster .",
    "no such runaway accretion occurred in runs b and c. we believe that the likelihood of such occurrence is reduced as the resolution increases , because as more cores are formed , the time interval between the formation of a core and the next one is reduced , thus increasing the competition for accretion .",
    "finally , there are other results , arguably less interesting , that show convergence . in particular , the formation time histograms shown in figure  11 are quite similar for runs b and c , and different for run a , with the bulk of the cores forming at later time .",
    "to compare the results to observations , it is convenient to use the relations in  4.3 to convert the densities , masses , etc . to physical units . because the simulations contain 500 jeans masses initially , the total mass and other properties are uniquely fixed by a choice of temperature and density .",

    "alternatively , we could use the accretion radius ( @xmath91 , see  2.4 ) instead of the kernel radius .",
    "these two radii turn out to be very similar , so the results are not significantly affected .",
    "the 4 cases listed in table  4 are simply scaled to different values of the initial density .",
    "the first is roughly similar to the example given by @xcite , which they compare to the taurus cloud .",
    "our case 1 has about twice the mass of that of kb because we have roughly twice as many jeans masses .",
    "our definition of jeans mass is slightly different , and other differences combine to make our value for @xmath183 about twice their value .",
    "the cases with higher initial densities approximate the conditions in cluster forming regions .",
    "case 3 is similar to the conditions in the l1688 ( ophiuchus ) cluster , which has @xmath312 in a region extending about 1 pc @xcite .",
    "case 4 approximates conditions in the massive , dense regions studied by @xcite ; the median radius of gas traced by cs emission in their study is 0.37 pc , and the mean virial mass is about 1200 .",
    "mass estimates based on the 350  emission @xcite for a subsample of those sources yield mean values around 300 .    putting the mass functions shown in figure  15 into physical units",
    "is probably premature because we have not yet included many effects , such as feedback from early star formation . if we proceed with these caveats in mind , we find that the mass function , in the simulation with @xmath313 , and for case 3 , peaks around 0.3 , with a maximum mass around 2.0  and a minimum mass of 0.03 , well into the region of brown dwarfs .",
    "case 4 produces even lower mass objects , with a peak in the distribution around 0.1 .",
    "this is not surprising since there is no limit to how small the jeans mass may get with an isothermal equation of state .",
    "clearly the other effects , which are the subject of future work , will need to be included before these distributions can be compared to the observed mass functions .",
    "we have performed three simulations of fragmenting molecular clouds , using identical initial conditions , but different levels of particle splitting .",
    "each additional level corresponds to an increase by a factor of 2 in length resolution and 8 in mass resolution .",
    "we have discovered several interesting phenomena , which we described in  5 above . some of the results , such as the runaway accretion and the late starburst , were found only in the lowest - resolution simulation , and thus are clearly resolution - dependent .",
    "such phenomena are peculiarities that happen sometimes when the number of cores is relatively small .",
    "we found three results that are not resolution - dependent : ( 1 ) the existence of four distinct regimes in the evolution of the cloud , ( 2 ) the phenomenon of local competitive accretion , and ( 3 ) the tight relationship between the mass range of the imf and the resolution limit of the algorithm , until the calculation is fully resolved .    in these initial simulations , we have neglected several physical processes , such as turbulence , non - isothermality , and feedback , which will be addressed in future work .",
    "we believe that the three main results stated above are robust , and will remain valid once we include additional physical processes ( though this remains to be proven ) .",
    "first , the existence of the four distinct regimes should not be affected by additional physics .",
    "the gas will always end up into cores given enough time , so there will always be a n - body regime at the late stages .",
    "the fact that half the gas turns into cores during the growth regime , while the other half is accreted during the accretion regime , is most likely a consequence of the gaussianity of the initial conditions .",
    "local competitive accretion occurs because the timescale for the fragmentation of subclumps into cores is shorter than the timescale for these clumps to merge and form the final cluster .",
    "this could possibly be affected by turbulence or feedback , since these processes could delay core formation inside subclumps . in particular , the feedback from the first core forming in a given subclump could possibly prevent the formation of other cores in the same subclump , so that the final cluster would form by the merger of several subclumps , each one containing only one core .",
    "it remains to be seen if the effect of feedback could be that drastic .",
    "we need a particular mass or length scale in the problem to determine the mass range of the imf . in our simulations ,",
    "the gas is isothermal , and there are no physical scale in the system .",
    "it is then a numerical scale , the minimum jeans mass resolved by the algorithm , that determines the lower edge of the imf . in simulations with a barotropic equation of state",
    ", the scale corresponds to the jeans mass at the density where the gas becomes adiabatic .",
    "turbulence and feedback could introduce a physical scale as well .",
    "but in all cases , there is no apparent reason for having a relationship between the mean initial jeans mass and the lower edge of the imf .",
    "whatever the initial jeans mass is , we expect the cloud to fragment down to the lowest mass scale allowed by either the physical processes or the numerical resolution .",
    "this paper presented simulations of the fragmentation of a molecular cloud in which artificial fragmentation is prevented by using particle splitting , a technique that had not yet been applied to this kind of problem . with this technique",
    ", we can follow the evolution of the entire cloud , from the initial conditions to the formation of a star cluster , while fully resolving the jeans mass at all densities .",
    "the main objective of this paper was to demonstrate the feasibility of simulating the formation of a star cluster by cloud fragmentation , while properly resolving the jeans mass throughout the entire simulation .",
    "we have successfully shown that , with the use of particle splitting , this can be achieved at a small fraction of the computational cost of a standard high - resolution or a `` zoom - in '' simulation . in particular , our largest simulation ( run c ) , which fully resolves the jeans mass , has an effective resolution of @xmath4 , or 17 million particles , while the actual number of particles in that simulation varies but never exceeds 1.1 million .",
    "the gain in performance is huge , and would only increase with additional splitting generations .",
    "we have identified four distinct phases in the evolution of the cloud , corresponding to four different regimes .",
    "initially , the cloud is in the growth regime .",
    "overdense regions become denser and eventually form a network of filaments . then , in the collapse regime , the gas in dense regions is converted into protostellar cores . in the accretion regime , the remaining gas , which started up in underdense regions",
    ", is mainly accreted by the existing cores . finally",
    ", in the n - body regime , most of the gas has disappeared , and the evolution of the cluster is governed by n - body dynamics .",
    "these various regimes were certainly present in previous simulations , such as the ones of kb , but were not explicitly identified .",
    "the existence of a collapse and an accretion phase , and the fact that roughly 50% of the gas is removed during the collapse phase and 50% during the accretion phase , is most likely a mere consequence of the gaussianity of the initial conditions , though this remains to be tested .    in the lowest - resolution simulation , we have noticed several interesting phenomena , such as early ejection , local competitive accretion , late starburst , and runaway accretion .",
    "early ejections ( also noticed by kb and @xcite ) occur during few - body encounters , and explain how cores that form early stop accreting and end up having a low mass .",
    "local competitive accretion is a new phenomenon that we have identified .",
    "it occurs when several clumps of gas fragment to form sub - clusters of cores that later merge to form the final cluster .",
    "the first core formed in each clump does not compete for accretion until other cores form in the same clump , and can therefore reach high masses even if it formed late in the overall simulation .",
    "this explain most of the high - mass peaks at high birth ranks seen in figure  8 .",
    "late starburst is caused by gas that was never dense enough to form cores until it falls into the main cluster at late times and gets suddenly shocked to very high densities .",
    "runaway accretion occurs when the first core formed in the simulation formed significantly earlier that the next cores , and thus gets an early start in accreting gas .",
    "the mass difference then increases as a result of competitive accretion , and that core ends up containing a large fraction ( up to one third ) of the mass of the entire system . while all these phenomena were observed in the lowest - resolution simulation , only local competitive accretion",
    "was observed in the higher - resolution simulations .",
    "this suggests that local competitive accretion is a fundamental process that greatly affects the evolution of the system , while the other phenomena are less fundamental , and might not have occurred at all ( or to a very different extent ) if we had used different initial conditions .",
    "we believe that it is the small number of cores formed in the lowest - resolution simulation , and not its inability to resolve the jeans mass , that is responsible for the occurrence of these phenomena .",
    "the final distribution of the core masses are roughly log - normal ( in agreement with the isothermal simulations of kb ) , except for the lowest - resolution simulation , where the runaway accretion of core # 1 results in a very skewed distribution . the location of the distribution shifts to lower masses as the resolution increases , until the resolution is sufficient to resolve the jeans mass .",
    "this is a consequence of our decision to follow `` scenario  ii '' for the simulations with @xmath169 and 2 , requiring that dense clumps are converted into cores only if they contain at least @xmath314 particles .",
    "had we followed scenario  i , all simulations would have produced ( presumably ) distributions with the same mean .",
    "we found that the mean of the distribution is determined entirely by the resolution , and not by the mean jeans mass at the initial time , in contradiction with the claim of kb .",

    "<S> we present a series of simulations of the fragmentation of a molecular cloud , leading to the formation of a cluster of protostellar cores . </S>",
    "<S> we use gaussian initial conditions with a power spectrum @xmath0 , assume an isothermal equation of state , and neglect turbulence and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of these simulations is to address a specific numerical problem called _ artificial fragmentation _ , that plagues simulations of cloud fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed , and that the only reasonable and practical way to address it within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics algorithm ( sph ) is to use a relatively new technique called _ particle splitting_.    we performed three simulations , in which we allow @xmath1 , 1 , and 2 levels of particle splitting . </S>",
    "<S> all simulations start up with @xmath2 sph particles , but their effective resolutions correspond to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 particles , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the third simulation properly resolves the jeans mass throughout the entire system , at all times , thus preventing artificial fragmentation .    the high resolution of our simulations results in the formation of a large number of protostellar cores , nearly 3000 for the largest simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this greatly exceeds the typical number of cores ( @xmath5 ) formed in previous simulations , and enabled us to discover various processes that affect the growth of the cores and the evolution of the cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the cloud follows four distinct phases , or regimes . </S>",
    "<S> initially , during the _ growth regime _ , the cloud evolves into a network of intersecting filaments . after roughly one dynamical time </S>",
    "<S> , core formation starts inside the dense gaseous fragments located at the intersection of the filaments , and to a lesser extent inside the filaments themselves , and the cloud enters the _ collapse regime_. during this regime about 50% of the gas , essentially the gas that started up in overdense regions , is converted into cores . </S>",
    "<S> competitive accretion is the main process that controls the mass evolution of cores , but we discovered that this process occurs _ locally _ , within each dense fragment . during the following _ accretion regime _ , most of the remaining gas does not form new cores , but rather accretes onto the existing cores . </S>",
    "<S> eventually each gaseous fragment has turned into a subcluster of cores , and these subclusters later merge to form the final cluster . the gas left in the system has become negligible , and the system has reached the _ </S>",
    "<S> n - body regime _ , in which the dynamics of the cluster is governed by n - body dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the final mass distribution of cores has a lognormal distribution , whose mean value is resolution - dependent ; the distribution shifts down in mass as the resolution improves . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the distribution is about 1.5 ( e.g. , a factor of 30 in the mass ) , and the low - mass edge of the distribution corresponds to the lowest core mass that the code can resolve . </S>",
    "<S> this result differs from previous claims of a relationship between the mean of the distribution and the initial jeans mass . </S>"
