    "altogether the cross sections for processes ( [ jj ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are , respectively , the sm cross section , interference between the sm and the anomalous contribution and the pure anomalous cross section .",
    "this process receives contributions from @xmath57 and @xmath91 vertices which get modified by all operators in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) . however , as seen in the first line in eq .",
    "( [ group ] ) there are only four independent lorentz invariant structures contributing to this process which , consequently , is only able to give information on the four linear combinations of anomalous couplings corresponding to the four coefficients , @xmath92 , ( @xmath93 ) defined in eqs .",
    "( [ jj1 ] ) and  ( [ jj2 ] ) .",
    "process ( [ jj ] ) receives contributions from @xmath94 and @xmath95 productions in association to photons as well as from @xmath96 and @xmath97 fusion processes @xmath98 in order to reduce the enormous qcd background we must exploit the characteristics of the wbf reactions .",
    "the main feature of wbf processes is a pair of very far forward / backward tagging jets with significant transverse momentum and large invariant mass between them .",
    "therefore , we required that the jets should comply with @xmath99 furthermore , the photons are central , typically being between the tagging jets .",
    "so , we require that the photons satisfy @xmath100    further reduction of the sm background can be achieved by a cut in the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath21 pairs . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ im_gg_signal ] , the invariant mass distribution for the sm background contribution is a decreasing function of the @xmath21 invariant mass while the anomalous contribution first increases with the @xmath21 invariant mass reaching its maximum value at @xmath101 gev and then decreases .",
    "consequently , in order to enhance the wbf signal for the anomalous couplings we imposed the following additional cut in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum @xmath102    -1 .",

    "these results were obtained using @xmath103 as the factorization scale in the parton distribution functions .",

    "is @xmath105 52% which is included in the results presented in tables  [ tabano_aa ] and  [ tabsm_aa ] .",
    "the interference terms ( @xmath88 ) between the anomalous and sm amplitudes turn out to be negligible .",
    "as expected the @xmath96 fusion process due to @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) leads to a larger anomalous contribution ( by a factor @xmath108 ) than the @xmath97 fusion ones due to the @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",

    "we found that for our reference value @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xmath115    changes in the factorization and renormalization scales , can modify this prediction by a factor @xmath116 5 .",
    "thus , again , the best strategy to accurately determine the sensitivity to the anomalous coupling is to extract the value of the sm background from data in a region of phase space where no signal is expected and then extrapolate to the signal region . following the discussion in the previous section , we find that the @xmath117 invariant mass distribution is suitable to estimate the sm background and reduce the qcd uncertainties .",
    "we have defined the ratio @xmath118 and evaluated the behavior of @xmath119 under changes of the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "we determined that @xmath119 can be known within an accuracy of @xmath120 15% when we use leading order calculations .    in order to extract the attainable limits on the anomalous couplings we assumed a luminosity of @xmath121 fb@xmath19 and that the observed number of events is compatible with the expectations for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , _",
    "i.e. _ the expected number of background events in the signal region is @xmath122 .",
    "we have added to the statistical error associated with this background the theoretical error associated to the uncertainty in the extrapolation of the background .",
    "however , given the limited statistics , the sensitivity is dominated by the statistical error .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "constraints on the anomalous couplings are @xmath123 which have been obtained including a 15% qcd uncertainty , however , to the precision quoted , the impact of this uncertainty is minimal .    comparing the limits in eqs .",
    "( [ llalimits ] ) with the corresponding ones from the process ( [ jj ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ aalimits ] ) we see that , despite the limited statistics , the presence of the @xmath124 vertex ( @xmath125 or @xmath126 ) makes the process @xmath127 most sensitive to the presence of np leading to anomalous four - vector couplings which respect the @xmath128 gauge invariance as well as the @xmath129 custodial symmetry .",
    "one of the reasons for the process @xmath127 to be more sensitive to anomalous interactions is that almost all lorentz structures lead similar contributions and that more lorentz structures contribute to this reaction than in @xmath130 for a given effective operator .",
    "one must keep in mind , however , that the results in eqs .",
    "( [ aalimits ] ) and ( [ llalimits ] ) were obtained under the assumption that only one operator is different from zero , so no cancellations were possible .",
    "if cancellations are allowed the process ( [ jj ] ) may become the most sensitive one to the presence of the relevant photonic quartic operators .",
    "we are just beginning to test the sm predictions for the quartic vector boson interactions . due to",
    "the limited available center  of  mass energy , the first couplings to be studied should contain photons .",
    "in particular , the direct searches at lepii have lead to constraints of the order @xmath131 for the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) , and no significantly better sensitivity is expected from searches at tevatron .",
    "anomalous quartic couplings contribute at the one  loop level to the @xmath126 physics  @xcite via oblique corrections as they modify the @xmath132 , @xmath126 , and photon two  point functions .",
    "consequently they can be indirectly constrained by precision electroweak data to @xmath133 .",
    "higher energy colliders will be able to test quartic gauge couplings involving photons as well as to probe non - photonic vertices @xmath134 ( @xmath135 or @xmath126 )  @xcite . even at lhc energies , due to phase space limitations ,",
    "the best experimental sensitivity is expected for couplings involving photons which can be part of the final state . moreover , in the event that a departure from the sm predictions is observed , inference of the underlying dynamics can only be obtained by comparing the observations in different channels , for instance between those involving triple and quartic - gauge couplings . in this respect",
    "it will also be important to know whether np reveals itself in the form of anomalous four - gauge couplings involving only weak gauge bosons or in those involving photons or in both .",
    "for instance , in the framework of chiral lagrangians , where no light higgs state is observed , the photonic four vertices are expected to be suppressed with respect to the non - photonic ones since they appear one order higher in the momentum expansion . an anomalous signal only in the photonic couplings",
    "could indicate that there are additional symmetries forbidding the non - photonic vertices .    with this motivation , in this work",
    "we have analyzed the production of two jets in association with a photon pair , or with a photon and a @xmath136 pair at lhc as tests of anomalous bosonic quartic couplings involving one or two photons . in this study",
    "we have taken careful account of the theoretical uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the sm background .",
    "we have proposed the best strategy to estimate the expected sm background by extrapolation of the data taken in a region of phase space where no signal is expected , minimizing the theoretical uncertainty associated to this extrapolation .",
    "the final sensitivity to the different couplings is given in eqs .",
    "( [ aalimits ] ) and ( [ llalimits ] ) .",
    "in particular , we found that in the framework of @xmath11 gauge invariant np in which the deviations from the sm prediction for the @xmath137 vertices are related to the strength of the anomalous @xmath124 vertex , the process @xmath138 is the most sensitive to all possible operators , despite the limited statistics , barring possible cancellations .",
    "it can lead to constraints @xmath139@xmath140 .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the study of the processes ( [ jj ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) at lhc can test quartic anomalous couplings that are four orders of magnitude weaker than the existing limits from direct searches and two orders of magnitude weaker than any indirect constraints .",
    "it is interesting to notice that if no signal is found the lhc will lead to limits that are similar to the ones that could be attainable at an @xmath84 collider operating at @xmath141 gev with a luminosity of 300 fb@xmath19  @xcite .",
