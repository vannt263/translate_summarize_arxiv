    "galaxy clusters are the most massive bound structures in the universe , sign - posting dark matter and acting as laboratories inside which the nature of dark matter can be investigated ( e.g. spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the cluster mass function is a sensitive test of cosmological parameters ( e.g. bahcall et al .",
    "several techniques have been used to estimate cluster profiles and masses , including x - ray studies , dynamics of cluster members and gravitational lensing . for clusters to be useful as cosmological probes , remaining systematics in these methods must be addressed .",
    "one such systematic is the presence of large - scale structure along the line - of - sight .",
    "hoekstra ( 2003 ) has estimated that uncorrelated large - scale structure can increase errors on weak lensing determined virial masses by a factor of two .",
    "a means to minimize the impact of large - scale structure in the context of cluster detection has been proposed by maturi et al .",
    "another concern is non - linear structure close to the line - of - sight : for example , lokas et al .",
    "( 2006 ) performed an analysis of the velocities of galaxies in the abell 1689 field , a @xmath0 cluster at @xmath1 , concluding that dynamical estimates of the cluster mass are extremely sensitive to which galaxies are considered to be cluster members or to belong to other structures .",
    "they suggest that unbound structures , clearly seen in velocity space , might also impact on the lensing analysis of this cluster .",
    "it is this issue that we address here , in the broader context of massive cluster lenses .",
    "abell 1689 is not atypical in complexity , both considering other cluster fields ( e.g. cl0024 + 1654 , czoske et al .",
    "2002 ) and from simulations . as an illustration of the latter , we searched the virgo - millennium database ( springel et al . 2005 ; lemson et al .",
    "2006 ) for haloes more massive than @xmath2 ( the mass being taken within a radius where the halo has an overdensity 200 times the critical density of the simulation ) in the @xmath3 output of the simulation .",
    "of the 13 haloes contained in that volume ( a cube of 500@xmath4 on a side ) , 3 have at least 1 halo of mass ratio less than 20:1 within a comoving radius of 8@xmath4 .",
    "a model which is commonly used to describe virialized haloes is the nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ; 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) , which is found to be a good fit to roughly 70% of clusters in simulations ( jing 2000 ) . the nfw model is often parametrized with a mass @xmath5 ( roughly equivalent to a virial mass ) and a concentration parameter @xmath6 .",
    "values of @xmath6 at odds with the distribution obtained from cosmological simulations for structures of similar mass have recently been claimed : for example , from a combined weak and strong lensing analysis of abell 1689 , broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2005 ) determined @xmath7 , typical of _ galaxy _ mass haloes , whereas @xmath8 is expected for massive cluster haloes ( e.g. nfw ) .",
    "the fact that clusters are triaxial and typically not spherically symmetric goes some way towards explaining the apparently high concentration parameters . using n - body simulations , clowe",
    ", de lucia & king ( 2004 ) demonstrated that halo triaxiality causes a scatter in the estimates of @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "oguri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that about 6% of cluster scale haloes can reproduce the profile of abell 1689 at the @xmath9 level , with the long axis very close to the line - of - sight .",
    "they note that consistency with their abell 1689 data falls to @xmath10 of clusters when spherically symmetric models are assumed as in broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , even taking the @xmath11 limits of the observations .",
    "in other clusters , triaxiality may more easily account for the value derived from observations when spherical symmetry has been assumed ( e.g. ms 2137 - 23 ; gavazzi 2005 ) .",
    "we estimate what impact physically close structures can have on cluster mass profiles determined in a weak lensing analysis , using simple nfw models for the primary cluster and for the additional haloes . in the next section",
    "we introduce the main principles behind the simulations described in section 3 .",
    "our results are summarised in section 4 , and we discuss our findings in section 5 .",
    "we focus on weak lensing , potentially by multiple haloes close to the line - of - sight . for a review of weak lensing , see bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) , and for a summary of multiple lens plane theory see for example schneider , ehlers & falco ( 1992 ) .",
    "we consider @xmath12 haloes each with an associated lens plane , at which deflection of light from a distant source occurs .",
    "the lens plane corresponding to the halo closest to the observer is the image plane , the observer s sky .",
    "the jacobian matrix of the lens mapping @xmath13 encapsulates the distortion induced by a gravitational lens ; after @xmath12 deflections @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the identity matrix and @xmath17 for the @xmath18th deflection .",
    "the convergence @xmath19 ( dimensionless surface mass density ) causes an isotropic magnification and the ( complex ) shear @xmath20 introduces a distortion . for the @xmath21th lens , the intermediate jacobian matrix is @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the angular diameter distances between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where o , s , @xmath18 and @xmath21 denote the observer , source , @xmath18th lens and @xmath21th lens respectively",
    ".    for example , 3 lens planes would result in a jacobian matrix @xmath27    for structures physically close to the main cluster lens @xmath28 is small ( this is quantified below ) , so in that case we immediately drop terms which are of higher order than linear in @xmath28 . furthermore , since we are concerned with weak lensing where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , only the linear terms in @xmath31 need be retained . thus the jacobian matrix in ( 1 ) simplifies to @xmath32 the determinant of which yields the magnification @xmath33 and where the effective shear and convergence are simply @xmath34    the shape and orientation of a weakly lensed galaxy projected on the sky is written as a complex ellipticity @xmath35 , with modulus @xmath36/[1+(b / a)]$ ] where @xmath37 is the axis ratio , and with a phase which is twice the position angle .",
    "this apparent ellipticity is related to the source ellipticity @xmath38 and reduced shear , @xmath39 , by @xmath40 where * denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the lensed and unlensed ellipticity probability distributions are related through @xmath41 and the expectation value for the lensed ellipticity on a patch of sky @xmath42 ( e.g. schramm & kayser 1995 ) .",
    "this is the basis of using the shapes of distant galaxies to constrain lens models .",
    "the number counts of galaxies are also changed : although a lens magnifies a source , an element of area is also changed by lensing .",
    "a nice description of this competition between effects can be found in canizares ( 1982 ) .",
    "this magnification effect results in local lensed number counts @xmath43 being related to the unlensed counts @xmath44 and to the slope of these counts @xmath45 by @xmath46",
    ".    a particular family of parametrized lens models is described by a set of parameters @xmath47 ( @xmath6 and @xmath5 in the case of an nfw model ) .",
    "the values of these parameters which best fit the observed @xmath48 lensed galaxy ellipticities ( galaxy @xmath18 at position @xmath49 having ellipticity @xmath50 ) are obtained by minimizing the shear log - likelihood function ( schneider , king & erben 2000 ; king & schneider 2001 ; king , schneider & springel 2002 ) : @xmath51",
    "the simulations involve lensing populations of galaxies at @xmath52 using various composite lenses , comprising a cluster at @xmath53 and nearby structures .",
    "the best - fitting parameters for _ single _ lenses which would give rise to the simulated catalogues are obtained by application of a maximum likelihood technique , minimizing ( 11 ) .",
    "the background source redshift is typical of the mean of source galaxies in weak lensing studies - the actual redshift _ distribution _ becomes important only for lenses at @xmath54 ( e.g. seitz & schneider 1997 ) when the lensing effectiveness is more sensitive to source redshift .",
    "galaxies are randomly distributed on the sky over a 30field , with gaussian distributed intrinsic ellipticities having dispersion @xmath55 .",
    "a number density of 30 galaxies / arcmin@xmath56 is used , characteristic of ground - based observations , and poisson noise is accounted for .",
    "the slope of the number counts is taken to be @xmath57 for the purposes of incorporating source depletion due to magnification .",
    "each component of the composite lens is modeled using an nfw halo ; the convergence and shear for this are given by e.g. bartelmann ( 1996 ) .",
    "our fiducial primary cluster has @xmath58 , and throughout the total mass is fixed at @xmath59 .",
    "the values of nfw concentration parameters for the primary @xmath60 and secondary structures @xmath61 are consistent with profiles of haloes formed in simulations ( e.g. nfw ; eke , navarro & steinmetz 2001 ) .",
    "we assume a @xmath62 cosmology with matter density parameter @xmath63 , cosmological constant @xmath64 , and a hubble constant @xmath65 .",
    "although we focus on weak lensing , the strong lensing region towards the centre of our fiducial lens sheds light on the behaviour of various quantities of importance . as a function of distance from",
    "the centre @xmath66 , fig.[qs ] shows @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( mean convergence inside @xmath66 ) and @xmath70 . for a circularly symmetric profile ,",
    "the solutions of * det*@xmath71 ( where @xmath72 formally diverges ) show that the tangential critical curve occurs when @xmath73 and the radial critical curve when @xmath74 .",
    "the einstein radius is strongly dependent on @xmath6 for a given virial mass : for our 10@xmath75 halo , when @xmath76 , @xmath77 and when @xmath78 , @xmath79 .    for a secondary structure at z=0.22 ( 0.24 ) , from ( 4 ) the parameter @xmath80 ;",
    "coupled with the fact that we work in the weak lensing regime this confirms our choice to use ( 6)-(10 ) from above . to retain generality",
    "it is assumed that the various structures are at the same redshift ; the impact of offset redshifts is considered separately at the end of the next section .",
    "for each lens discussed in this subsection , 500 catalogues of lensed galaxies ( with random positions and ellipticities , @xmath81 ) were generated , and best - fitting parameters recovered through the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the data were taken from the weak lensing regime , estimated in practice either from the shear or the location of giant arcs .",
    "if all the mass , @xmath82 , is contained within the primary cluster @xmath58 , there is a scatter in recovered parameters as illustrated in fig.[simuls ] .",
    "if space - based observations were available , the scatter would be decreased due to the ( factor of a few ) increase in the number of sources useful for a lensing analysis ( see king & schneider ( 2001 ) for treatment of individual nfw haloes ) .     of ( i ) the reduced shear @xmath83 , ( ii ) magnification @xmath72 , ( iii ) mean convergence @xmath69 ( = 1 at tangential critical curve ) , for our fiducial nfw lens ( @xmath76 , @xmath84 m@xmath85 ) .",
    "the function @xmath70 is also plotted ( iv ) ; this gives the location of the radial critical curve .",
    "the lens is at @xmath53 and sources are at @xmath52.,width=288 ]    next consider one secondary halo directly aligned along the line of sight , having 10% of the total mass , and with @xmath86 .",
    "fig.[simuls ] shows the best - fitting @xmath5 and @xmath6 when a single component nfw model is fit to the lensing data .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is quite close to the @xmath87 mass in the system - of course over - estimating the mass of the primary cluster since lensing is sensitive to the _ projected _ mass .",
    "of particular note is that the best - fitting @xmath6 is much larger than @xmath60 . increasing the mass of the secondary structure so that it contains 20% of the total mass exacerbates the trend towards high values of @xmath6 .",
    "similar , more extreme , effects are found when we consider @xmath88 . for precisely aligned haloes , a less massive secondary structure ( with a higher concentration parameter )",
    "biases the mass estimate of the cluster ( or even of the system as a whole ) , and more importantly results in a higher estimate of @xmath6 . for a composite lens",
    "the best - fitting single nfw model parameters are those with a reduced shear most consistent with the probability distribution of lensed ellipticities .",
    "similar to the case of a single lens , noise results in a scatter , and there is a clear degeneracy direction along which models have very similar @xmath83 , as seen in fig.[simuls ] .",
    "so the key to understanding why a structure which contains a small fraction of the mass of the system should drive @xmath6 to a larger or smaller value is simply the behaviour of @xmath89 over the radial range considered for analysis .    in fig.[simuls ] we also show the best - fitting models when two haloes , each containing 10% of the mass , and each with @xmath61=10 are along the line - of - sight to the primary halo .",
    "it is also interesting to divide the total mass @xmath90 into @xmath12 equal aligned haloes , in which case we find numerically that the best - fitting single nfw halo concentration parameter scales as @xmath91 , whereas the mass scales as @xmath92 .",
    "we now explore the impact on the best - fitting single halo nfw parameters when the alignment between a primary halo and secondary halo is no longer precise . at some point",
    ", the presence of a massive secondary may be apparent due to strongly lensed arcs , but these may be difficult to identify given confusion with arcs produced by the primary ( e.g. since substructure causes deviations from the regular tangential distortion associated with a smooth mass ) . for illustration",
    ", it is assumed that 20% of the mass is contained in a secondary halo , @xmath86 .",
    "fig.[unalign ] summarises the behaviour of the fit parameters as a function of separation ; since we are interested in how separation changes the fit , the same set of random galaxy positions and a small ellipticity dispersion ( @xmath93 ) is used for each case .    moving the secondary further away from the line - of - sight to the primary first of all results in a reduction in @xmath6 , when the misalignment is less than a couple of primary scale radii ( @xmath94 ) . beyond this , @xmath6 increases again , roughly until the secondary is completely outside @xmath95 of the primary .",
    "when the secondary leaves the field , @xmath6 tends to 5 as expected .",
    "the mass estimate also tends to that of the primary , 0.8@xmath96 at this point .",
    "again , over a range of component separations , the mass is both over- and under - estimated .",
    "the overall quality of fit is indicated in the bottom panel of fig.[unalign ] ; since the log - likelihood associated with a fit depends on factors such as the number density of galaxies , ellipticity dispersion and properties of the lenses , we use a scale such that the a fit to a single isolated halo gives a deviation in fit quality of 0 , and the poorest fit case ( at intermediate separations ) gives a deviation of 1 .",
    "the halo redshift enters into the critical surface mass density for lensing , and into the critical density of the universe ( through the hubble parameter @xmath97 ) at that epoch which relates @xmath95 to @xmath5 .",
    "for aligned haloes , taking @xmath98 and @xmath86 with 20% of the total mass results in less than a few % shift in @xmath6 and in @xmath99 , reinforcing the generality of our results for various lens configurations in redshift .     and",
    "mass @xmath100 for best - fitting single nfw haloes to ( i ) single fiducial halo ( * ) , ( ii ) 10% of mass in secondary halo , @xmath86 ( x ) , ( iii ) same as ( ii ) but with 20% in secondary halo ( + ) , ( iv ) 10% of mass in each of two @xmath88 haloes ( @xmath101 ) . each point within a group corresponds to a different noise realisation of random unlensed galaxy positions and ellipticities.,width=278 ]     ( upper panel ) and mass @xmath100 ( middle panel ) to the weak lensing data from a composite lens ( see text for details ) as a function of projected component separation @xmath66 . for each data point , the positions and ellipticities of the unlensed background galaxy population are fixed .",

    "the quality of fit is indicated in the bottom panel : 0 is the fit achieved with the primary component in isolation and 1 is the poorest fit at intermediate separations.,title=\"fig:\",width=278 ]",
    "in this paper we have briefly addressed the extent to which secondary haloes close to massive galaxy clusters impact on their weak lensing mass profiles .",
    "we use simple models for the cluster and for the secondary haloes , simulate lensing through these and determine the best - fitting single nfw halo parameters .",
    "we focus on low mass ratios , to estimate the maximum impact on the lensing analysis .",
    "non - linear structures close to the line - of - sight to a more massive cluster _ do _ have an impact on the estimated profile and mass of the cluster .",
    "it is difficult to attribute the very high reported values of @xmath6 to one secondary unbound halo , although this is more effective when @xmath61 is high and the mass ratio is low .",
    "for example , fig.[unalign ] shows that for a system of @xmath2 , with @xmath58 , @xmath86 and 20% of the mass contained in the secondary , the alignment has to be better than an arcminute to give an estimated @xmath6 which exceeds @xmath60 by at least 10% .",
    "more progress can however be made by having multiple haloes close to the line - of - sight . besides over - estimating @xmath6",
    "when the alignment is fairly precise , over a wide range of separations of a primary and secondary , @xmath6 can also be _",
    "under_-estimated , as shown in fig.[unalign ] .",
    "since a single nfw halo is fit to the data , the quality of the fits is better whenever there is close alignment , becomes poorer as the separation increases , improves again as the secondary starts to leave the data field , and returns to the same quality as the fit to a single halo whenever the secondary is well outside the data field .    a point which will be addressed in further work is the probability distribution for _ observed _ values of @xmath6 from our models .",
    "perhaps the observed distribution of lenses is skewed towards those with components in close alignment to the line - of - sight ( with a higher surface mass density and higher lensing efficiency ) - thus though @xmath6 may be biased high only over a small range of projected separations , as noted in the previous paragraph , there would be a bias towards these lenses .",
    "also , since @xmath6 is likely to be under - estimated when there is an additional structure outside the central regions of the primary halo , there is a greater chance that extra strong lensing features due to it would be recognised , or that a mass reconstruction would at some point detect it .",
    "we have tested the efficiency of the latter , and it strongly depends on the mass ratio and separation of the structures , as well as galaxy number density .",
    "additionally , the fit of a single halo would be poor in that regime ( see fig.[unalign ] ) as noted in the previous paragraph .",
    "it has been shown that triaxiality can go some way towards accounting for high values of @xmath6 ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2005 ; oguri et al .",
    "2005 ) , and in a forthcoming paper we explore the properties of this class of model in detail ( corless & king in prep . ) .",
    "another consideration is that real clusters are typically compared with those formed in dark matter simulations - neglecting the impact of baryons .",
    "cosmological simulations including gas dynamics , star formation and radiative cooling show that dark matter halo profiles are expected to become more concentrated as gas cools in their inner regions ( e.g. gnedin et al . 2004 ) . to triaxiality and baryonic physics",
    "we add unbound structures in close alignment with the main halo as a possible contributor to observed inconsistency with expectations . a general caveat : in interpreting departure from nfw in individual clusters as a sign of failure of the cdm paradigm , it should be remembered that many well studied cluster lenses are among the 30% of cases referred to by jing ( 2002 ) which are not relaxed , isolated systems - and therefore not necessarily expected to be well described by an nfw profile , even after baryonic physics has been accounted for .    in the context of abell 1689 , it is consistent with the available lensing and spectroscopic data ( see for example the compilation in lokas et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) that the field consists of a main triaxial halo whose long axis is close to the line - of - sight ( as suggested by oguri et al .",
    "2005 ) and other haloes close to the line - of - sight to it ( which might also be similarly oriented ) .",
    "the positions of the galaxies in the structures at different velocities overlap on the plane of the sky , indicating that they are along the line - of - sight ( lokas et al .",
    "2006 ) . from the currently available spectroscopic data , it is difficult to say how precise the alignment is between these structures .",
    "however , andersson & madejski ( 2004 ) noted the coincidence in x - ray observations between a high - redshift gas region approximately 1@xmath102 offset from the main cluster and a grouping of optically identified high redshift giant ellipticals .",
    "since the einstein radius of abell 1689 is larger than that of our fiducial cluster , this degree of alignment would be in the regime which would result in an over - estimate of @xmath6 .",
    "more detailed dynamical modeling and estimation of the masses of the structures in the abell 1689 field will be possible using new spectroscopy ( in excess of 500 cluster members ) taken by czoske ( 2004 ) .",
    "in general , such samples with large numbers of galaxies and well defined selection criteria will prove very useful in building up a 3-d picture of galaxy clusters , when combined with gravitational lensing and x - ray studies .",
