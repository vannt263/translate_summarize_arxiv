    "the first direct measurement of the proton structure function @xmath7 performed by the h1 collaboration at hera is presented .",
    "it is based on the measurement of the inclusive neutral current ( nc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross section which is given at low @xmath8 by : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the bjorken variable which in the quark parton model ( qpm ) corresponds to the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark , @xmath8 is the negative four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath11 is the inelasticity and @xmath12 is the center of mass energy squared .",
    "the direct measurement of the proton structure function @xmath5 at hera is based on the measurement of the reduced cross section ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : redxsec ] ) at the same values of @xmath10 and @xmath8 by varying the inelasticity @xmath13 .",
    "this is achieved by changing the proton beam energy @xmath14  gev while keeping the positron beam energy of @xmath15  gev constant which leads to a variation of the center of mass energy . the reduced dis cross section @xmath16 is measured in the range @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the structure function @xmath5 is determined from linear fits to the @xmath16 as a function of @xmath19 using statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the measurements of the structure function @xmath5 are performed as function of @xmath10 and @xmath8 as shown in fig .",
    "[ bapic1 ] .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the expectations from the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) confirming a dominant gluon contribution at low @xmath10 .",
    "jet production is directly sensitive to @xmath6 and allows for a precision test of qcd . the inclusive jet , 2-jet and 3-jet cross sections , normalized to the nc dis cross section are measured in the range of @xmath20 and @xmath21 by the h1 collaboration .",
    "particles of the hadronic final state are clustered into jets using the inclusive @xmath22 algorithm with the @xmath23 recombination scheme and with the distance parameter @xmath24 in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "the normalized inclusive cross sections are compared with the nlo calculations and recently published measurements by h1 based on hera  i data .",
    "the strong coupling @xmath6 is extracted from fits of the nlo prediction to the individual jet measurements as well as their combination .",
    "the experimental uncertainty of @xmath6 is defined by the change in @xmath6 which gives an increase of one unit in @xmath26 with respect to the minimal value .",
    "the dominating source for the theoretical error is the renormalization scale dependence reflecting the effect of missing orders beyond nlo in the pqcd prediction .",
    "the strong coupling is extracted from the combined jet measurements as @xmath27 .     measured using hera  i+ii data compared to the hera",
    "i published data .",

    "the differential dijet cross sections in diffractive photo - production @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) have been measured .",
    "the event topology is given by the system @xmath31 , containing at least two jets , separated from a leading low - mass proton dissociative system @xmath32 by large rapidity gap .",
    "if factorization holds the process can be described by the qcd calculable hard subprocess and diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdf ) .",
    "this factorization can be broken in resolved processes , where the additional photon remnant and proton are expected to fill the large rapidity gap and destroy the experimental diffractive signature .",
    "the measurements are performed in two kinematic ranges differing in the transverse energy requirements on the two hardest jets .",
    "the diffractive dijet events for both direct and resolved processes are compared to the expectation in fig .",
    "[ bapic5 ] , where the measurements are shown normalized to the cross sections .",
    "the nlo calculations predict larger cross sections than the data . the suppression of the data relative to calculation is found not to have a significant dependence on the photon four - momentum fraction @xmath33 entering the hard subprocess , while a dependence of the suppression factor on the transverse energy of the jets is suggested .",
    "the inclusive production of @xmath34 mesons has been measured in the kinematic region of small photon virtuality @xmath35 ( photo - production ) and high photon virtuality @xmath36 ( dis ) .",
    "the dominant heavy flavor production process is photon gluon - fusion ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "charm events are tagged via full reconstruction using the decay chain @xmath38 . the @xmath34 production measured in the photo - production events",
    "is compared to the prediction of cascade 1.2@xcite and pythia 6.2@xcite where the charm quarks are treated as massive ( massless ) particles .",
    "cascade 1.2 describes the shape of @xmath39 , but is too low in normalization .",
    "the expectations of pythia 6.2 are too steep as can be seen in fig  [ bapic3 ] . the @xmath34 production in the dis events",
    "is compared to the nlo calculation hvqdis and shows remarkably good agreement as shown in fig .",
