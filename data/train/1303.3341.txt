    "coding theory , the study of designing efficient codes that help in reliable data transmission , is an integral component of any communication system . the basic idea is to  encode \" the @xmath0-ary message to be transmitted by adding redundant information to immunize against errors and  decode \" at the receiver thereby achieving reliability .",
    "one way to encode is by linearly embedding the @xmath1 bit message space @xmath2 into @xmath3 and transmit the vectors in the image of the embedding .",
    "we call the image a _ code _ and the vectors in it _ codewords_. _ minimum distance _",
    "@xmath4 , the minimum number of positions in which any two distinct codes differ , is an important parameter of a code that measures its error correcting capability .",
    "typically , we need codes with relative parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be as large as possible .",
    "in fact , one of the important problems in coding theory is to construct a sequence of codes with @xmath7 such that the limit @xmath8 of relative parameters is non - zero .",
    "such a sequence of codes is called a sequence of _ good codes_.    it is well known that the maximal achievable @xmath9 for a given @xmath10 , denoted as @xmath11 , is a continuous decreasing function of @xmath10 .",
    "although the exact function @xmath11 is not known , there are many lower bounds for it .",
    "one significant bound is the _ gilbert - varshamov _ bound which was known to be the best until _ algebraic geometric codes _ were discovered .",
    "these codes are constructed by picking rational points on smooth projective curves and evaluating global sections of a line bundle at these points .",
    "the parameters of these codes are easily estimated using the riemann - roch theorem and good parameters can be obtained by choosing good curves with many rational points .",
    "one such example of a family of good curves is the family of _ modular curves_. these curves have a lot of rational points thereby yielding a good family of codes that beat the gilbert - varshamov bound .",
    "one can generalize the construction of codes on curves to codes on surfaces or any other higher dimensional variety in an anologous manner : pick a set of @xmath12 rational points on the variety and evaluate the global sections of a line bundle at these points to get a linear code . in this case , estimating the parameters of the code is harder than in the case of curves as we need riemann - roch in higher dimensions .",
    "however , one possible direction to tackle the problem is to realise the codes on the varieties as codes on curves whose parameters can be estimated easily .",
    "we show that codes on higher dimensional varieties can be realised as codes on curves .",
    "this can be done using a theorem of poonen s  @xcite .",
    "although there are papers @xcite that use poonen s theorem to obtain results on algebraic geometric codes , there does not seem to be any literature that states this result .",
    "an interesting corollary of this method is that , since every algebraic geometric code on a higher dimensional variety can be realised as a code on some curve , good codes that are achievable through higher dimensional varieties are achievable through curves and hence we can restrict our focus on curves in our search for good codes and the codes that beat existing bounds .",
    "an _ @xmath13-code _ is a @xmath1-dimensional subspace of an @xmath14-dimensional vector space over @xmath12 .",
    "the vectors in a code are called _ codewords _ the parameter @xmath4 is called the _",
    "minium distance_. it is the minimum of hamming distances between any two distinct codewords .",
    "since a code is a linear subspace , it is also equal to the minimum of hamming weights of all the non - zero codewords . finding minimum distance given a basis for the code is np - hard . for practical purposes we need the dimension @xmath1 and the minimum distance @xmath4 of a code to be large as possible for a given length .",
    "so for an @xmath15 - code @xmath16 , we define the _ relative dimension _ or _ code rate _ , @xmath17 and _ relative minimum distance _ , @xmath18 .",
    "the pair @xmath19 denotes a point in @xmath20 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "a sequence of codes \\{@xmath21 } is said to be _ asymptotically good _ if @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "define , @xmath24 then , it is know that there is a _ continuous decreasing _",
    "function @xmath11 such that @xmath25 .",
    "the exact function @xmath11 is unknown although few upper and lower bounds for the function is known .",
    "one lower bound is given by the gilbert - varshamov(gv ) bound , @xmath26 , where + @xmath27 + it was the best known bound for many years until the invention of _ algebraic geometric ( ag ) codes _ which beat the gv bound .",
    "algebraic geometric codes were first dicovered by goppa @xcite and was further developed by many coding theorists and mathematicians along the way . in this section ,",
    "we follow the notations from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath28 be a smooth projective curve of genus @xmath29 over @xmath12 and let @xmath30 be a subset of @xmath12 points on @xmath28 .",
    "suppose @xmath31 is a divisor on @xmath28 such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath31 @xmath34 .",
    "we have the space of global sections given by    @xmath35 consider the _ evaluation map : _ @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the image of the map gives a linear code @xmath37 .",
    "( note : one can also get an `` equivalent code '' by choosing a trivialization and evaluating the global sections at the stalks).the parameters of this code satisfy @xmath38 where @xmath14 is the length of the code , @xmath1 its dimension and @xmath4 the minimum distance .    when @xmath39 , one can construct these codes on modular and drinfeld curves with good asymptotic behavior . in particular , we get the _ algebraic geometry ( ag ) bound _ ,",
    "@xmath40 which beats the gilbert - varshamov bound .",
    "the ag - bound beats the gv - bound in a region along @xmath10 for @xmath41 .",
    "we can imitate construction of codes on curves to get codes on higher dimensional smooth varieties by choosing a set of rational points and a line bundle together with a trivialization . in this case , estimating the parameters of the code is not so easy as we have to invoke riemann - roch in higher dimensions where the higher cohomology groups come into picture .",
    "however , we will show that the codes thus obtained can also be realised as codes on some curve of high enough degree .",
    "this curve comes from a result in poonen s paper  @xcite , which we recall for the convenience of the reader .",
    "let @xmath28 be a smooth projective geometrically integral variety of @xmath42 of dimension @xmath43 over @xmath12 , and let @xmath44 be a finite set of closed points .",
    "then , given any integer @xmath45 , there exists a smooth projective geometrically integral hypersurface @xmath46 of degree @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is smooth projective and geometrically integral of dimension @xmath49 and contains @xmath50 .",
    "consider @xmath51 over @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the set of all 7 @xmath52 points .",
    "then , the curve @xmath53 is a smooth curve passing through @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , one can show that there are 24 smooth curves of degree 4 passing through @xmath50 .",
    "suppose @xmath54 is a code on a geometrically integral smooth projective variety @xmath55 of dimension @xmath56 over @xmath12 .",
    "here @xmath57 is the corresponding line bundle and @xmath50 the corresponding subset of @xmath12-points .",
    "let @xmath48 be as above with degree @xmath4 of @xmath58 large enough .",
    "then , we have an exact sequence @xmath59 where @xmath60 . tensoring with @xmath57 we get @xmath61 this gives rise to a long exact sequence in cohomology on @xmath28 , @xmath62 by duality , we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the canonical sheaf on @xmath28 . since @xmath65 is ample , for large enough @xmath4 , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "vanishes and we get a canonical isomorphism obtained via restriction @xmath68      let @xmath28 be a smooth projective geometrically integral variety over the finite field @xmath12 and let @xmath57 be a line bundle on @xmath28",
    ". then there exists a smooth projective curve @xmath71 passing through a given set @xmath50 of @xmath12 points of @xmath28 and such that the restriction map @xmath73 is an isomorphism .",
    "this yields a code @xmath74 on @xmath71 which is the same as the code @xmath75 on @xmath28 .",
    "hence , given a code on a geometrically integral smooth projective variety , we have realised it over a smooth projective curve .",
