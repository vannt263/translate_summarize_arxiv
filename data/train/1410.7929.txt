    "the amount of kinetic energy transferred by a given star is a function of the contrast between its mass and the average mass of cluster stars , therefore depending on the mass function ( mf ) .",

    "<S> we present a study of the kinematics of the remote globular cluster ngc  5694 based on giraffe@vlt medium resolution spectra . </S>",
    "<S> a sample of 165 individual stars selected to lie on the red giant branch in the cluster color magnitude diagram was considered . using radial velocity and metallicity from calcium triplet </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to select 83 bona - fide cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of six previously known members leads to a total sample of 89 cluster giants with typical uncertainties @xmath0  km / s in their radial velocity estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the sample covers a wide range of projected distances from the cluster center , from @xmath1 to @xmath2 half - light radii ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find only very weak rotation , as typical of metal - poor globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion gently declines from a central value of @xmath4  km / s to @xmath5  km / s at @xmath6 , then it remainins flat out to the next ( and last ) measured point of the dispersion profile , at @xmath7 , at odds with the predictions of isotropic king models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both isotropic single - mass non - collisional models and multi - mass anisotropic models can reproduce the observed surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles .    </S>",
