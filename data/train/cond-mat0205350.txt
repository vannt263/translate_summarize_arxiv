    "quantum dots are man - made sub - micron structures in a solid , typically consisting of 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 atoms and a comparable number of electrons @xcite . in semiconductor quantum dots",

    "is formed by a heterostructure consisting of different semiconductor materials ( gaas / algaas ) .",
    "the free electrons are strongly confined to the interface between gaas and algaas , forming a 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "confinement in the other two dimensions is accomplished by locally depleting the 2deg , via etching techniques or metal gate electrodes .",
    "the resulting structure is weakly coupled to source and drain electrical contacts by tunnel barriers , connecting it to the outside world .",
    "+ an important element of electronic transport through quantum dots is coulomb blockade @xcite .",
    "an extra electron can only be added to the dot , if enough energy is provided to overcome the coulomb repulsion between the electrons .",
    "next to this purely classical effect , the confinement in all three directions leads to quantum effects that strongly influence electronic transport at low temperature .",
    "in particular it leads to the formation of a discrete ( 0d ) energy spectrum , resembling that of an atom .",
    "this and other similarities have therefore lead to the name artificial atoms for quantum dots @xcite .",
    "+ the next logical step after studying individual quantum dots is to study systems of more than one dot . where single quantum dots are regarded as ` artificial atoms ' , two quantum dots can be coupled to form an ` artificial molecule ' . depending on the strength of the inter - dot coupling , the two dots can form ionic - like ( weak tunnel coupling ) or covalent - like bonds ( strong tunnel coupling ) . in the case of ionic bonding",
    "the electrons are localized on the individual dots .",
    "the binding occurs , because a static redistribution of electrons leads to an attractive coulomb interaction .",
    "weakly , electrostatically coupled quantum dots with negligible inter - dot tunnel conductance are covered by orthodox coulomb blockade theory @xcite . in the case of covalent bonding , two electron states are quantum - mechanically coupled .",
    "the main requirement for covalent binding is that an electron can tunnel many times between the two dots in a phase - coherent way . here",
    "the electron can not be regarded as a particle that resides in one particular dot , but it must be thought of as a coherent wave that is delocalized over the two dots .",
    "the bonding state of a strongly coupled artificial molecule has a lower energy than the energies of the original states of the individual dots .",
    "this energy gain forms the binding force between the two dots .",
    "+ the theoretical possibility to perform certain tasks in a much more efficient way using a ` quantum computer ' instead of a ` classical computer ' , has stimulated the search for physical realizations of the basic building block of such a computer : the quantum bit . in principle , any quantum two - level system can be used as such a qubit . in particular ,",
    "recent studies have put forward double quantum dots as interesting candidates for realizing qubits @xcite .",
    "the possible application of double quantum dot devices in quantum logic forms an important motivation for this work .",

    "now there exists an extensive literature on experimental studies of electron transport through double lateral quantum dots coupled in series , and lateral double dots coupled in parallel .",
    "vertical double quantum dot structures fall outside the focus of this review .",
    "in vertical structures , the characteristics of the tunnel barriers are set by the growth parameters of the heterostructure , limiting the experimental tunability .",

    "+ as a first step to understanding double dot systems we introduce the stability diagram @xcite , or honeycomb diagram , in section [ stability ] .",
    "it is a convenient tool in the analysis of double dot transport properties .",
    "resonant tunneling experiments discussed in section [ restun ] , show that the resonant widths are only determined by the lifetime of the discrete energy states , independent of the electron temperature . in section [ magnetiz ]",
    "we discuss level spectroscopy in a magnetic field .",
    "the double dot geometry offers sufficient energy resolution to probe intra - dot level repulsion . in section [ spectro ]",
    "we present microwave spectroscopy measurements on a quantum dot molecule .",
    "we illustrate the transition from a weakly coupled double dot to a strongly coupled double dot , by discussing a two - level system in section [ 2level ] . although being a clear simplification , the mapping of the double dot on a two - level system grasps much of the physics of the experiments presented in section [ spectro ] . irradiation with microwaves leads to photon assisted tunneling ( pat ) ( sections [ weakcpat ] and [ strongcpat ] ) , which turns out to be a powerful tool not only to reveal the character of the inter - dot coupling , but also to quantitatively determine the bonding strength .",
    "in this section we introduce the stability  or honeycomb  diagram that visualizes the equilibrium charge states of two serially coupled dots .",
    "we start with a purely classical description in which the influence of discrete quantum states is not taken into account yet @xcite ( 9 ) , namely the numerator , ( @xmath2 ) . for @xmath3 ,",

    "the bias voltage , @xmath14 , is applied to the source contact with the drain contact grounded ( asymmetric bias ) . in this section",
    "we consider the linear transport regime , i@xmath6e@xmath6 @xmath15 .",
    "if cross - capacitances ( such as between @xmath16 and dot 2 ) , other voltage sources and stray capacitances are negligible , the double dot electrostatic energy reads ( a full derivation is given in the appendix )    @xmath17     + where @xmath18 is the charging energy of the individual dot 1(2 ) and @xmath19 is the electrostatic coupling energy .",

    "we will discuss the addition energy in the quantum regime , where also the spacing between discrete energy levels plays a role .",

    "we define the electrochemical potentials of the left and right leads to be zero if no bias voltage is applied , @xmath42 = @xmath43 = 0 .",
    "hence , the equilibrium charges on the dots are the largest values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for which both @xmath34    and @xmath44 are less than zero .",

    "if the coupling is increased , the domains become hexagonal ( fig@xmath6 [ honeycombs](b ) ) .",

    "by coupling two quantum dots in series , we obtain a system with fundamentally different behavior and possibilities in comparison to a single quantum dot . in this review",
    "we have discussed the superiority of a double quantum dot system in determining the intrinsic lifetime of quantum states and in probing intra - dot level repulsion .",
    "next to the added value as a spectroscopic instrument , the double dot manifests itself as an artificial molecule . by changing the inter - dot coupling ,",
    "we have been able to tune the double dot from an ionic - like bonded to a covalent - like bonded molecule .",
    "+ now that the ability to create and manipulate double quantum dots has been shown , the next challenge lies in the study and time - control of coherent phenomena in these systems .",
    "double quantum dots have been suggested as possible candidates for building blocks of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "we have shown that it is indeed possible to coherently couple dots , and that one can induce transitions between the extended states .",
    "the next crucial step towards quantum logic gates is to show that the coherence of the superposition is preserved on time scales much longer than the time needed for manipulating the electron wave functions .",
    "the time - resolved measurement of coherent charge oscillations in double quantum dots using pulsed gate voltages , will be an essential step in determining the dephasing time in these systems .",
    "+ in addition , the role of the electron spin and its relaxation and dephasing times ( @xmath245 and @xmath246 , respectively ) need to be characterized , as they are essential in the proposed quantum bit schemes based on coupled electron spins in double dots @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath245 in quantum dots has been experimentally shown to exceed 10 - 100 @xmath108s if the relaxation involves a spin - flip @xcite .",
    "the determination of the spin dephasing time @xmath246 , which is the most relevant timescale for quantum computing purposes , will be an experimental challenge for the near future .",
    "we conclude that our work on double dots so far , in combination with the results on the spin relaxation times in this kind of systems , forms a promising point of departure for further study on the suitability of double quantum dots as quantum coherent devices .",
