    "since the discovery of the j - band of pseudoisocyanine ( pic )  @xcite , the study of the collective optical properties of molecular aggregates has received much attention .",
    "the collective nature of the excitations gives rise to narrow absorption lines ( exchange narrowing ) and ultra - fast spontaneous emission .",
    "the development of novel optical techniques , a continuously increasing theoretical understanding of the optical response of these systems , and the realization that this type of excitations play an important role in natural light harvesting systems have kept these materials in the spotlight .    during the past 15 years",
    "a topic of particular interest has been the effect of multi - exciton states on nonlinear optical spectroscopies . amongst",
    "the latter are the nonlinear absorption spectrum @xcite , photon echoes @xcite , pump - probe spectroscopy @xcite , and two - dimensional spectroscopy @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", accounting for multi - exciton states requires the handling of large matrices , due to the extent of the associated hilbert space .",
    "it is well - known , however , that for homogeneous linear aggregates , three states dominate the third - order response , namely the ground state , the lowest one - exciton state and the lowest two - exciton state . in practice ,",
    "j - aggregates suffer from appreciable disorder , which leads to localization of the exciton states .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the three - state picture still holds to a good approximation , provided that one replaces the chain length by the typical exciton localization length .",
    "the existence of the so - called hidden structure of the lifshits tail of the density of states ( dos ) justifies this approach  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we put a firmer basis under the above idea , by systematically analyzing the dominant ground - state to one - exciton transitions and one- to two - exciton transitions in disordered linear aggregates . by comparison to exact spectra , we show that , indeed , the picture of three dominant states per localization segment holds .",
    "we model a single aggregate as a linear chain of @xmath0 coupled two - level monomers with parallel transition dipoles .",
    "we assume that the aggregate interacts with a disordered environment , resulting in random fluctuations in the molecular transition energies @xmath1 ( diagonal disorder ) , and restrict ourselves to nearest neighbor excitation transfer interactions @xmath2 .",
    "the optical excitations are described by the frenkel exciton hamiltonian , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 denotes the state with the @xmath5th site excited and all other sites in the ground state .",
    "the monomer excitation energies @xmath1 are modeled as uncorrelated gaussian variables with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath6 . for j - aggregates @xmath7 .",
    "numerical diagonalization of the hamilton yields the exciton energies @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and exciton wavefunctions @xmath10 of the one - exciton states , where @xmath11 is the @xmath5th component of the wavefunction @xmath12 .",
    "the two exciton states are given by the slater determinant of two different one - exciton states @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite : @xmath15 with @xmath16 the state in which the sites @xmath5 and @xmath17 are excited and all other sites are in the ground state .",
    "the corresponding two - exciton energy is given by @xmath18 .",
    "the physical size of a molecular aggregate can amount to thousands of monomers , but the disorder localizes the exciton states  @xcite . for j - aggregates",
    "a small number of states at the bottom of the one - exciton band contain almost all the oscillator strength .",
    "the states are localized on segments with a typical extension @xmath19 , called the localization length , which depends on the magnitude of the disorder  @xcite .",
    "the wavefunctions of these states overlap weakly and consist of ( mainly ) a single peak ( they have no node within the localization segment ) , see fig .  [",
    "fig : reduced wavefunctions ] . for the remainder of this paper",
    "we will refer to these states as @xmath20 states , and @xmath21 will denote the set of @xmath20 states .    from the complete set of wavefunctions we select the @xmath20 states using the selection rule proposed in ref .",
    ", @xmath22 . for a disorder - free",
    "the lowest state contains 81% of the total oscillator strength between the ground state and the one - exciton band  @xcite .",
    "numerically we found that the @xmath20 states selected by taking @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) together contain 76% of the total oscillator strength : @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the transition dipole moment from the ground state to the state @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption](a ) we show the absorption spectrum calculated only with the @xmath20 states and compare it to the exact spectrum .    we observe that the @xmath20 states give a good representation of this spectrum , except for its blue wing , where higher - energy exciton states , which contain one node within the localization segment , contribute as well  @xcite .",
    "these so - called @xmath28 states may be identified as the second one - exciton state on a localization segment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 states play a crucial role in the third - order response . in order to analyze this ,",
    "we have considered two - exciton states @xmath29 given by the slater determinant of a given @xmath20 state ( selected as described above ) with all other one - exciton states @xmath30 ( the two - exciton state consisting of two @xmath20 type states localized on different segments do not contribute to the nonlinear response ) , and calculate the corresponding transition dipole moments @xmath31 . from the whole set of @xmath31",
    ", we select the largest one , denoted by @xmath32 , were the substrict @xmath20 in @xmath33 indicates its relation with the state @xmath27 .",
    "it turns out that the one - exciton state @xmath34 selected in this way is localized on the same segment as the state @xmath27 .",
    "several of these doublets of @xmath20 and @xmath28 states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reduced wavefunctions](b ) .",
    "the partners of the lowest @xmath20 states indeed look like @xmath28 states , having a well - defined node within the localization segment .",
    "they form the hidden structure of the lifshits tail of the dos  @xcite we mentioned above . for higher lying @xmath20 states ,",
    "these partners ( not shown ) are more delocalized and often do not have a @xmath28-like shape .",
    "the average ratio of the oscillator strength of the transitions @xmath35 and @xmath36 turned out to be @xmath37 .",
    "for the dominant ground - to - one and one - to - two exciton transition in a homogeneous chain , this ratio reads @xmath38 .",
    "this comparison suggests that our selection of two - exciton states well captures the dominant one - to - two exciton transitions in disordered chains .",
    "we have also found that the energy separation between the states @xmath27 and @xmath34 obeys @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "this resembles the level spacing of a homogeneous chain : @xmath41 , confirming that the separation between the one - exciton bleaching peak and the one - to - two - exciton induced absorption peak may be used to extract the typical localization size from experiment  @xcite .    to illustrate how the selected transitions , involving the ( @xmath20,@xmath28 ) doublets , reproduce the optical response of the aggregate",
    ", we have calculated the pump - probe spectrum at zero temperature using only these transitions @xcite,@xmath42 and compared the result to the exact spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption](b ) .",
    "apart from a blue wing in the induced absorption part of the spectrum ( the positive peak ) , the selected transitions reproduce the exact pump - probe spectrum very well .",
    "in particular the separation between the bleaching and induced absorption peaks is practically identical to the exact one .",
    "we have shown that the third - order optical response of disordered linear j - aggregates is dominated by a very limited number of transitions . considering only these transitions",
    "enormously reduces the computational effort necessary to simulate nonlinear experiments .",
    "we have used the procedure outlined above to calculate the optical bistable response of a thin film of j - aggregates , taking into account the one - to - two exciton transitions @xcite ."
