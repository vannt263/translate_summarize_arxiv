    "in general continuum mechanics , effective fluxes in continuum scale are caused by the thermodynamic imbalance of microscopic nature within finite relaxation time , where the constitutive relations depend on the history of various physical properties .",

    ", the classical fluid mechanics , as a prototypical model of the continuum , has enjoyed its field - theoretic development due to simpler coordinate descriptions of the _ eulerian framework _ , since the pure viscous fluid , including the newtonian fluid , is an idealized model of infinitesimal relaxation time , where the history effect does not appear .    at the stage of turbulent flow",
    ", however , the turbulence motion causes finite relaxation time in the mean - field properties , requiring the reconsideration of history effect at the mean - field level .",
    "in addition , the covariance principle also survives in turbulence - constitutive relations as a rigorous requirement , which is an essential ingredient for the physical objectivity of the observable mean fields @xcite .",
    "these facts naturally motivate the fundamental reformulation of the turbulence theory in the lagrangian framework of the mean - field base , which may be referred as the _ mean - lagrangian framework _ hereafter .",
    "furthermore , a remarkable similarity between instantaneous- and mean - velocity fields are pointed out by recent @xcite ( termed as the _ v - v correspondence _ ) , stating that the mean velocity field plays equivalent roles to those of the instantaneous counterpart , which also supports the possibility of such mean - lagrangian reformulation .    in this paper",
    ", we clarify that the mean - lagrangian framework provides a firm mathematical basis suitable to the covariant formulation of the theory of fluid turbulence .",
    "space - time description elucidates the true equivalence between instantaneous- and mean - velocity fields , both of which appear as one - parameter groups ( vector flows ) of space - time .",
    "the proposed framework is applied to one - point closure model , which allows an explicit integration of the visco - elastic effect of the reynolds stress in generally covariant manner .",
    "application to the two - point closure is also considered , where we propose some new candidates of turbulence correlation allowed by the mean - lagrangian description , which include some generalizations of the conventional lagrangian quantities of @xcite .",
    "we observe the fluid motion in the space @xmath0 as time @xmath1 passes , which may be clearly illustrated by the 4-dimensional space - time formulation .",
    "we compose the space - time as the direct product @xmath2 , and express the space @xmath0 at each time @xmath3 as a 3-d hyper surface @xmath4 of @xmath5 . here",
    "we only discuss the non - relativistic limit , where the coordinate transformation does not change the time @xmath3 .",

    "now the coordinate transformation reads    @xmath30    which is identical to what is derived in @xcite .    in the above procedure",
    "we saw the derivation of the velocity field @xmath31 from the flow @xmath32 , which may be summarized that @xmath32 is the vector flow uniquely determined by the vector field @xmath33 .",
    "this one - to - one correspondence can be cast into the mean velocity ; another vector flow , say @xmath34 , exists for the mean velocity field . as far as @xmath31 of each realization",

    "unlike the original flow @xmath32 , there is no physically observable point convected by the mean flow , so @xmath34 introduces rather a _ virtual _ continuum . in spite of the absence of some observable continuum , we can construct the convective picture based on the mean flow without mathematical flaw . once we obtain the mean flow @xmath34 , its resulting properties should be equal to what follows from @xmath32 , which is the underlying truth of the @xmath33-@xmath44 correspondence of @xcite .",

    "note that both operations ( [ mconv der . ] ) and ( [ mconv int . ] ) provide generally covariant operations for general 3-d tensors , which trivially follows from the original ( [ conv der . ] ) and ( [ conv int . ] ) .",
    "likewise , due to equivalence between @xmath32 and @xmath34 , the mean - lagrangian framework offers objective operations in totally the same manner as the ordinary lagrangian framework .",

    "finally , it is notable that the above analysis consists for any models containing the rotta term , not only for the lrr model ( [ lrr ] ) .      the main stream of the multiple - points closure have been developed for the two - point quantities , where two - point correlations obey differential - integral equations ( the time integration are sometime simplified by the markovianization ) .",
