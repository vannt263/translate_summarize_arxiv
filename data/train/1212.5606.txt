    "with what seems to be the recent discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , the high energy physics enters into the solitude of a path that no one knows where or how it may found new physics ( np ) .",
    "although a light higgs requires either , fine - tuning , or np at the tev scale , the experimental results do not show any hint of new phenomena insofar . as a matter of fact , _ natural _ supersymmetry , which is one of the most popular theories to avoid fine - tuning and to simultaneously explain many other phenomena , is being highly constrained by direct searches at the lhc @xcite .    from a general theoretical point of view , one may expect to have np effects in the detailed study of the heavier particles properties .",
    "in particular , the top quark is the heaviest known particle and its properties have not been explored in depth insofar .",
    "in fact , last years results from tevatron @xcite seemed to point to np in the top forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "however , recent results from the top charge asymmetry at lhc @xcite , have contradicted most of the np proposals except for very few models @xcite that have survived .",
    "regardless of these recent results in top physics , in this article we consider the inclusive @xmath7 process where we study the @xmath8 invariant mass ( @xmath9 ) spectrum as a sensitive observable to np resonant phenomena .",
    "this is due to a potential enhancement in the coupling of the top quark to the np . in this work ,",
    "we address the question of how to increase the sensitivity of this observable in the case of np that couples to quarks and not to gluons .",
    "the reason for this study is that at the lhc most ( @xmath10 at @xmath11 tev and increasing with energy ) of the @xmath8 events have a gluon in the initial state partons and , therefore , a possible np as the stated above would be per - se diluted just because of the initial state partons of the event . for the sake of brevity , from this point",
    "forward we call gluon - fusion any event with at least one gluon in the initial state .    the goal of this article is to propose kinematic cuts which enrich the quark - annihilation fraction ( @xmath12 ) of a selected @xmath8 sample in order to increase the sensitivity to the stated np in the @xmath9-spectrum . moreover , in light of the upcoming experimental results , we focus our work to the @xmath13 tev region of energy . this range of energies has two special features which determine the results in this work : _",
    "i ) _ we propose to use as one of the variables to discriminate quark - annihilation events , the center of mass scattering angle , which is useful for this purpose at high @xmath9 ; and _ ii ) _ the lack of statistics at high @xmath9 requires a special selection criteria that with small cuts makes considerable increases in the sensitivity .",
    "this latter is in contrast to the low energy regime , where strong cuts that yield a very large increase in the sensitivity are sought .",
    "the search for kinematic cuts that increase @xmath12 in a given @xmath8 sample has been studied in the last years @xcite mainly to increase the sensitivity in the top charge - asymmetry at the lhc and very few in the @xmath9-spectrum @xcite .",
    "these articles deal mainly with two different features in the production mechanisms that allow to distinguish @xmath14 production in @xmath7 .",
    "the first one is that valence quarks inside the colliding protons tend to have larger fraction of the proton momentum than gluons and anti - quarks .",
    "therefore , top pairs produced through quark - annihilation tend to be boosted along the pipe line .",
    "this characteristic can be measured through the kinematic variable = , [ beta ] which ranges from @xmath15 for not boosted pairs to @xmath16 for maximum boosted pairs .",
    "notice for future purposes that the origin of this feature is in the proton parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the second feature which allows to isolate top pairs produced through quark - annihilation is that initial state gluons tend to produce more initial state radiation ( isr ) than quarks .",
    "this is an effect due to a larger numeric factor in the three gluon vertex in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "this characteristic can be measured through the transverse momentum of the top pair , p_t=| p_t(t ) + p_t(|t ) | .",
    "[ pt ] the larger is @xmath3 , the more probable is to have a gluon in the initial state .",
    "notice that , in this case , the origin of this feature is pure qcd and is independent not only from the pdf , but also from the dynamics in the @xmath8 production process . the usage of these two variables to increase the sensitivity to np in the @xmath9-spectrum has been exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is a third variable which may serve to distinguish quark - annihilation processes .",
    "this is the center of mass scattering angle ( @xmath4 ) of the top quark direction relative to the right moving parton .",
    "this variable has been previously studied in refs .",
    "since , as we show in the article , to take profit of this variable requires large @xmath9 , we use it to study the upcoming experimental results where the @xmath9 region above @xmath16 tev will be better analyzed .",
    "this variable is related to the dynamics of the @xmath17 process and the spin of the particles .",
    "the key feature in using the angular distribution is that for large @xmath9 the quark - annihilation processes have a smooth angular distribution , whereas gluon - fusion processes accumulate most of the events in the forward @xmath18 region . or ,",
    "to be more precise , the @xmath19-channel @xmath20 amplitude is the one that peaks the production in the forward region for relativistic tops .",
    "therefore , the angular distribution may also be understood as a discriminator of @xmath21- from @xmath19-channel contributions , as in dijet resonance searches @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze simultaneously cuts in all three variables ( @xmath22 and @xmath4 ) to enhance the sensitivity to resonant np in the @xmath9-spectrum by increasing @xmath12 .",
    "notice that , although all three variables have different origins , they have some degree of indirect correlation through the pdf s . in any case",
    "due to their different origin none of them can be expressed as a function of the other two .",
    "the price to pay for increasing @xmath12 is to reduce the fraction of the original sample ( @xmath23 ) that is selected for the analysis .",
    "this reduction , which always yields an increase in the statistical uncertainty , may not worth the selection .",
    "the critical point up to where it is convenient to cut the sample depends on how @xmath12 and the total uncertainty behave as a function of @xmath23 . henceforth , it is crucial at this point also to take into account systematic uncertainties in the analysis in order to know if the selection cut is useful or not .",
    "however , since a full realistic simulation of the systematic uncertainty would require a detailed simulation of the detector , which is beyond the scope of this work , we use a simpler model which is enough to lead us to the desired interplay between @xmath12 , @xmath23 and statistic and systematic uncertainties in order to decide whether the selection is suitable or not .    under this scenario , for the setup of the problem and its solution",
    ", it will be enough to consider @xmath17 processes up to parton level including isr .",
    "hadronization , detector simulation and reconstruction would be useful only if one could perform a fully realistic detector simulation including its systematic uncertainties .",
    "this is left for the experimental groups in case they consider to follow the guidelines in this work .",
    "the purpose of this article is to show that exists an interplay between a selection cut on the three variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the statistic and systematic uncertainties , that yields an optimal cut which enhances the sensitivity of the @xmath9-spectrum to np that couples to quarks .",
    "we show along the article that this interplay , and therefore also the optimal cut , is strongly dependent on the energy of the process and the accumulated luminosity .",
    "for instance , we show that for the 2012 lhc data , as the energy increases beyond @xmath24 tev , strong cuts in @xmath2 should be gradually replaced by mild cuts in @xmath4 .",
    "this article is divided as follows . in next section",
    "we present the analytic results for the angular distributions in the standard model ( sm ) for quark - annihilation and @xmath25-fusion .",
    "we also study angular distribution of np models which couple to quarks and not to gluons . in section 3",
    ", we study the parton level variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 and their interplay with @xmath12 and @xmath23 , as well as the relationships of these two with the uncertainties . in section 4 , we present an example of a resonant np in @xmath8 production and show how the progressive cuts in the studied variables leads to the visibility of the resonant bump .",
    "section 5 contains a discussion on the results and previous works , and section 6 the conclusions .",
    "in this section we study analytically the leading order @xmath8 production through the processes @xmath26 and @xmath20 within the sm and for different possible resonant np models . at high energy , events initiated by quarks have different angular distributions than those initiated by gluons .",
    "this is due to the @xmath25-fusion amplitude where a top is exchanged in the @xmath19-channel producing @xmath8 pairs mainly in the forward region .",
    "therefore , one may impose kinematic cuts to the relevant angular variables in order to disentangle contributions from the two different production modes .",
    "we begin analyzing the angular distribution of the two production mechanisms within sm .",
    "the expressions for the production squared amplitudes are given in the helicity basis in the initial parton center of mass frame .",

    "have been used to separate np and sm @xmath26 production from the @xmath20 background .",
    "first , we discuss in this section some differences among the present analysis that makes focus on @xmath4 as a suitable kinematic variable and previous studies where the rapidity @xmath117 is used to impose tight selection cuts . and finally , we discuss briefly about the different regimes where @xmath4 cuts and spin correlation are useful to improve the @xmath12 fraction .    it is well known that there is a correlation between the center of mass angle @xmath4 and the difference of rapidity @xmath118 , y = , where @xmath119 . the partonic energy",
    "@xmath120 entering this relation may dilute the correlation between this two variables . only if @xmath30 is fixed , there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath4 and @xmath121 . however ,",

    "therefore , for a high @xmath9 bin , cuts on @xmath4 and @xmath121 are roughly equivalent . moreover ,",
    "if we take several bins in the high @xmath9 region , for the same cut on @xmath4 , we will have a different ( but equivalent ) cut on @xmath121 in each bin . on the other hand , close to the threshold ,",
    "@xmath30 varies greatly and the correlation is more diluted .",
    "thus , within the 400 - 425 gev bin , @xmath121 varies up to @xmath78 for fixed values of @xmath4 .",
    "cuts on @xmath123 have already been considered in the literature @xcite . however , they have been applied at low energies and for certain class of models .",
    "for instance , in @xmath124 flavor violating models , @xmath8 are produced through the exchange of the @xmath124 in the @xmath19-channel and then it produces @xmath8 events mostly in the forward region .",
    "this situation , which does not correspond to resonant np , is quite the opposite to the present analysis . for such models",
    ", it has been shown that a lower cut on @xmath123 enhances the sensitivity to the new interactions .",
    "since these interactions arise at low @xmath9 , there is not a considerable increment of the gluon - fusion fraction that may spoil the enhancement generated by the new interactions . in cases where the new physics contributions are significant at higher @xmath9",
    ", we have to deal with an interplay between increasing the np @xmath19-channel contribution and decreasing the sensitivity with the increment of the gluon - fusion @xmath8 production .",
    "the rapidity has also been used in the context of the charge asymmetry in @xmath8 production at the lhc @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the basic idea is also to discriminate quark - annihilation from @xmath25-fusion events by imposing different cuts on @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the procedure traces the discrimination back to the correlation between @xmath117 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , the angular variable @xmath4 ( or @xmath121 ) plays no role in that method .",
    "finally , for many of the models that have been proposed to accommodate the @xmath127 , there exist a high @xmath9 resonance that induces an interference at low @xmath9 , for instance , a heavy axigluon that has been integrated out @xcite .",
    "therefore , the new physics contribution arise at low @xmath9 and this may seem to be the reason why @xmath4 has never been taken as a relevant kinematic variable in previous studies .",
    "spin correlations in the production and decay of tops have been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "the aim of those studies is to compare predictions made within the sm or its extensions with the measured angular distributions of the decay products of @xmath19 and @xmath29 . in general ,",
    "different models give place to distinct angular distribution patterns and the measurement of spin correlations may provide additional and relevant information on the structure of possible new interactions .",
    "such spin correlations are optimized when the asymmetry between like- and unlike - helicities reaches certain maximum value . usually , for a given axis from which the spin projection is defined ,",
    "one seeks to perform kinematic cuts that increase this asymmetry .",
    "this in turn allows to discriminate like- and unlike - helicities .    from eqs .",
    "( [ qqll])-([gglr ] ) and their corresponding discussion in section 2 we have learned that angular distribution for both quark - annihilation and @xmath25-fusion production mechanisms are essentially flat close to the threshold .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 cuts can not be used to improve the quark - annihilation fraction . on the contrary , a distinction based on spin correlation is envisaged since only like - helicity @xmath20 production is possible whereas the two spin production mechanism are present for @xmath26 as we can see from the eqs .",
    "( [ qqll])-([gglr ] ) .",
    "the opposite situation we encounter at large @xmath9 . there , only unlike - helicity",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath20 production mechanisms are possible , being hardly expected that spin correlation being useful to distinguish quark - annihilation from @xmath25-fusion production contrary to @xmath4 cuts that has been proven to be suitable to increase the quark - annihilation fraction .",
    "we have studied the collider phenomenology of @xmath8 resonance searches above 1 tev at 30 fb@xmath1 . we have focused our analysis on resonances that couple exclusively to quarks which , at the lhc , would be naturally hidden behind the large gluon - fusion @xmath0 production .",
    "the usual variables to enlarge the quark - annihilation fraction @xmath12 of a @xmath8 sample are the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the @xmath8 pair , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "in addition to these variables , we exploit the fact that for masses above 1 tev the large boost of the tops in the center of mass system yields a correlation between their center of mass scattered angle @xmath4 and the initial partons of the event ( this correlation is suppressed for invariant masses below 1 tev ) . since the origin of the relationship between the initial state partons and @xmath2 is the proton pdf , whereas for @xmath3",
    "is the initial state radiation , and for @xmath4 the dynamics of the partonic collision , there are not a priori reasons to expect these variables to be considerably correlated , and all three should be used together to texture the initial state partons of an event .",
    "we have simulated @xmath8 production in the large invariant mass regime and scanned over different set of cuts on the variables mentioned above to increase the quark - annihilation fraction of the sample . given a set of invariant mass bins where the np resonance could be expected",
    ", the optimal cut is the one that enhances the most the significance of a resonance search over the sm background .",
    "this is achieved when a set of cuts increases @xmath12 while keeping the selected fraction @xmath23 still large since , for resonances beyond 1 tev , a critical reduction in the amount of events could spoil the signal due to an increase of the statistical uncertainties .",
    "our results show that @xmath2 is not as useful as expected in this resonance search .",
    "the reason for this is that this variable requires tight cuts in order to yield significant increases in @xmath12 , and there are not too many events in the large invariant mass bins in the 2012 data . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath4 does not reach large values of @xmath12 , but it has an important increase as one begins cutting the sample .",
    "hence , the reasons why @xmath4 is useful in the large invariant mass bins are two - folded : the variable requires relativistic tops to distinguish the initial state partons , and in this region the cuts should be moderate . at last ,",
    "the cut in @xmath3 is always useful for any invariant mass bin .",
    "we have studied a reference case of a @xmath94 tev resonance and found that the optimal cuts in these three parton level variables is in agreement with the previous sections analyses .",
    "we have also shown how the significance of the resonance search behaves as one gradually includes all variables in the selection cuts .",
    "summarizing , when we include all three variables , we found that @xmath2 is not relevant , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 provide the most useful cuts to enhance the significance of the resonance search .",
    "the results in this article are a guideline to point the searches of np resonances above 1 tev for 30 fb@xmath1 at a center of mass energy of @xmath81 tev .",
    "it is important to stress the perspectives for upcoming luminosity and energy increases .",
    "for np resonances coupled to quarks and masses above 1 tev , a rise in the luminosity will make @xmath4 remain as a useful variable , whereas @xmath2 will improve as a quark - annihilation discriminator too . on the other hand , a rise of the center of mass energy ,",
    "will allow the exploration of heavier resonances within this framework .",
