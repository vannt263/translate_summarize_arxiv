    "the electromagnetic structure of hadrons is characterized by a set of electromagnetic form factors ( ffs ) , which are functions of one variable , the four momentum transfer squared , @xmath3 .    since the pioneering work of hofstadter @xcite , a large number of experimental data",
    "have been collected about hadron electromagnetic ffs , especially in the space - like region .",
    "it is important to note that a relatively simple phenomenological parametrizations can be found for the description of the @xmath3 dependence of different ffs , despite the possible complicated dynamics which determines the hadronic electromagnetic structure .",
    "therefore , even without a complete understanding of the internal structure of the hadrons , simple analytical formulas have been suggested for the hadronic ffs .",
    "for example , in case of charged pion , the corresponding ff , @xmath4 , can be written as : @xmath5where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-meson mass , and @xmath8 in the space - like region .",
    "similar formulas have also been suggested for ffs of the electromagnetic transition @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a fitting parameter , which depends on the type of pseudoscalar meson .    for a long time , the nucleon electromagnetic ffs have been described by a very simple form : @xmath16/ 0.71 ] ^{-2},~g_{en}(q^2)=0 , \\label{eq : eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the magnetic moment of proton ( neutron ) .",
    "but the last experiments at the jefferson laboratory , using the polarization transfer method @xcite , showed a large deviation from parametrization ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) and the proton electromagnetic ffs have , instead , the following behavior @xcite : @xmath18}^2 - 0.04 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : eq4}\\ ] ] the experimental data about @xmath19 , obtained from quasielastic scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons by a polarized deuteron target , @xmath20 @xcite , and from the measurement of the neutron polarization in @xmath21 @xcite , show , indeed , that @xmath22 , with the following parametrization @xcite : @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the nucleon mass .    note that the analysis @xcite of all existing experimental data concerning elastic electron - deuteron @xmath26 scattering - the structure functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the deuteron tensor polarization - in framework of the impulse approximation , leads to comparable values of @xmath19 and @xmath29 at relatively large momentum transfer , @xmath30 gev@xmath31 .",
    "next in the list of simple parametrizations of hadronic electromagnetic ffs , we can mention that the magnetic ff for the transition @xmath32 , @xmath33 can also be parametrized in a simple form @xcite : @xmath34 finally , the nucleon axial ff , @xmath35 , for the transition @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the virtual @xmath38-boson ) , can be described by the following simple formula @xcite : @xmath39 with @xmath40 = 1.06 gev , if @xmath41 .",
    "these simple parametrizations are very useful for the discussion of different processes of elastic and inelastic scattering of electrons on nuclei at high energies .",
    "nevertheless , these parametrizations can not be considered a complete and precise description of the hadronic electromagnetic structure in the full region of momentum transfer ( space - like and time - like region as well ) .",
    "an evident example is that the parametrizations ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) suggested for the description of the nucleon structure in the space - like region , violate the relation @xmath42 , at @xmath43 , i.e. , at the threshold of the annihilation process @xmath44 .    to avoid this and other problems , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( updated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , another parametrization of nucleonic ffs has been suggested , which can be extended in the whole region of momentum transfer squared",
    ". the basic idea of this parametrization is the presence of two components in the nucleon structure , with different radii : the intrinsic structure , with radius @xmath45 fm ( updated 0.49 fm ) , characterized by a dipole ff ( which is the same for electric , magnetic , proton and neutron ffs ) and a meson cloud , ( which contains the @xmath7 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 contributions ) different for each of the four nucleon ffs .    in this paper",
    "we generalize this two - component picture to the case of deuteron electromagnetic ffs , with the aim to find a simple parametrization for all three ffs , at least in the region where they have been completely determined , for @xmath46 2 gev@xmath31 .",
    "this parametrization should be useful in corresponding calculations of deuteron electromagnetic processes , such as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 etc .",
    "any specific additional assumption about the validity of impulse approximation , the role and size of meson exchange currents , relativistic corrections , model ( relativistic or non relativistic ) of deuteron structure etc . is not needed .",
    "instead , we parametrize the three deuteron ffs in a simple form , with a small number of parameters , normalized for @xmath50 to the electric charge , the magnetic moment and the electric quadrupole moment of the deuteron . in order to decrease the number of independent parameters",
    ", we will use the experimental constraint of the position of the node for the electric and magnetic ffs .",
    "the matrix element for @xmath51 elastic scattering , for the one - photon approximation , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , can be written as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the four momenta of the initial and final electron , and @xmath55 is the electromagnetic current of the deuteron . applying the conservation of this current , the p and c invariance of the electromagnetic interaction of hadrons , we can write @xmath55 in the following general form @xcite : @xmath56- \\right .\\label { eq : cal}\\\\ & & ~~\\left .",

    "the deuteron invariant form factors @xmath61 , @xmath62 , are related to the charge , quadrupole and magnetic ffs by : @xmath63    the differential cross section for elastic electron deuteron scattering can be expressed in terms of two structure functions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which depend on the three electromagnetic ffs : @xmath64 ,    \\label{eq : eq10}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 $ ] is the mott cross section . here",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 are the incident and scattered electron energies , @xmath68 is the electron scattering angle , @xmath69 is the four - momentum transfer squared and @xmath70 is the fine structure constant , @xmath71 .",
    "the elastic electric and magnetic structure functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are written in terms of the charge , quadrupole and magnetic ffs @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 as : @xmath75 in order to determine the three ffs , one needs another observables , usually the component @xmath76 of the tensor polarization of the recoil deuteron , in an unpolarized collision , which contains the following combination of the three ffs : @xmath77g_m^2\\right \\},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 .",
    "the existing data on the differential cross section @xcite and @xmath76 @xcite for electron deuteron elastic scattering allow the extraction of the three electromagnetic deuteron ffs up to @xmath79 2 gev@xmath31 .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the world data were collected and three different analytical parametrizations were suggested , with a number of parameters varying from 12 to 33 .",
    "in general , the existing parametrizations of deuteron electromagnetic ffs contain a large number of parameters , and are often based on analytical formulas , with poor physical content . an attempt to find a global description based on the vector dominance model , and satisfying the asymptotic conditions predicted by qcd at large @xmath3 , @xcite , lead to a twelve parameters fit .",
    "the fit was updated including the world data on @xmath51 elastic scattering in ref .",
    "@xcite where two other fits were suggested .",
    "one is a sum of inverse polynomial terms , where the first node of the corresponding ffs was introduced in a global multiplicative term .",
    "the number of free parameters , necessary to obtain @xmath80 , was eighteen .",
    "the last parametrization is a sum of gaussians , with some physical constraints on the parameters , which are the width and the position of the maximum of the gaussians . in total",
    "the parametrization contains 33 parameters for @xmath80 .",
    "we suggest here a simpler parametrization , based on transparent physical content , with a minimal number of parameters .",
    "more precisely , we extend a two - component parametrization , already successfully applied to nucleon electromagnetic ffs @xcite and recently to strange nucleon ffs @xcite , to the deuteron electromagnetic ffs .",
    "the deuteron is an isoscalar particle , therefore , considering only the contribution of the isoscalar vector mesons , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one can write : @xmath81 with : @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) is the mass of the @xmath1 ( @xmath2)-meson . note that the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath85 is parametrized in such form that @xmath86 , for any values of the free parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are real numbers .",
    "the terms @xmath89 are written as functions of two parameters , also real , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , generally different for each ff : @xmath92^{\\delta_i } , \\label{eq : eq12}\\ ] ] and @xmath93 is the normalization of the @xmath94-th ff at @xmath50 : @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are the quadrupole and the magnetic moments of the deuteron .",
    "in ref . @xcite the existing data on @xmath51 elastic scattering , differential cross section and the polarization observables , were reconsidered .",
    "values of the three deuteron ffs were extracted , for the @xmath3 values where @xmath76 measurements were available , getting the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 from an interpolation of the data on the differential cross section .",
    "while the magnetic ff , @xmath74 , is directly related to @xmath28 , the extraction of the charge and quadrupole ffs requires the solution of two quadratic equations , which may lead , in some cases , to two possible roots .",
    "therefore , the analysis of @xmath72 and @xmath73 consists in two different sets of solutions and two corresponding fits .    the experimental data for @xmath100 and @xmath101 show the existence of a zero , for @xmath102 gev@xmath31 and @xmath103 gev@xmath31 .",
    "the constraint of a node gives the following relation between the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath104 and @xmath25 : @xmath105 in the fitting procedure this relation allows to obtain a better description of the data and a faster convergency , reducing the number of free parameters .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) contains four parameters , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , generally different for different ffs .",
    "we consider the region @xmath106 gev@xmath31 , where the separation of @xmath100 and @xmath107 has been done .    in principle the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 , eq . ( [ eq : eq12 ] )",
    ", may be fixed by the asymptotic behavior of the deuteron ffs , which follows from quark counting rules @xcite .",
    "however , the range of applicability of the present parametrization is _ a priori _ restricted to @xmath106 gev@xmath31 and this region is expected to be far from the asymptotic region @xcite .    the data basis of the present study consists in the data tabulated as in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite corresponding to @xmath110 @xmath111 should be @xmath112 , instead of @xmath113 @xcite ] and completed by more recent measurements from ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a result of the procedure for the extraction of the values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 from @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath116 ,",
    "some experimental points show a large asymmetry of the errors , which can not be neglected in this analysis .",
    "while there is still no general guide how to treat asymmetric errors , we used two different ways to handle them . at first",
    "no asymmetry was assumed and the average of the upper ( @xmath117 ) and lower ( @xmath118 ) errors was taken .",
    "then , two approaches recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite were applied .",
    "model 1 , as proposed in the paper , assumes linear dependencies and defines the contribution to a modified @xmath119 as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the discrepancy between the @xmath94-th experimental point and the value of the corresponding function .",
    "model 2 , preferred by the author , is based on a quadratic approximation .",
    "it was not always suitable for our analysis , because , in some cases it does nt give real solutions for the contribution to @xmath119 .    in any case",
    ", the analysis which takes into account the asymmetry of errors ( [ eq : eqfit ] ) gives significant reduction of @xmath119 in all cases , but it did nt influence significantly the resulting parameters of the fit , except for @xmath115 , where the errors on the parameters were significantly reduced .",
    "the results were firstly obtained with a three parameter fit @xmath122 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and the constraint ( [ eq : eqal ] ) for @xmath100 and @xmath101 and a four parameter fit @xmath70 , @xmath122 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) , for @xmath107 .    the parameters @xmath109 and @xmath108 are similar for all ffs @xmath100 and @xmath101 , with good accuracy ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "a change within 10% in the position of the node , slightly affects the quality of the fit , improving in general one parametrization , while the other gets worse .",
    "the fit is quite sensitive to the choice of initial parameters , in particular for @xmath107 . in case of @xmath107 , which is not constrained by a node",
    ", a good fit can be obtained with a large cancellation of the terms driven by @xmath70 and @xmath122 .    the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 characterize the global structure of the deuteron , and the factor @xmath123 is related to the two nucleon core of the deuteron .",
    "but the isoscalar structure of the electromagnetic structure of the deuteron ffs , which is described by the functions @xmath85 , in terms of @xmath2- and @xmath1-mesons contributions , is different for the three ffs , with different sets of parameters @xmath70 and @xmath122 .    from table [ tab1 ] one can see that the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 are not so different for the three ffs .",
    "this means that ffs would be mostly sensitive to the meson cloud . in order to test this ,",
    "a global fit was performed , keeping the @xmath108 and @xmath109 the same for the three ffs , and fitting ( or fixing ) @xmath70 and @xmath122 as previously . in such fit , two solutions appear also for @xmath101 , related to the choice of the other two ffs .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : gc ] , [ fig : gm ] and [ fig : gq ] , the data points used in the present fit are shown , together with the result of this last fit ( solid ( dashed ) lines correspond respectively to the first ( second ) parametrization ) .",
    "open symbols in figs .",
    "[ fig : gc ] and [ fig : gq ] correspond to the second solution for @xmath100 and @xmath107 .",
    "the values of the best fit parameters are reported in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the common parameters are @xmath124 , @xmath125 , for the first solution , corresponding to @xmath126 , whereas , for the second one , @xmath127 , @xmath125 and @xmath128 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to study the behavior of deuteron ffs , in framework of qcd , a reduced deuteron ff , @xmath129 , was defined as : @xmath130 where @xmath131 gev@xmath31 and @xmath132 is a generalized nucleon electromagnetic ff on the choice of @xmath132 can be found in ref .",
    "] .    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqbr ] ) , one can identify @xmath89 with the term @xmath133 , then one expects @xmath134 and @xmath135 . from table 1",
    "it appears that @xmath136 , but @xmath108 is larger and corresponds to @xmath137 gev@xmath31 .",
    "the product @xmath138 is related to the radius of the two - nucleon ( 2n ) component , and one finds : @xmath139=1.7 fm , for @xmath140  gev@xmath31 .",
    "note , in this respect , that the standard nonrelativistic description of the deuteron results in @xmath141 fm , where @xmath142 is the deuteron binding energy .",
    "data are not expected to be extended at higher @xmath3 in next future .",
    "so , the present parametrization can not be constrained at higher @xmath3 . nevertheless , we compared the predictions for the structure function @xmath27 , which has been measured up to 6 gev@xmath31 , as well as for the observables @xmath28 and @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obser ] ) .",
    "the description is good , as expected , in the range constrained by the fit .",
    "the difference between the experiment and the suggested parametrization visible for @xmath27 at larger @xmath3 , depends on the parametrization used , due in particular to the position of a second node which appears for @xmath72 . the individual charge , magnetic and quadrupole contributions to @xmath27",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aq ] , for the two possible solutions .",
    "the discrepancy between the data for @xmath27 and the suggested deuteron ffs parametrizations can be interpreted as an indication that the region at @xmath143 2 gev@xmath31 is a transition region from the hadronic description of the deuteron structure to the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "another possible source of the difficulty to extend the fit at higher @xmath3 may originate from the fact that at some point , at large @xmath3 , the one - photon approximation , that is at the basis of the relations used here among ffs and experimental observables , and usually assumed in electron hadron elastic and inelastic scattering , does not hold anymore .",
    "a mechanism , where two photons , which equally share the momentum transfer squared , could become important . a discussion of this problem , concerning",
    "precisely @xmath51 elastic scattering data , can be found in ref .",
    "we suggested a simple parametrization of the three deuteron electromagnetic ffs , with a minimal number of parameters , based on a transparent physical picture . it can be used in the comparison of different theoretical models with experiments involving deuterons , and for a precise analytical interpolation of the experimental points in the region @xmath144 gev@xmath31 .",
    "the present parametrization is based on a classical description of the deuteron structure , in terms of hadronic ( nucleon+meson ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the region of @xmath3 , where the separation of the charge and quadrupole deuteron ffs has been done , can not be easily extended in next future @xcite . for @xmath145 gev@xmath31 , polarization measurements ( which normally require a secondary scattering or a polarized target )",
    "are extremely challenging at the present accelerators , with the present techniques of polarized targets or polarimeters due to the steep decreasing of the cross section .",
    "the parametrization proposed here can be considered a generalization of the model @xcite , developped for the nucleon electromagnatic ffs . as in the nucleon case ,",
    "the considered parametrization obeys , by construction , to the analyticity properties of ffs and can be extended to the time - like region .",
