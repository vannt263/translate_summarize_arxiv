    "despite its conceptual simplicity a random walk can describe several and very different transport phenomena .",
    "examples include heat transport  @xcite , animal foraging  @xcite , human travel  @xcite , molecular diffusion  @xcite , and the propagation of waves in random media  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental aspect of random walks in disordered media is the scaling property of the dynamics , which is commonly expressed by the following type of propagator  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an invariant profile function , @xmath2 is the ( mass ) fractal dimension of the system and @xmath3 is the walk dimension ( namely the fractal dimension of the random walk ) .",
    "this relation expresses the general fact that the propagator @xmath4 , which provides the probability density to find a random walker in point @xmath5 at time @xmath6 starting from @xmath7 at @xmath8 , can be rescaled onto @xmath1 at any time @xmath6 .",
    "most importantly , the propagator @xmath4 is expected to spread asymptotically with the characteristic length @xmath9 . as the value of the walk dimension reveals unambiguously whether the process is diffusive ( @xmath10 ) , subdiffusive ( @xmath11 ) or superdiffusive ( @xmath12 ) , it has become a key observable in the anomalous transport research  @xcite .",
    "measurements have been performed on the random walk of small objects , like particles and molecules  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the actual trajectories of the objects could be monitored in time _ inside _ the complex medium and thus eq .  ( [ eq : propagator ] ) could be directly tested . similarly to massive objects , multiply scattered waves in disordered media may also propagate anomalously  @xcite , in which case the experimental retrieval of @xmath3 is particularly challenging . in recent years superdiffusion of light has been investigated in disordered photonics materials dubbed lvy glasses  @xcite and in hot atomic vapors  @xcite .",
    "however , neither experiments on the dynamics of anomalous transport have been performed nor the walk dimension @xmath3 has been measured .    here",
    "we report on the experimental retrieval of the fractal dimension of an optical random walk , by analyzing the scaling of the time - resolved transmission with sample size .",
    "we show that this type of analysis can clearly distinguish between different transport regimes - from diffusive to superdiffusive - consistent with the topology of the system . apart from the retrieval of @xmath13 for an optical random system",
    ", this study also provides a direct confirmation of superdiffusion in lvy glasses .",
    "the concept is general and applies to other transport phenomena .",
    "lvy glasses provide a convenient playground for the investigation of anomalous diffusion since their structural parameters can be readily varied .",
    "moreover , the use of light waves has the enormous advantage that transport can be studied via simple observables , and a large statistics can be accumulated .",
    "the lvy glasses used in these experiments are obtained by embedding glass microspheres with diameter @xmath14 distributed with a power - law , @xmath15 , into an index - matched polymer matrix containing randomly dispersed tio@xmath16 nanoparticles  ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "light is scattered by the nanoparticles in between the microspheres , while propagating freely inside them .",
    "the power - law heterogeneity size distribution @xmath17 is created to yield a heavy - tailed step length distribution for the random walk of light , and is expected to lead to superdiffusion  @xcite .",
    "the `` degree of superdiffusivity '' may then be controlled via the exponent @xmath18 at the sample preparation stage .",
    "the structure is contained between two glass slides , index - matched with the polymer matrix and the microspheres , with the sample thickness @xmath19 approximately equal to the largest sphere diameter .",
    "measurements were also performed on samples containing an homogeneous random distribution of nanoparticles .",
    "these were obtained by substituting the microspheres of lvy glasses with an equivalent volume of polymer .",
    "such samples are expected to be diffusive and differ from lvy glasses only in the spatial distribution of scatterers .",
    "in addition , given the equal volume - averaged density of nanoparticles , it is expected that the step length distribution of these samples differs from lvy glasses only in its second moment but not in its first moment ( i.e. , equal mean step )  @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed by shining 130  fs laser pulses at 810 nm wavelength on the sample and collecting the transmitted light . by adopting a nonlinear optical gating technique",
    "@xcite we monitor the temporal profile of the transmission with sub - ps resolution [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) ] ( see appendix  [ appendixb ] ) .",
    "and @xmath20 m for different injection points on the surface .",
    "the early - time response strongly depends on the source position while at late times , the intensity decays exponentially with a narrow lifetime distribution ( see the inset ) .",
    "( c ) average time - resolved transmission for the lvy glass in ( b ) and a homogeneous sample .",
    "the two samples have a comparable thickness and the same volume - averaged density of tio@xmath16 nanoparticles .",
    "the curves have been normalized to the laser pulse power .",
    "the time - resolved transmission responses are strikingly different , indeed the first light arrives later and the lifetime is longer for the homogeneous sample .",
    "a fit with diffusion theory returns a transport mean free path @xmath21 m . ]    figure  [ fig:1](b ) shows a series of measurements of the time - resolved transmission performed on a lvy glass ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 m ) for different injection points on the sample surface .",
    "the strong dependence of the early - time profile with the injection point is evident , in sharp contrast with the late - time behavior , where an exponential tail @xmath24 with a well - defined lifetime @xmath25 is observed ( see the inset ) .",
    "the intensity fluctuation at early times is transient , and due to the large - scale heterogeneities of the sample @xcite which allow light to escape from deep inside in only a few scattering events .",
    "the fluctuations vanish at times larger than @xmath25 , which is approximately the time needed to explore all regions of the sample ( the thouless time  @xcite ) and reach ergodicity .",
    "this transient , position - dependent , dynamics is not observed in statistically homogeneous systems .",
    "figure  [ fig:1](c ) shows the comparison between the time - resolved transmission of the lvy glass and the reference homogeneous sample . the average profile for the homogeneous sample does not exhibit any sharp features at early times , as expected .",

    "( b ) calculation of @xmath29 versus @xmath19 from diffusion theory shows the effect of finite system size on the evaluation of @xmath27 .",
    "the highlighted interval corresponds to the thickness range of investigation which returns a value in good agreement with the measured one .",
    "( c ) the scaling exponent @xmath3 is retrieved from the fit @xmath30 .",
    "the additional reference data point shows that at larger @xmath19 the deviation between diffusive and superdiffusive scaling is expected to be even clearer .",
    "unfortunately , so far , we could not realize reliable lvy glasses at larger thicknesses .",
    "the fits for the two data sets are performed on the same thickness range . ]    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the time - resolved transmission is expected to verify asymptotically the following scaling behavior : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an invariant transmission function and @xmath33 a characteristic exponent related to the steady - state transmission properties .",
    "furthermore , given the exponential tail of the transmission curve @xmath34 ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , we expect the lifetime to scale as @xmath35 . hence , we performed time - resolved transmission experiments on samples with different thicknesses to retrieve the scaling exponent @xmath3 .",
    "we considered lvy glasses with two heterogeneity size distributions ( @xmath22 and @xmath36 ) and the corresponding homogeneous samples .",
    "the volume - averaged density of nanoparticles was kept constant in all samples for the sake of comparison .",
    "the importance of this point will be discussed later on .",
    "the lifetime @xmath25 was obtained from the decay at long times , using an average over 30 different injection points , leading to a standard deviation smaller than @xmath37 .    as we are considering real ( finite ) systems a quantitative analysis of their scaling properties requires to account for the presence of boundaries .",
    "however , we prefer to start by showing the raw data since they already allow for important physical considerations . figure  [ fig:2](a ) shows the measured @xmath25 as a function of @xmath19 for lvy glasses with @xmath22 and the homogeneous samples .",
    "their dependence with sample thickness turns out to be very different , as a consequence of a pure spatial redistribution of the scatterers .",
    "we quantify this difference by performing a fit to the data with a generic power - law function @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a constant and @xmath27 is the measured scaling exponent . the fits return @xmath40 for the lvy glass and @xmath41 for the homogeneous media , thereby revealing a remarkably different dynamics .",
    "the smaller @xmath27 in the lvy glass indicates a faster growth of the characteristic length @xmath42 with time , originating from the heavy - tailed step length distribution .",
    "the same analysis performed on the @xmath43 lvy glass yields @xmath44 .",
    "this shows that the light transport dynamics is dictated by the heterogeneity size distribution , via the @xmath18 exponent .",
    "we now consider the effect of system finiteness on the evaluation of the scaling exponent .",
    "it is well known that the diffuse lifetime in finite systems should scale as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the so - called `` extrapolation length ''  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath47 for three - dimensional systems with index matched boundaries ( neglecting internal reflections )  @xcite , when @xmath48 the contribution of @xmath46 to @xmath49 is negligible ( @xmath50 ) and thus @xmath51 .",
    "however , for our homogeneous sample with @xmath52 m and thicknesses in the range @xmath53 m , we expect a difference between @xmath27 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is evident also from fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , where @xmath54 is reported as a function of the optical thickness @xmath55 .",
    "the exponent @xmath27 obtained in the thickness range under consideration is in good agreement with the experimentally retrieved value ( @xmath41 ) and the limit @xmath56 is reached only for thicker samples .",
    "since there is currently no theory available to calculate the extrapolation length for lvy glasses , we use the diffusive case as a starting point and assume that the relation @xmath57 provides at least the right order of magnitude of the extrapolation length   remains of the order of @xmath58 .",
    "both homogeneous samples and lvy glasses were prepared to have the same mean step length  @xcite , which simplifies the analysis .",
    "power - law fits of the lifetime data using @xmath59 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) and the results are summarized in table  [ tb : scaling exponents ] .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath3 obtained for the homogeneous sample is fully consistent with diffusive transport and those for the lvy glasses are markedly smaller than 2 .    .measured scaling exponents .",
    "the values reported for @xmath27 and @xmath3 have been obtained as best fit exponents of the functions @xmath38 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "errors have a statistical confidence of 95@xmath60 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",

    "the time axis was rescaled as @xmath62 .",
    "regarding the transmission axis , we found that a very good collapse of the exponential tails _ for all systems investigated here _ was obtained using @xmath63 , i.e. by taking @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalingtransmission ] ) .",
    "quite remarkably , this is the value expected for annealed lvy walks  ( see appendix  [ appendixc ] ) .",
    "the overall superposition of the transmission curves is excellent , showing that the measured scaling exponent @xmath3 constitutes a unique parameter describing anomalous dynamics in these systems .",
    "the deviation at early times is also expected since the quasi - ballistic trajectories do not obey the scaling hypothesis that describes the spreading of the superdiffusive propagator .",

    "the axes shows that the ( anomalous ) transport dynamics is described by a unique scaling exponent @xmath3 . ]",
    "we conclude by discussing some interesting points for future investigation .",
    "first , the standard approach to deal with the finiteness of open disordered systems , via the extrapolation length , should be revisited to take into account non - exponential step length distributions . for power - law distributions ,",
    "this problem is directly related to the treatment of boundaries in the presence of spatial nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "second , our scaling analysis has been performed on a restricted thickness range while it would be interesting to investigate , both experimentally and theoretically , the limit towards infinite system size  @xcite . with respect to this important issue",
    ", there will be a difference between the case of fixed filling fraction of heterogeneities , and that of maximal filling .",
    "a recent numerical study on two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems  @xcite has shown that the fixed filling fraction case eventually leads to normal diffusion , while the maximal filled case leads to superdiffusion , provided that the system converges towards 100% voids surrounded by point scatterers .",
    "it is hence of fundamental importance to define properly how the limit to infinite system size is taken .",
    "third , the scaling exponents retrieved experimentally here do not fully match with those expected from a `` chord - length '' model , i.e. @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this simplified model neglects the possibility of crossing multiple voids in one step and of having correlations between successive steps due to quenched disorder , which are both expected to affect the dynamics  @xcite , and which deserve further attention .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a first experimental investigation of the walk dimension @xmath3 for light waves in disordered photonic structures .",
    "the retrieval of @xmath3 is possible via a scaling analysis of the lifetime , and allows one to distinguish clearly between regular and superdiffusive transport dynamics in lvy glasses .",
    "these results show how the photonics of disorder can be used in the research on anomalous transport  @xcite , and that it can provide a new setting to investigate wave diffusion on fractal media  @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate how the fractal dimension plays a role in interference effects , like weak and strong localization  @xcite , where the dimensionality of the system can make a crucial difference between the occurrence of extended or localized states .",
