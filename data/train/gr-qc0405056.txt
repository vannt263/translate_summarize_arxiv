    "topology is one of the fundamental qualitative properties of a black hole .",
    "it was investigated by many authors and now it is known that , under some reasonable conditions such as asymptotic flatness and the weak energy condition , each component of the black hole region is topologically trivial , _",
    "i.e. _ , simply connected  @xcite . on the other hand , there were numerical simulations which suggest non - trivial topologies of the horizons  @xcite .",
    "there has been some confusion , but it is now well understood that even though the black hole region in the spacetime is simply connected , there are many possible topologies of spatial sections . in particular ,",
    "one of the authors  @xcite showed how topology of the spatial sections of a black hole is related to the endpoint set , or similarly , the _ crease set _ , of the event horizon .",
    "therefore the crease set of an event horizon , or of a cauchy horizon , is an important object which is independent from the choice of time slices and which determines qualitative properties of the horizon .",
    "thus , to restrict the physically possible topologies of the black hole it is important to restrict the possible structure of the crease set .    in this paper",
    "we classify the possible topological structure of the crease set .",
    "`` possible '' structures are important because they are the only ones that actually appear in the real world .",
    "there are at least two ways to define the `` possible '' structure : by _ stability _ and by _ genericity_. in both approaches we consider spacetimes with different metrics .",
    "a stable structure is the one that is invariant against small change of the metric .",
    "a generic structure is , intuitively , the one that we find when he randomly pick up a spacetime .",
    "physically , the small change of the metric may be interpreted as follows .",
    "first , in theoretical treatment of the world , we always assume some simple evolution equation and equation of state for matter .",
    "the precise equations may never be known .",
    "second , when we are to determine the spacetime by observations , we can never collect perfectly accurate data of field strengths or matter density at all points of the spacetime .",
    "there must be errors and limits .",
    "third , if we consider quantum mechanics , the fields and the metric can actually fluctuate at small scales . we shall give the precise mathematical definitions later .",
    "one interesting thing is that the both approaches lead the same conclusion ( theorem  [ th : th2 ] ) , namely , stability and genericity are equivalent .    our stability /",
    "genericity approach is complementary to the analysis of exact solutions such as the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes because the exact solutions are usually obtained by assuming high symmetry and many of its properties , especially topological ones , are not stable against perturbations  @xcite .",
    "one approach and the results will serve as guiding principles in the study of the black hole spacetime in mathematical relativity or in astrophysics .",
    "the studies in the present paper are common for event horizons and cauchy horizons , except for their direction of time .",
    "therefore we only consider event horizons in the rest of the present paper .",
    "the same results hold for cauchy horizons .    in sect .",
    "[ fermat ] , we define fermat s potential in a general nonstationary spacetime representing a gravitational collapse which is essential for the crease set and its classification . in sect .",
    "[ maxwell ] , we give the precise definition of the maxwell set which corresponds to the crease set of the event horizon .",
    "we also define stability and genericity of the maxwell set , and introduce concepts necessary for our investigation .",
    "we show in sect .",
    "[ class ] the equivalence of stability and genericity and obtain a list of stable fermat potentials .",
    "we give in sect .",
    "[ class - max ] the classification of the stable maxwell sets . in sect .",
    "[ other - dim ] , we discuss the cases of spacetimes of dimension other than four .",
    "[ conc ] is for conclusion and discussions",
    ".    for the terms and notations about causal structure of a spacetime , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "an event horizon is generated by null geodesics .",
    "a future event horizon @xmath0 can not have future endpoints , but can have past endpoints if it is not eternal . as is pointed out in @xcite , the _ endpoint set _",
    "@xmath1 of a horizon is an arc - wise connected acausal set .",
    "points @xmath2 are classified by the _ multiplicity _ @xmath3 of @xmath4 , the number of the generators emanating from @xmath4 : @xmath5 the set @xmath6 is called the _",
    "crease set _ of the horizon .",
    "the crease set contains the interior of the endpoint set , _",
    "i.e. _ , the closure of @xmath6 contains @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the crease set @xmath6 equals the set of points of @xmath1 on which the horizon is not differentiable , _",
    "i.e. _ , the horizon is differentiable at @xmath2 if and only if @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the horizon @xmath0 is the envelope of the light cone starting from the crease set @xmath6 which is an arc - wise connected acausal subset of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , if the spatial section of the horizon is a topological sphere at late times , the topology of the spatial section of the horizon can be nontrivial only at the crease set and the topology is completely determined by the time slicing of the crease set .",
    "this is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in detail . in particular ,",
    "when the crease set is a single point , all the possible spatial section of the horizon is a topological sphere . on the contrary ,",
    "when the crease set has a disk - like structure , the horizon can have toroidal or higher - genus spatial sections .",
    "one would see the coalesce of horizons if the crease set has a line - like structure  @xcite .",
    "therefore by classifying the structure of the crease set , we will know all possible topologies of the horizons .",
    "here we do not assume that the spatial section of the horizon in the future is a sphere .",
    "the crease set can be determined by fermat s principle in a simple stationary spacetime . in a non - stationary spacetime",
    ", we can extend fermat s principle and find a variational principle about light paths , imposing some appropriate causality condition such as global hyperbolicity . here",
    "we show an example of the construction of the fermat potential .",
    "let us assume that the spacetime @xmath8 is smooth and is globally hyperbolic from a smooth cauchy surface @xmath9 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we consider a spacetime of gravitational collapse , namely , we assume that the event horizon @xmath0 is in the future of @xmath9 . by global hyperbolicity",
    ", there are always an appropriate smooth global time coordinate @xmath11 and a timelike vector field @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "the spacetime @xmath8 is foliated by cauchy surfaces @xmath14 .",
    "the vector field @xmath15 defines a smooth projection @xmath16 from @xmath8 into the @xmath17 ( see fig.[fig : fermat ] ) ; @xmath18",
    "conversely , there is a diffeomorphism @xmath19 because @xmath0 is achronal , the restriction of @xmath16 on @xmath0 is injective and has an inverse , which we denote by @xmath20 : @xmath21 the map @xmath20 is lipschitz .",
    "we take some ( sufficiently large ) @xmath22 and assume that @xmath23 is diffeomorphic to a compact manifold @xmath24 .",
    "we consider @xmath24 as a fixed submanifold embedded in @xmath9 so that @xmath25 .",
    "consider a neighbourhood @xmath26 of @xmath27 in @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath28 and @xmath29 we define fermat s potential as follows : @xmath30 the minimum points of @xmath31 corresponds to the generator of @xmath0 through @xmath32 .",
    "in particular ,",
    "when the spacetime is static , the fermat potential is the spatial geodesic distance , namely , @xmath33 the projection @xmath16 is generated by the timelike killing vector and @xmath34 is an induced metric of the hypersurface @xmath35 orthogonal to the timelike killing vector .",
    "our definition ( [ eq - fermat ] ) is the generalization of this geodesic distance function ( [ eq - dist ] ) to the non - static spacetime .    from ( [ eq - fermat ] ) , the crease set @xmath6 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the maxwell set of @xmath31 where @xmath31 has two or more minimum points . we shall give a precise mathematical definition and a framework to study its properties later .",
    "let us consider a small change of the metric on @xmath8 . to be precise",
    ", we may define the small change by a @xmath38 whitney topology on the metric tensor field on @xmath8 .",
    "sufficiently small change of the metric leaves the vector field @xmath12 timelike and the cauchy surfaces @xmath39 spacelike . the horizon near @xmath40 changes only slightly in the spacetime @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this causes a small change of the diffeomorphism @xmath20 from @xmath24 to @xmath41 but the topology of @xmath24 does not change . also , the null geodesic system hence @xmath42 changes slightly .",
    "these cause the fermat potential @xmath31 to be deformed slightly . in the sequel we shall study the stability and genericity of @xmath31 and @xmath37 against this deformation of @xmath31 .    in the formulation using such a potential function ,",
    "actually a state space becomes infinite dimensional manifold , since we should not consider only the endpoints but also the path connecting them .",
    "however , if one can restrict the set of path into a finite dimensional family , the state space reduces to finite dimensional one  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in our case , two different points on event horizon can not be connected by more than one generators by the fact that the generators of event horizon can not have future endpoint .    on the other hand ,",
    "in special cases one can take no spatial section on which there is no singular point of the horizon  @xcite . of course",
    ", such a difficulty is resolved in other formulations using `` lagrange manifold '' and the result will not change .",
    "we are not concerned with this any more in the following .",
    "the goal of our present study is to classify all generally possible structure about the singularities of the fermat potential determining the horizon .",
    "as we shall see , the generic structure will be given by studying singularities of stable fermat potentials concretely .",
    "the genericity or stability is defined as the property under small perturbations in a sense of whitney topology . on the other hand ,",
    "the stable fermat potential is equivalent to the universal unfolding ( parameter deformation family of a function ) with the same number of deformation parameters .",
    "then our main task is to give a classification of the universal unfoldings .",
    "the above is a usual procedure when one discuss the bifurcation structure , so - called caustics , of a system . however , our main object here is not the bifurcation set but the maxwell set ( the difference will become clear later ) .",
    "the problem is not purely local but is rather semi - local .",
    "the definition of maxwell set is local in control ( parameter ) space @xmath43 but is non - local in state ( variable ) space @xmath24 . to treat this we introduce function multigerms .",
    "we will classify the universal multiunfoldings and the maxwell sets .",
    "finally , we note that the catastrophe changes when some symmetry is present .",
    "an example is the toroidal event horizon studied in refs .",
    "this is not a universal unfolding but an unfolding with infinite codimension .",
    "now we give the mathematical framework to study the maxwell set .",
    "the maxwell set of a function unfolding is the set of all values of the parameters for which the minimum is attained either at a non - morse critical point or at two or more critical points . in the following we sometimes make @xmath32 as a representative of the state variables and @xmath4 the control variables . of course , @xmath31 is not a global function on @xmath44 rather a function on manifold @xmath45 , where @xmath24 is two - dimensional compact manifold and @xmath43 is an open subset of @xmath46 .",
    "we will mainly deal with function germs instead of functions , since we are only concerned with local properties of a function on some neighbourhood of @xmath47 , to treat this , we introduce a germ of map which is an equivalence class of maps at a neighbourhood @xmath48 .",
