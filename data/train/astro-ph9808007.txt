    "the detection of delayed x - ray , optical and radio emission following a grb , known as grb afterglow , is described reasonably well by emission from a spherical relativistic shell , decelerating upon collision with an ambient medium ( waxman 1997a , wijers , rees & mszros 1997 , katz & piran 1997 , sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "a relativistic blast wave expands through the ambient medium , continuously heating up fresh matter as it passes through the shock . in these models ,",
    "the grb afterglow is the result of synchrotron emission of the relativistic electrons of the heated matter .",
    "several recent works considered emission from various regions on or behind the shock front ( waxman 1997c , sari 1998 , panaitescu & mszros 1998 , granot , piran & sari 1998 ( gps hereafter ) , gruzinov & waxman 1998 ) .",
    "these authors considered the spectra near the peak frequency @xmath6 and found that exact calculations of the spectrum could differ by up to one order of magnitude from simpler estimates .",
    "we consider emission from an adiabatic highly relativistic blast wave expanding into a cold and uniform medium .",
    "we consider the effect of the whole volume behind the shock front , the importance of which was stressed in gps .",
    "the hydrodynamics is described by the blandford mckee ( 1976 denoted bm hereafter ) self similar solution .",
    "we consider synchrotron emission and we ignore compton scattering and electron cooling .",
    "similar to gps , we consider several models for the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "synchrotron self absorption becomes significant below a critical frequency @xmath0 called the self absorption frequency .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is the peak frequency , which is reasonable for the first few months after the burst .",
    "while the spectrum near @xmath6 was quite extensively studied , so far only order of magnitude estimates of the spectrum near the self absorption frequency @xmath0 were done .    for a system in which @xmath7 , the spectrum , @xmath8 , is proportional to @xmath9 for @xmath10 , rather than the standard @xmath11 , because almost all the low frequency radiation is emitted by electrons with a typical synchrotron frequency much higher than @xmath0 ( katz 1994 ) .",
    "the spectra far above @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we explore the spectra near @xmath0 , and find how the two asymptotic forms join together .",
    "an analysis of the spectra over a wider range of frequencies was made by sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) , and a detailed analysis of the spectra near the peak frequency , taking a full account of the bm solution , was made in gps and gruzinov & waxman ( 1998 ) .",
    "the physical model is described in  2 . in ",
    "3 we describe the computational formalism .",
    "the spectra for several magnetic field models and the observed image of a grb afterglow at various frequencies are presented in  4 . in ",
    "5 we compare the calculated spectra to radio observations of the afterglow of grb970508 . when we use the modified calculations of the self absorption spectra and of the spectra around the peak ( gps ) and the cooling frequency ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) we find new estimates of the parameters of grb970508 .",
    "these estimates are different by more than an order of magnitude than estimates based on a simpler broken power law spectra ( wijers & galama 1998 ) .",
    "the underlying model assumes an ultra - relativistic spherical blast wave expanding into a cold and uniform medium .",
    "the blast wave constantly heats fresh matter , and the observed afterglow is the result of synchrotron emission of the relativistic electrons of the heated matter .",
    "we consider an adiabatic evolution , where the fluid behind the shock is described by the bm self similar solution .",
    "it has been numerically verified that for an adiabatic evolution with general initial conditions the solution approaches the bm solution ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1998 ) .",
    "the bm solution is expressed in terms of the similarity variable @xmath13 , which is defined by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radius of the shock front , @xmath16 is the distance of a point from the center of the burst and @xmath17 is the lorentz factor of the matter just behind the shock .",
    "the bm solution is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number density and the energy density in the local frame , respectively , @xmath21 is the lorentz factor of the bulk motion of the matter behind the shock , @xmath22 is the mass of a proton and @xmath23 is the proper number density of the unshocked ambient medium .",
    "we consider three alternative models for the magnetic field : @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . @xmath24",
    "satisfies @xmath27 ( i.e. equipartition ) everywhere .",
    "for the two other magnetic field models we assume they acquire @xmath27 on the shock front , and from then on , evolve according to the `` frozen field '' approximation .",
    "this implies that the magnetic fields equal @xmath28 , where @xmath29 when the magnetic field is in the radial direction ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath30 when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the radial direction ( @xmath25 ) ( see gps ) .",
    "we assume that the energy of the electrons is everywhere a constant fraction of the internal energy : @xmath31 , and that the shock produces a power law electron distribution : @xmath32 . ] for @xmath33 .",

    "the constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the electron distribution can be calculated from the number density and energy density : @xmath38    we consider frequencies which are much lower than the typical synchrotron frequency @xmath39 , where the spectral power of an electron emitting synchrotron radiation can be approximated by : @xmath40 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) where @xmath41 is the gamma function , @xmath42 is the magnetic field , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mass and the electric charge of the electron , respectively , and @xmath45 is the angle between the directions of the electron s velocity and the magnetic field , in the local frame .",

    "the specific intensity @xmath69 ( energy per unit time per unit area per unit frequency per unit solid angle ) satisfies the radiative transfer equation : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the emission coefficient and the absorption coefficient , respectively , and @xmath73 is the distance along the beam .",
    "when self absorption becomes important the contribution to @xmath69 depends on the optical depth along the path within the emitting system and @xmath69 should be integrated separately for every trajectory .    for the bm solution ,",
    "the radius of the shock front and the lorentz factor of the matter just behind the shock , on the los for a given observed time @xmath74 , are given by : @xmath75 for a given observed time @xmath74 , we use the coordinates @xmath76 and @xmath13 , instead of the polar coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath77 , where @xmath76 is defined by @xmath78 .",

    "we have calculated the observed spectra near @xmath0 for three different magnetic field models ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the spectra differs more than a few percent from the asymptotic power laws only for frequencies less than half an order of magnitude above or below @xmath0 .",

    "the power law @xmath35 of the electron distribution can be determined from the high energy slope ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible with sufficient observational data to determine all the physical parameters of the afterglow : @xmath35 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath175 .",
    "a similar calculation ( using an equation for the cooling frequency @xmath180 instead of @xmath121 ) was made by wijers & galama ( 1998 ) for grb970508 .",
    "in fact combining this equation we could even have an over - constrained system and check for consistency of the solution .",
    "the equation we obtained from @xmath0 differs by a factor of @xmath173 from the corresponding equation given in wijers & galama .",
    "this has a significant effect ( up to a factor of @xmath177 ) on the values of the physical parameters of the burst which they have given .",
    "we have shown ( table 1 ) that if other equations are corrected as well , the values of the physical parameters vary even more ( up to two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "we thank ehud cohen for useful discussions and dale frail and shri kulkarni for observational information .",
