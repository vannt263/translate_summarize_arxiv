    "one ingredient of the proof in @xcite is their proposition 2.1 which says that when @xmath7 the @xmath3 matrix @xmath2 has just one positive eigenvalue .",
    "we have remarked earlier that when @xmath48 the matrix @xmath2 is positive semidefinite and therefore , none of its eigenvalues is negative .",
    "this contrast as @xmath1 moves from @xmath49 to @xmath50 is intriguing , and raises the natural question about the behaviour of eigenvalues of @xmath2 for other values of @xmath8 bhatia and holbrook @xcite made a conjecture about this behaviour and established a small part of it : they settled the cases @xmath51 apart from @xmath52 and @xmath53 already mentioned .",

    "it is well - known that @xmath37 is operator convex for @xmath90    the proof of theorem [ thm1.1 ] is given in section 2 .",
