    "the su uma variables are a subclass of dwarf novae characterized by the presence of two types of eruptions - normal outburst having an amplitude of 2 - 3 mag and repeating typically every few tens of days and superoutburts with amplitude of 3 - 4 mag , lasting few times longer and occuring every year or so .",
    "these stars are belived to be binary systems consiting of the white dwarf primary and low mass main - sequence secondary filling its roche lobe and loosing material which forms an accretion disc around the primary .",
    "almost all su uma stars are close binaries with orbital period from 1.25 to slightly over 2 hours .",
    "this behaviour in now quite well understood within the frame of the thermal - tidal instability model ( see osaki 1996 for review ) .",
    "normal outbursts are caused by the thermal instability connected with transition of the material in the disc from neutral to ionized state .",
    "superoutbursts are a result of combined thermal and tidal instability , which , working together , are very effective with sweeping out the matter from the disc .    during the superoutburst , the characteristic tooth - shape light modulations with a period a few percent longer than the orbital period of the binary are observed .",
    "they are most probably the result of accretion disc `` precession '' ( in fact it is not classical precession but change of the position of the line of apsides ) caused by gravitational perturbations from the secondary . these perturbations are most effective when disc particles moving in eccentric orbits enter the 3:1 resonance .",
    "then the superhump period is simply the beat period between orbital and `` precession '' rate periods .    at the beginning of the 1990s ,",
    "the quite simple class of su umas started to be more complicated .",
    "the systems showing superhumps were divided into four subgroups :    * wz sge stars , characterized by an extremely long quiescent state , going into superoutburst every @xmath510 years and showing no or very infrequent ordinary outbursts ( patterson et al .",
    "2002 ) , * ordinary su uma stars , * er uma stars - systems characterized by an extremely short supercycle ( 20 - 60 days ) , a short interval between normal outbursts ( 3 - 4 days ) and small amplitude ( 23 mag ) of superoutbursts ( kato and kunjaya 1995 , robertson et al . 1995 ) , * permanent superhumpers - high accretion rate systems being permanently in superoutbursts ( skillman and patterson 1993 ) .",
    "we now believe that the classes listed above represent increasing mass transfer .",
    "systems with mass transfer rates as low as @xmath6 g / s are inactive , quiet and evolved stars of wz sge type containing brown dwarf degenerated secondary .",
    "classical su uma stars have mass transfer rates one magnitude higer and go into the superoutburt every year or so .",
    "er uma stars are high mass transfer rate systems ( few times per @xmath7 g / s ) showing frequent and relatively long superoutburst lasting for about half of the supercycle .",
    "the explanation of the shortest supercycles involves poorly understood mechanisms causing premature quench of the eruption ( osaki 1995 ) . and finally , permanent superhumpers are system with accretion disc which is thermaly stable and tidaly unstable all the time , i.e. being in permanent state of superoutburst .",
    "in order to firmly establish the mutual relations between these su uma subclasses one has to study systems located near to the borders between them . for these purposes we selected several poorly studied objects which are very interesting from the point of view of the theory which describes the origin of superhumps in dwarf novae systems . for a report of our northern hemisphere work performed at the ostrowik observatory see previous reports on our curve project , e.g. rutkowski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . since a significant number of these systems",
    "is located in the southern hemisphere , we applied for the observation time in south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) . for a pilot study",
    "we had been allocated time from august 15 to september 11 on elizabeth telescope at saao .",
    "the observations were performed by one of us ( a.r . ) using a 1-m cassegrain telescope of 8.5-m focal length .",
    "the telescope worked with ccd camera `` ste3 '' , back illuminated chip manufactured by site of size @xmath8 pixels .",
    "the image scale was 0.31 arcsec / pix providing a @xmath9 arcsec field of view .",
    "the camera worked with liquid nitrogen cooling .",
    "technology of the whole system allows to minimize the influence of noises like bias and dark current .",
    "thanks to that it was not necessary to obtain the bias and dark frames . the filters wheel was equipped with johnson - cousins @xmath10 filters but most of observations were obtained in white light as we wanted to examine temporal behaviour of light curve and have good quality photometry of faint objects .",
    "we were using exposure times ranging from 100 to 200 sec , depending on weather conditions and actual brightness of the object .",
    "data reduction was performed using a standard procedure based on iraf package .",
    "the profile photometry has been derived using the daophotii package ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the differential photometry provided measurements with accuracy in most cases around or below 0.01 mag .",
    "one object from our southern sky survey is dwarf nova bf ara .",
    "it was discovered as a variable by shapley and swope ( 1934 ) but the nature of its light variations remained unknown utill work of bruch ( 1983 ) who made @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 photometry of this object during one night in its bright state .",
    "the light curve exhibited a tooth - shape hump with an amplitude of 0.25 mag and period of roughly two hours .",
    "the conlusion was that bf ara might belong to the su uma dwarf novae .    in the years",
    "19972001 bf ara was regulary monitored by vsnet collabolators .",
    "these data allowed kato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to find that bf ara is one of the most active normal su uma stars with mean interval between the succesive superoutbursts amounting to 83.4 days .",
    "except for er uma stars , it was the shortest supercycle ever recorded , leaving ss umi with its 84.7 day value behind ( however , as was demonstrated by olech et al .",
    "2006 , ss umi could sometimes switch to normal behavior with much longer supercycles ) .",
    "detailed ccd photometry of bf ara in superoutburst was done by kato et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in august 2002 .",
    "good coverage of the eruption allowed for precise determination of the superhump period which was 0.08797(1 ) days and seemed to be constant throughout the entire superoutburst .",
    "other characteristics of the star showed that it resembles ordinary su uma stars rather than active er uma objects .",
    "table 1 presents the journal of our ccd observations of bf ara . in total",
    ", we observed the star for almost 31 hours on 15 nights and collected 666 exposures .",
    ".observational journal for the bf ara campaign .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a least - squares linear fit to these data gives the following ephemeris for the maxima :    @xmath14    and for the minima :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 .    taking these two determination of period of modulation and the value obtained from anova statistics ,",
    "we conclude that mean value of period was 0.082159(6 ) days .",
    "the @xmath17 values computed according to the ephemeris ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are listed in table 2 and also shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is clear that bf ara , during our run , showed a clear change of period .",
    "a second - order polynomial fit the to moments of maxima is expressed by the following ephemeris :    @xmath18    and for the moments of minima :    @xmath19    to use the information both from maxima and minima , we used times and @xmath17 values of minima , to construct virtual maxima .",
    "then a second - order polynomial fit was made again resulting in quadratic term of value equal to @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to the period derivative of @xmath21 which is with ideal agreement with value obtained in sect .",
    "first , we focus on modulation described in sect . 4.2 .",
    "its peak - to - peak amplitude is 0.15 mag and one of several acceptable period values is 0.084176(21 ) days .",
    "the corresponding modulation appears stable during our 15-days run ( see fig .",
    "we proceed to verify this period value whether it represents the orbital period of bf ara .       from their extensive observations of superhumps during superoutburst kato et al .",
    "( 2003 ) derived the superhump period @xmath22 .",
    "it is known , that in su uma stars the superhump and orbital periods , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , obey the stolz and schoembs ( 1984 ) relation .",
    "for this purpose one defines the superhump period excess as @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "6 we present a plot of superhump excess against the superhump period for all cvs with known orbital periods . for bf ara we considered periods of several aliases for the secondary modulation of sect  4.2 as tenative orbital periods and calculated the corresponding superhump excesses .",
    "all but one value obtained in this way deviated widely from the relation in fig .",
    "the only consistent value , @xmath26 corresponds to our proposed orbital period of bf ara and is plotted as filled square .",
    "it is clear that bf ara follows this relation perfectly , giving credit to our belief that the secondary small amplitude modulation reflects the orbital wave .",
    "it is also worth to mention that its value of @xmath27 minutes locates bf ara in the period gap .",
    "it has been established that the period excess in su uma stars correlates with the mass ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding relation may be approximated in the following way ( osaki 1985 ) :    @xmath29    thus the known period excess @xmath30 of bf ara can be used to estimate its mass ratio as @xmath31 .",
    "finaly , we decided to give the ephemeris for maxima and minima of orbital modulation .",
    "they are as follows :    @xmath32    @xmath33    the moments od maxima and minima were determined by fitting data from fig .",
    "5 with a fourier series up to @xmath34 and then finding its extrema .",
    "now we verify whether the permanent hump modulation discussed in sect .",
    "4.1 fits the negative hump pattern .",
    "its mean period was 0.082159(4 ) days , increasing at the rate of @xmath35 .",
    "the mean amplitude of this modulation was 0.7 mag and its mean shape is shown in fig .",
    "there are cataclysmic variables exhibiting three close periods of modulation : the orbital wave , ordinary superhumps and , additionally , so called negative superhumps .",
    "the periods of ordinary and negative humps , @xmath23 and @xmath36 are respectively longer and shorter than the orbital period @xmath37 .",
    "it is believed that negative superhumps arise due to the classical precession of a tilted accretion disk . according to wood and burke ( 2007 ) in these stars",
    "the accretion disk is tilted out of the orbital plane .",
    "the negative hump modulation is caused by migration of the hot spot across the face of the disk . without any tilt",
    ", the stream of accreted matter hits the edge of the disk roughly at the fixed distance from white dwarf in the orbital plane . for a tilted disc",
    "this situation happens only when the hot spot crosses the nodes of a disk . at other orbital phases stream",
    "misses outer parts of the disc , penetrating deeper in the gravitational potential well of the white dwarf .",
    "this in turn causes brightening of the bright spot . since only one face of the optically thick disk is visible ,",
    "only one brightening per orbit is observed .",
    "a slow retrograde precession of the tilted disk results in a period slightly shorter than the orbital period .",
    "positive and negative superhumps are observed in variety of objects . among them",
    "are double - degenerate systems such as am cvn ( skillman et al .",
    "1999 ) , ordinary su uma stars like v503 cyg ( harvey et al . 1995 ) , classical novae like v1974 cyg ( semeniuk et al .",
    "1995 , retter , leibowitz and ofek 1997 ) , x - ray systems containing neutron stars like v1405 aql ( retter et al .",
    "2002a ) and intermediate polars like tv col ( retter et al . 2002b ) .",
    "it is interesting that the super- and negative - hump periods in all objects seem to follow a unique relation .",
    "the respective period excess and defect are defined as @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "8 taken from retter et al .",
    "( 2002a ) we plot the defect and excess ratio @xmath40 against the orbital period .",
    "the picture suggests a unique relation .    from the observed the hump and orbital periods we determine the period defect of bf ara .",
    "it amounts to @xmath41 and yields the ratio of the positive and negative hump defect and excess @xmath42 .",
    "we added the corresponding point in fig .",
    "it fits very well the overall trend , adding credit to our interpretation of this modulation as the negative hump .    fitting a straight line to the points corresponding to individual variables",
    "one obtains the following relation :    @xmath43",
    "our main conclusions may be summarized as follows :    * light curve of bf ara in quiescence is dominated by high amplitude signal with mean period of 0.082159(4 ) days which during two weeks observing run increased at the rate of @xmath1 * we interpret this periodicity as being due to a negative superhump .",
    "such an interpretation is confirmed by the location of bf ara in the ritter et al .",
    "( 2002a ) relation , * bf ara seems to be a twin of v503 cyg ( harvey et al . , 1995 )",
    "- both stars are very active ( supercycles of 8090 days ) , both show large amplitude negative superhumps in quiescence characterized by changing value period , * prewhitening of the original light curve with the main periodicity resulted in the discovery of another modulation with constant period equal to 0.084176(21 ) days , which is interpreted as the orbital period of the system .",
    "this value makes bf ara another in - the - gap cataclysmic variable , * knowing the ordinary superhump period measured by kato et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we were able to calculate the period excess as equal to @xmath44 which indicates the mass ratio of @xmath4 .",
