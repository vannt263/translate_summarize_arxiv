    "the physics of correlated low dimensional systems is quite different than their higher dimensional counterparts . in three - dimensions ,",
    "the physics can be described within fermi liquid theory , that states that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the excitations of a weakly interacting fermi system , so - called quasi - particles , and the excitations of a non - interacting one .",
    "quasi - particles preserve the same quantum numbers as the original excitations in the original system .",
    "this scenario breaks down in one dimension ( 1d ) : in this case , the fermi surface reduces to two points in momentum space , at @xmath1 , and the resulting nesting , pervasive at all densities , prevents the application of perturbation theory .",
    "this leads to a new paradigm : the luttinger liquid @xcite . in a luttinger liquid ( ll ) ,",
    "the natural excitations are collective density fluctuations , that carry either spin ( `` spinons '' ) , or charge ( `` holons '' ) .",
    "these excitations have different dispersions , and obviously , do not carry the same quantum numbers as the original fermions .",
    "this leads to the spin - charge separation picture , in which a fermion injected into the system breaks down into excitations carrying different quantum numbers , each with a characteristic energy scale and velocity ( one for the charge , one for the spin ) .",
    "recently , a previously overlooked regime at finite temperature has come to light : the `` spin - incoherent luttinger liquid '' ( sill ) @xcite .",
    "if the spinon bandwidth is much smaller than the holon bandwidth , a small temperature relative to the fermi energy may actually be felt as a very large temperature by the spins .",
    "in fact , the charge will remain very close to the _ charge _ ground - state , but the spins will become totally incoherent , effectively at infinite temperature .",
    "this regime is characterized by universal properties in the transport , tunneling density of states , and the spectral functions @xcite .    in ref .",
    ", it was shown how this crossover from spin - coherent to spin - incoherent is characterized by a transfer of spectral weight .",
    "remarkably , the photoemission spectrum of the sill can be understood by assuming that after the spin is thermalized , the charge becomes spinless , with a shift of the fermi momentum from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . in a follow - up paper @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a coupling to a spin bath can have a similar effect as temperature , but in the ground - state .",
    "the `` spin - incoherent '' ground - state will have the same qualitative features as the sill at finite temperature . in this work",
    "we formalize this conjecture into a unified theory that describes the spin - incoherent ground - state for a variety of model hamiltonians , such as the @xmath0-kondo chain and @xmath0 ladders .",
    "the main ingredient for the validity of this theory is to have a very flat spinon dispersion , which corresponds to the limit in which spin and charge completely decouple from each other .",
    "this formalism is exact in this limit , and provides a new theoretical framework to understand spin - incoherent physics , including the structure of the kondo lattice ground - state and entanglement .",
    "we start our study by considering an isolated chain of strongly interacting fermions , described by a hubbard hamiltonian , or equivalently , by the @xmath0 model in one dimension : @xmath4 with the implicit constraint forbidding double - occupancy .",
    "here , @xmath5 creates an electron of spin @xmath6 on the @xmath7 site along a chain of length @xmath8 .",
    "the exchange energy is parametrized by @xmath9 , and we take the inter - atomic distance as unity .",
    "we express all energies in units of the hopping parameter @xmath10 .    in the @xmath11 limit",
    ", the ground - state of this hamiltonian can be described by the ogata and shiba s factorized wave - function @xcite , which is the product of a fermionic wave - function @xmath12 , and a spin wave function @xmath13 @xmath14 the first piece , @xmath12 , describes the charge degrees of freedom , and is simply the ground - state of a one - dimensional tight - binding chain of @xmath15 non - interacting spinless fermions .",
    "the spin wave - function @xmath13 corresponds to a `` squeezed '' chain of @xmath15 spins , where all the unoccupied sites have been removed . in this limit , the charge and the spin are governed by independent hamiltonians . since the spin energy scale is determined by @xmath9 , and for the rest of this work we take @xmath11 , the spin states are degenerate , and the charge dispersion becomes that of a non - interacting band @xmath16 .",
    "however , any finite value of @xmath9 will lift this degeneracy and give the spin excitations a finite bandwidth .",
    "notice that in finite systems , the spin degree of freedom affects the charge through an effective magnetic flux , which in the examples shown here is always identically zero @xcite .",
    "let us assume that we antiferromagnetically couple our chain to a bath of spins .",
    "regardless of the internal structure and dynamics of the bath , it is easy to realize that the charge will be in principle unaffected by it , while the spin degree of freedom will get entangled into a many - body state with the spins from the bath . if we trace over the bath , we expect the spins of the chain to be at an effective finite temperature , parametrized by the magnitude of the system - bath coupling ( even though the entire chain plus bath are in a pure state : the ground state of the hamiltonian ) . therefore , the spins of the chain can be driven incoherent by this interaction , while the charge remains in the ground - state .",
    "this physics is completely analogous to the sill physics at finite temperature .",
    "we should point out that the coupling with the bath may introduce a gap in the excitation spectrum , but it is to expect that in the regime of interest the gap would remain exponentially small , with the aforementioned picture basically unchanged ( whether there is a gap , and/or a critical value of couplings to open a gap is beyond the scope of this work ) . in ref .",
    "it was numerically shown that this physics is indeed realized in the @xmath0-kondo chain with strongly correlated conduction electrons , where the kondo impurities act as an effective spin bath . in this work",
    "we calculate the exact ground - state of this system in this limit , and also coupled @xmath0 chains , and we show that the structure of the ground - state is quite universal , and indicates the path toward a unified formalism to describe spin - incoherent behavior at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "let us assume two chains governed by the hamiltonian ( [ h_t - j ] ) , and we take the @xmath17 . in the limit in which the chains are independent",
    ", the exact ground - state will be that of two decoupled factorized wave - functions of the form ( [ gs ] ) : @xmath18 where the subindex @xmath19 refers to the chain index .",
    "now we introduce a small but finite antiferromagnetic interaction between the chains of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 parametrizes the interaction perpendicular to the direction of the chains , along the rungs of a ladder .",
    "this is equivalent to a @xmath0 ladder without inter - chain hopping .",
    "we acknowledge that this is a very idealized scenario , since the presence of exchange always implies the existence of a hopping , since @xmath22 .",
    "still , this could be considered a model for a two band problem with a hund coupling , as studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is to expect that this interaction will couple the spin pieces of the wave - function @xmath23 and @xmath24 , leaving the charge unaltered : @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the many body state of the spins for the two coupled chains , once they become entangled by action of the hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "it is also to expect that this state @xmath26 will be a singlet .",
    "however , the exact structure of this singlet is not necessarily trivial .    without attempting to deduce the exact effective hamiltonian for the spin sector",
    ", we shall propose a variational ansatz for the wave - function , that we later prove to be exact by numerical means .",
    "we argue that every time two spins interact on a rung via @xmath27 , they will become entangled forming a singlet . since the interaction along the chain is set to @xmath11 , these spins will remain entangled as they move apart from each other by action of the hopping term .",
    "therefore , this entanglement persists at infinite distance .",
    "if we consider a system with periodic boundary conditions , it is to expect that eventually all spins from one chain will interact with all the spins on the second chain . in a one dimensional system",
    ", they can not hop past each other , but in a chain with periodic boundary conditions , they can wind around the boundaries and come from the other side .",
    "therefore , we will have a superposition of singlets that connect all possible pairs of spins on both chains , and at all distances , with the same amplitude . in order to describe this wave - function",
    "it is useful to resort to a valence bond(vb ) picture @xcite .",
    "let us assume that each chain corresponds to a sublattice .",
    "then , our wave - function is the equal superposition of all possible valence - bond coverings connecting the two sublattices , as shown in figure [ fig : vb1 ] for the particular case of three electrons per chain .    in order to prove that our guess accurately describes the physics ,",
    "we have numerically computed the overlap between the exact ground - state and the variational ansatz on small systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we assumed @xmath28 and taken the number of particles not a multiple of @xmath29 , to avoid degeneracies .",
    "we show the results in figure [ fig : ladder](a ) , for different values of @xmath21 .",
    "the overlap is @xmath30 within numerical precision for a range of small values of @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath21 increases , we observe how this overlap becomes smaller , but still remains higher than @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "this range depends only on the number of conduction electrons @xmath15 , and tends to get smaller as the @xmath15 increases .    having shown that the ansatz is a good description of the spin - incoherent regime for @xmath33",
    ", we proceed to derive some straight - forward exact results that can be obtained using the variational form of the wave function . for a start",
    ", the entanglement between chains originates from the spin , and the charge does not contribute to it .",
    "one might feel inclined to think that spins are in a maximally entangled state .",
    "however , we should not forget that the vb basis is overcomplete , and in fact , the entanglement entropy is not @xmath34 , as one might expect for a state with @xmath15 singlets . using the exact wave - function it is relatively easy to obtain a closed expression for @xmath35 , as shown in the appendix : @xmath36 looking at this expression more closely , one realizes that this is equivalent to two spins @xmath37 in a maximally entangled state , instead of @xmath15 spins @xmath38 in a maximally entangled state ( see appendix ) . in figure [",
    "fig : ladder](b ) we show the entanglement entropy , normalized by the exact value for @xmath39 .",
    "same as the overlap , the expression holds for a range of @xmath21 , and @xmath35 increases as the charge becomes also entangled with the spin .",
    "it is enlightening to calculate the momentum distribution function ( mdf ) for the fermions : @xmath40 in order to estimate this quantity , we follow ref . and break the fermionic operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 into a spinless fermionic operators @xmath43,@xmath44 acting on the ( spinless ) charge part of the wave - function , and new operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 acting on the spin part of the wave - function .",
    "these spin operators have a very peculiar behavior : @xmath45 inserts a spin @xmath6 to the spin chain after skipping the first @xmath47 spins and makes it @xmath48 sites long , while @xmath46 has the opposite effect , shortening the chain .",
    "for instance , for the first site of the chain , we have : @xmath49 the generic expression for the operators can become more complicated , since to act with the @xmath50 operators on the spin chain , we need to count the number of charges on the spinless fermion chain .",
    "we refer the reader to refs . for details .",
    "the action of the operators @xmath51 is to move a fermion from site @xmath52 to site @xmath30 .",
    "if there are no particles in between , the spin wave - function will remain unchanged .",
    "if there is one or more particles in between , it is quite easy to realize that since the spin wave - function is the equal sum of all singlet coverings , it will also remain so after moving one of the ends of a singlet across any number of sites",
    ". therefore , the momentum distribution function reduces to @xmath53 which is nothing else but the mdf for spinless fermions . since the charge wave - function is that of non - interacting particles , we find that the excitations are free spinless fermions with quasi - particle weight @xmath54 , and fermi momentum @xmath3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdf](a ) we show the mdf calculated for large systems using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite , indicating that the quasi - particle weight may remain finite for a range of @xmath21 .",
    "we have to concede that since the calculations are on finite - systems with @xmath55 sites and @xmath56 electrons per chain , we can not argue with full certainty that the discontinuity at @xmath57 is not actually a singularity , and this remains an interesting problem to pursue .",
    "we consider a kondo chain in which the conduction electrons strongly interact , and are described by hamiltonian ( [ h_t - j ] ) . at the same time , the electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to localized impurities via an exchange @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 describes the conduction spins and @xmath61 the localized spins .",
    "it is easy to see that this is equivalent to the two coupled chains , in which one of them is at half - filling .",
    "curiously , this model has not received much attention in the literature .",
    "it has been shown that in the limit of @xmath62 , any infinitesimal @xmath58 will yield a ferromagnetic ground - state@xcite , in which the localized impurities are underscreened : the @xmath15 conduction spins will screen @xmath15 impurity spins , and the remaining `` unpaired '' impurities will be in a ferromagnetic state with maximum spin @xmath63 .",
    "notice that this means that the paramagnetic state with a large fermi surface is totally suppressed in this regime .",
    "this state will be a multiplet , and for convenience we focus on the configuration with projection @xmath64 . following a similar reasoning as in the previous section , we argue that the @xmath15 conduction electrons will form the same vb state as the one described before , while the unpaired impurities will all point in the same direction .",
    "the polarized spins can sit on any site of the lattice with equal probability .",
    "therefore , our ansatz can be written as : @xmath65 where @xmath26 is the vb wave function , and @xmath66 indicates the positions of the unpaired polarized spins : @xmath67 this wave - function is the sum with equal amplitude of all the configurations @xmath68 of @xmath69 particles in @xmath8 sites .",
    "figure [ fig : kondo](a ) shows the overlap between the exact and variational ground - states , and we again observe identical behavior as the @xmath0 ladder . the vb basis for this problem is overcomplete , and we also have to account for the unpaired polarized spins , as shown schematically in figure [ fig : vb2 ] .",
    "this generalization can be easily carried out@xcite , and it is still straightforward to obtain a closed expression for the entropy , which is slightly more complicated than the one for the coupled chains .",
    "we show results in figure [ fig : kondo](b ) , which have strong resemblance with those for the ladder .",
    "the calculation of the mdf is strictly the same as before and the results are identical for @xmath70 .",
    "notice however , that unlike the @xmath0 ladder , the mdf for up and down spins will be different , and only the sum of the two will be the same .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : mdf](b),(c ) , and ( d ) .",
    "in particular , there is a striking difference between the mdf for the majority up and minority down electrons .",
    "the up electrons present a clear discontinuity at the fermi level , while the down electrons display the behavior of a luttinger liquid with zero quasi - particle weight .",
    "the sum of the two , shown in figure [ fig : mdf](b ) of course hides these interesting features .",
    "this resembles the behavior of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) polarized paired state in one dimension@xcite .",
    "however , the physics of our problem is quite different , since only the spin entangles , and not the charge . we would rather call this state a `` half - fermi - liquid '' , or `` half - luttinger - liquid '' . whether these are finite - size artifacts or not , undoubtedly , it is a problem that requires further study .",
    "we point out again that the shift to a larger momentum in the mdf should not be confused with a large fermi surface , that is a feature of the _ paramagnetic _ phase of the kondo lattice .",
    "we have presented a ground - state ansatz for antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath0 chains , and the @xmath0-kondo chain that is numerically exact in the limit of @xmath11 ( corresponding to infinite-@xmath71 hubbard chains ) , and coupling to the bath @xmath72 , as tested on small systems . moreover , our dmrg results indicate that the variational wave functions describe the physics of the problem in a range of @xmath21 and @xmath58 . in this regime , the charge and the spin can be considered to a good extent as separate degrees of freedom with independent dynamics : the charge can be described as non - interacting spinless fermions in the ground - state , while the spin is entangled into a vb - like state where all valence bond coverings have the same weight .",
    "the inter - chain coupling @xmath21 and the kondo interaction @xmath58 parametrize an effective _ spin _ temperature .",
    "if we trace over the bath , the spins of an isolated chain will be in equilibrium at a certain `` quasi - spin temperature '' .",
    "this spin temperature is not infinite , since we have proven that the spin is not maximally entangled .",
    "however , this state seems to correspond to a fine - tuned point in which excitations can be described as free spinless fermions .",
    "the momentum distribution functions show a discontinuity at @xmath3 indicating that the system is no longer a luttinger liquid . however , it is noteworthy to point out the peculiar behavior of the @xmath0-kondo chain .",
    "since it has a polarized ferromagnetic ground - state , the up and down fermions behave notoriously different : at finite @xmath58 , the minority spins show a luttinger liquid - like behavior , while the majority fermions appear as almost free particles .",
    "notice that the ground - state of the @xmath0-kondo chain is a spin multiplet , and this `` half - luttinger - liquid '' behavior in the @xmath0-kondo chain may be an artifact of working on the maximally polarized state .",
    "however , we believe that this physics deserves further investigation .    in the ferromagnetic phase of the conventional kondo chain , the natural excitations are spin - polarons formed by a conduction electron and impurities forming a bound state that propagates coherently @xcite . in our scenario , charges and impurities can not form a bound state because the charge decouples completely from the spin . however , the spin of the electrons remains entangled with the impurities at all distances , but this does not imply an effective potential acting on the charges that can still move freely .",
    "an interesting observation is that even though the hamiltonians are local and the charge degree of freedom is totally uncorrelated , the spins remain correlated at _ infinite distance _ , and the spin - spin correlations between chains are constant at all distances ( see appendix ) .",
    "the introduced wave - functions establish a framework to study spin - incoherent behavior in systems with spin - charge separation .",
    "normally considered a finite - temperature scenario , this physics can also be realized at zero temperature , once the system is coupled to external spin degrees of freedom .",
    "it is not restricted to the models used in this work for illustration , but the theory can be easily extended and generalized to other cases , such as an arbitrary number of coupled @xmath0 chains , for instance @xcite .",
    "we point out that even though our study applies to systems with periodic boundary conditions , same ideas apply to problems with open boundary conditions . in that case",
    ", we expect the vb wave - function to be quite different , with only the first kind of configurations shown in figure [ fig : vb1 ] carrying most of the weight , and a consequent entanglement entropy @xmath73 corresponding to infinite effective spin temperature @xcite .",
    "contrary to other problems studied with vb - type variational wave - functions @xcite , the accuracy of our ansaetze seems to depend primarily on the number of particles @xmath15 , and not the size of the chains @xmath8 , which may suggest that our description will still be valid for large systems , as long as the density is sufficiently small . yet",
    ", our dmrg results a quarter - filling still display the same physics . in any case , one has to keep in mind that our considerations are strictly valid in the limit @xmath74 .",
    "an important issue that we have not addressed in this paper is the nature of the actual spin hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the spins .",
    "this is an interesting problem and for the moment it remains open .",
    "we thank a. aligia , c. batista , f. essler , g. fiete , a. sandvik , and m. troyer for stimulating discussions and useful comments .",
    "aef is grateful to nsf for funding under grant dmr-0955707 .",
    "in this section we calculate the entanglement entropy between the conduction electrons in one chain , and the bath . in the @xmath0 ladder ,",
    "the bath is modeled by a second chain , while in the @xmath0 kondo model , by localized impurities . as illustrated in figures [ fig : vb1 ] and [ fig : vb2 ] , we squeeze the chain by removing all the unoccupied sites , reducing the configuration space to a spin problem with no charge . in these cartoons , the black dots and white dots will be referred to as a and b sub - lattices .",
    "each sublattice will have @xmath15 sites , instead of @xmath8 , where @xmath15 is the number of electrons in the chain .",
    "we start by considering the @xmath0 ladder , in which both sublattices have the same number of sites , and the ground - state is represented by all possible vb coverings connecting the two . instead of using the overcomplete vb basis for the calculation",
    ", we will work in the space of spin configurations . in this basis",
    ", the states can be classified by the number @xmath75 of down spins in sublattice a. since the total spins projection @xmath76 is conserved , this also fixes the number of down spins on sublattice b. the coefficient in front of each configuration is then given by @xmath77 which counts the number of times each of them is repeated in the ground - state , times a sign arising from the singlets ( we have ignored the normalization for the time being ) .",
    "the von neumann entanglement entropy @xmath35 is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the reduced density matrix for sublattice a , obtained by tracing over the states on sublattice b. it is easy to see that @xmath79 can be separated into blocks , each labeled by @xmath75 . since @xmath75 can assume values @xmath80 , the number of such blocks is @xmath48 .",
    "the linear dimension for each block is given by the number of possible arrangements of @xmath75 spins in @xmath15 sites : @xmath81    it is easy to see that , since all configurations with fixed @xmath75 will appear with the same coefficient , each block will have all matrix elements equal to @xmath82 : @xmath83 this matrix has only a single non - zero eigenvalue @xmath84 , the same for all blocks . finally , the full matrix has to be normalized such that @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath48 blocks , each with a single non - zero eigenvalue @xmath86 . hence , the entanglement entropy ( [ s_a ] ) is given by : @xmath87 which is our final result .",
    "this expression is equivalent to two spins @xmath37 in a maximally entangled state , where each spin is obtained by the addition of the @xmath15 spins @xmath38 of each sublattice .",
    "this analogy can be made rigorous by observing that the spin wave - function is the ground - state of the hamiltonian : @xmath88 with @xmath89 , and a similar expression for sublattice b. the ground state is a singlet of two spins @xmath37 , a maximally entangled state .",
    "notice that this is not the actual spin hamiltonian for the coupled @xmath0 chains , since the spectra are different .",
    "now we can make use of this solution to calculate the spin - spin correlations .",
    "the hamiltonian can be re - written as : @xmath90.\\ ] ] from this expression , we obtain the ground - state energy : @xmath91 since all the correlators should be equal , we find : @xmath92 in order to calculate the correlations in the actual @xmath0 ladder we need to include the charge contribution : @xmath93 which indicates that the correlations saturate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the calculation for the @xmath0-kondo lattice follows identical steps , except that since the b sublattice has @xmath8 sites , the degeneracy for each sector acquires a slightly more elaborate form : @xmath94    in this case , the single non - zero eigenvalues for each sector are given by : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the number of configurations in the b sublattice , for each configuration of the a sublattice . since the eigenvalues are different for each sector , the normalization and the entropy are obtained by adding numerically over the @xmath48 blocks ."
