    "this effect arises as the interplay between an initial state and a channel that annihilates any entanglement that one could try to establish through it @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the j - ch isomorphism where there is a one to one correspondence between the target state and a unilateral channel , here the combination of a channel and a pure state is not unique : an arbitrary mixed state @xmath19 can be written as :    @xmath21    with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are two distinct pure states .",
