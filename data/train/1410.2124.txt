    "until recently , dwarf galaxies were thought to be fundamentally different from globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "however , the recognition that many , if not all , gcs contain multiple populations @xcite and that some of the most massive clusters may be the remnants of dissipated dwarf galaxies @xcite has blurred the differences somewhat . when considering the build - up of the halo of our own galaxy , its chemical evolution is likely to be intimately intertwined with that of the gcs and accreting dwarf galaxies .",
    "the first high resolution spectra for a handful of stars in nearby dsphs @xcite disclosed a systematic difference in the chemical enrichment law compared to the halo stars .",
    "this implies that the building blocks of the halo can not resemble the _",
    "present day _ galaxy satellites , unless the merging events occurred very early on , before the internal chemical evolution driven by supernova enrichment took place . on the other hand , it has recently been suggested that gcs might be responsible for a significant fraction of the halo stars observed today @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the gcs formed two or more generations of stars , on a short time scale , of the order of few hundred myr , and the first supernovae would be responsible for a significant mass loss from the clusters , causing the evaporation of a large fraction of the first generation stars ; these would build up part of the galaxy halo .",
    "hence , a detailed knowledge of the chemical evolution of nearby dwarfs and a comparison with gcs can give important insight on the progenitors of our own galaxy .",
    "ideally , we would like to collect high resolution spectroscopy for large samples of stars to faint magnitudes in conjunction with accurate photometry .",
    "however for lg galaxies the former is technically at present beyond our means and only typically the brightest stars in the closer galaxies have such data .",
    "deep photometry alone suffers from the long - standing problem of the photometric colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) having an age - metallicity degeneracy that affects the advanced evolutionary phases such as the red giant branch ( rgb ) , where sequences of different age - metallicity combinations occupy the same region of the cmd and therefore can not be easily disentangled .",
    "interestingly , recent results revealed that the different stellar populations in old gcs can be easily isolated along the whole cmd , from the main sequence ( ms ) , up to the subgiant branch ( sgb ) , rgb , and even the horizontal branch by using an appropriate combination of broad band filters @xcite .",
    "monelli et al .",
    "( 2013 ) showed that the @xmath2  = @xmath3 index is a powerful tool to identify multiple stellar sequences in the rgb of old gcs , and that the @xmath2  pseudo - colour of rgb stars correlates with the chemical abundances of light elements .",
    "in this paper we test the same approach successfully used for gcs for the first time in a dwarf galaxy .",
    "since the established nomenclature can be somehow confusing , it has to be clearly stated that when we refer the stellar populations in a dwarf galaxy , in particular the dsph satellites of the milky way , these have substantially different properties from multiple populations in gcs .",
    "first , the typical main star formation event in a dwarf galaxy occurred on time scales of the order of few gyr , significantly longer than the age difference between two generations of stars in a gc ( few hundred myr at most ) .",
    "moreover , the chemical evolution is different . in particular ,",
    "the large spread in fe observed in dwarf galaxies has no counterpart in a typical gc . in these systems ,",
    "the internal chemical enrichment affected only the light elements involved in the high temperature h burning processes , while typically no spread in fe , is found .",
    "in this paper we focus on the properties of stellar population in the carina dsph , for which an extensive database of both photometric @xcite and spectroscopic @xcite data is available .",
    "nevertheless , we still lack a definitive understanding of its bursty star formation history @xcite , unique in the local group , and of the chemical enrichment history of its different stellar populations .",
    "in fact , accurate analysis of high - quality photometry revealed that carina experienced two main events of star formation , separated by a quiescent phase lasting few gyr , which produced two well separated sgbs .",
    "one corresponds to an old population ( @xmath610 gyr ) containing approximately one third of the total number of stars , while the second belongs to an intermediate  age population made of @xmath04 - 8 gyr - old stars @xcite .",
    "the two sgbs merge in a narrow rgb , making it difficult to associate the individual iron abundances with the discrete sgb and main sequence @xcite , observed in the cmd .",
    "this represents a major challenge to understanding the complex star formation history and the chemical evolution of the carina dsph .",

    "the plot demonstrates a nicely cleaned cmd showing well - defined evolutionary sequences , in particular , the two well separated turn - offs and sgbs representing the old and intermediate  age populations , merging into the thin rgb .",
    "the few remaining field stars populate an almost vertical sequence at colour @xmath15 mag ( cyan symbols for the brightest ones ) .",
    "these stars are virtually impossible to clean even using a colour - colour plane , because their position is almost indistinguishable from the carina to stars .",
    "note that most of the stars bluer than the field sequence and brighter than @xmath16 mag are anomalous cepheids of carina @xcite .",
    "the orange crosses mark the faint part of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars sequence .",
    "the right panel of the same figure shows the ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 ) pseudo - cmd of carina . as discussed in detail by monelli et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the features in the ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 ) diagram are reversed compared to a standard cmd , at least in the metallicity range covered by the carina stars .",
    "the @xmath2  of ms stars gets larger ( i.e. , less negative ) as the stars get brighter , and after the turn - off the stars evolve to lower index values along the two sgbs . in this plane",
    "the two rgbs do not totally merge in a single , narrow sequence , as happens in standard optical cmds .",
    "although some degree of overlap is present for @xmath17 @xmath2  @xmath18 mag , it is possible to follow the two rgb sequences which remain well - defined , and run almost vertically and parallel from the sgb to the tip of the rgb . in particular ,",
    "the rgb stars with more negative @xmath2  are a sequitur of the sgb of the old population , while the more densely populated , higher @xmath2  side of the rgb is the sequitur of the intermediate  age population . only at the brightest magnitudes ( @xmath19 mag ) the two sequences diverge slightly .",
    "we stress that the photometric error is of the order of few hundredths of magnitude along the whole rgb , and therefore can not account for the observed spread in the @xmath2index .",
    "note that the contamination due to field stars is negligible across the rgb , while in this plane the majority of agb stars overlie the rgb sequences .",
    "for this reason , the latter have been removed from the following analysis .    to better characterize these two rgb sequences",

    "bona - fide rgb stars are shown as black open circles ( left and central panels ) , while the red line , drawn by eye , is intended to represent the right edge of their distribution .",
    "our selection includes only stars in the magnitude range @xmath20 mag .",
    "nevertheless , we verified that the following analysis is minimally affected , within 1@xmath21 , by both the exact location of the envelope and the limit magnitude .",
    "the rgb was rectified with respect to the red line , which is the origin of the abscissas in the central panel .",
    "this shows , for each star , the distance in colour @xmath22@xmath2  from the red line .",
    "finally , the right panel presents the distribution of the @xmath22@xmath2   ( grey histogram ) .",
    "the shape of the global distribution is best fitted by the sum ( black line ) of the two superimposed gaussian curves ( green and magenta lines ) , whose peaks are separated by @xmath00.08 mag .",
    "this indicates that a simple photometric index such as the @xmath2  is able to largely separate , for the first time , the two main components along the rgb of carina .",
    "in particular , we conclude that stars with @xmath2  @xmath23 mag ) , belong to the old population , while stars with less negative index values are predominantly intermediate  age .",
    "we verified this finding by considering only kinematically selected stars , adopting the sample of rgb stars from @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : kinem ] , which is a replica of figure [ fig : cubi2 ] with superimposed 413 rgb stars with radial velocity consistent with that of carina . by adopting the selection from @xcite and retaining stars with radial velocities within 4@xmath21 from the mean value , in the range + 180 to + 260 km s@xmath24 , the occurrence of a double peak in the pseudo - colour distribution due to the two main carina populations",

    "overall , c and n abundances are yet not available .",
    "these can be crucial elements , as the overall c+n+o abundance significantly influences the luminosity of the sgb and hence affects the age determinations of the different populations @xcite .",
    "measurement of the overall c+n+o content of intermediate  age and old stars in carina is mandatory to properly estimate the age of its stellar populations and thus to properly calibrate the chemical enrichment history .",
    "following the referee s suggestion , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubi_age ] a comparison with literature values , in particular the metallicity ( top panel ) and the age ( bottom ) .",
    "the top panel shows the @xmath89@xmath2  diagram , with highlighted in green and magenta the two groups of stars selected in  [",
    "sec : spec ] .",
    "the starred symbols show the 35 stars by @xcite , while the squares the 44 stars by ( 11 objects in common * ? ? ?",
    "* ) colour - coded as labeled .",
    "the above data indicate that the most metal - poor stars attain the lowest @xmath2   values , and fall on the rgb sequence identified by the green circles .",
    "on the other hand , stars more metal - rich then [ fe / h]@xmath902 , attain larger @xmath2  values , and all but three fall on the other sequence identified by the magenta circles .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cubi_age ] shows once again the two groups of stars selected in  [ sec : spec ] in green and in magenta together with the 35 stars by @xcite . the spectroscopic sample by @xcite was not plotted in this panel , because the authors did not provide an individual age estimate .",
    "interestingly , we found that the most metal - poor stars also have the largest age ( saturated at 15 gyr ) .",
    "this implies that all but one of these objects are located in the lowest @xmath2  sequence , which we identify with the rgb of the old population .",
    "similarly , all the intermediate  age stars ( t @xmath50 8 gyr ) cluster in the region of the higher @xmath2  stars . on the other hand , starred symbols plotted with greenish colour , with estimated ages between @xmath08 and @xmath011 gyr , attain a @xmath2  index ranging from @xmath91 to @xmath92 mag . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that the current comparison does not allow us to reach a firm conclusion concerning the objects with ages ranging from 8 to 11 gyrs .",
    "the reasons are manifold .",
    "the uncertainty associated to the individual ages of rg stars is at least of the order of 2 gyr @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on the individual iron abundance is at least of the order of 0.1 dex @xcite .",
    "the sample is limited and these objects are located across the boundary adopted to split the old and the intermediate  age population .",
    "[ fig : deltacubi_age ] shows the same [ fe / h ] abundance ( top ) and age ( bottom ) as a function of the @xmath22@xmath2  index , with the same colour code adopted for metallicity in the top panel of in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubi_age ] .",
    "the above figures suggest a segregation , in the sense that stars with more negative @xmath22@xmath2  are systematically older and more metal - poor than those with higher index .",
    "this further strengthens the use of @xmath2  and @xmath22@xmath2to separate stars from different populations .",
    "however , this result should be cautiously treated , since other parameters together with age and iron content are necessary to fully characterize the properties of the carina stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] and  [ sec : gc ] ) .",
    "this means that the comparison between isochrones and cmd along the rgb might be affected by possible systematic effects .",
    "the anonymous referee noted that the correlation between age and metallicity is a thorny problem of the carina dsph , since the two main episodes of star formation show a well defined separation of the order of 3 - 4 gyrs .",
    "according to the recent literature , the age distribution of the two main stellar population in carina cover a broad range in age @xcite .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the adopted stellar isochrones and to the diagnostic adopted to constrain the age ( msto v@xmath45 red giants ) .",
    "unfortunately , we still lack firm theoretical and empirical constraints to assess whether the carina star formation episodes were affected by the interaction with the galaxy @xcite however , the above uncertainties do not affect our conclusions , since we are only using relative ages to separate the old and the intermediate ",
    "age stellar populations .",
    "the quoted problems do not apply to the other satellite dsphs , such as sculptor , showing a well defined age ",
    "metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "this stellar system appears as a fundamental benchmark to further constrain the use of the @xmath2index to identify distinct stellar populations .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the stellar populations in carina adopting an observational approach that has been successfully used to study multiple populations in gcs .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    @xmath93 the use of the @xmath2  pseudo - colour allows the discrimination between old and intermediate  age populations .",
    "the new purely photometric diagnostic allows us in breaking the severe age - metallicity degeneracy along a significant portion of the rgb of this stellar system .",
    "in particular , we are able to clearly follow the evolutionary sequence of the old and of the intermediate  age populations for at least three magnitudes along the rgb .",
    "this approach is fully supported by the analysis sample of bona - fide carina stars selected according to their radial velocity .",
    "+ @xmath93 by comparing with published spectroscopy , we found a significant correlation between the @xmath2  index of rgb stars and their iron content .",
    "this conclusion is supported by three independent samples of spectroscopic measurements .",
    "we derive that the mean metallicity of the old population is on average 0.5 dex lower than the intermediate ",
    "+ @xmath93 a comparison with theoretical models demonstrates that current isochrones calculated for a standard heavy - element mixture can not reproduce the observed distribution of stars in the ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 ) plane .",
    "+ @xmath93 the appearance of carina rgbs in different cmds significantly differs from what is observed for multiple populations within gcs .",
    "+ the comparison between theoretical models and observations indicates that the rgb bimodality disclosed by @xmath2  can not be explained on the basis of a difference in age and/or in fe abundance only . in dealing with mono - metallic gcs , the split of the different sub - populations",
    "is currently explained as the combination of light - element ( mainly c , n , o ) and helium variations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very likely a possible difference in c , n , o and probably helium between the old and young population , combined with metallicity and age effects , can be also responsible of the observed rgb bimodality in carina . however , in the case of carina there are no measurements for most of these elements . in addition , while in gcs c , n , o abundances are connected with well - known correlations and anticorrelations the pattern of c , n , o variation in this dwarf is largely unexplored ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the empirical scenario is still limited by both accuracy and statistics .",
    "detailed knowledge of the chemical pattern in dwarf galaxies , especially in comparison with gcs , is very important to constrain the chemical evolution in the milky way environment .",
    "the techniques shown here could be very promising for breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy in the cmds of stellar systems with complex star formation history , and should be tested in different systems .",
    "in particular , comparing carina with other galaxies having different star formation histories , such as the purely old ones ( draco , ursa minor , sculptor ) and those with extended star formation ( fornax , leo  i ) would be particularly valuable .",
