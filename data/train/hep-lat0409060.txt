    "at @xmath0 the physics of a dilute gas is characterized by just two length scales : the interparticle spacing @xmath1 and the s wave scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "the range of interactions is very small compared to the average interparticle spacing @xmath3 , so only 2-body s wave scattering is important . by varying an external magnetic field experimentalists",
    "can get a trapped fermi gas with any scattering length .",
    "( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the scattering length , the ground state of cold fermi gases can be very different .",
    "in two extreme cases , theoretical expansions in @xmath4 are valid . if there is a deep 2-fermion bound state ( _ i.e. _  if @xmath5 ) then the fermion molecules form a bose einstein condensate ( bec ) at low temperatures .",
    "if there is no 2-body bound state ( @xmath6 ) then delocalized cooper pairs condense in a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid .",
    "what is the ground state for fermions when @xmath7 is large ?",
    "no perturbative expansion converges for @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite is the only first principles approach for theoretical calculation with @xmath9 .",
    "the case where @xmath10 is especially interesting since systems should then exhibit universal behavior .",
    "below we summarize the proposal of chen and kaplan @xcite . consider 2 species of nonrelativistic fermions , @xmath11 , with a local 4-fermion interaction with finite chemical potential @xmath12 @xmath13",
    "the 2 species can be envisioned as spin degrees - of - freedom , although in the atomic gases they are two hyperfine states .    in order to perform simulations",
    "we must make the lagrangian quadratic in the fermion field by introducing an auxiliary real scalar field @xmath14 so that @xmath15 where we identify @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "now one introduces a source for the fermion pairing , a necessary step to study spontaneous symmetry breaking in a finite volume @xmath18 ~=~ { \\cal l } \\;+\\ ; \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( j\\,\\psi^t\\sigma_2 \\psi \\;+\\ ; j^*\\,\\overline{\\psi}\\,\\sigma_2\\ , \\overline{\\psi}^t \\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] combining @xmath19 and @xmath20 into a 4-component majorana fermion , @xmath21 , the action can be written in terms of @xmath22 matrices as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 @xmath25 $ ] represents the fermion kinetic energy and interaction terms , and it is the only @xmath26 block to contain nontrivial spacetime terms .",
    "the only coupling between species is through the @xmath27 blocks .",
    "the partition function can be seen to have a real , nonnegative integrand : @xmath28 & = & \\int [ d\\phi][d\\psi ] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi^t{\\cal a}\\psi\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int [ d\\phi ] \\;{\\mathrm{det}}\\left[|j|^2 +   \\tilde{k}^\\dagger\\tilde{k}\\right ] \\;e^{-m^2\\phi^2/2 }   \\label{eq : z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 defines the @xmath30 matrix @xmath31 .",
    "we can perform monte carlo simulations of ( [ eq : z ] ) using hybrid monte carlo .",
    "we have 3 lattice parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath32 which control the physical quantities @xmath2 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ( ignoring finite @xmath35 and setting @xmath36 fixed ) .",
    "@xmath37 is matched to the ratio @xmath38 at @xmath39 by requiring 2-body scattering amplitude to match the leading term in the effective range expansion as in pionless nuclear effective field theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 is mainly controlled by tuning @xmath12 . in a nonrelativistic theory ,",
    "the fermion mass can be scaled away by rescaling the time coordinate , so it can be interpreted as the anisotropy . for fixed @xmath36 , increasing @xmath32 shortens the temporal length , increasing @xmath34 .",
    "some parts of parameter space do not describe the physics of a dilute fermi gas . in a continuum theory with a local attractive interaction ,",
    "the vacuum is unstable .",
    "since we are not interested in physics at short distances , we simply have to regulate the theory . in our case",
    ", the lattice automatically provides a cutoff ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mfinstability ] ) .",
    "the continuum limit is defined as the limit where physical correlation lengths @xmath40 , become infinitely large compared to the lattice spacing @xmath41 .",
    "this limit can only be taken using simulations where one finds @xmath42 at the same time that @xmath37 is tuned to 0 .",
    "figure [ fig : density_ainv ] shows @xmath43 ( in lattice units ) at @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 ) which is necessary and sufficient for a continuum limit to exist .",
    "@xmath33 is nonzero there due to finite @xmath46 and @xmath47 effects . as @xmath48 , a rise in @xmath33",
    "is observed .",
    "it would be satisfying to be able to increase @xmath37 enough so that we observe the artificial first - order transition to the filled - lattice state , but the hmc algorithm is becoming less efficient in this direction . for larger values of @xmath37 than plotted ,",
    "6000 hmc trajectories were not enough to equilibrate the lattice . the breakdown of the hmc algorithm is known from simulations of the hubbard model .",
    "indeed the physics in the uninteresting ( from our perspective ) region of parameter space is exactly that of the 3d attractive hubbard model .",
    "having established the existence of a continuum limit in the interesting part of parameter space , searching for the uninteresting region is not a priority .",
    "at low temperatures we expect condensation of fermion pairs , breaking the global u(1 ) symmetry of fermion number conservation .",
    "the order parameter is @xmath49 figure  [ fig : order ] shows @xmath50 as a function of @xmath47 for several values of @xmath32 .",
    "extrapolating to @xmath51 linearly indicates the vanishing of the order parameter as @xmath32 increases .",
    "the validity of the linear extrapolations is under study , since we expect finite volume errors to increase as @xmath47 decreases @xcite .",
    "the results of this exploratory study show this lattice theory can describe the physics of dilute fermi gases .",
    "these simulations show a continuum limit exists : it is defined by @xmath52 with fixed @xmath53 .",
    "study of the critical temperature has begun .",
    "the first point on the critical line has been located in the space of lattice parameters @xmath54 .",
    "the critical line can then be mapped to the physical space @xmath55 . for precision results",
    ", one will have to repeat these steps for increasing volumes and decreasing lattice spacings .",
    "however , even with finite size and spacing effects , understanding the behavior of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 will be an important accomplishment .",
