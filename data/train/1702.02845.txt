    "the extension to @xmath5 separated mbss gives rise to a @xmath6-fold degenerate ground - state manifold .",
    "these ground states are candidates for applications in quantum information processing ( qip ) , where the spatial separation between mbss provides a topological protection mechanism against decoherence @xcite .",
    "most proposals for implementing majorana - based qip rely on non - abelian braiding operations in the degenerate ground - state manifold   @xcite .",
    "a recent alternative approach suggests the engineering of patterns of low - capacitance mesoscopic superconducting islands harboring mbss  @xcite , where the ensuing two - dimensional ( 2d ) majorana surface code @xcite defines a topologically ordered abelian state of matter .",
    "the fundamental design advantage of the surface code is that only modest fidelities @xmath7 are required for elementary gate operations @xcite .",
    "however , all approaches to majorana - based qip have in common that they rely on the realizability of robust and easily manipulable mbss , which in turn define the hardware qubits of the corresponding architecture . in particular",
    ", one must be able to initialize , manipulate , and read out the corresponding qubit states in a phase - coherent environment while facing the challenge of scalability to 2d extended structures .    currently , two platforms are intensely studied and hold promise to meet these criteria .",
    "the first builds on spin - orbit - coupled semiconductor ( inas or insb ) nanowires proximitized by @xmath8-wave superconductors ( al or nbtin ) , where evidence for mbs formation has already been seen in zero - bias conductance peaks @xcite and in coulomb blockade spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the second platform employs 1d edge states of the layered quantum spin hall insulator hgte proximitized by nb @xcite .",
    "both platforms offer specific advantages but also face specific challenges .",
    "for instance , while the semiconductor approach benefits from decades of experience in device technology it is confined to mbss realized in narrowly defined parameter regimes close to the bottom of a semiconductor band @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative majorana qubit architecture and outline how to implement basic qip operations in it .",
    "our setup employs nanoribbons of 3d topological insulator ( ti ) materials , e.g. , bi@xmath9se@xmath10 or bi@xmath9te@xmath10 , proximitized by conventional @xmath8-wave superconductors .",
    "surface states of proximitized tis are expected to realize topological superconductors @xcite , and theoretical work has predicted the formation of mbss near the ends of such ribbons @xcite .",
    "since these mbss are built from protected surface states of a bulk topological insulator , they are expected to show high levels of robustness . although no experimental evidence for mbss in this material class has been reported yet , we are positive that there is no fundamental obstacle preventing success along that direction . below we will describe a tunable majorana qubit realization using this platform and outline how to perform simple quantum operations with it .",
    "the layered structure of most tis implies that 1d nanowires formed from such materials grow in a tape - like shape . for the ensuing nanoribbons , rather small cross sections ( @xmath11  nm@xmath12 @xcite ) are feasible , where surface states located on opposite sides of the nanoribbon still have a finite overlap .",
    "the corresponding surface state bands are inside the bulk ti energy gap of width @xmath13  ev @xcite . in general , however , they exhibit a finite - size gap because of this overlap . remarkably , the presence of an axial magnetic flux , @xmath14 , equal to half a flux quantum , @xmath15 , may close this finite - size gap . in practice ,",
    "the application of a magnetic field of order @xmath16  t is expected to generate a single gapless 1d mode @xcite .",
    "this helical 1d mode is insensitive to elastic impurity scattering and experimental efforts towards the confirmation of its existence have been made @xcite .",
    "once a ti nanoribbon with @xmath17 is proximitized by an @xmath8-wave superconductor , a 1d topological superconductor phase with majorana end states emerges @xcite .",
    "conceptually , these mbss form under conditions of symmetry class @xmath18 , where spin su@xmath19 symmetry , time reversal symmetry , and particle number conservation are all broken @xcite , and they are robust against both conventional and pair - breaking disorder .",
    "importantly , they also tolerate arbitrary chemical potentials located in the bulk band gap .",

    "[ figure1 ] for a schematic illustration .",
    "the narrowed central region might be fabricated by electron beam lithography and wet etching in order to minimize defects .",
    "its reduced cross section implies that it is threaded by a magnetic flux lower than @xmath21 , and therefore exhibits a size quantization gap in its surface state spectrum .",
    "majorana bound states then form at the interfaces between regions of different ( superconducting vs size quantization ) spectral gap type , where the gate - tunable weak link represents a josephson junction between two topologically superconducting wires .    as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , using either floating or grounded versions of the device in fig .  [ figure1 ] , a variety of means to access and manipulate quantum states encoded by the four mbss are available .",

    "specifically , the application of a given pauli operator   to a state @xmath157 can be realized through the pumping of a single electron between a pair of quantum dots ( or single - electron transistors ) tunnel - coupled to the mbss corresponding to the operator  @xcite . here , the dots are assumed to be in the single - occupancy regime , where the respective energy levels can be changed by means of gate voltages .",
    "the pumping of a single electron from dot @xmath143 then implies a unitary state transformation , @xmath158 , where @xmath159 corresponds to the respective pauli operator .",
    "this transformation law is topologically robust in the sense that it is independent of details of the protocol @xcite .",
    "for instance , it does not depend on the values of the tunnel couplings nor on the precise time dependence of gate voltages .",
    "however , it has to be made sure that the electron ends up in the desired final state , either by a confirmation measurement of the dot charge or by running the protocol in an adiabatically slow fashion .",
    "finally , also pairs of dots may be connected by additional phase - coherent reference arms to effectively realize arbitrary single - qubit phase gates . however , in contrast to the pauli operators discussed above , such phase gates generally are not topologically protected anymore due to measurement - induced dephasing processes , see  ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the latter processes are essential for projective readout and/or initialization but are detrimental to manipulations of the qubit state .",
    "alternative proposals to read out , manipulate , or initialize majorana box qubit states can be found in refs .",
    "for example , quantum dots may be applied as an alternative to leads for readout purposes .",
    "furthermore , by measuring products of pauli operators on different boxes , one may entangle the states of the corresponding qubits .",
    "in particular , a measurement - based protocol for generating a controlled - not gate can be found in ref .",
    "in this paper , we have outlined how majorana qubits can be defined and operated in a proximitized ti nanoribbon architecture .",
    "the key element of the construction are gate - tunable internal tunnel junctions realized through narrowed regions of lowered axial magnetic flux in ti nanoribbons .",
    "this allows us to tune the hybridization of mbss emerging from a topologically protected helical 1d surface state mode , and thereby makes it possible to manipulate the quantum information .",
    "the linear dispersion of the 1d modes in this platform is expected to give the mbss a high level of robustness .",
    "( in this regard , the situation may be better than in semiconductor wire platforms , where one is operating close to the bottom of a parabolic band . )",
    "we are confident that this platform is sufficiently versatile and flexible to implement the quantum information processing protocols outlined above .",
    "once proof - of - principle experiments have confirmed this expectation , one may envisage the extension of the system to 2d networks containing many majorana box qubits . specifically , the blueprint sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] indicates the extension to a network realizing a two - dimensional surface code , cf",
    ".  refs .",
    "the surface code approach builds on so - called stabilizer operators corresponding to products of eight majorana operators surrounding the minimal plaquettes of fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "there are two types ( a and b ) of such operators , and the essence of the surface code is that all of them commute .",
    "the binary eigenvalues @xmath160 of the stabilizers then define the physical qubits of the system . during each operational cycle of the system",
    "the majority of these qubits is measured ( ` stabilized ' ) , and projection onto the highly entangled degenerate ground states of the system takes place .",
    "the few qubits exempt from the measurement process serve as logical qubits and can be manipulated along the lines of the discussion above .",
    "in contrast to the ` unfolded ' linearly arranged box qubit in fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) , fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] suggests an alternative construction , where pairs of adjacent proximitized ti nanowires are connected through superconducting bridges to form 90-deg rotated ` h'-type structures .",
    "each of these structures represents a majorana box with its own charging energy .",
    "pairs of adjacent mbss on neighboring boxes are connected by tunnel links as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "since the ti nanoribbon network is most likely fabricated by lithographic and/or wet etching means , the present platform would naturally employ tunable ti nanoribbon parts for those tunnel links as well . in this way , the need for separate wires and/or other materials required by the corresponding semiconductor architecture @xcite might be avoided .",
    "since the proximitized ti nanoribbon parts in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] are arranged parallel to each other , the mbss can be generated simultaneously under a uniform applied magnetic field , provided the nanoribbon cross section can be accurately controlled in the fabrication process .",
