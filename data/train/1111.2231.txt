    "many - body effects within the partially filled @xmath5 shells of transition - metal oxides are at the heart of various intriguing phenomena . much of the interesting physics comes from the interplay between electron delocalization caused by intersite orbital overlap and strong coulomb interactions within the @xmath0 shell .",
    "the investigation of this interplay goes back as far as the 1930 s with the work of verwey , mott , and others.@xcite additional degrees of freedom arising from orbital degeneracy , electron - lattice couplings , and/or ligand @xmath6 to metal @xmath0 charge transfer effects increase in many cases the complexity of the problem .",
    "further , it was found that the multiorbital couplings within the @xmath5 shell may be strong even when the orbital degeneracy is lifted , e.g. , by the electrostatic field set up by neighboring ions .",
    "for the copper oxide superconductors , for example , it is believed that the off - diagonal coupling between states of @xmath7 and @xmath8 symmetry is one of the elements which determine the precise shape of the fermi surface , see , e.g. , and references therein .",
    "accurate estimates for the size of the @xmath0-level splittings are therefore important in designing realistic model hamiltonians for these systems .",
    "traditionally the @xmath0@xmath0 excitations in transition - metal oxides have been investigated by optical spectroscopy .",
    "first measurements on rocksalt compounds such as nio and coo were reported in the late 50 s .",
    "@xcite although in centro - symmetric cases these transitions are not dipole allowed , they do aquire weak intensity in the optical spectra due to the admixture of lattice vibrations which lift the inversion symmetry at the transition - metal site .    it has been shown recently that highly accurate measurements for both magnetic and local charge excitations can be carried out by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) . @xcite as demonstrated by moretti sala _",
    "@xcite for the case of @xmath0@xmath0 transitions in two - dimensional ( 2d ) cu oxide systems , the high energy resolution and the analysis of the polarization and scattering geometry dependence allow a quite reliable interpretation as concerns the nature of the final excited states .    the calculation of local excitations within the transition - metal @xmath5 shell is an interesting problem .",
    "it is desirable to use alternative approaches to standard density functional theory ( dft ) calculations because in first place electron correlations are strong and secondly , in its original formulation , dft is only a ground - state theory .",
    "the _ ab initio _ wavefunction - based quantum chemical approaches therefore constitute the method of choice here .",
    "advanced quantum chemical calculations have been recently applied to the study of @xmath0@xmath0 excitations in la@xmath1cuo@xmath3 , sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 , and cacuo@xmath1 .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "results@xcite turned out to be in good agreement with the rixs data reported by moretti sala _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the other hand , recent dft calculations on la@xmath1cuo@xmath3 predict @xmath9 to @xmath10 excitation energies that are 0.5 ev lower than in experiment.@xcite    here , we extend the study of 2d cuprates as in ref .   to the case of highly anisotropic chain and ladder cu @xmath11 compounds .",
    "the motivation for the present investigation is twofold .",
    "one one hand , we want to check the performance of our quantum chemical computational scheme@xcite in the case of one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi-1d cu @xmath11 systems .",
    "quantum chemical calculations on relatively small clusters have been earlier performed on both 2d and 1d cuprates , e.g. , the 2d layered materials la@xmath1cuo@xmath3 and sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 and the chain - like system sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2.@xcite however , differences as large as 0.5 ev were found between the on - site @xmath0@xmath0 excitation energies reported for la@xmath1cuo@xmath3 and sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 in ref .   and our more recent results discussed in ref .  .",
    "those differences seem to be related to the less precise description in ref .   of the adjacent @xmath5-metal and o ions ,",
    "i.e. , the nearest neighbor ( nn ) cu ions and ligands around the cuo@xmath3 plaquette at which the @xmath0@xmath0 excited states are explicitly computed .",
    "similar differences are here found for the @xmath0-level splittings of the chain system sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , which shows that a careful analysis of this issue is indeed motivated .",
    "secondly , our _ ab initio _",
    "data should be helpful for the correct interpretation of rixs and optical spectra in these compounds .",
    "for highly anisotropic structures , the degeneracy of both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels is lifted and the excitation spectra display a very rich structure . even in the 2d compounds ,",
    "the sequence of the different excited states can not always be predicted beforehand .",
    "for example , due to the different ratios between the in - plane and apical cu ",
    "o bond lengths , the @xmath8 hole state corresponds to the lowest crystal - field excited state in la@xmath1cuo@xmath3 , with a relative energy of 1.4 ev,@xcite and to the highest crystal - field excitation in hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath3 , with a relative energy of 2.1 ev.@xcite the situation should be even more complex in 1d systems . reliable _",
    "ab initio _ results are therefore desirable for the chain and ladder cuprates .",
    "our computational approach is based on correlated _ ab initio _ methods traditionally used in quantum chemical studies on molecular systems . for each of the materials investigated here , the starting point is a restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) calculation with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all rhf calculations were performed with the crystal program package.@xcite we applied gaussian - type atomic basis sets from the crystal library , i.e. , basis functions of triple - zeta quality@xcite for cu , o , and f and basis sets of either double - zeta or triple - zeta quality for metal ions next to the cuo@xmath1 chains ( e.g. , li , ca or v ) . in all computations",
    "experimental lattice parameters were used , as reported in refs .  .",
    "post hartree - fock correlation calculations can be carried out on finite embedded clusters , due to the local character of the correlation hole of a @xmath0 electron . yet , the orbitals used here are those of the infinite system .",
    "each embedded cluster @xmath14 consists of two distinct regions : an active region @xmath15 where the actual correlation treatment is performed and a buffer region @xmath16 whose role is to provide support for the longer - range tails of wannier orbitals ( wo s ) centered at sites in @xmath15 .",
    "the active region @xmath15 includes one reference cu site , the nn ligands , and the nn cu ions .",
    "for the systems addressed in this study , a given cu ion may have four , five or six nn ligands .",
    "those nn ligands thus form either l@xmath3 plaquettes , l@xmath17 pyramids or distorted l@xmath4 octahedra around a particular cu site . as concerns the @xmath16 region , we include in there each ligand coordination cage around the nn cu sites and all nn closed - shell metal ions . in cugeo@xmath2 ,",
    "for example , there are 8 ge@xmath18 nn s . in licu@xmath1o@xmath1 , there are 5 cu@xmath19 @xmath20 and 8 li@xmath19 nn s .",
    "all post - rhf computations were performed with the molpro quantum chemical software .",
    "@xcite    the orbital basis associated with a given cluster @xmath14 is a set of projected wo s : localized wo s associated with the rhf bands are first derived with the help of the orbital localization module of the crystal package and subsequently projected onto the set of gaussian basis functions associated with the atomic sites within the cluster @xmath14 .",
    "technicalities concerning this procedure are discussed in refs .  .",
    "for each particular cluster , the rhf data is additionally used to generate an one - electron embedding potential that models the crystalline environment .",
    "this effective potential is constructed with the matrop module of the molpro program by using a real - space matrix representation of the self - consistent fock operator from the periodic rhf calculation .",
    "@xcite all necessary rhf data is converted into molpro format with the help of an interface program.@xcite although the wo s at the atomic sites of @xmath14 are derived for each of the compounds discussed here by periodic rhf calculations for the cu @xmath21 electron configuration , the embedding potentials are obtained by replacing the cu@xmath22 @xmath21 ions by closed - shell zn@xmath22 @xmath20 species .",
    "this is a good approximation for the farther @xmath5-metal sites , as the comparison between our results and rixs data shows.@xcite the extension of this embedding scheme toward the construction of open - shell embeddings is an ongoing project in our group .",
    "while the occupied wo s in the buffer region @xmath16 are kept frozen , all valence orbitals centered at ligand and cu sites in @xmath15 are further reoptimized@xcite in multiconfiguration complete - active - space self - consistent - field ( casscf ) calculations.@xcite in the latter , the ground - state wavefunction and the crystal - field excited states at the central cu site are computed by state - averaged multiroot optimizations .",
    "@xcite the cu @xmath0-level splittings are finally obtained from additional multireference single and double configuration - interaction@xcite ( mrci ) calculations as the relative energies of the crystal - field excited states .",
    "the central cu @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath5 , nn ligand @xmath25 , and nn half - filled cu @xmath5 orbitals are correlated in mrci .    the virtual orbital space in the mrci calculation can not be presently restricted just to the @xmath15 region .",
    "it thus includes virtual orbitals in both @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which leads to very large mrci expansions . to make the computations feasible",
    ", we restrict our study to ferromagnetic ( fm ) allignment of the cu @xmath0 spins . even for fm clusters , the mrci expansion may include in some cases up to @xmath26 slater determinants .",
    "the 1d compounds sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 and srcuo@xmath27 , built of chains of corner - sharing cuo@xmath3 plaquettes , display a number of quite unusual properties . on one hand , these materials have the largest nn antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange integrals in the family of cu @xmath11 oxides . yet",
    ", the interchain couplings are very weak . @xcite they thus constitute ideal systems for studying the magnetic response of 1d spin-1/2 antiferromagnets .",
    "secondly , high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission experiments on these compounds have for the first time revealed the realization of spin - charge separation in 1d electron systems .",
    "@xcite     plaquettes in sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "the ground - state hole orbital is @xmath9 . ]",
    "we list in table [ dd_corner ] results for the @xmath0-level splittings of sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 and srcuo@xmath27 . as concerns",
    "the crystallographic details , a major difference between these two compounds is the presence of a network of single cuo@xmath1 chains in sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28,@xcite see fig .  1 , whereas srcuo@xmath27 displays a double - chain structure , with cuo@xmath3 plaquettes on adjacent chains sharing common edges .",
    "@xcite the clusters we use in our casscf and mrci calculations include therefore two nn plaquettes in the case of sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 and four adjacent plaquettes for srcuo@xmath27 .",
    "the reference system is chosen such that the @xmath29-axis is along the cuo@xmath1 chains and @xmath30 is perpendicular onto the cuo@xmath3 plaquettes . in this framework ,",
    "the ground - state hole orbital has @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "the data in table [ dd_corner ] show that the @xmath0-level splittings in sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 and srcuo@xmath27 are very similar . in both cases , the relative energy of each particular excited",
    "state is not very different from the corresponding value in the li@xmath27cuo@xmath27 compound , see sec .",
    "iii.c . as in sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 and srcuo@xmath27 , there are no apical ligands in li@xmath27cuo@xmath27 either",
    ". results for the @xmath0-level electronic structure of the latter compound are listed in table [ dd_edge ] .",
    "inclusion of single and double excitations on top of the casscf wavefunctions brings a nearly uniform upward shift of 0.1 to 0.2 ev for the @xmath0@xmath0 transitions . by adding davidson",
    "corrections,@xcite the relative energies of the excited states further increase by 0.05 to 0.1 ev . the mrci values listed in table [ dd_edge ] include such davidson correction terms .",
    "this relative stabilization of the electronic ground state with respect to the higher lying states in mrci is mainly related to ligand @xmath25 to metal @xmath5 charge - transfer correlation effects which are more important for the in - plane @xmath9 hole orbital having @xmath32-type overlap with the nn o @xmath25 functions .    .",
    "casscf / mrci @xmath0@xmath0 excitation energies for corner - sharing chains of cuo@xmath3 plaquettes in sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 and srcuo@xmath27 ( ev ) .",
    "the mrci values include davidson corrections.@xcite [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ dd_ladder ]    the quantum chemical calculations were carried out on a cluster whose active region @xmath15 is defined by one reference cuo@xmath3 plaquette and the five adjacent cu ions ( one cu nn on the same rung , two leg nn s , and two cu nn s on an adjacent ladder ) .",
    "the buffer region @xmath16 includes the two apical o ions of the reference cu site , the nearest four ligands for each adjacent cu ion , and six ca neighbors .",
    "the apical o ligands are at rather large distance from the central cu site , 3.0  .@xcite    casscf and mrci results for the cu @xmath0-level splittings in cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 are listed in table  [ dd_ladder ] . the mrci treatment and the davidson corrections bring shifts of 0.2 to 0.3 ev to the casscf @xmath0@xmath0 excitation energies .",
    "the excitation energies to the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath8 orbitals are somewhat smaller than in sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 , srcuo@xmath27 , and li@xmath1cuo@xmath27 because in the latter compounds there are no apical ligands . at the same time",
    ", the splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is larger than in the other cuprates investigated here , see fig .  4 , because the apical cu ",
    "o bond length is the largest in cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it has been shown here that wavefunction - based electronic - structure calculations are well - suited for computing local charge excitations as observed in transition - metal oxides by optical and rixs measurements . while this was demonstrated previously for a number of layered cuprates,@xcite we have extended here those applications to 1d and ladder compounds .",
    "results and trends for the @xmath0@xmath0 excitations in low - dimensional cuprates are summarized in fig .",
    "the _ ab initio _ data compare well with the results of optical absorption measurements on kcuf@xmath2@xcite and somewhat underestimate the excitation energies found by rixs experiments for cuo.@xcite future rixs experiments on other 1d cuprates included in fig .",
    "4 will constitute a direct test for the symmetry and energy of the different @xmath0@xmath0 excitations that we predict here .    from a more general perspective",
    ", the results reported here clearly indicate the significant potential of the _ ab initio _ wavefunction - based methods in the context of correlated electronic materials and the need to further develop such techniques in parallel with approaches based on density functional theory . the latter has revolutionized the field of electronic - structure calculations but its limits are also clear .",
    "computations of excited states of strongly correlated electrons are in a way the worst case for dft .",
    "one is then forced to avail oneself to alternatives , i.e. , wavefunction - based methods .",
    "an attractive feature is that strong correlations can be handled by casscf calculations even when we deal with infinite periodic systems . in all approximations which are being made ,",
    "the accuracy of the wavefunction - based methods can be progressively increased .",
    "here we supplemented the casscf calculations by mrci , yet , alternative supplementary methods are possible .",
