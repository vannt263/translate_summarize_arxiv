    "spin effects in fragmentation processes play an important role in understanding the spin physics in strong interaction . with the developments in experiments ,",
    "much attention has been attracted to the studies of the different aspects in this connection ( see , e.g. ref.[1-[ma01pp ] ] and references therein ) .",
    "data are now available from different lepton - induced reaction experiments [ 1-[e665 ] ] and many of the theoretical studies [ [ jaf]-[xbj ] ] also concentrate on those reactions . it should be emphasized that the spin effects in the fragmentation processes can also be studied in polarized hadron - hadron collisions by measuring the properties of the hadrons in high transverse momentum @xmath0 jets created in these reactions [ [ florian98]-[ma01pp ] ] . here , because of the validity of factorization theorem , the hadrons can be regarded as the pure results from the fragmentation of the scattered quark whose polarization can be determined using perturbation theory in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the quark distribution functions which determine the polarization before the hard scattering .    compared with those in the lepton - induced reactions , the study of hadrons in high @xmath0 jets in polarized hadron - hadron collisions has the following properties .",
    "( 1 ) since the involved hard scatterings are strongly interacting processes rather than the electroweak processes involved in the lepton - induced reactions , the corresponding cross section should in general be larger .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity of the incoming proton beams can in general be made higher than that for leptons in particular much higher than that for neutrino .",
    "hence , the statistics can be improved in particular compared with the lepton - induced reactions with neutrino beams .",
    "( 2 ) there are many different hard subprocesses which contribute to the production of the high @xmath0 jets . in particular , we have a large contribution from gluon interactions .",
    "this , on the one hand , makes the study more complicated than those in lepton - induced reactions , on the other , makes it more interesting since we can use it to study not only quark but also gluon polarization and fragmentation which are even poorly studied yet .",
    "hence , it is also very important to know whether there exist kinematic regions where gluon fragmentation is important or where quark fragmentation dominates . in this case , we can study them separately .    in this paper",
    ", we first make an analysis of the contributions of the different hard subprocesses to the production of different hyperons in different kinematic regions in @xmath1 collisions using a monte carlo event generator .",
    "our results show that , there do exist kinematic regions where contributions from quark fragmentation dominate , while in the other gluon fragmentation plays an important role .",
    "we then calculate the longitudinal polarization of the hyperons in the regions where quark fragmentation dominates using the same method as we used in studying quark fragmentation in the lepton - induced reactions . in section 2",
    ", we present the results for the monte carlo analysis of the contributions of different hard processes . in section 3 , we briefly summarize the calculations and the main results for the polarizations of the scattered partons from different hard subprocesses . in section 4",
    ", we present the results for the polarizations of different hyperons from high @xmath0 jets .",
    "a brief summary of the results is given in section 5 .",
    "we consider the inclusive production of hyperons with high transverse momentum @xmath0 in @xmath1 collisions at high energy . here",
    ", the factorization theorem can be applied , hence the cross section can be written as@xcite , @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the unpolarized distribution functions of partons @xmath7 and @xmath8 in proton at the scale @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the corresponding momentum fractions carried by @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; @xmath12 is the fragmentation function of parton @xmath13 into hadron @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the momentum fraction of parton @xmath13 carried by the produced @xmath14 ; @xmath16 is the cross section at the parton level and @xmath17 is the usual mandelstam variable of the parton scattering .",
    "the cross section of the hard subprocess can be calculated using perturbative qcd .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) runs over all possible subprocesses . to the leading order in pqcd ,",
    "there are following subprocesses that contribute here , i.e. the scattering between quark(s ) and/or antiquark(s ) , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; the scattering between gluons or that between gluon and quark , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; the annihilation processes , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the scattering matrix elements for these subprocesses can easily be calculated and the results can e.g. be found in ref . [ [ qcd ] ] . for scattering angles less than @xmath26 in the center of mass frame of the scattering partons , the cross section for @xmath27 is the largest , and @xmath28 is the second largest one .",
    "they are much higher than the @xmath29 or @xmath30 scattering in particular at the scattering near @xmath26 .",
    "since the energies of gluons in protons are in general smaller compared with those for the quarks and/or antiquarks , we expect that @xmath31 scattering plays an important role for jets with moderately large transverse momenta @xmath0 .",
    "but , for very high @xmath0 , @xmath29 scattering should dominate .",
    "taking the fragmentation into account , we can estimate the contribution from each subprocess to the production of different hyperons .",
    "presently , this can be conveniently done using monte carlo event generators which can give a good fit to the unpolarized data .",
    "we used pythia@xcite in our calculations and obtained the results for @xmath2 and @xmath3 as a function of pseudorapidity @xmath32 in figs.[jlam ] and [ jsig ] . from these figures , we explicitly see that , at high @xmath0 , e.g. , @xmath0@xmath338 gev at @xmath34=200 gev or @xmath0@xmath3313 gev at @xmath34=500 gev , only a few subprocesses dominate . the contributions of quark scatterings @xmath35 ( which denotes all the subprocesses in which the initial and final partons are all quarks ) and @xmath21 are important whereas that from @xmath23 is suppressed significantly .",
    "we also calculated the contributions from quark jets or gluon jets .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[qgjet ] and [ qgjetsig ] .",
    "we see that the contribution from gluon fragmentation is negligibly small in this kinematic region , especially in the large rapidity region ( e.g. @xmath32@xmath331.5 ) .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of the calculations of hyperon polarizations in such kinematic regions caused by the unawareness of the polarized gluon fragmentation function should be very small .",
    "in our calculations which will be presented in section 4 , we will just neglect this contribution .",
    "however , at lower @xmath0 , the contribution from @xmath27 or that from gluon fragmentation is very important . as an example",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ smpt ] the corresponding results for @xmath0@xmath333 gev at @xmath34=500 gev .",
    "we see that the contribution of gluon fragmentation is higher than that of quark in the central rapidity regions .",
    "hence , we can study the spin transfer in quark fragmentation in the high @xmath0 region and that in gluon fragmentation in relatively small @xmath0 region .",
    "since we are considering only the elementary subprocess with high @xmath0 , the scattering matrix elements can be calculated to high precision using pqcd . the spin transfer factor for each subprocess",
    "can be obtained from the helicity amplitudes .",
    "the results show that , for all the different kinds of processes @xmath36 ( here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath37 denote different partons , where @xmath7 denotes the one from the longitudinally polarized incoming proton ) , the longitudinal polarization can be transferred to the outgoing parton @xmath13 and @xmath37 .",
    "the polarization transfer factors are in general different for different scattering processes .",
    "but they have a common feature that they are only functions of a single variable @xmath38 , which is defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the four - momenta of the partons @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "we summarize these results in table 1 .    from the table",
    ", we see the following : ( i ) since we neglect quark mass , helicity conservation is valid .",
    "this can be seen from the results that @xmath44 , and that @xmath45 .",
    "( ii ) in the scattering processes @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the polarization transfer from one of the colliding objects to the other is the same , and they are also the same as that in the qed process @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the result is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath38 , which increases from zero to one as @xmath38 goes zero to one . to get a feeling of all these spin transfer factors ,",
    "we show them as functions of @xmath38 in fig .",
    ".    multiplied by the polarizations of the incoming quarks or gluons , which are determined by the helicity distribution functions of the partons in proton , we obtain the polarizations of the outgoing quarks or gluons .",
    "they can be used to calculate the hyperon polarization produced in the fragmentation of these partons . clearly , the obtained results depend on the polarized parton distribution functions we use",
    ". we will also show how strongly the final hyperon polarizations depend on the different sets of parameterization @xcite of these distributions .",
    "as we have seen in sec .",
    "2 , for hyperons with considerably high transverse momenta , quark fragmentation dominates whereas gluon fragmentation can be neglected . in such kinematic regions , we can calculate the hyperon polarization using the same method as we used in treating @xmath51 in lepton - induced reactions",
    ". measurements of the hyperon polarizations in these kinematic regions can be used as further tests of the different pictures for spin transfer in high energy quark fragmentation processes .",
    "the experimental studies can also be made in other kinematic regions where gluon fragmentation plays an important role . by comparing the obtained results with those obtained in the regions where quark fragmentation dominates",
    ", we can get useful information for gluon fragmentation . in this section",
    ", we present the calculations and the main results in the kinematic regions where quark fragmentation dominates .",
    "the method of calculating the longitudinal polarization @xmath52 of different hyperon @xmath53 in the fragmentation of a longitudinally polarized quark @xmath54 was outlined in ref .",
    "[ [ ll2000 ] ] using the inclusive process @xmath55 as an example .",
    "it has been applied to @xmath56 annihilations@xcite and deeply inelastic scattering using different lepton beams@xcite .",
    "we now summarize the main points in the following not only for completeness but also for the following reasons : here , we would like to emphasize what kinds of inputs that we need in the calculations and how we obtain these inputs . in this way , we can see from where the theoretical uncertainties originate in the calculations and how we should reduce these uncertainties by doing measurements for different hyperons and/or in different kinematic regions .",
    "we consider @xmath57 and divide the produced @xmath53 s into the following groups : ( a ) directly produced and contain the @xmath54 s ; ( b ) decay products of heavier hyperons which were polarized before their decays ; ( c ) directly produced but do not contain the @xmath54 s ; ( d ) decay products of heavier hyperons which were unpolarized before their decays .",
    "obviously , hyperons from ( a ) and ( b ) can be polarized while those from ( c ) and ( d ) are not .",
    "hence , the polarization of @xmath53 is given by , @xmath58 the different quantities here are defined and obtained in the following way :    \\(i ) @xmath59 is the polarization of @xmath54 which is determined by the initial conditions and the elementary hard scattering processes .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath60 is the average number of @xmath53 s which are directly produced and contain @xmath54 of flavor @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is that from the decay of @xmath63 s which were polarized ; @xmath64 is the polarization of @xmath63 ; @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the average numbers of @xmath53 s in group ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "these average numbers of the hyperons of different origins are determined by the hadronization mechanisms and should be independent of the polarization of the initial quarks . hence , we can calculate them using a hadronization model which give a good description of the unpolarized data .",
    "we used lund model@xcite implemented by jetset or lepto or pythia@xcite in our calculations for different reactions .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath69 is the probability for the polarization of @xmath54 to be transferred to @xmath53 in group ( a ) , i.e. to the @xmath53 which contains @xmath54 , and is called the polarization transfer factor , where the superscript @xmath70 stands for fragmentation",
    ". it is taken as the fraction of spin carried by the @xmath61-flavor - quark divided by the average number of valence - quark of flavor @xmath61 in @xmath53 .",
    "this is the place where different pictures come in , since the contributions to the hyperon spin from different flavors are different in the su(6 ) or the dis picture@xcite . in the su(6 ) picture , these contributions can be obtained from the su(6 ) wave functions of the hyperons . in the dis picture , for the @xmath71 octet hyperons",
    ", they are obtained from the dis data on the spin dependent structure functions and those on hyperon decay .",
    "but , for the decuplet hyperons , they are unknown yet . in our calculations , we make a rough estimations of these contributions by taking them as the same as those in the su(6 ) picture",
    ". it will be interesting and important to study theoretically which picture is applicable in determing @xmath69 .",
    "discussions along this line can be found , for example , in [ [ ada97 ] ] and the references given there .",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath72 is the probability for the polarization of @xmath63 to be transferred to @xmath53 in the decay process @xmath73 and is called decay polarization transfer factor , where the superscript @xmath74 stands for decay .",
    "it is determined by the decay process and is independent of the process in which @xmath63 is produced . for the octet hyperon decays ,",
    "they are extracted from the materials in review of particle properties@xcite .",
    "but , for the decuplet hyperons , we have to use an estimation based on the su(6 ) quark model .",
    "( the details are given in e.g [ [ gh93],[ll2000 ] ] ) .",
    "hence , we see that decuplet hyperon decay is a major source of the theoretical uncertainties in our calculations of the final @xmath52 s in different reactions . for them , in the dis picture , neither @xmath69 nor @xmath72 is known yet . to reduce this uncertainty ,",
    "it is important to consider the hyperons to which decay contributions are small .",
    "we note also that @xmath69 and @xmath72 should be considered as universal in the sense that they are the same in different reactions .",
    "the differences between different processes come from the polarization @xmath75 of the fragmenting quark @xmath76 and the average numbers @xmath60 , @xmath62 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for hyperons @xmath53 from the different origins . in @xmath1 collisions that we are considering in this paper ,",
    "@xmath59 is determined by the polarization of the partons before the hard scattering and spin transfer factors in the scattering which are given and discussed in last section .    the average numbers @xmath60 , @xmath62 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are determined by the hadronization mechanism and the relative abundance of different flavors that take part in the reactions .",
    "they should be independent of the process in which @xmath54 is produced and they are also independent of the polarization of @xmath54 . in @xmath1 collisions , as we can see from eq.([sigma ] ) , these average numbers are determined by three factors , i.e. , the parton distribution functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the cross sections of hard subprocesses @xmath77 , and the fragmentation functions @xmath12 .",
    "the cross section @xmath77 can be calculated with high accuracy from pqcd . for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath12 , although neither of them is theoretically clear yet , the form of the unpolarized parton densities in nucleon and that of the unpolarized fragmentation functions are empirically known to reasonably high accuracy .",
    "we can calculate them using the parameterizations of the structure functions and the phenomenological hadronization models . since we are not concerned with the different correlations among the produced particles , different hadronization models lead essentially to the same results .",
    "presently , these results can be obtained conveniently from the event generators using monte carlo method .",
    "we use the lund string fragmentation model@xcite implemented by pythia@xcite in our calculations for @xmath1 collisions .",
    "most of the studies now available on the spin transfer concentrate on @xmath2 polarization since @xmath2 is most abundantly produced among all the @xmath71 hyperons and it s polarization can be measured easily through the decay channel @xmath79 . meanwhile , as we have seen already in @xmath56 annihilation @xcite and deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering @xcite , the origins of @xmath2 are also the most complicated",
    ". they can be not only directly produced from the fragmentation of @xmath80 , @xmath37 , or @xmath81 quark , but also from the decays of many different heavier hyperons , such as , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . in the large @xmath0 regions in @xmath1 collisions , the fragmentations of the quarks from the subprocesses @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath18 dominate .",
    "in particular for hyperons with large rapidities , the scatterings of quarks with large fractional momenta play the most important roles .",
    "since at large @xmath86 in proton , @xmath80 quark density is much higher than that of @xmath37 , and both of them are much higher than that of @xmath81 , we expect that @xmath80 and @xmath37 , particularly @xmath80 , quark fragmentation dominates the @xmath2 production in the high @xmath0 and large rapidity region .",
    "however , @xmath80 or @xmath37 quark carries no spin of @xmath2 in the su(6 ) picture and only a small fraction of the spin of @xmath2 in the dis picture , we expect that , just as in deeply inelastic scattering @xcite , the magnitudes of the @xmath87 obtained in both models should be quite small , much smaller than those obtained in @xmath56 annihilation near the @xmath88 pole",
    ". the influence of heavier hyperon decay should be very important and the induced theoretical uncertainties in the calculations should be relatively large .",
    "using the event generator pythia , we obtained the average numbers @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 for @xmath2 production in @xmath78 . by inserting them into eq .",
    "( [ polh ] ) , we obtain @xmath93 as a function of the pseudorapidity @xmath32 .",
    "we show the different contributions to @xmath2 production at @xmath34 = 500 gev and @xmath0@xmath3313 gev as functions of @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ lamorg ] and @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ lampol ] .",
    "the moving direction of polarized beam proton is taken as the rapidity axis . from these results , we see in particular the following characteristics .    first , from fig.[lamorg ] , we see that the contributions from @xmath80-quark fragmentation indeed dominate the @xmath2 s , in particular at large @xmath32",
    ". there are several direct consequences following from this : ( i ) the contributions from heavier hyperon decays are large , even larger than the directly produced contributions . to show this point more clearly , we present as an example in fig .",
    "9 the different contributions to @xmath93 in the su(6 ) picture .",
    "we see that the magnitudes of the contributions to @xmath93 from @xmath82 and @xmath94 decays are both much larger than those from directly produced @xmath2 s .",
    "we see that even the qualitative tendency are influenced very much by these decay contributions .",
    "( ii ) the resulting @xmath95 is relatively small , it is less than 3% .",
    "( iii ) the differences between the results from su(6 ) and those from the dis picture are small .",
    "second , the contributions from those hyperons which are directly produced and contain the fragmenting @xmath54 s [ origin ( a ) mentioned in section 4.a ] or from the decays of the heavier hyperons which are directly produced and contain the fragmenting @xmath54 s [ the type of heavier hyperons of origin ( a ) ] are much larger than the corresponding contributions in the lepton - induced reactions .",
    "this is very interesting since these hyperons are all polarized and the polarizations are proportional to that of @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , in the limiting case that there are only these two types of hyperons contribute , we have , @xmath96 here , we use the superscript @xmath97 in @xmath98 to denote the polarization of hyperon @xmath63 of only origin ( a ) .",
    "it is clear that , from eq.([polh ] ) , for such heavier hyperons , @xmath99 by inserting it into eq.([polhlim ] ) , we obtain that , @xmath100p_f^{(q ) }   \\over { \\langle n^a_{h_i}\\rangle + \\sum\\limits_{j } \\langle n^a_{h_j}\\rangle r_{h_i , h_j } } } } , \\label{polhlim2}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 denotes the branching ratio for the decay @xmath73 .",
    "we see clearly that , in this limiting case , the @xmath52 reflects more directly the polarization of the fragmenting quark @xmath54 .",
    "it is proportional to the @xmath59 s and the proportional constants depend on the picture for spin transfer and also the decay polarization transfer factors involved .",
    "we see clearly that @xmath93 should depends rather strongly on @xmath59 , which is determined by the spin transfer factors given in table 1 and the polarized parton distribution functions . to see how sensitive it is",
    ", we used two different sets of parameterizations in the calculations .",
    "we see that the resulting difference in @xmath93 is indeed quite significant .      from the results that we obtained in the last subsection",
    ", we see that the contributions from the decay of heavier hyperons to @xmath2 are large and the @xmath2 polarization is very small .",
    "since the contributions of different flavors to the spins of the @xmath102 hyperons are unknown yet in the dis picture and only models are known to calculate the spin transfer in their decay processes , there are considerably large theoretical uncertainties in the results that we can obtain yet . on the other hand , as we have already seen@xcite in @xmath56@xmath103@xmath88@xmath103@xmath104 and in @xmath105 , the origins of other @xmath71 hyperons , i.e. , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , are rather simple .",
    "the decay contributions are much smaller than the corresponding contributions for @xmath2 production .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in this case can be significantly reduced . in particular in the large rapidity region",
    ", the @xmath80 quark fragmentation plays the dominant role and @xmath80 carried most of the hyperon @xmath108 s spin .",
    "hence , the resulting @xmath3 polarization in @xmath109 should be much larger than that for @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , also because of the dominance of the @xmath80 quark fragmentation , the production rate of @xmath3 should be comparable with that of @xmath2 , which implies that the statistics for studying @xmath3 should be similar to that of @xmath2 .    using the event generator pythia",
    ", we calculate the different contributions to the inclusive @xmath3 production in @xmath1 collisions . using eq.([polh ] ) , we obtain @xmath110 as a function of @xmath32 at @xmath0@xmath3313 gev .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ sigorg ] and [ hypol4 ] ( a ) . here",
    ", we see that the decay contribution from heavier hyperons is very small .",
    "it takes only a few percents for @xmath0@xmath111 gev at @xmath112=500 gev .",
    "we see also that the obtained @xmath110 is much larger than @xmath93 and the difference between those results based on the two different pictures are much more significant , in particular for large @xmath32 . from these calculations",
    ", we also see again that the contributions from the directly produced @xmath3 s which contain the fragmenting quark play the dominate role .",
    "in fact , they give more than 75% of the whole produced @xmath3 at @xmath0@xmath33@xmath113 gev .",
    "in particular for @xmath32@xmath33@xmath114 , those directly produced and contain the fragmenting @xmath80-quarks take more than 93% .",
    "if we neglect all other contributions , we obtain the @xmath110 in this limiting case , i.e. the @xmath110 for those only from the origin ( a ) as , @xmath115 we see that it is directly proportional to the polarization of the @xmath80-quark , @xmath116 , after the hard scattering and the proportional constant is just the fragmentation spin transfer @xmath117 .",
    "this provides indeed an excellent place to test different pictures for spin transfer in fragmentation processes .",
    "it may provide also a nice tool to study the polarization of the quarks .",
    "further studies along this line are under way@xcite . from fig.11 , we see also that the results for @xmath110 from two different sets of parameterizations of the helicity parton distributions are rather small .",
    "this is because @xmath110 depends mainly on @xmath118 , which is essentially the same in the two sets of parameterizations .",
    "we also make similar calculations for other hyperons , i.e. , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ hypol4 ] ( b)-(d ) .",
    "we see that , @xmath122 exhibits similar behavior as @xmath123 but has opposite sign .",
    "this is because , similar to @xmath3 where @xmath80-quark fragmentation dominates , @xmath37-quark fragmentation dominates @xmath119 production . but @xmath124 has opposite sign as @xmath118 in proton .",
    "both @xmath125 and @xmath126 are determined mainly by the fragmentation of @xmath81-quark but with some influence from @xmath80 or @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath80 or @xmath37 contributes negatively to the spin of @xmath107 , and @xmath118 is positive in proton but @xmath124 is negative , we should have a negative of @xmath80 quark fragmentation to @xmath125 but a positive contribution from @xmath37 to @xmath126 .",
    "this makes @xmath125 and @xmath126 behave a bit different .",
    "the difference can be seen in fig.11 .",
    "all these different features can be used to make further tests to the su(6 ) or dis picture used for the spin transfer in fragmentation processes .",
    "in summary , after a monte carlo analysis of the different contributions , we calculated the longitudinal polarizations for different hyperons in high @xmath0 jets in @xmath1 collisions with longitudinally polarized beams using two different pictures : the su(6 ) and the dis pictures .",
    "the results show that the @xmath2 polarization is rather small and has large contributions of different heavier hyperons decay . on the contrary ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath3 production or that to @xmath119 production is rather pure and the polarization is much larger .",
    "hence , the measurements of these polarizations can give a good test to the validity of the two pictures .",
    "such measurements can e.g. be carried out at rhic in the near future .",
