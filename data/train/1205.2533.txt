    "to what extent are galaxies ( or some subset of galaxies ) homologous in the sense that all individual objects are scaled copies of one another ?",
    "the discovery of the fundamental plane ( fp ) @xcite of elliptical galaxies distinctly sharpened this question because galaxies showed a regularity that almost , but not quite , followed that expected from the virial theorem for systems in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the virial theorem holds regardless of whether galaxies are homologous , but if each galaxy were unique , then the fp would have a large scatter .",
    "if all galaxies were simply scaled copies of one another , then the fp would follow the virial expectation . in either of these cases ,",
    "the fp would likely not have generated the interest that it has because it would either be less useful ( in the former case ) or less interesting ( in the latter case ) .",
    "actual galaxies seem to be in between these two possibilities : they are quite regular in structure , but do not quite follow the simple virial expectation .",
    "an understanding of the origin of the fp requires at least one ingredient aside from the virial theorem , and the search for that missing ingredient has been the focus of a great number of observational and theoretical studies .",
    "homology means that all galaxies are somehow scaled copies of one another .",
    "obviously the property of homology applies only to a set of objects , not to individual galaxies .",
    "if galaxies were made up of only one type of matter , then there is no ambiguity in the definition of homology .",
    "however , they are in fact made up of dark matter , luminous matter , and gas , the behaviour of each component is dominated by different physics , and the components are only weakly coupled . for such systems , the proper definition of homology is not clear .",
    "several informal definitions seem to be in common use ; for single component systems , all of these definitions are equivalent .",
    "not so for multi - component galaxies .",
    "we formalize the definitions currently in use and discuss which definitions are stronger or weaker in the sense that the galaxies that fit one definition are or are not a subset of those that fit another definition .",
    "then we apply these ideas to galaxy remnants produced in numerical simulations .",
    "finally , we discuss how these ideas may be applied to observed galaxies .",
    "it is obviously the case that homology can only apply to some subset of galaxies ( ellipticals and spirals are quite distinct ) .",
    "it has also been established that even for restricted sets of galaxies , homology can only be approximate because , for example , the shape of the surface brightness as a function of radius ( parametrized by the srsic parameter @xmath0 ) correlates with galaxy luminosity @xcite . however , elliptical galaxies are still quite _ close _ to being homologous ",
    "close enough that the concept is still very useful .    in section [ sec : theory ]",
    "we show that homology is closely related to the choice of units for each galaxy : homologous galaxies are all the same up to a choice of units , where the units are allowed to change from one galaxy to the next . for multi - component galaxies",
    ", there is an ambiguity in the definition of homology that we may be able to exploit : perhaps the baryonic half - light radius is not the right choice to make all galaxies look the same . in section [ sec : previous - work ] we review recent observational and theoretical work on the subject of galaxy structure and homology . in section [ sec : simulations ] we use numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to show that there is indeed a better choice of dimensional scaling constants , at least for the set of simulations under consideration .",
    "unfortunately our preferred choice of scaling constants are not directly observationally accessible , so in section [ sec : observations ] we work out the relationship between our preferred definition of the scaling constants and the conventional choices for plausible baryonic and dark matter distributions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "when discussing single - component models , it is fairly clear how to make the definition of homology precise .",
    "such a galaxy is fully described by its distribution function @xmath1 giving the density of stars with the given position @xmath2 and velocity @xmath3 .",
    "a set of galaxies is homologous if there exists a ` master ' distribution function @xmath4 where the distribution function of a specific galaxy @xmath5 is obtainable from @xmath4 via : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are arbitrary scale constants , different for each galaxy .",
    "if one knows the universal distribution function , three numbers suffice to completely describe a galaxy .",
    "this will be called _ scaling homology_.    scaling homology is closely related to systems of units .",
    "it means that all galaxies are the same if one works with the correct system of units , where the units are allowed to change from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "it is very important to recognize at this point that these scaling constants are _ not _ necessarily equal to the half - mass radius , the velocity dispersion , and the total galaxy mass . for single component galaxies , these choices for the scaling constants",
    "are essentially the only reasonable ones : if galaxies are homologous , then other choices will end up being simple functions of the half - mass radius , etc .",
    "however , for multi - component galaxies , our job is to take a set of galaxies and _ infer _ the definitions for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 that make all of their distribution functions derivable from a single ` master ' distribution function .",
    "if no such definition exists , then the galaxies are not scaling - homologous .",
    "section [ sec : simulations ] is devoted to carrying out this analysis for a set of simulated galaxy merger remnants .",
    "perhaps the most common method of defining homology is to define structure constants relating the true values of a galaxy s mass and luminosity to ` virial estimates ' obtained using scaling constants . from @xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the galaxy s luminosity , @xmath9 is the mass , @xmath13  is the projected half - light radius , @xmath14  is the mean surface brightness inside @xmath13 , @xmath15 is the projected aperture velocity dispersion , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are structure constants defined by these two equations .",
    "the important point is that @xmath9 is the true mass of the galaxy while @xmath15 and @xmath13  are scale factors combined in such a way as to dimensionally produce a mass ( up to physical constants )",
    ". therefore variation of @xmath17 from galaxy to galaxy indicates that mass profiles of the two galaxies differ to produce a different relationship between the virial estimator and the actual mass .",
    "a set of galaxies is said to be homologous if these structure constants are the same for all galaxies .",
    "we denote this definition _ structure - constant homology_.    it is easy to show that for single - component systems , structure - constant homology and scaling homology are equivalent .",
    "putting the two definitions into the same language , we have : @xmath18 the total kinetic energy is @xmath19 and the total potential energy is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the scalar virial theorem is then : @xmath22 let us define three arbitrary scaling constants @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , and dimensionless coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 . @xmath25",
    "using the definition of the dimensionless distribution function in equation [ eq : nondim - df ] , the virial theorem becomes : @xmath26 therefore we define the structure constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 with these definitions , the virial theorem is simply : @xmath29 and comparing to equation [ eq - structure - constant ] reveals that : @xmath30 where @xmath31  refers to the total baryonic mass of the galaxy .      describing a galaxy that contains both stellar and dark matter requires specifying two distribution functions , f and g , with corresponding dimensionless functions f and g.    why do we use separate distribution functions for baryonic matter and dark matter , but we do not separate the different components of baryonic matter into young stars , old stars , disc stars , etc ?",
    "the different stellar components have different formation histories and the moments of the distribution function that appear in the jeans equations will be different for the different stellar components . here",
    "we attempt to strike balance between accuracy and simplicity : our description of the system should be complex enough to be accurate , but simple enough to be informative .",
    "hence we separate baryonic matter from dark matter because the two types of matter obey different physics and have _ very _ different histories . by including all baryonic matter in a single distribution function , we sacrifice some accuracy in order to make the description simple enough to be easily understood and manipulated .    allowing for a second component",
    ", the virial theorem takes the form : @xmath32 we define @xmath33 so that at last we have the virial theorem in the form : @xmath34    from these expressions it is clear that for multi - component galaxies :    * scaling homology implies structure - constant homology .",
    "* structure - constant homology does not imply scaling - homology because structure - constant homology only requires a small number of constraints on the definite integrals defining @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . * a set of galaxies being structure - constant homologous does not imply that each component is separately structure - constant homologous .",
    "structure - constant - homologous galaxies can be built from non - homologous components if the change in @xmath38 compensates for the change in @xmath39 and similarly for @xmath36 . * the components of galaxies being structure - constant - homologous",
    "does not imply that the galaxies are structure - constant - homologous .",
    "* the structure constants for multi - component galaxies are not simply the sum of the structure constants of the individual components owing to the cross term @xmath37 .    finally , similar considerations for scaling - homology yield :    * scaling - homology of galaxies implies scaling - homology of the components .",
    "* scaling - homology of the components does not imply scaling - homology of galaxies .",
    "if a set of galaxies is composed of scaling - homologous components , then the set of multi - component galaxies will be scaling - homologous only if the ratios of the scaling constants for each component are the same for all of the galaxies in the set .",
    "that is , @xmath40 must be the same for all of the galaxies .",
    "one may wonder whether the dark and luminous components should be allowed their own scaling constants .",
    "this idea is problematic because scaling the components separately disturbs the dynamical equilibrium of the galaxy .",
    "consider a galaxy in dynamical equilibrium where the baryonic scale radius is allowed to shrink to zero , making the baryons into a point mass .",
    "the dark matter far outside the original baryonic scale radius will not be significantly affected by this operation .",
    "however , the dark matter near the centre ( inside the original baryonic scale radius ) will have more mass enclosed after the change .",
    "the new galaxy will obviously be out of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we have seen from the above considerations that scaling homology is a stronger concept that structure - constant homology in the sense that scaling homology implies structure - constant homology , but not vice versa . for two - component galaxies",
    ", the two components can undergo compensating changes to leave the structure constants unchanged .",
    "this does not seem to be a desirable property for a concept like homology .",
    "finally , there is a certain theoretical elegance to the viewing homology as closely connected to the choice of the system of units ",
    "a set of galaxies is scaling homologous if all of the galaxies are the same when using the correct system of units .",
    "for all of these reasons we advocate that homology be taken to mean scaling homology .",
    "structure - constant homology should be clearly denoted as a different concept .",
    "there are three independent ways to generate the tilt in the fundamental plane .",
    "any or all of them may be at work .",
    "the first is a systematic change in the stellar mass - to - light ratio with the mass of the host galaxy via trends in the age , metallicity , or initial mass function of the stellar population . in this case",
    "the stellar and dark matter distribution functions are scaling ( and therefore structure - constant ) homologous because the masses of stars and dark matter components are unaffected .",
    "the second is a systematic change in the dark matter fraction near the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this is a mild form of non - homology which is achieved by changing the ratio of the mass scaling constants @xmath41 with galaxy mass , where @xmath42  is the total dark matter mass of the galaxy .",
    "overall scaling- and structure - constant homology are violated , but the baryonic components by themselves may be nearly scaling- and structure - constant - homologous . furthermore",
    ", as long as the stellar and dark matter remain nearly decoupled due to their very different half mass radii , then changing the dark matter fraction should not greatly disturb the dynamical equilibrium of the stellar material . in this case",
    "the stellar population mass - to - light ratio is identical for all galaxies , but the total mass - to - light ( both for the entire galaxy and within any radius ) ratio changes systematically with mass .",
    "the third possibility is that homology is flagrantly violated and the baryonic components of galaxies are neither scaling nor structure - constant homologous .",
    "even if the stellar population mass - to - light ratio is always the same , there is still total freedom in the total mass - to - light ratio owing to the total freedom in the choice of dark matter profile for each galaxy . it may change or be constant as a function of radius , and the total mass - to - light ratio may change or be constant for the entire set of galaxies .",
    "a great source of confusion is that the first and second possibilities are very different theoretically but rather similar observationally .",
    "everyone agrees that the first possibility involves homology and the third possibility involves non - homology .",
    "however , the second possibility is _ observationally _ very similar to the first possibility but _ theoretically _ very similar to the third possibility .",
    "this unfortunate circumstance makes it difficult to come to firm conclusions .",
    "there are two contributions to a total mass - to - light ratio : one from the characteristics of the stellar population and one due to the accompanying dark matter . if the mass - to - light ratio changes with galaxy mass because of a changing stellar population , then the fp will be tilted but the mass distribution may still be homologous .",
    "however , if the mass - to - light ratio changes due to changing dark matter fraction , then the galaxies _ must _ be non - homologous .    consider the spherically symmetric jeans equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number density of tracer particles , @xmath45 is the radial component of the velocity dispersion , @xmath46 is the total gravitational potential , @xmath47 is the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath48 is the tangential component of the velocity dispersion .",
    "the matter density is provided by two components , @xmath49  and @xmath50  for baryons and dark matter .",
    "the poisson equation is linear so the solutions obey the superposition principle . putting this into the jeans equation results in :",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52  and @xmath53  refer to the potential due to the baryonic and dark matter respectively and the constant @xmath54 parametrizes the dark matter fraction . if a galaxy is in equilibrium for any value of @xmath54 , then",
    "_ any _ change to @xmath54 _ must _ be compensated by a change in the anisotropy @xmath55 or a change in the radial fall - off of density or velocity dispersion .",
    "variations in the dark matter fraction and non - homology are the same concept . if the tilt in the fp is _ not _ due to systematic changes in the stellar population mass - to - light ratio , then it _ must _ be due to non - homology .",
    "there is no separate case where ` only ' the dark matter fraction and therefore the observed mass - to - light ratios are changing .",
    "given the somewhat confused use of the word homology in the present literature , it is perhaps easier to focus on what _ non - homology _ means . as discussed above , one way galaxies could be non - homologous is by having baryonic profiles that change shape from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the fact that not all galaxies have the same srsic index already tells us that the population of galaxies can not be perfectly homologous .",
    "if the dark and luminous components scale separately from each other so that different galaxies have different amounts of dark matter within some radius , then the galaxies must also be considered non - homologous .    finally , recall that since structure - constant homology only places a few constraints on the definite integrals defining @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , the luminous and dark components of a set of galaxies can undergo compensating changes so that the galaxies _ would _ be deemed structure - constant homologous , but would _ not _ be scaling homologous .",
    "we use this observation to argue that scaling homology is the more useful concept and the concept of structure - constant homology should be avoided .",
    "armed with a precise definition of the different flavors of homology we highlight a few recent observational and theoretical results .",
    "we wish to give a brief overview of the state of the field , but unfortunately none of these studies will be directly relevant to the present one because they all use the half - light radius as the relevant length scale . in section [ sec : simulations ] we will show that for a large set of hydrodynamic simulations , we obtain more instructive results by using @xmath56 , the radius where the enclosed dark matter and luminous matter are equal .",
    "simulated merger remnants look significantly more homologous when using @xmath56 than when using @xmath57 .",
    "thus far we have been concerned only with theoretical galaxies : all quantities of interest can be measured to arbitrary precision .",
    "however , the only observationally accessible quantities are projected ones .",
    "the measured mean surface brightness within the effective radius involves an integral along the light of sight and therefore implicitly mixes information about the entire mass / light profile at all radii .",
    "furthermore , both dark matter and stellar populations contribute to the measured mass - to - light ratios of galaxies .",
    "variations of mass - to - light ratios due to one or the other of these possibilities are very different theoretically , but observationally similar",
    ".    one may ask if we could take the results of an observational or theoretical study discussed below , take a guess at the scaling of the density profile between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and then directly compare the results of previous studies to our own . unfortunately , carrying out such a project would tell us something about our assumed scaling between @xmath57 and @xmath56 , but it would not tell whether other authors would reach different conclusions if they use @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 . in order to answer the latter question , we need access to the full density profiles as a function of radius in the case of numerical studies .",
    "we unfortunately must wait for other groups to analyse their simulations in terms of @xmath56 in order to see if our findings hold true beyond our present set of simulations .",
    "there has been some success in recent years indicating that stellar population models have progressed to the point where it is possible to measure stellar mass - to - light ratios from spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the usual assumption is that the initial mass function is universal , but recent observations have cast doubt on that idea @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in spite of the many codes available to estimate stellar masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many are based on a rather small number of libraries of stellar spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus one may be concerned about covariance between the different estimates of stellar mass because their fundamental assumptions are similar .",
    "if this is the case , then agreement between the different estimates indicates that their assumptions are similar , not that the stellar masses have actually been accurately measured .",
    "@xcite used @xcite modeling of sauron @xcite early - type galaxies to show that the so - called virial mass estimator ( @xmath58 ) is an excellent estimator of the dynamical mass within one effective radius .",
    "the sauron survey also has stellar spectra over the whole galaxy image out to approximately one effective radius , and is thus excellently placed to use stellar population synthesis to finally break the degeneracy between dark matter fraction and stellar population mass - to - light ratio .",
    "their figure 17 unfortunately does not permit a single firm conclusion . for dynamical mass - to - light ratios below 2.8",
    ", there is a linear relationship between the stellar mass - to - light ratio and the dynamical mass - to - light ratio , indicating that the dark matter fraction does not change . for larger mass - to - light ratios ,",
    "there is essentially a single stellar mass - to - light ratio , independent of the dynamical mass - to - light ratio , indicating that either the initial mass function or the the dark matter fraction _ does _ change .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used strong gravitational lenses to argue that if one replaces the luminosity surface density in the fp with the mass surface density , one gets an untilted fundamental mass plane that is in full agreement with the virial expectation .",
    "therefore the tilt in the fp must be due to variations in mass - to - light ratio .",
    "however , there is little guidance from strong gravitational lensing about whether the total mass - to - light variation is due to changing dark matter fractions , changing stellar populations , or a changing initial mass function .",
    "@xcite used sdss data to compare stellar mass and dynamical mass estimates for a set of galaxies .",
    "they found that the two were related , but non - linearly , and that the non - linearity could be removed by defining a ` structure - corrected ' dynamical mass that takes the srsic parameter @xmath0 of the galactic light into account .",
    "thus they conclude that elliptical galaxies are not homologous .",
    "@xcite made the conventional choice of scaling different galaxies by their half - light radii and central velocity dispersion in order to evaluate the question of whether or not they are homologous .",
    "@xcite study stacked sdss spectra of early - type galaxies as a function of their position in the fundamental plane .",
    "they found that the variation in the dynamical mass - to - light ratios was too large to be explained by variations in the stellar mass - to - light ratios alone .",
    "this indicates varying dark matter fractions and is interpreted as non - homology in the galaxy population .",
    "@xcite used multi - band hubble space telescope images to construct stellar masses from stellar population models for 73 massive early - type galaxies identified as strong gravitational lenses as part of the slacs survey @xcite . combining this information with velocity dispersions from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , they concluded that the central dark matter fractions of massive early - type galaxies increase systematically with galaxy mass if one assumes a universal initial mass function .",
    "they found that the stellar mass - to - light ratio was essentially constant with galaxy mass .",
    "@xcite carried out dynamical modeling of a subset of these galaxies using ground - based integral - field - unit data and reached the same conclusion .",
    "@xcite analyzed sdss velocity dispersions along with stellar masses obtained from the jhu / mpa value - added galaxy catalog .",
    "dynamical considerations led them to conclude that the ratio of dynamical mass to dark mass was constant and they argued that the tilt of the fp is entirely due to stellar population effects .",
    "@xcite used @xcite models of 13 bright galaxies in the coma cluster constructed by @xcite along with stellar masses from sdss to reach the same conclusion .",
    "after many years of effort , it seems that stellar population modeling and dynamical modeling have progressed to the point where it is possible to separate the effects of changing dark matter fractions from that of changing stellar populations .",
    "however , recent studies have concluded both that galaxies are homologous and that they are not homologous .",
    "in addition , most applications of stellar population modeling require the assumption of a universal initial mass function .",
    "however , work by @xcite and @xcite have cast doubt on this long - held assumption .",
    "if the initial mass function is truly not universal , both dynamical modeling and stellar population modeling will be more difficult .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied dissipationless merger simulations to determine whether mergers leave the fp intact .",
    "@xcite started with structure - constant homologous systems and found that their remnants did not share the property .",
    "the merger remnants _ do _ lie on the fp , evidently because the two structure constants are able to undergo compensating changes since they only appear in a multiplicative combination in the fp relation ( their equation 6 ) .",
    "@xcite studied a smaller number of much higher resolution simulations and found that both structure - constant homology and the fp were preserved by the merger process at the 10% level .",
    "they did , however , find a significant violation of homology for radial - orbit mergers .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulations to study dissipation as the potential origin of the fp tilt .",
    "they assumed that all observable galaxy properties are power - law functions of the mass of the galaxy and the gas fraction , and then used several merger simulations with different gas fractions and masses in order to fix the power - law exponents and constants in their model .",
    "they were left with a set of constraints on the power - law exponents such that for any observed fp tilt , one could solve for the properties of the progenitor galaxies ( e.g. , gas fraction ) as a function of mass .",
    "this of course depends on their merger simulations being good representatives of all mergers of that mass and gas fraction .",
    "@xcite used a large number of dissipational simulations of galaxy mergers , assumed a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio and concluded that with a sufficient amount of gaseous dissipation , merger remnants naturally produce a tilted fp . since they assumed a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio , this tilt must have been caused by structural non - homology / varying dark matter fraction .",
    "@xcite performed an extensive study of dissipation and the origin of the fundamental plane .",
    "they seem to be concerned with structure - constant homology , but dismiss non - homology as the source of the fp tilt .",
    "they assert that gas dissipation causes a varying dark - matter fraction inside the effective radius , which in turn tilts the fp .",
    "as stated above , we note that a varying dark - matter fraction is not distinct from non - homology .",
    "however , it can perhaps be considered to be a weak form of non - homology where only one of many possible degrees of freedom is exercised .",
    "it is conceivable that any or all of these studies would reach a different conclusion if they were to use our definition of length , velocity , and mass scales rather than the usual observationally motivated definitions . in order to make this determination , we need more information than is available in the published papers , so we must wait for other groups to try analyzing their simulations and observations in terms of @xmath56 rather than @xmath57 .",
    "we hasten to add that we are _ not _ claiming that any previous authors have made any mistake .",
    "other researchers have correctly formulated and answered questions about the scaling relations of galaxies . given the assumption that the relevant length scale was the baryonic half - mass radius , these studies generally found measurable non - homology in the galaxy population that manifested itself by a changing central dark matter fraction .",
    "we are pointing out that the choice of @xmath57 as the relevant length scale is arbitrary , and other choices may be more instructive in understanding galaxies and galaxy merger remnants . on the bases of our simulations",
    ", we have found that scaling the simulations by @xmath56 gives very instructive results .",
    "we hope that other researchers will find this terminology similarly useful .",
    "as already noted , the dimensional scaling constants used in the definition of scaling - homology are _ not _ required to be the conventional choices of half - mass radius , central velocity dispersion , etc . in this section we consider a set of simulated galaxy merger remnants and search for a definition of the dimensional scaling constants so that the dimensionless properties of the set of remnants are as similar as possible .",
    "once one has arrived at a definition for the scaling constants that seems to work well , one must compute the value for a given galaxy .",
    "therefore we are restricting ourselves to simple , physically - motivated definitions of the dimensional scaling constants , such as the baryonic half - mass radius , the total half - mass radius , the radius where the enclosed baryonic and dark masses are equal , etc .",
    "one could imagine carrying out a high - dimensional minimization where the function to be minimized is the sum of the total deviations of the scaled density and velocity profiles from the mean scaled profiles for all galaxies .",
    "the free parameters in the minimization are the three scaling constants for each galaxy .",
    "this would effectively tell you whether or not there _ exists _ a definition of the scaling constants that makes the galaxies scaling - homologous .",
    "however , it would _ not _ give a simple way to compute the dimensional scaling constants for a _ given _ galaxy .",
    "one would _ know _ the value of the scaling constants for a galaxy in the ` training ' set : the fitting procedure would provide it . but one would not be able to compute the dimensional constant for a _ new _ galaxy , not in the training set .",
    "using numerical simulations allows us to quickly explore many possible definitions of the scaling constants with little uncertainty in , for example , the total galaxy mass or velocity dispersion .",
    "the simulated galaxies are of course imperfect stand - ins for actual galaxies , but our hope is that working with simulated galaxies will allow us to eliminate many of the definitions that are possible and focus on one ( or a few ) that seem to work well .",
    "only the most successful choices when compared to simulations will be considered including the additional complications inherent to observational data .",
    "there are two sets of simulations of binary mergers considered here .",
    "the @xmath59  series consists of equal mass mergers between two identical gas - rich progenitors on a variety of orbits .",
    "the @xmath60  series consists of mergers of galaxies with lower gas fractions and a wide range mass ratios using only a few different orbits .",
    "@xcite contains a full description of the simulations .",
    "we considered eight possible radius scales including stellar , dark , and total 3d effective radii and projected effective radii , the radius where stellar mass density and dark mass density are equal , and finally the radius where the enclosed stellar mass and enclosed dark mass are equal .",
    "we evaluated thirty mass scales including the stellar , dark , and total mass , the total of each type of mass within each of four radii ( stellar effective radius , dark effective radius , radius where stellar and dark densities are equal , and the radius where the enclosed stellar and dark masses are equal ) , and the mass scale that sets each of the three types of mass density to one at each of the four radii .",
    "the last dimensional choice is either a velocity or a time , and we tried the central 3d velocity dispersion , the projected velocity dispersion , and dynamical times at each of the above listed radii .",
    "evaluating one ` model ' requires a choice of one of each of the three dimensional constants : length , mass , and velocity / time .",
    "this leads to a very large number of combinations .",
    "fortunately , only a few choices work better than the conventional observationally motivated choices of baryonic half - mass radius , central velocity dispersion , and total baryonic mass . in this paper",
    "we plot only the conventional choices and the best alternate definition we found : the length scale is @xmath61 , the radius such that the enclosed dark and baryonic matter are equal , @xmath62 , the mass enclosed within @xmath61 , and @xmath63 , the dynamical time at @xmath61 . for the dynamical time",
    ", we use @xmath64 so that @xmath65    to evaluate each choice of the scale constants , we plot dimensionless density and velocity dispersion profiles for all galaxies : @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the magnitude of the radius vector .",
    "for simplicity we use spherical apertures to convert the 3d density and velocity profiles of the simulated galaxies into the 1d profiles shown here . using ellipsoidal profiles instead does not change our conclusions .",
    "the velocity dispersion and rotation information is given in spherical coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath70 is the azimuthal angle and the coordinate system is defined by the shape of the stellar remnant so that the @xmath71 axis corresponds to the short axis of the remnant .",
    "if the simulated galaxies are perfectly scaling - homologous and we have hit upon the correct definition of the dimensional scaling constants , then the dimensionless density and velocity dispersion profiles will be exactly the same for all galaxies .",
    "non - scaling - homologous galaxies will lead to large variations in the profiles from galaxy to galaxy .",

    "a particularly useful formulation of the concept is termed _ scaling - homology_. using this definition , homology means that all galaxies are the same when scaled using the correct choice of length , mass , and time units , where the units are allowed to change from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the three dimensional constants serve to fully specify a galaxy once the ` master ' distribution function that describes all galaxies is known .",
    "we used a set of hydrodynamical binary galaxy merger simulations spanning a range of masses , mass ratios , orbits , gas fractions , and supernova feedback prescriptions ( but no agn feedback ) to determine the definition of dimensional scaling constants that served to make the remnants as close as possible to homologous .",
    "we found that the best definition of length , mass , and time units are @xmath56 , the radius within which dark and baryonic masses are equal , the mass within @xmath56 , and the dynamical time measured at @xmath56 .",

    "the stellar anisotropy is essentially the sole source of the variation in the kinematic structure of these simulated merger remnants .",

    "we emphasize that it is not _",
    "incorrect _ to phrase questions about homology in terms of @xmath57 .",
    "previous theoretical and observational studies that have done so have correctly asked and answered well - posed questions about galaxy scaling relations .",
    "however , we find that it is more informative to phrase questions about homology in terms of @xmath56 rather than @xmath57 , at least for our set of numerical simulations .",
    "using @xmath57 , we would have concluded that our merger remnants are not homologous owing to a systematic change in the dark matter fraction within @xmath57 .",
    "however , if we instead scale by @xmath56 , we find that the merger remnants appear significantly more uniform .",
    "they are not perfectly homologous , but they are closer to homology than we would conclude based on @xmath57 .",
    "we are eager to learn whether the same holds true for numerical simulations by other groups and whether it holds true for actual galaxies .    in order to facilitate the use of these scaling constants to analyse actual galaxies , we calculated the ratios @xmath78 and @xmath79 for a set of observationally plausible two - component galaxy models and provided fitting formulas for the results .",
    "the fact that @xmath61  plays such a prominent role in these scaling constants immediately recalls the disc - halo conspiracy arising from the study of spiral galaxy rotation curves @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that such a conspiracy will arise naturally if the dissipational collapse of baryons is limited by their initial angular momentum and if the baryon fraction is roughly equal to the spin parameter @xmath80 .",
    "the result presented here appears to be another manifestation of this phenomenon .",
    "if the baryons have very little angular momentum , they will contract to the point where they are completely self - gravitating and the dark matter does not play a role in the dynamics , in which case @xmath13  and not @xmath61  is the important radius . on the other hand , if the baryons have too much angular momentum , they will not contract enough and the more massive dark matter halo will dominate the dynamics while the baryons function more as a tracer population .",
    "simulated galaxy merger remnants are nearly homologous when @xmath61  rather than @xmath13  is used as the dimensional scaling constant , indicating that galaxies are in a ` goldilocks ' state where both baryons and dark matter play important dynamical roles .",
    "this is likely because of the initial balance between the baryon fraction and the spin parameter of dark matter haloes .",
