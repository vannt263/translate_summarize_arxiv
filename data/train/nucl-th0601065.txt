    "one of the most important and challenging problems in both theoretical and experimental nuclear physics is to understand the properties of matter under extreme conditions of density and pressure .",
    "the determination of the eos ( namely , the relationship between pressure and density ) associated with such matter is a non - trivial problem which has attracted significant effort over the last few decades .",
    "concerning terrestrial systems , detailed knowledge of the eos is important , for instance , for understanding heavy - ion collision dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "the eos is crucial for determining the properties of one of the most exotic objects in the universe  neutron stars .",
    "neutron star properties depend on the knowledge of the eos over a wide range of densities  from the density of iron at the stellar surface up to several times the density of normal nuclear matter in the core region of the star @xcite .",
    "neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist .",
    "like all stars neutron stars rotate  some at a rate of a few hundred revolutions per second",
    ". such a fast rotating object will experience enormous centrifugal force which must be balanced by another force , gravity in this case , to prevent the star from falling apart .",
    "the balance of the two forces sets the lower limit on the stellar density @xcite .",
    "some neutron stars are in binary orbit with a companion and , in some cases , the application of orbital dynamics allows for an assessment of the masses .",
    "so far six neutron star binaries are known and all of them have masses in the range @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , observations of ns masses and radii impose important constraints on the eos of dense matter , as the latter constitutes the basic input quantity that enters the structure equations of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "although considerable progress has been made , the eos of dense matter remains uncertain at densities above @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for the reason stated above , this places uncertainty on the calculated ns properties . determining the high density",
    "stellar matter eos is a tremendous task . while at densities @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 is the normal nuclear density ) , matter consists mainly of nucleons and leptons , at higher densities several other species of particles are expected to appear due to the rapid rise of the baryon chemical potentials with density . among these are strange baryons , such as the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 hyperons . in addition",
    ", pion - nucleon resonances may appear in stellar matter along with pion and kaon condensations .",
    "moreover , at super high densities nuclear matter is expected to undergo a transition to quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the value of the transition density may be obtained from qcd lattice calculations at finite baryon densities , but is presently still uncertain .",
    "after the first theoretical calculations of neutron star properties performed by oppenheimer and volkoff and independently by tolman @xcite , many theoretical predictions appeared in literature .",
    "non - relativistic and relativistic approaches have been used .",
    "a number of early theoretical investigations on ns properties were done within the non - relativistic skyrme framework .",
    "the reader is referred to the work of f. douchin and p. haensel in ref .  .",
    "the conventional brueckner theory with a continuous choice for the single particle potential and three - body forces was applied in ref .  .",
    "numerous predictions allow for hyperons together with nucleons and leptons in generalized @xmath0-equilibrium to be included in the stellar interior .",
    "the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) scheme was extended to include these contributions and applied in ns calculations .",
    "since the walecka model @xcite was proposed and applied to nuclear matter properties , the relativistic mean field approach has been widely used in determining ns total masses and radii @xcite .",
    "the dbhf approach was used to compute ns properties in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in general ,",
    "the eos of stellar matter is considerably model dependent and , as a result , predictions of ns properties are quite different from model to model . among the sources of model dependence are @xcite : ( 1 ) the many - body framework used for the determination of the eos , ( 2 ) the model used for the bare nn interaction , ( 3 ) the kinds of hadrons / leptons included in the description of electrically neutral ns matter , ( 4 ) the treatment of pion and kaon condensations , ( 5 ) including the effects of fast rotation , ( 6 ) allowing for a phase transition from confined hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter . the possibility of such transition has attracted great interest over the last 30 years @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed upon that the high pressure found in the core of a neutron star creates an ideal physical environment for hadrons to transform into quark matter  a state of matter of practically infinite lifetime . nevertheless , until recently no empirical evidence had been reported . to a certain extent",
    ", this may signify that the occurrence ( or not ) of a transition to quark matter in the ns interior has only a minor impact on the overall static properties ( range of possible masses , radii , limiting rotational periods ) of the star @xcite .",
    "the situation , however , could be completely different for the timing structure of a pulsar ( its braking behavior as it evolves ) which is expected to diverge significantly from the normal pulsar behavior if the star converts a fraction of its core matter to pure quark matter @xcite .",
    "recently we have been concerned with probing the behavior of the isospin - asymmetric eos . in our work on neutron skins",
    ", we have studied applications of the eos at densities typical for normal nuclei . in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed the one - body potentials for protons and neutrons from dbhf calculations of neutron rich matter ( in particular their dependence upon the degree of asymmetry in proton and neutron concentrations ) .",
    "more recently , we applied our microscopic approach in calculations of effective in - medium nn cross sections @xcite .",
    "it is also important and timely to look into systems which are likely to constrain the behavior of the eos at higher densities , where the largest model dependence is observed .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present paper , where we report predictions for masses and radii of static ( non - rotating ) neutron stars . aside from minor adjustments ,",
    "the framework is the one described in ref .  .",
    "we apply a relativistic ( dbhf - based ) eos and perform our calculations for two distinct cases : ( 1 ) pure neutron matter , and ( 2 ) baryon / lepton matter in @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "it is also our objective to provide an overview of the present status of both theory and experimental constraints .",
    "together with systematic calculations based on our microscopic model , this broad outlook will help us gauge the quality of our tools and determine the importance of potentially missing mechanisms .",
    "this work is organized in the following way : after the introductory notes in this section , we briefly review our theoretical framework ( section 2 ) ; the relativistic ( dbhf - based ) eos for both neutron matter and @xmath0-stable matter is discussed in section 3 ; our numerical results are presented and discussed in section 4 ; we conclude in section 5 with a short summary and suggestions for further studies .",
    "in order to provide the reader with a self - contained manuscript , in this section we outline briefly the formalism used to derive the isospin - asymmetric eos . a more extensive discussion can be found in ref .   and references therein .",
    "the starting point of any microscopic calculation of nuclear structure or reactions is a realistic free - space nn interaction .",
    "a realistic and quantitative model for the nuclear force that has a reasonable basis in theory is the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model @xcite . in this framework bosons with masses below the nucleon mass",
    "are typically included .",
    "the model we apply in the present study consists of six bosons four of which are of major importance : ( 1 ) the pseudoscalar pion with a mass of about 138 mev .",
    "it is the lightest meson and provides the long - range part of the nn potential and most of the tensor force ; ( 2 ) the @xmath8 vector meson  a @xmath9 p - wave resonance with a mass of about 770 mev and spin 1 .",
    "its major role is to cut down the pion tensor force at short range ; ( 3 ) the @xmath10 vector meson  a @xmath11 resonance of about 783 mev and spin 1 .",
    "it creates a strong repulsive central force of short range and the short - ranged spin - orbit force ; ( 4 ) the isoscalar - scalar @xmath12 boson with a mass of about 550 mev .",
    "it provides the intermediate range attraction necessary for nuclear binding and can be understood as a simulation of the correlated s - wave @xmath9-exchange .",
    "the mesons are coupled to the nucleon through the following meson - nucleon lagrangians for the pseudoscalar ( ps ) , scalar ( s ) , and vector ( @xmath13 ) fields , respectively :    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    with @xmath17 the nucleon and @xmath18 the meson fields respectively ( notation and conventions as in ref .  ) . for isovector ( isospin 1 ) mesons ( such as @xmath8 and @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is to be replaced by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the usual pauli matrices .    from the above",
    "lagrangians the obe amplitudes can be derived ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "the obe potential is defined as the sum of the obe amplitudes of all exchanged mesons .    in this work ,",
    "we use the bonn a , b , and c parameterizations of the obe potential formulated in the framework of the thompson equation .",
    "the main difference between these three potentials is in the strength of the tensor force as reflected in the predicted d - state probability of the deuteron , @xmath23 .",
    "bonn a has the weakest tensor force with @xmath24 ( see table 2 in ref .  ) .",
    "the bonn b and c potentials predict 5.1% and 5.5% , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the strength of the tensor force is a crucial factor in determining the location of the nuclear matter saturation point on the coester band @xcite .",
    "we review here the main steps leading to the self - consistent calculation of the energy per particle in infinite nuclear matter , with or without isospin asymmetry , within the bhf approach .",
    "this is mainly to provide a baseline for the next subsection where we describe its relativistic extension ( which is the method we actually apply ) . for a complete description of the bhf method the reader",
    "is referred to refs .  .",
    "for a review , see , for example , ref .",

    "nuclear matter is characterized by its total density or fermi momentum @xmath25 ( and the degree of isospin asymmetry , in case of unequal proton and neutron densities ) . with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the momenta of two nucleons with respect to nuclear matter",
    ", it is customary to formulate the problem in terms of their relative momentum , @xmath28 , and one - half of the center - of - mass momentum , @xmath29 .",
    "( clearly , @xmath30 . )    the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction in nuclear matter is described in terms of the reaction matrix , or the brueckner @xmath31-matrix , which satisfies the in - medium scattering equation ( the bethe - goldstone equation )    @xmath32    where @xmath33=@xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , and the asterisk signifies that medium effects are applied to these quantities .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the initial , final , and the intermediate momenta , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 is the two body obe potential briefly discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "@xmath41 is the energy of the two - nucleon system , and @xmath42 is the starting energy .",
    "thus , @xmath43 with @xmath44 the total energy of a single nucleon in nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath31-matrix equation ( eq .  ( 4 ) ) is density dependent due to the presence of the pauli projection operator , q , which prevents scattering into occupied states and is defined as @xmath45 detailed expressions for the ( angle - averaged ) pauli operator can be found , for instance , in ref .   for the case of unequal proton and neutron fermi momenta",
    ".    equation ( 4 ) is density dependent also through the single - particle energy , @xmath46 with @xmath47 the kinetic energy and @xmath48 the potential energy due to the interaction of the nucleon with all the others in the medium .",
    "we define @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 and @xmath51 single particle momentum , spin , and isospin states .",
    "schematically , eq .  ( 8) has the form @xmath52 @xmath53 for neutrons and protons , respectively . together with the @xmath31-matrix equation , eqs .",
    "( 9 - 10 ) constitute a coupled , self - consistency problem , which is solved using the `` effective mass approximation '' .    to demonstrate the self - consistency procedure , we take the non - relativistic single - particle energy and set @xmath54 which amounts to parametrizing the potential @xmath48 in terms of the nucleon effective mass @xmath55 and the constant @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "equation ( 11 ) implies @xmath58 hence in the non - relativistic case the single - particle potential , @xmath48 , has been fitted with a quadratic function of @xmath59 .",
    "( the subscript `` @xmath60 '' signifies that the parameters are different for neutrons and protons . ) starting with some initial values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the @xmath31-matrix equation is solved and a first solution for @xmath48 is obtained .",
    "these solutions are then parameterized in terms of a new set of constants , and the procedure is repeated until convergence is reached ( that is , until differences between the parameters from successive iterations are within the desired accuracy ) .",
    "once the single - particle potential is available , we calculate the ( average ) energy per particle ( to lowest order in the @xmath31-matrix )",
    ".    as is well known , nuclear matter calculations based on the bhf approach fail to predict correctly the saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the typical trend is that the saturation density is too high for reasonable energies .",
    "different calculations based on the conventional bhf approach differ somewhat in their predictions of nuclear matter saturation properties , but all of them fail to predict simultaneously the correct saturation energy and density  @xcite . for this reason , it has become popular to implement non - relativistic calculations with contributions from phenomenological three - body forces .",
    "on the other hand , already more than two decades ago it was realized that the explicit treatment of the lower component of the dirac spinor in the medium could provide the missing saturation mechanism .",
    "this observation started what became known as the dbhf approach .",
    "we review some of the main points in the next section .      for a detailed description see , for example ,",
    "the essential point of the dbhf approach is to use the dirac equation for the single particle motion in nuclear matter @xmath61 where the most general lorentz structure for @xmath48 is approximated as @xmath62 here @xmath63 is an attractive scalar field and @xmath64 is the timelike component of a repulsive vector field .",
    "the fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 are in the order of several hundred mev and strongly density dependent @xcite . with the definitions @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the dirac equation in nuclear matter",
    "can be written as @xmath67 the positive energy solution of eq .",
    "( 15 ) is given by @xmath68 with @xmath69 a pauli spinor , and @xmath70 .",
    "we notice that this is formally identical to the free - space spinor , but with @xmath71 replaced by @xmath55 .",
    "the single particle potential is then calculated from the operator given in eq .",
    "( 14 ) and properly normalized dirac spinors .",
    "namely , @xmath72 the quantities @xmath63 and @xmath73 are momentum dependent , but to a good approximation can be taken as constant .",
    "hence , for the single particle potential , one can write @xmath74 which , as in eq .  ( 12 ) , again amounts to parameterizing the single particle potential in terms of two constant quantities ( for each type of nucleon ) . in analogy with the usual hartree - fock definition of the single particle potential ( see eq .  ( 8) ) , we also write @xmath75\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 satisfies the relativistic scattering equation    @xmath77    using the definitions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , eq .",
    "( 20 ) can be rewritten as @xmath80    which is formally identical to the non - relativistic @xmath31-matrix equation ( eq .  ( 4 ) ) .",
    "we are then in a situation that is technically equivalent to the non - relativistic case , except for the dirac structure of the single - particle energy .",
    "namely , eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 21 ) ( where the potential @xmath81 is written in terms of in - medium spinors , eq .  ( 16 ) ) , must be solved self - consistently for @xmath82 and the single particle potential , @xmath48 , with the help of the chosen parametrization , eq .  ( 18 ) .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the energy per particle .    in summary ,",
    "the most significant difference between the bhf and dbhf schemes is that in the latter case the nucleon wave function is obtained self - consistently , while in the bhf approach the free - space solution is used .",
    "this difference turns out to be an important one  as a result of the reduced nucleon mass in the medium , the lower component of the nucleon spinor is larger than in free space .",
    "this is well known to produce a density - dependent , repulsive - many body effect , with the result that the predicted saturation density and energy are consistent with the empirical values . physically , the description of the nucleon in nuclear matter with a dirac spinor as in eq .",
    "( 16 ) can be regarded as effectively taking into account some many - body force contributions @xcite ( hence , the reduced need for inclusion of three - body forces in the relativistic scheme ) .      in the present section",
    "we discuss the structure equations of static ( non - rotating ) neutron stars .",
    "these are objects of highly compressed matter so that the geometry of spacetime is changed considerably from that of flat space .",
    "thus models of such stars need to be constructed within the framework of general relativity combined with theories of superdense matter .",
    "the connection between these two branches of physics is provided by einstein s field equations @xmath83 which couple the einstein curvature tensor , @xmath84 , to the energy - momentum density tensor , @xmath85 , of stellar matter .",
    "the tensor @xmath85 contains the equation of state in the form @xmath86 ( pressure , @xmath87 , as a function of the energy density , @xmath88 ) , and @xmath31 is the gravitational constant .",
    "einstein s field equations are completely general and simple in appearance .",
    "however they are exceedingly complicated to solve because of their non - linear character and because spacetime and matter act upon each other .",
    "there are only a few cases in which solutions can be found in closed form .",
    "one of the most important closed - form solutions is the schwarzschild metric outside a spherical star .",
    "another is the kerr metric outside a rotating black hole .",
    "starting from einstein s field equations one can derive the structure equations of a static , spherically symmetric , relativistic star .",
    "for an explicit treatment and derivation see for example the work of fridolin weber in ref .",
    "these equations are generally known as tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations .",
    "in a system of units where @xmath89 , the tov equations can be written as @xmath90\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left[1+\\frac{4\\pi{r^3}p(r)}{m(r)}\\right ] \\left[1-\\frac{2m(r)}{r}\\right]^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath91 to proceed to the solution of these equations , it is necessary to provide the eos of stellar matter in the form @xmath86 .",
    "starting from some central energy density @xmath92 at the center of the star @xmath93 , and with the initial condition @xmath94 , the above equations can be integrated outward until the pressure vanishes , signifying that the stellar edge is reached .",
    "some care should be taken at @xmath95 since , as seen above , the tov equations are singular there .",
    "the point @xmath96 where the pressure vanishes defines the the radius of the star and @xmath97 its gravitational mass .",
    "for a given eos , there is a unique relationship between the stellar mass and the central density @xmath98 .",
    "thus , for a particular eos , there is a unique sequence of stars parameterized by the central density ( or equivalently the central pressure @xmath99 ) .    in this work",
    "we apply a standard fifth order runge - kutta numerical scheme @xcite to integrate the tov equations , which are supplemented by the eos in numerical form . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the features of the eos applied in this study .",
    "we apply here the relativistic equation of state . for a detailed discussion of the isospin - dependent eos",
    "we refer the reader to ref .  . in the present study",
    "we calculate neutron star properties considering either pure neutron matter or asymmetric matter in @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "the degree of isospin asymmetry is represented by the asymmetry parameter , @xmath100 with @xmath101 the neutron / proton densities and @xmath102 the total density .",
    "( clearly , @xmath103 for symmetric nuclear matter and @xmath104 for pure neutron matter . ) the isopsin - dependent eos can be written as @xmath105 with @xmath106 the average energy per neutron / proton and @xmath107 the energy per particle as a function of the total fermi momentum and the asymmetry parameter .",
    "the total fermi momentum , @xmath25 , is related to the total density , @xmath8 , in the usual way @xmath108    we start with showing the isospin - dependent eos for neutron and symmetric matter , see fig .  1 .",
    "in both cases , predictions are shown for dbhf and bhf calculations and all three nn potentials referred to in subsection 2.1 .",
    "for the case of pure neutron matter ( upper frame of fig .  1 ) , we see essentially no differences among the predictions from the three potentials .",
    "as already discussed , a main source of differences among the three versions of the bonn potential is in the strength of the tensor force , which is mostly reflected in the ( @xmath109 ) @xmath110 coupled states . in neutron matter ( @xmath111 ) , however , this partial wave does not contribute and thus the model dependence is dramatically reduced @xcite .",
    "consistent with these observations , in symmetric matter significant differences are observed among the three potentials , see lower panel of fig .  1 .",
    "notice that our eoss are considerably more attractive than those shown in ref .",

    "dotted ( dark blue ) , and dashed ( light blue ) curves correspond to bonn a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "no differences can be seen among the predictions from the three potentials in the case of neutron matter . ]    for solving the tov equations one needs to compute energy density and pressure , both of which are simply related to the eos . as previously outlined , in our self - consistent calculation of the eos we fit the single - particle potential with its `` effective mass approximation '' .",
    "although chosen on reasonable theoretical grounds , the _ ansatz _ we use has a finite domain of validity ( for which reliable convergenge of the self - consistent procedure can be obtained . ) on the other hand , for ns calculations one needs to supply the relationship between energy density and pressure over a very wide range of densities .",
    "the eos at the lowest / highest densities have been derived with different methods , usually coupling available parametrizations of different eoss @xcite . here ,",
    "in the effort of keeping internal consistency as far as possible , we first obtain nucleon effective masses by interpolating the available predictions to the free - space value ( to cover the small low - density part , approximately @xmath113 @xmath114 ) and extrapolating to the higher densities ( approximately @xmath115 @xmath114 ) . with the masses",
    "thus generated , we then proceed to the usual ( microscopic ) calculation of the energy per particle everywhere in the needed range .",
    "( notice that the calculation of the @xmath31-matrix , and ultimately of the energy / particle , can proceed as long as effective masses are provided , as the momentum - independent part of the single - nucleon potential in eq .",

    "the nucleon effective masses originate from the ( attractive ) scalar potential in the dirac equation , which , in turn , is sensitive mostly to the scalar meson @xmath12 . as density increases ,",
    "short - range contributions become dominant over intermediate - range attraction .",
    "this results into the observed lesser sensitivity of the effective masses to increasing density .",

    "3 we show the energy density , @xmath88 , as a function of the baryon number density , @xmath8 , calculated with the bonn a , b , and c potentials . the pressure , @xmath87 , as a function of @xmath8 is shown in the lower panel of fig .  3 .",
    "we also note that our predictions are reasonably consistent with most recent constraints on neutron and symmetric matter pressure obtained through medium energy heavy ion collisions @xcite . for the reasons discussed earlier ,",
    "hardly any model dependence is seen in the pure @xmath111 system .",
    "accordingly , very small differences can be expected among the ns properties computed from pure neutron matter using the three potentials under consideration .",
    "( we reiterate that this is due to the relationship among these potentials in particular , and does not imply model independence in general . ) next we discuss the eos for @xmath0-stable matter .",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy determines the proton fraction in @xmath0-equilibrium , and , in turn , the cooling rate and neutrino emitting processes .",

    "this is to be expected , since a system with some @xmath163=0 component is generally more attractive ( mostly through the @xmath164 partial wave ) than a pure @xmath163=1 system .",
    "this point will be looked at more closely in the next subsection .",
    "the symmetry energy and the proton fraction in @xmath0-stable matter are displayed in fig .",
    "we observe that the symmetry energy ( upper frame ) tends to saturate and eventually decreases with density , a behavior qualitatively similar to the one seen in the proton fraction ( middle frame ) . from the lower panel of fig .  5",
    ", we see that the addition of muons increases the proton fraction noticeably . in particular , the maximum proton fraction increases from 0.11 to about 0.13 ( with bonn b ) .",
    "we recall that a proton fraction larger than approximately @xmath165 would allow a critical cooling mechanism for the neutron star via the direct urca processes @xcite . on the other hand , due to the behavior of the predicted symmetry energy ( the crucial player in the determination of the proton fraction ) ,",

    "first , we observe that from eq .",
    "( 34 ) one can write @xmath168 which clearly displays the significance of the symmetry energy as the energy shift between neutron and symmetric matter .",
    "thus , the behavior of @xmath139 reflects the relationship between @xmath169 and @xmath170 as a function of density .",
    "what we observe in the present calculation is that the energy per particle in symmetric matter becomes more and more repulsive with increasing density , eventually approaching the one of neutron matter . within the meson model , this can be understood in terms of the competing roles of the intermediate - range attraction ( provided by the scalar meson @xmath12 and the iterated one - pion exchange ) and the short - range repulsion ( generated by the vector meson @xmath10 ) , as we describe next .",
    "neutron matter is generally a more repulsive system because it lacks the contribution from t=0 waves , some of which are very attractive at normal nuclear densities ( hence , for instance , the crucial role of the @xmath164 state in nuclear binding ) . on the other hand , as density increases",
    ", short - range repulsion becomes the dominant contribution to the nn interaction .",
    "furthermore , in the dbhf calculations the ( repulsive ) spin - orbit interaction is strongly enhanced due to the relativistic effective mass in the obe potential .",
    "therefore , keeping in mind that only t=1 states contribute to the energy of neutron matter while both isospin states contribute to the energy of nuclear matter , if major t=0 partial waves become increasingly repulsive at short distances , it is possible for the energy of symmetric matter to grow at a faster rate and eventually approach the neutron matter eos .",
    "this is just what we observe in our model , as can be seen from fig .  7 , where we compare the energy per particle in symmetric and neutron matter up to very high densities .",
    "( the arguments above also explain why the eoss for neutron matter and @xmath0-stable matter are very close to each other , cf .",
    "fig .  4 .",
    ")        to explore this further as well as check internal consistency , we have performed some diagnostic tests .",
    "we find that the contributions to the average potential energy of symmetric matter from _ only _ @xmath171 are -18.75 mev , -22.75 mev , and 5.554 mev at @xmath25=1.4 , 2.0 , and 2.5 @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "similarly , including _ only _ the @xmath164 and @xmath173 states , we find ( for the same fermi momenta ) -18.74 mev , -10.04 mev , and 18.16 mev .",
    "a correct way to state the result of the above tests is to say that , in the presence of repulsive forces only ( a scenario simulated by the presence of high - density ) , nuclear matter would be a more repulsive system than neutron matter ( for the same @xmath25 ) .    at some critical density , signaled by the symmetry energy turning negative , it would then be possible for a pure neutron system to become more stable than symmetric matter , a phenomenon referred to as _ isospin separation instability _ @xcite . clearly , the value of such critical density depends upon the relative degrees of attraction and repulsion in the particular model under consideration .",
    "( figure 5 suggests that in the present model this would happen at densities well above ten times nuclear matter density . )",
    "it is of course possible that contributions not included in our model would soften the eos in such a way as to alter the balance between the curves shown in fig .  7 and , in turn , the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "this is precisely among the aspects we wish to learn about with this and future studies ( namely , domain of validity of the meson - theoretic picture , density dependence of the repulsive core , etc ... ) .",
    "systematic calculations based not on phenomenology but on a consistent theoretical framework ( in spite of its inherent limitations ) , together with stringent constraints , can help achieve that purpose .",
    "our main conclusion at this point is that empirical constraints specifically on the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy would provide some clear and direct information on the short - range nature of the nuclear force .",
    "in fig .  8 we show the total masses and radii versus the stellar central density , @xmath174 . as expected in the light of our previous discussion , the ns properties computed from the eos of neutron matter are essentially the same for all of the three potentials applied here .",
    "consistent with the observations contained in subsection 3.3 , the @xmath0-stable matter eos , being only slightly softer than the pure neutron matter eos , yields similar predictions , although radii tend to be smaller at higher central densities . in summary the neutron matter eos from dbhf calculations",

    "of course , every numerical extrapolation / interpolation involves uncertainties of some degree . to investigate to",
    "what extent the ns properties are sensitive to variations of @xmath184 , we have performed numerous tests all of which verify that the predicted ns masses and radii are not affected significantly by moderate variations of the nucleon effective mass .",
    "for instance , uncertainty of 20% in the high density effective mass results in approximately 2.9% variation in the ns maximum mass , 1.54% in the radius , and about 0.31% in the central density ( e.g. bonn b , dbhf , neutron matter : @xmath185 , @xmath186 km , @xmath187 ) .",

    "we have presented systematic calculations of ns limiting masses and radii using relativistic eoss .",
    "we have considered the case of pure neutron matter and nuclear matter in @xmath0-equilibrium .",

    "we have discussed this issue in considerable details and stressed the importance of reliable experimental information to set stringent constraints for theoretical predictions of the symmetry energy at high density .",
    "after overviewing presently available empirical information , we conclude that our dbhf - based predictions of ns maximum masses are somewhat high , indicating that repulsion in the high - density eos should be reduced ( again , keeping in mind that the difference in pressure between neutron and symmetric matter will primarily control the radii ) .",
    "it is likely that other mechanisms , not included in the present hadronic model , may take place in the stellar interior which are likely to soften the eos .",
    "pions and kaons may be likely to condensate in the interior of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed upon that pion / kaon populations increase the proton fraction and might cause a rapid cooling via the direct urca process . the stellar matter eos could soften considerably due to pion / kaon condensations , since these mechanisms tend to lower the symmetry energy .",
    "in addition , at higher densities different species of hyperons appear in the ns composition which also results in a softening of the stellar matter eos .",
    "the expected transition to quark matter at higher densities would lower the energy and soften eos .",
    "therefore , the present set of results give us confidence in our relativistic microscopic approach as a reasonable baseline from which to proceed .",
    "another important issue is the effect magnetization may have on the eos , namely , how the energy per particle changes if matter in the stellar interior becomes spin - polarized . as a next step towards a better and more complete understanding of the physics of neutron stars , we are presently extending our framework to include the description of spin - polarized neutron / nuclear matter .",
