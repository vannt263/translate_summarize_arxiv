    "one of the most important properties of the quark - gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider is its near - ideal fluid behavior , indicated by the small ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath0 @xcite , which we assume to imply strong coupling .",
    "a very useful tool to study strongly coupled gauge theories is the ads / cft correspondence : in its original form @xcite , ads / cft correspondence is an equivalence of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional @xmath1 super - yang - mills ( sym ) gauge theory and the type iib string theory on @xmath2 spacetime . using this conjecture and by taking the limit @xmath3 one can study this gauge theory at strong coupling by studying classical , two - derivative ( super)gravity .",
    "because of this very useful aspect of the ads / cft correspondence , one is tempted to use thermal @xmath1 sym to study and understand properties of finite - temperature qcd",
    ". however , there are significant differences between these two theories , most of them which originate from the conformal invariance of @xmath1 sym : this gives rise to a trivial , temperature - independent speed of sound ( @xmath4 ) , vanishing bulk viscosity , absence of phase transition , etc .",
    "in addition , lattice gauge theory results for the qcd trace anomaly @xcite show significant violation of the conformal invariance near the crossover temperature @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in order to capture these important phenomenological features of finite - temperature qcd , we are led to consider conformally non - invariant gravity theories with thermodynamics properties that can match the relevant qcd phenomenology .",
    "according to the holographic dictionary of the original ads / cft correspondence , a scalar field ( dilaton ) @xmath6 in the bulk of @xmath7 space is dual to the @xmath8 operator in the @xmath1 sym at the boundary of that space . assuming that this dictionary holds in general and that the thermodynamics in large-@xmath9 qcd is dominated by the adjoint degrees of freedom",
    ", we will look for models with a non - trivial dilaton profile , with aim to reproduce the non - trivial qcd thermodynamics .",
    "the simplest bottom - up effective realization of a gravity theory dual to a non - conformal gauge theory is a 5-dimensional gravity theory coupled to a scalar field ( dilaton ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dilaton potential , @xmath12 is the 5-dimensional gravitational constant and @xmath13 is the 5-dimensional metric .",
    "the first constraint will come from the requirement that the potential should give asymptotically ( @xmath14 ) @xmath7 spacetime , which translates into the conformal invariance of the dual field theory in uv . in order to obtain the @xmath7 spacetime with radius @xmath15 as @xmath16 , the potential must asymptote to a negative constant ,",
    "so in general it needs to have the following form : @xmath17 such a potential translates into a relevant deformation of the conformal field theory : @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the scale of the deformation and @xmath20 is the uv dimension of the field theory operator @xmath21 dual to @xmath6 .",
    "the dimension of the operator is determined from @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( the larger root ) and @xmath24 in order for the deformation to be relevant .",
    "this requirement of asymptotically conformal field theory originates from the idea @xcite of making the connection with qcd by matching the dimension @xmath20 of @xmath21 to the dimension of @xmath8 in qcd at some uv scale @xmath25 ; this uv matching to qcd essentially means that the asymptotic freedom of qcd gets replaced ( or approximated ) by conformal invariance .",
    "therefore , our dual theory will not be asymptotically free , which is also already visible from the fact that @xmath0 is @xmath26 at all temperatures @xcite , since we neglected the higher derivative terms in the action ( [ pot1 ] ) .",
    "this in turn means that the validity of our model should not be extended to temperatures too far above or too far below the crossover temperature @xmath5 .",
    "a natural choice for one of the terms in the potential is @xmath27 , since this term interpolates between a constant potential for small @xmath6 ( the cft limit ) and @xmath28 ( which gives a constant , @xmath29-dependent speed of sound ) for large @xmath6 and , as discussed in @xcite , should give a temperature - dependent speed of sound .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 gives the value of the speed of sound in the ir ( and will be numerically determined by fitting the lattice results ) , but it also fixes the dimension @xmath20 , according to ( [ pot2 ] ) . in order to have more freedom in choosing this dimension , we will introduce an additional @xmath30 term in the potential .",
    "we will also introduce @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms to fine - tune the fit of the cross - over behavior of the lattice results .",
    "finally , our potential has the following form @xcite : @xmath33 a similar bottom - up approach has been studied in @xcite , where the authors explored the role played by the gauge theory s beta function in the construction of the scalar field potential in the gravity theory .",
    "we will use the following ansatz for the metric in the einstein frame @xmath34 which is dictated by the required symmetries @xcite and where the so(3,1 ) boost invariance in @xmath35 direction is broken by the finite temperature , i.e. presence of the black hole with regular horizon at some finite @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 . in this ansatz",
    "we still have some gauge freedom left to reparametrize the radial direction @xmath38 , so we will follow @xcite and use the gauge choice @xmath39 , which means that the conformal ( uv ) boundary is at @xmath40 . with this gauge choice and ansatz ( [ lat1 ] )",
    "we can solve the equations of motion from the action ( [ pot1 ] ) with potential of the form ( [ pot4 ] ) using the method developed in @xcite in which one constructs a nonlinear master differential equation for a generating function @xmath41 , from which one then obtains all three unknown functions in ( [ lat1 ] ) , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "once we solve the equations of motion , we can find the entropy density and temperature using hawking s formulas : @xmath45 from here we can then find the speed of sound as @xmath46 and other thermodynamic quantities . since we now have the speed of sound @xmath47 dependent on the parameters of the potential ( [ pot4 ] ) , we can numerically determine these parameters by fitting our results to the lattice qcd data ( with dynamical fermions ) from the hotqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "satisfactory fits were obtained by using the following values for the parameters in the potential : @xmath48 , which corresponds to dimension @xmath49 .",
    "our fit together with the lattice results is shown in figure 1 ( leftmost plot ) and after fitting the speed of sound all other thermodynamic quantities are automatically fitted as well ( e.g. trace anomaly , center plot ) . in",
    "the plots also indicated is the critical temperature @xmath5 , which we define as the temperature where the speed of sound has a minimum .",
    "one must also define a rule for converting the temperature in gev ( as a function of which the lattice results are reported ) and the temperature in @xmath50 units , or the ads units ( as a function of which one obtains holographic results ) , in order to be able to compare both of them on the same plot .",
    "we do that by finding @xmath51 in ads units , where the holographic speed of sound reaches minimum , and by postulating a linear conversion rule @xmath52 , we obtain the same shapes of the thermodynamical quantities as functions of temperature as the ones from the lattice .",
    "we now introduce a quark of mass @xmath53 , which is dual to a curved string in the bulk stretching from a d4 brane at @xmath54 to the horizon @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we are working in the probe approximation , where one neglects the backreaction of the metric due to the introduction of the string . assuming quantum corrections to be negligible , the dynamics of the string is governed by the classical nambu - goto action : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , squared fundamental string length , @xmath58 are the string worldsheet coordinates , @xmath59 are its spacetime coordinates and @xmath60 is the coupling between the string and the dilaton @xmath6 , which originates when one expresses the string frame metric ( which directly enters the nambu - goto action ) in terms of the einstein frame metric ( [ lat1 ] ) .",
    "for this coupling we use the result from the five - dimensional non - critical string theory @xmath61 @xcite . according to the gauge / gravity dictionary ,",
    "polyakov loops are related to the string action : @xmath62 and since the nambu - goto action ( [ eloss1 ] ) contains @xmath63 ( at this moment the only undetermined parameter in our model ) , we can use the lattice results for the polyakov loop @xcite and by fitting the prediction of our model to the data ( using the procedure from @xcite ) , determine @xmath63 . in that way",
    ", our model is completely constrained by the lattice data and the energy loss then becomes a prediction . from the fit in the rightmost plot in figure 1",
    ", we see that we get roughly @xmath64 .",
    "this means that , in principle , @xmath63-corrections ( in the string worldsheet fluctuations and in the effective gravity action ) can be important in this case , and they must be explicitly calculated in order to see their effect on thermodynamics and on the energy loss .",
    "assuming that the quark is heavy enough and that the range of relevant temperatures is low enough so that @xmath65 , we can evaluate the quark energy loss by using the trailing string model @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the velocity of the quark ( assumed uniformly moving ) and @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 .",
    "of course , in the cft limit this expression becomes the familiar drag force @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the trailing string model is applicable to both charm and bottom quarks ( in the sense that @xmath65 ) and that they obey the usual relativistic dispersion relation @xmath71 , we can compute their energy loss in our non - conformal holographic model using the formula ( [ eloss4 ] ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the energy loss as a function of temperature for a fixed momentum and as a function of momentum for several fixed temperatures . in all plots the energy loss from the non - conformal model",
    "is compared to the cft limit of our model , where the same @xmath64 was used .",
    "+    from figure 2 we see that a significant deviation from the cft results is found for temperatures around @xmath5 , where the trace anomaly is maximal",
    ". this difference should affect the relative ratio of the energy loss observables , such as @xmath72 , since we expect that a quark traveling through a realistic , expanding quark - gluon plasma spends significant amount of time in the temperature region around @xmath5 .",
    "gauge / string duality gives us means to address the violation of conformal invariance in a strongly coupled plasma near @xmath5 and see how the trace anomaly and the details of equation of state affect the energy loss of heavy quarks .",
    "we showed that , in principle , the details of equation of state are important for the heavy quark energy loss in the crossover region ( near @xmath5 ) and may affect observables such as the nuclear modification factor of jets in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
