    "many lasers are formed from high - symmetry microcavity geometries that have degenerate resonant modes , most famously ring and disc resonators in which the clockwise and counterclockwise circulating modes are degenerate ( having the same complex resonant frequency ) . in a linear system , any superposition of these solutions also satisfies maxwell s equations , but above - threshold lasers have nonlinear gain that allows only certain superpositions ; it is well known that the only stable lasing solutions of a ring are the circulating solutions @xmath0 , as opposed to the standing - wave modes @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , more recent microcavities often have other symmetry groups supporting degeneracies @xcite , such as the 6-fold symmetry that commonly occurs in photonic - crystal resonators @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : overview ] ) , or more generally the @xmath3 symmetry group ( @xmath4-fold rotations and @xmath4 mirror planes ) for @xmath5  @xcite , and much less is known about the lasing solutions in such cases .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : overview ] ) gives examples of degenerate lasing modes in @xmath3 geometries .",
    "previous work @xcite showed how the steady - state degenerate solutions of salt ( steady - state ab - initio lasing theory @xcite ) could be found from an educated guess of a superposition of the threshold degenerate modes , and how their stability could be computed _",
    "numerically_. in this work , we show rigorously using degenerate perturbation theory on the salt equations that the circulating modes used in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with standing - wave modes that are linear combinations of the clockwise and counterclockwise circulating modes , are the _ only _ solutions to salt in the @xmath3 degenerate case .",
    "we complement those results with semi - analytical _ closed - form _",
    "expressions for the stability eigenvalues of the maxwell ",
    "bloch equations linearized about these lasing solutions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : threshold - perturbation - theory ] ) .",
    "we find that the only stable solutions right above threshold ( with one isolated exception that is unattainable under normal circumstances ) are typically the circulating ones .",
    "an important observation of our paper is that @xmath3 symmetries experience a spontaneous symmetry breaking due to nonlinearity above threshold , and analysis of the resulting `` chiral '' symmetry  @xcite is key to stability of the lasing mode .",
    "these analytical solutions then give us a starting point for a _ numerical _ method to compute the degenerate solutions far above threshold , extending our earlier work on computational methods for non - degenerate salt  @xcite .",
    "our numerical method , in turn , relies on a new semi - analytical technique ( sec .",
    "[ sub : forcing - the - degeneracy ] ) to address problems created by numerical symmetry breaking ( e.g. , by a low - symmetry computational grid ) that would otherwise spoil the nonlinear salt solutions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a full linear - stability analysis ( sec .",
    "[ sub : stability - analysis summary ] ) was applied numerically to the maxwell ",
    "bloch equations of lasing in order to check whether the steady state was stable , and stability of the solution was also analyzed when the degeneracy was broken by a perturbation .",
    "this generalized many earlier works on ring - laser solutions and perturbations thereof  @xcite .",
    "it reproduced the stability of the circulating solution near threshold , and found that far above the lasing threshold ( where nonlinearities are strong ) the circulating solution may become unstable ( replaced by an oscillating limit - cycle solution ) .",
    "conversely , it was found there that slightly breaking the symmetry caused the ( now nearly degenerate ) solution to become unstable ( e.g. , oscillating between clockwise and counterclockwise modes ) in the vicinity of the threshold , but that a stable solution re - appears further above threshold by means of cooperative frequency locking  @xcite .",
    "the present paper complements those results in two ways .",
    "first , near threshold , we are able to both _ solve for _ the steady - state lasing modes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : threshold - perturbation - theory ] ) and evaluate their stability ( sec .",
    "[ sub : stability - analysis summary ] ) _ analytically _ , by perturbation theory in the basis of the degenerate linear solutions at lasing threshold , and we generalize the notion of a circulating laser mode to other symmetry groups and establish its stability near threshold .",
    "even the degeneracy itself is somewhat unusual above threshold , because the nonlinear gain spontaneously breaks some of the symmetry in noncircular ( @xmath3 with @xmath6 ) geometries , leaving one with a `` chiral '' degeneracy as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : stability - analysis summary ] , ref .",
    "@xcite , and appendix  [ sec : appendix allowed lasing modes ] .",
    "second , we develop a numerical solution technique for _ far above _ threshold in sec .  [ sub : forcing - the - degeneracy ] , generalizing earlier salt methods , where a numerical nonlinear solver is the only option ; in this regime , our focus is on finding a degenerate lasing mode in salt ( if one exists ) , and we defer to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for checking its stability after a solution far above threshold is found .",
    "symmetry , the two eigenfunctions ( of which only the real part is shown ) are proportional to @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( here , @xmath9 ) . for a homogeneous dielectric square ( @xmath10 inside a square of length 1 ) , the eigenfunctions are @xmath11 rotations of one another . here , the order of the irreducible representation ( irrep ) is @xmath12 , which is the only possibility for @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath11 rotation is an exact symmetry of the geometry , so there is an exact degeneracy even for the numerical grid . for @xmath14 , the symmetry group of the regular hexagon , as in this example of te modes ( with the transverse magnetic field @xmath15 shown ) in a 2d slab with air holes ( described in further detail in sec .",
    "[ sub : examples ] ) , the two eigenfunctions have no immediately obvious symmetry operation that transforms between them , but are in fact still degenerate ( here @xmath12 , and there also exists an @xmath16 irrep with its own degenerate pair ) . in all three cases ( and in fact for all @xmath3 ) , the standing - wave modes have mirror planes that are @xmath11 rotations from one another , and the two standing - wave modes have opposite parities across these mirror planes .",
    "[ fig : overview ] ]    above threshold , the salt equations @xcite provide an elegant formulation of the problem of steady - state lasing modes : they analytically eliminate the time dependence from the maxwellbloch equations to obtain a nonlinear maxwell - like eigenproblem @xmath17 for the lasing electric fields @xmath18 and frequencies @xmath19 , in which the permittivity @xmath20 depends nonlinearly on both the field and frequency ( here , the speed of light @xmath21 has been set to unity ) . this equation can be efficiently solved numerically by adapting standard techniques from computational electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "as described below and also in previous work  @xcite , the salt framework applies very naturally to lasing of degenerate microcavities , assuming a stable degenerate steady state exists , but it turns out that there are two complications .",
    "first , in order to apply a numerical nonlinear solver to a large system of nonlinear equations like salt , one needs to have a good `` starting guess '' for the solution . in the non - degenerate case ,",
    "the starting guess is supplied by the threshold solution , but for a degenerate threshold there are infinitely many superpositions . picking the wrong starting guess , e.g. , the @xmath22 mode in a ring , would lead salt to converge to an unstable solutions , but our near - threshold perturbutation theory supplies us with a correct guess ( which turns out to be the @xmath3 analog of the circulating solution in the ring ) .",
    "second , there is a tricky complication that arises purely from _ numerical _ effects when a practical computational method is applied to spatially discretize the salt equations . in principle , what one would like to find from a degenerate salt solver is a lasing mode ( e.g. , the clockwise circulating mode of a ring ) with a passive pole ( a pole of the green s function linearized around the lasing solution ) that coincides with the lasing frequency ( there will be two possible lasing modes , e.g. , clockwise and counterclockwise , but only one solution can exist at a time with nonzero amplitude due to the nonlinearity ; which one is found will depend on the starting `` guess '' of the salt solver ) .",
    "however , when one discretizes a microcavity geometry for a numerical solver , e.g. , in a finite - difference or finite - element method , often the discretization itself breaks the symmetry and hence breaks the degeneracy slightly , causing the passive pole to separate from the lasing frequency . in a linear eigenproblem , this is at worst a minor annoyance , because from the symmetry group one can easily identify resonance modes that `` should '' be degenerate @xcite . in the nonlinear problem",
    ", however , the splitting can prevent the desired solution ( e.g. , the circulating mode ) from existing in the salt equations , because the solver can no longer pick arbitrary superpositions of the formerly degenerate modes , as described in sec .",
    "[ sub : forcing - the - degeneracy ] .",
    "( if the discretization breaks the degeneracy , but the pump strength is high enough , a single - mode circulating solution _ may _ still come back into existance , due to strong nonlinear self - interaction effects @xcite .",
    "this effect can provide a fast and easy way to initially evaluate the field profile of a discretized geometry that is not exactly symmetric , and hence does not have an exact degeneracy .",
    "however , the conditions under which this effect can happen are not completely understood , as we explain in sec .",
    "[ sec : discretization_breaking ] , and we wish to deal with the discretization symmetry breaking in a more systematic and provably reliable manner . ) to fix the problem of broken degeneracy from discretization , we found a simple way to uniquely restore the degeneracy in a way that both guarantees convergence to the correct solution ( as the discretization is refined ) , that generalizes to an arbitrary number of lasing modes ( in sec .  [",
    "sub : multimode discretization method ] ) , and that is , at worst , a few times more computationally expensive than our non - degenerate solver .",
    "the equations of salt are derived from the maxwell ",

    "@xmath23    where @xmath24 is the `` positive - frequency '' component of the electric field [ with @xmath25 and the physical field given by @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the `` cold - cavity '' permittivity ( not including the gain transition ) , @xmath28 is the polarization describing a transition ( of frequency @xmath29 and linewidth @xmath30 ) between two atomic energy levels , @xmath31 is the population inversion between those two levels ( with relaxation rate @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 is the strength of a pumping process driving the inversion .",
    "additionally , for convenience , one chooses units such that the following factors are set to unity : the dipole moment matrix element of the two level system , planck s constant @xmath34 , and the speed of light @xmath21 . using the stationary inversion approximation",

    "this condition is evidently true when any pair of modes is either exactly degenerate , or situated very far apart from each other in frequency space .",

( [ eq : maxwell  bloch ] ) reduces to the salt equation @xcite    @xmath45\\mathbf{e}_{\\mu},\\label{eq : salt general}\\ ] ]    for the unknowns @xmath18 and @xmath37 , where @xmath46 is the steady - state population inversion , which depends nonlinearly on the electric fields and lasing frequencies of all lasing modes : @xmath47 the intensity term in the denominator of eq .",

    "however , a rigorous evaluation of the stability of the salt solution requires a linear stability analysis based on the mb equations @xcite .",

    "we give analytical results for this stability analysis for the near - threshold degenerate case . )",
    "so far , most cases in which salt has been applied have dealt with either single lasing modes or multimode regimes in which frequencies are far apart .",
    "when two lasing frequencies are close but not exactly degenerate , there is non - negligible beating and salt is invalid .",
    "however , when two lasing modes are _ exactly _ degenerate , we find that salt is still perfectly valid , because there is an exact steady - state solution of the mb equations ( for a single lasing mode ) , provided that interference between the two degenerate modes is taken into account .",
    "of course , it is possible that a degeneracy in the linear regime may split in the presence of the laser nonlinearity above threshold .",
    "however , if a degeneracy persists ( and we have observed that it is guaranteed to do so for @xmath3 symmetry - induced degeneracies , because of the `` chiral '' symmetry of the lasing mode as discussed in appendix .  [",
    "sec : degeneracy in cn ] ) , our method will find it .",
    "the literature on degenerate lasing modes has almost invariably dealt with whispering - gallery modes in microdisks and ring resonators @xcite .",
    "many of these earlier works discussed the stability of traveling - wave modes in ring resonators under perturbations that break the symmetry @xcite .",
    "a very limited number of other works on degenerate lasing modes in other geometries exist @xcite , which were mostly experimental and focused on the linear cavity rather than the nonlinear lasing regime .",
    "however , the microdisk is just one of many examples of a setting where one can find degenerate resonant modes that can lase : there are a great variety of other symmetric geometries where degeneracies can occur @xcite .",
    "so far , the problem of above - threshold degenerate modes in lasers has not been studied systematically for the general @xmath3 case .",
    "the presence of degenerate eigenvalues is typically a direct consequence of symmetry . for systems with @xmath3 symmetry for @xmath5 ( @xmath4-fold rotational symmetry with @xmath4 mirror planes , the symmetry of the regular @xmath4-gon ) , the existence of 2d irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the symmetry group corresponds to 2-fold degeneracies .",
    "below , we therefore refer to 2-fold degenerate modes ( at lasing threshold ) as corresponding to a 2d irrep , and we exploit some known properties of these irreps in deriving selection rules @xcite for overlap integrals . for systems with @xmath51 symmetry (",
    "@xmath4-fold rotational symmetry without mirror symmetry , e.g. , a `` chiral '' spiral structure with @xmath4 arms ) , the combination of group theory and electromagnetic reciprocity again supports 2-fold degenerate solutions @xcite ( see also appendix  [ sec : degeneracy in cn ] for a review ) . even with @xmath3 symmetry",
    ", we explain below that the nonlinear hole - burning term for lasers above threshold typically breaks the mirror symmetry , so the reciprocity argument for @xmath51 symmetry is crucial to maintaining the degeneracy of the lasing mode and a passive pole .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : overview ] ) shows three examples of symmetric geometries , along with examples of degenerate eigenfunctions .",
    "ordinarily , salt assumes that all distinct modes have distinct frequencies , i.e. @xmath52 when @xmath53 , which gives the stationary - inversion expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : d(x ) inversion ] ) when higher - frequency @xmath43 ( @xmath54 ) terms are dropped .",
    "however , when there are degeneracies , the mb equations will have terms of the form @xmath55 where @xmath53 , since @xmath56 and one can no longer drop the @xmath57 term .",

    "( [ eq : e123 ] ) we see that the degenerate pair acts as a single mode that is a superposition of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the solution to the lasing degenerate problem can be portrayed in two equivalent pictures .",
    "first , we can think of the linear combination @xmath69 as a single mode that satisfies the equation @xmath70 [ where the external pump @xmath33 may be spatially dependent , as noted before ] .",
    "second , we can think of the two modes as _ separately _ satisfying the two equations @xmath71 the existence of a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1mode_salt ] ) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2mode_salt ] ) .",
    "the reason is that eq .",

    "( [ eq:1mode_salt ] ) only enforces a single eigenvalue .",
    "prior to lasing , suppose that we have a 2-fold degenerate solution , corresponding to a double pole in the green function .",
    "as the gain increases , and even when the system passes threshold and becomes nonlinear , poles can shift ( and degeneracies may split ) but poles do not appear or disappear discontinuously , so we should always expect there to be two poles ( in the linearized green s function around the salt solution ) arising from the original degenerate pair .",
    "given this fact , if we solve the single - mode salt equations as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1mode_salt ] ) , there is the danger that the other pole is unstable . as we show in appendix .",
    "[ sec : appendix stability calculations ] , close to lasing threshold the zeroth order stability analysis ( in the pump strength increment ) simply depends on the salt eigenproblem : if a salt pole lies above the real-@xmath72 axis , then a lasing solution is necessarily unstable , whereas salt poles below the real axis can not induce instability .",
    "if a pole lies _ on _ the real axis , higher - order calculations are required to check stability as described in sec .",

    "@xcite only translates one salt solution into another , and does not translate the full maxwell  bloch solutions since it does not keep track of @xmath44 . because the exact maxwell  bloch stability eigenvalue @xmath141 depends on @xmath44 , as explained in appendix  [ sub : region - of - validity ] ( only the first - order term @xmath156 is independent ) , and salt solutions do not , this method of translating a hole - burning term to an artificially - designed pump profile at a higher threshold does not account for the effects of @xmath44 .",
    "second , it would be interesting to extend this sort of perturbative salt / stability analysis to other lasing systems besides @xmath51 and @xmath3 symmetries .",
    "for example , in a 3d photonic - crystal cavity @xcite one could have cubic symmetry and threefold degeneracies , or one could have even greater degeneracies in spherical resonators .",
