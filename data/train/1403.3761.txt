    "the very fact that abrikosov vortices in the vicinity of josephson junctions affect the junction properties is well documented and not surprising since the phase associated with vortex affects the junction phase difference .",
    "@xcite recent experiments with a vortex trapped in one of the banks of an edge - type planar junction in a thin - film superconducting strip showed that the vortex causes an extra phase difference on the junction that depends on the vortex position .",
    "@xcite the effect is strong in particular when the vortex is close to the junction , the situation when the junction behavior is changed from the conventional ",

    "here we study how the field dependence of maximum critical tunneling currents @xmath0 , commonly called the fraunhofer pattern , changes when a vortex trapped in one of the junction thin - film banks changes its position . in principle , this effect can be utilized for manipulating josephson currents by controlling the vortex position .",

    "the self - field of the current @xmath18 is of the order @xmath20 , whereas the second term on the left - hand side of eq.([london ] ) is of the order @xmath21 .",
