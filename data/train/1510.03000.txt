    "directed motion of colloidal particles via self - created gradients or fields has become an area of significant scientific interest and potential .",
    "drug or gene delivery @xcite , neutralizing pollutants @xcite , directed transport of chemical reagents @xcite , and mixing enhancement @xcite can be mentioned here . with recent developments in the collective behavior of self - propelling particles @xcite ,",
    "the interest has shifted towards creating active soft materials that , in addition to operating autonomously , also have the ability to sense their surroundings and process this information into smart decisions .",
    "after a decade , it is now well understood that an asymmetric surface chemical reaction on a colloidal particle is able to produce autonomous motion .",
    "this observation has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in the particular case of non - electrolyte solutions ,",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite utilized a continuum description based on phoresis theory @xcite to study the locomotion of spherical janus particles due to a surface chemical reaction . in this case",
    ", a chemical reaction takes place at a portion of the particle surface and produces a nonuniform distribution of the product and reactant solutes which in turn induces a diffusiophoretic motion @xcite .",
    "a similar idea was applied for a thermophoretically self - propelled janus particle , which consumes an imposed laser energy on half of its surface , thus creating a nonuniform temperature field @xcite .",
    "in contrast , crdova - figueroa and brady @xcite applied a colloidal perspective to the problem of catalytically driven self - propulsion , in which a catalytic motor ( or motors ) does not have to be assumed to be large in comparison with the product ( or reactant ) solutes and the restriction for diluteness of solutes can be relaxed .",
    "therefore , the results obtained within this approach can be applied to other microscopic objects , such as proteins or even large molecules .",
    "current efforts in the study of catalytic motors include exploiting propulsion mechanisms and finding alternatives to guide their direction @xcite",
    ". moreover , self - propulsion was found even for a symmetric chemical reaction @xcite within a chemotaxis problem @xcite . there",
    ", self - propulsion emerges as a result of the instability of a stationary state ; its direction is determined by an initial perturbation in the solute concentration gradient .",
    "for example , the presence of a chemically passive particle ( or cargo ) connected to a catalytic one causes self - propulsion @xcite .",
    "this model provides a good representation of a cargo particle transported by the catalytic motor , a problem of crucial importance for a large number of applications . on a similar note , shklyaev _",
    "_ @xcite and michelin and lauga @xcite reported that self - propulsion of a particle with a uniform distribution of a surface reaction arises due to nonsphericity of the particle shape .",
    "a direct significance of this study is the realization that even for particle with uniform surface catalytic activity , a change to the surrounding distribution of reagents ( or solutes ) can occur which , consequently , creates perturbations ( or concentration gradients ) that directly affect particle diffusivity and the interaction force between nearby particles .",
    "an increasing number of experiments on catalytically - driven ( active ) colloidal particles have shown that the interaction of chemically active particles is more complicated than usual interaction of two nonreactive ( passive ) particles .",
    "indeed , each chemically active particle changes the distribution of product ( or reactant ) solutes which , in turn , alters the motion of the other particles . in this case , the motions of active particles are influenced not only by hydrodynamic interactions but also via diffusive interactions of the solute distribution generated ( or consumed ) at the surface of the active areas of each colloid with the boundary of other colloids .",
    "such is the case in the problem of multicomponent diffusion where a gradient in the concentration of one species can drive the flux of another @xcite .",
    "similarly , depletion flocculation occurs because small particles ( e.g. , polymers ) are excluded from a zone separating two nearly touching colloidal particles and the imbalanced osmotic pressure of the small particles causes an entropic attractive force leading to flocculation @xcite .",
    "depleted regions between two or more catalytically active colloids can unite and hinder or stop their autonomous motion .",
    "also , it has been reported recently that active suspensions exhibit perplexing collective behaviour such as swarming , predator - prey interactions and chemotaxis which are reminiscent of biological microorganisms @xcite .",
    "active catalytic microswimmers have been experimentally observed to form clusters @xcite which are `` live '' , i.e. the particles join and leave the clusters frequently .",
    "moreover , the experimental evidence indicates in addition to the large clusters , there are coexistent gas phases where the particles swim freely . in dilute suspensions , it was shown that the mean cluster size increases linearly with propulsion speed @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been observed for both purely repulsive and attractive suspensions with the only difference being the mean cluster size ( larger for attractive particles ) .",
    "this clustering and phase separation have also been investigated via simulations @xcite .",
    "the clustering and phase separation in active matter is driven by non - equilibrium rather than attractive interparticle forces .",
    "cates and tailleur @xcite have theoretically examine a phase separation for a model based on a run - and - tumble motion .",
    "they showed that a locally reduced mobility can result in dense regions where the directed motions of swimmers are blocked by their neighbors and a dilute gas of autonomously moving particles .",
    "+ a `` micromotor '' move in random directions at speeds of tens of microns per second . but",
    "collectively , catalytically - driven colloids immersed in a newtonian fluid are expected to behave as a complex fluid , but not in a traditional fashion @xcite .",
    "the interaction of catalytically - driven colloidal particles is expected to be largely mediated by the intervening fluid , hence , insight into the hydrodynamics associated with the motion of two particles is necessary for understanding their collective behavior .",
    "this is apparent in a recent study in which it was show that the near field hydrodynamic interaction acting between squirmers and confining walls is crucial to determine their collective motion @xcite .",
    "additionally , unlike a suspension of squirmers , the collective behavior of a suspension of catalytic particles can also be drastically influenced by phoretic effects @xcite , and hence a pure hydrodynamic model ( such as a squirmer model ) may not be adequate to capture the collective dynamics .    in this study , we take the first step to understand the collective behavior and dynamics of a suspension of catalytically active self - propelled particles . in",
    "so doing , we probe the pair interaction of two catalytically active colloids from a continuum framework in the context of self - diffusiophoresis @xcite .",
    "this mechanism relies on an unbalanced intermolecular interaction in a thin interaction layer @xmath3 caused by an asymmetric surface reaction around the colloid and thus results in a propulsion . in the limit of small interaction layer",
    "compared to the particle size ( i.e. @xmath4 ) , it has been shown @xcite that the intermolecular interaction generates a slip velocity @xmath5 on the particle surface which scales with the local solute concentration , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mobility coefficient , @xmath8 is the surface gradient operator and @xmath9 is the solute concentration evaluated at the particle surface ( see below for definitions ) .",
    "the validity of this approach has been examined from a micromechanical perspective @xcite and with molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "thus , to capture the `` swimming '' ( self - diffusiophoretic ) velocity of the particle , the equations governing solute distribution ( microstructure ) and hydrodynamics must be solved simultaneously .",
    "the self - diffusiophoretic velocity of a non - brownian catalytically active colloid in an infinite medium scales with the damkhler number , @xmath10 , and the pclet number , @xmath11 , where the former determines the relative importance of reaction rate to the solute diffusion and the later describes the ratio of the solute advection to the solute diffusion and @xmath12 is the first order kinetic constant , @xmath13 is the reactant solute diffusivity , @xmath14 is the particle radius and @xmath15 is the characteristic swimming velocity of the particle . for the reactivity of the particles ,",
    "a simple surface reaction model @xmath16 is assumed , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the reactant and product solutes , respectively , taking place uniformly solely on the cap region @xmath19 of the colloid and brings about a constant flux production of the solute @xmath18 , @xmath20 , on the reactive cap and elsewhere , there is a zero flux condition since the colloid is impenetrable to the solutes .",
    "the constant flux production assumption has been shown to be legitimate when considering a surface reaction with first order kinetics and @xmath21 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "additionally , at @xmath22 , the hydrodynamics and the equation governing the solute distribution are decoupled . utilizing the slip velocity argument ,",
    "the solute distribution can be obtained by solving a laplace equation subjected to a relevant boundary condition on the colloid surface and thereafter hydrodynamics can be solved to yield the dimensional self - diffusiophoretic velocity as @xcite , @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the above relation is deterministic , i.e. the time scale for brownian rotation of the particle @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the rotational diffusivity of the particle ) has been considered to be much longer than the time scale for directed motion , @xmath26 .",
    "this continuum approach has been used in a number of studies to probe the diffusiophoretic autonomous motion of a spheroidal particle @xcite , a spherical particle near a planar solid wall @xcite and in a simple shear flow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of finite rates of solute advection and surface reaction on the propulsion speed have been addressed in the literature @xcite .    here",
    ", a similar approach is used to address the pair interaction of two partially active colloids with arbitrary orientations .",
    "the orientation of each colloid is defined via a unit vector directed from the active to the passive poles of the colloid .",
    "continuum calculations are undertaken in which the repulsive interactions of the solute product with the colloids actuate the autonomous motions , and the reactive faces produce a constant flux of product solutes .",
    "the solute distribution around the particles is found by solving the diffusion equation exactly in a curvilinear bispherical coordinate .",
    "the translational and angular velocities of the particles at the stokes flow regime are obtained using the reynolds reciprocal theorem ( rrt ) @xcite based on an asymptotic approach in which the net interaction creates a slip velocity at the surface that actuates the motion @xcite .",
    "we consider first the axisymmetric locomotion of two partially active colloids along their line of centers where the active face of one colloid is oriented either directly in front of , or facing away from , the active ( or passive ) section of the other colloid . in this case , depending on the pair orientations , the colloids either move toward or away from each other without rotation . on the other hand , for non - axisymmetric motion , the analysis indicates that when two catalytically active colloids approach , they undergo rotations around axes perpendicular to the line of centers .",
    "the magnitude and direction of rotations are functions of the colloids separation distance , relative orientation and the areas of active sections , i.e. the colloids can rotate in such a way that the active surfaces face towards or away from each other and , consequently , the colloids assemble or escape .",
    "we discuss the hydrodynamics of diffusiophoretic motion of two colloids and demonstrate under what circumstances the active colloids can assemble or escape . this study is crucially important to illuminate the role of hydrodynamic interactions on collective behaviors of the self - propelled particles as these interactions are often neglected in theoretical studies and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the current study reveals a unique feature of suspensions of diffusiophoretically self - propelled particles compared to other active systems , namely `` chemical signaling '' , i.e. how the chemically active particles can be pushed ( or pulled ) away from regions where the local concentration of solute is high ( or low ) due to diffusive nature of the solute .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   [ s1 ] , we provide the formulation and the solution technique developed to solve the mass transfer and hydrodynamic equations and in   [ s2 ] the results and a discussion of the concentration field , particle velocities and pair trajectories of the catalytically driven colloids are given .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in ",
    "since the key feature here for autonomous motion is the concentration field around the colloids , the solute distribution in the presence of both colloids must be captured .",
    "thus , the mass transfer equation , which is a laplace equation can be solved in a set of orthogonal curvilinear bispherical coordinates @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ bis2 ] ) .",
    "we assume the colloids have similar radii @xmath14 and their center - to - center distance is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the colloids are partially active and the extent of their active regions is defined by two angles , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which vary between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath31 accounts for a passive particle while @xmath32 indicates a colloid that is catalytically active over its entire surface .",
    "furthermore , to investigate the relative orientation of the particles , we define a unit orientation vector associate with each colloid directing from the active to the passive poles .",
    "the inclination angles of the two colloids , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , can be considered as angles between their unit orientation vectors and the positive direction of center - to - center line ( @xmath35-direction ) ; these angles varies between @xmath31 and @xmath36 ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the motion of the particles is considered to be non - brownian ( @xmath37 ) and pseudosteady state and the hydrodynamics is in the stokes flow regime where the inertial terms can be neglected .",
    "a simple form for the activity of the colloidal particles is taken which consists of a constant flux production of solutes uniformly distributed on the catalytic surface .",
    "this assumption has been shown to be valid in the limits of small rate of reaction compared to the rate of solute diffusion , i.e. @xmath21 . for small solute in infinite dilution limit , the non - dimensional steady concentration field of the solute product at @xmath38 can be written as , @xmath39 with the following boundary conditions , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unit normal vector pointing outward to the surface of the @xmath42th colloid , @xmath43 is the non - dimensional concentration of the product solute , @xmath44 is the non - dimensional position vector with respect to the @xmath42th colloid center , @xmath45 accounts for the surface domain of the @xmath42th colloid , @xmath46 is the coverage function of colloid @xmath42 which is one in its active section and zero elsewhere and @xmath47 represents the scaled solute flux production for colloid @xmath42 defined as , @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the dimensional solute flux production for colloid @xmath42 .",
    "all variables mentioned above were non - dimensionalized according to the characteristic concentration of the solute @xmath50 and particle radius @xmath14 . to satisfy the boundary conditions at both colloid surfaces , we utilize a bispherical coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "bispherical coordinates are related to cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath51 ) with the following transformation @xmath52 note that the @xmath35-axis is always aligned in the direction of the center - to - center line of the particles .",
    "the range of coordinates are limited to @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for positive scale factor @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 represents a sphere whose center is located on the positive @xmath35-axis at point @xmath58 with radius of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the other sphere whose center is located on the negative @xmath35-axis at point @xmath61 with radius of @xmath62 ( see fig .",

    "the parameter @xmath56 is non - dimensional and can be related to the separation distance @xmath63 ( for two equal spheres ) according to , @xmath64 @xmath65 the general three - dimensional solution of solute distribution in bispherical coordinate can be found via the following _ ansatz _ , @xmath66p_n^m(\\cos \\alpha ) , \\label{laplacian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are unknown coefficients that must be determined by applying the boundary conditions on particle surfaces and @xmath71 is the associated legendre function of the first kind .",

    "additionally , analytical solutions to the problems @xmath122 have already been addressed in the literature and we utilize these solutions in our analysis @xcite .    to analyze the problem ( @xmath14 ) , the hydrodynamics ( eq .  [ hyd_1 ] and [ hyd_2 ] ) must be solved .",

    "therefore , we use the reynolds reciprocal theorem ( rrt ) @xcite to simplify the calculation of forces and torques on particles as explicit integrals in terms of the stress tensor of classical stokes flow problems involving translational and rotational motion of two spherical particles .",

    "inasmuch as the dipolar field around a colloidal particle decays at least as @xmath129 and @xmath130 , the far field area integral does not contribute to the calculation and can be neglected .    to evaluate the force and torque associated with problem ( @xmath14 ) which hereinafter we call propulsive force and torque denoted by @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , we take advantage of the detailed solutions of four fundamental problems explained in the literature ( see below for details ) in conjunction with rrt .",
