    "under the present schedule , both the united states laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo@xcite ) and the french / italian virgo @xcite will begin operation in the late 1990s . long before that time , theorists must lay a foundation for the study of gravitational radiation sources .",
    "part of this foundation involves the construction of detailed , parameterized models of the waveforms from expected sources ; another part involves the calculation of the anticipated sensitivity of the detector to each of these sources .",
    "calculation of these kinds are not only needed for ligo and virgo : design and technology studies for a laser gravitational - wave observatory in space ( lagos ) are currently being pursued@xcite and calculations of the sensitivity of lagos to appropriate sources are needed to guide these studies .    in this paper",
    "i address the problem of calculating the anticipated sensitivity of a detector , like ligo , virgo , or lagos , to an arbitrary source of gravitational radiation .",
    "the problem breaks up into two parts which i term _ detection _ and _ measurement . _",
    "to `` detect '' is to decide whether the observed detector output contains a signal from a particular source or is just an example of noise ; to `` measure '' is to assume the presence of a signal in the detector output and to characterize the signal in terms of the parameter(s ) that describe the source ( and its orientation with respect to the detector ) .",
    "echeverria@xcite recently examined some of these issues in the particular context of determining the precision with which one could characterize the mass and angular momentum of a perturbed kerr black hole from observations in a gravitational radiation detector .",
    "the foundation of his analysis was the construction of a quantity similar to the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , and he asserted that the parameters that characterize a signal observed in the output of the detector are those that maximized this quantity .",
    "this analysis is limited in two respects ( echeverria & finn@xcite ) :    1 .",
    "the validity of the formalism is restricted to the limit of high snr ; and 2 .",
    "the formalism can not determine the amplitude of the signal .",
    "in addition , the conceptual basis of this calculation is not compelling : the determination of the parameters characterizing a signal in a noisy detector does not proceed by maximizing the snr - like quantity defined by echeverria@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the techniques developed here are all based upon the construction of probabilities and probability densities . for the problem of detection ,",
    "i construct the probability that the observed detector output is consistent with the presence ( or absence ) of a signal . in the case of the measurement problem , where the detector output is assumed to include a signal , the quantity constructed is the probability density that describes the likelihood of a given signal parameterization .",
    "in  [ sec : detection - and - measurement ] i examine the twin processes of detection and measurement from the point of view of probability theory .",
    "the parameters characterizing a signal identified in the output of a noisy detector are defined to be those _ most likely _ to have resulted in the observed detector output .",
    "some of the results described in this section are known elsewhere in the context of data analysis : they are included here for completeness and so that they may be compared with the techniques employed in echeverria@xcite . in  [ sec : sensitivity ]",
    "i show how these same techniques can be exploited to evaluate the _ anticipated sensitivity _ of an instrument to a signal : _",
    "i.e. , _ how precisely can the parameterization of a signal observed in the detector be determined .",
    "i find both exact and , in the interesting limit of a strong signal , approximate techniques for evaluating the expected precision with which an observed signal can be described . as an example , in  [ sec : bhringdown ] i apply the approximate techniques developed in  [ sec : sensitivity ] to the determination of the parameterization of the gravitational radiation from a perturbed black hole , especially the black hole mass @xmath4 and dimensionless angular momentum parameter @xmath5 . in  [ sec : discussion ] i briefly compare the methods and results of echeverria@xcite with my own .",
    "my conclusions are presented in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]",
    "in this section i consider two related problems that arise in the analysis of the output of a noisy detector : detection and measurement . the problem of detection is to determine whether or not a signal of known form ( _ i.e. , _ deterministic , though parameterized by one or several unknown parameters ) is present in the detector output .",
    "the problem of measurement is to determine the values of some or all of the unknown parameters that characterize the observed signal .",
    "note that the distinction between detection and measurement separates the determination of the presence or absence of the signal from the determination of the parameters that characterize it : detection does not address the value of the unknown parameters , and measurement presumes the signal s presence .",
    "detector noise can always conspire to appear as an example of the sought - for signal ; alternatively , noise can mask the presence of a signal . in either case ,",
    "noise interferes with our ability to determine the presence of the signal or the parameters that characterize it .",
    "consequently , any claim of detection must be associated with a _ probability _ signifying the degree of certainty that the detected signal is not , in fact , an instance of noise .",
    "similarly , when an observed signal is characterized it is appropriate to specify both a _ range _ of parameters and a _ probability _ that the signal parameters are in the given range .",
    "for example , i can examine the data stream from a gravitational radiation detector to determine ( with some probability ) whether the radiation from the @xmath6 mode of a perturbed , rotating black hole is present , irrespective of the black hole mass , angular momentum , or orientation with respect to the detector . if i conclude that a signal is present in the data stream , then i can attempt to determine bounds on some or all of these parameters , such that i expect the actual parameters characterizing the signal to fall within those bounds with a given probability .    in the next several subsections",
    "i examine detection and measurement in more detail .",
    "i assume that the statistical properties of the detector noise are known , and also that the _ form _ of the sought - for signal is known up to one or several parameters .",
    "my discussion focuses on determining the probability that a signal of known form is present in the output of a noisy detector , and on determining the probability that the unknown parameters have particular values .",
    "while the discussion in  [ sec : bhringdown ] is framed in the context of the measurement of gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources , the questions addressed in this ( and the following ) section are purely statistical ones and contain nothing that is specific to gravitational radiation , general relativity , or any particular physical system or theory . for more details ,",
    "the reader may consult wainstein & zubakov@xcite .",
    "consider a data stream @xmath7 which represents the output of a detector .",
    "the data stream has a noise component @xmath8 and in addition may have a signal component @xmath9 .",
    "the signal component is parameterized by several unknown parameters ( denoted collectively as @xmath0 , and individually as @xmath10 ) ; hence @xmath11 assume that @xmath0 is continuous , not discrete .",

    "aside from @xmath24 , @xmath14 depends only on the ratio of the _ a  priori _ probabilities @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in turn , the likelihood ratio depends on two components : the _ a  priori _ probability density @xmath27 and the ratio @xmath28/p(g|0)$ ] .    in order to determine @xmath14 we must _ assess _ the _ a  priori _  probabilities and _ calculate _ the likelihood ratio .",
    "it is often the case that we know , or can make an educated guess regarding , the",

    "for example , the sources may be poisson distributed in time [ determining @xmath25 and @xmath26 ] , and they may be homogeneously distributed in space [ determining @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the distance to the source ] . at other times",
    "our assessment may be more subjective or based on imperfect knowledge , and in this case we can use the observed distribution of @xmath0 to test the validity of our assessments using the techniques of hypothesis testing ( winkler@xcite  7 ) .    now turn to the evaluation of @xmath28/p(g|0)$ ] .",
    "to determine this ratio , first note that the conditional probability of measuring @xmath7 if the particular signal @xmath12 is present is the same as the conditional probability of measuring @xmath32 , assuming that the signal @xmath12 is _ not present _ in @xmath33 : @xmath34 = p[g - m(\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\mu$})|0].\\ ] ] consequently , we can focus on the conditional probability of measuring a data stream @xmath7 under the assumption that no signal is present [ @xmath35 .    in the absence of the signal ,",

    "often we know , or can make an educated guess regarding , the _",

    "finally we establish a threshold for @xmath14 [ or , equivalently , for @xmath24 , @xmath63 , or some other surrogate of @xmath14 ] , and say that if the @xmath14 ( or its surrogate ) exceeds the threshold then we have detected the signal .",
    "i will not discuss detection further , except to say that the choice of threshold is influenced by our strategy to minimize errors .",
    "the two kinds of errors we can make are to claim the presence of a signal when one is in fact not present ( a `` false alarm '' ) , or to dismiss an observed @xmath7 as noise when a signal is present ( a `` false dismissal '' ) . in order to minimize the probability of a false alarm ( conventionally denoted @xmath65 ) we want a large threshold , while to minimize the probability of a false dismissal ( conventionally denoted @xmath66 ) we want a small threshold .",
    "one obvious strategy for choosing the threshold is to minimize the sum @xmath67 , _",

    "this prior knowledge plays an important role when the distribution of the @xmath93 is not uniform or the snr is small .    on the other hand , the maximum likelihood analysis described in  [ sec : detection - and - measurement ] is applicable for all snr ( though the approximate techniques discussed at the end of  [ sec : sensitivity ]",

    "in the analysis of the results of an observation made in a detector , it is useful to distinguish between _ detection _ and _ measurement . _",
    "the analysis involved in detection refers only to the presence or absence of a signal characterizing a particular _ class _ of sources to which the detector is sensitive ( _ e.g. , _ perturbed black holes ) .",
    "a particular source of this class is described by a set of parameters : _",
    "e.g. , _ among the parameters describing the signal from a perturbed black hole is the black hole mass and angular momentum .",
    "detection addresses only whether a signal of this class is present in the observed output of the detector , and not the particular values of the parameters that best describe the signal .",
    "measurement follows detection : it refers to the determination of the values of the parameters that best characterize the particular signal _ assumed to be present in the detector output _ ( it only makes sense to speak of measuring the parameters of a real signal ) .",
    "for example , once we have concluded that we have _ detected _ the signal from the formation of a black hole , then we can go on to _ measure _ the black hole mass and angular momentum .    in order to determine whether the observed output of a detector includes a signal from a given class of sources , we saw how to calculate the probability that the detector output is consistent with the presence of the signal . that probability depends on the characteristics of the detector noise , the observed detector output , and a parameterized model of the detector response to the signal .",
    "in addition , it depends on several _ a  priori _ probabilities that must be assessed .",
    "when the calculated probability exceeds a certain threshold then we say that the we have detected a signal . setting the threshold requires careful consideration of the relative severity of falsely claiming a detection and incorrectly rejecting a signal .",
    "to determine the values of the parameters that characterize the detected signal , we saw how to construct the probability distribution that describes how likely different parameterizations @xmath0 are .",
    "we identified @xmath73 as the mode of the distribution , _",
    "i.e. , _ the parameterization that maximized the probability density , or the _ most likely _ parameterization . owing to detector noise , @xmath73 differs in a random fashion from the unknown @xmath77 that actually describes the signal .",
    "we characterized our uncertainty over the actual description of the signal by specifying a volume @xmath1 in the parameter phase space , centered on @xmath73 , such that the @xmath84 with probability @xmath3 .",
    "we then proceeded to exploit these techniques to _ anticipate _ the precision with which the parameterization of a particular signal can be determined by a given detector : _ i.e. , _ we evaluated the _ sensitivity _ of the detector to the signal from a class of sources .",
    "to do so , we found the probability distribution of @xmath231 and defined volumes @xmath1 in phase space such that @xmath84 with probability @xmath3 .",
    "these volumes determine the precision with which we _ expect _ we can determine the signal parameters in a real observation .",
    "in the interesting limit of a strong signal the anticipated probability distribution of @xmath231 for fixed @xmath73 is close to gaussian and the associated volumes @xmath1 are ellipsoids . in this limit",
    "we found approximate techniques for determining the size and orientation of this ellipsoid .",
    "both the exact and approximate expressions developed provide a powerful means of studying the sensitivity of a proposed detector or detector configuration to a source of gravitational radiation .",
    "these techniques are currently being employed to study the sensitivity of the ligo detectors to binary coalescence@xcite , precessing axisymmetric neutron stars@xcite , and non - axisymmetric neutron stars@xcite .    as an example of the process of measurement",
    ", we evaluated the variance in the mass and angular momentum of a perturbed black hole as determined by observations in a gravitational wave detector .",
    "these results improve upon those found earlier ( _ cf . _",
    "echeverria @xcite ) , and we discussed the origin of the differences .",
