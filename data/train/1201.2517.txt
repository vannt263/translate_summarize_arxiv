    "the dc contributions will however vary between the two .",
    "superconducting phase shifts associated with the junction in line with the direction of oscillations govern the force term and can be manipulated to shift the potential well bottoms away from the rigid sc lead .",
    "the phase shift associated with the second junction controls the linear and cubic term and a sweep through 0 to @xmath125 reveal that single well solutions are obtained at low phase shifts while larger values produce a double well potential if the mechanical spring constant is chosen properly .    at nonzero bias voltage",
    "we find three domains of solutions to the island equation of motion with their own characteristics .",
    "for very low bias voltage , such that the josephson frequency is low compared to the vibration frequency , the island motion is quasi periodic which distorts the tunneling current by superimposing small ripples on the current . in the intermediate voltage span ,",
    "where the josephson and island frequencies are of the same order , the system turns chaotic and the tunneling current gets irregular distortions . for larger voltages , such that the josephson frequency is much larger than the vibration frequency , the island motion is again quasi - periodic .",
    "the current is roughly harmonic , however , with a slow modulation superimposed arising from the mechanical motion of the island .",
    "the present study is based on theoretical assumption that should be within the realms of the state - of - the - art experimental capabilities .",
    "detection of chaotic dynamics in nanoscale systems would be interesting from many perspectives and it is with great confidence we anticipate experimental verification of our proposal .",

    "<S> we consider the motion of and josephson current through a mechanically oscillating superconducting island asymmetrically embedded in a josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> the electromechanical coupling is provided by distance dependent tunneling rates between the electrodes and the island . </S>",
    "<S> the system asymmetry , resulting from the geometrical configuration , leads , for weak coupling , to an equation of the mechanical motion that reduces to the well - known duffing equation . at zero bias voltage the island motion is determined by the homogenous duffing equation that opens up two separate regions of solutions depending on the superconducting phases . </S>",
    "<S> the island either moves under influence of an anharmonic single well potential , or is governed by a double well potential that allows for off - center oscillations . under applied bias voltage the island equation of motion turns into a modified duffing equation , with time dependent coefficients , that demonstrate both quasi periodic and chaotic behavior . </S>"
