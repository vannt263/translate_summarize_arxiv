    "since the launch of _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fermi ) _ in year 2008 , the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard it has been scanning the whole sky with unprecedented sensitivity at 0.1300  gev energy range . thus far ,",
    "more than 3000 @xmath0-ray  sources have been observed at the @xmath0-ray  energy range @xcite , and we are able to study bright sources among them in great detail . from _ fermi _  lat observations , we have learned that pulsars are the prominent @xmath0-ray  sources in our galaxy .",
    "more than 200 pulsars have been found with @xmath0-ray  emission , half of which are millisecond pulsars ( msps ; @xcite ) .",
    "emission from pulsars at the _ fermi _  lat energy range generally can be described by a power law with exponential cutoff , where the cutoff energy is in a range of 17  gev @xcite .",
    "this spectral feature , along with that of stable emission , can be used for finding good pulsar candidates among the unidentified @xmath0-ray  sources found by _",
    "fermi_.    msps are @xmath5 yr old neutron stars , having evolved from low - mass x - ray binaries by gaining sufficient angular momentum from accretion @xcite . because of their old ages , the @xmath0-ray  msps appear to be isotropically distributed in the sky @xcite .",
    "the distribution makes them mixed with the extragalactic @xmath0-ray  sources , which include active galactic nuclei ( agn ; the major class of @xmath0-raysources in the sky ) , several other types of galaxies @xcite , and even possibly unidentified types of sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with the release of _ fermi _  lat pass 8 database in year 2015 ,",
    "the detection sensitivity has been improved significantly , particularly at the low and high end of the lat energy range .",
    "more faint sources , in addition to @xmath6 sources reported in the lat third source catalog @xcite , appear in the data analysis . for the purpose of finding candidate msps ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a fine definition for the spectral shape of @xmath0-ray  msps is needed .",
    "we therefore have conducted analysis of the lat data for 39 @xmath0-ray  msps reported in the second lat catalog of @xmath0-ray  pulsars ( hereafter 2pc ) .",
    "we have extracted their spectra in a uniform way by using the latest pass 8 database , and obtained the general spectral shape from their spectra .",
    "in addition , our analysis has revisited the @xmath410gev emission found in three msps by @xcite , and in psr j0614@xmath33329 , we have found significant upto 200  gev emission . in this paper , we report these results .",
    "lat is a @xmath0-ray imaging instrument onboard _ fermi _   that scans the whole sky every three hours and can continuously conduct long - term @xmath0-ray  observations of thousands of gev sources @xcite . in this analysis , we selected 39 of 40 msps listed in 2pc @xcite as our targets ( see table  [ tab : likelihood ] ) , while psr  j1939 + 2134 was not included because of the low detection significance for it ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the data we used for each target are the 0.1300 gev lat events in the _ fermi _ pass 8 database inside a @xmath8 region centered at a target s position .",
    "to fully study the very high - energy emission from psr j0614@xmath33329 , for the detailed data analysis for this msp , the high - energy end was extended to 500  gev .",
    "the time period of the lat data is from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 ( utc ) to 2016 - 01 - 28 00:08:16 ( utc ) .",
    "following the recommendations of the lat team , we included those events with zenith angles less than 90 degrees , which prevents the earth s limb contamination , and excluded the events with quality flags of ` bad ' . in our following analysis ,",
    "the background galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission of the spectral model gll_iem_v06.fits and the file iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt , respectively , were used .",
    "the normalizations of the diffuse components in the analysis were always set as free parameters .",
    "for each of the msp targets , we included all sources within 20 degrees centered at their positions to make the source models based on the _ fermi _ lat 4-yr catalog @xcite .",
    "the spectral forms of these sources are provided in the catalog .",
    "spectral parameters of the sources within 5 degrees from each target were set as free parameters , and the other parameters were fixed at their catalog values .",
    "the catalog spectral models for 33 msps are an exponentially cutoff power law , @xmath9 , while for the other six msps ( j0610@xmath32100 , j1446@xmath34701 , j1747@xmath34036 , j1125@xmath35825 , j1741@xmath101351 , and j1823@xmath33021a ) are a simple power law , @xmath11 .    using the lat science tools software package v10r0p5 , we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data of the msp targets in the @xmath40.1 gev band . for psrs j1658@xmath35324 and j1858@xmath32216 , the analysis could not converge , which might be because of the relatively large uncertainties of the instrument response function of the lat in the low energy range .",
    "we thus used @xmath40.2 gev data instead for the two sources .",
    "the spectral results as well as the test statistic ( ts ) values are given in table  [ tab : likelihood ] for each source .",
    "the ts value at a given position is calculated from ts@xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the maximum likelihood values for a model without and with an additional source respectively .",
    "it is a measurement of the fit improvement for including the source , and is approximately the square of the detection significance of the source @xcite .    for the 6 msps with a power - law spectral model in the catalog",
    ", we repeated the analysis with an exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "the significance of a spectral cutoff was estimated from @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the maximum likelihood values when a target s emission was modeled with a power law with and without the cutoff respectively @xcite .",
    "we found that for the 6 pulsars , the spectral cutoff was detected with @xmath43@xmath18 significance .",
    "therefore in table  [ tab : likelihood ] , we only provide the exponentially cutoff power - law results for them .",
    "we extracted the @xmath0-ray spectra of the msp targets by performing maximum likelihood analysis to the lat data in 15 evenly divided energy bands in logarithm from 0.1300 gev . in the extraction",
    ", the spectral normalizations of the sources within 5 degrees from each target were set as free parameters , while all the other parameters of the sources were fixed at the values obtained from the above maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "the targets were considered as point sources having power - law emission with @xmath19 fixed at 2.0 .",
    "the fluxes obtained in this way are less dependent on the overall spectral model assumed for a source , providing a good description for the @xmath0-ray  emission of the source .",
    "we kept only flux data points when ts greater than 9 ( i.e. , @xmath43@xmath18 significance ) .",
    "a total of 304 data points were obtained for the 39 targets .",
    "the flux values for each target are provided in table  [ tab : point ] .",
    "we also estimated the systematic uncertainties caused by the galactic diffuse emission model used .",
    "the uncertainty in each energy band was obtained by repeating the likelihood analysis with the normalization of the diffuse component artificially fixed to the values @xmath206% deviating from the best - fit value ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties given in table  [ tab : point ] have included the systematic uncertainties .",
    "we checked the spectrum and best - fit model for each target .",
    "the spectra are well fitted by the spectral models obtained from the likelihood analysis .      in order to obtain a spectral shape",
    "that generally defines emission from msps , we first normalized the fluxes of each msp target with its 0.1300 gev energy flux ( @xmath21 in table  [ tab : likelihood ] ) .",
    "the normalized spectra of the 39 msps are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we then fit these data points with a normalized exponentially cutoff power law , i.e. , @xmath22 is obtained from @xmath19 and @xmath23 by requiring the total flux to be 1 .",
    "the best - fit values we obtained were @xmath19 = 1.5 and e@xmath24 = 3.8 gev , but with a minimum @xmath25 value of 2198 for 302 degrees of freedom .",
    "the large @xmath26 reflects the intrinsic spectral differences of the msps .",
    "we thus used a systematic uncertainty parameter to represent the intrinsic differences .",
    "the parameter was added to the uncertainties of the data points in quadrature .",
    "we found that when this parameter was set to be 0.05 , the minimum reduced @xmath26 was approximately equal to 1 . as a result , @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev",
    "were obtained , where the uncertainties are at a 3@xmath18 confidence level .",
    "this 3@xmath18 spectral region is shown as the grey area in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "in our analysis , we naturally revisited the high - energy @xmath410 gev emission from three msps found by @xcite in 2pc . in psr j0614@xmath33329 , we found a significant high - energy component and thus conducted detailed analysis of the data for this pulsar .",
    "we performed timing analysis to the 0.1500 gev lat data of the psr j0614@xmath33329  region to update the @xmath0-ray  ephemeris given in @xcite .",
    "an aperture radius of 10 was used .",
    "pulse phases for photons before mjd 55797 ( the end time of the known ephemeris ) were assigned according to the known ephemeris using the _ fermi _  plugin of tempo2 @xcite .",
    "an ` empirical fourier ' template profile was built . using this template",
    ", we generated the times of arrival ( toas ) of 40 evenly divided observations of the whole time period .",
    "both the template and toas were obtained using the maximum likelihood method described in @xcite .",
    "we used tempo2 to fit the toas .",
    "only the pulse frequency derivative @xmath27 was fitted , and the other timing parameters were fixed to their known values .",
    "we obtained @xmath28s@xmath29 , consistent with the value given in @xcite within @xmath302.2@xmath18 uncertainty .",
    "the folded pulse profile and two - dimensional phaseogram are shown in figure  [ fig : profile ] . in the following analysis",
    ", we selected phase 0.060.19 and 0.590.78 as the onpulse phase intervals , and the rest as the offpulse phase intervals .",

    "the parameter @xmath32 is a measurement of the exponential cutoff shape , where a value of 1 or @xmath331 indicates a simple exponential cutoff or a sub - exponential cutoff , respectively .",
    "we also used a simple power law in the analysis for comparison .",
    "we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data in @xmath40.1 gev energy range .",
    "we first set @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  emission during the total pulse phase intervals was detected with a ts value of 33576 , while that during the onpulse and offpulse phase intervals were detected with ts values of 37013 and 3766 , respectively .",
    "we found that during the total , onpulse , and offpulse phase intervals , the emission was better modeled with an exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "the cutoffs were significantly detected during all the three phase intervals ( @xmath35 ; estimated from @xmath15 ) .",
    "the resulting power - law fits with simple exponential cutoff are summarized in table  [ tab : likelihoods ] .",
    "we then set @xmath32 as a free parameter and repeated the binned likelihood analysis to the lat data .",
    "we found that during the total and onpulse phase intervals the sub - exponential cutoffs were detected with @xmath304@xmath18 significance ( estimated from @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the maximum likelihood value for the sub - exponentially cutoff power - law model ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting sub - exponentially cutoff power - law fits during these two phase intervals are given in table  [ tab : likelihoods ] . during the offpulse phase interval ,",
    "the sub - exponential cutoff was not detected , as the detection significance was approximately zero .",
    "we extracted the @xmath0-ray spectra of psr j0614@xmath33329  during the total , onpulse , and offpulse phase intervals , by performing maximum likelihood analysis to the lat data in 12 evenly divided energy bands in logarithm from 0.1500 gev . in the extraction ,",

    "the obtained spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectras ] , and the fluxes and ts values are provided in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "we found that while the offpulse emission was detected in an energy range of only @xmath3315 gev , the onpulse emission from the pulsar was significantly detected in a high - energy range , upto approximately 200 gev ( see table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "we performed timing analysis to the lat data of psr j0614@xmath33329  to search for @xmath0-ray  pulsations at the high - energy range , for which we selected the minimum energy as high as possible but also ensured sufficient pulsation detection significance .",
    "we found the value of 25 gev used in @xcite was proper .",
    "we first selected @xmath0-ray  photons within an aperture radius of 0.5 degrees from psr j0614@xmath33329 , approximately corresponding to the 95% contamination angle of the incoming photons from a source .",
    "a total of ten photons were collected .",

    "pulse phases for these photons were assigned and a weighted h - test value of 48 was obtained @xcite , corresponding to @xmath306@xmath18 detection significance , indicating that the @xmath0-ray  pulsation from the source was significantly detected in @xmath425 gev energy band .",
    "we plotted the weighted photons in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : profile25 ] according to their pulse phases .",
    "we also performed likelihood analysis to the @xmath425 gev data during the onpulse and offpulse phase intervals , with the emission from the source modeled with a simple power law . the @xmath0-ray  emission from psr j0614@xmath33329",
