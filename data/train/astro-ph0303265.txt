    "rx j2115 - 58 was discovered as part of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey and independently by _ euve_. further observations by schwope et al ( 1997 ) and ramsay et al ( 1999 ) showed that it was an asynchronous polar with a beat period of 6.3 days .",
    "such a short period allows us to study the effect of a changing orientation between the magnetic field and accretion stream on an easily observable timescale .",
    "the left plot in fig . 1 shows phase - folded line profiles of h@xmath0 ( top ) , and heii 4686 ( bottom ) on the nights of 2000 july 20 , 22 and 24 , evenly sampling the beat cycle ( left to right ) .",
    "these were taken using the aat rgo spectrograph .",
    "the profiles are complex , with significant changes evident over the beat cycle .",
    "an example is the enhanced heating of the secondary on the first night , evident in the strong narrow profile in the h@xmath0 line ( but not the heii 4686 ) , and the enhancement at @xmath1 on july 22 and 24 , which is manifest in a brightening of the ballistic stream in the doppler tomograms at these beat phases .",
    "the plot on the right of fig .",
    "1 shows light curves in hard x - rays from our _ xmm - newton _ observations of this system .",
    "they consist of 7 separate observations of two orbital periods , one each day , evenly sampling the beat period .",
    "they are extremely variable from night to night , but these in the hard band are not dissimilar to those seen in the _ rxte _ x - ray light curves ( ramsay et al 2000 ) .",
    "we also have uv light curves from the _ xmm optical monitor_. accretion is mainly at one pole in the lower hemisphere at beat phase 0.87 , while it is clearly also accreting at a pole in the upper hemisphere at most other phases ( for example phase 0.23 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra also change appreciably at different beat phases : one ( at beat phase 0.13 ) requires a distinct soft x - ray component while the other ( at phase 0.55 ) does not .",
    "similar behaviour is seen in our shorter xmm - newton observations of the asynchronous polar by cam ( ramsay & cropper 2002 ) .",
    "a comprehensive analysis is in progress .",
