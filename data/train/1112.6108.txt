    "ising - type models have been reviewed and used by physicists in many different areas , such as sociology , politics , marketing , and finance @xcite . in 2000 , an agent - based model proposed by sznajd - weron _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was successfully applied to the dynamics of a social system . in particular , the model reproduced certain properties observed in a real community . at the focus of the sznajd model ( sm )",
    "is the emergence of social collective ( macroscopic ) behavior due to the interactions among individuals , which constitute the microscopic level of a social system .",
    "this model has been extensively studied since the introduction of the original one - dimensional model in 2000 .",
    "modifications were proposed in many works , like the consideration of different types of lattices such as square @xcite , triangular @xcite and cubic @xcite , the increase of the range of the interaction @xcite and the number of variable s states @xcite and the possibility of diffusion of agents @xcite .",
    "the original sm consists of a chain of sites with periodic boundary conditions where each site ( individual opinion ) could have two possible states ( opinions ) represented in the model by ising spins ( `` yes '' or `` no '' ) .",
    "a pair of parallel spins on sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 forces its two neighbors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to have the same orientation ( opinion ) , while for an antiparallel pair @xmath7 , the left neighbor ( @xmath5 ) takes the opinion of the spin @xmath4 and the right neighbor ( @xmath6 ) takes the opinion of the spin @xmath3 . in this first formulation of the sm two types of steady states are always reached : complete consensus ( ferromagnetic state ) or stalemate ( anti - ferromagnetic state ) , in which every site has an opinion that is different from the opinion of its neighbors . however , the transient displays a interesting behavior , as pointed by stauffer et al . @xcite . defining the model on a square lattice ,",
    "the authors in @xcite considered not a pair of neighbors , but a @xmath8 plaquette with four neighbors .",
    "considering that each plaquette with all spins parallel can convince all their eight neighbors ( we will call this stauffer s rule ) , a phase transition was found for an initial density of up spins @xmath9 .",
    "it is more realistic to associate a probability of persuasion to each site .",
    "the sm is robust with respect to this choice : if one convinces the neighbors only with some probability @xmath10 , and leaves them unchanged with probability @xmath11 , still a consensus is reached after a long time @xcite .",
    "models that consider many different opinions ( using potts spins , for example ) or defined on small - world networks were studied in order to represent better approximations of real communities behavior ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in another work , in order to avoid full consensus in the system and makes the model more realistic , schneider introduced opportunists and persons in opposition , that are unconvinced by their neighbors @xcite .    in the real world , however , the dynamics of social relationships is more complex .",
    "even when such more structured topologies as small - world networks are adopted to bring the sm closer to reality , a large number of details is often neglected . in order to advance toward realism ,",
    "we recently considered a reputation mechanism @xcite .",
    "we believe that the reputation of agents who hold the same opinion is an important factor in opinion propagation across the community . in other words",
    ", it is realistic to believe that the individuals will change their opinions under the influence of highly respected persons .",
    "the reputation limits the agents power of persuasion , and we can expect the model in @xcite to be more realistic than the standard one @xcite .",
    "in fact , we showed that simple microscopic rules are sufficient to generate a democracy - like state , ferromagnetically ordered with only partial polarization @xcite .    in this work , we revise and extend our previous results by allowing reputations to increase and decrease , depending on whether the agents are or are not persuaded .",
    "this generalization is based on the behavior of real social networks : certain persons tend to be skeptical if the persuaders have low reputation , in which case their best strategy is to keep their opinions . in this sense",
    ", including reputation makes the sm more realistic . to be thorough",
    ", we will consider two different protocols .",
    "in the first case , the agents reputations increase for each persuaded neighbor , whereas in the second case , the agents reputations rise in case of persuasion and decrease whenever the agents fail to convince their neighbors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the model and define their microscopic rules .",
    "the numerical results as well as the finite - size scaling analysis are discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we have considered our model defined on a square lattice with @xmath12 agents and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "similar to stauffer s rule ( rule ia of @xcite ) , we choose at random a @xmath13 plaquette of four neighbors and if all central spins are parallel , the neighbors may change their opinions .",
    "the difference in our model is that the neighbor s spins will be flipped depending on the plaquette reputation .",
    "an integer number ( @xmath14 ) labels each player and represents its reputation across the community , in analogy to the naming game model considered by brigatti @xcite .",
    "the reputation is introduced as a score for each player and is time dependent .",
    "the agents start with a random distribution of @xmath14 values , and during the time evolution , the reputation of each agent changes according to its capacity of persuasion .",
    "we will consider in this work that the initial values of the agents reputation follow a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath15 with standard deviation @xmath16 .",
    "we have considered two different situations in this work : in the first case , the reputations increase following the model s rules , whereas in the second case the reputations may increase and decrease .",
    "one time step in our model is defined by the following microscopic rules : + _ case 1 _    1 .",
    "we randomly choose a 2 @xmath17 2 plaquette of four neighbors ; 2 .",
    "if not all four center spins are parallel , leaves its eight neighbors unchanged .",
    "3 .   on the other hand ,",
    "if the four center spins are fully polarized , we calculate the average reputation @xmath18 of the plaquette , @xmath19 where each term @xmath20 represents the reputation of one of plaquettes agent .",
    "we compare the reputations of each of the eight neighbors of the plaquette with the average reputation .",
    "if the reputation of a neighbor is less than the average , this neighbor follow the plaquette orientation . on the other hand , if the neighbor s reputation exceeds @xmath18 , no action is taken .",
    "5 .   for each persuasion",
    ", the reputation of the plaquette agents is incremented by 1 , so that the average plaquette reputation is increased by 1 .",
    "_ case 2 _    in this case , steps 1 - 4 are as described above .",
    "step 5 , by contrast , is changed to the following rule :    * for each persuasion , the reputation of the plaquette agents is incremented by 1 . on the other hand , for each failure , the reputations within the plaquette are decremented by 1 .",
    "thus , even in the case of fully polarized plaquettes , different numbers of agents may be convinced , namely 8 , 7 , 6 , . . .",
    ", 1 , or 0 .",
    "as pointed by stauffer in @xcite , we can imagine that each agent in the sznajd model carries an opinion that can either be up ( e.g. , republican ) or down ( e.g. , democrat ) , which represents one of two possible opinions on any question .",
    "the objective of the agents in the game is to convince their neighbors .",
    "one can expect that , if a certain group of agents convince many others , their persuasive power grows .",
    "on the other hand , the persuasive powers may drop if the agents fail to convince other individuals .",
    "the inclusion of reputation in our model captures this feature of the real world .",
    ", initial densities of up spins @xmath21 and @xmath22 and different samples ( a ) .",
    "we can see that the steady states show situations where the total consensus is not obtained , in opposition of the standard sznajd model defined on the square lattice @xcite . in figure ( b ) we show the results for @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in these cases the system reaches consensus in all samples.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ] + ,",

    "following the previous works on the sm , we can start studying the time evolution of the magnetization per site , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of agents and @xmath28 . in the standard sm defined on the square lattice @xcite , the application of the stauffer s rule , where a @xmath8 plaquette with all spins parellel",
    "convince its eigth neighbors , with initial density of up spins @xmath9 leads the system to the fixed points with all up or all down spins with equal probability . for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) the system goes to a ferromagnetic state with all spins down ( up ) in all samples , which characterizes a phase transition at @xmath9 in the limit of large @xmath31 .",
    "as pointed by the authors in @xcite , fixed points with all spins parallel describe the published opinion in a dictatorship , which is not a commom situation nowadays",
    ". however , ferromagnetism with not all spins parallel corresponds to a democracy , which is very commom in our world .",
