    ", we consider a model electrostatic free boundary problem where the interface can develop regions of extremely high curvature .",
    "we develop a matched asymptotics method for conformal maps , that completely avoids the computational difficulties associated with crowding for _ a priori unknown domains_.    an interesting interplay between interface geometry and induced stresses exists in electromechanical systems .",
    "when a conducting interface is deflected by an external field , the induced charge distribution /the local electrostatic pressure is higher in the parts of the sheet with high curvature .",
    "this in turn causes even higher deflections and sharper curvatures .",
    "this can produce extremely sharp and nearly singular shapes , as well as _ the pull - in instability _ , a runaway effect due to the positive feedback between curvature and electrostatic forces , whereby no equilibrium solutions exist beyond a critical forcing strength . for these reasons",

    "the conducting sheet is initially at @xmath8 and is subsequently pulled up by a line charge placed at @xmath9 .",
    "the restoring force from the foundation can be modelled as a linear function of the deflection from @xmath10 , and this agrees with the expression for the hydrostatic pressure on the interface in the two - fluid model , which is also a linear function of the deflection .",

    "one would like to have roughly equal number of points to resolve each of the regions with a different dominant balance .",
    "a weakness of the conformal mapping method , as described in section  [ sec : collocation ] is that it is intrinsically _",

    "contrary to our initial expectation , the breakdown of the collocation method is not due to poor resolution of the tip ; rather it is due to poor resolution of the decaying region of the interface , where the dominant  large - scale \" balance is between gravity and surface tension , and the relevant length scale for this region is the capillary length .",
    "this effect is easily understood by recognizing that the electric field on the interface is related to the inter - node separation in the physical plane since @xmath145 .",
    "since the electric field ( and the induced charge ) concentrates near sharp tips , the nodes in the physical plane will concentrate near sharp tips .",

    "it has been recognized as a substantial impediment to using numerical methods to find conformal maps for regions that have multiple length - scales / singularities in their boundary @xcite .",
    "this is not a peculiarity of the conformal mapping based method : alternative methods that we could have applied , including boundary element methods based on the boundary integral formulations , or direct minimization of the total system energy , must all be adapted to deal with the disparate length scales that characterize stiff problems .",

    "this motivates the definition @xmath146 , as the relevant small parameter that defines this asymptotic regime .",
    "when @xmath147 is small , we expect that the tip is sharp and the total charge @xmath148 induced on the sheet accumulates ( and hence , image nodes crowd ) near the high - curvature sheet tip .    as @xmath149",
    ", all the charge concentrates on the tip , so to leading order in @xmath147 , we can model the charge on the interface as a concentrated charge @xmath148 at the tip @xmath150 .",

    "the scheme modifies leading order large deflection profiles with a more subtle description of the true tip shape .",
    "we adopt the usual notation of matched asymptotics from this point forward , labeling the conformal maps that describe leading order large deflection profiles ` outer ' solutions , and the conformal maps that represent the sheet tip profile ` inner ' solutions .",
    "we remark that rather than just the solution profile @xmath193 ( see ) we need an appropriate conformal parameterization @xmath194 for the outer region .",
    "the use of conformal maps to represent both inner and outer solutions is essential for maintaining the fundamental relationship between global sheet geometry and electric field that characterizes this problem , _",

    "<S> we use conformal maps to study a free boundary problem for a two - fluid electromechanical system , where the interface between the fluids is determined by the combined effects of electrostatic forces , gravity and surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> the free boundary in our system develops sharp corners / singularities in certain parameter regimes , and this is an impediment to using existing  single - scale \" numerical conformal mapping methods . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty is due to the phenomenon of crowding , i.e. the tendency of nodes in the preimage plane to concentrate near the sharp regions of the boundary , leaving the smooth regions of the boundary poorly resolved . </S>",
    "<S> a natural idea is to exploit the scale separation between the sharp regions and smooth regions to solve for each region separately , and then stitch the solutions together . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not straightforward as conformal maps are rigid  global \" objects , and it is not obvious how one would patch two conformal maps together to obtain a new conformal map . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a  multi - scale \" ( i.e. adaptive ) conformal mapping method that allows us to carry out this program of stitching conformal maps on different scales together . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully apply our method to the electromechanical model problem and discuss how it generalizes to other situations . </S>"
