    "the structure of the nodal set of wave functions reflects the type of the underlying classical flow .",

    "this was followed by several other studies of nodal statistics @xcite , and their relation to the random waves ensemble @xcite .",
    "quantum graphs are excellent paradigms of quantum chaos @xcite , and in the present work we try to check to what extent the statistics of nodal domains in graphs follow the patterns observed in the study of wave functions of the schrdinger operators in the typical systems ( eg , billiards ) where quantum chaos is often discussed .",
    "graphs are one dimensional systems .",
    "their complex features stem from two facts : _",
    "i. _ their topology is different from a one - dimensional interval ( except for starlike graphs they are generally not simply connected ) , _ ii . _",
    "the corresponding `` classical '' dynamics is not deterministic . because of the different topology , sturm s oscillation theorem @xcite does not apply for graphs .",
    "we shall show however , that courant s generalization of the oscillation theorem @xcite to higher dimensions applies , but much more can be said about the problem .",
    "that is , the number of nodal domains of the @xmath1th eigenfunction is generically bounded between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and an explicit expression for @xmath2 will be given .",
    "the rest of this section will be devoted to the introduction of metric graphs and the corresponding schrdinger operator .",
    "the nodal counting problem will be defined in section [ general ] and some general results will be presented .",
    "the distribution of the number of nodal domains will be discussed in section [ statistics ] .",
    "this distribution will be calculated for _ star graphs _ in section [ star ] , and the results of these computations will be used to derive the asymptotic distribution of the number of nodal domains in the limit of large graphs . some results on counting domains on a bond in starlike graphs will be presented in section [ starlike ] . finally , in section [ random ] we shall introduce the random wave model for graphs . the mean and variance of the distribution of the number of nodal domains",

    "one can not exclude the possibility that eigenfunctions of the schrdinger operator vanish identically on one or several bonds .",

    "to exclude such cases , we shall discuss graphs with lengths which are _ rationally independent ( incommensurate)_.    rational independence is not sufficient to remove completely the possibility that wave functions vanish along one or several bonds . to construct an example ,",

    "connect the nodal points by bonds and take their length such that the new graph has incommensurate lengths .",
    "the schrdinger operator for the newly constructed graph has the same eigenvalue , and a wave function which vanishes identically on all the added bonds .",
    "this construction is quite general , but at most , it can bring about a negligible number of such wave functions .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "the @xmath1th wave function on the bond @xmath14 $ ] vanishes if and only if both @xmath58 and @xmath59 vanish .",
    "the vectors @xmath60 are the null vector of the _ quasi - periodic _ matrix @xmath61 , and as @xmath62 goes over the spectrum , they cover the sphere ergodically .",
    "thus , the probability that several components are exactly @xmath37 is vanishingly small . in the sequel we shall ignore these non - generic cases , but bear in mind , however , that their presence can not be completely excluded .",
    "the nodal domains on graphs are divided into two types :    _ i. interior domain _ - a domain which is restricted to a single bond , and whose length is exactly @xmath63 .",
    "vertex domain _ - a domain which includes a vertex , and extends to the bonds which emanate from it .",
    "there are @xmath4 vertex domains , and their length @xmath64 can take any value in the range @xmath65 . denoting the length of the graph by @xmath66 , we obtain the following expression for the number of nodal domains , @xmath67 note that the second term above is an integer , and that this expression is correct for the generic case where the wave - function does not vanish along entire bonds .",

    "an alternative expression for the number of nodal domains provides a sharper bound on the range of variation of @xmath68 .",

    "the ensemble of random waves on a graph is therefore defined in terms of the probability distribution of the @xmath214 .",
    "before we define the appropriate ensemble for more general graphs it will be instructive to discuss star graphs .",
    "if we want to compare random waves with the star graph results of the previous chapter we have to keep the dirichlet boundary conditions at the peripheral vertices and only relax the the current conservation condition at the center .",
    "then @xmath215 is the random wave on the @xmath11th bond and @xmath152 is the only random parameter for fixed @xmath51 .",
    "obviously the position of nodal points does not depend on @xmath152 .",

    "note , that for incommensurate bond lengths there are no correlations between the contributions from single bonds .",
    "thus the number of nodal domains is a sum of independent quantities of finite variance each .",
    "the central limit theorem leads to gaussian statistics for large @xmath0 .    to define an appropriate ensemble for more general graphs",
    "we will be guided by wave functions that _ do _ fulfill current conservation ( we will again assume that each vertex has a valence @xmath220 ) .",
    "the quantization condition for a graph has the form @xmath221 where @xmath222 is a real symmetric matrix of dimension @xmath223 @xcite .",
    "if the quantization condition is fulfilled for @xmath51 , the eigenvector for the zero eigenvalue is a set of vertex values @xmath212 that determines the eigenfunction . for incommensurate lengths",
    "@xmath222 is a quasi - periodic function of @xmath51 such that the matrices @xmath222 are expected to be typical members of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) in random - matrix theory . since for that ensemble eigenvectors",

    "the sum over sines and the sum over the signs @xmath230 give independent contributions to the variance .",
    "we have already calculated the first part @xmath231 above in our discussion of random waves on star graphs .",
    "the fluctuations due to the signs are stronger , and they provide to the variance a term @xmath232 .",
    "hence the random wave model predicts the variance @xmath233 this result reproduces the estimate ( [ eq : varnu ] ) , which was derived under very different assumptions .",
