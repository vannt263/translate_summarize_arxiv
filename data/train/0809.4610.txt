    "complex dynamical systems can be adequately represented by networks with a diversity of structural and dynamical characteristics , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "often such networks appear to have multiscale structure with subgraphs of different sizes and topological consistency .",
    "some well known examples include gene modules on genetic networks @xcite , social community structures @xcite , topological clusters @xcite or dynamical aggregation on the internet , to mention only a few .",
    "it has been understood that in the evolving networks some functional units may have emerged as modules or communities , that can be topologically recognized by better or tighter connections .",
    "finding such substructures is therefore of great importance primarily for understanding network s evolution and function .    in",
    "recent years great attention has been devoted to the problem of community structure in social and other networks , where the community is topologically defined as a subgraph of nodes with better connection among the members compared with the connections between the subgraphs , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "variety of algorithms have been developed and tested , a comparative analysis of many such algorithms can be found in @xcite . mostly such algorithms",
    "are based on the theorem of maximal - flow  minimal - cut @xcite , where naturally , maximum topological flow falls on the links between the communities .",
    "recently a new approach was proposed based on the _ maximum - likelihood _ method , @xcite . in maximization likelihood method an assumed _ mixture model _",
    "is fit to a given data set . assuming that the network nodes can be split into @xmath1 groups , where group memberships are unknown , then the expectation - maximization algorithm is used in order to find maximum of the likelihood that suites the model . as a result",
    "a set of probabilities that a node belongs to a certain group are obtained .",
    "the probabilities corresponding to global maximum of the likelihood are expected to give the best split of the network into given number of groups .    in complex dynamical networks ,",
    "however , other types of substructures may occur , that are not necessarily related to `` better connectivity '' measure . generally , the substructures may be differentiable with respect certain functional ( dynamical ) constraints , such as limited path length ( or cost ) , weighted subgraphs , or subgraphs that are synchronizable at a given time scale .",
    "search for such types of substructures may require new algorithms adapted to the respective dynamical constraints .",
    "in this work we adapt the maximum - likelihood methods to study subgraphs with weighted links in real and computer - generated networks .",
    "we first introduce a new model to generate a network - of - networks with a controlled subgraph structure and implement the algorithm , @xcite , to test its limits and ability to find the _ a priori _ known substructures .",
    "we then generalize the algorithm to incorporate the weights on the links and apply it to find the weighted subgraphs on a almost fully connected random graph with known weighted subgraphs and on a real - data network of yeast gene - expression correlations .",
    "we introduce an algorithm for network growth with a controlled modularity . as a basis ,",
    "we use the model with preferential attachment and preferential rewiring , @xcite , which captures the statistical features of the world wide web . two parameters @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 control the emergent structure of the webgraph when the average number of links per node @xmath4 is fixed .",
    "for instance , for @xmath5 : when @xmath6 the emergent structure is a scale - free clustered and correlated network , in particular the case @xmath7 corresponds to the properties measured in the www @xcite ; when @xmath8 a scale - free tree structure emerges with the exponents depending on the parameter @xmath3 . here",
    "we generalize the model in a nontrivial manner to permit development of distinct subnetworks or modules .",
    "the number of different groups of nodes is controlled by additional parameter @xmath9 .",
    "each subgroup evolves according to the rules of webgraph .    at each time step @xmath10",
    "we add a new node @xmath11 and @xmath4 new links . with probability",
    "@xmath9 a new group is started .",
    "the added node is assigned current group index .",
    "( first node belong to the first group . )",
    "the group index plays a crucial role in linking the node to the rest of the network .",
    "the links are created by attaching the added node inside the group , with probability @xmath2 , or else rewiring within the entire network .",
    "the target node _ k _ is selected preferentially with respect to the current situation in the group , which determines the linking probability @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , the node which rewires the link _ n _ is selected according to its current number of outgoing links , which determines the probability @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are in- or out - degrees of respective nodes at time step @xmath10 , @xmath17 is number of links in whole network , while @xmath18 is number of link between nodes in a group of node @xmath19 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath20=@xmath21 . suggested rules of linking insure existence of modules in the network .",
    "each group has a central node , hub , in terms of in - degree connectivity , and a set of nodes along which it is connected with the other groups .",
    "the number of groups @xmath1 in the network depends on number of nodes , _",
    "n _ , and the parameter _",
    "@xmath9 _ as @xmath22 .",
    "some emergent modular structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - graphs - clusters ] . for the purpose of this work",
    "we only mention that the networks grown using the above rules are scale - free with both in - coming and out - going links distributed as ( @xmath23=``in '' or `` out '' ) : @xmath24 the scaling exponents @xmath25 and @xmath26 vary with the parameters @xmath3 and _ @xmath9_. in fig .  [ fig - pq ]",
    "we show cumulative distribution of in- and out - links in the case n=25000 nodes , m=5 , @xmath27 and number of groups @xmath28 .",
    "the slopes are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have extended the maximum - likelihood - method of community analysis to incorporate multigraphs ( wmlm ) and analysed several types of networks with mesoscopic inhomogeneity .",
    "our results show that the extended wmlm can be efficiently applied to search for variety of subgraphs from a clear topological inhomogeneity with network - of - networks structure , on one end , to hidden subgraphs of node with the same strength on the other .",
