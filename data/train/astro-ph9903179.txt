    "in models of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering , the disks of spiral galaxies form by late accretion of gas which cools from an extended reservoir around the galaxy . in these models disks",
    "are still expected to be growing at the present day .",
    "such models have been very successful in accounting for properties of galaxies at optical and infrared wavelengths ( see , for example , kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 , cole et al .",
    "1994 , baugh , cole & frenk 1996 , kauffmann et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the proposed disk formation mechanism should produce a signature at x - ray wavelengths which , in principle , is detectable with the present generation of satellites .    at the virial temperature of galaxy halos , the dominant cooling mechanism is x - ray bremsstrahlung .",
    "if the cooling rate is significant , this flux may be visible as a component of diffuse x - ray emission extending well beyond the galaxy s optical radius . in this paper",
    ", we set out to test this disk formation model by looking for x - ray emission from the hypothesized reservoir of cooling gas around three large , late - type galaxies , ngc  2841 , ngc  4594 and ngc  5529 .",
    "if we assume that the mass of the present disk has been built up by a constant rate of accretion over the age of the universe ( @xmath2 ) , a simple estimate of the x - ray luminosity can be made from the binding energy of the disk .",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the present mass of the disk , @xmath5 ^{1/2}$ ] is the velocity required by material at the edge of the disk to escape the halo ( assuming a flat rotation curve ) and @xmath6 is the measured circular velocity of the disk . adopting parameters suitable for a large spiral galaxy such as ngc  2841 ( ie . , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 )",
    ", this suggests that the halo should emit a bolometric luminosity of at least @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "if supernovae and other feedback processes are effective in heating halo gas then even more energy must be radiated to assemble the observed disk .",
    "note that eqn .",
    "( [ eq : be ] ) predicts a minimum @xmath14 , and that the temperature of the cooling gas should scale as the halo virial temperature , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , it is important to search for emission in the most massive systems available .    the picture of hierarchical galaxy formation developed by white & frenk ( 1991 , wf91 ;",
    "see also kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 , cole et al . , 1994 ) predicts halo x - ray luminosities more directly by computing the cooling rate of gas as a function of time . at the present epoch ,",
    "such models ( which are tuned to reproduce the observed optical properties of galaxies ) predict an x - ray luminosity of about @xmath16 for galaxies like ngc  2841 .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have searched for large - scale diffuse x - ray emission from three nearby , high rotation velocity spiral galaxies . in each case , we find that the observed emission is almost _ an order of magnitude _ below that required to build the disk at a constant rate within the age of the universe .",
    "the accretion rate is similarly discordant with theoretical estimates of the cooling rate of gas in an isothermal or nfw - profile halo .",
    "although extremely suggestive , our results are not definitive .",
    "the reasons for this are :    * strong constraints are derived only for the two nearer galaxies .",
    "we may , by chance , have selected two systems that have anomalous cooling rates .",
    "this is plausible for the bulge dominated ngc  4594 galaxy ( ` the sombrero ' ) .",
    "ngc  2841 appears to be more typical of spiral galaxies , but its proximity makes accurate background subtraction difficult , and our results are dependent on the profile assumed for the x - ray emission .",
    "by contrast , the third galaxy meeting our selection criteria is too distant for strong limits on the x - ray flux to be set .",
    "we note , however , that the x - ray limits established for these galaxies are compatible with the emission that is thought to occur in the halo of our own galaxy ( eg .",
    ", moore & davis , 1994 , wolfire , et al .",
    "* there are a number of parameters that have been assumed in order to predict the x - ray flux from the properties of the halo .",
    "no parameter , or combination of parameters , can simultaneously give a low x - ray luminosity and build the observed disk . to reconcile the predictions with the observed luminosities we must assume that either : ( a ) disks were built at high redshift ; or , ( b ) accretion onto disks occurs without radiating the binding energy of the gas at x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. in a multiphase flow ) .",
    "our results encourage further work .",
    "the current upper limits are set by our ability to subtract the background count - rate in the images .",
    "this is exacerbated in the rosat data because the flux level at which individual point sources may be subtracted varies across the image on scales comparable to the spiral galaxy haloes .",
    "future work requires large - scale imaging with a detector that has a near - uniform detection threshold , such as the epic camera aboard the xmm satellite ( lumb et al .",
    "such a survey would need to target a greater fraction of the nearby galaxies , setting firmer limits on the diffuse x - ray emission and eliminating variations in galaxy properties as a major source of uncertainty .",
    "if such work continues to fail to make detections , then we may be forced to conclude that spiral disks are no longer growing at the present epoch .",
    "this would agree with traditional models of galaxy formation in which galaxies accrete their mass at early times and evolve as more or less closed systems to the present - day .",
    "clearly , there is much to learn from future studies of the x - ray haloes of spiral galaxies .",

    "following wf91 , we assume that cooling occurs within a static potential , and that the cooling gas remains isothermal as it flows to the centre .",
    "the assumption of isothermality allows considerable simplification in the determination of the x - ray luminosity of the flow since it is directly related to the drop in potential energy ( ie . , the internal energy of the gas remains constant ) .",

    "( 1999 ) , show that these assumptions are reasonable over the range of scales over which we wish to determine the flow solution .",

    "( 1993 ) and cole et al .",
    "( 1994 ) gas is assumed to flow from the cooling radius towards the centre of the halo .",
    "no mass is assumed to fall out of the flow until it reaches the central galaxy .",
    "we find the total energy emitted by unit mass of gas as it flows inwards and then integrate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 to find the total energy emitted by the mass of gas ,      if we now make the assumption that mass flows to the centre more quickly than the structure of the flow changes , then the structure of the flow at a snapshot in time can be represented by the trajectory of a single mass unit .",
    "hence      below we consider two possibilities for the structure of the dark matter halo . in  [ isocoolsec ] we consider an isothermal halo and in  [ nfwcool ] we consider the dark matter profile described by nfw , in each case assuming that the gas initially traces the dark matter .",
    "this potential was considered by wf91 .",
    "the dark matter density profile is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is radial distance in the halo .",
    "the cooling radius , @xmath19 , in the halo is defined as the radius at which the cooling time , @xmath25 , of the gas equals the age of the universe , @xmath2 .",
    "ideally , we would use the time since the halo last doubled in mass ( cole & lacey , 1993 ) , but this information is not available for an individual galaxy .",
    "since mass cooling rates decline with time , this leads to a conservative comparison with our observational results .",
    "( white & frenk 1991 ) , where @xmath27 is the baryon fraction , @xmath28 is the cooling function of the gas , @xmath29 is the fraction of the initial baryon density remaining in gaseous form ( which we normally assume to be 1 ) , @xmath30 is the gravitational constant , @xmath31 is the mass of a proton , @xmath32 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , @xmath6 is the circular velocity of the halo and @xmath33 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "nfw provide a fitting formula for the density profiles of dark matter haloes in n - body simulations of hierarchical clustering .",

    "this formula provides a good approximation to the density profile of haloes of all masses over at least two orders of magnitude in radius and its shape is independent of the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "appropriate parameters for the galaxy haloes in any given cosmology are determined by requiring that the measured circular velocity of the galaxy corresponds to the maximum in the nfw rotation curve .",
