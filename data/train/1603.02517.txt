    "in recent years , the unconventional superconductivity found in iron - based superconductors(ibscs ) has attracted much attention in condensed matter community . due to the proximity of superconductivity and the collinear spin density wave(sdw ) phase",
    ", it is generally believed that there exists an intrinsic link between the magnetic fluctuations and the superconductivity .",
    "thus , the understanding of the normal state magnetic fluctuations will be helpful to identify the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "experimentally , it was found that the sdw transition is either preemptive by or coincident with a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic(to ) structural transition at @xmath1@xcite which signals the @xmath2 symmetry breaking above the sdw transition temperarture @xmath3 .",
    "such a @xmath2 symmetry breaking phase is called the nematic phase in literatures@xcite .",
    "further studies show that the nematicity persists to @xmath4 above @xmath1@xcite .",
    "so far , there is clear evidence that nematicity comes from the electronic rather than the lattice degree of freedom@xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to identify the fingerprint of nematicity due to the coupling of various electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "experimentally , it was found that the presence of nematicity is accompanied by anisotropic magnetic correlations which indicates its magnetic origination@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it was also found that the characteristic temperature @xmath4 of nematicity coincides with that of the orbital order@xcite , which indicates that nematicity is orbitally driven .",
    "so , the origin of nematicity is still debated , both the magnetic and orbital fluctuations are proposed to be responsible for the emergence of nematicity@xcite . thus , the study of the origin of nematicity is highly desired as it may shed light on the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in ibscs .",
    "one of the effective ways to distinguish between different scenarios of nematicity is to compare the theoretical results of each scenario to the experimental observations . in this regard",
    ", we notice that the electronic structure can be mapped effectively through the analysis of the quasiparticle scattering interference ( qpi ) patterns@xcite and the spatial modulation of the electronic states resulting from qpi can be probed directly by the stm experiments . in fact , the recent stm experiments@xcite for nafeas have been performed to investigate the electronic structure in the nematic phase in ibscs .",
    "the stm experiments@xcite reveal that the qpi patterns exhibit highly anisotropic dimer structure deep in the sdw phase .",
    "it was further found that the anisotropic features persist to high temperatures above @xmath1 , but the anisotropy weakens gradually with the increase of temperature .",
    "therefore , the qpi may offer a playground for the test of the origin of nematicity .    in this paper",
    ", we study theoretically the quasiparticle interference induced by impurity in the nematic phase based on the magnetic and orbital scenarios of nematicity , respectively .",
    "deep in the collinear @xmath5 sdw state , the low energy qpi patterns exhibit a dimer structure with its orientation along the ferromagnetic direction of the sdw state .",
    "this is due to the fully opening of the sdw gap along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "when the energy is increased to be slightly below the fermi level , it is composed of two sets of dimers along the same direction . in this case , the qpi reflects the topology of the distorted fermi surface and the two sets of dimers come from the inter - hole - pocket and intra - hole - pocket scatterings .",
    "it is further shown that the above features of the qpi patterns remain in the magnetically driven nematic phase , which is modelled by the fluctuating short - range antiferromagnetic order . in the orbital scenario of nematicity",
    ", it is found that the scatterings of quasiparticles between dirac cones dominate the qpi process . due to the inequivalent energy positions of the two dirac cones resulting from the @xmath2 symmetry breaking induced by the orbital order , the dimer structure in the qpi patterns undergoes a @xmath0 rotation with increasing energy .",
    "the transition is irrespective of the momentum dependence of the orbital order , so long as the energy splitting between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands is fixed near the dirac cones .",
    "we propose that these results can be used to distinguish the origin of the nematicity in various iron - based compounds .    as a preliminary comparison to available experiments",
    ", we note that the obtained anisotropic features of the scattering patterns and the orientation of the dimer in the magnetic scenario are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations on nafeas@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian we use to carry out the calculations can be divided into three parts : the tight binding part , the impurity part and that modelling the nematicity .",
    "we adopt the five - orbital tight binding hamiltonian of ref@xcite which reproduces the lda energy bands .",
    "the tight binding hamiltonian reads @xmath9 . where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the orbital and spin indices , respectively .",
    "the tight binding hopping parameters for @xmath12 are given in ref@xcite and the energy unit ev will be used throughout the paper . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the qpi phenomenon induced by impurity potential scattering . the impurity hamiltonian can be written as @xmath13 .",
    "for simplicity , we adopt a @xmath14-function type scattering potential which resides on the given lattice site @xmath15 .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath16 is orbital diagonal and momentum independent . in this paper ,",
    "the average electron occupation number is fixed to be @xmath17 per unit cell which corresponds to the undoped parent compound .      in order to model the sdw and the magnetically driven nematic phase , we include the coulomb interaction hamiltonian .",

    "the results for the magnetic moments are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . in eq.(2 ) , we have ignored the orbital off - diagonal magnetic terms .",

    "therefore , the magnetically driven nematicity where the long - range sdw order is absent but the c@xmath57 symmetry is broken by magnetic fluctuations has been proposed@xcite .",
    "this phase is modelled by the short - range antiferromagnetic correlation , which is approximated by the lee - rice - anderson formula@xcite . in this way",

    "@xmath62 is a lorentzian which represents the @xmath63 modulated magnetic correlation with @xmath64 the correlation length and @xmath63 the momenta derivation from @xmath5 .",
    "the orbital diagonal @xmath65 is the order parameter matrix of the fluctuating magnetic order .",
    "the elements of @xmath65 read as @xmath66 and @xmath67@xmath68 .",

    "the orbital orders are used to model the orbitally driven nematicity as used before@xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath71 is determined by the arpes data .",
    "thus , the full hamiltonian reads @xmath72 for the orbital scenario of nematicity in the presence of the impurity scattering .",
    "both the momentum dependent and the momentum independent orbital orders will be considered in the following .    with the hamiltonians shown above , we can now construct the corresponding green s functions .",
    "for the orbital scenario of nematicity , the green s function can be defined in the orbital basis as @xmath73 which can be obtained directly from @xmath74 .",
    "the quasiparticle interference occurs between the ingoing and scattered outgoing electrons by impurity .",
    "the resulting spatial modulation of the electronic states can be visualized directly by the stm experiments@xcite . after a fourier transformation",
    ", one can get its manifestation in the momentum space , i.e. , the density of states in the momentum space @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the features of the qpi patterns can be qualitatively understood by the analysis of the joint density of states of the initial and final states .",
    "theoretically , @xmath75 is expressed as @xmath76 , where the @xmath54 matrix reads @xmath77 . in each scenario ,",
    "the corresponding green s function @xmath78 is used to calculate @xmath75 .",
    "a born limited scattering potential of @xmath79 is adopted . in this case , the qpi patterns are not disturbed by the impurity resonance states , thus they are directly related to the underlying bands structure .",
    "let us start with the discussion of the distortion in the energy bands due to the collinear @xmath5 sdw order with its moment antiferromagnetically aligning along the @xmath36 direction but ferromagnetically along the @xmath80 direction . in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] , we show the normal state fermi surface ( fs ) and the resulted fs after the introduction of the sdw order . clearly , the normal state hole fs around @xmath81 develops into three distinct hole pockets @xmath82 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the presence of the sdw order which induces the hybridization between the hole pockets around @xmath82 and the electron pocket around @xmath83 . as revealed by previous study@xcite , the two small hole pockets @xmath55 and @xmath56 exhibit dirac cone like dispersions .",
    "these dirac cone dispersions persist even when the off - diagonal sdw orders are taken into account .",
    "the sdw distorted fss calculated here are in qualitative agreement with the arpes observations@xcite . at the same time",
    ", the similar distortion of the fermi pocket at @xmath84 occurs , while the fermi pocket around @xmath85 is affected less , because the @xmath5 sdw order is considered here .",
    "quite similar sdw distorted fermi surfaces have been obtained by the previous calculations @xcite based on the five orbital model . meanwhile ,",
    "our results for the single - particle spectrum are fully consistent with the previous study@xcite , as shown in fig  [ f.1](d ) .    ,",
    "@xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the intensity maps of the corresponding quasiparticle spectral functions are plotted in the right side panels.,width=307 ]    further analysis shows that the highly anisotropic fs induced by the sdw is related directly to the orbital characters of the normal state energy bands . as presented in fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) , the normal state fs is dominated by the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath89 orbitals .",
    "the overlap between the @xmath82 and @xmath84 pockets are dominated by the @xmath8 orbital , as a result , their hybridization is maximum .",
    "consequently , the coupling between the inner @xmath82 pocket and the @xmath84 pocket gives rise to a large sdw gap @xmath90 along @xmath91 axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the sdw gap @xmath92 along the @xmath93 axis is smaller .",
    "this attributes to the fact that the overlap of the @xmath7 or @xmath89 band between the @xmath82 pocket and the @xmath84 pocket is weak .",
    "however , we note that the sdw gap opens along the full @xmath6 axis , while only at individual @xmath94 point along the @xmath95 axis . in addition , the dirac cone dispersions located at @xmath93 axis are directly related to the orbital character of the relative bands@xcite .",
    "thus , the orbital degree of freedom plays an important role in the bands reconstruction in the sdw state .",
    "now , we study the energy evolution of the qpi patterns in the sdw state and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ f.2](a ) , we show the qpi pattern for @xmath96 .",
    "its main feature is obviously anisotropic with only @xmath97 symmetry and exhibits a dimer - like structure orienting along the @xmath98 direction .",
    "we also show the intensity map of the corresponding quasiparticle spectral functions(qsfs ) at the same energy in fig .",
    "[ f.2](b ) .",
    "one can see that the electronic states along the @xmath93 axis are fully gapped , which is the consequence of the opening of the sdw gap @xmath99 as can be seen from the single - particle spectrum presented in fig . [",
    "we notice that the sdw gap does not exist along the whole @xmath91 axis , although it opens at some @xmath95 points[fig .",
    "[ f.1](d ) ] .",
    "thus , the qsfs exhibit clear weights along the @xmath91 axis , and the qpi pattern is dominated by the scattering processes along the @xmath91 direction .",
    "it should be noted that at the center region around the @xmath82 point the qpi pattern exhibits like a short dimer .",
    "however , it is not the substantial feature of the scattering pattern . when the energy is slightly away from @xmath96 , the short dimer diminishes but the vertical dimer structure remains",
    "actually , this dimer - like structure of the qpi pattern persists in the energy window of @xmath100 , which coincides basically with the energy region of the sdw gap in the single - particle spectrum as shown in fig . [ f.1](d ) . with the increase of energy , the pattern develops gradually into a broad peak around the @xmath82 point and it has no obvious anisotropy as shown in fig .  [ f.2](c ) for @xmath101",
    "moreover , the intensity of the qpi pattern is nearly three times larger than that with @xmath96 .",
    "this is the specific case in that this energy happens to be near the top of the hole band around @xmath102 ( not shown here ) , where the density of states is large and consequently the qsfs show a noticeable intensity around @xmath102 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2](d ) . above this energy region ,",
    "one approaches gradually to the fermi energy , so the qsfs will copy the main features of the fs . in this case ,",

    "[ f.2](f ) . from this figure",
    ", one can see that the contour of the qsf is elongated along the @xmath103 direction , so that the portions of the contours connected by @xmath107 become more or less flat , and thus the scatterings across the vertical nearly flat portions are dominant and give rise to the vertical dimers .",
    "actually , this kind of dimer structure of the qpi patterns persists in the energy regime of @xmath108 . in the positive energy regime ,",
    "the dimer structure of the qpi pattern diminishes gradually . the typical qpi pattern is shown in fig .  [ f.2](g ) for @xmath109 , which is dominated by a peak around the @xmath82 point",
    "this is consistent with the qsfs analysis , where its anisotropy weakens significantly in the positive energy regime [ fig .",
    "[ f.2](h ) ] .",
    "it is mainly because the energy band above the fermi level is less distorted by the sdw formation , as can be seen from a comparison between fig .",

    "the qpi patterns for @xmath96 are shown in fig .",

    "[ f.2](a ) ] , the main feature still exhibits the anisotropy with the noticeable intensity of the pattern along the @xmath103 direction .",
    "it is the consequence of the gap opening due to the short - range magnetic correlation similar to that in the sdw scenario discussed above .",
    "the variation is that two new peaks emerge at the two ends of the dimer - like structure . from fig .",
    "[ f.3](a ) and ( c ) , one can also see that this kind of qpi structure is less affected by the change of @xmath64 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "we also notice that it preserves in the same energy window of @xmath100 to the case of the sdw order .",
    "it is interesting to notice that similar qpi patterns have been experimentally observed in the ferropnictide @xmath115 compounds@xcite , although the observed dimers are shorter .",

    "is mainly caused by the opening of the sdw gap along the @xmath6 direction of the single - particle spectrum which is affected less by the quasiparticle damping .",
    "thus , the anisotropic feature of the qpi pattern for @xmath96 persists even when @xmath64 is significantly reduced .     without and with the off - diagonal sdw orders , respectively .",
    "the intensity maps of the corresponding qsfs are plotted in the right panels.,width=307 ]    it was checked that the above mentioned features of the qpi patterns are qualitatively unchanged when the interacting parameters vary within a realistic region suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have also considered the effects of the band structure on qpi patterns by using the lda energy bands of lifeas@xcite .",

    "the dimers of the qpi patterns persist when the energy is around the fermi level , and they weakens gradually with the reduction of the magnetic correlation length in the magnetic nematic phase .",

    "[ f.1](c ) , the distorted energy bands due to the orbital orders are dominated by two hole bands around the @xmath82 point and two electron bands around the @xmath5 and @xmath140 points .    now , we turn to the study of the energy evolution of the qpi patterns in the orbital scenario of nematicity .",
    "the results are obtained in a wide energy window from @xmath143 to @xmath144 , and the anisotropy of the qpi pattern is rather weak when @xmath145 suggesting that it is irrelevant to the orbital orders above this energy .",
    "thus , we show the typical patterns in fig .",
    "[ kqpi ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) for @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively . for @xmath146 ,",
    "the scattering pattern is highly anisotropic with its main intensity along the @xmath149 axis , leading to a horizontal dimer .",
    "when the energy is increased to be near @xmath150 , the qpi pattern turns to be a vertical dimer .",
    "this vertical dimer remains up to a higher energy @xmath151 which is slightly above @xmath152 , although additional structures develop around the dimer . with the further increasing of energy , the anisotropy of the qpi patterns weakens significantly .",
    "especially , the scattering patterns exhibit little anisotropy in the positive energy region .    ,",
    "@xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "right panels are the intensity map of the corresponding quasiparticle spectral functions.,width=307 ]    the transition of the qpi patterns from the horizontal to vertical structure is associated with the inequivalent energy positions of the two dirac cones due to the @xmath2 symmetry breaking induced by the orbital orders . as shown in fig .",
    "[ kqpi](b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) , the spectral function shows a large intensity around the dirac cones .",
    "it attributes to the small velocity of the outer @xmath8 and @xmath7 bands around the two dirac cones .",
    "so , the qpi process is dominated by the dirac cone to dirac cone scatterings of quasiparticles . for @xmath146 ,",
    "the nearby dirac cones situate at the @xmath6 axis .",
    "but , for @xmath150 and -0.1 , they situate at the @xmath95 axis .",
    "so , the dirac cone to dirac cone scatterings lead to the transition of the qpi patterns which is related to the presence of the orbital orders .",
    "though the orbital order is momentum dependent in fese@xcite , this may vary in different kinds of ibscs . as a comparison",
    ", we will study the energy evolution of the qpi patterns with a momentum independent orbital order in this section .",
    "the parameters @xmath153 give rise to a momentum independent orbital order as that used in previous studies@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.5](a ) , the resulted energy splitting between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands are @xmath88 at @xmath82 . and",
    "it has the same splitting energy between the @xmath7 band around @xmath85 and the @xmath8 band around @xmath84 .",
    "the magnitude of this splitting energy is comparable to that obtained by the arpes experiments@xcite .     and",
    "@xmath137 directions are mainly of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 characters , respectively . panels ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) are the qpi patterns for @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively.,width=307 ]    to make a comparison to the results for the momentum dependent orbital order , we present the qpi patterns at @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ f.5](b)-(d ) .",
    "quite similarly , the main feature of the qpi patterns exhibits a transition from the horizontal dimer at a low energy @xmath146 to the vertical dimer at @xmath150 , and the vertical dimer persists up to a high energy @xmath151 .",
    "it should be noticed that the horizontal dimers with the highest intensity in fig .",
    "[ f.5](c ) are not the substantial feature of the qpi pattern due to the fact that they diminish when the energy is away from @xmath150 .",
    "it is carefully checked that the main features of the qpi patterns keep unchanged when the orbital orders evolve smoothly from the strongly momentum dependent case to the momentum independent case , if the splitting energy between the @xmath7 band at @xmath85 and the @xmath8 band at @xmath84 is fixed to be @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the above established transition of the qpi patterns is a robust phenomenon , regardless of the momentum dependence of the orbital orders .",
    "the difference in the energy splitting of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands between the momentum dependent and independent orbital orders is that there is a constant energy splitting in the latter case .",
    "thus , the two dirac cones that situate near the @xmath5 and @xmath140 points are not affected by the difference of the momentum dependence of the orbital order as shown clearly in fig .",
    "[ koob](a ) and fig .",
    "[ f.5](a ) .",
    "thus , the main feature of the qpi patterns is unchanged because it mainly arises from the dirac cones to dirac cones scatterings .    before concluding sec.iiib",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the transition of the qpi patterns is related to the @xmath2 symmetry breaking induced by the orbital order and the parities of relative bands which are both involved with the symmetry of the orbital nematic phase .",
    "thus it is expected that the above established transition remains unchanged when the interactions between electrons are taken into account .",
    "actually , there exists numerical evidence@xcite that the symmetries of relative bands do not change when the correlation effects are considered .",
    "we also note that the established transition of qpi patterns occurs at energies much below the fermi level .",
    "considering that the bandwidth is significantly reduced when the coulomb interactions are taken into account@xcite , we expect that the energy difference between the transition and the fermi level will be reduced and it will facilitate the experimental measurements . on the other hand , it was experimentally found on the fese films that the dirac cones reside slightly below the fermi level@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the transition of qpi patterns can be observed at energies close to the fermi level in some iron pnictides , at least in the fese films .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied theoretically the quasiparticle scattering interference patterns in the nematic phase of the iron - based superconductors based on the magnetic and orbital scenarios , respectively .",
    "deep in the sdw state , the qpi patterns exhibit a dimer structure in a wide energy region and develop a bi - dimer structure when the energy is increased to be near the fermi level . it is also shown that the dimer structure of the qpi patterns still exists when the sdw state is replaced by the state with fluctuating magnetic order , though the bi - dimer structure is smeared due to the mergence of the two sets of dimers when the short - range correlation length is significantly decreased .    thus , we identify that the qpi dimers present in the sdw and the magnetic nematic phase orient along the ferromagnetic direction of the sdw order as long as the correlation length is not significantly decreased .",
    "our results based on the magnetic scenario of nematicity are qualitatively consistent with the stm observations on nafeas@xcite .    in the orbital scenario of nematicity , the qpi patterns are dominated by a dimer structure along the @xmath154 or @xmath103 axes in a wide energy region .",
    "a @xmath0 rotation of the dimer structure occurs when the energy increases from the lower dirac node to the higher one . above the two dirac nodes ,",
    "the anisotropy of the qpi patterns is significantly weakened .",
    "furthermore , it is found that this transition is insensitive to the momentum dependence of the orbital order .",
    "theoretically , the suggestions for distinguishing the sdw order from the orbital driven nematicity by using stm technique have been proposed@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite focus on the contributions of the band extrema ( local maxima or minima in the bands ) to the local density of states ( ldos ) and qpi .",
    "they found that the features related to the differences between two band extrema which track the orbital splitting or the sdw gap can be used to distinguish between the orbital splitting and the sdw order .",
    "the features are easy to be detected in ldos , but are obscured in qpi by contributions from orbitals other than @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "et al._@xcite focus on the qpi at an energy near the fermi level , so the anisotropic qpi patterns are closely related to the topology of the sdw or orbital order distorted constant energy contours near the fermi level . here",
    ", we uncover the significant contributions to qpi from the dirac cone to dirac cone scatterings of quasiparticles in the orbital scenario . for the magnetic scenario ,",
    "we elaborate the robust dimer structure in qpi patterns resulting from the highly anisotropic sdw gaps in the momentum space which are directly related to the orbital characters of the folded bands .",
    "we further show that due to the inequivalent energies of the two dirac nodes , the dimer structure in the orbital scenario undergoes a @xmath0 rotation with the increase of energy , which contrasts clearly with the case of the magnetic scenario .",
    "these features of the qpi patterns have not been addressed in previous studies@xcite .",
    "in addition , compared to ref .",
    "@xcite in which the two - orbital model is used , we carry out the calculations by using the more realistic five - orbital model .    from the results presented in this paper ,",
    "we conclude that the qpi patterns exhibit dimer structure in a wide energy region in both the magnetic and the orbital scenarios of nematicity .",
    "the dimer tends to orient along the ferromagnetic direction in the magnetic case .",
    "however , it undergoes a @xmath0 rotation with the increase of energy in the orbital case .",
    "thus , our results established in this paper for the qpi patterns may be used to probe the origin of nematicity in various iron - based superconductors .",
