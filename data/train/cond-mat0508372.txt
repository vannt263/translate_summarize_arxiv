    "in umklapp scattering a cooper pair may contest a state which is the destination of another pair in normal scattering ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "consequently the contribution to superconductivity is frustrated  @xcite .",
    "we find that on average only 15% of phonons are involved in pairing electrons in 12 common superconductive metals .",
    "were the frustration effect of umklapp scattering lifted , metals would be superconductive at remarkably high temperatures , for example 980 k in the case of tin  @xcite .",
    "this result is found from the original approach of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) , based on the method of variation  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask if the same result could be found from the standard field - theoretic approach , based on the method of the green function  @xcite",
    ".    the green function method can be highly sophisticated .",
    "as a first attempt , we follow a relatively simple approach which , to our knowledge , was pioneered by hubbard  @xcite to describe collective motions in terms of many - body perturbation theory , with many features common to the standard field - theoretic approach . for example both approaches start with the formula of gell - mann and low  @xcite , which involves an expansion of the scattering matrix or @xmath0-matrix . in both approaches the treatment of wick is applied in order to reduce the operator chain into a @xmath1-number  @xcite . the diagram technique is also used in both approaches to identify the relevant physical process and facilitate calculation , etc .",
    "detailed knowledge about one approach will certainly help us to understand the other .    in a field - theoretic approach it is customary to start with an ensemble of free particles .",
    "then the interaction is switched on adiabatically in time . according to gell - mann and",
    "low an eigen - state of the free particles evolves adiabatically and eventually becomes an eigen - state of the ensemble with interaction .",
    "apparently this approach is applicable to say the stark effect , which can be literally switched on adiabatically , and is characterized by either of the following chains of events : @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the wave - vectors of the electron and photon respectively , @xmath5 or@xmath6 spin . in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) the electron absorbs a photon from the external field and then emits it . in the second line",
    "the electron emits a photon and then absorbs one again . in both cases the electron returns to its original state , reflecting",
    "that the external field alters the electron orbit , rather than forces the electron to jump orbit .",
    "we find through this simple version of the field - theoretic approach that , when we switch on the electron - phonon interaction in a particle ensemble , the ensemble energy changes .",
    "apart from an additional factor of 2 , the strength of the interaction is the same as that in the bcs theory",
    ". the electrons always return to their original state , a situation similar to the stark effect , but different from the picture of the bcs theory .",
    "indeed , we find that the energy change of each and every electron is of the same sign and they do not cancel .",
    "there is no need to pair the electrons .",
    "consequently there can be no umklapp frustration of superconductivity .",
    "we emphasize we are not criticizing the work of hubbard : he did not employ his approach to study superconductivity  @xcite .    to deal with superconductivity",
    "we adapt the approach in  @xcite slightly .",
    "we alter the path of scattering so that the electrons no longer return to their original state .",
    "pairing becomes necessary , otherwise there will be no change of the ensemble energy .",
    "now the process is characterized by the following event : @xmath7 here the two electrons jump orbits after exchanging virtual phonons .",
    "the energy of the electron ensemble is lowered , not because some slowly introduced interaction alters the energy of the electron orbits .",
    "rather , when the two electrons jump orbits in a coherent manner , they are in a configuration of a lower energy .",
    "we also find umklapp frustration .",

    "unless stated otherwise , we always use the schrdinger representation .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "could we go a step further to have only one pair in the initial state ?",
    "then umklapp frustration will vanish . since this question carries physical consequences , it concerns situations in physics rather than formalisms in mathematics .",
    "one such situation is that either @xmath102 or @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i1 ] ) is always forbidden to generate a pair , which apparently is unreasonable .",
    "another situation is that , when one pair is scattered in accordance with the scenario in eq .",

    "this too is unreasonable because , apart from their spins , the two pairs generated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : i1 ] ) are identical .",
    "we have no reason to treat them differently in electron - phonon scattering , not to mention that numerical test has already confirmed the existence of umklapp scattering  @xcite .",
    "so far we have not discussed coulomb repulsion , which has been proved to have negligible effect on superconductivity , apparently due to the situation that in a metal the coulomb force between electrons is in a balance , which can be toppled by even weak attraction due to the electron - phonon interaction  @xcite . to see this , we replace @xmath12 in eqs .",

    "<S> the formula of gell - mann and low can be applied to both the stark effect and superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the standard version of the field - theoretic approach fits the stark effect , because in this version electrons have identical initial and end states , so that the energy of each and every electron orbit acquires a shift in the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary alternative version of the field - theoretic approach is introduced , in which the electrons have different initial and end states , to accommodate superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the energy of the electrons acquires a random shift , which will cancel macroscopically , unless the electrons are paired . </S>",
    "<S> it also becomes apparent that superconductivity is frustrated when normal and umklapp scattering coexist . </S>"
