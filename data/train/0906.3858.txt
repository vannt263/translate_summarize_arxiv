    "the recent reported results on the abnormal excesses of cosmic ray ( cr ) positron fraction by pamela @xcite and the spectra of electrons by atic @xcite , ppb - bets @xcite , h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite and fermi - lat @xcite have invoked extensive discussions on the possible existence of dark matter ( dm ) signals ( for a recent review , see e.g. , @xcite ) . meanwhile , the ratio of antiproton to proton measured by pamela @xcite is well consistent with the astrophysical expectation from interactions between cr nuclei and interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "it indicates that if the dm contributes to the electron / positron excesses , it should dominantly annihilate or decay into leptons instead of gauge bosons or quarks @xcite .",
    "although the observational data of the electron spectra from atic and fermi - lat / h.e.s.s . are not fully consistent , it has been shown in literature that the dm models with annihilation or decay modes directly to leptons can give good description to the observational data , given proper mass of dm particle and flavors of the final state particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . specifically , the atic data favor a @xmath1 channel to describe the bump and fast drop for energy @xmath9 gev @xcite . while for fermi - lat and h.e.s.s .",
    "data , a softer electron / positron spectrum from the decay of @xmath6 or @xmath7 final states can better reproduce the smooth behavior @xcite",
    ".    however , for the numerical studies of fitting to the data in the literature so far one usually takes some specific parameters for a given model , then fits to the data for illustrations of how the model works instead of performing a global analysis .",
    "therefore bias exists in the conclusions drawn from this kind of studies . a global fit to the observational data thus will be very useful to extract the model - independent implication from the data and to explore the correlations among different parameters . in this work",
    "we employ a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique @xcite to globally fit the parameters of the dm scenario to the experimental data on the electron / positron spectrum observed .",
    "the constraint from the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission around the galactic center ( gc ) , known as gc ridge , by h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite is also included in the mcmc program . based on the global fitting results",
    ", we can then further investigate the possible implication on the models of both on the particle physical side and also the astrophysical side of dm , in a manner of self - consistency .",
    "another issue which is not seriously taken into account in previous studies is the influence of electron / positron background on the dm models .",
    "the global fit method makes it possible to include the uncertainties of the background contribution .",
    "this point is also discussed in this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the production mechanism of the electrons and positrons generated from dm annihilation or decay , and their propagation effect in the milky way ( mw ) . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the accompanied @xmath0-rays which are served as a cross check of the self - consistency of the model configuration . the mcmc fitting procedure and results",
    "are given in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v is the summary .",
    "due to the constraints from @xmath11 by pamela , the dm is thought to be dominately coupled with leptons @xcite . since in this work we mainly focus on the methodology of using mcmc to globally fit the observational data , we will limit our discussion in the cases that dm annihilates or decays to lepton pairs directly .",
    "the production rate of electrons ( positrons ) can be written as @xmath12 for dm annihilation , or @xmath13 for dm decay , where @xmath14 is the mass of dm particle , @xmath15 or @xmath16 are the annihilation cross section or decay age of dm respectively , @xmath17 is the electron yield spectrum for one annihilation or decay with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is dm spatial density in the mw halo .",
    "the density profile of the mw halo is taken as the form @xmath20 where @xmath0 represents the central cusp slope of the density profile , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are scale radius and density respectively . for the mw dm halo ,",
    "we adopt the total mass to be @xmath23 m@xmath24 @xcite and the concentration parameter to be @xmath25 @xcite",
    ". then we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 kpc is the virial radius of mw halo",
    ". then @xmath22 can be derived by requiring @xmath28 .",
    "the local density @xmath29 in this process is checked to be within @xmath30 to @xmath31 gev @xmath32 for @xmath0 varying from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "after the production from dm annihilation or decay , the electrons and positrons will propagate diffusively in the mw due to the scattering with the random magnetic field . besides the diffusion , the dominant process of electron propagation is the energy loss from synchrotron radiation in galactic magnetic field and the inverse compton ( ic ) scatterings in the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "there may also be global convection driven by stellar wind and reacceleration by random interstellar shock , however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these effects can be safely neglected for electron energy @xmath35 gev .",
    "the propagation equation is @xmath36=q({\\bf r},e),\\ ] ] where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the rigidity ) is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 s , is the energy loss rate for typical values of the galactic magnetic field and isrf , @xmath42 is the source function of @xmath10 as given in eqs .",

    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath61 kpc@xmath62  myr@xmath63 , @xmath64 and the height of the diffusive halo @xmath65 kpc .",
    "for the purely leptonic annihilation or decay of dm particles , @xmath0-rays can be generally produced in two ways .",
    "one is the final state radiation ( fsr ) which is emitted directly from the external legs when dm particles annihilates or decays to charged leptons leptons will produce a large number of neutral pions which can then decay into photons .",
    "we also include this contribution in the fsr . ] .",
    "the other is the ic scattering photons from isrf when the electrons and positrons propagate in the mw .",
    "compared with the ic photons , the fsr has several advantages .",
    "first the spectrum of fsr is unique and may give smoking gun diagnostic for dm signal .",
    "in addition , the fsr does not depend on the astrophysical environment such as the distribution of isrf .",
    "therefore in this work we only consider the fsr .",
    "it will simplify the calculation , meanwhile the results obtained on the constraints on the model parameters is also conservative .",
    "the photon yield spectrum for @xmath10 or @xmath66 channel for @xmath67 can be written as @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the fine structure constant , @xmath70 .",
    "for dm annihilation we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; while for dm decay @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite . for @xmath75 channel ,",
    "we adopt the total parameterization including the direct fsr component as shown in eq.([fsr_emu ] ) and the decay products from the chain @xmath76 @xcite @xmath77 with the same definition of @xmath78 as above .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux along a specific direction can be written as @xmath79 where the integral is taken along the line - of - sight ( los ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 represent the particle physics factor and the astrophysical factor respectively , @xmath82 kpc is the solar system location from gc , and @xmath83 is the local dm density . for the emission from a diffuse region with solid angle @xmath84 , we define the average astrophysical factor as @xmath85 which is fully determined by the parameter @xmath0 in eq.([profile ] ) .    in this work",
    "we use the diffuse @xmath0-ray observation in the sky region @xmath86 and @xmath87 around the gc by h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite to constrain the central profile of dm density distribution .",
    "it should be noted that the h.e.s.s .",
    "observation of the gc ridge @xmath0-ray flux is a background subtracted one . in ref .",
    "@xcite the emission from @xmath88 , @xmath89 is taken as the background . therefore the h.e.s.s .",
    "reported result is not the total emission of the selected sky region , but a lowered one . to compare the calculated result with the data , we calculate the @xmath0-ray flux from dm in the h.e.s.s .",
    "signal region ( @xmath87 , @xmath89 ) with subtracting the one in the h.e.s.s .",
    "background region ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath90 factor adopted for the @xmath0-ray calculation actually means @xmath91 in the following .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we employ a power - law component @xmath92 to represent the astrophysical background contribution to the @xmath0-rays .",
    "the fsr from dm is then added to the background to fit the observational data .",
    "the fit to the @xmath0-ray data is also included in the mcmc code so that we can derive a consistent constraint on the dm density profile .",
    "in our study , we perform a global analysis employing the mcmc technique to determine the parameters related to dm models . the mcmc sampler is implemented by using the metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "it is an efficient procedure for generating samples which lies in the fact that its equilibrium distribution corresponds to the likelihood function in parameter space . comparing with a traditional approach where the likelihood function is evaluated on a grid of points in parameter space",
    ", the mcmc method has the great potential in expanding the dimension of the parameter series , since the computational requirements of mcmc procedures are insensitive to the dimensionality of the parameter space .",
    "fixing the @xmath1 backgrond , we have the following parameter space : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the dm particle mass , @xmath95 is the annihilation cross section , for decaying dm @xmath16 denotes the lifetime , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the annihilation ( or decay ) branching ratios of dm particle into @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairs . for the scenario considered in this work , we have the constraint condition @xmath99 . the parameter @xmath0 parametrizes the dm density profile and @xmath100 ,",
    "@xmath101 are parameters characterizing astrophysical @xmath0-ray background .",
    "so in our global fitting procedure @xmath102 free parameters are in general involved .    with variables in ( [ parameter ] )",
    "we can calculate the theoretical expectations of electrons and positrons produced from dm .",
    "however , to compare with the observational data , we still need to give the astrophysical background contribution to the electrons and positrons .",
    "since the background calculation , especially for positrons , is quite complicated and consumes a lot of time , we employ two approaches of the background .",
    "firstly we fix the background calculated by galprop package @xcite based on a conventional diffusion + convection ( dc ) model @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the conventional galprop model can give fairly good description to the cr data before pamela / atic / fermi - lat / h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , as well as the all - sky diffuse @xmath0-ray data from egret ( except the `` gev excess '' , @xcite ) and fermi - lat at intermediate latitudes @xcite .",
    "the galprop model parameters are the same as ref .",
    "@xcite except for the high energy electron injection spectrum we adopt a slightly softer one @xmath103 . for the second approach",
    "we include a more complete treatment on this problem . a power law function @xmath104 with two free parameters @xmath105",
    "is involved to describe the injection source of primary electrons . for background positrons which are thought to be produced through crs interact with ism , we use the locally measured proton and helium spectra as parameterized in ref .",
    "@xcite and an average ism density @xmath106 @xmath32 to calculate the positron production rate . for the secondaries production from @xmath107 inelastic collision",
    "we use the parameterization given in ref .",
    "the interaction is restricted in a thin disk with half height @xmath108 kpc .",
    "the spatial distribution of positron source is neglected , which is demonstrated not to affect the final positron spectrum @xcite .",
    "in addition , we employ a free factor @xmath109 lies between @xmath110 and @xmath111 to describe the possible uncertainties about the ism density and the disk height .",
    "that is to say , totaly we will have @xmath112 free parameters in this approach .      since the electron spectrum measurements between atic and fermi - lat / h.e.s.s",
    "still have discrepancy , for an unbiased study at the current stage we will try to fit two different data sets respectively .",
    "one is to combine the pamela positron fraction data , atic electron data and the h.e.s.s .",
    "@xmath0-ray data ( data set i ) , and the other is the combination of pamela , fermi - lat , h.e.s.s .",
    "electron and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xmath0-ray data ( data set ii ) .",
    "note that for pamela we use only the data with energies higher than @xmath113 gev in the mcmc fitting code .",
    "the low energy data are thought to be more easily to be affected by the solar modulation .",
    "we get the @xmath114 by comparing the spectrum between the theoretical expectations and the corresponding observational values . for the pamela ,",
    "the observation quantity is the positron fraction @xmath115 , while for atic , fermi - lat and h.e.s.s .",
    "the undistinguished fluxes of positrons and electrons are concerned .",
    "we have taken the total likelihood to be the products of the separate likelihoods @xmath116 of all the data .",
    "in other words , defining @xmath117 , we get @xmath118 where @xmath119 labels different observational data .        firstly we consider the fixed background approach .",
    "the one dimensional probability distributions of the fitting parameters for annihilation dm scenario are shown in fig.[fig : anni ] .",
    "the _ left _ eight panels are for data set i , and the _ right _ eight panels are for data set ii respectively . to get the @xmath120 probability of each parameter we have marginalized over the other parameters .",
    "the details about the parameters are compiled in table [ table : anni ] .    to reproduce the peak of atic observation of data set i",
    ", the mass of dm is found to be @xmath121 tev with annihilation channel almost purely to @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath122 upper limits for @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels are @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively . while for the fit to data set ii , a larger mass @xmath4 tev with larger @xmath97 and @xmath98 which can give softer electron / positron spectra is favored . the @xmath1 channel which can give strongly peaked electron / positron spectra",
    "is remarkably suppressed .",
    "the @xmath122 upper limit for @xmath96 is @xmath125 .",
    "an important issue is the constraint from gc diffuse @xmath0-rays observed by h.e.s.s .. a strong constraint on the central dm density profile is shown . at @xmath122 level , we find @xmath126 for data set i and @xmath127 for data set ii .",
    "it is significantly flatter than the canonical nfw profile with @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that dm particle might not be so cold , but behaves like warm dm instead @xcite .",
    "we can also note that the probability distributions of @xmath97 and @xmath98 are relatively broad for the data set ii fit .",
    "the reason for this is due to the degeneracy between @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels .",
    "we will discuss this issue later .     approach . to get the @xmath120 probability of each parameter we have marginalized over the other parameters .",

    "in this work we employ a mcmc technique to determine the parameters of dm scenario in interpreting the recent observations of electron spectra and positron fraction data .",
    "both the dm annihilation and decay are considered in this work .",
    "the dm particle is assumed to couple only with leptons .",
    "considering the discrepancy between experimental data from atic and fermi - lat / h.e.s.s . , we fit two data sets independently .",
    "we find that for data set i ( pamela+atic ) , dm with @xmath131 tev for annihilation ( or @xmath3 tev for decay ) and a non - negligible @xmath1 component is favored . for data set ii ( pamela+fermi - lat+h.e.s.s . )",
    "@xmath4 tev for annihilation ( or @xmath5 tev for decay ) and the combination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 final states can best fit the data .",
    "there is degeneracy between parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the constraint on the central density profile of dm halo from the diffuse @xmath0-rays near the gc is also included in the mcmc code self - consistently .",
    "we find the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations of the gc @xmath0-rays can give strong constraint on the dm density slope of the central cusp for the annihilation dm scenario .",
    "in that case the nfw profile with @xmath128 , which is regarded as the typical predication from cold dm scenario , is excluded with a high significance ( @xmath8 ) . for the decaying dm scenario ,",
    "the constraint is much weaker .",
    "we find that the largest uncertainties on the determination of dm branching ratios come from the limited understanding of the @xmath1 background .",
    "besides using the canonical background expectations from cr propagation models , we further consider the approach to involve the background uncertainties .",
    "three additional free parameters are adopted to describe the background contribution and fitted globally with the dm parameters .",
    "it is shown that the branching ratios depend sensitively on the background results .",
    "the limited knowledge about the background actually prevents us from a precise determination of the dm final state information .",
    "however , with the accumulation of more observational data from pamela , ams02 and many other upcoming experiments with much higher precision and detailed information of each species , we may expect to get better understanding on both the background and the `` exotic signal '' ( if exists ) . while global fitting will be the only way to separate the background and signal , and derive model - independent implications of the data .",
    "since the mcmc method works in a full high - dimensional parameter space , the code developed in this work will be a useful tool in studying both the cr physics and the exotic new physics , given more precise observational data in the future .",
    "we do not include the radio constraints on the synchrotron radiation of the models in this work , though the radio observations in the gc region might set even stronger constraints than @xmath0-rays , as studied in refs .",
    "the radio constraints are found to be sensitive to the dm profile , instead of the central most configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "however , since the knowledge of the magnetic field relies on some assumptions such as the accretion state of central black hole and the equipartition of the matter kinetic energy with the magnetic pressure @xcite , we think there are still uncertainties of the radio constraints .",
    "additionally , one expects that antiproton constraints would be important for the tau channel , which has not yet been considered in the current work .",
    "this combined with the radio bound may provide a stringent constraint for the @xmath16 channel , which deserves a detailed study in future .    as an end",
    ", we would like to mention that , there exists a self - consistent way to explain the current data by introducing a light mediator state in dm annihilation ( or decay ) @xcite , which has not yet been considered in the current work .",
    "the distinct advantages of this type of models are that , the strongly constrained decay into hadrons is kinematically forbidden , and sommerfeld enhancement with small velocity of galactic dm allows for the large annihilation cross sections required by observations .",
    "this kind of model is not included in this work due to the fact that , we need to introduce more parameters in the fitting such as the mass of the mediator which can not be effectively constrained by the current data on the one hand , and the present work is the first step of the application of mcmc method in dm indirect searches on the other hand .",
    "we hope the forthcoming improvement of the method can partially address this issue .",
