    "according to most of the models of merger - driven quasar / massive galaxy co - evolution , quasars should undergo an heavily obscured phase associated with the presence of massive outflows capable of sweeping the bulk of the gas reservoir away from the surrounding host galaxy ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; cattaneo et al . 2009 ; zubovas & king 2012 ) .",

    "furthermore ,  belongs to the rare subclass of low - ionization broad absorption line ( lobal ) quasars , which exhibit low - ionization ( i.e. mgii and aliii ) bals and very weak [ oiii ] emission in their optical spectra .",
    "their unusual properties were explained by boroson & meyers ( 1992 ) in terms of absorption with higher column density and larger covering fraction than in other bal quasars , which blocks the ionizing radiation from the nucleus that normally illuminates the narrow - line region .",
    "supergiant expanding bubbles of ionized gas on kpc - scale have been also detected ( see lipari et al .",
    "2009 ) .    the remarkable discovery of spatially - extended , broad wings in the co(j=1 - 0 ) emission line profile with interferometric millimeter observations of  ( feruglio et al .",
    "2010 ) revealed the presence of a giant molecular outflow with an estimated mass outflow rate of @xmath0700 m@xmath14 yr@xmath6 , which largely exceeds the ongoing sfr in the host galaxy .",
    "this finding provided one of the very first direct and compelling evidence of quasar - driven feedback removing large amounts of molecular gas , i.e. the material of star formation , from the central regions of the galaxy ( then confirmed by rupke & veilleux 2011 , aalto et al .",
    "2012 and cicone et al .",
    "all these results support the hypothesis that in  both the nucleus and the host galaxy are undergoing a key phase , still poorly investigated , in the evolution from an ulirg / gas - rich system to a standard , x - ray- and optically - bright quasar in a passive galaxy .",
    "this motivates to shed further light on the properties of the central engine in  via penetrating x - ray observations .",

    "the photon index of the x - ray continuum and reflection is fixed to @xmath21 = 1.9 , i.e. the typical value measured for quasars ( piconcelli et al . 2005 ) .",

    "nonetheless , we prefer a solution in which the reflection component is left outside the two - component partial - covering absorber as the constant fe k line flux suggests that the reflection originates far away the continuum source , while the partial - covering and warm nature of the compton - thin absorption is more consistent with an inner , nuclear location rather than a pc - scale one .",

    "( 2002 ) to question the reflection - dominated hypothesis for the x - ray spectrum of this quasar , although such variability was not detected in any of the subsequent three similar  exposures performed in 2003 .",
    "they suggested the existence of a third spectral component , i.e. an absorbed (  @xmath0 3 @xmath4 10@xmath1 2 ) power law , in addition to the thermal plasma and the reflection continuum , which may arise from a compact x - ray scattering medium .",

    "( 2005 ) found an acceptable fit to the combined 0.5 - 8 kev spectrum from the four  observations with a model consisting of a power law modified by three absorbers plus soft thermal emission , which may resemble our dpca model in terms of overall spectral shape in this energy band , weak  emission and , mostly , for the presence of a multi - component absorber .",
    "furthermore , the consistency of the flux of the  emission line over 2001 - 2003 found by  and   observations of is suggestive of a compton reflection component likely to be associated with distant , optically thick material , and , remarkably , the 2011  data lend further support to this scenario . the dpca model proposed here is therefore able to explain in a coherent fashion the several pieces of evidence collected over the years thanks to the previous limited bandpass and/or less sensitive x - ray observations .",
    "the hard x - ray flux values measured from the  observations are consistent each other and are slightly larger ( i.e. consistent within 2@xmath15 ) than the  value ( gallagher et al . 2005 ) . in the proposed dpca scenario ,",
    "this can be interpreted as lack of large variations in the physical properties of the ct absorber .",
    "the presence of the highly absorbed power - law emission at @xmath51 15 kev above the extrapolation of the 2 - 10 kev spectrum claimed by b04 thanks to the 2001  observation is fully confirmed by the present  data .",
    "x - ray spectral properties of lobal are very scarce due to their weakness in the 0.5 - 10 kev range ( green et al . 2001 ; morabito et al .",

    "even much more extraordinary is the detection of these objects at higher energies : as far we know ,  is the only member of this class of agn for which a spectrum has been collected in the band above 10 kev .",
    "the change in the spectral shape discovered here as well as the short - timescale variability in the hard - band emission reported by gallagher et al . ( 2002 ) ( assuming an origin in the multi - component absorber ) seems to indicate that the bulk of the x - ray obscuration likely occurs in a compact region much closer to the x - ray source than the canonical 0.1 - 1 pc - scale torus invoked in the unified model , or extended structures in the complex circumnuclear environment of  ( e.g. klockner et al .",

    "2001 ; piconcelli et al . 2005 ; morabito et al . 2011 ; giustini et al . 2011 ) they have been indeed associated with the bal outflow ( e.g. elvis 2000 ) , which is likely launched from the accretion disk surrounding the supermassive black hole ( young et al .",
    "2007 ) , and their variability explained in terms of outflowing clouds crossing our los .",
    "in particular , it has been proposed that this wind must be shielded from the x - ray continuum source to prevent the bal absorbing clouds from becoming too highly ionized .",
    "this would inhibit a very efficient mechanism of gas acceleration such as the radiation - driven acceleration , by eliminating most of the uv transitions that absorb the photons necessary to accelerate the outflowing gas ( murray et al .",
    "1995 ; proga 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "this x - ray - shielding region must be effectively opaque to x - rays , as well as sufficiently ionized ( and dust - free ) to allow uv line opacity , and might represent the inner section of the wind itself ( and/or located at the extreme base of the outflow ) .",
    "the properties of the dpca discovered in  match well with those predicted for the shielding gas by the bal outflow models , providing an important observation - based evidence for the theory of physical mechanism responsible for launching and accelerating agn winds .",
    "these nuclear , highly supersonic outflows are believed to compress the surrounding medium and generate a shock , which moves outwards and sweeps the surrounding medium out , i.e. _ the agn feedback mechanism _",
    "( menci et al . 2008 ; zubovas & king 2012 ) .",
    "the presence of a partially - covering absorber suggests that the typical size of the x - ray absorber along our los is comparable with that of the x - ray continuum source .",
    "the latter is likely of the order of @xmath010 @xmath52 , as estimated via occultation or microlensing in a few agns ( dai et al .",
    "2010 ; risaliti et al . 2007 ;",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "accordingly , the dpca is not the torus envisaged by the unification model , which can be however present in , as it should lie ( i ) on larger scales and ( ii ) edge - on with respect to our los .",
    "the non - variable reflection emission component observed in the x - ray spectrum of  is likely associated to this obscuring / reprocessing medium located distant from the central engine .",
    "finally , the broad bandpass of  allows us to measure the intrinsic luminosity of the x - ray source in .",
    "we find an intrinsic luminosity of  = 3.3 @xmath4 10@xmath5  in the 2 - 10 kev energy range , while the luminosity in the 15 - 30 kev pin band is 1.7 @xmath4 10@xmath5 .",
    "using the dpca model for the joint  @xmath22  spectrum , we calculate a  = 2.6 @xmath4 10@xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this x - ray luminosity with that expected on the basis of well - established isotropic indicator of agn luminosity .",
    "the luminosity of the mid - ir emission line [ o iv ] 25.89@xmath53 m has been shown to be one of the most accurate proxies of  ( melendez et al .",
    "armus et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reported an upper limit for the [ o iv ] 25.89@xmath53 m luminosity of  @xmath3 2.64 @xmath4 10@xmath54  based on 2004 _ spitzer _ data .",
    "using the ",
    "relation in melendez et al .",
    "( see table 3 ) , the predicted 2 - 10 kev luminosity for   is @xmath3 3.7 @xmath4 10@xmath5 .",
    "this matches well with the  values deduced from both  and  observations .",
    "similar results are also obtained by the comparison of the luminosity in the 14 - 195 kev range predicted on the basis of , i.e.  @xmath3 10@xmath16 , and those estimated from  and  @xmath22  data , i.e.  = 7 and 5.7 @xmath4 10@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "future x - ray observations with broad - band x - ray capabilities ( i.e. , _ nustar _ and _ astro - h _ ) as well as well - defined monitoring program with present - day x - ray telescopes will allow to provide much more detailed insights into the kinetic , geometrical and physical properties of the nuclear absorber(s ) in this composite ulirg / lobal quasar , where agn - driven outflows in the neutral , ionized and molecular gas capable of quenching star formation in the host galaxy have been found .",
