    "mainstream semiconductors such as silicon and germanium play a key role in the development of a spintronics information technology in which spin is used to represent digital data @xcite . to create and detect spin - polarized carriers in non - magnetic materials ,",
    "the use of ferromagnetic tunnel contacts has proven to be a robust and technologically viable approach that is widely used in spin - based devices , including those with si and ge @xcite .",
    "as recently reviewed @xcite , controversy has arisen because in many semiconductor spintronic devices , the magnitude of the observed spin voltage differs by several orders of magnitude from what is expected based on the available theory for spin injection and diffusion @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all theories is that the injected spin current produces a spin accumulation @xmath2 , i.e. , a spin splitting in the electrochemical potential and thus a spin - dependent occupation of the electronic states in the non - magnetic material .",
    "conservation of spin - angular momentum requires the injected spin current to be balanced by spin relaxation , from which the steady - state non - equilibrium spin accumulation is evaluated .",
    "consequently , the spin accumulation is predicted to be linearly proportional to the injected spin current .",
    "+ a powerful way to test the predictions is to vary the thickness of the tunnel barrier , which changes the current density @xmath3 exponentially .",
    "the spin accumulation is expected to exhibit a similar exponential variation , so that @xmath4 remains constant . here",
    "we present an extensive set of spin - transport data on si and ge based magnetic tunnel devices with different tunnel oxides .",
    "the scaling of the detected spin voltage with tunnel oxide thickness violates the expected linear proportionality of spin voltage and injected spin current .",
    "the data is shown to be incompatible with any of the known theories , including those based on direct tunneling @xcite or two - step tunneling via localized states @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the generic nature of the observed scaling , we use devices with heavily doped si ( p - type and n - type ) as well as p - type ge , with an amorphous al@xmath5o@xmath6 tunnel barrier and ni@xmath7fe@xmath8 ferromagnet , or with epitaxial , crystalline mgo / fe contacts .",
    "tunnel contacts on si(001 ) surfaces were fabricated using @xmath9-type silicon - on - insulator wafers with a 5 @xmath10 m thick active si layer having as - doping and a resistivity of 3 m@xmath11 cm at 300 k , or @xmath12-type silicon - on - insulator wafers with a 3 @xmath10 m thick active si layer having b - doping and a resistivity of 11 m@xmath11 cm at 300 k. for the contacts with amorphous al@xmath13o@xmath14 , the si substrate was treated by hydrofluoric acid to remove oxide , the substrate was introduced into the ultrahigh vacuum chamber , and the tunnel barrier was prepared by electron - beam deposition of al@xmath13o@xmath14 from a single - crystal al@xmath13o@xmath14 source , followed by plasma oxidation for 2.5 minutes , and electron - beam deposition of the ferromagnetic - metal top electrode ( typically 10 nm thick ) and a au cap layer , all at room temperature . for some devices ( appendix a ) the plasma oxidation step was omitted .",
    "the plasma oxidation leads to the formation of some additional silicon oxide .",
    "the actual tunnel oxide thickness is thus slightly larger than the nominal thickness of the deposited al@xmath13o@xmath14 , as previously confirmed and quantified @xcite by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "values of the tunnel oxide thickness quoted in this manuscript correspond to the corrected , actual oxide thickness extracted from tem , and for convenience this is referred to as the al@xmath13o@xmath14 thickness .",
    "+ for epitaxial contacts @xcite with mgo / fe , after treatment with buffered hydrofluoric acid , the si substrate was annealed in the ultrahigh vacuum deposition system to 700@xmath15c for 10 minutes to obtain a 2@xmath161 reconstructed si surface . the mgo tunnel barrier and the fe electrode ( 10 nm thick ) were deposited at 300@xmath15c and 100@xmath15c , respectively , and the crystalline nature of the layers was confirmed by _ in situ _ reflection high - energy electron diffraction and by high - resolution tem , as reported recently @xcite . tunnel devices on p - type ge(001 ) were prepared using ga - doped wafers with a resistivity of 3 m@xmath11 cm and a carrier concentration of 8.2@xmath1610@xmath17 @xmath18 at 300 k. the preparation of the epitaxial mgo / fe tunnel contacts on ge was as previously described @xcite .",
    "+ to probe the spin accumulation over a large range of the tunnel barrier thickness , we employ three - terminal devices @xcite in which a single ferromagnetic tunnel contact is used to inject the spin accumulation , and to detect it .",
    "this geometry , unlike 4-terminal non - local devices @xcite , allows the contact area to be chosen arbitrarily large so as to adjust the overall device resistance and thereby ensure a sufficient signal to noise ratio . here , the tunnel junction area is between 10@xmath1610 @xmath19 and 100@xmath16200 @xmath19 .",

    "1 ) . the hanle ( inverted hanle ) signal originates from the suppression ( recovery ) of the spin accumulation due to spin precession ( or the reduction thereof ) , and is the signature of the presence of a spin accumulation @xcite .",
    "the most striking observation is that the amplitude of the spin signal ( the spin ra product , defined as @xmath20 , the spin voltage signal per unit of @xmath3 ) increases by orders of magnitude when the thickness of the tunnel barrier is increased .",

    "this , in turn , changes the tunnel spin polarization , which is known to vary with the energy of the tunnel electrons @xcite .",
    "this additional source of variation of the spin signal with tunnel oxide thickness is not present in our data , which was obtained using the same bias voltage for each oxide thickness .",
    "our collection of data leads to the striking and unexpected conclusion that @xmath20 is not a constant but scales with @xmath25 , and up to values larger than 10@xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior is generic , as it is observed for devices with different semiconductors , tunnel oxides , and ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "below we explain that this behavior is incompatible with any of the known theories for the injection , accumulation and diffusion of spins in ferromagnetic tunnel devices .",
    "in the standard theory , the spin accumulation gives rise to a hanle spin signal @xmath27\\,r_s\\,j$ ] , where @xmath28 is the tunnel spin polarization associated with the oxide / ferromagnet interface , and @xmath29 is the spin resistance of the semiconductor @xcite that describes the relation between spin current and spin accumulation in non - magnetic materials .",
    "thus , @xmath20 is constant and independent of the resistance @xmath25 of the tunnel contact .",
    "this applies when @xmath25 is larger than @xmath29 . if @xmath30 , back flow of the spins into the ferromagnet limits the spin signal @xcite , which is then proportional to the tunnel resistance : @xmath31\\,r_{tun}$ ] .",
    "although this produces a scaling with tunnel resistance , the experimentally observed scaling extends to tunnel ra values beyond 10@xmath0 @xmath1 , and a value of @xmath29 larger than this would be required for back flow to be active .",
    "this is unreasonable , since @xmath29 is typically around 10 - 100 @xmath1 for the semiconductors used @xcite .",
    "the standard description thus predicts that @xmath20 is independent of @xmath25 ( and up to 7 orders of magnitude smaller than observed ) and can not describe the data .",
    "two - step tunneling via localized states near the oxide / semiconductor interface can produce an enhanced spin signal due to spin accumulation in those states @xcite , provided that certain conditions are satisfied @xcite . to obtain a spin resistance of 10@xmath0 @xmath1 ,",
    "localized states with a spin lifetime of at least 10 @xmath32 are needed for a reasonable density of interface states ( @xmath33 states@xmath34 ) .",
    "while this can not be excluded a priori , there exists ample experimental evidence that shows that this mechanism is not the origin of the large spin signals observed , as recently reviewed @xcite .",
    "the scaling data presented here provides additional and conclusive proof that two - step tunneling via interface states can not be responsible , as it leads to a fundamental inconsistency .",
    "the scaling of the contact resistance with oxide thickness ( fig .",
    "2a ) implies that the resistance is dominated by the oxide tunnel barrier , and that any resistance @xmath35 of the schottky barrier in the semiconductor is much smaller . for two - step tunneling",
    ", the effective spin resistance @xmath36 of the interface states can not be larger than the resistance @xmath35 that couples the states to the bulk semiconductor @xcite .",
    "taken together this would mean @xmath37 .",
    "however , in order to obtain a scaling of the spin ra with tunnel resistance ( due to back flow from the interface states into the ferromagnet ) , one needs the opposite , namely , @xmath38 .",
    "these requirements can not be satisfied simultaneously , whatever the parameters chosen .",
    "thus , tran s model @xcite for spin accumulation in interface states is inconsistent with the simultaneous exponential scaling of contact resistance and spin signal with tunnel barrier thickness .",
    "the model introduced by tran et al .",
    "@xcite for two - step tunneling via localized states assumes that _ all _ the current goes via the localized states and , as just noted , this can not describe the experimental data .",
    "however , tran s model has recently been extended @xcite by including charge and spin transport by direct tunneling , in parallel with two - step tunneling .",
    "it is therefore important to examine whether this extended transport model can describe the experimental data .",
    "depending on the details of the system , the spin accumulation created in localized states due to two - step tunneling can be much larger than that induced in the semiconductor bands by direct tunneling .",
    "if as a function of some parameter ( e.g. the tunnel barrier thickness ) the relative contribution of two - step and direct tunneling is changed , then a transition from a small signal ( direct tunneling dominant ) to a large signal ( two - step tunneling dominant ) or vice versa , can be produced . in this paragraph",
    "we examine whether this can explain the observed scaling of the spin ra product with tunnel barrier thickness , and show that this is not possible .",
    "+ we start by attempting to fit the experimental data for the p - type si / mgo / fe devices by setting the direct tunnel current to zero . that is , we consider transport by two - step tunneling , where the first step is by tunneling across the mgo from ferromagnet into interface states , and the second step is by tunneling through the schottky barrier from interface states into the bulk semiconductor .",
    "the result is shown in the left two panels of fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] , for which the spin resistance of the localized states was set to infinity , so that the spin signal is not limited by spin relaxation in the localized states . a good fit ( thick solid lines )",
    "is obtained for the junction resistance .",
    "for small mgo thickness , the junction resistance is limited by the resistance of the schottky barrier , whereas at large mgo thickness it is limited by tunneling across the mgo . according to the model ,",
    "this should be accompanied by a transition in the behavior of the spin ra product , which first increases with mgo thickness , but becomes constant as soon as the junction resistance is determined by the mgo .",
    "this corroborates the statement made in the previous paragraph that the junction resistance and spin resistance can not simultaneously exhibit a scaling with mgo thickness if transport is by two - step tunneling via localized interface states .",
    "note that in the regime of small mgo thickness , the magnitude of the spin signal is determined by the tunnel spin polarization @xmath28 associated with the fe / mgo interface , and a value of 20% is needed to obtain a match with the data in this regime . with a value of 75% , which is more reasonable @xcite ,",
    "the data can not be described , not even in the regime of small mgo thickness .",
    "+     the two middle panels show the result if transport is purely by direct tunneling , setting the two - step tunnel current to zero . in principle",
    "the data can be described , however , the required spin resistance @xmath39 of the silicon is of the order of 10@xmath40 @xmath41m@xmath42 .",
    "this is unreasonable considering that is expected to be in the range of 10 - 100 @xmath41m@xmath42 at best , for which one would obtain a spin ra product that is independent of the tunnel oxide thickness and orders of magnitude smaller than experimentally observed .",
    "+ next , we attempt to describe the data by direct and two - step tunneling in parallel , using the equations given in ref . .",
    "as already eluded to above , in order to obtain an increase of the spin ra product as a function of mgo thickness , one needs to have a transition from transport dominated by direct tunneling to transport dominated by two - step tunneling via interface states .",
    "such a situation is depicted in the two right panels of fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] . at large mgo",
    "thickness , transport is determined by tunneling across the mgo , and we have chosen the parameters such that in this regime the resistance associated with two - step tunneling is smaller than that for direct tunneling . at small mgo thickness , the two - step tunnel current is limited by the resistance of the schottky barrier . as a result ,",
    "the transport at small mgo thickness is dominated by direct tunneling . this change in transport process",
    "can reasonably well describe the observed scaling of the junction resistance , but not the scaling of the spin signal . a transition from a small spin ra product , governed by direct tunneling , to an enhanced spin ra product due to two - step tunneling",
    "is indeed created , but the model does not reproduce the experimental data . it does not reproduce the observed exponential increase of the spin ra with mgo thickness , and deviates from the data in almost the entire range . we conclude that a transition in transport from direct to two - step tunneling does not describe the experimental data .",
    "it has previously been pointed out that an enlarged spin signal can be produced in three - terminal devices if the tunnel current density is not homogeneous across the contact area @xcite . in that case the local current density , and thereby the spin accumulation , can be significantly larger than what is expected from the applied current and the lateral dimensions of the tunnel contact . in previous work",
    "@xcite the spin signal was larger than expected by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude and in principle this could be due to lateral inhomogeneity of the tunnel current . however , the new data presented here exhibit a scaling with tunnel barrier resistance that is not readily understandable with an explanation in terms of current inhomogeneity .",
    "moreover , for devices with the thickest tunnel barrier , the observed spin signals are larger than expected by up to 6 orders magnitude , and this can not be explained by inhomogeneous tunnel current .",
    "it would require that all the tunnel current goes via an area that is 10@xmath43 times smaller than the geometric contact area of 100 @xmath16 200 @xmath10m@xmath42 .",
    "this translates into an effective tunnel area of only 100 @xmath16 200 nm@xmath42 or so , which is unreasonable .",
    "we conclude that inhomogeneity of the tunnel current is not responsible for the experimental observations .",
    "the argument used in the previous section to rule out two - step tunneling via localized interface states was based on the assumption that the states are located at the oxide / semiconductor interface , and decoupled from the semiconductor bulk bands by a schottky barrier with resistance @xmath35 . in principle , it is possible that the relevant localized states are present _ within _ the oxide tunnel barrier , and that a large spin accumulation is induced in those states by two - step tunneling . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath35 that couples the localized states to the semiconductor bands is no longer determined by the schottky barrier , but by the resistance of part of the tunnel oxide .",
    "it is known that two - step tunneling is more efficient for states near the center of the tunnel barrier @xcite .",
    "hence , the associated value of @xmath35 is determined by half of the tunnel oxide and would systematically increase with the thickness of the tunnel oxide . depending on the parameters of the system",
    ", this could produce a spin accumulation that increases with tunnel barrier thickness , and thereby a scaling of the spin ra product with tunnel resistance . + in order to exclude this possibility , we fabricated control devices in which the semiconductor is replaced by a non - magnetic metal ( ru ) electrode .",
    "if the large spin ra product originates from spin accumulation in states within the tunnel oxide , the spin accumulation does not depend on the spin resistance of the non - magnetic electrode , and a similarly large spin accumulation should be observed with a ru metal electrode . however , in control devices with the structure fe / mgo / ru , no spin signal could be observed , neither hanle nor inverted hanle ( see fig .",
    "[ figs1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the spin signal does not originate from spin accumulation in localized states in the tunnel oxide .",
    "this control experiment also rules out the recent proposal @xcite of spin accumulation in states localized in the tunnel barrier close to the oxide / ferromagnet interface , in which a large spin accumulation is not expected to exist anyway because the strong coupling with the ferromagnet would easily deplete the spin accumulation .",

    "the absence of any spin signal in the metallic control devices proves the absence of spin accumulation in localized states within the mgo tunnel barrier.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]      given that the experimental data deviates fundamentally from the theory , it is of the utmost importance to convincingly establish that the observed spin signals are genuine and originate from spin accumulation , rather than some kind of measurement artifact .",
    "such potential artifacts can arise from ( anisotropic ) magnetoresistance effects related to the current through the ferromagnetic electrode itself , or from the effect of magnetic fields on charge transport in the semiconductor ( hall voltages etc . ) .",
    "a powerful way to exclude these artifacts is to introduce a thin non - magnetic layer at the interface between the tunnel oxide and the ferromagnet , without removing the ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "the method relies on the extreme interface sensitivity of ( spin - polarized ) tunneling , such that insertion of a thin non - magnetic layer causes the tunnel spin polarization to vanish , and hence the spin accumulation .",

    "no spin signals are observed .",
    "this implies that the signals ( hanle and inverted hanle ) observed in the regular devices ( without the non - magnetic interlayer ) are not due to an artifact but originate from spin - polarized tunneling and the spin accumulation this produces .",

    "it has previously been noted that the magnitude of the spin accumulation signal observed in magnetic tunnel devices on semiconductors is significantly different than that predicted by the theory of spin injection , diffusion and detection , first for gaas based devices @xcite , and subsequently also for si and ge based devices @xcite .",
    "the results presented here provide an even larger discrepancy ( of up to 7 orders of magnitude ) , and perhaps more importantly , reveal that the scaling with tunnel barrier resistance deviates universally from theory in a fundamental way .",
    "the scaling extends over a wide range of tunnel resistance , down to the lowest tunnel ra values of about 10 k@xmath41m@xmath42 .",
    "it would certainly be of interest to extend the measurements to devices with even lower tunnel resistance .",
    "although it was recently proposed that ferromagnetic tunnel contacts on si with a single layer of graphene as the tunnel barrier may be ideal for this purpose @xcite , the obtained tunnel ra product ( 6 k@xmath41m@xmath42 ) was not much different from what was already achievable with oxide tunnel contacts .",
    "for instance , in silicon - based non - local devices , fe / mgo contacts with a tunnel ra product of 4.6 k@xmath41m@xmath42 have been successfully used for spin injection and detection by suzuki et al .",
    "however , unlike the case of graphene , the oxide tunnel barriers can still be made thinner and thus appear more promising to reach even lower ra product .",
    "+ our results reveal that care has to be taken when in a particular device the observed magnitude of the spin signal is found to be in agreement with theory , because this could be accidental . for instance",
    ", the scaling trend predicts that at small junction ra product there must be a point where experiment and theory are in agreement , but a more detailed investigation varying the tunnel barrier thickness would reveal a discrepancy .",
    "this point of `` accidental agreement '' will shift to larger junction ra product when the thickness of the semiconductor channel is reduced , because the theory predicts a larger spin signal when the volume of semiconductor into which spins are injected is decreased .",
    "an experiment to explicitly confirm the predicted enhancement ( for instance by studying devices with different channel thickness ) would be helpful , but is still lacking .",
    "clearly , one needs to look beyond the magnitude of the spin signal in order to ( in)validate the theory .",
    "+ while the above results are obtained with three - terminal devices and the observed signal is larger than predicted , in silicon - based non - local devices @xcite the observed signal deviates in the opposite direction , i.e. , it is about two orders of magnitude smaller than expected , as recently noted @xcite .",
    "although in the latter case there can be several other reasons , the results presented here suggest that the difference between experiment and theory in three - terminal and non - local devices has a common origin , namely , a missing ingredient in the existing theoretical descriptions .",
    "several explanations for the discrepancy had so far been proposed .",
    "these include two - step tunneling via localized states near the semiconductor / oxide interface @xcite , lateral inhomogeneity of the tunnel current density @xcite , two - step tunneling in parallel with direct tunneling @xcite , or two - step tunneling via localized states near the oxide / ferromagnet interface @xcite .",
    "the scaling results presented here , together with the control experiments , show unambiguously that none of these proposals can explain the results .",
    "it is unclear whether the discrepancy arises from an incorrect description of the magnitude of the spin accumulation that is induced by spin injection , or from the description of the conversion of the induced spin accumulation into a voltage signal in a hanle measurement . obviously , resolving this puzzle is of crucial importance for application of magnetic tunnel contacts in semiconductor spintronic devices .",
    "the authors are grateful to t. nozaki for his help with the growth of the ru - based control devices .",
    "the authors acknowledge financial support from the netherlands foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) , and from the japanese funding program for next generation world - leading researchers ( no .",
    "one of the authors ( a.s . ) acknowledges a jsps postdoctoral fellowship for foreign researchers .",
    "to investigate the effect of localized states produced by oxygen vacancies within the oxide tunnel barrier , we fabricated devices with p - type si and al@xmath13o@xmath14 tunnel barrier , but without the plasma oxidation step .",
    "since the al@xmath13o@xmath14 is grown by electron - beam deposition , the deposited oxide is oxygen deficient .",
    "we found that there is no effect on the spin signal , i.e. , junctions with and without the plasma oxidation have the same spin ra product at the same tunnel resistance ( fig .",
    "[ figs3 ] , left panel ) .",
    "this suggests that two - step tunneling via localized states within the tunnel barrier plays no major role in the spin transport , consistent with the result of the control devices with ru metal .",
    "+ in order to investigate the effect of the resistance @xmath35 of the depletion region in the si , the schottky barrier height was reduced ( and with it @xmath35 ) using the procedure with a cs treatment of the si surface that was previously developed @xcite . here",
    "we present similar data as in ref . for n - type si / al@xmath13o@xmath14/ni@xmath7fe@xmath8 devices with and without cs , but now as a function of tunnel barrier thickness ( fig .",
    "[ figs3 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the cs treatment produces no change of the spin ra product , and it scales to values of 10@xmath43 @xmath45m@xmath42 .",
    "this is not compatible with a description in terms of two - step tunneling via localized states at the oxide / si interface .",
    "owing to the small value of @xmath35 for the devices treated with cs , a large spin accumulation can not built up in the interface states because spins will leak away efficiently into the silicon .",
    "fig . [ figs5 ] shows that the effective spin lifetime , extracted from the width of the hanle curves , increases as a function of the tunnel resistance . for devices with an al@xmath13o@xmath14 tunnel barrier ,",
    "the line width is slightly dependent on the oxidation time .",
    "the spin lifetime for devices with mgo / fe contacts is smaller than with al@xmath13o@xmath14/ni@xmath7fe@xmath8 contacts .",
    "this is attributed to broadening of the hanle curve by inhomogeneous magnetostatic fields , which is more pronounced for fe owing to its larger magnetization @xcite ."
