    "quantum entanglement plays a central role in quantum theory from a conceptual as well as a practical point of view . on the conceptual front",
    ", entanglement is intimately connected with the notions of non - locality and violation of bell s inequalities , which lie at the heart of the way the quantum mechanical description of the world differs from the classical one . on the practical front ,",
    "quantum entanglement is essential in providing a computational advantage to quantum computers over their classical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the quantum state of a physical system with a finite - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath0 ( which is either pure or mixed ) , is represented by @xmath1 which is a positive semi - definite hermitian operator with unit trace .",
    "the set of states forms a convex set and the extremal points of this set are pure states which are operators of rank 1 .    for composite quantum systems , the hilbert space is the tensor product of hilbert spaces of the individual systems .",
    "consider a bipartite quantum system with its state space given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the hilbert spaces of individual quantum system .",
    "a bipartite state @xmath5 is said to be separable if it is possible to decompose it as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are states in systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "a bipartite state @xmath11 is said to be entangled if it is not separable i.e. it can not be expanded in the form given in equation  ( [ separable ] ) .    for pure quantum states ,",
    "the characterization of states as separable or entangled , is easily achieved by computing the entropy of the reduced density operator of the subsystems .",
    "however , such a characterization for mixed states is a non - trivial problem .",
    "while a large volume of work has appeared on this issue in the past two decades , the problem still remains open . in the absence of a `` final solution '' , explorations into finding new classes of mixed entangled states and new ways of constructing them , is useful and provides insights into the classification problem .    an important method to detect the entanglement of quantum states",
    "is to construct entanglement witnesses , which are positive maps that are not completely positive @xcite . consider a positive map @xmath12 defined on the hilbert space @xmath3 of system @xmath9",
    ". if this map is not completely positive , then for some @xmath4 the map @xmath13 acting on @xmath2 will not be positive .",
    "therefore , there will be a state @xmath14 for which @xmath15 will be negative . however , this can not happen for a separable state defined in  ( [ separable ] ) .",
    "therefore , such a @xmath14 has to be entangled .",
    "partial transposition was the first such entanglement witness which was used to unearth the entanglement of pure as well as mixed states @xcite .",
    "while negativity under partial transpose ( npt ) indicates entanglement , positivity under partial transpose is both necessary and sufficient only for @xmath16 and @xmath17 systems . the proof relied on the earlier works of woronowicz  @xcite , arvison  @xcite and strmer  @xcite where they show that in dimension 2 , all positive but not completely positive maps are decomposable ( can be written as a combination of a completely positive map and a transposed completely positive map ) .",
    "a corollary of their result shows that , for dimensions @xmath16 and @xmath18 , a state is separable if and only if it remains positive under partial transpose .",
    "however in higher dimensions there could be maps which are positive but not completely positive and which may not have a connection with partial transpose .",
    "this means that there could be states which are positive under partial transpose ( ppt ) and are still entangled .",
    "such states are called ppt entangled states . obviously for such states",
    ", there exists a positive but not completely positive map revealing their entanglement  @xcite .",
    "choi provided the first example of an indecomposable map which later led to the detection of entangled states beyond partial transpose  @xcite . a number of other discrete examples are also available @xcite .",
    "however there is no systematic way of characterizing such maps beyond two dimensions .",
    "a few methods have been recently suggested for generating examples of positive maps which are not completely positive @xcite . however , there is no straight forward procedure to verify if they are indecomposable or not .",
    "generalizations of choi s method have also been adopted to produce indecomposable maps which in principle have the potential to reveal entanglement of new quantum states  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is an attempt in this direction , where we have constructed extremal extensions of known entanglement witnesses in order to unearth new classes of bound entangled states .",
    "we have constructed examples of ppt entangled states which are revealed by extremal choi type maps considered by choi and lam @xcite , and later by osaka@xcite , and have exploited the cholesky decomposition in a nontrivial way .",
    "the cholesky decomposition has been used by chruciski et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of ppt states ; however our analysis goes much beyond that .",
    "moreover , given any extremal positive but not completely positive map , we can use our method to generate new classes of extremal maps .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath19 bipartite system , we have constructed ppt states whose entanglement is revealed by our map but is not revealed by choi s map .",
    "for the positive maps which are not completely positive , the question of extremality has been settled only for a few maps and the problem of determining the structure of such maps and their extremal or non - extremal nature is in general difficult . in this regard ,",
    "we believe that our generalization adds new insights into the class of extremal entangled witnesses .",
    "further , for a given map which is positive but not completely positive , it is not always trivial to find the ppt entangled states revealed by the map . in our case",
    "we were able to find a family of such states .",
    "the material in this paper is arranged as follows : in section  [ section_2 ] we discuss the bi - quadratic forms and their connection with positive maps , where the notions of extremality and decomposability are discussed as important ingredients for the purpose of classification of entangled states . in section  [ section_3 ]",
    "we explore the possibility of extremal extensions of choi s map .",
    "we present osaka s map as an extremal extension of choi s map and go on to construct other extremal extensions .",
    "we then turn to constructing examples of bound entangled states whose entanglement is revealed by osaka s map and by our new extremal extension of choi s map . at the end of this section we show that the bound entangled states that we have constructed are robust and can take a certain amount of noise before they lose their entanglement .",
    "section  [ section_4 ] offers some concluding remarks .",
    "given a non - negative polynomial @xmath20 of degree @xmath21 , the question whether @xmath22 can always be written as a sum of squares of polynomials has been around for a long time .",
    "minkowski conjectured that in general the answer should be ` no ' .",
    "it was proved by hilbert that , except for three exceptional cases ( @xmath23 , @xmath21 arbitrary ; @xmath24 arbitrary , @xmath25 ; and one non - trivial case @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , there always exist positive semi - definite polynomials which can not be written as a sum of squares of polynomials .",
    "however , his proof was by an indirect method and did not provide actual examples of such polynomials . for a survey and development of the problem ,",
    "see rudin  @xcite .",
    "the generalized version of this problem on rational polynomials , is known as hilbert s 17th problem , and for which the answer is ` yes ' .",
    "the first counterexample was constructed by choi @xcite where he considered a positive semi - definite bi - quadratic form @xmath28 ( each term having degree four ) , with six variables , divided into two sets denoted by @xmath29 , and @xmath30 given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "choi proved that for @xmath33 , this bi - quadratic form is non - negative definite but can not be written as a sum of squares of quadratic forms @xcite .",
    "later it was shown by choi and lam @xcite that it is also true for @xmath34 .",
    "choi s method has been modified and extended , and different examples of such positive semi - definite bi - quadratic forms were found . among these ,",
    "the results by osaka  @xcite , cho et .",
    "@xcite , and ha  @xcite are important .",
    "later generalizations of these methods for generating such forms in arbitrary dimensions were developed by chruciski and kossakowski  @xcite .",
    "the intimate connection between a positive map and positive semi - definite bi - quadratic forms was also discovered by choi @xcite . before describing the connection we provide a few definitions .",
    "* definition  :  * a hermiticity preserving map @xmath35 , is said to be a positive map , if it maps positive semi- definite operators to positive semi - definite operators . here",
    "@xmath36 denotes the set of all @xmath37 complex matrices .    *",
    "definition  :  * a positive map @xmath38 is said to be @xmath39-positive if the extended map @xmath40 is positive , we here @xmath41 denotes the identity mapping on the auxiliary space @xmath42 .",
    "the map @xmath38 is said to be completely positive if the above extensions are positive for all @xmath43 .",
    "the connection between the maps and bi - quadratic forms can be established as follows .",
    "consider a hermiticity preserving linear map @xmath44 we can construct the corresponding bi - quadratic form @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    on the other hand , let @xmath45 be a bi - quadratic form .",
    "notice that , it is a quadratic form with respect to @xmath49 ( as well as @xmath50 ) . so we can write it in the form @xmath51 .",
    "thus we get a map which takes any one - dimensional projection @xmath52 to @xmath53 . using linearity and hermiticity ,",
    "we can extend it to a map which preserves hermiticity .",
    "it was shown by choi that , given any positive semi - definite form , the corresponding map is a positive map and vice - versa @xcite",
    ".    there is thus a bijective relation between the set of positive semi - definite forms and positive maps between matrix algebras .",
    "the property of complete positivity can also be translated easily .",
    "if a map is completely positive , the corresponding bi - quadratic form can be written as a sum of squares of quadratic forms and vice versa .",
    "put differently , if a map is positive but not completely positive , the corresponding bi - quadratic form will be positive semi - definite but can not be written as a sum of squares of quadratic forms .",
    "thus each such form gives rise to a unique map between the space of real symmetric operators , which can be trivially extended to the set of all hermitian operators , and then to all operators .",
    "this also connects with the work of arvison  @xcite and strmer  @xcite who were exploring the set of positive maps between @xmath54-algebras .",
    "since then , other examples and classes of such maps have been discovered .    by the above correspondence ,",
    "the choi quadratic form given in equation  ( [ form ] ) leads to the following map for @xmath55 matrices . @xmath56    with @xmath32 .",
    "from the quadratic form  ( [ form ] ) , exchanging the @xmath50 and @xmath49 variables , we can get another map , which is given by    @xmath57    our interest in these positive but not completely positive maps is because of their ability to detect entanglement of quantum states .",
    "for the maps that are to be used as entanglement witnesses , two notions , namely decomposability and extremality are very important .",
    "we define these notions below .    * definition  :  * a positive but not completely positive map is called decomposable , if it can be written as a sum of a completely positive and a completely co - positive map .",
    "this property was first discussed by woronowicz @xcite . since",
    "decomposable maps are obtained by combining a completely positive map with a transposed completely positive map , it is clear that they are weaker than partial transpose in terms of their ability to detect entanglement and therefore are not of interest .",
    "the interesting point however is that , given a map which is positive but not completely positive , there is no standard way to check if it is decomposable or not !    since the set of positive maps is a convex set it can be described by its extremal elements .",
    "therefore , it is most natural to study extremal positive maps . from the point of view of detecting entanglement ,",
    "any extremal map is more powerful than the maps which are internal points of the set of positive maps  @xcite .",
    "choi and lam define an extremal map using the corresponding bi - quadratic form  @xcite as follows .",
    "* definition  :  * a positive semi - definite bi - quadratic form @xmath58 is said to be extremal if , for any decomposition of @xmath59 where @xmath60 s are positive semi - definite bi - quadratic forms , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are non - negative real numbers with @xmath63 .",
    "it was shown by choi and lam that in the case @xmath34 , the form @xmath64 defined in equation  ( [ form ] ) is extremal .",
    "since the set of positive semi - definite forms is a convex set , it is enough to identify the set of such extremal forms . at this stage",
    "it is useful to change the notation to the original choi - lam notation for the bi - quadratic forms and we therefore denote @xmath45 as @xmath65 .",
    "osaka extended the result of choi and lam , and generated a class of extremal maps  @xcite .",
    "osaka s map @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "osaka showed that this class of maps is extremal  @xcite .",
    "generalizing beyond osaka construction , we define a class of extremal bi - quadratic forms as follows :    let @xmath70 be an extremal positive semi - definite bi - quadratic form .    for a set of non - zero positive real numbers",
    "@xmath71 we define @xmath72    it turns out that the form @xmath73 is positive semi - definite and extremal .    * proof  :  * we first prove the positivity .",
    "let us assume that the proposition is not true and there exists real numbers @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "but then by definition @xmath76 ; for a set of real numbers @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that @xmath58 is a positive semi - definite form for all real values of @xmath80 s and @xmath81 s .    for extremality ,",
    "let us assume @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are positive semi - definite bi - quadratic forms .",
    "notice that @xmath85 as we have assumed .",
    "define two positive semi - definite forms @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "we can now write , @xmath88 however , @xmath58 is extremal",
    ". therefore , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are positive real numbers with @xmath63 . thus @xmath92 .",
    "hence @xmath93 since @xmath94 and @xmath63 ; the form @xmath95 is an extremal form .",
    "the maps corresponding to the bi - quadratic form @xmath95 defined above are positive maps which are extremal",
    ". this construction is extendable to higher dimensions without any further work .",
    "this means that given any extremal positive semi - definite bi - quadratic form , @xmath96 , for any non zero positive real @xmath97 ; @xmath98 is positive semi - definite and extremal .",

    "<S> in this paper , we discuss extremal extensions of entanglement witnesses based on choi s map . </S>",
    "<S> the constructions are based on a generalization of the choi map due to osaka , from which we construct entanglement witnesses . </S>",
    "<S> these extremal extensions are powerful in terms of their capacity to detect entanglement of positive under partial transpose ( ppt ) entangled states and lead to unearthing of entanglement of new ppt states . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the cholesky - like decomposition to construct entangled states which are revealed by these extremal entanglement witnesses . </S>"
