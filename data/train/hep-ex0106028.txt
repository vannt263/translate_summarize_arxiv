    "the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) at beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) , so far the only @xmath6 machine operating in the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy from 2 - 5 gev and directly producing charmonium and charmed mesons , has been running for 12 years . both bepc and bes were upgraded from 1995 to 1997 , and the upgraded bes is called besii  @xcite .",
    "currently the bes experiment is benefiting from the upgraded machine and detector , though some of the detector and machine parts are suffering aging problems seriously .",
