    "in the preceding paper , denoted as hr @xcite , we discussed the collision dynamics of an elastic three - particle system on a finite interval that consists of a massive particle  a piston  that separates two lighter particles .",
    "the motivation for studying this idealized system was to shed light on the enigmatic piston problem @xcite , where a gas - filled container is divided into two compartments by a heavy but freely moving piston . when the gases in each compartment have different initial thermodynamic states and when the piston moves without friction , the approach to equilibrium is unexpectedly complex and still incompletely understood @xcite .",
    "as discussed in hr , some of the rich phenomenology of the piston problem can be captured by the much simpler three - particle system in a finite interval . to understand the evolution of the latter system , it proved convenient to map the trajectories of the 3 particles on the line onto an equivalent elastic billiard particle that moves within a highly skewed tetrahedral region , with the specular reflection whenever the billiard hits the tetrahedron boundaries @xcite . from this simple geometrical mapping",
    ", we deduced several anomalous dynamical properties of the three - particle system , such as the power - law distribution of time intervals for the piston to make successive crossings of the interval midpoint .    in the inelastic piston problem ,",
    "the collisions between the constituent particles in the gas are inelastic , so that each gas undergoes inelastic collapse if either the number of particles is sufficiently large or the restitution coefficient is sufficiently small .",
    "recent work by brito _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite has again discovered surprisingly rich dynamics , very different in character from the elastic case , in which one of the gases cools more quickly and gets compressed into a solid by the piston .",
    "an even stranger feature is that this compression is not monotonic , but rather the piston has superimposed oscillations whose period grows exponentially with time .",
    "thus the cooling of the inelastic piston problem is much richer than that of the classical inelastic gas problem @xcite .",
    "given the complex behavior exhibited by the many - body piston system , we are again led to investigate a simpler alternative : a three - particle system in the unit interval that contains a heavy piston that lies between two light particles .",
    "collisions between light particles and the ends of the interval ( henceforth termed walls ) are inelastic , to mimic the many - particle piston problem when the gases are inelastic , while the collisions between the particles and the piston are elastic .    when the light particles have the same initial energy but nonsymmetric positions , one light particle loses energy more quickly than the other .",
    "as a consequence , the piston migrates to the wall that is closer to the cooler light particle .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , a typical system eventually falls into a periodic state on a logarithmic time scale where the piston undergoes small - amplitude oscillations near one wall with a constant period in @xmath0 , while the light particles undergo complementary oscillatory motions .",
    "we term this phenomenon as the log - periodic state .",
    "another intriguing aspect of the three - particle system is that it closely mirrors the time evolution in the many - particle inelastic piston system @xcite .",
    "thus we are able to understand features of the many - body problem in terms of simple physical pictures that arise from studying the three - particle system on the interval .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the two basic dynamical features of the three - particle system , namely , the initial symmetry breaking and the log - periodic state .",
    "we then give a macroscopic description of the collapse process and the subsequent oscillatory motion of the piston in sec .",
    "iii . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we develop an effective restitution coefficient description for the particle collisions that accounts for many of our observations .",
    "various calculational details are given in an appendix .",
    "for the many - body system in which the gases on either side of the piston are inelastic and have identical macroscopic initial conditions , brito _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found an instability in which one of the gases cools more rapidly and the piston ultimately compresses the cooler gas into a solid .",
    "while such an instability seems intuitively plausible , an unexpected feature is that the piston moves nonmonotonically during this cooling , with regular oscillations that are periodic on a logarithmic time scale . in this section ,",
    "we show that much of this phenomenology also arises in the idealized three - particle system on the unit interval .",
    "the particles are located at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "the light particles , with masses @xmath5 and locations @xmath1 and @xmath3 , collide elastically with a massive piston with mass @xmath6 at @xmath2 and inelastically with the walls .",

    "this fact leads to the piston eventually compressing the particle that experiences the first collision with a wall .",
