    "titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath6 ) has a history of applications since the early 19th century . although its initial usage was confined to use as a white pigment , its applications diversified over the course of the last few decades , including but not limited to biological implants , photocatalysis and dye - sensitized solar cells ( dsscs ) , based on the refractive , biocompatible , photocatalytic and photoelectric properties of the material @xcite .",
    "recent emphasis on the latter applications spurred research work in the surface properties and reactions of crystalline tio@xmath6 , understanding of which is crucial in their realization .",
    "in the case of dsscs , this often involves the interactions of these surfaces with sensitizing dyes , such as triscarboxy - ruthenium terpyridine [ ru(4,4,4-(cooh)@xmath7-terpy)(ncs)@xmath7 ] , the `` black dye '' .",
    "recent developments have also been made in bio - sensitized solar cells ( bsscs)@xcite , which are similar to dsscs in operating principles , but with the synthetic dye often used in the latter replaced by one that is biologically derived .",
    "one class of such biomolecules are the cyclic tetrapyrroles , which encompass porphyrins and chlorins .",
    "many of such compounds contain a ring structure , with one or more carboxylic functional groups which play importance roles in anchoring the dye to the tio@xmath6 surfaces , benzoic acid s adsorption on tio@xmath6 can thus offer an exemplar case study for how this entire class of compounds can interact with tio@xmath6 surfaces .    out of all the tio@xmath6 surfaces ,",
    "the rutile @xmath0 is the most energetically stable and naturally occurring , and thus forms the substrate surface of choice in such adsorption studies .",
    "the rutile @xmath0 surface , though not prone to reconstruction , can undergo @xmath1 reconstruction upon annealing under uhv conditions , with the models proposed including added ti@xmath6o@xmath7 and ti@xmath7o@xmath9 rows .",
    "as such , the focus of our studies shall be on the adsorption of benzoic acid on these two types of rutile @xmath0 surfaces , in terms of the binding mode and the overlayer patterns .",
    "experimental studies have been performed on such adsorptions , using leed , esdiad and stm by guo et al @xcite , and later by grinter et al using stm @xcite . in guo",
    "s studies , the optimal adsorption mode observed was in line with those of other small carboxylates i.e. dissociative bidentate bridging binding ( bb ) , involving the two carboxyl o atoms , after deprotonation on one of them , binding to two neighbouring five - coordinated ti sites ( ti@xmath2 ) along the @xmath10 $ ] rows of such sites .    in terms of adsorption patterns , through leed@xcite , it was also observed that a p@xmath11 pattern was formed .",
    "when studied using stm however , a different picture emerged , as a p@xmath12 pattern was observed instead .",
    "such discrepancy could be accounted for by the fact that leed is a scattering technique dependent upon the charge distribution of the surface , while stm surveys the apex of the surface and the adsorbates , and the fact that the phenyl rings of the benzoates were rotated to align with the @xmath13 $ ] direction to form dimer structures .",
    "the rotation of the phenyl rings and the resultant dimer structures are due to the interactions of the lower phenyl h atoms and the @xmath14 orbital of the neighbouring benzoate , facilitated by the bridging o@xmath15 anions .    building upon these findings ,",
    "a later stm study of these adsorptions was performed@xcite , with the aims of studying orientations of the benzene rings of the adsorbate overlayer , as well as the adsorption of benzoates on the @xmath0-@xmath1 reconstructed surface .",
    "the binding geometry of the acid was once again confirmed , but the elongation of the phenyl rings along the @xmath16 $ ] direction was only significant in the case of the reconstructed surface , due to improved hydrogen bonding of the phenyl h atoms to the surface o atoms as a result of closer proximity .",
    "there was also no formation of dimer structures at high coverages as reported in the much earlier study - which could be due to the higher dosing temperature used this time , nor was there any observation of adsorption of dissociated h@xmath17 ions . on the @xmath0-@xmath1 reconstructed surface",
    ", it was also observed that benzoic acid adsorbs and binds the same way as on the unreconstructed surface .",
    "although dft studies of the adsorption of benzoic acid on the rutile @xmath0 surface had been performed by troisi et al @xcite , these were performed with the aim of comparing the effects of using different dft implementations on the computed results on electronic structures of such benzoate - tio@xmath6 complexes , rather than the physical structure of the adsorbates on the surface which forms the main theme of experimental research work . in our work",
    ", we will expand upon this topic by investigating the proposed models for surface adsorbate structures and patterns described in the experimental work , using dft as implemented through vasp . after presenting our methodology",
    ", we calculate and compare the energetics of these configurations obtained using lda , gga and vdw , as well as producing high resolution simulated stm images to provide comparisons with these results , before concluding .",
    "our dft investigations were carried out using the vienna ab initio simulations package ( vasp)@xcite@xcite . out of all the elemental pseudopotential files , oxygen has the highest @xmath18 value at 395.700  ev , hence this value was chosen as the cut - off energy @xmath18 in all our simulations .",
    "iterative electronic relaxations are done such that energy differences ( @xmath19 ) between two successive steps should not exceed @xmath20  ev , while relaxations are said to be achieved when the rms force on each atom falls below @xmath21  ev /  .    in our calculations , lda , gga(pbe ) and",
    "gga+dft - d2-based methods were used to give three different sets of results for comparison of the effects of hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces , as gga and dft - d2 methods can account for these forces much better , as the interactions as a result of these forces were implied in the experimental stm studies @xcite .    in order to simulate the rutile tio@xmath6 substrate , an 8 ti layer slab terminated by two @xmath0 surfaces on each end was chosen , as studies of the rutile @xmath0 surface through dft have revealed that surface energies converge at around this thickness @xcite .",
    "this was done after performing bulk relaxation of the rutile crystal , where k - sampling values of @xmath22 were used , in order to reflect the approximate inverse ratio of the dimensions of the real space unit cell .",
    "the optimized lattice constants obtained through lda calculations were found to be @xmath23 and @xmath24 for rutile , reflecting a contractions of @xmath21    to @xmath25    from the experimental values , which are expected for dft using lda as reported in other research literature , as well as being within @xmath26 error margin @xcite . as for gga based calculations ,",
    "the optimized lattice constants were @xmath27 and @xmath28 , representing an expansion of 0.04   , which is expected due to gga s underestimation of cohesive energies of insulators .",
    "the new lattice parameters were then used to set up the slabs for surface relaxations .",
    "8 ti layer slabs were set up using four such cells with the terminated ends autocompensated . for the @xmath1-reconstructed surface , we used the ti@xmath7o@xmath9 added - row structure as assumed in @xcite .",
    "we then set the benzoates up such that they correspond to the following six configurations , which involve the phenyl rings being aligned either with the @xmath10 $ ] direction(denoted @xmath29 ) or the @xmath16 $ ] direction ( denoted @xmath30 ) , as well as being aligned such that they form @xmath4-periodic patterns ( denoted @xmath31 ) , or with the neighbouring @xmath10$]-rows of benzoates aligned one ti@xmath2 step out with respect to each other ( denoted @xmath32 ) .",
    "the different monolayer patterns are denoted as follows , with the relaxed gga structures shown in the relevant figures ( lda and gga relaxed structures show little different ) :    * bb@xmath33 : phenyl rings of the benzoates are aligned with the @xmath10 $ ] direction , with the benzoates of neighbouring @xmath10 $ ] rows in step with each other , as seen in figure [ paraingga ] * bb@xmath34 : phenyl rings of the benzoates are aligned with the @xmath10 $ ] direction , with the benzoates of neighbouring @xmath10 $ ] one ti@xmath2 site out of step with each other , as seen in figure [ perpingga ] * bb@xmath35 : phenyl rings of the benzoates are perpendicular to the @xmath10 $ ] direction , with the benzoates of neighbouring @xmath10 $ ] rows in step with each other , as seen in figure [ paraoutgga ] * bb@xmath36 : phenyl rings of the benzoates are perpendicular to the @xmath10 $ ] direction , with the benzoates of neighbouring @xmath10 $ ] one ti@xmath2 site out of step with each other , as seen in figure [ perpoutgga ] * bb@xmath37 : phenyl rings of the benzoates are aligned with the @xmath10 $ ] direction , using the @xmath1-reconstructed @xmath0 surface instead , as seen in figure [ pararecongga ] * bb@xmath38 : phenyl rings of the benzoates are perpendicular to the @xmath10 $ ] direction , using the @xmath1-reconstructed @xmath0 surface instead , as seen in figure [ perprecongga ]    these collections of atoms are padded by  15    of vacuum between the topmost and the bottom - most atoms of the vertically adjacent simulation cells , in order to ensure lack of interaction between the atoms of these cells . to calculate the adsorption energies ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "the energies of three simulation cells of the above defined dimensions , consisting of the slab and the adsorbate ( @xmath40 ) , just the slab ( @xmath41 ) and just the adsorbate ( @xmath42 ) in neutral form respectively , were first calculated , obtaining @xmath39 by :    @xmath43    as the latest stm studies @xcite did not report h adsorption on the protruding bridging o@xmath15s , these simulations were also run with the dissociated h removed , with stabilities of each mode compared in terms of the total energy of the simulation cell @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , the ionic adsorption energies of @xmath45 the different modes will be compared against one another , in a similar fashion to , with @xmath46 being replaced by that corresponding to the energy of a single benzoate anion in the simulation cell .",
    "this gives us completeness in the comparisons for adsorption energies .    upon relaxations of these different modes of adsorptions under the above described set ups , simulated stm images",
    "were then generated based on the electronic structures of the relaxed adsorbate - surface complex , at a bias voltage of + 1.5v .",
    "for the adsorption structures , the optimized structures for the six bb modes corresponded largely with the models proposed for the stm images @xcite , in that the carboxylate group remained anchored via two ti@xmath2-o@xmath47 bonds , while the benzene rings remained aligned more or less along the @xmath10 $ ] and the @xmath16 $ ] directions .",
    "slight deviations were observed in the bb@xmath48 and the bb@xmath37 modes , in that the benzene rings were not exactly aligned along the @xmath10 $ ] directions and instead being slightly rotated about the @xmath49 $ ] axis .",
    "in addition to the slight rotations , in all of the bb@xmath29 modes , the benzene rings underwent slight planar rotations about the @xmath16 $ ] axis .",
    "these are likely due to the sideways repulsions between the h atoms on the benzene rings .    in terms of adsorption energetics , the adsorption energies ( @xmath39 )",
    "were obtained ( with the values obtained through gga calculations ) as displayed in table [ dissads ] . when the dissociated hs were removed , ionic adsorption energies ( @xmath45 )",
    "were obtained and presented in table [ ionads ] .",
    ".adsorption energies for dissociative adsorptions of benzoic acid on the rutile @xmath0 surface , in  ev /  , as calculated through lda , with and without the co - adsorbed h. [ dissads ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the experimental stm studies , the stm images produced presented the sites of benzoate adsorption as bright spots , elongated along the directions of the alignments of the phenyl rings@xcite , with no direct visual evidence of co - adsorbed hydrogens , except for low coverages on the @xmath1-reconstructed surface .",
    "the simulated stm images produced have replicated the same arrays of bright spots representing the two - dimensional periodities of the benzoate adsorbates ( see figures [ bbipstm ] and [ bbopstm ] ) , while the rutile @xmath0 surface itself has been shown to be dark in comparison to the adsorption sites .    in the limit representing high charge isosurfaces i.e. large currents , the positions and the shapes of the bright regions representing the benzoate adsorption sites were mainly determined by the positioning of the carboxylate groups , rather than the orientations of the benzene rings .",
    "the latter only started to influence the appearances of bright regions when the charge isosurfaces are set at values sufficiently low ( i.e. limits of low currents ) , such that the rutile @xmath0 substrate surface itself loses its distinctive visual features , such as distinct dark regions as shown in figure [ bbipstm](top ) .",
    "where the benzene rings were imaged in the limit of low currents , they appeared either as double rows of trios of bright spots , with the brightest at the centre representing the topmost c atom of the ring in the case of the benzene ring being aligned with the @xmath10 $ ] direction ; or as twin central bright spots accompanied by darker , kidney - shaped spots on either side .",
    "it is also observed while in the limit of high currents where the carboxylate groups were distinctively imaged , positions of the co - adsorbed h can be seen from the differing orbital shapes in the @xmath10 $ ] o@xmath15 rows , with circular - shaped dim spots representing the 1s orbitals of h and dumbell - shaped ones representing the 2p orbitals of the o@xmath15 atoms .    in the bb@xmath50 modes ,",
    "whose simulated stm images are as shown in figure [ bbipstm ] , revealed orientations of rectangular rows of bright spots , with their widths aligned along the planes of the benzene rings determined through dft calculations .",
    "the patterns of the bright spots representing the benzene rings however differed between the bb@xmath51 and the bb@xmath52 modes , with the former as parallel trios of bright spots along the @xmath10$]-direction , and the latter as two central bright spots sandwiched by two larger merged dimmer spots aligned along the @xmath16$]-direction .    in the bb@xmath53 modes , the simulated stm images generated are as shown in figure [ bbopstm ] .",
    "the bright spots representing the @xmath12 overlayer symmetry can be observed in both cases , in agreement with stm results obtained from experimental studies , where such features were observed in some regions alongside the bright dots representing the @xmath4 symmetry on the unrecontructed surface .",
    "the orientations of the bright spots again reflected the orientations of the benzene rings as shown in figures [ paraoutgga ] and [ perpoutgga ] . however , whereas the benzene ring was imaged as duo rows of bright spots in the bb@xmath51 mode , in the bb@xmath52 mode the darker spots around the central bright spots merged , forming kidney - shaped spots .",
    "for the case of bb@xmath54 modes , in both cases the reconstructed ti@xmath6o@xmath7 ridge appeared as large bright bands along the @xmath10 $ ] directions , with features showing the ridges being largely indistinguishable .",
    "again , although the double rows of three bright spots were observed when the ring was aligned along the @xmath10 $ ] direction , the dimmer pairs of spots on the sides of the central bright spots became merged in the case of the benzene ring being aligned with the @xmath16 $ ] direction .",
    "for adsorption energetics , gga and gga+dftd2 simulations have shown the bb@xmath51 to be the most energetically stable out of all the bb modes of adsorptions on the unreconstructed surface , when co - adsorbed with the dissociated hydrogens .",
    "being the most observed pattern in the experimental stm studies of the unreconstructed surface , this is an expected result . in terms of the simulations themselves , this shows that when hydrogen bonding and/or van der waals forces are taken into account , the bb@xmath51 mode is the most stable .",
    "examining the three pairs of bb@xmath29 and bb@xmath30 modes of adsorption , in gga and gga+dftd2-based calculations , it is clear that on the non - reconstructed surface , simulations have shown that for both @xmath1- and @xmath12-symmetric patterns , the bb@xmath29 modes were shown to be more energetically stable in both cases .",
    "these observations , in both the experimental and computational dft studies , can be accounted for by the long distances between the o@xmath15 atoms and the nearest phenyl h atoms when the benzene ring is rotated , making hydrogen bonding between the two too weak to be a significant stablizing factor .    in terms of the @xmath12-symmetric patterns on the rutile @xmath0 surface ,",
    "the bb@xmath55 modes were shown to be more energetically stable through gga and gga+dftd2 calculations .",
    "this again is in line with the experimental observations , which revealed alignment of the benzene rings with the @xmath10 $ ] direction .",
    "the proposed reasons for such observations were again that the nearest distances between the o@xmath15 atoms and the phenyl h atoms being too far apart to make hydrogen bonding a significant stablizing force . in comparison the bb@xmath51 mode , the corresponding bb@xmath55 mode appeared less energetically stable ( see figures [ dissads ] and [ ionads ] ) .",
    "this again agrees with the findings of experimental stm studies , where such patterns were comparatively rare relative to the @xmath11-symmetric patterns .    in the case of the @xmath1-reconstructed rutile @xmath0 surface ,",
    "however , the results of the dft calculations contradict the conclusions reached in the stm studies . in both the cases of gga and gga+dftd2 calculations",
    ", it was the bb@xmath56 configuration that was more energetically stable in all the three pairs of simulations , instead of the @xmath16$]-aligned benzene rings as observed in the experimental stm images .",
    "the likely explanation for this were the asymmetric distortions in the ti@xmath6o@xmath7 reconstruction ridges produced in the optimized structures , with the predicted energetic stablization effects from hydrogen bonding between the o@xmath15 atoms on the reconstructed ridges and the nearest phenyl h being less than predicted .",
    "perhaps the single greatest anomaly in the results lies in the abnormally large ionic adsorption energy values for benzoates on the @xmath57-reconstructed surface - see figure [ dftd2ads ] .",
    "we found that , for the ionic adsorption on the reconstructed surface , the energies appeared to be anomalous .",
    "we include the values for completeness , but are unable to explain their large values , which we will continue to investigate .    in terms of the simulated stm images , the images generated revealed the bright spots corresponding to sites of benzoate adsorption , with the orientations of the rings much more clearly delineated than the experimental stm images do .",
    "the arrays of positions of the bright spots also corresponded to the 2d symmetries of the adsorption monolayers in the bb@xmath50 , bb@xmath53 and bb@xmath54 configurations .",
    "for both the bb@xmath50 and the bb@xmath53 modes , in the limit of sufficiently low valued charge isosurfaces such that the benzene rings start to be imaged distinctively , the co - adsorbed h atoms lose their distinguishability from their surroundings , whereas in the limit of isosurfaces of high charge values , the vacant o@xmath15 sites could be distinguished from the ones bound by dissociated h by the 2p orbitals imaged .",
    "the simulated stm images in the low charge value limits reveal features which are consistent with those observed in the experimental stm images produced of benzoates on the unreconstructed surface , most notably the elongations of the bright regions along the directions of alignments of the benzene rings , as well as the absence of features reflecting the co - adsorption of dissociated h. this suggests that perhaps even if stm images do not directly image the co - adsorbed h ions , it does not mean that such co - adsorption did not take place .    on the reconstructed surfaces , the simulated stm images revealed central bright bands representing the ti@xmath6o@xmath7 reconstructed rows similar to those observed in the experimental stm images , and that no distinguishable features representing co - adsorption of dissociated h ions .",
    "this is however still in agreement with experimental results as co - adsorbed h ions were not imaged at high coverages .",
    "again , the lack of direct visual evidence for co - adsorption of dissociated protons does not necessarily imply complete absence of it .",
    "we have studied the different patterns for the bidentate bridging dissociative adsorption of benzoic acid on both the unreconstructed and @xmath1-reconstructed surfaces through dft methods lda , gga and gga+dftd2 , as implemented through vasp , following both @xmath11 and @xmath12 symmetries . in all the three dft methods studied , both with and without the dissociated h , the bb@xmath51 pattern was invariably found to be the most energetically stable out all the six bb patterns of adsorption .",
    "these results support stm studies @xcite which revealed that on the unreconstructed @xmath0 surface , where the prevalent pattern was that of bb@xmath50 , with the orientation of the benzene rings aligned along the @xmath10 $ ] direction .    in the case of @xmath1-reconstructed surface however , the bb@xmath56 mode was found to be more stable , in contrast to the experimental stm studies results@xcite where the benzene rings were observed to have rotated by 90@xmath58 , with hydrogen bonding between the phenyl hydrogens and the o@xmath15 atoms along the reconstructed ridges being the reason for the stablization of this orientation .    in the case of simulated stm images ,",
    "the same overlayer patterns of bright dots was reproduced for the proposed models , elongations of the bright spots representing the alignments of benzene rings were observed , which were not obvious in the case of experimental stm studies .",
    "these alignments were only deduced by line profiles taken along the @xmath10 $ ] and the @xmath49 $ ] directions in the experimental stm studies . in the different limits of high and low - valued charge isosurfaces ,",
    "the simulated stm images have also revealed the carboxylate and the benzene ring groups respectively , while in experimental stm images , these structures were not clearly distinguished in the bright spots representing the sites of benzoate adsorption .",
