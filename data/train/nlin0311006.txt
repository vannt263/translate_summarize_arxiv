    "when studying deterministic dynamical systems , it has become practice to distinguish between chaotic and ( quasi-)periodic solutions , where chaos has been seen as a novel and strange behavior .",
    "we study a class of dynamical systems , where such a distinction is not useful . depending on control parameters , our systems will either generate stable periodic orbits or they will behave chaotically , but these two types of motion will be essentially indistinguishable from each other both on computers ( due to finite precision ) and in real experiments ( due to weak noises ) .",
    "seasonal variations are a prominent source of slow periodic parameter fluctuations in biological , ecological , geochemical and geophysical systems . but also in many technical and physical situations , slow periodic oscillations of system parameters do occur . speaking of time dependent parameters ,",
    "we imply that there is no feedback from the system under study to the variation of the parameters , whose time dependence can either be considered as given ( non - autonomous situation ) or can be ruled by its own periodic autonomous dynamics .",
    "moreover , we focus on situations where the typical time scales related to the system dynamics for fixed parameters is much faster than the time scale related to the parameter variation , as it is typical of many processes subject to seasonal variations . the opposite case , where both time scales are comparable has been studied as an open loop control mechanism  @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we discuss a scenario , where slow harmonic parameter variations introduce an alternation of expanding and contracting phases .",
    "we will show that ergodic averages can be performed as usual and hence the motion in the long time limit is clearly classified to be either periodic or chaotic .",
    "however , as our analysis will show , in practical applications , chaotic motion will be indistinguishable from periodic motion , both in numerical simulations and in experiments . in the latter case , this is another example of `` stable chaos ''  @xcite .",
    "this indistinguishablility implies a robustness of the phenomenon despite the fact that there are parameter regimes where stable periodic motion and chaos are both supported by a dense set of parameters .",
    "this rather unexpected behavior is shown to exist in numerical experiments of an oscillating flow inside a duct and a dripping faucet with variable liquid supply .",
    "many physical experiments and the corresponding model systems possess solutions which , due to dissipation , relax to rather uninteresting fixed points .",
    "such systems are often exposed to a periodic driving , such as electric resonance circuits .",
    "in particular when the system without driving has a two - dimensional phase space , chaos can only appear with the driving term .",
    "this paper deals with a very different class of driven systems ; we assume that our system without driving can behave chaotically , depending on the values of a control parameter .",
    "this parameter is then varied periodically , with a period which is much longer than the time scale of the internal dynamics on which the auto - correlation function in the chaotic regime would relax , or which would govern the relaxation to a stable fixed point in parameter regimes where it exists .",
    "hence , the temporal dependence of the control parameter has no influence on the short time dynamics of the system , but it causes transitions between different dynamical behaviors which might exist for different values of the control parameter .    in what follows",
    "we choose the quartic map @xmath1 given by @xmath2\\ ] ] with @xmath3 .",
    "this map has the interesting property that for @xmath4 a tangent bifurcation occurs where out of a chaotic region that covers the whole @xmath5 $ ] interval a period one window appears .",
    "however , other maps can be also be considered , for example the logistic map for values of the control parameter near a period 3 window .",
    "imposing a temporal dependence on the control parameter leads us to consider the two dimensional skew autonomous system @xmath6\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is chosen near @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "a small value of @xmath13 leads to a well defined time scale separation between the parameter variation and the dynamics of the system while the choice of @xmath8 and @xmath14 ensures that @xmath15 oscillates from values where the unperturbed map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) is chaotic to values where it has a stable fixed point .    a typical sequence of iterates of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) ( after discarding a transient ) is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_sequence ] .",
    "we see an alternation between irregular fluctuations of @xmath16 and regular episodes due to the oscillating values of @xmath15 shown in the bottom panel .",
    "due to the slowness of the change of @xmath15 , the trajectory can relax toward the stable fixed point for those values of @xmath17 where it exists , whereas it follows an irregular trajectory for @xmath18 , where the map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) is chaotic .",
    "since the @xmath19-dynamics is not mixing , this system clearly has ( at least ) one invariant measure in its two - dimensional phase space for every @xmath20 , on which ergodic averages are well defined .",
    "the jacobi matrix of eq.([eq : logsyst ] ) is triangular , which immediately shows that one lyapunov exponent ( corresponding to the @xmath19-dynamics ) is zero , whereas the other @xmath21 is found as an average over an infinitely long trajectory of the instantaneous stretching factors @xmath22 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : map_sequence ] defined by @xmath23 assuming ergodicity , @xmath24 can also be found as an average of the stretching factor over the invariant measure .",
    "the seemingly intermittent dynamics shown in in the upper panel of fig .  [ fig : map_sequence ] has a well defined non - trivial lyapunov exponent , whose sign depends on the details of the @xmath16-dynamics .",
    "the alternation between unstable and stable phases is different from the typical intermittency scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the stable and unstable phases to the lyapunov exponent have a sensitive and subtle dependence on the choice of @xmath8 and @xmath14 as we show in sec .",
    "[ par - dependence ] .",
    "for the map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) almost any initial condition with @xmath25 , @xmath26 settles after a transient on a fixed point @xmath27 . on the other hand , for @xmath28 , @xmath26 ,",
    "the invariant set is one - dimensional for a dense set of parameter values , but shows type - i intermittency because of the closeness to the tangent bifurcations . for the map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) during one period of the auxiliary variable @xmath29 , the parameter @xmath30 alternates between the periodic and chaotic regime of the map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) and therefore @xmath24 has contributions with negative and positive signs . depending on which contribution has a larger modulus , the overall dynamics is either chaotic or not .",
    "this in turn , depends on the values of @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 .    during the iterates where the trajectory looks regular and is near to @xmath27 , the fixed point of the map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) , the tangent space dynamics is contracting , and we call the accumulated contraction factor @xmath31 . during the iterations when the trajectory looks irregular , its tangent space dynamics is essentially expanding , and we call the accumulated expansion factor @xmath32 .",
    "then , roughly , the lyapunov exponent is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 now denotes the average over successive periods of @xmath19 .",
    "if we start two trajectories with a distance @xmath0 at the beginning of the irregular phase , at its end their distance is @xmath35 .",
    "this distance will shrink during the regular phase , and at its end will be @xmath36 . hence ,",
    "if @xmath37 on average is smaller than unity , two trajectories will approach each other , and finally will be indistinguishable .",
    "this alternation between contracting and expanding episodes is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_sequence ] .",
    "a stable periodic orbit thus is as irregular as a chaotic solution , but its irregular segment repeats itself exactly in every period of oscillation of the parameter @xmath15 , whereas for a trajectory with a positive lyapunov exponent it does not .",
    "hence , this system can create arbitrarily complicated periodic orbits , since by the choice of @xmath13 one can determine the period length and also , how many points of the periodic orbit are in the irregular regime .",
    "when the @xmath29 dynamics is quasi - periodic instead of periodic ( by choosing @xmath38 as an irrational number ) , also orbits with negative lyapunov exponent have non - repeating irregular segments . by visual inspection ,",
    "these can not be distinguished from orbits with a positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "the special dynamics of @xmath29 hinders the 2-dimensional map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) of having a fixed point .",
    "the shortest periodic orbit can have length @xmath38 when @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to study the composition of @xmath38 successive iterates @xmath39 . when the lyapunov exponent of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) is negative , @xmath40 should have a stable periodic orbit or fixed point , whereas it has only unstable periodic orbits and chaotic solutions for positive exponents . in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] we show the graph of @xmath40 for several values of @xmath8 . for @xmath25",
    ", @xmath41 @xmath42 has an almost super - stable fixed point .",
    "these fixed points are generically born and eliminated by tangent bifurcations , together with their unstable counterparts .    for every initial phase @xmath20",
    "we have a different stroboscopic map @xmath42 .",
    "however they are all topologically conjugate . for our choice of the variation of @xmath30 ,",
    "however , the existence or absence of a stable fixed point can best be seen when @xmath43 , where each orbit of the system eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) assumes values close to the fixed point of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) for fixed @xmath45 .",
    "the results described above , and in particular the distinction between motion corresponding to negative and positive lyapunov exponents , is correct only in the abstract mathematical setting . on a computer , the finite precision of the internal representation of real numbers can enforce the motion onto a complex periodic orbit although its lyapunov exponent is positive .",
    "this happens , when the contraction factor @xmath31 during a contracting phase is too strong , so that at the end of this phase the trajectory has no memory of the previous expanding phase . for typical values of @xmath8 and @xmath14",
    "we found numerically that orbits with a positive lyapunov exponent became periodic when the contracting phase contained more than thirty iterates . if these phases are shorter , either because the period @xmath38 is small enough , or because @xmath8 and @xmath14 are chosen to be inside the chaotic regime , orbits with positive lyapunov exponents are non  periodic as expected . hence , with finite precision and large @xmath38 , one can not decide , without computation of the lyapunov exponent , whether the system has a stable periodic orbit or not .    in an experimental realization , instead of computer round - off errors there is external noise coupled into the system .",
    "( [ eq : map ] ) has then to be modified by adding white noise @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this has no visible effect on chaotic solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) , but it does destroy the periodicity of stable periodic solutions . inside the expanding and hence irregular sections , noise is exponentially amplified and creates orbits which appear chaotic .",
    "systems like eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) therefore have periodic orbits which are extremely sensitive to external noise , despite linear stability .",
    "the rather complex sequence of tangent bifurcations leading to the creation and destruction of the stable periodic orbits causes the orbits to depend sensitively on the system parameters , so that there is a complicated flipping from periodic to chaotic motion as a function of every single parameter as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : lyaps][fig : pf-8-y-100 ] . in the first one , we show the lyapunov exponent @xmath24 as a function of @xmath8 ( @xmath14 and @xmath38 fixed ) .",
    "the rapid change from chaotic to stable periodic solutions leads us to assume that both types of behaviors are supported by a dense set of parameters .",
    "the same follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : pf-9-y-100 ] where we show the lyapunov diagram where white ( black ) dots correspond to a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "there are clearly two regions where @xmath24 has a definite sign and an intermediate one where slight changes of @xmath8 or @xmath14 have a dramatic effect on the dynamics .",
    "we determined the fractal dimension of the boundary between stable and unstable solutions by finding the scaling of the number of @xmath0uncertain points as @xmath0 is varied  @xcite .",
    "a point @xmath50 is @xmath0uncertain if in a neighorhood of radius @xmath0 there exists at least one point where the lyapunov exponent has an opposite sign to the one evaluated at @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pf-8-y-100 ] we show those points of the previous figure that are @xmath0uncertain for @xmath51 . from the scaling of the number of uncertain points with @xmath0 we found the box counting dimension @xmath52 of the boundary between chaotic and stable solutions to be @xmath53 .",
    "this result gives a quantitative support to the idea that both stable and unstable orbits have a dense set of parameters .",
    "we also found that @xmath54 for @xmath55 and also for @xmath56 while it has a minumum value @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "as a first example that displays the behavior discussed previously we briefly present results of numerical experiments of an oscillatory flow in a duct filled with fluid .",
    "this flow can be generated by imposing oscillatory pressure or velocity fields at the ends of the duct with suitably defined phase lags .",
    "the stability of these flows can be described in terms of two nondimensional parameters , the oscillatory reynolds number @xmath59 and the stokes parameter @xmath24 .",
    "these are defined by @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a characteristic velocity , @xmath63 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath64 a characterisic distance of the duct and @xmath65 the stokes penetration depth .",
    "this last quantity is defined by @xmath66 with @xmath13 the frequency of the oscillation .",
    "it is a well established fact that zones of distinct dynamical qualitative behavior can be identified in the @xmath67,@xmath68 space .",
    "specifically , it has been experimentally observed that for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the flow is laminar , while for @xmath71 , the flow inside the duct is laminar for the phase intervals where the velocity is small while bursts with a frequency much larger than the forcing appear near the end of the acceleration phase  @xcite . as @xmath59 is increased , the phase interval where high frequency oscillations are present gets larger , but it never covers the cycle entirely .",
    "the origin of the high frequency oscillations is the generation of vortices due to the instability of the laminar flow .",
    "numerical results agree with the experiment  @xcite .    in particular , fig .",
    "[ juarez1500 ] shows the axial @xmath72 and transversal @xmath73 velocities in the middle of a duct . as can be observed , when the velocity is close to zero , the trace is smooth , indicating laminar flow",
    ", however , high frequency oscillations appear when the velocity reaches its maximum absolute value in each cycle .",
    "taking @xmath74 , as the lower limit of the characteristic frequency of the vortices , the ratio of the vortices frequency to the forcing frequency , @xmath75 is @xmath76 which for this example is 768 .",
    "this indicates that the changes in the driving force are slow compared with the internal vortex dynamics corresponding with the conditions discussed in the previous sections .",
    "our second example describes the dynamics of a dripping faucet with variable liquid supply .",
    "this problem , with constant liquid supply has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the time interval @xmath77 between successive drops shows a complicated bifurcation diagram as the water supply @xmath0 increases .",
    "there are two studies that are important in the context of the present analysis .",
    "the model presented by fuchikami _",
    "@xcite is relevant because it is built on sound physical phenomenology , but unfortunately is not simple and long time calculations involving many drops are extremely computing intensive . on the other hand , the model presented by coullet _",
    "@xcite which is based on the former , is useful since it is simple and can be used for exploring the long time behavior .",
    "both models can be adapted to analyze the system when the liquid supply varies as a harmonic function of time and they display a similar behavior with constant and variable liquid supply .",
    "the coullet model with constant liquid supply @xmath0 has a complicated bifurcation diagram and we choose a value @xmath78 in such a way that to its left there is are period one solutions , and to its right a densely chaotic region .",
    "we now consider a variable liquid supply that varies harmonically around a value near @xmath78 with a period which is approximately 1000 times larger than the characteristic period of the subsequent drop release with constant liquid supply and with an amplitude @xmath79 chosen in a way that the water supply does not extend outside the period four window .",
    "these conditions allow the system to visit alternatively a zone of irregular behavior and a zone of period four in the map of constant liquid supply .",
    "the result of the periodic variation of the water supply are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coullet2 ] .",
    "the continuous sinusoidal line represents the liquid supply and the dots the values of the time intervals between successive drops .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the system presents zones of stable and unsatble behavior as for the map of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logsyst ] ) .",
    "we discussed systems with periodic parameter fluctuations which are driven from regular to chaotic motion and back .",
    "although simple in its construction , this type of dynamics creates very complicated orbits with a complex dependence on control parameters . in computer simulations and in real experiments , it is impossible to distinguish the existence of stable complex periodic solutions and of chaotic solutions in the underlying model , since round - off errors and noise interact with the dynamics .",
    "we presented two numerical experiments that illustrate the change of behavior due to a periodic variation of a parameter with a time scale much larger than the natural time scale of the system where the discussion of the impossibility of distinguishing chaos from order is relevant .",
    "our detailed analysis was based on maps , but all features are found as well in systems with continuous time .",
    "it is also not relevant to assume sinusoidal variation of the parameter , so that we expect such a behavior to be rather widespread .",
