    "this account has several advantages , namely compared with the fokker - planck approach , which can not be applied to those cases where higher than second order cumulants of the noise are non - vanishing and also significant .",
    "this comprises poissonian  @xcite and other non - gaussian massive particles  @xcite as well as other cases where the interaction with a reservoir is described by a process with a non - zero singular part of the measure when a lvy - it ( li ) decomposition is applied  @xcite .    stemming from these facts",
    ", we perform a time averaging study of a small non - equilibrium system composed of two damped coupled oscillators at distinct temperatures and determine the explicit formula of the fourier s law for linear and non - linear cases . in spite of its simplicity ,",
    "the former has relevant traits : _",

    ". equations ( [ jtot])-([jsing ] ) pave the way to the following assertion ; _ when interacting particles are subject to white reservoirs and coupled in a linear form , the explicit thermal conductance is independent of the specific nature of the noise , namely the outcome of their lvy - it decomposition , whereas for non - linear coupling the nature of the measure of the noise ( its decomposition ) is pivotal_. in other words , the linear case is heedless of the measure of the reservoirs and it only takes into consideration their temperatures .",
    "hence , @xmath62 is exactly the same , either we have a wiener noise ( continuous measure ) , which is the standard noise in fundamental statistical mechanics studies @xcite , or a poisson noise ( paradigmatic case of singular measure ) . although the linear coupling result has only been explicitly proved for two particles , it is valid for general @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , _ for a linear chain , the local energy flow",
    "_ @xmath64 _ _  can be written as a function of the cumulants _",
    "_ @xmath65__and _ _ @xmath66 _ _ , wherein the dependence on the specific nature of the noise is eliminated , except for the respective temperatures__. on the other hand , if the nature of the noise affects the conductance of the simplest coupling element , the conductance for generic chains is also changed .",
    "this result is unexpected since contrarily to single particle linear cases , wherein the li nature is already relevant  @xcite , for coupled systems the li composition does solely become significant when the interaction between the elements of the system happens in a non - linear way . only in this case",
    "higher - order cumulants of the noise , which can be learnt as higher - order sources of energy , influence the result . for the same @xmath67 , in decreasing the singularity by soaring @xmath68 , the two thermal conductances",
    "tally .    to further illustrate these results",
    ", we have simulated cases of equally massive particles subject to wiener and poisson noises at different temperatures , @xmath69 . for the former",

    ", we depict linear coupling .",
    "it is visible that after a transient time , @xmath74 , the system reaches a stationary state and @xmath75 becomes equal to @xmath76 , whatever the reservoirs .",
    "in fact , even more complex models , such as linear chains of oscillators , verify the @xmath77 property . still , this is valid when each particle is perturbed by different types of noise , _",
    "e.g. _ , a brownian particle coupled with a poissonian particle .",

    "of a two massive particle system for different combinations of paradigmatic types of noise with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for poissonian particles .",
    "after the trasient , @xmath85 agrees with the theoretical value , @xmath86 , with the fitting curves lying within line thickness .",

    "to summarise , we have studied the thermal conduction in a paradigmatic mechanical system composed of two coupled damped harmonic oscillators subject to generic noises , which can be understood as a concise way to describe non - equilibrium problems . by averaging in the laplace space ,",
    "we have been able to determine the conductance of a linearly coupled system and approximate formulae for non - linearly coupled particles .",
    "we have shown the conductance of the former is independent of the nature of the ( white ) noise , namely its lvy - it decomposition structure .",
    "this result is unexpected since the measure of the thermal bath plays a major role for single particle properties .",
    "the dependence on the noise only emerges when there exists transfer of energy in a non - linear way and higher - order cumulants of the noise enter in the calculations . in the case of poisson noises , we show that the difference to brownian noises becomes negligeble when the ratio between the coupling constants and the rate of events is small .",
    "our calculations evidence the independence of the thermodynamical properties of the system from the nature of the reservoirs in linearly coupled systems . on the other hand , when the coupling is non - linear , the nature of the reservoirs affects the conductance , which represents a mixture between mechanic and thermodynamical properties of the system .",
    "our results have direct implication for the study of the thermal conductance of systems under the influence of noises other than wiener , for instance : _",
    "i ) _ solid state problems wherein shot ( singular measure ) noise is related to the quantisation of the charge  @xcite ; _ ii ) _ rlc circuits with injection of power at some rate resembling heat pumps  @xcite ; _ iii ) _ surface diffusion and low vibrational motion with adsorbates , _",
    "e.g. _ , na / cu(001 ) compounds  @xcite ; _ iv ) _ biological motors in which shot noise mimics the nonequilibrium stochastic hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate  @xcite and _ v ) _ molecular dynamics when the andersen thermostat is applied . actually , in molecular dynamics  @xcite , the langevin reservoir is just one in a large collection of baths represented by our definition of noise  ( [ noise ] ) . in these problems , for non - linearly coupled elements the experimentally measured energy flux will be greater than the energy flux given by langevin reservoirs at the same temperatures and equal if coupling is linear . at the theoretical level ,",
    "the method is worth being used to shed light on non - linear chains as well . within this context , the feasible approach is once again to consider a perturbative expansion of the non - linearities in the problem .",
    "we would like to thank the partial funding from faperj and cnpq ( w.a.m.m . ) and the european commission through the marie curie actions fp7-people-2009-ief ( contract nr 250589 ) ( s.m.d.q . ) .",
    "diogo o. soares - pinto is acknowledged for early discussions on this subject .",
    "as indicated in the main document the model consists of two masses connected by linear and non - linear springs so that,@xmath100    the flux of energy @xmath101 defines the thermal conductance . for this unidimensional mechanical system ,",
