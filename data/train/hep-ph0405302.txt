    "in the standard model , the production of a higgs boson in association with @xmath0 quarks is suppressed by the small size of the yukawa coupling , @xmath7 . however , in a supersymmetric theory with a large value of @xmath8 , the @xmath0-quark yukawa coupling can be strongly enhanced , and higgs production in association with @xmath0 quarks becomes the dominant production mechanism .    in a four - flavor - number scheme with no @xmath0 quarks in the initial state , the lowest order processes are the tree level contributions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : ggbbh_feyn ] .",
    "the inclusive cross section for @xmath9 develops potentially large logarithms proportional to @xmath11 which arise from the splitting of gluons into @xmath12 pairs .",
    "mass in the argument of the logarithm arises from collinear @xmath12 configurations , while the large scale @xmath13 stems from @xmath0 transverse momenta of this order , up to which factorization is valid .",
    "the scale @xmath13 is the end of the collinear region , which is expected to be of the order of @xmath14  @xcite . ] since @xmath15 , the splitting is intrinsically of @xmath16 , and because the logarithm is potentially large , the convergence of the perturbative expansion may be poor .",
    "the convergence can be improved by summing the collinear logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory through the use of @xmath0 quark parton distributions ( the five - flavor - number scheme )  @xcite at the factorization scale @xmath17 .",
    "this approach is based on the approximation that the outgoing @xmath0 quarks are at small transverse momentum .",
    "thus the incoming @xmath0 partons are given zero transverse momentum at leading order , and acquire transverse momentum at higher order .",
    "in the five - flavor - number scheme , the counting of perturbation theory involves both @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in this scheme ,",
    "the lowest order inclusive process is @xmath20 , see fig .",
    "[ fg : bbh_feyn ] .",
    "the first order corrections contain the @xmath21 corrections to @xmath22 and the tree level process @xmath23 , see fig .",

    "it is the latter process which imparts transverse momentum to the @xmath0 quarks .",
    "the relevant production mechanism depends on the final state being observed . for inclusive higgs production",
    "it is @xmath20 , while if one demands that at least one @xmath0 quark be observed at high-@xmath4 , the leading partonic process is @xmath26 .",
    "finally , if two high-@xmath4 @xmath0 quarks are required , the leading subprocess is @xmath27 .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) predictions for these processes have large uncertainties due to the strong dependence on the renormalization / factorization scales and also due to the scheme dependence of the @xmath0-quark mass in the higgs @xmath0-quark yukawa coupling .",
    "the scale and scheme dependences are significantly reduced when higher - order qcd corrections are included .",
    "section 2 describes the setup for our analysis , and in section 3 we compare the lo and nlo qcd results for the production of a higgs boson with two high-@xmath4 @xmath0 jets .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of the production of a higgs boson plus one high-@xmath4 @xmath0 jet at nlo , including a comparison of results within the four - flavor - number and the five - flavor - number schemes .",
    "we consider the corresponding inclusive higgs cross sections in section 5 .",
    "although motivated by the mssm and the possibility for enhanced @xmath0 quark higgs boson couplings , all results presented here are for the standard model . to a very good approximation the corresponding mssm results can be obtained by rescaling the bottom yukawa coupling  @xcite .",
    "all results are obtained using the cteq6l1 parton distribution functions ( pdfs )  @xcite for lowest order cross sections and cteq6 m pdfs for nlo results .",
    "the top quark is decoupled from the running of @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the nlo ( lo ) cross sections are evaluated using the @xmath30  ( @xmath31)-loop evolution of @xmath29 with @xmath32 .",
    "we use the @xmath33 running @xmath0 quark mass , @xmath28 , evaluated at @xmath30  ( @xmath31)-loop for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , with the @xmath0 pole mass taken as @xmath36  gev .",
    "the dependence of the rates on the renormalization ( @xmath37 ) and factorization @xmath38 scales is investigated  @xcite in order to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions for the inclusive higgs production channel and for the higgs plus @xmath39-jet channel .",

    "are combined into an effective @xmath0/@xmath42 quark momentum four - vector .",
    "all results presented in the four - flavor - number scheme have been obtained independently by two groups with good agreement  @xcite .",
    "requiring two high-@xmath4 bottom quarks in the final state reduces the signal cross section with respect to that of the zero and one @xmath0-tag cases , but it also greatly reduces the background .",
    "it also ensures that the detected higgs boson has been radiated off a @xmath0 or @xmath42 quark and the corresponding cross section is therefore unambiguously proportional to the square of the @xmath0-quark yukawa coupling at leading order , while at next - to - leading order this property is mildly violated by closed top - quark loops  @xcite .",
