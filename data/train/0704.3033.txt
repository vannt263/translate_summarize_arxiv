    "quite recently , iwai @xmath7 @xmath8 . have observed photoinduced melting of co in the @xmath0-rbzn salt and in @xmath9-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath10 ( called @xmath9-i@xmath10 for simplicity hereafter ) by femtosecond reflection spectroscopy.@xcite the @xmath0-rbzn and @xmath9-i@xmath10 salts show large and small molecular rearrangements , respectively , at the m - i transition .",

    ", we used the smaller system of the 12 sites hereafter and compared some results with those of the 16-site cluster .",
    "the conclusion is found to be unchanged and , in fact , understood from the perturbation theory from the strong - coupling limit , as discussed later .",
    "first , we see the effect of molecular rotations ( @xmath56 ) . the @xmath56-dependence of the modulations of transfer integrals and the hole densities is shown in fig .",
    "[ all](a ) with @xmath89 fixed . for small @xmath56 ,",
    "as all the phonons are undistorted and the hole densities are uniform ( @xmath90 ) , the ground state remains the coexistent state of the vertical - stripe co and the diagonal - stripe co. with increasing @xmath56 , the system discontinuously changes at a critical point @xmath91 , to the co state of broken symmetry .",
    "this co pattern is the hco-@xmath3 ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) , which agrees with the experimental findings.@xcite therefore , the coupling with molecular rotations ( @xmath56 ) plays an important role to realize this hco state .",
    "it is noted that @xmath52 increases almost linearly after the critical point where the hco-@xmath3 state is stable .",
    "this discontinuous change at the critical point would be caused by the finite - size effect : the undistorted state is stabilized by quantum tunneling between different co states , but its energy gain would vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , @xmath52 rises up linearly by infinitesimal @xmath56 in mean - field calculations,@xcite so we guess that the critical point approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "next , we consider the effect of translations in the @xmath21-direction ( @xmath54 ) . for large @xmath54 , they also stabilize the hco-@xmath3 state as shown in fig .",
    "[ all](b ) . in the case of @xmath54 , the charge disproportionation between the hole - rich sites (",
    "@xmath92 , @xmath93 ) and the hole - poor sites ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) is smaller than the case of @xmath56 , but the translations in the @xmath21-direction further stabilize the hco-@xmath3 .",
    "the situation regarding @xmath55 is quite different from the cases of @xmath56 and @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath55-dependence of the transfer modulations and the hole densities at four sites is shown in fig .",
    "[ all](c ) . in the presence of only @xmath51 , which represents translations in the @xmath34-direction ,",
    "the co pattern is still a horizontal - type but the holes are localized on the @xmath98 and @xmath99 bonds .",
    "thus , the experimental findings are not reproduced if only @xmath55 exists .    from figs .",
    "[ all](a)-[all](c ) , we conclude that the effects of molecular translations in the @xmath21-direction ( @xmath54 ) and molecular rotations ( @xmath56 ) are stronger than that of translations in the @xmath34-direction ( @xmath55 ) in this salt .",
    "we also come to the same conclusion in the other phases of fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] . in fig .",
    "[ variousv ] , we perform the same calculations ( except for the parameters shown ) as in fig .",
    "[ all](a ) for phases i@xmath80i and i@xmath80i@xmath80i .",
    "the @xmath56-induced hco-@xmath3 state is stable in both of phases i@xmath80i and i@xmath80i@xmath80i when @xmath56 is large enough .",
    "therefore , this characteristic phonon - induced feature is widely obtained on the @xmath44-@xmath59 plane , including @xmath100 ( irrespective of hole - hole correlations in the uniform ground state without electron - phonon couplings ) .",
    "finally , we simultaneously take the three kinds of displacements into account .",
    "considering a situation with thermal- or pressure - induced expansion or compression , we vary intersite coulomb interactions . in fig .",
    "[ strng - cplng ] , we show the modulations of transfer integrals and the hole densities as a function of nearest - neighbor coulomb interactions . for small @xmath101 , only @xmath51 is finite with @xmath50 and @xmath52 being zero .",
    "this situation is quite similar to fig .",
    "[ all](c ) , and hence the most stable state is the hco-@xmath98&@xmath99 .",
    "as @xmath101 approaches unity , which is a realistic value for @xmath0-rbzn , the experimentally observed hco-@xmath3 state becomes more stable than the hco-@xmath98&@xmath99 by gradually increasing @xmath50 and @xmath52 and rapidly decreasing @xmath51 . in the vicinity of @xmath102 for @xmath103 ,",
    "@xmath104 , and @xmath105 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 approximately correspond to the low - symmetry structure of @xmath0-rbzn at low temperature .    from the x - ray structure analysis,@xcite the molecular translations in the @xmath21- and @xmath34-directions are found to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and the corresponding distortions are @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "they give @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the present coupling strengths @xmath112 and @xmath113 lead to @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "a rough estimation of phonon frequencies by @xmath116 with @xmath117 being the reduced mass of two bedt - ttf molecules shows @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which are quite reasonable values.@xcite    as @xmath101 further increases beyond two , all modulations approach zero .",
    "in particular , @xmath51 decreases monotonically .",
    "we explain these behaviors with a perturbation theory from the strong - coupling limit in the following section .",

    "in this section , we consider why the hco-@xmath3 is the most stabilized by the electron - phonon couplings .",

    "[ modelf](b ) . in the ordinary perturbation theory ,",
    "the second- and third - order contributions to the energy per site read @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the @xmath126 spin operator at the @xmath14-th site on the @xmath3 bond . in the strong - coupling limit",

    "when @xmath128 becomes large , @xmath130 becomes small to reduce the energy loss . from the relations ( [ formation ] ) , @xmath131 becomes large and @xmath132 becomes small .",
    "equations ( [ 2nd - perturb ] ) and ( [ 3rd - perturb ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath133 where @xmath34 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) are independent of @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "note that we ignore @xmath139 in deriving the above equations , and the coefficients @xmath135 are positive under the condition @xmath140 .",
    "we can infer from eq .",
    "( [ apprx2 ] ) that @xmath52 increases linearly as a function of @xmath56 when the ground state is the hco-@xmath3 state .",

    ", we make a brief comment on the spinless fermion case.@xcite in the @xmath142 limit of the model([model ] ) , the hco state becomes unstable even if the modulations of the transfer integrals are introduced because the energy gain from spin fluctuations is absent .",
    "thus we demonstrate that cooperative effects of electron correlations and electron - phonon couplings are important in the @xmath0-rbzn salt .",
    "the stability of the hco state relative to the diagonal co state suggested in the spinless fermion case without electron - phonon couplings@xcite might be caused by the absence of phase factors , which are present if the @xmath142 limit is naively taken .",
    "we have investigated the cooperative effects of electron correlations and lattice distortions on the charge ordering in the @xmath0-rbzn salt . by means of the exact - diagonalization method for systems with up to 16 sites",
    ", we have calculated the hole - hole correlation functions , the hole densities and the modulations of transfer integrals to clarify the role of electron - phonon couplings in this salt .    in the absence of electron - phonon interactions ,",
    "there appear three uniform phases characterized by quantum tunneling between the vertical - stripe cos , that between the diagonal - stripe cos , and that between the vertical- and the diagonal - stripe cos .",
    "it is found that all of these phases are changed into the horizontal - stripe co by the introduction of electron - phonon couplings relevant to the @xmath0-rbzn salt .",
    "we can mostly reproduce the low - symmetry structure of @xmath0-rbzn at low temperature by using the model based on the high - symmetry structure at high temperature and by choosing the coupling strengths appropriately .",
    "we conclude that the structural deformation assists the horizontal - stripe co that is experimentally found.@xcite in particular , the effects of molecular translations in the @xmath21-direction and molecular rotations are found to be stronger than that of translations in the @xmath34-direction .",
    "thus , electron - phonon couplings are significant to stabilize the hco-@xmath3 and to realize the low - symmetry structure of @xmath0-rbzn .",
    "otherwise the long - range coulomb interactions favored a different co pattern . with the help of the perturbation theory from the strong - coupling limit",
