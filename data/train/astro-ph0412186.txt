    "the internal dynamical structure of galaxies retains evidence of their evolution .",
    "the internal dynamics , however , can only be interpreted through a combination of observational and theoretical efforts . from a theoretical point of view , one wants to know how the stars are distributed in space and what velocities they have . from the observational point of view , one wants to determine the intrinsic structure of the observed galaxies .",
    "the goals of both approaches are equivalent , and consist of the recovery of the phase - space density , or distribution function ( df ) of galaxies , which uniquely specifies their properties .",
    "an insight into the df is possible by the construction of dynamical models which are constrained by observations .",
    "there are several modelling methods established in the literature , of which schwarzschild s orbit - superposition method is perhaps the most elegant @xcite . in the past few years",
    "it has been applied successfully to a number of galaxies @xcite ; but recent observational advances in spectroscopy with integral - field units offer for the first time full two - dimensional constraints on these dynamical models ( @xcite ; copin , cretton & emsellem 2004 ) .",
    "this paper presents a case study of the early - type galaxy ngc  2974 .",
    "it is one of the few elliptical galaxies known to contain an extended disc of neutral hydrogen in regular rotation @xcite .",
    "it also hosts extended h@xmath0 emission , and belongs to the ` rapid rotators ' .",
    "the total absolute magnitude of @xmath1 puts ngc  2974 near the transition between giant ellipticals and the lower - luminosity objects which often show photometric and kinematic evidence for a significant disc component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter egf03 ) , combining wfpc2 imaging with tiger integral - field spectroscopy of the central few arcseconds , discovered a spiral structure in the h@xmath0 emission in the inner few arcseconds , and concluded that the galaxy contains a inner stellar bar .",
    "the general properties of ngc  2974 are listed in table  [ t : prop ] .",
    "the availability of both stellar and gaseous kinematics makes ngc  2974 a very interesting case for detailed dynamical modelling .",
    "@xcite made dynamical jeans models of the gaseous and stellar components additionally introducing a stellar disc in order to fit their long - slit data along three position angles .",
    "they found that the stellar and gaseous discs were kinematically aligned and the inclination of both discs was consistent with 60 .",
    "this prompted them to suggest a common evolution , where the gas could be ionised by the stars in the stellar disc . using more sophisticated two - integral axisymmetric models , which assume the df depends only on the two classical integrals of motion , the energy @xmath2 and the angular momentum with respect to the symmetry axis @xmath3",
    ", egf03 were able to reproduce all features of @xcite data as well as their integral - field tiger data ( covering the inner 4 ) .",
    "the models of egf03 did not require a thin stellar disc to fit the data .",
    "in this study we construct axisymmetric models for ngc  2974 based on schwarzschild s orbit superposition method .",
    "this method allows the df to depend on all three isolating integrals of motion .",
    "all previous studies with three - integral models concentrated on the determination of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath4 , and mass of the central black hole , @xmath5 . based on the observed stellar velocity dispersion , the @xmath6 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicts a central black hole mass of @xmath7 , which at the distance of ngc  2974 ( 21.48 mpc , @xcite ) has a radius of influence of @xmath8 .",
    "our observations of ngc  2974 , with the integral - field spectrograph sauron @xcite , do not have the necessary resolution to probe the sphere of influence of the central black hole .",
    "the dynamical models presented here are therefore aimed at determination of the @xmath4 , the inclination , @xmath9 , and the internal orbital structure .",
    "the stellar and gaseous kinematics also provide independent estimates of @xmath4 and @xmath9 , which can be used to cross - validate the results from the two approaches .",
    "the results of the dynamical modelling are influenced by the assumptions of the models , but also by the specifics of the observations .",
    "the spatial coverage of the kinematics is one example .",
    "the two - dimensional coverage is an improvement over a few slits often used in other studies .",
    "similarly , increasing the radial extent of the data could change the results .",
    "another issue , associated with the modelling techniques , is the ability of the three - integral models to recover the true distribution function of the galaxy .",
    "this is very important for the investigation of the internal dynamics , since the recovered orbital distribution must represent the observed galaxy if we want to learn about the galaxy s evolutionary history . in this paper",
    "we present tests designed to probe these issues and , in general , to determine the robustness of our three - integral method .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ s : obs ] summarises the sauron spectroscopy and the photometric ground- and space - based data .",
    "the analysis of the velocity maps , used to quantify the presence and influence of possible non - axisymmetric motions as well as a brief discussion on bars in ngc  2974 , is presented in section  [ s : kin ] .",
    "the three - integral dynamical models for the stellar motions are discussed in section  [ s : dyno ] .",
    "section  [ s : tests ] is devoted to tests of the three - integral method involving the determination of the model parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath9 ) , influence of the radial extent of the data and the recovery of the df .",

    "the imaging data were presented in egf03 and the absorption - line kinematics of the sauron observations in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter e04 ) as part of the sauron survey @xcite . in this study",
    "we also use the sauron emission - line kinematics of ngc  2974 .",
    "ngc  2974 was observed with the integral - field spectrograph sauron mounted on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) in march 2001 .",
    "the observations consisted of eight exposures divided equally between two pointings , each covering the centre and one side of the galaxy .",
    "the individual exposures of both pointings were dithered to obtain a better estimate of detector sensitivity variations and avoid systematic errors .",
    "the instrumental characteristics of sauron and a summary of the observations are presented in table  [ t : sau_ins ] .",
    "the sauron  data were reduced following the steps described in @xcite using the dedicated software xsauron developed at cral - observatoire . the performed reduction steps included bias and dark subtraction , extraction of the spectra using a fitted mask model , wavelength calibration , low frequency flat - fielding , cosmic - ray removal , homogenisation of the spectral resolution over the field , sky subtraction and flux calibration .",
    "all eight exposures were merged into one data cube with a common wavelength range by combining the science and noise spectra using optimal weights and ( re)normalisation . in this process",

    "two - dimensional kinematic maps offer a large amount of information and are often superior to a few long - slit velocity profiles . the two - dimensional nature of these data motivates us to quantify the topology and structure of these kinematic maps , just as is commonly done for simple imaging .",
    "we have developed a new technique to deal with kinematic maps based on the fourier expansion , and , due to its similarity to the photometry , we named it kinemetry @xcite .",

    "the aim of the method is to extract general properties from the kinematic maps of spheroidal systems ( early - type galaxies ) without assuming a specific intrinsic geometry ( e.g. thin disc ) for the distribution of stars .",
    "this changes the interpretation and the approach to the terms of the harmonic expansion from the case of cold neutral hydrogen or co discussed in the above - mentioned papers . in this section",
    "we briefly present the method and apply it to the stellar and gaseous velocity maps ( krajnovi et al .",

    "the expansion is possible for all moments of the losvd , but in this paper we restrict ourselves to the mean velocity maps .",
    "the kinematic moments ( moments of losvd ) of triaxial galaxies in a stationary configuration have different parity , e.g. , mean velocity is odd , while the second moment @xmath70 , is even .",
    "the parity of a moment generates certain symmetries of the kinematics maps .",
    "more generally , the maps of odd moments are @xmath71 , or : @xmath72 if axisymmetry is assumed , in addition to the previous relation , maps are @xmath73 , or : @xmath74 these symmetry conditions translate into the requirement on the harmonic expansion ( eq .  [ eq : kinemetry ] ) that for point - anti - symmetric maps the even coefficients in the expansion are equal to zero , while in the case of mirror - anti - symmetry , additionally , the odd phase angles have a constant value , equal to the photometric position angle ( pa ) of the galaxy in the case of a true axisymmetric galaxy .",
    "this means that to reconstruct the mean velocity map of a stationary triaxial galaxy , it is sufficient to use only odd terms in the expansion .",

    "<S> we find that the models can accurately recover the input mass - to - light ratio , but we confirm that even with perfect input kinematics the inclination is only marginally constrained . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a possible degeneracy in the determination of the inclination , but further investigations are needed to clarify this issue . for a given potential , we find that the analytic distribution function of our test model is well recovered by the three - integral model within the spatial region constrained by integral - field kinematics .    </S>",
