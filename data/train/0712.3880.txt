    "quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) metals are interesting materials because of their tendency to undergo a phase - transition inevitably due to the inherent instability called the peierls instability @xcite .",
    "this instability , originating from the electron - phonon interaction leads to a metal - insulator transition at reduced temperature , where the insulating state may be characterized by a lattice deformation in conjunction with a charge modulation and the opening of a single particle excitation gap in the electronic spectrum.@xcite one of the striking features of these materials are their unusual non - linear electrical conduction properties @xcite , which arises due to the collective motion of the charge - density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "along with the conventional single particle excitations , these materials also have collective excitations , _ viz . _ ,",
    "amplitudons and phasons , which dominate the low energy physical properties @xcite .",
    "the raman active collective amplitudon mode , _",
    "i.e. _ the transverse oscillation of the amplitude of the coupled charge - lattice wave , has been observed by various researchers @xcite .",
    "blue bronze , a@xmath0moo@xmath1  ( a = alkali metal ) is one of the best known quasi-1d materials which undergoes a cdw transition@xcite via the peierls channel .",
    "the first evidence of the cdw transition in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  by raman measurements came from the experiments by travaglini and wachter@xcite . in this paper a mode around 50 @xmath2  was observed at temperatures below t@xmath3  @xmath4  k that showed a strong temperature dependence of , in particular , its frequency when the temperature approached tcdw from below . as it was also found that this is a fully symmetric ( @xmath5-mode ) breathing mode it was assigned to the amplitude oscillation of the charge density wave .",
    "further evidence came from the observation that the line width tends to diverge as the @xmath6 was approached from below .",
    "this anomalous behaviour of the line width could be due to the fluctuation effects that become pronounced in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "mean - field theory of a generalized second - order phase transition predicts that , due to a temperature dependent order parameter , the frequency ( and the amplitude ) of the soft mode tends to zero as the temperature is approaches t@xmath3.@xcite however , in the the study by travaglini _",
    "et al_. @xcite the softening of the amplitudon mode with increasing temperature was found to be incomplete .",
    "the observed softening of only @xmath713  % was ascribed to 3d - correlations .",
    "the 3d - correlations are nothing but the long range coulomb interaction between density - modulated electrons , which might effectively screen the electron - phonon interaction @xcite , thereby reducing the expected complete mode - softening .",
    "the effects of strong local electron - electron interaction leads to both dynamical and static screening processes dressing the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "these screening effects are thought to be a generic feature of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "recently a raman study of the anomalous profile of the amplitudon mode in k@xmath0moo@xmath1   was reported @xcite in which for temperatures below 100 k the amplitudon mode showed an anomalous `` fin''-like profile toward the stoke s side of it s central frequency .",
    "this was interpreted as splitting of the amplitudon mode into two or more closely spaced harmonic oscillator type modes .",
    "the splitting was claimed to be due to a strong perturbation of the charge density wave by impurity potentials . at very low temperatures where there are practically no thermally excited electrons the impurity potentials remain unscreened , leading to a spatial variation of the cdw amplitude and a splitting of the amplitudon mode .",
    "the present paper revisits the vibrational and electronic excitations in the blue bronzes through a comparative study of rb@xmath0moo@xmath1   and k@xmath0moo@xmath1  in order to examine the behaviour of the amplitudon mode in both the compounds together with a detailed temperature and polarization dependent study of the low energy phonons .",
    "at room temperature the k@xmath0moo@xmath1  and rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  bronzes crystallize in the monoclinic c__2/m _ _ space group @xcite with lattice constants _ _ a__=16.23  , _ _",

    "there are 20 formula units per unit cell .",
    "the structure is build up by edge and corner sharing clusters of ten strongly distorted moo@xmath10 octahedra stacked along the [ 010 ] direction .",
    "these clusters form layers in the ( 102 ) planes , which are separated by the alkali ions .    at the charge density wave transition temperature",
    "the structure transforms in an incommensurately modulated structure with a temperature dependent incommensurate wave vector @xmath11 close to ( but not equal to ) @xmath12.@xcite at low temperature ( @xmath13  k ) the incommensurate wave vector becomes temperature independent , even though this does not seem to correspond to a lock in transition , _",
    "i.e. _ the modulation remains incommensurate.@xcite    k@xmath0moo@xmath1  and rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  single crystals with typical size @xmath14  mm@xmath15 were prepared by the temperature gradient flux method@xcite . after polishing ,",
    "samples were mounted in an optical flow cryostat ( temperature stabilization better than 0.1 k ) and backscattering raman spectra were recorded ( frequency resolution @xmath72  @xmath2 ) using a triple grating monochromator in subtractive mode equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled ccd detector . a solid - state diode - pumped , frequency - doubled @xmath16  laser system is used as excitation source ( wavelength 532  nm , spot size 10  @xmath17 m ) .",
    "the power density was kept below 100  w/@xmath18  in order to minimize heating effects .",
    "the polarization was controlled on both the incoming and outgoing beam , giving access to all the polarizations allowed for by the back - scattering configuration .",
    "in general both parallel ( ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 is in the [ 20 - 1 ] direction , and ( @xmath21 ) in porto notation ) and perpendicular polarizations have been measured .",

    "only a few modes are observed in the ( @xmath21 ) spectra ( fig .  [ ram1 ] , left panel ) since here the polarizations are along the metallic direction .",
    "there is a strong mode near 475  @xmath2 , a triplet with frequencies near 320 , 365 , and 400  @xmath2 , and some weaker modes below 200  @xmath2 .",
    "the symmetric ( @xmath22 ) modes above 300  @xmath2  originate from bending vibrations of the moo@xmath23 units , as has already been noted in previous studies on blue bronzes@xcite , and is consistent with the interpretation of the raman spectra of pure @xmath24@xcite .",
    "there are quite a few different modes originating from the moo@xmath23 units , due to the large distortion of the moo@xmath23 `` octahedra '' ; the metal - oxygen distances in blue bronzes typically range from 1.7 to 2.3  @xcite .",

    "et al . , _ @xcite and massa @xcite . in general , the frequencies for the modes observed in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  are somewhat lower than the corresponding modes in k@xmath0moo@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  has slightly larger lattice constants in the @xmath25  and @xmath26   directions@xcite resulting from the larger ionic radius of the rubidium ion .",

    "i.e. _ perpendicular to metallic direction .",
    "as expected , the scattering efficiency in this direction is substantially higher than in the metallic direction , and quite a few more modes are observed . in both rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  and",
    "k@xmath0moo@xmath1  there are about 20 modes that are resolved in the present experiment .",
    "again , the overall spectra are qualitatively very similar and many of the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1   vibrational modes are shifted toward slightly lower frequency in comparison to the k@xmath0moo@xmath1  modes .",
    "for instance the triplet near 150  @xmath2   in the k@xmath0moo@xmath1  bronze are found some 10 - 15  @xmath2  lower in energy in the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  spectra , and the 480  @xmath2  k@xmath0moo@xmath1  mode is observed at 473  @xmath2  in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  .    finally , note that group theory predicts 71 a@xmath30 modes for the high temperature phase of the bronzes .",
    "the experimental spectra , however , reveal only 35 modes .",
    "the `` missing '' modes most likely result from accidental degeneracies and from weak intensity and/or screening , in particular in the metallic direction .",

    "the low temperature phase shows a much richer spectrum than the high temperature one ( see figs .",
    "[ ram4 ] and [ ram3 ] ) , showing many quite narrow raman modes .",
    "the ( @xmath21 ) polarized low temperature spectra ( fig .",
    "[ ram4 ] ) exhibit 32 distinct modes for the k@xmath0moo@xmath1   compound , and 42 in the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  compound .",
    "for the ( @xmath19 ) polarization ( fig .",
    "[ ram3 ] ) the number of observed modes is 38 and 44 for k@xmath0moo@xmath1   and rb@xmath0moo@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "again , the spectra for the two compounds are quite similar .",
    "the main difference is the number of observed modes which seems to originate from an additional splitting of modes in the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  case .",
    "for instance the doublet observed near 75  @xmath2  in k@xmath0moo@xmath1   is seen as a triplet ( see also left inset fig.[ram3 ] ) .",
    "we note that , in a previous raman study @xcite a band near 80 @xmath2  was observed in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  which was ascribed to a zone - folded mode arising from the folding of the original brillouin - zone due to cdw transition .",
    "the picture of zone - folding - active phonons is corroborated by previous neutron scattering studies by pouget _",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite in which a flat dispersion - less phonon branch was observed . in the present study",
    "three modes are observed in the k@xmath0moo@xmath1  compound in the 40 - 100  @xmath2  region , and five in the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  compound .",
    "as is discussed in section [ tdep ] , the lowest modes at 56  @xmath2  ( k@xmath0moo@xmath1 ) and 53  @xmath2  ( rb@xmath0moo@xmath1 ) are the amplitudon mode of the cdw .",
    "note that only a single mode is observed here , and no evidence is found for the `` fin '' like structure as discussed by shigeru _",
    "also the mo - o bending modes show an additional splitting in the the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  compound , which is exemplified by the right inset of fig .",
    "[ ram3 ] for the 480  @xmath2mode . as a general rule ,",
    "splitting of raman modes occurs mainly due to two mechanisms .",
    "the first one occurs when a static distortion transforms equivalent atomic positions to inequivalent ones @xcite .",
    "a second mechanism is the correlation field or davydov@xcite splitting that occurs due to coupling of vibrations of molecular units at different equivalent sites in the unit cell , and is sensitive to transitions involving multiplication of the unit cell size ( like for instance the peierls distortion ) .",
    "the incommensurate nature of the blue bronzes may also activate vibrational modes in raman spectra@xcite .",
    "modes with wave vector * k*@xmath33*q * become active in the incommensurate phase , where * q * is the incommensurate modulation vector , and their scattering strength depends strongly on the modulation amplitude .",
    "the temperature dependence of the low frequency modes of both compounds is depicted in fig .",
    "[ ram45 ] for a few selected temperatures .",
    "as mentioned before , in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  there are only two clear phonons observed in this region at 74  @xmath2 , and 85  @xmath2 , whereas the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  compound shows four phonon modes in this region centred at 64 , 75 , 83 , and 90  @xmath2 .",
    "this , as well as the previously noted additional splitting in some of the high frequency modes in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1 , strongly indicates that the low temperature structures of the two compounds are not completely identical . in general",
    "it is thought that the crystal structures of rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  and k@xmath0moo@xmath1  are , apart from the unit cell dimensions , the same@xcite .",
    "the only relevant small difference lies in the incommensurate modulation .",
    "both structures have their incommensurate modulation along the * b@xmath34 * direction .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation , however , is found to be substantially larger for the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  compound@xcite .",
    "therefore , we tentatively conclude that the observation of a larger number of modes in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1 , as compared to k@xmath0moo@xmath1 , is due to the larger displacement amplitude of the incommensurate modulation in the low temperature phase .",

    "the spectra have been given an offset for clarity . ]    upon decreasing temperature the modes in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  show a continuous behaviour , and no further indications for a possible additional phase transition are found .",
    "this in contrast to the situation in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  . upon lowering the temperature ,",
    "some of the modes show an abrupt change in their energy in the between 80  k and 100  k. this is exemplified in fig .",
    "clearly some of the modes show a discontinuous shift to higher energy of a few wave numbers indicating a phase transition .",
    "it should be noted that not all modes exhibit the frequency-kink , as can for instance be seen for the 75  @xmath2  mode in fig.[ram7 ] . in general , a temperature - dependent frequency - jump is a signature of a first - order transition . in the present case",
    ", it could be due to a lock - in transition to a commensurate state .",
    "however , the low temperature phase of k@xmath0moo@xmath1   has been studied in quite some detail and temperature dependent neutron scattering experiments@xcite failed to show a lock - in transition in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  .",
    "it was found that the incommensurate wave vector is strongly temperature dependent down to @xmath35  k. below this temperature the wave vector becomes temperature independent , but remains incommensurate .",
    "still , the present study strongly indicates that there is indeed a first order phase transition in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  below 100  k.     details of the ( @xmath19 ) polarized raman spectra of k@xmath0moo@xmath1  showing a discontinuous energy shift between 80k and 100k for some of the modes .",
    "the spectra have been given an offset for clarity . ]",
    "the most salient feature in the low frequency spectra is the appearance of the amplitudon in both compounds which shows a softening and broadening upon approaching the phase transition ( see fig.[ram45 ] ) .",
    "the low temperature frequencies of these modes are 56  @xmath2  in the k@xmath0moo@xmath1   compound , and 53  @xmath2  in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  .",
    "the interpretation of these modes as amplitudon modes is consistent with the previous neutron study by pouget _",
    "et al . , _ @xcite , and raman scattering studies by travaglini _",
    "et al . , _ @xcite and massa @xcite .",
    "recently this mode has also been observed in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  as coherent excitations in pump - probe transient reflectivity experiments @xcite , in addition to coherent phonon excitations@xcite at 74  @xmath2 , and 85  @xmath2  also observed in the present data .",
    "temperature dependent energy ( left panel ) and line width ( right panel ) of the amplitudon mode in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  and rb@xmath0moo@xmath1 . ]",
    "the amplitudon modes disappear from the spectra already around 150  k. this is due to the strongly over damped nature of the amplitudon in the vicinity of the phase transition to the metallic state originating from strong fluctuations of the charge density wave .",
    "these fluctuations lead to a diverging line width ( see fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] , right panel ) , which in turn makes it impossible to observe complete amplitude softening .",
    "the observable amplitudon softening upon approaching the phase transition amounts only about 10 % , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ linewidth ] ( left panel ) .",
    "line width of the phonon modes in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  as a function of their energy for @xmath36  k , 100  k , and 170  k. ]    finally , turn back to the phonon modes observed in the cdw phase .",
    "the phonon modes observed at low temperatures are rather narrow , and often resolution limited .",
    "this is in particular true for the phonons below 400  @xmath2 .",
    "fig.[ram11 ] displays the measured line width of the phonons as a function of their frequencies in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  for various temperatures .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , at 6  k the line width of the modes are very narrow up to @xmath7350  @xmath2 . in contrast , the modes above 350  @xmath2  show a progressive increase in their line width . in other words , there is a sharp onset near 350  @xmath2 in the behaviour of the line widths . as temperature",
    "is increased this onset shifts to lower frequencies .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  .    the observed anomalous line broadening hints to a coupling of the phonons to electronic excitations with an energy above @xmath7350  @xmath2 , which , given the temperature dependence , scale with the cdw gap .",
    "since the cdw energy gap in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  is about 900  @xmath2  it can not be a coupling to the usual quasi - particle excitations .",
    "it has been argued in the literature that a common feature of incommensurate cdw materials is the presence of so called midgap states@xcite .",
    "therefore the anomalous broadening of the phonons above @xmath7350  @xmath2  is tentatively assigned to a coupling of the phonons to midgap state excitations .",
    "in summary , we have studied two representatives of the prototypical quasi - one - dimensional charge density wave system , blue bronze , using temperature and polarization dependent raman scattering experiments .",
    "the cdw transition lead to the activation of a large number of modes in the low temperature phase of both the bronzes .",
    "the amplitudon mode , found at nearly equal energy in rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  and k@xmath0moo@xmath1  ( there is a 2  @xmath2  difference between them ) , shows a rapid exponential broadening upon approaching the phase transition from below making it impossible to observe a full softening of this mode .",
    "the observation of a number of additional modes in the rb@xmath0moo@xmath1  compound is assigned to the stronger incommensurate modulation in this compound .",
    "this conclusion is , however , based on the limited amount of low temperature structural studies , and it would be interesting to perform additional studies to confirm the present interpretation .",
    "this also holds for the observed changes in the k@xmath0moo@xmath1  spectra between 80 and 100  k , which indicate a first order phase transition .",
    "this is in line with the recently discussion of the maximum in the threshold field for cdw conduction which was interpreted as due to a incommensurate - commensurate phase transition ( lock - in transition).@xcite this transition is not related to the recently reported observation of a glass transition in k@xmath0moo@xmath1  by staresinic _",
    "et al._@xcite at @xmath37  k , for which no further evidence was found in the present study .",
    "finally , evidence is found for a coupling of the high frequency phonons to mid - gap excitations .",
