    "<S> we have identified a class of zero - dimensional classical and quantum heisenberg spin systems exhibiting anomalous behavior in an external magnetic field @xmath0 similar to that found for the geometrically frustrated kagom lattice of classical spins . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations for the isotropic heisenberg model show the emergence of a pronounced minimum in the differential susceptibility @xmath1 at @xmath2 as the temperature @xmath3 is raised from @xmath4  k for structures based on corner - sharing triangles , specifically the octahedron , cuboctahedron , and icosidodecahedron . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide the first experimental evidence for this behavior @xmath1 : it is exhibited by the giant keplerate magnetic molecule \\{@xmath5 }  ( @xmath6 ions with spin @xmath7 on the 30 vertices of an icosidodecahedron ) . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum in @xmath1 is due to the fact that for low temperatures when @xmath8 there exist two competing families of spin configurations of which one behaves magnetically `` stiff '' leading to a reduction of the differential susceptibility .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetism of frustrated one- , two- , and three - dimensional lattice spin systems is a fascinating subject due to the richness of phenomena that are observed @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report that one effect of geometrical frustration , which so far has been reported @xcite only for the theoretical model of classical spins on a kagom lattice , already appears for a class of _ zero - dimensional _ </S>",
    "<S> materials , namely certain magnetic molecules hosting highly symmetric arrays of classical or quantum spins . </S>",
    "<S> these molecular units @xcite contain a set of paramagnetic ions whose mutual interactions are described by isotropic heisenberg exchange and where the _ inter_molecular magnetic interactions ( dipole - dipole for the most part ) are negligible as compared to _ intra_molecular heisenberg exchange . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic molecules as zero - dimensional spin systems provide a new avenue for detailed exploration of the basic issues of geometric frustration . </S>",
    "<S> they are particularly appealing since they offer the prospect of being modeled unencumbered by some of the complications of bulk magnetic materials .    </S>",
    "<S> we here report experimental and theoretical results for the occurrence of a striking anomaly in the differential susceptibility @xmath1 versus magnetic field @xmath0 that is exhibited by the giant keplerate magnetic molecule \\{@xmath5 }  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this molecule features 30 @xmath6 ions on the vertices of an icosidodecahedron that interact via nearest - neighbor ( nn ) isotropic antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange ( @xmath9  k ) . due to their near - perfect @xmath10-symmetric coordination environment , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 ions represent ideal @xmath7 spin centers with virually no single - ion anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we also present theoretical results for the classical and quantum heisenberg model showing that the same anomaly in @xmath1 occurs for a class of geometrically frustrated zero - dimensional systems , where spins mounted on the vertices of a triangle , octahedron , cuboctahedron , or an icosidodecahedron interact via nn isotropic af exchange . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature @xmath3 is raised from 0 k a deep narrow minimum in @xmath1 emerges in the vicinity of one - third the saturation field @xmath11 , which upon increasing @xmath3 extends over a larger field interval and its sharp features progressively deteriorate . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this phenomenon to a common topological property of these polytopes , namely that each is assembled from corner - sharing triangles . in the classical case </S>",
    "<S> the drop in @xmath1 can be understood as a result of the interplay of two effects : in the immediate vicinity of @xmath2 a family of `` up - up - down '' ( _ uud _ ) spin configurations are energetically competitive with the continuous family of spin configurations of lowest energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the _ uud _ spin configurations are magnetically `` stiff '' , i.e. @xmath12 for low temperatures , and thus reduce the susceptibility of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> we write the af heisenberg hamiltonian as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a positive energy , the spin operators @xmath15 are in units of @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the external field , @xmath18 is the spectroscopic splitting factor , @xmath19 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath20 directs that the sum is over distinct nearest - neighbor pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the classical counterpart of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) is obtained by replacing each spin operator @xmath15 by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a c - number unit vector @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one very attractive feature of the polytopes under consideration is that their exact classical ground state energy is known @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath23 it is given by @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is called the classical heisenberg exchange constant , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the number of corner - sharing triangles ( @xmath29 for the octahedron , cuboctahedron , and icosidodecahedron , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> a plot of this quantity versus @xmath30 is shown in fig .  [ energy ] ( solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state magnetic moment and differential susceptibilty are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath33 each spin system is decomposable into 3 sublattices of @xmath34 spins each ; all spins of a given sublattice are mutually parallel ; the sublattices are characterized by three coplanar unit vectors with angular spacings of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of the system is linear in @xmath0 until @xmath11 and constant ( fully saturated configuration ) for larger fields . </S>",
    "<S> the linear rise with @xmath0 can be pictured in terms of the folding of an `` umbrella '' @xcite defined by the three sublattice unit vectors as they close towards the field vector @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ energy ] are the energy curves for three other specific configurations of interest . these are configurations where the three ( unit ) spin vectors associated with each triangle are constrained to be collinear and the resultant vector is either parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations are labeled as _ uuu _ ( up - up - up ) , _ uud _ , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ddu_. for each of these collinear configurations the magnetic moment of the polytope is independent of @xmath0 and thus @xmath1 vanishes and one can describe these configurations as being magnetically `` stiff '' . </S>",
    "<S> the fully saturated _ uuu _ </S>",
    "<S> configuration is of minimal energy for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ uud _ </S>",
    "<S> configuration is of special interest since its energy coincides with the minimal energy of the spin system for @xmath37 and exceeds the minimal energy for any other choice of field . for @xmath38  k and for </S>",
    "<S> any choice of @xmath0 other than @xmath11 the _ uud _ configuration will not play a role . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath39  k and for @xmath0 in the vicinity of @xmath2 a significant contribution to the partition function will arise from the set of configurations derived by infinitesimal modifications of the _ uud _ configuration . </S>",
    "<S> these slightly modified _ uud _ </S>",
    "<S> configurations lead to a reduction of the differential susceptibility of the system because of their magnetic stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> our qualitative considerations for @xmath39  k are confirmed by the results of our classical monte carlo simulations for the three polytopes as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ all_dmdh ] . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fe30_theory ] displays the results for a classical model of \\{@xmath5 } , namely 30 classical spins on the vertices of an icosidodecahedron , as substitutes for quantum spins with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath3 is increased from @xmath4 k a sharp narrow drop emerges that is situated at @xmath2 ( vertical dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath3 continues to increase the drop extends over a larger interval and its sharp features progressively wash away . </S>",
    "<S> one also observes a temperature dependence of the field associated with the minimum in @xmath1 , i.e. , it decreases with increasing @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of these theoretical results to real magnetic materials is demonstrated by our experimental data for the differential susceptibilty of the giant keplerate magnetic molecule \\{@xmath5}. the magnetization was measured at @xmath40  k in pulsed magnetic fields up to 23 tesla ( sweep rate 15000 tesla / s ) at the okayama high magnetic field laboratory by using a standard inductive method . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was immersed in liquid @xmath41he to maintain good contact with the thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results for @xmath1 ( in arbitrary units ) are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fe30_exp ] and the drop at about @xmath2 is clearly evident .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the data resembles the simulational curve for @xmath42  k ( see inset fig .  [ fe30_exp ] ) , not @xmath40  k , perhaps suggesting an elevated effective spin temperature due to the high sweep rate . to clarify this point we also measured the magnetization in steady fields by a capacitance method in the range up to @xmath43 tesla for @xmath44  mk and @xmath45  k and obtained close agreement with the pulsed - field data </S>",
    "<S> the considerable broadening of the drop in @xmath1 may point to the occurence of a staggered field @xcite , since the principal axes of the fe ions are not strictly equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> a specific suggestion @xcite is that the broadening is due to dzyaloshinskii - moriya terms supplementing the isotropic heisenberg model , originating from possible low symmetry of the nearest - neighbor fe - fe bond . </S>",
    "<S> further study of this issue is warranted .    to explore the role of quantum effects we have calculated @xmath1 for the triangle and the octahedron of spins with arbitrary @xmath46 as well as for a cuboctahedron ( @xmath47 ) with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter system this involves numerical diagonalization of matrices defined on a hilbert space of dimension @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . even by fully exploiting the symmetries of the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> this is at the limit of present day computing capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the cuboctahedron with @xmath49 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cubo_q ] for different temperatures . as in the previous figures </S>",
    "<S> one again encounters a strong reduction of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum is located exactly at @xmath52 , but since @xmath0 and @xmath53 are not strictly proportional for a quantum system the drop occurs for fields slightly larger than @xmath2 . for @xmath38  </S>",
    "<S> k @xmath53 vs. @xmath0 can be described as a `` staircase '' of 12 steps originating from ground state zeeman level crossings and @xmath1 consists of a set of dirac delta functions at the crossing fields . for @xmath39  </S>",
    "<S> k the abrupt magnetization steps are smoothed out and @xmath1 exhibits finite peaks . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the triangle and the octahedron for general spins @xmath46 exhibit the same overall behavior seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cubo_q ] .    </S>",
    "<S> one can understand that the pronounced minimum in the susceptibility occurs for classical as well quantum spins by examining the partition function for the particularly simple example of the triangle where the results can be obtained by exact analytical methods . </S>",
    "<S> for integer spins @xmath46 the quantum partition function may be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the multiplicity factor , namely the number of distinct ways of achieving total spin @xmath60 upon adding three distinct ( integer ) quantum spins @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the analogous formulas are easily derived for half - integer spins @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> formula ( [ z.quantum ] ) for @xmath65 is very similar to that for the classical heisenberg triangle which may be written as @xcite @xmath66 here @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 , arising from considering the geometrical volume available to three unit vectors such that the magnitude of their vector sum lies within a shell of radius s and unit thickness . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it is straightforward to verify that in the limit @xmath71 the quantum result ( eq .  ( [ z.quantum ] ) ) agrees with the classical formula ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z.classical ] ) ) . in the quantum formula </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity factor corresponds to the classical geometrical function @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> each of these quantities has two distinct branches , depending on whether @xmath60 is in the interval @xmath73 $ ] or @xmath74 $ ] or whether @xmath75 is in the interval @xmath76 $ ] or @xmath77 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the existence of two distinct branches becomes manifest in various higher derivatives of @xmath78 at nonzero temperatures for fields in the vicinity of @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath79 there exists a narrow field range at about @xmath2 such that each of the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 has a very narrow maximum for @xmath82 and @xmath83 but nevertheless samples the two branches . </S>",
    "<S> this is the mathematical orgin of the pronounced minimum in @xmath1 at @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> plateau like structures in the magnetization versus b in various two- and three - dimensional lattices built of corner - sharing triangles lattices at one - third of the saturated moment have been under investigation for the past two decades as an expression of geometric frustration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , theoretical studies of the classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice show that @xmath1 has a pronounced minimum at one - third of @xmath11 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , the study of selective magnetic molecules such as \\{@xmath5}can give new insights for this subject since such molecules are much better accessible both experimentally and theoretically .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that for a class of geometrically frustrated magnetic polytopes , namely the octahedron , the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecahedron , field - induced competitive spin configurations exist which manifest themselves in an pronounced minimum in the differential susceptibility @xmath1 in the vicinity of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also reported the first experimental observation of this effect . </S>",
    "<S> our data for the giant keplerate magnetic molecule \\{@xmath5 }  are consistent with our classical monte carlo results for the icosidodecahedron . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that this feature reflects a general intrinsic property of the very building block of these specific polytopes , namely the simple af equilateral heisenberg spin triangle , and emerges for both classical and quantum spins . moreover , our theoretical calculations for each of these polytopes show that the specific heat versus @xmath0 also exhibits anomalous behavior in the vicinity of @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of this quantity for \\{@xmath5 }  at very low temperatures would be of great interest . </S>"
