    "in this work , we will propose a procedure to reduce rate models for neuron dynamics to effective one dimensional fokker - planck equations .",
    "these simplified descriptions will be obtained using the structure of the underlying stochastic dynamical system .",
    "we will emphasize the numerical and practical performance of this procedure coming from ideas used in the probability community @xcite for a particular model widely studied in the computational neuroscience literature .",
    "we will consider a simple model @xcite formed by two interacting families of neurons .",
    "we assume that there is a recurrent excitation with a higher correlation to the activity of those neurons of the same family than those of the other while a global inhibition on the whole ensemble is due to the background activity .",
    "these families of neurons are modelled through the dynamics of their firing rate equations as in the classical wilson - cowan equations @xcite .",
    "the synaptic connection coefficients @xmath0 , representing the strength of the interaction between population @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are the elements of a @xmath3 symmetric matrix @xmath4 given by @xmath5,\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 is the self - excitation of each family , @xmath7 the excitation produced on the other family , and @xmath8 the strength of the global inhibition .",
    "the typical synaptic values considered in these works are such that @xmath9 leading to cross - inhibition since @xmath10 and self - excitation since @xmath11 .",
    "let us comment that these rate models are very simplified descriptions of interacting neuron pools , more accurate microscopic models introducing neuron descriptions at the level of voltage and/or conductances probability distribution can be derived @xcite .",
    "the time evolution for the firing rates @xmath12 of the neuronal populations @xmath13 as given in @xcite follows the following stochastic differential equations ( sde ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a time relaxation coefficient , which will be chosen equal to 1 in the sequel except for the numerical results , and @xmath16 represents a white noise of normalized standard deviation @xmath17 . in the function @xmath18",
    "is a sigmoid function determining the response function of the neuron population to a mean excitation @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the external stimuli applied to each neuron population .",
    "we will recall in the next section that the study of the decision making process for the previous network can be alternatively studied by means of the evolution of a fokker - planck equation in two dimensions i.e. the plane @xmath22 .",
    "the theoretical study of such problem ( existence and uniqueness of positive solutions ) was done in @xcite .",
    "however , we will emphasize that due to slow - fast character of the underlying dynamical system the convergence towards the stationary state for the corresponding two - dimensional problem is very slow leading to a kind of metastable behavior for the transients .",
    "nevertheless , the 2d fokker - planck equation allows us to compute real transients of the network showing this metastable behavior .",
    "moreover , we can derive a simplified one dimensional sde in section 3 by scaling conveniently the variables .",
    "here , we use the spectral decomposition and the linearized slow manifold associated to some stable / unstable fixed point of the deterministic dynamical system .",
    "the obtained 1d fokker - planck equation leads to a simple problem to solve both theoretically for the stationary states and numerically for the transients . in this manner",
    ", we can reduce the dynamics on the slow manifold to the movement of a particle in an effective 1d potential with noise .",
    "we recover the slow - fast behavior in this 1d reduction but , due to dimension , we can efficiently compute its numerical solution for much larger times than the 2d .",
    "we can also directly compute an approximation to the 2d equilibrium state by the 1d equilibrium onto the slow manifold since in 1d , every drift derives from a potential .",
    "let us mention that another approach to get an approximation of the 2d fokker - planck equation by 1d fokker - planck reduced dynamics has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "this approach is purely local via taylor expansion around the bifurcation point leading to a cubic 1d effective potential .",
    "moreover , an assumption about the scaling of the noise term is performed to be able to close the expansion around the bifurcation point .",
    "our approach is valid no matter how far we are from the bifurcation point as long as the system has the slow - fast character and we do not assume any knowledge of the scaling of the noise term .",
    "moreover , we can reconstruct the full potential not only locally at the bifurcation point .",
    "we point out that the results of their 1d fokker - planck reduction are compared to experimental data in @xcite with excellent results near the bifurcation point .",
    "a similar applied analysis of our reduced fokker - planck dynamics in a system of interest in computational nuroscience is underway @xcite .",
    "section 4 is devoted to show comparisons between the 2d and the reduced 1d fokker - planck equations both for the stationary states and the transients .",
    "we demonstrate the power of this 1d reduction in the comparison between projected marginals on each firing rate variable and on the slow linearized manifold . finally , section 5 is devoted to obtain information of the simulation in terms of escaping times from a decision state and performance in the decision taken .",
    "we will illustrate all our results by numerical simulations performed with the physiological values introduced in @xcite : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 for the unbiased case and @xmath28 for the biased case .",
    "the noise parameter is chosen as @xmath29 , and the connection coefficients are given by @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the deterministic dynamical system associated with is characterized by a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation in terms of the parameter @xmath6 from a single stable asymptotic state to a two stable and one unstable equilibrium points .",
    "we recall that the unstable point is usually called spontaneous state while the two asymptotically stable points are called decision states .",
    "the behavior of the bifurcation diagram for the deterministic dynamical system defining the equilibrium points in terms of the @xmath6 parameter and with respect to @xmath34 is shown in figure [ bifurcation ] .",
    "observe that in the nonsymmetric ( @xmath35 ) bifurcations , the pair of stable / unstable equilibrium points detaches from the branch of stable points .",
    "for example , with @xmath36 in the unbiased case , if @xmath37 , the stable points are in @xmath38 and its symmetric @xmath39 , and the unstable one is in @xmath40 ; whereas , in the biased case @xmath41 the stable points are in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the unstable one in @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown by means of direct simulations of system , that there is a _ slow - fast _ behaviour of the solutions toward the equilibrium points .",
    "this behavior is plotted in figure [ nils ] , where the straight lines show the behavior of several realisations for the deterministic system ( i.e. when @xmath45 ) , and the wiggled line represent one realisation for the full stochastic system .",
    "figure [ nils ] highlights also the so called _ slow manifold _ : a curves in which the three equilibrium points of the system lie and where the dynamics are reduced to rather quickly .    applying standard methods of ito calculus ,",
    "see @xcite , we can prove that the probability density @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , satisfies a fokker - planck equation ( known also as the progressive kolmogorov equation ) .",
    "hence , @xmath49 must satisfy : @xmath50 where @xmath51 \\times [ 0,\\nu_m]$ ] , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we complete equation by the following robin boundary conditions or no flux conditions : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the outward unit normal to the domain .",
    "physically , this kind of boundary conditions means that we have no particles incoming in the domain .",
    "this is naturally relevant for the boundaries @xmath58\\times \\ { 0\\}$ ] and @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "for the two others boundaries , @xmath58\\times \\ { \\nu_m\\}$ ] and @xmath60 $ ] , it relies on the choice of @xmath61 large enough in such a way that the evolution of our system of particles is isolated . in practice , for the choosen parameters of our model",
    ", @xmath62 is a good choice .    in order to simplify notations ,",
    "let us consider , from now on , the vector field @xmath63 representing the flux in the fokker - planck equation : @xmath64 then , equation and boundary conditions read : @xmath65 @xmath66    we refer to @xcite for numerical results and a detailed mathematical analysis of the fokker - planck model - : proof of the existence , uniqueness , and positivity of the solution , and its exponential convergence towards the equilibrium , or stationary state .",
    "let us just recall that the equilibrium state can not be analytically given because the flux does not derive from a potential , i.e. it is not in gradient form .",
    "moreover , we remark that the slow - fast structure leads to stiff terms and thus , to small time steps and large computational time .",
    "in fact , the slow exponential decay to equilibrium makes impossible to wait for time evolving computations to reach the real equilibrium .",
    "hence , it is difficult to numerically analyze the effect of the various parameters of the model on the equilibrium state , and then the importance of deriving a simplified model capable of explaining the main dynamics of the original one is justified .",
    "nevertheless , one could find the equilibrium state directly by numerical methods to find eigenfunctions of elliptic equations .",
    "the discussed slow - fast behavior will serve us , in the sequel , to reduce the dynamics of the system to a one dimensional fokker - planck equation .",
    "in this section we present the one dimensional reduction of system .",
    "we shall treat first the deterministic part , see [ deterministic ] , then the stochastic terms , section [ stochastic ] , and finally we describe the one dimensional fokker - planck model , see [ fp1d ] .",
    "the slow - fast behavior can be characterized by considering the deterministic system of two ordinary differential equations , i.e. ( [ ode ] ) with @xmath45 .",
    "regardless of the stability character of the fixed point @xmath67 , the slow - fast behavior is characterized by a large condition number for the jacobian of the linearized system at the equilibrium point @xmath68 , i.e. , a small ratio between the smallest and largest eigenvalue in amplitude .",
    "more precisely , let us write the deterministic part of the dynamical system as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a vector and @xmath71 is the flux , see , as described in section [ 2dmodel ] .",
    "let us denote @xmath72 the spontaneous equilibrium point , so that @xmath73 . by spontaneous state we mean the only equilibrium before the bifurcation point and the unique unstable equilibrium point after the subcritical pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "this equilibrium point @xmath72",
    "is then parameterized by the bifurcation parameter @xmath6 and it has a jump discontinuity at the bifurcation point for nonsymmetric cases @xmath74 . hence , by construction : @xmath75 for the system ( [ ode ] ) , the linearized jacobian matrix is given by : @xmath76 where we have denoted by @xmath77 the values @xmath78 .",
    "we recall that @xmath72 is an hyperbolic fixed point ( saddle point ) after the bifurcation while before it is an asymptotically stable equilibrium .",
    "hence the jacobian @xmath79 has two real eigenvalues @xmath80 and @xmath81 being both negative before the bifurcation and of opposite signs after .",
    "the bifurcation is characterized by the point in which the smallest in magnitude eigenvalue becomes zero .",
    "let us denote by @xmath80 the ( large ) negative eigenvalue and by @xmath81 the ( small ) negative / positive eigenvalue of @xmath79 .",
    "we remark that , the small parameter @xmath82 which is responsible for the slow - fast behavior is determined by the ratio of the amplitude of the two eigenvalues : @xmath83 the values in terms of @xmath6 and for different values of @xmath84 are shown in figure [ epsilon ] . in the range of parameters we are interested with",
    ", @xmath85 is of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "note the jump discontinuities at the bifurcation point for @xmath87 since the point around which our analysis can be performed jumps to the new created branch of the bifurcation diagram at the bifurcation point .    in order to reduce the system we need to introduce a new phase space based on the linearization of the problem .",
    "we will denote by @xmath88 the matrix containing the normalized eigenvectors and by @xmath89 its inverse matrix .",
    "note that , in the unbiased case ( @xmath37 ) , we have : @xmath90 with the associated eigenvalues @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the eigenvectors are orthogonal .",
    "orthogonality of the eigenvectors is no longer true for the nonsymmetric biased problem @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , using hartman - grobman theorem @xcite , we know that the solutions of the dynamical system are topologically conjugate with its linearization in the neighbourhood of an hyperbolic fixed point , which is valid in our case for all values of the bifurcation parameter except at the pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "let us write it as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath88 is the matrix of eigenvectors and @xmath94 is the associated diagonal matrix .",
    "we can describe the coordinates @xmath70 in the eigenvector basis and centered on the saddle point @xmath72 as follows : @xmath95 which gives the definition for the new variable @xmath96 , see also figure [ chang - variable ] : @xmath97    we can conclude that system reads in the @xmath98 phase space as : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the two dimensional vector defined by : @xmath101 we remark that by means of the chain rule , the jacobian @xmath102 is given by : @xmath103 and using and that @xmath104 , we obtain that @xmath105 , which is the diagonal matrix in the change of variables .",
    "let us now make explicit the system in terms of its components @xmath106 and @xmath107 : @xmath108 where considering the definition of the flux @xmath109 given by : @xmath110 @xmath111 now , we can choose a new time scale for the fast variable @xmath112 , with @xmath85 given by , in such a way that for large time @xmath113 then the fast variable @xmath114 and the variations @xmath115 . then",
    ", the fast character of the variable @xmath116 is clarified , see similar arguments in @xcite , and the system reads as @xmath117 \\displaystyle\\frac{dy}{dt } = g(x , y ) \\end{cases}\\ , .\\ ] ] our model reduction assumption consists in assuming that the curve defined by equation @xmath118 is a good approximation when @xmath119 to the slow manifold .",
    "this manifold coincides with the unstable manifold that joins the spontaneous point @xmath72 to the two other stable equilibrium points ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) after the bifurcation point while is part of the stable manifold before the pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "due to the non - linearity of the function @xmath122 , see and , we can not expect an explicit formula for @xmath123 .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath124 , the resolution in the neighborhood of the origin is given by the implicit function theorem .",
    "hence we can define a curve : @xmath125 such that @xmath126 in a neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "we also note that , by construction the approximated slow manifold @xmath127 , implicitly defined by ( [ def_curve ] ) , intersects the exact slow manifold at all equilibrium points , i.e. where both @xmath122 and @xmath128 vanish ( nullclines ) .",
    "finally , we can conclude the slow - fast ansatz , replacing the complete dynamics by the one on the approximated slow manifold , and obtain the reduced one dimensional differential equation : @xmath129      we consider now the stochastic terms of system . when changing the variable form @xmath70 to @xmath98 , also the standard deviation of the considered brownian motion should be modified . indeed the new variables @xmath116 and @xmath130 are linear combination of @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "for instance , consider two stochastic differential eqautions : @xmath133 where @xmath134 are two independent normalized white noises and @xmath135 are the two standard deviations , and take a linear combination of @xmath131 and @xmath132 with real constant coefficients @xmath136 : @xmath137 .",
    "then @xmath116 must obey to the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath138 in our case , @xmath139 , then we have : @xmath140 or developing and considering @xmath141 , @xmath142 since in our model @xmath143 , and considering the above discussion , we can write for a white noise @xmath144 : @xmath145 finally , we conclude that the reduced one dimensional model reads : @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "we note that in the unbiased case @xmath148 , since @xmath88 is given by .",
    "we can now consider the fokker - planck ( or progressive kolmogorov ) equation associated to the one dimensional stochatic differential equation .",
    "this gives the reduced dynamics on the approximated slow manifold @xmath149 .",
    "let us remark that this reduced sde is obtained except at the bifurcation point and therefore valid whenever the slow - fast decomposition is verified or in other words whenever @xmath150 is small .",
    "consider the probability distribution function @xmath151 , for @xmath152 and @xmath153 $ ] , then it must obey to the following one dimensional fokker - planck equation : @xmath154 with no - flux boundary conditions on @xmath155 : @xmath156    since equation is one dimensional , it is always possible to find the effective potential @xmath157 being the derivative of the flux term @xmath158 .",
    "in other words , we can always define the potential function : @xmath159    moreover , we can explicitly obtain the stationary solutions of , i.e. the solutions @xmath160 independent on time @xmath161 , as follows : @xmath162 with @xmath163 a suitable normalization constant . as explained also in @xcite , these stationary solutions are the asymptotic equilibrium states for the solution of the fokker - planck equation . in other words , letting time to go to infinity , the solution @xmath151 to must converge to @xmath160 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the decay to equilibrium for the two dimensional problem was exponential .",
    "nevertheless , this decay is so slow due to the small positive eigenvalue associated to the spontaneous state that the simulation shows metastable behavior for large times .",
    "hence it is relevant to have a simple approximated computation of their asymptotic behavior without need to solve the whole 2d fokker - planck equation which is provided by this effective 1d potential .",
    "in this section , we numerically compare the solutions obtained for the one dimensional reduced fokker - planck equation to the one of the original two dimensional model .",
    "concerning the numerical scheme for the two dimensional problem , we refer the reader to the detailed description in @xcite . in particular , we are interested in the solutions at equilibrium . as announced in section [ fp1d ] , we have an explicit formula for the solution at equilibrium in 1d by computing the primitive @xmath157 . on the contrary , in the 2d setting , we can not have such formulae and the computational time to approach equilibrium is very large .    in figure [ comparison ] , we plot the solution at equilibrium of the 1d problem ( the blue line ) and compare it with the projection of the two dimensional solution on the new variable @xmath130 ( the black line ) .",
    "we remark that the black line is not too smooth since we are projecting a 2d distribution on a uniform quadrangular mesh onto an inclined straight line .",
    "we can see a good matching in the unbiased case ( @xmath27 ) . in the biased cases ,",
    "the results are different : for @xmath164 , one clearly sees that even if we have computed until the final time of @xmath165 seconds , both the 2d and the 1d solutions have not reached equilibrium and the 2d results are closer to equilibrium ; while for @xmath166 or @xmath167 , the difference is smaller since the drift is strong enough to push all particles toward only one of the equilibrium points and there is only one population bump at least for the 2d results . the 2d results are closer to equilibrium at @xmath168 while at @xmath169 the 1d are closer .    on the other way round , we can also compare the marginals obtained from the two dimensional problem with the projections of the solution for the one dimensional problem on the @xmath131 and/or @xmath132 axes . in figure [ comparison2 ] we show the comparison for various @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath170 is the most interesting case as discussed in the previous figure .",
    "in fact , for larger @xmath34 , at equilibrium , the particles are almost all concentrated around one of the two stable points .",
    "thus , no bump is visible around the second one ( even in the one dimensional reduced solution ) , and for the unbiased case the matching is excellent .",
    "we warn the reader in order to compare figures [ comparison ] and [ comparison2 ] that increasing values of @xmath130 correspond to decreasing values of @xmath131 .",
    "the results demonstrate that the 1d reduction is worth to obtain information about the behavior at equilibrium . in the next section",
    ", we shall investigate the time dependent solution @xmath171 of equation .",
    "we are here interested also on the time behavior of the solution @xmath171 of the 1d fokker - planck equation .",
    "for instance , we may compare the time evolution of momentum for the 2d and the reduced 1d problem .",
    "thus , we need to compute not only the stationary solution of equation , but also its time dependent solution .",
    "we choose to discretize equation using implicit in time finite difference method .",
    "the evolution of the 1d reduced model illustrates again the slow - fast character of this problem .",
    "in fact , we observe in figure [ evolution_y ] the evolution in time of the density @xmath171 for small ( left ) and for large ( right ) times respectively . the convergence toward the final stationary state is quite slow compared to the fast division toward the two bump distribution at the initial stages .",
    "we describe now how to recover all the moments of the partial distribution function @xmath172 in the @xmath173 plane , using the probability distribution function @xmath174 solution of and the approximated slow manifold @xmath127 .",
    "the function @xmath172 is concentrated along the the curve @xmath175 given by @xmath176 , see .",
    "we parametrized this curve by means of a curvilinear coordinate and define @xmath177 then , for any test function @xmath178 , the moment @xmath179 of the probability distribution function @xmath180 is defined by @xmath181 and given by @xmath182 this formulae can be used to compute either classical moments of @xmath172 or marginals by choosing e.g. @xmath183 to get the @xmath132-marginal as a function of @xmath184 . note that @xmath185 has to be normalized in such way that its total mass ( along the slow manifold ) is equal to @xmath186 i.e. @xmath187 .",
    "let us illustrate this metastability by the evolution of the first moments of the distribution in figure [ 1dslowfast ] .",
    "the initial data is a dirac measure located above the spontaneous point ( @xmath188 , @xmath189 small ) .",
    "we choose @xmath27 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "we use a implicit scheme in order to have no stability constraint on the time step .",
    "the number of discretization point is 200 and the time step is @xmath192 for the left plot . it shows the fast dynamics : first the dirac measure diffuses onto a gaussian blob and moves quickly toward the spontaneous ( unstable ) state , then the gaussian blob splits in the two bumps around the two stable equilibrium points .",
    "it seems that the solution has reached a equilibrium but it evolves very slowly .",
    "the figure on the right corresponds to @xmath193 and shows this slow evolution toward the real equilibrium state .",
    "we will comment more below .",
    "we can finally compare the marginals in @xmath131 for the 1d reduced model and the 2d simulations in figure [ comparisonmarg ] .",
    "we can conclude that the transients of the 2d are captured extremely well by the 1d reduced model .",
    "in the previous sections , we have numerically studied the accuracy of the reduced 1d model with respect to the 2d original one .",
    "we discuss now some other information we can obtain from the 1d problem , namely : the escaping time , section [ escaping ] , and the probability density to belong to a sub - domain of the phase space , section [ section - rho ] .      fixed a bias @xmath34 and for a variable @xmath194 we can easily compute the escaping time .",
    "in fact we recall that the kramers formula @xcite : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the maximum difference of the potential @xmath197 @xmath198 apply in the one dimensional framework , without needing to compute the solution @xmath151 of the fokker - planck equation . recall that @xmath199 corresponds to the potential value at the spontaneous state while @xmath200 corresponds to the minimum of the potential value at the two decision states . in figure [ dgg ]",
    ", we plot the potential gap computed by means of as a function of the bias @xmath34 .    in the 2d problem ,",
    "since the drift is not the gradient of a potential , kramer s rule does not apply and the escaping times can only be computed for the unbiased case , @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath27 the problem is symmetric in @xmath131 and @xmath132 and thus , we know that the firing rates will separate in two identical bumps",
    ". then , starting the computation from an initial data narrowly concentrated around one stable equilibrium point ( say @xmath120 ) , the escaping time @xmath201 can be defined as the time needed to have half of the total mass moving to a neighborhood of @xmath121 . in particular , the expectation @xmath202 has an exponential behavior and its associated potential gap is @xmath203 .",
    "of course , this kind of argument can not be extended to the biased case and thus , the 1d reduced model is essential .",
    "we can compare the value of the probability @xmath204 of the firing rates to be in some domain @xmath205 for the 2d fokker - plank model and the 1d reduced fp model .",
    "in particular , we shall compare : @xmath206 the probability for the 2d problem that at time @xmath161 the firing rates belong to @xmath207 ; with @xmath208 representing the probability for the solution of the 1d problem to belong to @xmath209 $ ] , see figure [ chang - variable ] .",
    "we fix the standard derivation @xmath210 , and let the bias @xmath84 varying from @xmath211 to @xmath212 , since the values of @xmath206 and @xmath208 for @xmath34 bigger than @xmath213 are already very close ( the relative error being of the order of @xmath214 ) .",
    "we recall that , in the 2d problem , we has to wait for a very long time in order to reach equilibrium , since we have a meta - stable situation , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the @xmath215 profile is exponentially increasing converging to an asymptotic value @xmath216",
    ". we can extrapolate this value from the values of @xmath215 for some initial iterations as follows .",

    "<S> this model arises in computational neuroscience when considering , for example , bistable visual perception problems and is based on a stochastic wilson - cowan system of differential equations . in a previous work , the slow - fast behavior of the solution of the fokker - planck equation has been highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to demonstrate that the complexity of the model can be drastically reduced using this slow - fast structure . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we can derive a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation that describes the evolution of the solution along the so - called slow manifold . </S>",
    "<S> this permits to have a direct efficient determination of the equilibrium state and its effective potential , and thus to investigate its dependencies with respect to various parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> it also allows to obtain information about the time escaping behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for the reduced 1d equation are validated with those of the original 2d equation both for equilibrium and transient behavior . </S>"
