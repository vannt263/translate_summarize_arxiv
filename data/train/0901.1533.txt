[ phasediagram ] ( a ) ) . in the phase diagram ,",
    "the co - nqr frequency @xmath10 was used as a promising reference for the ground state of the blh compounds @xcite , because the nqr frequency sensitively reflects the crystalline distortions around the co site , which are induced by the water intercalation .",

    "if the internal fields were along the @xmath5 axis , @xmath96 transition line would become the broadest within the three nqr lines . obviously , this is not a case .",
    "the anisotropic broadening of @xmath96 transitions below @xmath89 k can also be consistently explained by assuming @xmath93 .",
    "these two results suggest that the internal fields direct to the @xmath25 plane .",
    "next , the intensity of the internal fields is estimated using the relationship between the resonant frequency and the internal field strength , which is derived from the equation ( [ fn : mo ] ) . the details of the analyses are described in the separate paper@xcite . for the estimation of the fraction",
    ", we used the nqr spectra in the frequency range of @xmath97 mhz , because almost linear relationship was observed between the frequency and the internal field strength in this frequency range .",
    "the result is exhibited in the inset of fig .",
    "[ monqrsp ] .",
    "it was found that the maximum fraction is at zero field , and that rather large fraction is in the small field region .",
    "we also point out that a weak hump was observed on the fraction around @xmath98 t , which corresponds to 0.1 @xmath99 when we adopt 1.47 t@xmath100 as the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that nqr measurements were performed on the co site , where the magnetic moments are located .",
    "the distribution of the hyperfine fields at the co site suggests that the size of the ordered moments has the spatial distribution .",

    "[ shift ] ( a ) , where @xmath103 measured on the sc sample at @xmath104 t is shown together .",
    "compared with the result of the sc sample , the knight shift on the i m sample slightly increases below @xmath64 k. it seems that the magnetic structure has a ferromagnetic component , because the magnetization increases below @xmath64 k. the temperature dependence of the magnetization measured on the i m sample was presented in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "the increase in the magnetization was also observed below approximately @xmath64 k , when the external fields greater than @xmath101 t are applied .",
    "the resemblance of the temperature dependence between the bulk magnetization and the knight shift suggests that the increase in knight shift is an intrinsic behavior .",
    "in addition to the temperature dependence of @xmath105 , we investigated the temperature dependence of the spectral broadening in several fields by evaluating the spectral width at the three - quarter intensity of the highest peak .",
    "we used the full width at the three - quarter maximum ( fw3/4 m ) in order to minimize the spectral width arising from the in - plane anisotropy of the knight shift and the electric - field gradient .",
    "these contributions are small near the peak intensity .",
    "the line width estimated near the peak intensity originates mainly from the distribution of the hyperfine fields at the co site .",
    "we defined the value @xmath106 as the difference of fw3/4 m from that at @xmath101 k @xmath107 which are plotted as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "[ shift ] ( b ) .",
    "the spectral broadening due to the electric field gradient is completely canceled by subtracting the fw3/4 m at @xmath101 k , because the electric field gradient does not depend on temperatures below @xmath108 k. the temperature dependence of @xmath106 possesses the magnetic origin . at @xmath60 t , the spectral width slightly decreases below @xmath19 , because the spin susceptibility decreases in the superconducting state .",
    "the decrease in the spectral width in the superconducting state is observed when the spectral width is determined mainly by the inhomogeneity of the knight shift .",
    "this result indicates that the magnetic - field distribution generated by the vortices in the superconducting state is smaller than those arising from the distribution of knight shift even in @xmath60 t. in the fields greater than @xmath101 t , the fw3/4 m starts to increase below @xmath64 k , where the anomaly was also observed in the temperature dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "it is considered that the static internal fields cause the broadening on the nmr spectra of the i m sample .",
    "the field dependence of the onset temperature , where the spectra start to broaden , is considerably weak in the field range @xmath109 t. the fw3/4 m of the sc sample measured in @xmath104 t does not represent any anomaly at @xmath64 k , but shows a gradual increase , which is roughly proportional to the bulk susceptibility .    the spectral width at @xmath35 k @xmath110 is plotted as a function of external fields in the inset of fig .  [ shift ] ( b ) .",
    "a clear increase is observed at 4 t , and the values are saturated above 6 t. the saturated value is approximately 0.02 t , which corresponds to the ordered moment of 0.01 @xmath99 by assuming the hyperfine coupling constant being 1.47 t/@xmath111@xcite .",
    "it can be considered that the weak magnetic ordering , which possesses ordering temperature @xmath112 k , is masked by the superconductivity with @xmath71 k. the magnetism appears when the superconductivity is suppressed below @xmath18 by external magnetic fields .",
    "the emergence of the internal fields in the external magnetic fields and the clear superconducting transition in zero field indicate the intimate relationship between superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "the similar field - induced magnetism has been observed in cuprate and heavy - fermion superconductors , in which superconductivity occurs near the magnetic instability @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the spectral broadening was observed at the same time as the decrease in the knight shift due to superconductivity at 5.6 t. in this field , superconductivity coexists with magnetism within the i m sample .",
    "one might consider that the i m sample includes two different phases , which are the superconducting phase and the magnetic phase .",
    "this possibility , however , can be ruled out by the large superconducting volume fraction of the i m sample at low fields , which is comparable to the sc sample , and the obvious change in the nmr spectra at high fields .",
    "the i m sample varies the ground state depending on the external fields . at the intermediate fields @xmath113 t , superconductivity coexists with magnetism",
    "there are two candidates to comprehend the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in the i m sample .",
    "one is the uniform coexistence , where the ordered moments appear in the superconducting state .",
    "the other possibility is that the magnetism occurs in the region , where the superconductivity is suppressed , such as the vortex cores , and is apart from the superconducting region . in the present study ,",
    "the spectral broadening with magnetic origin was not observed in the superconducting state at low fields , and was suddenly observed when the superconductivity was suppressed below approximately @xmath64 k. our experimental result might suggest that the magnetism can not coexist with superconductivity uniformly , but occurs in the vortex core . however , it is difficult to observe spatial distribution of the electronic state from the broad nmr spectra of the powder samples .",
    "nmr measurements on single crystals are required to obtain the sharp nmr spectra and to investigate the spatial distributions of @xmath26 in high fields .",
    "we performed co - nqr and nmr measurements on three blh na@xmath0(h@xmath1o)@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4o   samples , which demonstrate various ground states .",
    "the experimental results presented here suggest that the superconductivity in blh compound is intimately related to the magnetism . since a subtle change in the chemical compositions strongly affects the physical properties , it is required to characterize the samples from both macroscopic and microscopic measurements .",
    "a magnetic transition was observed in zero magnetic field in the mo sample . in the mo sample",
    ", it was found that the spatially distributed internal fields appear below @xmath89 k. in the sc sample , which shows the highest @xmath12 k , the magnetic fluctuations were found to keep increasing down to @xmath35 k , when the superconductivity was suppressed by the strong magnetic fields .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath13 suggests that the sc sample is located in the vicinity of the quantum critical point . in the i m sample , which possesses the intermediate parameters ,",
