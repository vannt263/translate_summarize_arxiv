    "mckay correspondence was originally proposed in @xcite as a relation between minimal resolutions of quotient singularities @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a finite subgroup of @xmath2 and the representations of @xmath1 .",
    "shortly after that , dixon , harvey , vafa and witten ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) discovered a formula for the euler characteristic of certain resolutions of quotients :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is a complex manifold , @xmath5 is a resolution of singularities such that @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the submanifold of @xmath4 of points fixed by both @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the right hand side in ( [ eulercommuting ] ) can be written as the sum ofver the conjugacy classes : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the centralizer of @xmath9 which for @xmath12 is the number of irreducible representations of @xmath1 . at the same time , the other side in ( [ eulercommuting ] ) is the number of exceptional curves in minimal resolution plus @xmath13 and one obtains mckay correspondence on the numerology level ( cf .",
    "mckay correspondence became the subject of intense study and the term is now primarily used to indicate a relationship between the various invariants of the actions of finite automorphism groups on quasiprojective varieties and resolutions of the corresponding quotients by such actions generalizing ( [ eulercommuting ] ) .",
    "we refer to the report @xcite for a survey of evolution of ideas since original empirical observation of mckay .",
    "one of the main results to date on the relationship between the invariants of actions and resolutions of quotients is the description of the @xmath14-function of a crepant resolution in terms of the invariants of the action ( cf @xcite , @xcite ) ) .",
    "we recall that for a quasiprojective variety @xmath15 its @xmath14-function is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the hodge numbers of the deligne s mixed hodge structure on the compactly supported cohomology of @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath14-function incorporates many classical numerical invariants of manifolds .",
    "for example , if @xmath15 is a projective manifold and @xmath18 one obtains hirzebruch s @xmath19-genus which in turn has topological and holomorphic euler characteristics and signature as its special values .    in @xcite , batyrev extended the definition of @xmath14-function to the case of global quotient of a variety @xmath15 by a finite group @xmath1 .",
    "he defined the orbifold @xmath14-function , @xmath20 in terms of the action of a finite group @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , he extended this definition to @xmath1-normal pairs @xmath21 that consist of a variety @xmath15 and a simple normal crossing @xmath1-equivariant divisor @xmath22 on it .",
    "batyrev showed that the @xmath14-function of the pair @xmath23 consisting of a resolution @xmath24 and the divisor defined via the discrepancy @xmath25 ( with trivial group action ) coincides with the orbifold @xmath14-function .",
    "the fact that @xmath14-function of the pair does nt change under birational morphisms , as well as an alternative proof of mckay correspondence for @xmath14-functions are based on kontsevich s idea of motivic integration ( cf.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another generalization of hirzebruch s @xmath19-genus is the ( two - variable ) elliptic genus , and this paper grew from an attempt to prove the relationship between elliptic genera of resolutions of the quotients @xmath26 and the elliptic genera associated with the actions of @xmath1 on @xmath15 .",
    "these two versions of elliptic genus of a global quotient were introduced in our previous paper @xcite where the mckay correspondence was stated as a conjecture .",
    "the proof given below , similarly to batyrev s approach , requires a generalization of elliptic genera considered in @xcite to the elliptic genus associated with triples consisting of a manifold , the group acting on it and the divisor with simple normal crossings .",
    "elliptic genus was extensively studied in recent years ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite and further references in the latter ) . for an almost complex compact manifold @xmath4 with chern roots",
    "@xmath27 ( i.e. the total chern class is @xmath28 ) the elliptic genus can be defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the classical theta function ( cf .",

    "alternatively , the elliptic genus can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 here @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) is complex tangent ( resp .",
    "cotangent ) bundle and as usual for a bundle @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote generating functions for exterior and symmetric powers of @xmath37 ( by riemann roch this is also the holomorphic euler characteristic of @xmath40 ) .",
    "elliptic genus of a projective manifold is a holomorphic function of @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath42 then it is a weak jacobi form ( of weight @xmath43 and index @xmath44 , see @xcite or earlier references in @xcite ) .    since @xmath45 , hirzebruch s @xmath19-genus is a specialization of the elliptic genus ( and so are various one variable versions of elliptic genus due to landweber - stong , ochanine , witten and hirzebruch ) . on the other hand ,",
    "elliptic genus is a combination of chern numbers of @xmath4 , as is apparent from , but it can not be expressed via hodge numbers of @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the information about elliptic genera of resolutions of @xmath46 can not be derived from corresponding information about @xmath14-function , though it can be done for specialization @xmath47 of the elliptic genus . since elliptic genus depends only on the chern numbers , it is a cobordism invariant .",
    "totaro @xcite found a characterization of the elliptic genus of @xmath48-manifolds from the point of view of cobordisms as the universal genus invariant under classical flops .",
    "a major difference between elliptic genus and @xmath14-function is that the latter is defined for quasiprojective varieties .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt know if a useful definition of elliptic genus can be given for arbitrary quasiprojective manifolds . moreover , while @xmath14-function enjoys strong additivity properties there appears to be no analog of them in the case of elliptic genus .",
    "additivity allows one to work with @xmath14-functions not just in the category of manifolds but in the category of of arbitrary quasiprojective varieties .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite ( extending @xcite ) a definition of elliptic genus for some singular spaces was proposed as follows .",

    "if the canonical classes of @xmath4 and @xmath52 are related via @xmath53 then @xmath54 is independent of a resolution @xmath55 ( here @xmath56 are the cohomology classes of the components @xmath57 of the exceptional divisor and @xmath58 are the chern roots of @xmath52 ) and depends only on @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath59 was called _ singular elliptic genus _ of @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath47 , singular elliptic genus specializes to the singular @xmath19-genus calculated from batyrev s @xmath14-function .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further discussion of this invariant .    on the other hand , for a finite group @xmath1 of automorphisms of a manifold @xmath4 , an _ orbifold elliptic genus _ was defined in @xcite in terms of the action of @xmath1 on @xmath4 as follows . for a pair of commuting elements @xmath60 , let @xmath61 be a connected component of the fixed point set of both @xmath9 and @xmath62 .",

    "second main ingredient of the proof is the pushforward formula for the class in for toroidal morphisms .",
