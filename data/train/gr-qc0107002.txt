    "the general relativistic clock effect , as worked out in , consists in the difference in the orbital periods of two clocks moving in opposite directions along a circular equatorial orbit around a central rotating mass .",
    "it is not an easy task to derive the general effect within the framework of einstein s theory of gravitation ; in fact , for orbits of arbitrary inclination to the equatorial plane , the clock effect has been derived only for the case that the orbiting bodies describe spherical orbits of constant `` radius '' .",
    "moreover , the case of elliptical orbits has not yet been investigated .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative derivation of this effect for orbits with zero eccentricity , in order to make its comprehension more intuitive by stressing and elucidating the analogies and differences between the weak - field and slow - motion approximation of general relativity and electromagnetism .",
    "general expressions are given for arbitrary values of inclination as well .",
    "they are useful in view of the recent efforts devoted to exploring the possibility of measuring the clock effect by means of artificial near - earth satellites .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we deal with an electromagnetic system consisting of two test charges orbiting in opposite directions , acted upon by a central electric field and by a weaker orthogonal magnetic field . the latter is treated perturbatively to first order .",
    "radiative and @xmath1 effects in such a system are neglected in order to outline the main features common to the gravitational case that is treated in section 3 . in this work",
    "the gravitomagnetic force is viewed classically as a non - central small linear perturbation of the main central newtonian gravitoelectric monopole force .",
    "section 4 contains concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider two identical point charges @xmath2 of mass @xmath3 orbiting a central spherically symmetric distribution of total charge @xmath4 of opposite sign , e.g. @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we suppose that the two charges follow identical but opposite closed circular orbits and denote the speeds of the counterclockwise and clockwise moving charges by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , i.e. we assume the counterclockwise direction to be positive . in cylindrical coordinates @xmath9 , the equation of motion of the two charges reads m=|q|e , with @xmath10 and both charges describe a complete orbit in the same time @xmath11",
    "t^(0)===2= 2,where it should be noted that the mean motion ( i.e. orbital frequency ) @xmath12 depends on the charge - to - mass ratio @xmath13 .",
    "if we switch on a magnetic field @xmath14 orthogonal to the plane of motion , the two charges will experience an additional lorentz force @xmath15 , which for @xmath6 will be antiparallel to the electric field for the counterclockwise moving charge and parallel to the electric field for the clockwise moving charge .",
    "hence the equation of motion for @xmath6 becomes m= qe v_b , and therefore ( v_)^2 = ( n^2 + ) ^2 .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is weak ; therefore , we can neglect the square of the larmor frequency @xmath16 in comparison with the square of the orbital frequency @xmath17 in and obtain @xmath18 , i.e. ( ) _ = ( n),or dt_=(1).by integrating from 0 to @xmath19 for the counterclockwise orbit and @xmath19 to 0 for the clockwise orbit , we find the orbital periods of the two charges t_=(1)=t^(0),and hence their difference after one revolution t_+-t_-=.    by inspection of we see that the magnetic correction to the orbital period is independent of the charge - to - mass ratio of the orbiting electric charges , in contrast to the unperturbed period @xmath11 . indeed we could have started section 2 with the less restrictive assumption that the two charges only have the same charge - to - mass ratio .",
    "it is interesting to observe that is an exact consequence of , i.e. the weak - field approximation is unnecessary for the validity of this relation .",
    "this circumstance has an analogue in the gravitational case discussed in section 3 ; that is , below turns out to be exact for circular orbits in the equatorial plane of the exterior kerr spacetime .",
    "let us now assume that the two charges are far away from the central charge and current distributions so that the magnetic field can be considered to be generated by a magnetic dipole @xmath20 of magnitude @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the surface area of the loop enclosed by the current @xmath23 and therefore b=,e=,which , upon inserting into yield t_+-t_-=. this time difference depends on both the sign of the charges and on the direction of the magnetic field . upon exchanging the signs of @xmath4 and @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the counterclockwise revolving charge will move faster while the clockwise moving charge will move slower .",
    "however , as expected by charge symmetry , will be unaffected if the signs of the charges and of the magnetic field are reversed simultaneously .",
    "further , we note that the radius of the orbit does not appear in and that this time difference can be interpreted as a consequence of the fact that the speed of light has a finite value ; indeed , for @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the main considerations of this section are related , via the larmor theorem , to certain interesting phenomena in rotating frames of reference .",
    "orbits of charged particles off the equatorial plane are no longer spatially closed in general because their instantaneous planes undergo larmor precession induced by the magnetic field and it will thus be necessary to define the relevant periods @xmath28 in terms of azimuthal closure involving a complete loop in the @xmath29 coordinate . for the description of such a configuration it is useful to introduce the local frame attached to the moving particle , where @xmath30 denote its orthogonal unit vectors related to the radial , along - track and cross - track directions , respectively .",
    "in fact , @xmath31 denotes the orthogonal direction , in the instantaneous orbital plane , to the radial one ; in general , it does not coincide with the direction along the track unless one considers circular orbits .",
    "we will return to the case of spherical orbits in section 4 , where the local frame described here is employed along the unperturbed orbit .",
    "the electromagnetic scenario previously described is analogous to the following gravitational one : let us consider a central spherically symmetric mass @xmath32 rotating slowly with its proper angular momentum directed along the @xmath33-axis , @xmath34 , of an asymptotically inertial frame whose @xmath35-plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the gravitating source , and a pair of test bodies orbiting along a circular equatorial path in opposite directions .",
    "further , we assume that the radius @xmath36 of the orbits is much larger than the schwarzschild radius @xmath37 of the central body ; this would apply to an experiment in the field of the earth , for instance .",
    "it is well known that in the weak - field and slow - motion approximation of general relativity the stationary spacetime metric of a rotating `` spherically symmetric '' mass - energy distribution generates the so - called gravitoelectric and fields",
    "_ g=-_r,_g=_g=,with the  potential given by _",
    "g=-.at this point",
    "the calculations follow closely those of the electromagnetic case previously examined in section 2 because the equation of motion of a test body in the `` weak '' gravitational field of a general stationary axisymmetric mass - energy distribution is analogous to that of a point charge @xmath2 acted upon by electric and magnetic fields * e * and * b * , m*a*_g = m(*e*_g+_g).therefore , by reasoning as in the electromagnetic case for circular orbits with zero inclination ( section 2 ) , we obtain t_+-t_-=.    for equatorial circular orbits , eq .",
    "( [ opl ] ) immediately yields _ g=.by inserting @xmath38 and @xmath39 from eqs .",
    "( [ eg ] ) and ( [ gcb ] ) into we obtain the well - known expression t_+-t_-=4 .    it is an interesting feature of that the mass moving in the same sense of rotation as the central mass moves slower than the mass moving in the opposite direction .",
    "if we reversed the sense of rotation of the central gravitating source , the clockwise moving test mass would be slower . in this way",
    "the sense of rotation of the central mass is no longer a matter of convention but could be related to a physical phenomenon , i.e. the mass loop moving slower .",
    "also in this case , in the limit @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "an interesting feature of gravitoelectromagnetism is the gravitational larmor theorem according to which gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields are locally equivalent to translational and rotational accelerations of an observer in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the gravitational larmor theorem is therefore in effect einstein s principle of equivalence in the gravitoelectromagnetic context .",
    "note that in the gravitoelectric keplerian periods @xmath40 cancel out , no matter what the masses of the orbiting particles are , in accordance with the equivalence principle and in contrast to the electromagnetic case , where the unperturbed periods depend on the charge - to - mass ratio of the particles .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the  correction to the unperturbed keplerian period is independent of the radius of the orbit , a feature also common to the electrodynamic case .",
    "moreover , the newtonian constant @xmath41 does not appear in : this fact may account for the unexpectedly large value of the time shift in the field of the earth which amounts to about @xmath42 s. in some sense , this classical effect is a gravitomagnetic analog of the topological aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "it turns out that if we deal with the _ proper _ periods of the test bodies , i.e. the periods according to comoving clocks , then the result is the same as in eq .",
    "( 17 ) up to terms of order @xmath0 that depend on @xmath41 and @xmath36 .",
    "if the orbital plane has an arbitrary inclination @xmath43 to the equatorial plane of , a similar reasoning as in section 2 holds : the orbital plane undergoes lense - thirring precession , which is the gravitational analog of the magnetic larmor precession .",
    "let us imagine that in the absence of the gravitomagnetic field , the orbit is a circle of radius @xmath44 in a fixed plane that is inclined with respect to the equatorial @xmath35-plane by the inclination angle @xmath43 ; that is , the normal to the orbital plane is tilted away from the @xmath33-axis by the angle @xmath43 . moreover , the longitude of the ascending node is given by the azimuthal angle @xmath45 , as in figure 1 . once the gravitomagnetic field is `` turned on , '' the orbit will twist out of this fixed plane .    in order to derive analytically the time @xmath46 needed to pass from @xmath47 at @xmath48 to @xmath49 at @xmath50 in the equatorial plane of the inertial observer",
    "we will use the following reference frames : the asymptotically inertial frame @xmath51 previously defined and a frame @xmath52 with the @xmath53-axis directed along the orbital angular momentum @xmath54 of the unperturbed test body , where the @xmath55-plane coincides with the unperturbed orbital plane of the test particle and the @xmath56-axis is directed along the line of nodes . @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath57 have the same origin located at the center - of - mass of the central body .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath58 for the change of coordinates from @xmath57 to @xmath51 is given by _",
    "xx=.our calculation for the azimuthal period @xmath46 will be valid for a counterclockwise orbit as in figure 1 ; however , it is clear from the symmetry of the configuration that the result for the clockwise case ( @xmath59 ) can be simply obtained from our result by reversing the sign of the perturbation term in @xmath60 . in the asymptotically inertial frame ,",
    "let us choose cylindrical coordinates @xmath61 and write in these coordinates .",
    "the unperturbed orbit is given by @xmath62 constant , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ) .",
    "since we will consider the gravitomagnetic acceleration @xmath66 as a small perturbation of the main gravitoelectric monopole term @xmath67 , we evaluate the disturbing acceleration with respect to the unperturbed orbit . by using eqs .",
    "( [ eg ] ) and ( [ opl ] ) , can be written as    @xmath68    here the radial and along - track components of the acceleration are given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "note that in we retain @xmath53 , because due to the gravitomagnetic non - central acceleration , the motion is no longer confined to a plane and therefore @xmath53 will be proportional to the gravitomagnetic perturbation and treated to first order .",
    "for a spherical orbit @xmath36 remains constant to first order ; therefore , from we obtain = _ 0+nt - t+,where @xmath71 .",
    "it follows from the linear dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( 22 ) that eq .",
    "( 20 ) is satisfied .",
    "the solution of reads z=-2t+k_1nt+k_2nt , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constants of integration .",
    "if we assume that at @xmath48 the perturbed orbit agrees with the unperturbed orbit , i.e. @xmath76 , then @xmath77 and we will treat @xmath74 to first order of the perturbation in what follows .",
    "let us write the general solution of as @xmath78 and @xmath79 together with . by using @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we find x=+t , y =- t , z=-2t+k_1nt.from these equations we obtain by means of the transformation ( [ mat ] ) the solution in @xmath82 , @xmath83 + t[+(^2i-2",
    "^ 2i)],@xmath84 + t[-(^2i-2 ^ 2i)],z=+k_1nt - t2i.the temporal behavior of the azimuthal angle @xmath29 can be obtained via = , and the time @xmath46 needed to pass from @xmath47 at @xmath48 to @xmath49 at @xmath50 follows upon expanding the relation _ 0=(_0 + 2),where _ 0==,and ( _ 0 + 2)=.since the deviation from the unperturbed kepler period @xmath85 will be small , let us write t=(1+),with @xmath86 and further nt=(2 + 2)2,(t)=(_0+nt)=(_0 + 2 + 2)_0 - 2_0,(t)=(_0+nt)=(_0 + 2 + 2)_0 + 2_0.therefore , in the calculations for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , terms proportional to @xmath89 , due to , will be of second order and will be neglected .",
    "hence we find @xmath90 + 2[_0+(^2i-2 ^ 2i)_0],@xmath91 + 2[_0-(^2i-2 ^ 2i)_0].using and , we find after some algebra = ( 1 - 2 ^ 2i^2_0).as expected , @xmath92 is proportional to @xmath93 and vanishes for a nonrotating source . by means of it",
    "finally follows that t_=[1(1 - 2 ^ 2i ^2_0)],or t_+-t_-=4(1 - 2  ^2i ^2_0 ) .",
    "let us note that for @xmath94 , we recover the result of section 3 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath92 diverges for @xmath95 .",
    "it follows from general relativity that for a geodesic ( spherical ) polar orbit , the clock effect disappears since the angular momentum vector of the source in effect lies in the orbital plane .",
    "the orbital period is then simply given by the gravitoelectric keplerian period .",
    "on the other hand , the period for _ azimuthal closure _ is given by @xmath96 , which is very long compared to the keplerian period .",
    "this circumstance is reflected in our first - order perturbative result given by eq .",
    "( 41 ) : for @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( 41 ) , the inclination angle @xmath43 must be sufficiently less than @xmath98 such that the perturbative treatment in section 4 remains valid .",
    "an important feature of eq .",
    "( 41 ) is that when @xmath99 depends upon @xmath100 , i.e. the clock effect depends in general on the position of the mass @xmath3 along the orbit at @xmath101 .",
    "this dependence of the clock effect on where the mass @xmath3 is along the orbit when the timing observations begin is illustrated in fig . 2 and could be helpful in the detection of this effect .",
    "up to now we have assumed that when unperturbed the two satellites orbit along opposite directions in the same plane with arbitrary inclination @xmath43 .",
    "let us now consider the case of two masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 having the same distance from the center but moving in different orbital planes , say @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . following the same reasoning as before , their orbital periods , as viewed by a static , asymptotically inertial observer and after choosing suitably @xmath106 so that @xmath107 , can be written as t_- = t^(0)+2,t_- = t^(0)-2 . from these expressions",
    ", we immediately find t_--t_- = 2(+),t_-+t_- = 2t^(0)+2(- ) .    from it",
    "is seen that the sum of the orbital periods of the two point masses will also show a gravitomagnetic contribution provided the inclinations of the two satellites are different .",
    "note that reduces correctly to if the two orbital planes coincide , while in the gravitomagnetic contribution vanishes .",
    "moreover , a very interesting feature arises for supplementary inclinations of the two satellites , i.e. @xmath108 ; indeed , in this case become t_--t_- = 0,t_-+t_- = 2t^(0)+4 .",
    "one of the most striking implications of is that the lares mission , originally proposed to detect the lense - thirring drag of the orbital plane , could also be used to detect the gravitomagnetic contribution to the sum of the orbital periods .",
    "however , due to the present uncertainty of the value of @xmath109 , the error in the unperturbed keplerian period of the lageos satellite is larger than the effect to be measured t^(0)=1.5210 ^ -5  s,4i_+ = 4.7110 ^ -8  s.therefore , an improvement of our knowledge of @xmath110 would be necessary before any observables involving the sum of the unperturbed orbital periods and of the gravitomagnetic corrections may become detectable .",
    "finally , these results suggest that the gravitomagnetic clock effect may be enhanced by considering suitable constellations of satellites orbiting the earth .",
    "exploiting the formal analogy between the law of motion of a charged particle acted upon by an electromagnetic field and the weak - field and slow - motion approximation of general relativity ( `` gravitoelectromagnetism '' ) , it has been possible to derive in a simple fashion the gravitomagnetic clock effect for a couple of point masses following spherical orbits in space .",
    "general expressions for arbitrary values of inclination angle to the equatorial plane are given for these spherical orbits .",
    "these results have been obtained by neglecting terms of @xmath111 ; in this way , is equally valid for proper periods of comoving clocks .",
    "if the two satellites orbit in planes with different inclinations , the sum of their orbital periods also exhibits a gravitomagnetic part .",
    "it is worth - while to compare our main result with the corresponding general relativistic expression ( see p. 143 , eqs .",
    "( 36)-(37 ) ) , t_+-t_-=4^,where",
    "^=-3_0_0=_0 - 2 _ 0 ^ -1 ^ 2 ^ 2_0 -3_0_0.here , @xmath112 and @xmath113 must be replaced by @xmath43 and @xmath114 , respectively , and @xmath115 , @xmath116 provided that terms of @xmath111 are neglected .",
    "for the proper periods of comoving clocks an equation similar to holds , except that @xmath117 must be replaced by @xmath118 . note that these results have been obtained in a perturbative way and hold only for @xmath119 sufficiently different from @xmath98 .",
    "thus our approach gives the same result for @xmath120 as general relativity once terms of order @xmath0 are neglected .",
    "as it is for all general relativistic effects , the observation of the gravitomagnetic clock effect is a tremendously difficult undertaking as well .",
    "this becomes immediately clear by noting that for a near - earth orbit ( @xmath121 s ) a time variation of @xmath122 ns can be caused equally well by a radial or azimuthal deviation of @xmath123 mm from the ideal orbit and therefore all forces that may produce accelerations larger than @xmath124 m / s@xmath125 must be taken into account .",
    "the empirical verification of the clock effect essentially faces two problems : ( a ) to measure with the utmost precision the actual position of the satellites , ( b ) to model with extreme accuracy all perturbing forces which will influence the period of the satellites . for a single orbit ,",
    "this goal is certainly unattainable , but it may become feasible after a sufficiently long time of observation due to the accumulative character of the clock effect .",
    "while the present satellite - to - satellite tracking techniques allow the determination of an orbit with an accuracy of @xmath126 cm so that a minimum of @xmath127 revolutions will be needed for the clock effect to become detectable , the consideration of the perturbing forces at the required level is quite demanding .",
    "non - gravitational perturbations may be overcome by means of modern drag - free technology ; however , the correct determination of all gravitational effects is limited by the accuracy of the respective earth gravity field models that are currently available .",
    "preliminary results suggest that it is in particular the uncertainty in the even zonal harmonics of the spherical expansion of the terrestrial gravitational field as well as the zonal tidal perturbations that presently inhibits the successful realization of the clock experiment .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that upcoming geodetic space missions ( especially grace and goce ) are expected to improve significantly the accuracy of the gravity field of the earth and may then allow the observation of the gravitomagnetic clock effect within a few percent accuracy .",
