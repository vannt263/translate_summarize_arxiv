    "the pleiades was recognized in the 1980 s as the best open cluster to attempt to identify brown dwarfs ( stauffer 1989 ; jameson & skillen 1989 ) because of its fortuitous combination of proximity , youth and richness .",
    "a number of brown dwarf candidates were identified in those and subsequent papers , usually on the basis of photometry obtained from deep imaging surveys in two or more colors .",
    "a means to establish that a candidate brown dwarf was at least near , if not necessarily below , the hydrogen burning mass limit was proposed by rebolo , martn and magazz ( 1992 ; hereafter rmm ) . below about 0.065",
    ", brown dwarfs should never develop core temperatures sufficient for lithium ignition , and thus for objects less massive than this we should find a lithium abundance the same as for the interstellar medium from which the object formed , independent of the object s age . for slightly higher masses , lithium acts as an age scale because the length of time it takes for the core to reach 2.5x10@xmath5  k is a sensitive function of mass .",
    "because these stars are fully convective , once the core temperature exceeds the necessary limit , the entire lithium content of the star should be exhausted rapidly and thus be reflected in an observable change in the photospheric lithium abundance .",
    "the current generation of theoretical models make specific predictions about the time evolution of this lithium depletion boundary . for example",
    ", dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) predict that at ages 30 , 70 and 140 myr , the lithium depletion edge should occur at 0.17 , 0.09  and 0.07 , respectively .",
    "other recent models by baraffe ( 1998 ) and burrows ( 1997 ) make nearly identical predictions of the variation of this lithium depletion boundary with age .",
    "indeed , bildsten ( 1997 ) and others have argued that the age for an open cluster derived in this manner should be better than by any other method .",
    "the initial attempts to detect lithium in very low mass open cluster members were not successful ( rmm ; marcy , basri & graham 1994 ; hereafter mbg94 ) .",
    "however , basri , marcy & graham ( 1996 ; hereafter bmg96 ) eventually detected lithium in ppl 15 , a pleiades brown dwarf candidate originally identified by stauffer , hamilton & probst ( 1994 ) .",
    "rebolo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) later showed that two other pleiades members about 1 magnitude fainter than ppl 15 also have strong lithium absorption .",
    "bmg96 derived an age for the pleiades based on the presence of lithium in ppl 15 but the absence of lithium in another only slightly brighter pleiades member ( hhj3 ) .",
    "however , basri & martn ( 1998 ) have recently provided evidence that suggests that ppl 15 is a nearly equal - mass spectroscopic binary and thus its individual components would be @xmath60.75 mag fainter .",
    "this allows the location of the lithium boundary to be considerably fainter than had been assumed .",
    "the published data therefore no longer constrain the age of the pleiades nearly as well as one would like because too few stars have been measured spectroscopically in the magnitude range of interest .    in this paper , we report on the results of a program to determine lithium abundances for a number of candidate pleiades members with apparent magnitudes chosen to bracket the possible magnitude range within which the lithium depletion boundary might be located .",
    "we obtained spectra of our pleiades brown dwarf candidates with the keck ii low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the nights of dec .",
    "3 - 5 , 1997 . we used a 1200 l / mm grating and a one arcsecond slit .",
    "the resultant dispersion was 0.63 @xmath2/pixel , and the measured spectral resolution was about 2.0 @xmath2 .",
    "the wavelength region observed was @xmath7 6375 - 7650 @xmath2 .",
    "the primary source from which we selected target objects was the recently completed deep imaging survey of the pleiades conducted by bouvier ( 1998 ) .",
    "bouvier identified 18 objects from that survey as good candidate pleiades brown dwarfs based on their location in an i@xmath0  vs. ( r - i)@xmath0 color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we obtained keck spectra of seven of those candidates , with i magnitudes chosen to bracket the expected location of the lithium depletion edge .",
    "in addition , we obtained spectra of one target each from four other pleiades brown dwarf imaging surveys ( stauffer 1989 ; schultz 1998 ; stauffer 1998a ; zapatero - osorio 1997 ) , again selecting objects whose i magnitudes indicated they would help define the lithium depletion edge .    to first order ,",
    "all of our spectra look the same - they have strong tio and vo molecular bands indicative of spectral types m6 to m8 , and all of the stars we consider to be likely pleiades members have moderately strong   emission .",
    "they do show differences in their lithium abundances , however .",
    "figure 1 shows a close - up of the lithium @xmath16708@xmath2  region for three increasingly cooler pleiades members , illustrating that at m6.5 we do not detect lithium at good s / n , that lithium is detected as a weak feature at m7 and that at later spectral types it is generally seen quite strongly in absorption .",
    "we have used our spectra to provide the following quantitative information for our target objects : ( a )  and lithium equivalent widths ; ( b ) spectral indices which measure the continuum shape from 7000@xmath2  to 7500@xmath2  ( pc2 - see martn 1996 ) and the depth of the vo band centered around 7450@xmath2(kirkpatrick et al . 1995 ) ; and ( c ) radial velocities derived both from gaussian fits to the  emission feature ( the strongest , best defined feature in the spectra ) and from cross - correlation of the region from 6580@xmath2  to 7050@xmath2  versus gl905 - a dm5.5 standard .",
    "table 1 provides the relevant photometric and spectroscopic data for our target stars .",
    "columns 2 and 3 provide i@xmath3  and ( r - i)@xmath3   photometry from bouvier  ( 1998 ) for the cfht stars and from the papers cited above for the other stars , where the  0 \" subscript indicates that we have corrected the observed photometry for an assumed reddening of a@xmath8 = 0.06 and e(r - i ) = 0.03 ( stauffer & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "columns 4 and 5 are the pc2 and vo spectral indices , while column 6 is our spectral type derived from these indices using the stars in kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and martn ( 1996 ) as standards .",
    "we have used gliese catalog m dwarfs to define a linear relation between pc2 and ( r - i)@xmath0 : ( r - i)@xmath0  = 0.746 x pc2 + 0.65 ( see stauffer et al .",
    "1998b for details ) .",
    "these spectroscopic r - i colors are provided in column 7 of table 1 .",
    "the last two columns of the table are the measured lithium and  equivalent widths .",
    "we will report the radial velocities and some other information derived from these spectra , including lithium abundances , in a subsequent paper ( stauffer 1998b ) .    in the next section",
    ", we will present a color - magnitude diagram for the late - type pleiades members for which there exists high quality lithium equivalent width estimates .",
    "we can not do this using measured photometric colors because the appropriate photometry does not exist [ that is , some of the stars have ( r - i)@xmath0  colors , some have i - k colors but there is no single color where all of the stars have measured photometry ] .",
    "however , all of the stars have ( r - i)@xmath0colors estimated from spectroscopy or have spectral indices from which ( r - i)@xmath0  colors can be inferred .",
    "we therefore will use spectroscopic ( r - i)@xmath0  colors in that figure .",
    "comparison of the photometric and spectroscopic estimates of ( r - i)@xmath0  for the seven cfht stars in table 1 suggests that this is an acceptable procedure .",
    "it is also necessary to know whether the objects we have observed are pleiades members or not . as discussed in bouvier ( 1998 ) , the probability that a photometric candidate from the cfht survey will indeed be a pleiades member , as estimated simply from the expected field star contamination given the area and depth surveyed , is fairly good - @xmath670%  or better .",
    "if in addition the object has a spectral type that agrees with the photometric color , has  emission strength that matches what is expected for very low mass pleiades members ( stauffer , liebert and giampapa 1995 ) , and has detected lithium - indicating an age @xmath9 1 gyr for stars in this spectral type range - then we believe that the object is almost certainly a pleiades member .",
    "non - detection of lithium fainter than the i@xmath0  magnitude where other pleiades members have detected lithium would suggest the object is a non - member . for brighter candidate pleiades members , lithium is not useful but radial velocities can provide further evidence in support of pleiades membership .",
    "in fact , all of the stars in table 1 except cfht - pl-14 have radial velocities compatible with pleiades membership within the expected accuracy of our measurements ( @xmath64 , 1@xmath10 , for the velocities derived from , @xmath68 , 1@xmath10 , for the cross - correlation velocities ) .",
    "cfht - pl-14 also lacks  emission and has no measurable lithium feature .",
    "we therefore assume that all of the stars in table 1 are pleiades members except for cfht - pl-14 , which we assume is a non - member .",
    "the goal of this project was to precisely determine the location of the lithium depletion edge in the pleiades , and hence to determine an accurate age for the cluster .",
    "figure 2 shows a color - magnitude diagram for very low mass pleiades members for which lithium data are available .",
    "the lithium data are from oppenheimer ( 1997 = opp97 ) , mbg94 , bmg96 , rebolo ( 1996 = reb96 ) and from this paper .",
    "the ( r - i)@xmath0  colors for the opp97 stars are from stauffer ( 1995 ) , where we have converted these spectroscopic ( v - i)@xmath0  colors to ( r - i)@xmath0  via a relation derived from the gliese catalog m dwarfs in leggett ( 1992 ) .",
    "the ( r - i)@xmath0  colors for some stars in reb96 and bmg96 are from pc2 indices provided by martn ( 1996 ) and our calibration of pc2 vs. ( r - i)@xmath0 .",
    "two points for cfht - pl-15 are shown : ( r - i)@xmath0  = 2.24 as derived from its pc2 index , and ( r - i)@xmath0 = 2.41 as derived from its vo index .",
    "using either color , cfht - pl-15 lies below the main sequence defined by the other stars , possibly indicating that it is a non - member . because it has detected lithium and a radial velocity compatible with pleiades membership , we prefer to believe it is a member and that the inferred color is anomalous ( either intrinsically or due to measurement error ) .",
    "our primary conclusions are unaffected by how we interpret this star .",
    "finally , the dashed line in figure 2 is a field star zams derived from the m dwarf photometry provided by leggett ( 1992 ) .",
    "the location of the stars in figure 2 show a well - defined correlation with the measured lithium equivalent widths .",
    "bluer than ( r - i)@xmath0  = 2.2 , none of the stars have detected lithium while redder than that color all of the measured stars have lithium .",
    "similarly , fainter than i@xmath3  = 17.8 all the stars have detected lithium , whereas brighter than that limit all but one of the stars have no lithium .",
    "finally , there is a trend for lithium equivalent width to increase going to lower inferred mass ( i.e. fainter and redder ) .",
    "we further believe that the dispersion in i magnitude at a given color is to a large extent real and is primarily an indication that some of the observed stars are photometric binaries .",
    "in particular , we suggest that hhj6 ( i@xmath3  = 16.93 , r - i@xmath0  = 2.18 ) , lick - pl1 , ppl1 , and cfht - pl-12 are good candidates to be photometric binaries .",
    "cfht - pl-12 also has considerably stronger  emission than the other pleiades stars observed - possibly indicating it is a short - period binary or that we have observed it during a flare .",
    "the attribution of ppl1 as a nearly equal mass binary would explain why it has strong lithium absorption despite an i@xmath0  magnitude equal to or brighter than two other cluster members with no detected lithium .",
    "an alternative explanation would be that there is a significant age spread in the pleiades and these four over - luminous stars are the youngest in our sample . by comparison to theoretical models ( e.g. dantona & mazzitelli 1997 ) , their displacement about 0.5 mag above other stars of the same color would require them to be more than 50 myr younger than the other stars , which we believe is unlikely ( see , for example , discussions of this issue by soderblom 1993 and steele & jameson 1995 ) .    based on the above interpretation of figure 2",
    ", we determine that the single star lithium depletion edge in the pleiades is at i@xmath3  = 17.8 @xmath11 0.1 or ( r - i)@xmath3   = 2.20 @xmath11 0.05 .",
    "the uncertainty estimates are not rigorous , and arise mostly from the uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the photometry in bouvier ( 1998 ) . for theoretical evolutionary models which incorporate realistic model atmospheres as their outer boundary condition , and hence which can predict observational colors and magnitudes for brown dwarfs , it is possible to convert directly the empirical lithium depletion edge to an age estimate for the pleaides . in figure 3 , we plot the absolute i@xmath0  magnitude of the lithium depletion boundary ( defined here as the point where lithium has been depleted by a factor of 100 ) for the most recent models of baraffe ( 1998 ) as a function of age .",
    "to place our empirically measured point into this diagram , we assume that the cluster has ( m - m)@xmath12  = 5.60 ( r @xmath6 130 pc ) , and a@xmath8  = 0.06 ( c.f .",
    "pinsonneault 1998 ) , leading to m(i@xmath0 ) = 12.2 @xmath11  0.15 for the lithium depletion boundary , where we have assumed plausible but again unrigorous 1@xmath10  uncertainties of 0.1 mag for the distance modulus and 0.03 mag for the extinction and that the uncertainties add in quadrature .",
    "the age derived in this way is then 125 @xmath11  8 myr , where the uncertainty estimate only comes from propagating the 0.15 mag uncertainty of the boundary through the model shown in figure 3 .    in order to try to assess the model dependence of this estimate , we have also made a similar calculation for theoretical evolutionary models by burrows ( 1997 ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) .",
    "those models do not provide r and i magnitudes , so instead we have used the ( r - i)@xmath0 color to estimate an i@xmath0-band bolometric correction ( we adopted the monet ( 1992 ) bc@xmath8 vs. ( v - i)@xmath0  relation , and a conversion from ( v - i)@xmath0  to ( r - i)@xmath0  based on data in leggett 1992 ) . in that manner , we estimate that the lithium depletion boundary in the pleiades is at m(bol ) = 11.99 . comparing this number to the predictions of the two theoretical models , we get an age for the pleiades of 130 myr based on the dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) calculations and 125 myr for the burrows ( 1997 ) models .",
    "the most commonly quoted age for the pleiades is of order 70 - 80 myr ( patenaude 1978 ; mermilliod 1981 ) .",
    "however , models with a relatively large amount of convective core overshoot can yield much larger ages , as was originally shown by the models of the padova group ( c.f .",
    "mazzei & pigatto 1989 , who derived an age for the pleiades of 150 myr ) .",
    "other recent models give ages intermediate between these values ( e.g. 100 myr for meynet , mermilliod & maeder 1993 and @xmath13  120 myr for ventura 1998 ) . given the disagreement over the age derived from the upper main sequence turn - off , it is particularly useful to have an independent means to derive the age from low mass stars . using the lithium detection in ppl15 and the non - detection of lithium in hhj3 , bmg96 estimated the age of the pleiades to be 115 myr .",
    "our new result pushes this age even slightly older , but more importantly does so using many more stars and thus provides a much better defined age from the lithium data .",
    "finally , we note that we have chosen to use the  traditional \" distance scale to the pleiades ( r @xmath6  130 pc ) .",
    "that distance conflicts with the new hipparcos distance to the pleiades of about 116 pc ( van leeuwen & ruiz 1997 ; mermilliod 1997 ) .",
    "we have done this because we believe that the hipparcos distance for the pleiades is not correct , as has been discussed in pinsonneault ( 1998 ) and soderblom ( 1998 ) .",
    "the zeroth order effect of simply using the hipparcos distance and keeping everything else the same would lead to an even older pleiades age of about 140 myr .",
    "using the keck ii telescope , we have obtained good intermediate - resolution spectra of ten very low mass , probable members of the pleaides cluster .",
    "we detect lithium in seven of these stars , bringing the total number of confirmed lithium brown dwarfs in the pleiades to ten . by also having spectra of several slightly brighter pleiades members which do not show lithium , we have accurately determined the lithium depletion edge in the pleiades to be at m(i@xmath0 )  = 12.2 . using three different theoretical evolutionary models ,",
    "we derive a  lithium age \" for the pleiades of 125 - 130 myr .",
    "the age of the pleiades as derived from the upper main sequence turnoff is variously quoted as between @xmath675 myr and @xmath6150 myr . if our new age as derived from location of the lithium depletion boundary is correct , and if the pleiades is normal in some sense , our result suggests that the ages for many young open clusters should be shifted towards the old end of the scale , in approximate accord with the age - scale derived from the models of the padova group ( mazzei & pigatto 1988 ) or that of ventura ( 1998 ) .",
    "because the pleiades stars have been extensively studied , they have served as one of the cornerstones in defining how rotational velocities , lithium abundances , coronal activity , etc .",
    "evolve with time . for most of those studies , an age of 75 - 100",
    "myr has been adopted for the pleiades .",
    "shifting the age of the pleiades to 125 myr ( with or without shifting the ages of the other well - studied nearby clusters ) will require modifications to our view of how these various properties evolve with time .",
    "this in turn will then affect the theoretical models that have been developed to explain these observed trends .",
