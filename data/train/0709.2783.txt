    "advancing fronts in fluid systems involve the motion of a fluid - fluid interface , a surface that lives in a three - dimensional world , and which is often constrained by a solid boundary .",
    "a typical example is that of an interface moving in a channel@xcite .",
    "examples of advancing fronts in channels are imbibition , a process in which a wetting fluid invades the channel due to an uncompensated capillary pressure , and the viscous fingering process@xcite , where a low - viscosity(or high - density ) fluid penetrates a high - viscosity(or low - density ) one .",
    "the problem of viscous fingering in a channel has been widely studied in the framework of hele - shaw theory .",
    "a hele - shaw cell is the two - dimensional limiting case of a very thin channel , where the equations of motion are averaged over the channel thickness .",
    "this reduces the interface to a line , the _ leading interface _ , that lives in the plane of the cell . as a consequence",
    ", the approximation discards any effects arising from the full three - dimensional structure of the interface .    nonetheless , penetration in the gap of a hele - shaw cell is a fundamental three - dimensional effect that has important repercussions in the viscous fingering problem .",
    "as theoretical studies have pointed out@xcite , a thin film of viscous fluid left adhered to the cell plates as the front advances modifies the capillary pressure at the leading interface , thus altering the front morphology .",
    "this has been confirmed in experiments of steady viscous fingers@xcite , where the presence of a thin film led to fingers not predicted by the two - dimensional theory . in the following paper",
    ", we will address the role of the thin film in viscous fingers .",
    "a thin wetting film is not the only consequence of a three - dimensional interfacial structure . in the context of liquid films spreading over dry substrates@xcite , where a two - dimensional approximation is typically applied ,",
    "three - dimensional effects are also important .",
    "for instance , the stability of a spreading front depends on the wetting properties of the fluid . experimentally , it has been observed@xcite that a crossover from unstable to stable fronts occurs when the dynamic contact angle exceeds @xmath0 , a situation which renders the velocity field within the film three - dimensional",
    ".    the problem of a moving interface in a three - dimensional channel must take into account a dynamic contact line , the intersection point between the fluid - fluid interface and the channel walls . in classic fluid mechanics",
    ", a moving contact line violates the usual no - stick boundary condition , leading to a divergent viscous dissipation@xcite .",
    "hence , contact line dynamics must consider a regularizing mechanism of the viscous dissipation singularity .",
    "a slip velocity in the vicinity of a driven contact line arises naturally in diffuse interface models of binary fluids@xcite , regularizing the singularity .",
    "these models consist of the usual navier - stokes equations coupled to a convection - diffusion equation of an order parameter@xcite .",
    "diffuse interface effects enter the force balance equations in the shape of order parameter gradients that play the role of a young force . as a result",
    ", the contact line slips over the solid boundary@xcite .",
    "away from the contact line , order parameter gradients vanish and the stick boundary condition is recovered .",
    "the size of the diffusion region , @xmath1 , is then a measure of how strong slip is for a given system and is clearly an important parameter .",
    "this size was estimated by briant and yeomans@xcite , who characterize @xmath1 for the case of an interface subjected to shearing walls .",
    "they focused on the dependence of @xmath1(@xmath2 in their notation ) on the model parameters , finding a scaling relation that was verified numerically .",
    "important implications arising from a relatively large or small slip velocity compared to the leading interface velocity in forced fronts can be foreseen .",
    "whenever both velocities are comparable , the interface should maintain a meniscus shape .",
    "conversely , as the slip velocity becomes small compared to the channel velocity the interface shape should develop as a finger , leaving a thin film of fluid adhered to the walls of the channel .",
    "in this paper we study the penetration process across the channel thickness .",
    "we study the motion of the full three - dimensional interface between two viscous fluids when it is subjected to a gravitational body force .",
    "we treat the case of a strictly flat leading interface , focusing only in the details that pertain to the channel thickness .",
    "we work with symmetric fluids as well as with fluids of different densities or viscosities .",
    "we focus on two principal matters .",
    "we first describe how the contact line and leading interface velocities are related , and propose the mechanisms that determine the velocity ratio .",
    "we find that the velocity ratio is controlled by the force balance at the interface and by diffusion effects localized at the contact line .",
    "secondly , we study the thin film that forms inevitably in the case of small slip . in that case",
    "the front decouples from the contact line leading to the growth of a finger , even when the interface is linearly stable to the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "we find that the fraction of occupation of the thin film relative to the channel thickness is a function of the capillary number and the viscosity contrast between the fluids .",
    "the high viscosity contrast case is validated by comparing our results to the numerical work of halpern and gaver@xcite which is consistent with previous results of taylor@xcite . for fluids with zero viscosity contrast , it turns out that the finger width has much lower values than for the high viscosity contrast case at fixed capillary number .",
    "the morphology of our fingers is very much alike to the saffman - taylor finger shape , a prediction of the hele - shaw theory .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to stress that although the case of a flat leading interface is two - dimensional , the equations of motion are not equivalent to those of the saffman - taylor problem .",
    "therefore , penetration in the channel thickness can not be attributed to the saffman - taylor instability .",
    "likewise , the selection rule of the steady state , _",
    "i.e. _ , the actual dependence of the thin film thickness with the front velocity , can not be mapped to the theoretical predictions of the viscous fingering theory .",
    "we will address these matters by means of numerical simulations of the mesoscopic equations of the system .",
    "to do so , we take advantage of a powerful integration algorithm in fluid dynamics , the lattice - boltzmann scheme for binary fluids .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we have studied the forced motion of a fluid - fluid interface in a three - dimensional channel by means of a mesoscopic model that takes into account contact line dynamics .",
    "our results describe two possible scenarios regarding interface dynamics .",
    "a meniscus regime is found whenever the contact line velocity is comparable to the leading interface velocity .",
    "conversely , when the contact line velocity is smaller than the leading interface velocity the meniscus configuration is lost , leading to penetration of one fluid into the other in a fingering fashion . a thin film of displaced fluid",
    "is hence left adhered to the plates of the channel .",
    "the crossover from the meniscus to the thin film regime is controlled by the competition between surface and viscous stresses , as well as by the competition of diffusive and advective timescales , on top of the usual hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "these mechanisms can be accounted for through simple scaling arguments .",
    "we find a prediction for the crossover in terms of the capillary and pclet numbers which describes accurately our numerical results .",
    "menisci are found for low capillary and pclet numbers , when surface tension and diffusion dominate over viscous stresses and advection respectively .",
    "an example of a system where diffusion is important is that of colloid - polymer mixtures . for such systems ,",
    "the relatively large size of the interface together with low surface tensions leads to large diffusion regions near de contact line .",
    "for instance , in ref.@xcite the size of the interface is typically @xmath200 m while the surface tension is @xmath201n . for molecular liquids",
    "the size of the interface is of the order of nanometers , while @xmath202mn@xmath203 . as explained in sec.[sec : disc ] , the size of the diffusion region scales as @xmath204 , all other parameters kept constant . with these values",
    "the ratio of the diffusion length between colloid - polymer mixtures and molecular liquids is at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "thin films are obtained for high values of both parameters , when advection and viscous stresses are dominant .",
    "our prediction works for both symmetric and asymmetric fluids . from the crossover prediction",
    ", we propose that thin films can be assured as long as @xmath205 for symmetric fluids and @xmath206 for asymmetric fluids .",
    "anyhow , this values are consistent with the typical experimental regime .",
    "for instance , experiments of ref.@xcite were done in a channel of thickness @xmath207  m , with a silicone oil with @xmath208  cp , @xmath209  dyn / cm and @xmath210  @xmath211s@xcite .",
    "typical velocities in the experiments ranged from @xmath212  m / s to @xmath213  m / s . with these values ,",
    "we obtain @xmath214 , which is consistent with our prediction for the thin film regime .",
    "we have examined the steady state of the thin film regime .",
    "we have found , in agreement with ref.@xcite , that contact line dynamics does not affect the steady state finger shape .",
    "the capillary number and the viscosity contrast between the fluids determine the shape of the finger .    for a low - viscosity fluid pushing a high - viscosity one ,",
    "the finger narrows with increasing capillary number down to a limiting value of @xmath215 in units of the channel thickness .",
    "these results agree with the numerical results of ref.@xcite for the wide range of capillary numbers considered . due to computational limitations",
    "we do not investigate fingers with very low capillary numbers .",
    "nonetheless , as we recover results from ref.@xcite , we expect that the low capillary number limit can be recovered by our method as well .    for fluids with equal viscosities",
    "we have found a curve of the finger width as a function of the capillary number that does not follow any previous results . the width of the finger decreases with increasing capillary number , an expected observation , but to a remarkably limiting width of @xmath216 in units of the channel thickness .",
    "this contrasts with the saturation value of the asymmetric case .",
    "the steady state is independent of whether or not the interface is linearly unstable to the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "this reinforces the conjecture of the steady state being independent of the mechanism that first leads to penetration of one fluid to the other . for low capillary numbers the shape of our fingers is universal and is consistent with the finger shape of pitts , which suggests that the steady state can be described on simple mechanical equilibrium grounds .",
    "in a future work we will address the problem of viscous fingering allowing for a non - flat leading interface .",
    "as we have shown , the shape of the interface across the channel thickness can be controlled by tuning the diffusion strength in the contact line .",
    "hence , it is possible to describe situations in which the leading interface undergoes a fingering process both in the presence and absence of a thin film in the channel thickness direction . in the presence of a thin film , additional control over the interface shape",
    "can be gained by choosing between fluids of equal or different viscosities .",
    "these features are very convenient to study in detail the three - dimensional effects that arise in the viscous fingering problem .",

    "<S> the difference between the slip and channel velocities determines whether the interface advances as a meniscus or a thin film of fluid is left adhered to the plates . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this effect is controlled by the capillary and pclet numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the crossover from a meniscus to a thin film and find good agreement with numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> the penetration regime is examined in the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the occupation fraction of the advancing finger relative to the channel thickness is controlled by the capillary number and the viscosity contrast between the fluids . for high viscosity contrast </S>",
    "<S> , lattice - boltzmann results agree with previous results . for zero viscosity contrast </S>",
    "<S> , we observe remarkably narrow fingers . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the finger is found to be universal . </S>"
