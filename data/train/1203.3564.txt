    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) is the main tracking detector in the central barrel of the alice experiment @xcite at the cern lhc .",
    "it is a 90 m@xmath1 cylinder filled with gas and divided in two drift regions by the central electrode located at its axial center .",
    "a field cage creates a uniform electric field along each half of the chamber .",
    "charged particles traversing the tpc volume ionize the gas along their paths liberating electrons that drift toward the end plates of the chamber .",
    "the necessary signal amplification is provided through avalanche effects in the vicinity of the anode wires . moving from the anode wire toward the surrounding electrodes , the positive ions created in the avalanche",
    "induce a positive current signal which characterized by a fast rise time ( less than 1 ns ) and a long tail with a rather complex shape .",
    "it carries a charge that for the minimum ionizing particle that is in the order of 4.8  fc .",
    "the readout of the signal is done by the 557 568 pads that form the cathode plane of the conventional wire chambers located at the tpc end caps .",
    "the amplitude , which is different for the different pad sizes , has a typical value of 7  @xmath2a .",
    "the signal is delivered on the detector impedance which , to a very good approximation , is a pure capacitance of the order of 12  pf .",
    "the signals from the pads are passed to 4356 front - end cards , located about 10 cm away from the pad plane , via flexible kapton cables . in the front - end card the charge - sensitive shaping amplifier of the pasa circuit",
    "transforms the charge induced in the pads into a differential semi - gaussian signal that is fed to the input of the altro chip @xcite .",
    "this paper addresses the design of the pasa that is fabricated in a 0.35 micron cmos technology . in section [ sec : over ] , the used pasa architecture is presented .",
    "this architecture consists of several blocks that are described in sections [ sec : coramp ] , [ sec : shaper ] , [ sec : nonin ] , and [ sec : bias ] . in section  [ sec : layout ]",
    "the layout techniques are explained . in section  [ sec : simu ] , the performance of the chip at the simulation level is shown .",
    "the standalone test results of all produced chips and their performance in the final system are described in section  [ sec : meassys ] .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",

    "about 48000 chips , with a total of about 762 176 channels have been fabricated and fully tested .",
    "theoretical calculation , simulation and system measurements results show very good agreement with each other .",
    "the alice pasa production has successfully satisfied all specifications with good margin .",
    "in particular , the evaluation of the noise in the fully commissioned system shows an enc noise behavior of typically 0.71 adc - counts ( 710 electrons ) . this is close to optimum of what we can expect for such a complex system including both pasa , adc ( altro ) and other electronics placed in the vicinity of the alice tpc pasa .    a baseline shift and a small offset in power consumption",
    "is seen , due to manufacturing variations that will result in process and device parameter variations from lot - to - lot , wafer - to - wafer , die - to - die , and device - to - device .",
    "the extreme chip and system tests show a yield of about 98% .",
    "losses are mainly due to one channel being outside the acceptance region .",
    "this very high yield is the result of a robust design optimized using extensive simulations , including extracted parasitics from layout , for the recommended ams corners , and of the techniques used in the layout to reduce the effect of the process variations .",
    "the circuit was realized in ams s c35b3c1 0.35 um cmos process , has a area of 18 mm@xmath0 and the die is packed in a tqfp 144 package .",
    "the alice tpc pasa has been selected for the upgrade at star tpc ( 11500 chips ) , it also being used at mipp / fermilab ( 1100 chips ) and at bonus / jlab ( a few hundred chips ) .",
