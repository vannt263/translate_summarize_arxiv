    "privacy and security start being treated as important issues . traditionally , security in wireless communications has mainly been addressed in upper layers and focused on computational security such as cryptography .",
    "recently , information - theoretic security in physical layer has received great attentions because it enables perfect secrecy without the aid of encryption / decryption keys .    a typical model of a security communication system consists of three nodes  a transmitter ( alice ) , a legitimate receiver ( bob ) , and a passive eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "information theoretic security study was opened by shannon @xcite with the notion of perfect secrecy .",
    "the wiretap channel model was first introduced by wyner @xcite and _ secrecy capacity _ is defined in @xcite as the maximum achievable rate of bob preventing eve from obtaining any information .",
    "positive secrecy capacity was shown to be achieved when bob s channel is less noisy than eve s . for guaranteeing positive secrecy rate , artificial noise",
    "was additionally transmitted from the transmitter @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite showed that the artificial noise can enlarge the secrecy rate region in a symmetric interference channel .",
    "the secrecy issues were also studied in cooperative relay systems @xcite . in @xcite , joint selection of relays and jammers was studied and opportunistic jamming and relay chatting was proposed .    as an alternative measure to secrecy capacity ,",
    "secure degrees of freedom ( dof ) have popularly been investigated . in @xcite ,",
    "the secure dof was found in an x network . for @xmath4-user",
    "gaussian interference channels , an interference channel with confidential message and an interference channel with an external eavesdropper were studied in @xcite , respectively .",
    "the secure dofs for those cases were shown to be @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , while a half dof per orthogonal dimension is to be achievable via the _ interference alignment _",
    "( ia ) scheme @xcite in the absence of the secrecy constraint .",
    "the multiuser diversity , exploiting multiuser dimensions by serving the selected users with good channel conditions , can enhance the performance of wireless communication systems @xcite .",
    "in many cases , the multiuser diversity asymptotically achieves the optimal performance with considerably reduced channel feedback overhead .",
    "recently , the opportunistic interference alignment ( oia ) has been proposed by the authors in order to resolve the difficulties of ia implementation @xcite . in the oia scheme",
    ", user dimensions are exploited to align interfering channels ; each transmitter has multiple users and selects a single user having the most aligned interfering channels",
    ". the oia scheme does not require the global channel state information ( csi ) and large computational complexity for precoding / postprocessing design .",
    "a bit surprisingly , the achieved dof by oia was shown to be higher than that of conventional ia thanks to multiuser dimensions .",
    "this result motivates new applications using the concept of oia for security communication systems .    in this paper",
    ", we propose opportunistic jammer selection ( ojs ) schemes for secure dof .",
    "the basic idea of ojs is to align jamming signals at bob s receiver via jammer selection , while the jamming signals are not aligned at eve .",
    "there is a jammer group consisting of @xmath0 jammers , and bob selects @xmath7 jammers among them whose jamming signals are most aligned .",
    "since we use jamming subspaces formed by jammers , the selected jammers simply use independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) gaussian signals independent of eve s csi as well as alice s . denoting the numbers of antennas at alice , bob , and",

    "although the jamming signals from the selected jammers can be aligned at bob s receiver , they are randomly given to eve and hence span @xmath2-dimensional subspace at eve s receiver .",

    "] , we can regard @xmath2 as _ defensible dimensions _ of the system . for any number of eve s receive antennas",
    ", we can make eve s dof zero by increasing either the number of selected jammers @xmath1 or the number of each jammer s antennas @xmath3 . on the contrary ,",
    "the jamming signals from the selected jammers can be aligned in @xmath3-dimensional subspace at bob s receiver if the number of jammers goes to infinity . in this case",
    ", bob needs only @xmath13 receive antennas to obtain dof of @xmath8 while eve needs @xmath14 receive antennas .",
    "although both oia and ojs exploit multiuser ( or multiple jammer ) dimensions to align interfering ( or jamming ) signals , the problems are quite different .",
    "in oia , each user in @xmath4-transmitter ic has @xmath15 interfering channels jointly determined for each channel realization .",
    "thus , the oia problem is to measure how much the @xmath15 interfering channels are aligned at the selected user when each user has @xmath15 random interfering channels .",
    "however , because bob chooses @xmath1 jammers among total @xmath0 jammers in ojs , the problem is changed to how much we can align the @xmath1 jamming signals by directly picking each jamming signal among @xmath0 jamming signals .",
    "there have been many studies on utilizing jammers for increasing secure dof @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "cooperative jamming with structured jamming signals based on lattice coding was proposed for a gaussian wiretap channel . in multiple access fading channels , @xcite proposed two ergodic alignment schemes for secrecy communications  scaling based alignment ( sba ) and ergodic secret alignment ( esa ) . in sba , users repeatedly transmit their symbols with proper scaling over several consecutive time slots .",
    "then , the signals are aligned at eavesdropper s receiver and hence eve s dof becomes zero . in esa ,",
    "the concept of ergodic ia @xcite was extended to secrecy communications . in @xcite ,",
    "cooperative jammers were exploited to increase secure dof in a gaussian wiretap channel , where transmitter and cooperative jammers send jointly designed signals according to channel conditions .",
    "contrary to the previous works , in our proposed ojs schemes , the selected jammers adopt i.i.d gaussian signals oblivious to csi .",
    "furthermore , any precoding design at alice is not required for the proposed scheme .",
    "because the role of csi is only for constructing the wiretap code , the proposed ojs scheme does not suffer from secure dof degradation even with only bob s csi , which is a practical advantage of the proposed ojs scheme .",
    "our contributions are summarized below .    * using a geometrical interpretation of jamming signals , we define an _ alignment measure _ representing how well the selected jamming signals are aligned at bob s receiver and quantify the achievable alignment measure via jammer selection for the total number of jammers . * to obtain the secure dof , we propose two jammer selection schemes  the minimum dof loss jammer selection and the subspace - based jammer selection .",
    "using the proposed jammer selection schemes , we show that bob can achieve the secure dof of @xmath16 $ ] when the number of jammers is scaled by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is transmit power .",
    "* we show that the same secure dof is achievable with secrecy outage probability @xmath19 by the proposed ojs with only bob s csi .",

    "we assume that alice and the selected jammers fully utilize their antenna dimensions , i.e. , alice and each selected jammer transmit @xmath8 and @xmath3 streams , respectively .",
    "we also assume that eve has more antennas than each jammer , i.e. , @xmath21 , and bob selects @xmath1 jammers such that @xmath22 .",

    ", we firstly assume that alice knows bob s achievable rate and eve s channel capacity after bob s jammer selection .",
    "then , in section [ section : partial_csi ] we show that the required jammer scaling for the target secure dof is the same even in practical scenarios that alice has no information about eve .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the quasi - static fading channel model @xcite , where the coherent interval is longer than the jammer selection procedure and the length of a codeword .",
    "that is , the channel coefficients remain constant over the transmission of an entire codeword but each codeword suffers from an independent channel .    let @xmath26 be the indices of the @xmath1 selected jammers in the jammer group .",
    "then , the received signal of bob , @xmath27 , is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the channel matrix from alice to bob , and @xmath30 is the channel matrix from the @xmath31th jammer to bob .",
