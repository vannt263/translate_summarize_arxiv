    "for the past few years , the ads / cft duality@xcite-@xcite , which provides an exact correspondence between a gravity theory in ( d+1)-dimensional ads space to that with a strongly coupled gauge theory living on d - dimensions has been extensively applied in order to describe various phenomena in usual condensed matter physics including high @xmath1 superconductivity .",

    "besides the conventional framework of maxwell electrodynamics , there is always a provision for incorporating non - linear electrodynamics in various aspects of gravity theories .",
    "the theory of non - linear electrodynamics was originally introduced in an attempt to remove certain discrepancies , such as the infinite self energy of electrons , for the maxwell theory@xcite .",
    "recently gravity theories with non - linear electrodynamics have found profound applications due to its emergence in the low energy limit of the heterotic string theory@xcite-@xcite .",

    "several intriguing features regarding the properties of black holes , such as regular black hole solutions@xcite,@xcite , validation of the zeroth and the first law of black hole mechanics@xcite , different asymptotic behaviours of black hole solutions@xcite etc . , have been emerged .    among the various theories with non - linear electrodynamics ,",
    "it is the born - infeld ( bi ) theory that has attained renewed attentions due to its several remarkable features .",

    "the regular bi theory with finite energy gives the non - singular solutions of the field equations .",
    "in fact the bi electrodynamics is the only non - linear electrodynamic theory with a sensible weak field limit@xcite",

    "for the past couple of years gravity theories with both linear ( usual maxwell case ) as well as non - linear electrodynamics have been extensively studied in the context of ads / cft superconductivity@xcite-@xcite .",
    "surprisingly it is observed that lesser efforts have been paid while dealing with non - linear theories@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the analysis that have been performed so far are mostly based on numerical techniques .",

    "this boundary condition seems to be quite non - trivial as far as analytic computation is concerned .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the perturbative technique required to solve the differential equations does not work in a straightforward manner .",
    "however , we overcome this problem by adopting certain mathematical tricks and have successfully computed the onset of @xmath0-wave condensate . from our analysis",
    "we have been ( analytically ) able to show that the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) indeed gets affected due to the presence of higher derivative corrections to the usual maxwell action .",
    "in fact it is found to be decreasing with the increase in the value of the bi coupling parameter ( @xmath8 ) which suggests the onset of harder condensation .",
    "it is also noteworthy that our analytic results are in good agreement with the existing numerical results@xcite .",

    "in which nonlinear born - infeld lagrangian is included in the matter action .",

    "on top of it , our approach reveals the fact that the solutions of the field equations are highly nontrivial and are not even exactly solvable . the analytic method presented here provides a smooth platform to deal with this difficulty .",

    "the results thus obtained from our calculations can be summarized qualitatively as follow :    @xmath130 the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) increases as we decrease the value of @xmath8 indicating the onset of a harder condensation ( table 1 ) .",
    "@xmath130 the value of the order parameter increases with the increase of @xmath8 ( table 2 ) .",
    "the point that must be stressed at this stage of discussion is that the analytic approach is always more preferable than the numerical approach .",
    "this is due to the fact that the numerical results become less reliable when the temperature @xmath131 approaches to zero@xcite . in this temperature limit the numerical solutions to the nonlinear field equations",
    "becomes very much difficult and therefore the determination of the nature of the condensate becomes practically very arduous unless analytic methods are taken into account .",
    "therefore , analytic method is always more reliable while performing computations as @xmath132 .",

    "contrary to the numerical approach , in the analytic method we have taken into account only the leading order terms in the coupling @xmath8 .",
    "certainly , there is a great amount of approximation involved which is absent in the numerical technique .",
    "the difference between the two approaches in fact motivates us to enquire into a more general analytic approach in which the above disparity may be reduced and the agreement eventually becomes more close .",
    "apart from this there are other possibilities which we must emphasize in order to obtain enriched physics from the theoretical point of view .",
    "these may be stated as follows :    \\(i ) it would be very much interesting to repeat the above analysis in the presence of back reaction .",

    "<S> in this paper , considering the probe limit , we analytically study the onset of holographic @xmath0-wave condensate in the planar schwarzschild - ads background . inspired by various low energy features of string theory , in the present work we replace the conventional maxwell action by a ( non - linear ) born - infeld ( bi ) action which essentially corresponds to the higher derivative corrections of the gauge fields . based on a variational method , which is commonly known as the sturm - liouville ( sl ) eigenvalue problem and considering a non - trivial asymptotic solution for the scalar field , we compute the critical temperature for the @xmath0-wave condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the results thus obtained analytically agree well with the numerical findings@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as a next step , we extend our perturbative technique to compute the order parameter for the condensation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly our analytic results are found to be of the same order as the numerical values obtained earlier . </S>"
