    "the question as to whether there are traversable wormholes in the universe is at present among the most important problems of classical relativity .",
    "the reason is that in the course of its evolution a spacetime with such a wormhole is apt to develop the cauchy horizon @xcite . at one time",
    "it was believed that closed timelike curves must lurk beyond the horizon and it was commonplace to tie existence of wormholes with possibility of time machines .",
    "later it has become clear that the two phenomena are not directly connected  the spacetime _",
    "always _ can be extended through the cauchy horizon in infinitely many ways , all these extensions being equal ( since _ none _ of them is globally hyperbolic ) , and _",
    "always _ some of them are causal @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fact remains that having a wormhole one can ( try to ) force the spacetime to choose between a number of continuations and we have no idea as to the criteria of the choice .",
    "that is the existence of traversable wormholes would possibly imply the existence of an unknown classical ( though non - local ! ) law governing the evolution of the universe .",
    "the process of emergence of the classical spacetime from what precedes it is not clear yet ( to say the least ) .",
    "so , it is well possible that the whole problem is spurious and there are no traversable wormholes just because they have never appeared in the first place . in principle",
    ", one can speculate that there is a mechanism suppressing formation of any topological ` irregularity ' at the onset of the classical universe .",
    "however , at present nothing suggests the existence of such a mechanism and it seems reasonable to pose the question : assuming a wormhole did appear in the end of the planck era , what would happen with it ?",
    "would it last for long enough to threaten global hyperbolicity ?    traditionally in searching for traversable wormholes",
    "one picks a stationary ( and hence traversable ) wormhole and looks for matter that could support it .",
    "however , in none of the hitherto examined wormholes the required matter looks too realistic . in some cases",
    "it is phantom matter with a prescribed equation of state @xcite , in some others  classical scalar field @xcite .",
    "true , two wormholes are known @xcite the matter content of which is less exotic in that it at least obeys the weak energy condition ( all necessary @xcite violations of the latter being provided by the vacuum polarization ) . however , the first of them has the throat @xmath0 wide and therefore , being nominally a wormhole , can scarcely be called traversable .",
    "the second is macroscopic ( arbitrarily large , in fact ) , but needs some classical matter .",
    "though this matter does satisfy the weak energy condition ( wec ) , nothing at the moment is known about how realistic it is in other respects . in this paper",
    "i take a different approach : first , i fix the initial form and the matter content of the wormhole trying to choose them as simple as possible ( the hope is that the simpler is the model the better are the chances that it reflects general properties of the real wormholes ) .",
    "then i subject it to the ( semiclassical ) einstein equations @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is the expectation value of the quantum stress - energy tensor and @xmath3 is the contribution of the classical matter ) and trace the evolution of this presumably realistic wormhole testing it for traversability .",
    "the wormhole under consideration  i shall denote it @xmath4   comes into being in the end of the planck era as the schwarzschild space with mass @xmath5 ( to be more precise , as a three - dimensional subspace @xmath6thereof ) , hence the name einstein  rosen wormhole .",
    "the form of @xmath6  is defined by trans - planckian physics that gives birth to the wormhole .",
    "i set three conditions on @xmath6 , of which only one seems to lead to noticeable loss in generality .",
    "each of the allowed @xmath6  is characterized by three numbers  @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . for a given mass @xmath9",
    "is related to the minimal possible radius of @xmath6  and , when @xmath9 is fixed , @xmath10 loosely speaking measures the delay between the end of the planck era near the throat and in the remote parts of the right ( left ) asymptotically flat region ( i mostly consider an ` inter - universe wormhole ' @xcite , i.  e.  a spacetime with two asymptotically flat regions connected by a throat ; an ` intra - universe wormhole ' is constructed in section  [ sec : conc ] by identifying parts of these regions , correspondingly a new parameter @xmath11  the distance between the mouths  appears ) .",
    "the wormhole is taken to be empty : @xmath12 ( for reasons of simplicity again ) .",
    "hence , classically it would be just ( a part of ) the schwarzschild space @xmath13 , which is a standard of non - traversability @xcite .",
    "but the schwarzschild black hole , as is well known , evaporates , that is quantum effects in @xmath13 give rise to a non - zero vacuum stress - energy tensor @xmath14 .",
    "so , by the einstein equations @xmath4  is anything but @xmath13 .",
    "determination of its real geometry is , in fact , a longstanding problem , see e.  g.  @xcite for references and @xcite for some discussion on its possible relation to the wormholes . in this paper",
    "i make no attempts to solve it .",
    "it turns out that to study traversability of a wormhole all one needs to know is the metric in the immediate vicinity of the apparent horizons and , fortunately , for wormholes with the proper values of @xmath9 this  simpler  problem can be solved separately .    to that end",
    "i make a few assumptions based on the idea that quantum effects are relatively weak .",
    "roughly , i assume that the system ( einstein equations + quantum field equations ) has a solution @xmath4  with the geometry resembling that of the schwarzschild space  and coinciding with the latter on @xmath6   and with @xmath2 close to that of the conformal scalar field in the unruh vacuum ( what exactly the words ` resembling ' and ` close ' mean in this context is specified in section  [ sec : we ] ) .",
    "though the above - mentioned assumptions are quite usual and on the face of it seem rather innocent , in _ some _ situations , as we shall see , they can not be true ( which on the second thought is not surprising  one does not expect the vacuum polarization to be weak near the singularity , or in the throat at the moment of its maximal expansion ) .",
    "therefore the consideration will be restricted to the class of wormholes with  @xmath15 .    throughout the paper",
    "the planck units are used : @xmath16 and the mass @xmath5 is supposed to be large in these units .",
    "we begin with recapitulating some facts about the schwarzschild space , which will be needed later .",
    "the eternal ( though non - static ) spherically symmetric empty wormhole is described by the schwarzschild metric , which we shall write in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and the function @xmath19 is defined implicitly by the equation @xmath20 it is easy to check that the following relations hold    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    in the unruh vacuum the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor of the conformal scalar field has the following structure : @xmath25 ( all remaining components of @xmath26 are zero due to the spherical symmetry ) , where @xmath27 are functions of @xmath28 , but not of @xmath29 , or @xmath30 separately . what is known about @xmath31 supports the idea that in the planck units they are small .",
    "in particular , @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined in is @xmath34 as follows from the results of @xcite and @xcite , see appendix  [ app:1 ] . at the horizons @xmath35 , which in this case are the surfaces @xmath36 ,    [ eq : tonschor_s ] @xmath37{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\ , \\raisebox{-.55em}{$\\displaystyle{}_{\\mathring{h}}$ }   } =   \\frac{\\tau_1(1)}{4\\pi}=   -\\frac{\\mathring{f}^4(1)k}{16m_0 ^4 } ,   \\qquad k\\equiv - \\frac{\\tau_1(1)e^2}{64\\pi } , \\ ] ] @xmath38{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\ , \\raisebox{-.55em}{$\\displaystyle{}_{\\mathring{h}}$ }   } =    \\frac{\\tau_2 ( 1)}{4 \\pi m_0 ^ 4 } , \\ ] ] and @xmath39{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\ , \\raisebox{-.55em}{$\\displaystyle{}_{\\mathring{h}}$ }   } =   \\frac{\\tau_3(1)}{4\\pi m_0 ^ 2}\\ll   \\frac{\\mathring{f}^2}{64\\pi m_0 ^2 } .\\ ] ]      the wormhole @xmath4  being discussed is a spacetime with the metric @xmath40 to express the idea that the wormhole is ` initially schwarzschildian ' we require that there should be a surface @xmath6     the section @xmath41 of the einstein  rosen wormhole .",
    "the thin solid lines are surfaces @xmath42 .",
    "the gray angle is the event horizon.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    such that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and their first derivatives are equal , on @xmath6 , to @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and their derivatives , respectively .",
    "the surface is subject to the following three requirements :    it is spacelike between the horizons , i.  e. at[sv : sp ] @xmath47 ;    for the points of @xmath6  with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the dependence @xmath50 is a smooth positive function without maximums .",
    "the same must hold also with @xmath51 and @xmath52 interchanged;[sv : vic ]    far from the wormhole ( i.  e. at @xmath53 ) @xmath6  must be just a surface of constant schwarzschild time , that is it must be given by the equation @xmath54.[sv : far ] thus ( see figure  [ fig : kartinka ] ) for any point @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xmath57    condition restricts substantially the class of wormholes under examination , in contrast to , which is of minor importance and can be easily weakened , if desired .",
    "the idea behind is that far from the wormhole the schwarzschild time becomes the ` usual ' time and that the planck era ended  by that usual time  simultaneously in different regions of the universe .",
    "though , remarkably , does not affect the relevant geometrical properties of @xmath4 , it proves to be very useful in their interpretation .",
    "in particular , it enables us to assign in an intuitive way the ` time ' @xmath58 to any event @xmath59 near the throat of the wormhole .",
    "namely , @xmath59 happens at the moment when it is reached by the photon emitted in the end of planck era from the point @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) located in the left ( respectively , right ) asymptotically flat region .",
    "the distance from this point to the wormhole  when it is large enough  is approximately @xmath62 ( respectively , @xmath63 ) .",
    "taking this distance to be the measure of the elapsed time from the end of the planck era we define @xmath64 ( even though @xmath65 is null , as is with ` advanced ' and ` retarded ' time in the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "note that as long as we consider the two asymptotically flat regions as different and totally independent ( i.  e.up to section  [ sec : conc ] ) there is no relation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , nor there is a preferred value for either of them .",
    "among other things the choice of @xmath6  fixes the coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath51 up to a transformation @xmath66 to fix this remaining arbitrariness and thus to make formulas more compact we require [ p : calibr ] @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the coordinates of the intersections of @xmath6with the coordinate axes , see figure  [ fig : kartinka ] . though no reasons are seen to think that wormholes with some particular values of @xmath70 are more common than with any other , we restrict our consideration to those with @xmath71 as we shall see below the wormholes with smaller @xmath9 may be non - traversable , while those with larger @xmath9 evaporate too intensely and can not be studied within our simple model . to summarize",
    ", we have four independent parameters @xmath5 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , all values of which are considered equally possible as long as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "our subject will be the ( right , for definiteness ) horizon , by which i understand the curve @xmath75 lying in the @xmath76-plane and defined by the condition @xmath77{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\",

    "the horizon starts .",
    "@xmath75 can not return to @xmath6 , because there are no more points @xmath81 on @xmath6  [ by condition  ] .",
    "neither can it have an end point , being a level line of the function with non - zero [ by condition   imposed below ] gradient .",
    "so , @xmath75 goes from @xmath6  to infinity dividing the plane @xmath76 above @xmath6   into two parts : @xmath78 is strictly negative to the left of @xmath75 and strictly positive to the right .",
    "so the horizon exists and is unique .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath82 is that its each small segment shows where the event horizon would pass if the evolution ` stopped at this moment ' .",
    "the metric in that case would be just the schwarzschild",
    "metric with mass @xmath83 the fact that @xmath75 can be parametrized by @xmath51 , as is implied in this expression , will become obvious below .",
    "alternatively the horizon can be parametrized by @xmath84 .",
    "[ [ notation . ] ] notation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + +    from now on we shall write @xmath85 for the restriction of a function @xmath86 to @xmath75 . in doing",
    "so we view @xmath85 as a function of @xmath51 or @xmath84 depending on which parameterization is chosen for @xmath82  ( this is a  slight  abuse of notation , because strictly speaking @xmath87 and @xmath88 are different functions , but no confusion must arise ) .",
    "partial derivatives are , of course , understood to act on @xmath89 , not on @xmath85 .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath90 in conformity with this notation the function @xmath91 whose graph is @xmath75 will be denoted by @xmath92 , while @xmath93 is a shorthand notation for @xmath94 .",
    "traversability of the wormhole is determined by the fact that @xmath95 tends to @xmath96 as @xmath97 ( what happens at smaller @xmath84 is , of course , beyond the scope of this paper ) .",
    "indeed , consider a null geodesic @xmath98 given by @xmath99 , where @xmath100",
    ". in our model @xmath101 is strictly positive [ see eq .   below ] and hence @xmath98 intersects @xmath75 once only .",
    "as we have just discussed @xmath78 is negative in all points of @xmath98 preceding @xmath59 and is positive afterwards .",
    "so , @xmath44 reaches in @xmath59 its minimum on @xmath98 .",
    "that is the photon emitted in @xmath102 passes in @xmath59 the throat of the wormhole is orthogonal to the sphere @xmath103 through @xmath59 , this term is in agreement with what is proposed in @xcite . ] and _ escapes to infinity_. as we move from @xmath60 to the left the same reasoning applies to all photons as long as their @xmath52-coordinates are small enough to enforce the intersection of @xmath75 and @xmath98 .",
    "the boundary of this region is generated by the points @xmath104 with @xmath105 ( as we shall see the supremum is provided , in fact , by @xmath106 ) .",
    "correspondingly , we define the _ closure time _",
    " the moment when the wormhole ceases to be traversable for a traveler wishing to get from the left asymptotically flat region to the other one : @xmath107 similarly is defined the _ opening time _ @xmath108 .",
    "so , the time of traversability of a wormhole is @xmath109 thus the goal of the paper is essentially to estimate @xmath110 .",
    "_    the fact that @xmath111 for all points of @xmath98 , guarantees that within our model no photon from the singularity @xmath112 will come out of the wormhole .",
    "so , in spite of evaporation and the wec violations involved , the wormhole fits in with the ( weak ) cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "the physical assumption lying in the heart of the whole analysis is the  evaporation stability \" of the einstein ",
    "rosen wormhole , i.  e.  i assume that there is a solution of the system ( einstein equations + field equations ) which starts from @xmath6  and has the following property : the geometry in a small neighbourhood of any point @xmath60 is similar to that in a point @xmath113 of the schwarzschild space with mass @xmath114 ( of course @xmath113 and @xmath114 depend on @xmath60 ) , while the stress - energy tensor in @xmath60 is small and close to @xmath115 .",
    "more specifically i require of @xmath4  that to the future of @xmath6    @xmath116    [ cf .  ] and @xmath117    the latter means that at @xmath6  the throat of the wormhole is already contracting and that later contraction does not pass into expansion .    the requirement that @xmath118 in a point @xmath119 is close to @xmath120 is embodied in the assumption that the relations are valid when the sign @xmath121 is removed and @xmath5 is replaced with @xmath84 : @xmath122 i also assume that outside the horizon @xmath123 in the schwarzschild case this inequality is known to hold at @xmath124 , see  .",
    "elster s results ( @xmath125 in notation of @xcite ) make it obvious that holds also at @xmath126 .",
    "it is still possible , of course , that @xmath127 by whatever reasons changes its sign somewhere between 1 and 1.5 , however , even if breaks down the results established below are not affected unless the violation is so strong that it changes the sign of the relevant _ integral _ , see .",
    "finally , i assume that @xmath128 again , the corresponding inequality in the schwarzschild case  it is @xmath129 , see and  holds both on the horizon and at large @xmath28 , see eqs .   and . and",
    ", again , we actually do not need to be true _",
    "pointwise_. the smallness of the relevant integral [ see eq .",
    "] would suffice .",
    "_ remark . _",
    "all these assumptions are local in the sense that to check their validity an observer in a point @xmath60 does not need to know anything beyond a small vicinity of @xmath60 .",
    "for , the requirement that the metric in this vicinity is ( approximately ) fixes the coordinates up to the transformation and the assumptions are invariant under that transformation .      now that the model is built finding out whether the einstein ",
    "rosen wormhole is traversable becomes a matter of mathematics .",
    "but traversability of wormholes , let alone the evolution of the black hole horizons , are long being investigated and both theories have arguments that seem to enable one to answer in the negative even without solving any equations . in this subsection",
    "i point the holes in two of these conceivable arguments .      from it",
    "is seen that the weak energy condition is violated in some _ macroscopic _ region @xmath130 around the throat of the wormhole . at the same time",
    "the energy density @xmath131 measured by a free falling observer  whose proper time we denote by @xmath132  obeys in @xmath130 the inequality @xcite @xmath133 the combination of these two properties in a few occasions ( note that the global structure of the spacetime is irrelevant here , it need not be a wormhole ) led to quite impressive estimates .",
    "thus , in particular , it was found in @xcite that in the alcubierre bubble and in the krasnikov tube there are three - surfaces @xmath134 and unit timelike vector fields @xmath135 such that @xmath136 the figure in the right hand side is so huge that both spacetimes were dismissed as ` unphysical ' .",
    "so , is there not any danger of that kind in our case ?",
    "the answer is negative by at least two reasons .",
    "first , we explore not the capabilities of a hypothetical advanced civilization ( as is usual in discussing the above - mentioned spacetimes ) , but a natural phenomenon .",
    "and there is a vital interpretational difference between these two situations .",
    "indeed , in the former case the fact that a physical quantity has a presumably unrealistic value can be used as a ground for ruling the corresponding solution out as unphysical or unfeasible .",
    "but in the case at hand the situation  once the assumptions about the initial data , the values of the parameters , and the other constituents of the model are admitted reasonable  is _",
    "reverse_. if calculations yield , this would not signify that the spacetime is unphysical . on the contrary ,",
    "it would mean that huge values of the integral may occur in physically appropriate situations and thus can not serve as sign of unfeasibility of a spacetime .",
    "second , the estimates like do not follow from automatically .",
    "additional assumptions are necessary and the approximate equality @xmath137 is among them @xcite . at first glance ,",
    "violation of this equality would signify some unnatural fine - tuning ( note that @xmath138 can be understood quite liberally , the difference in 510 orders being immaterial ) .",
    "in fact , however , this is not the case : eq",
    ".   corresponds to the situation in which the geometry of @xmath130 is defined mostly by its ( exotic ) matter content , while the contribution to the curvature of the weyl tensor is neglected .",
    "but in four dimensions this is not always possible .",
    "for example , eq .   breaks down , in _ any _ non - flat empty region ( the numerator vanishes there but the denominator does not ) . and the einstein ",
    "rosen wormhole is just another example .",
    "loosely speaking , the schwarzschild spacetime is a wormhole by itself . in making it traversable exotic matter",
    "is needed not to shape the spacetime into a wormhole , but only to keep the latter ajar .",
    "the model built above is not entirely new .",
    "the behaviour of the apparent horizon in very similar assumptions was studied back in 1980s ( see , i.  e.  @xcite for some review ) .",
    "the spacetime under consideration , though , was not the wormhole @xmath4 , but the black hole originating from gravitational collapse ( such a spacetime is not a wormhole , nor is it empty ) .",
    "the general consensus ( see though @xcite ) was that the backreaction results only in the shift of the event horizon to a radius smaller than @xmath139 by @xmath140 , which is physically negligible  @xcite .",
    "to see why such an overwhelmingly small @xmath141 does not make wormholes non - traversable note that @xmath141 is the shift in radius and _ not the distance _ between the horizons in the minkowski plane.[f - n ] is it far from , or close to the origin of coordinates ?",
    "the answer is : neither .",
    "simply by an appropriate coordinate transformation one can give _ any _ value to @xmath141 . ] .",
    "that is @xmath142 , see figure  [ fig : kartinka ] .",
    "clearly this quantity has nothing to do with traversability of the wormhole .",
    "the einstein equations for the metric read @xmath143 on the horizon the left hand side in can be neglected by , while @xmath78 vanishes there by definition and we have @xmath144 eqs .   and give @xmath145 likewise , and result in @xmath146 finally , equations and yield @xmath147      our aim in this subsection is to find the function @xmath93 .",

    "the relations between the three parameterizations are given by the obvious formulas : @xmath152 and @xmath153 of which the former follows right from the definitions , and the latter from the fact that @xmath154 on @xmath75 .",
    "these formulas enable us to write down @xmath155 using and the relation @xmath156 which follows from eqs .   and , one can rewrite as @xmath157 to assess the first term in the right hand side consider the segment @xmath98 of the null geodesic @xmath158 between a pair of points @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",

    "for the wormholes in discussion it is only @xmath255 , which is of the order of minutes even for giant black holes which presumably can be found in the centers of galaxies . and",

    "the resulting spacetime , see figure  [ fig : intra ] , is the minkowski space in which the interiors of two cylinders ( their boundaries are @xmath277 and @xmath278 ) are replaced by a connected region , so that , for example , a photon intersecting @xmath277 at a moment @xmath279 emerges from @xmath278 at some @xmath280 .",

    "so , if @xmath282 is taken to be sufficiently large the inequality breaks down . which means that",
    "irrespective of the values of @xmath5 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and @xmath286 , the intra - universe einstein  rosen wormholes with sufficiently large @xmath287 are time machines .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the spherically symmetric empty wormhole , or to put it otherwise the backreaction of the hawking radiation on the ( approximately ) schwarzschild metric .",
    "a few simplifying assumptions were made , which physically reduced to the idea that the metric and the vacuum polarization around each observer remain approximately those of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "it turns out that such a wormhole is characterized by three parameters in addition to the initial mass and the distance between the mouths .",
    "the explicit calculations within this model have shown that _ for a macroscopic time interval  _ its duration is determined by those parameters _",
    " the wormhole is traversable_.    none of the assumptions made in this paper looks too wild , so its results can be regarded as evidence for possibility of natural ` transient ' wormholes .",
    "obviously the existence of such wormholes would be of enormous significance , the implications ranging from a process generating highly collimated flashes to causality violation ( or at least violation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture ) .",
