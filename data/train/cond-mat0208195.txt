    "the intersubband absorption linewidth in semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) closely relates to fundamental problems in the physics of optical transition , such as relaxation @xcite , many - body effects @xcite , and disorder @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is a key factor in improving the performance of quantum cascade lasers @xcite and qw infrared photodetectors @xcite .    to investigate the effects of various scattering processes ,",
    "intersubband absorption linewidths have been measured for various temperatures @xcite ,",
    "well widths @xcite , alloy compositions @xcite , and doping positions @xcite in gaas and other qws .",
    "these results show that absorption linewidth has a weak dependence on temperature and alloy composition and apparently has little correlation with mobility .",
    "its strong well - width dependence suggests that the main contribution is from interface roughness scattering .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we discussed the effect of interface roughness scattering on linewidth by comparing calculations based on a microscopic theory by ando @xcite and experimental data for modulation - doped gaas / alas qws with a well width of @xmath5 .",
    "the results made it clear that linewidth is much more sensitive to interface roughness scattering than transport mobility is , because the contribution from the intrasubband scattering in the first excited subband is much larger than that in the ground subband @xcite . even in wide gaas qws , where interface roughness scattering should be less effective",
    ", recent reports @xcite showed that interface roughness scattering has a larger effect on linewidth than either electron - electron scattering or bulk impurity scattering .",
    "in the present paper , we apply our theoretical method @xcite to scattering by lo phonons , la phonons , alloy disorder , and ionized impurities as well as interface roughness scattering , in order to compare their respective contributions to intersubband absorption linewidth and transport mobility .",
    "numerical calculations for gaas qws confirm that the very high sensitivity of linewidth to interface roughness scattering is the key to quantitatively explaining the previously reported experimental results for linewidth in comparison with mobility .    the method presented here follows ando s theory @xcite , in which the intrasubband and intersubband energy - dependent single - particle @xcite relaxation rates for various scattering mechanisms are first calculated and then included in a formula for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dynamical conductivity @xmath6 to give the absorption lineshape for photon frequency @xmath7 .",
    "this method is similar to a familiar method of calculating transport mobility @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that intersubband optical absorption is the collective excitation among a confined electron gas .",
    "however , our present calculation of single - particle relaxation rates and lineshape is very important and useful , because the absorption lineshape @xmath8 of collective excitation is given by the single - particle dynamical conductivity @xmath9 via @xcite @xmath10 in the crudest approximation .",
    "here , @xmath11 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath12 is the static dielectric constant of the 2d material , and @xmath13 is the effective thickness of the 2d electron gas @xcite .",
    "the collective excitation effects , or many - body interaction effects , on intersubband absorption linewidth have been issues of recent interest in both theoretical and experimental studies . in the limit of small band - nonparabolicity and constant single - particle relaxation rates , nikonov _ et al .",
    "_ theoretically showed that many - body effects only cause blue - shifts in absorption spectra ( the depolarization shift ) and that the linewidth is solely determined by the single - particle relaxation rate @xcite .    in largely nonparabolic systems ,",
    "the variation in energy separation between the ground and first excited subbands produces additional width in the single - particle excitation lineshape @xmath6 . however , many - body effects lead to redistribution of oscillator strength and collective excitation that has a sharp resonance . as a result ,",
    "the linewidth of the collective excitation spectrum @xmath8 is significantly different from that of the single - particle excitation spectrum @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nonparabolicity causes difficulties in calculating single - particle relaxation rates and @xmath6 by ando s formalism @xcite .",
    "experiments to elucidate these effects were performed by warburton _",
    "on inas / alsb qws @xcite .    in the more popular systems of gaas",
    "/ algaas and ingaas / inalas qws , however , our present calculation , which assumes small nonparabolicity , is applicable .",
    "the purposes of this paper are ( 1 ) to calculate intrasubband and intersubband single - particle relaxation rates for relevant scattering mechanisms as functions of in - plane kinetic energy assuming small nonparabolicity and ( 2 ) to quantitatively explain previously reported experimental data on linewidth and mobility in gaas - based qws , which appeared to have little correlation .    in the next section ,",
    "we summarize how linewidth and mobility are related to single - particle relaxation rates , and calculate the single - particle relaxation rates for various scattering mechanisms as functions of the kinetic energy @xmath14 .",
    "it is shown that linewidth and mobility have very different sensitivities to the same scattering mechanism . in section 3 , previously reported experimental data for various temperatures , well widths , alloy compositions , and doping positions are quantitatively explained by numerical calculations .",
