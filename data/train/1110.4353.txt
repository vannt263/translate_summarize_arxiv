    "the 4.5  absolute magnitude of wd  0806 - 661  b suggests that it could be the faintest and coolest known brown dwarf ( @xmath6  k ) .",
    "in addition to potentially breaking new ground in terms of temperature , this companion could be one of a small number of benchmark brown dwarfs whose ages are known via their primaries and thus can provide unusually stringent tests of theoretical models of substellar objects .",
    "however , the temperature of wd  0806 - 661  b is uncertain since it has been detected at only 4.5  .    to confirm its substellar nature and better",

    "april 18 , irac collected one 93.6  s exposure of wd  0806 - 661  b through the 3.6  filter at each position in a 12-point dither pattern .",
    "these observations were conducted through astronomical observation request 41905408 for program 70203 .",
    "the spitzer science center pipeline ( version s18.18.0 ) performed the initial processing of the individual 3.6  images .",
    "we then combined these images into one mosaic using the overlap and mosaic pipelines within the mosaicking and point - source extraction software package ( mopex , * ? ? ?",
    "we used mopex rather than the software applied to the 4.5  data by @xcite since it offers drizzling and point response function ( prf ) subtraction , which are beneficial for our analysis of wd  0806 - 661  b , as described below .",
    "we re - reduced the two sets of 4.5  images with mopex as well .",
    "a plate scale of @xmath11  pixel@xmath8 was selected for the final mosaics . to optimize the accuracy of the relative astrometry between the three mosaics , we measured new world coordinate systems ( wcss ) for the first and third epochs of data based on the second epoch mosaic in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "the reduced irac images surrounding the position of wd  0806 - 661  b are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",

    "is partially blended with another source at a distance of @xmath12 that is similar in brightness , which is presumably a background star or galaxy .",
    "the use of drizzling within mopex has optimized the spatial resolution of the final mosaic , making it slightly easier to resolve wd  0806 - 661  b from this source . through the apex pipeline within mopex",

    "we have now attempted to subtract the contribution from this source in this 4.5  image in the same manner as done at 3.6  .",
    "the aperture for photometry of wd  0806 - 661  b in the first epoch at 4.5  does not encompass the location of the background source .",
    "we measured aperture photometry for wd  0806 - 661  b in each of the three mosaics with an aperture radius of 4 pixels ( @xmath13 ) and radii of 5 and 10 pixels for the inner and outer boundaries of the sky annulus , respectively . to estimate aperture corrections , we measured photometry for all sources in a given mosaic with these parameters and with those used by @xcite , computed the average offset between the two sets of photometry , and combined this offset with the aperture corrections measured by @xcite .",
    "we present the resulting photometry at 3.6 and 4.5  in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "our new measurements at 4.5  is fainter than the value we reported in @xcite because of the subtraction of the blended background source from the second epoch data .",
    "in addition to the 3.6  data from irac , we have pursued near - ir photometry to further constrain the temperature of wd  0806 - 661  b and to assess the feasibility of spectroscopy . we have focused on filters near 1.2 - 1.3  ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) for these observations since they offer the best sensitivity at near - ir wavelengths for cool brown dwarfs .",
    "our first set of near - ir images was obtained with the high acuity wide - field k - band imager ( hawk - i ) on the unit telescope 4 of the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",

    ", we subtracted a dark frame and divided by a flat field image .",
    "the resulting images were registered and combined into a single mosaic . to measure the wcs and flux calibration for the mosaic , we began by reducing archival @xmath0-band images of this field that are publicly available from the infrared side port imager at the 4  m blanco telescope @xcite .",
    "we used astrometry and photometry from the point source catalog of the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to measure the flux calibration and wcs of the ispi mosaic , which is large enough ( @xmath16 ) to encompass a sufficient number of 2mass sources .",
    "we then used ispi astrometry and photometry to determine the wcs and flux calibration of the hawk - i data .",
    "point sources in the hawk - i mosaic exhibit fwhm@xmath17 . to facilitate visual detection of sources with low signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) in figure  [ fig : image ] , we have smoothed the image to a resolution of @xmath18 .",

    "we used a medium - band filter ( denoted as @xmath21 ) that extends from 1.221.35  rather than a standard @xmath0-band filter ( 1.131.35  ) since it is aligned more closely with the wavelengths at which the near - ir fluxes of t dwarfs are highest . during the nights of 2011 april 17 and 18 , we placed wd  0806 - 661  b in one of the four arrays of fourstar and collected 46 dithered images , each of which consisted of three coadded 32  s exposures .",
    "the resulting total exposure time was 73.6  min .",
    "the fourstar images were reduced with procedures similar to those applied to the hawk - i data .",
    "we derived the flux calibration of the final mosaic from images of two photometric standards , gd71 and gd173 , and synthetic @xmath22 vega - based colors derived from the transmission profiles for these filters . to verify this calibration",
    ", we also calibrated the mosaic using the ispi photometry as done for hawk - i .",
    "the ispi sources that appear within the fourstar data have a mean color of @xmath23 .",
    "using a spectrum of vega , we estimate that an a0v star reddened to have this color will have @xmath24 . when we combined this color with the ispi @xmath0-band photometry for sources detected by fourstar , we arrived at the same flux calibration as derived from the photometric standards .",
    "the average fwhm for point sources in the fourstar mosaic is @xmath25 . as with the hawk - i data",
    ", we have smoothed the fourstar image to a resolution of @xmath18 for display in figure  [ fig : image ] , and it does not show a detection of wd  0806 - 661  b. we estimate that snr=3 corresponds to a vega - based magnitude of @xmath26 in this image . by combining the observed spectra of late t dwarfs with the transmission profiles for @xmath0 and @xmath21 , we derive colors of @xmath27 .",
    "when we use the model spectra of brown dwarfs from @xcite and @xcite , we arrive at similar values of @xmath22 for temperatures above 250  k. thus , the limit of @xmath28 implies that wd  0806 - 661  b has @xmath29 , which is the same as the limit measured with hawk - i .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have previously reported @xmath0-band limits for wd  0806 - 661  b. @xcite measured a limit of @xmath30 for snr@xmath33 , which they described as 1.7  mag fainter than the one from @xcite .",
    "however , the two limits were not compared at the same snr .",
    "given that the limit of @xmath31 from @xcite corresponded to snr@xmath3210 , the @xmath0-band constraint from @xcite was 0.4  mag deeper than that from @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified wd  0806 - 661  b as a companion based on its common proper motion with the primary between the first two epochs of irac images . given our new detection of wd  0806 - 661  b at 3.6",
    ", we can verify that wd  0806 - 661  b shares the same proper motion as the primary . in figure",
    "[ fig : pm ] , we show the differences in equatorial coordinates between the 3.6  image and the first 4.5  image for stars detected in both images . to estimate the uncertainty in the displacement of the secondary",
    ", one would normally examine the scatter in figure  [ fig : pm ] for sources near its magnitude .",
    "however , because wd  0806 - 661  b is very red in @xmath1-[4.5]$ ] , few sources in the irac images match its brightness at both wavelengths . as an alternative means of estimating the uncertainties ,",
    "we have computed the standard deviations of the differences in right ascension and declination for objects that have a similar combination of snrs , except in the opposite bands compared to wd  0806 - 661  b. in other words , whereas wd  0806 - 661  b has a low snr at 3.6  and a high snr in 4.5  , we have considered sources that have low and high snrs at 4.5 and 3.6  , respectively .",
    "many sources of this kind are available because the 3.6  images are deeper than the 4.5  data . in this way , we estimate a 1  @xmath33 uncertainty of @xmath34 in each of the offsets in right ascension and declination .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : pm ] , the motion of wd  0806 - 661  b based on our new astrometry is non - zero at a level of 8  @xmath33 in each direction and is consistent within @xmath35  @xmath33 of that of the primary .",
    "wd  0806 - 661  b was detected only at 4.5  in previous images .",
    "as a result , only limits were available for its colors , such as @xmath2 $ ] , which strongly suggested a cool temperature @xcite .",
    "our detection at 3.6  now provides a direct measurement of a color for wd  0806 - 661  b. we find that it has @xmath1-[4.5]=2.77\\pm0.16 $ ] , which is much redder than the neutral colors exhibited by most astronomical sources and confirms that it is a cool , methane - bearing object @xcite .    to investigate how wd  0806 - 661  b compares to previously known brown dwarfs in terms of temperature and luminosity , we begin by constructing diagrams of @xmath36 versus @xmath1-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath36 versus @xmath2 $ ] in figure  [ fig : cmd ] for wd  0806 - 661  b and all known t and y dwarfs that have measured distances and irac photometry ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "sources that have been observed in both systems are plotted twice . when multiple @xmath0-band measurements are available for a given object , we have adopted the mean of those data weighted by the inverse square of their flux errors . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] , wd  0806 - 661  b is redder and fainter than all of the t dwarfs in this sample .",
    "it is also redder than the one y dwarf with a measured parallax , wisep j154151.65 - 225025.2 ( hereafter wisep j1541 - 2250 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but that object appears to be fainter than wd  0806 - 661  b. as a result , a single sequence of t and y dwarfs would not be pass through the locations of both wd  0806 - 661  b and wisep j1541 - 2250 in the color - magnitude diagrams , unless the former is an unresolved binary .",
    "this discrepancy may arise from the large uncertainty in the parallax of wisep j1541 - 2250 .",
    "we note that the very cool brown dwarf companion cfbdsir j1458 + 1013  b is absent from figure  [ fig : cmd ] since it lacks mid - ir photometry .",
    "it is @xmath37 times brighter than wd  0806 - 661  b in @xmath38 , and hence should be significantly warmer ( table  [ tab : data ] , * ? ? ?",
    "since _ wise _ has also measured mid - ir data for a large number of brown dwarfs , we have included in figure  [ fig : cmd ] color - magnitude diagrams based on the _ wise _ bands at 3.4 and 4.6  ( denoted as @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",

    "we can use our new photometry for wd  0806 - 661  b to update our previous estimates of its mass and effective temperature from @xcite . to derive the mass of wd  0806 - 661  b ,",
    "@xcite compared @xmath36 to the predictions of evolutionary models for the age of the primary . in that study ,",
    "our age estimate was in part based on an analytic relation between initial stellar mass and evolutionary time through the end of core helium burning @xcite .",
    "we now revise our previous calculation to use the evolutionary time predicted by the numerical models from @xcite , which results in a new estimate of @xmath42  gyr for the total age of the white dwarf .",
    "when we compare our new measurement of @xmath36 to the values predicted by @xcite and @xcite for this age , we arrive at a mass of 69  @xmath43 for wd  0806 - 661  b.    both the colors and absolute magnitudes of cool brown dwarfs are sensitive to their temperatures .",
    "to assess which of these measurements for wd  0806 - 661  b is most likely to produce a reliable temperature estimate , we have plotted theoretical colors and magnitudes of brown dwarfs in figure  [ fig : cmd ] for ages of 1 and 3  gyr .",
    "we have considered the cloudy models from @xcite , which employ equilibrium chemistry , and new versions of the cloudless models from @xcite for both equilibrium and non - equilibrium chemistry .",

    "the quoted uncertainties represent only the error in @xmath36 and do not include the unknown systematic errors in the model predictions .",
    "we now examine the temperature of wd  0806 - 661  b in the context of one of the faintest known brown dwarfs , cfbdsir j1458 + 1013  b. @xcite considered two methods for estimating the temperature of this object . in the first one ,",

    "@xmath2 $ ] that is observed at lower temperatures ( figure  [ fig : cc ] ) also indicates that bc@xmath55 is unlikely to remain constant . as a result , the bolometric luminosity of cfbdsir j1458 + 1013  b",
    "was probably underestimated , which would explain why the luminosity - based temperature was lower than the value derived from @xmath38 .",
    "through deep imaging at @xmath0 and 3.6  , we have further demonstrated the companionship of wd  0806 - 661  b via its common proper motion with its primary and have provided new constraints on its photometric properties .",
    "we have found that wd  0806 - 661  b is redder than at least five of the six y dwarfs recently discovered by @xcite , indicating that it is probably a member of this new spectral class as well .",
    "wd  0806 - 661  b and the y dwarf wisep j1828 + 2650 appear to be the coldest known brown dwarfs based on their @xmath1-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath2 $ ] colors . a @xmath0-band detection of wd  0806 - 661  b and a parallax measurement for wisep j1828 + 2650 are needed to determine their relative temperatures .",
    "more accurate photometry at 3.6  for the former and at @xmath0 for the latter also would help refine the comparison of these objects .",
    "in addition to representing one of the coldest known objects directly observed outside the solar system , wd  0806 - 661  b is a benchmark for testing atmospheric and evolutionary models at substellar masses since its age and distance are well - constrained via its primary . to fully exploit it for this purpose , deeper imaging at @xmath0 and other bands",
    "is necessary .",
    "wd  0806 - 661  b is too faint for ground - based spectroscopy , but near - ir grism observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ may be feasible .",
    "the new y dwarfs found with _",
    "wise _ have closer distances and are much more amenable to detailed spectroscopic study @xcite , but even low - snr spectroscopy of wd  0806 - 661  b would be valuable given its extreme temperature and benchmark status .    because of the rapid decrease in the @xmath0-band fluxes of brown dwarfs at the lowest temperatures , it seems unlikely that objects cooler than wd  0806 - 661  b will be found with wide - field ground - based imaging , which is restricted to near - ir wavelengths .",
    "for instance , current ground - based surveys have identified t dwarfs down to @xmath57 @xcite , corresponding to a distance limit of @xmath32.5  pc for analogs of wd  0806 - 661  b. the discovery of any additional objects with @xmath58  k over the next decade will probably occur through continued analysis of mid - ir data from the _ wise _ and _ spitzer _ satellites .",
    "for instance , typical mid - ir images from _ wise _ are capable of detecting objects like wd  0806 - 661  b with snr=10 out to distances of @xmath59  pc .",
