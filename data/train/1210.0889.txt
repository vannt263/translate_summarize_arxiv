    "gradients also frequently arise in the spatial distribution of biological populations because the environmental conditions may change gradually in space ( e.g.  from lower to higher elevation along a hillside ) .",

    "the hull has been used in practice , for example , in studies of the surface structure of polymers  @xcite , of the treeline dividing woodland from grassland  @xcite , of the boundary of urban settlements  @xcite and as an example of a non - trapping self - avoiding random walk whose properties have been investigated theoretically  @xcite and with computer simulations  @xcite .",
