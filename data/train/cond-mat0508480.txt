    "lithium - orthophosphates li_m_po@xmath0 ( _ m _ = mn , fe , co , ni ) have attracted a renewed interest in recent years , both for their relatively high lithium ionic - conductivity that can potentially be applied in rechargeable battery technology @xcite , and for their intriguing magnetic properties , in particular , the strong magneto - electric ( me ) effect they exhibit @xcite . in this regard , of particular importance",
    "is lifepo@xmath0 , as it has already been tested as a high - potential cathode in secondary li - ion rechargeable battery @xcite . like other members of the lithium - orthophosphates",
    ", lifepo@xmath0 is an insulator adopting the _ pnma _ space group @xcite . in this structure ,",
    "the fe@xmath2 ion occupies the center of a slightly distorted _",
    "m_o@xmath6 octahedron that shares oxygen anions with a po@xmath0 tetrahedron forming a closely packed oxygen framework .",
    "the fe@xmath2 ions ( s = 2 ) form corrugated layers that are stacked along the [ 100 ] crystallographic axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ str](a ) .",
    "nearest neighbors in the _ b - c _ plane are coupled magnetically by a relatively strong exchange interaction , @xmath7 through an fe - o - fe oxygen - bond , whereas in - plane next - nearest - neighbors are coupled ( @xmath8 ) via fe - o - o - fe @xcite ( see fig .",

    "interlayer magnetic coupling is mediated by a phosphate ion via an fe - o - p - o - fe bonding @xcite .",
    "thus , the olivine family of li_m_po@xmath0 exhibits highly anisotropic properties which are between those of two- ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of li_m_po@xmath0 systems have been studied since the early 1960s @xcite .",
    "they all undergo an antiferromagnetic transition at low temperatures to a similar magnetic arrangement differing only in the orientation of the staggered spins .",
    "nearest- neighbor ( nn ) spins in the _ b - c _ plane are anti - parallel and the stacking along the @xmath9-axis is such that ferromagnetic sheets perpendicular to the @xmath10-axis are formed ; nearest neighbor sheets are anti - parallel giving rise to ( 010 ) fundamental magnetic reflection that , depending on the direction of the magnetic moment , can be intense or extinct .",
    "earlier neutron diffraction studies of polycrystalline samples showed that the magnetic space group of lifepo@xmath0 and licopo@xmath0 is _ pnma_ with the spins oriented along _ b _ crystallographic direction ( i.e. , the ( 010 ) reflection is absent ) , and _ pnm_@xmath11 magnetic space group for linipo@xmath0 and limnpo@xmath0 with the spins aligned parallel to the @xmath12-axis ( i.e. , strong intensity at the ( 010 ) reflection ) @xcite .",

    "j_@xmath5 = -0.92 mev @xcite .",
    "however , so far there has been no experimental determination of the exchange coupling among fe@xmath2 spins and of the single - ion anisotropy in lifepo@xmath0 , for comparison with the theoretical predictions .",
    "knowledge of exchange couplings and single - ion - anisotropy is also important for understanding the origin of the strong magneto - electric ( me ) effect in lifepo4 @xcite .",

    "detailed determination of the magnetic structure using neutron diffraction from single crystals can shed light on the origin of these anomalies .    herein , we report measurements of spin - wave dispersion curves of single crystal lifepo@xmath0 by inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "spin wave dispersion curves can provide the values of exchange interactions and the single ion anisotropy .",
    "the measured dispersion curves were modeled using linear spin wave theory by including the in - plane nearest - neighbors ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbors ( nnn ) spin couplings the inter - plane nearest - neighbor spin coupling and the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "we have also employed single - crystal elastic neutron diffraction techniques to investigate whether there are subtle deviations from the previously reported magnetic structure determined from neutron diffraction measurements of polycrystalline samples .",
    "lifepo@xmath0 single crystals were grown by standard flux growth technique ( licl was used as the flux ) from a stoichiometric mixture of high purity fecl@xmath4 ( 99.999@xmath19 aldrich ) and li@xmath20po@xmath0 ( 99.999@xmath19 aldrich ) @xcite . the grown single crystals have a dark greenish color . the composition and structure",
    "were confirmed by carrying out rietveld analysis of the x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) data , using the gsas software package @xcite .",
    "no extra peaks from impurities were detected in the xrd pattern .",

    "the lattice parameters yielded from the refinement ( @xmath21  , @xmath22  , and @xmath23  ) are in good agreement with literature values @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering measurements were carried out on the hb1a triple axis spectrometer at high flux isotope reactor at oak ridge national laboratory . a monochromatic neutron beam of wavelength @xmath24 = 2.366   ( 14.6125 mev , @xmath25@xmath26 ) was selected by a double monochromator system , using the ( 0 0 2 ) bragg reflection of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) crystals .",
    "hopg crystal was also used as analyzer for both the elastic and the inelastic studies . the @xmath24/2 component in the beam",
    "was removed by two hopg filters located before and after the second monochromator .",
    "the collimating configuration 40@xmath27- 40@xmath27 - sample - 34 @xmath28- 68 @xmath27 was used throughout the experiments .",
    "temperature measurements and control were achieved by a conducts ltc-20 using lake shore silicon - diode temperature sensors . an irregular shaped single crystal ( weight @xmath29 0.4 g ) was folded in aluminum foil and mounted on a thin aluminum post .",
    "it was then sealed in an aluminum can under helium atmosphere and loaded onto the tip of a closed - cycle helium refrigerator ( displex ) .",
    "two temperature sensors were mounted on the cold - tip of the displex and on the sample can .",
    "the temperature was controlled using the cold - tip sensor .",
    "the temperature difference between the two sensors was about 0.2 k over the temperature range investigated .",
    "the lifepo@xmath0 crystal was oriented such that the _ a - b _ plane coincided with the horizontal scattering plane of the spectrometer .",
    "the elastic measurements confirmed that the magnetic structure of lifepo@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic with the main direction of the moment oriented along the _ b_-axis .",
    "however , contrary to the previous neutron diffraction experiments performed on powder samples , we have detected the presence of the ( 0 1 0 ) reflection .",
    "the intensity of this peak is relatively weak but its intensity follows a similar temperature dependence as that of a stronger magnetic peak ( 210 ) ( see fig .  [ order ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the ( 0 1 0 ) peak is forbidden by the symmetry of the _ pnma_@xmath30 magnetic space group previously proposed to describe the spin arrangement in lifepo@xmath0 @xcite . in the _ pmna _ crystal symmetry ,",
    "the point group of the fe 4_c _ site is _ m_@xmath31 and the only allowable magnetic point groups are , therefore , _",

    "the magnetic contribution to the ( 010 ) peak indicates that the ordered moment is not strictly oriented along the @xmath10-axis and a small component perpendicular to this axis is present .",
    "this implies a lowering of the symmetry of the magnetic space group where both magnetic components ( along and perpendicular to @xmath10-axis ) are allowed . from the intensity ratio of the two reflections _",

    "the ratio between the magnetic and nuclear contributions to the peak intensities of reflections ( _ i_@xmath39/_i_@xmath40 ) can be used to determine the average magnetic moment , @xmath41 from @xmath42 where for the reflection in question , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the nuclear and magnetic structure factors , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the nuclear and magnetic intensities and @xmath47 is the magnetic form factor of fe@xmath2 at momentum transfer @xmath48 .",

    "using the peak intensities of ( 210 ) at 300 k and 10 k to calculate the @xmath46 and @xmath45 , and using @xmath50 = 0.85 , the calculated average magnetic moment @xmath41 for fe is 3.93 @xmath51 0.05 @xmath52 , which is very close to the values of 3.99 @xmath52 and 3.8 @xmath52 obtained in refs . @xcite and @xcite .    to determine the temperature dependence of the order parameter",

    "the transition temperature is very close to the values reported in the literature 50 @xmath38 2 k @xcite .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath56 is slightly smaller than that calculated for the 3d ising model ( @xmath56= 0.32 ) @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependent background - like scattering above _ t_@xmath13 and below @xmath29 60 k indicates some kind of critical scattering due to short - range order formation or due to a dimensionality cross - over .",
    "the spin wave excitations were measured at 10 k along the ( @xmath57 , 1 , 0 ) and ( 0 , 1+@xmath57 , 0 ) reciprocal space directions , for energy transfers ( energy loss mode ) ranging from 1 to 8.5 mev . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ inelastic ] ( a , b , c ) , well defined dispersive magnetic - modes of resolution - limited energy - width were observed at all wave vectors . a typical constant - q scan , performed at the zone center ( 010 ) ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ inelastic ] ( a ) , indicating a single excitation at an energy transfer of 5.86 @xmath38 0.04 mev .",
    "the increase in intensity at energy transfer below approximately 1 mev is due to the quasielastic scattering from the newly observed ( 0 1 0 ) magnetic bragg peak . above the transition temperature ( @xmath49 = 50 k ) , at approximately 55 k , the inelastic peak at 5.86 mev disappears , confirming its magnetic origin .",
    "such an energy gap in the dispersion curve is usually driven by single ion anisotropy . a similar energy gap of 2 mev at 2 k , was also observed in the linipo@xmath0 , and it was found to decrease with increasing the temperature @xcite . in the case of lifepo@xmath0 , measurements performed at different temperatures indicate that the energy gap is temperature independent .",

    "the data were fitted to gaussian functions ( solid line in fig . [ inelastic ] ( a , b , c ) ) where the background was assumed to be constant .",
    "the spin - wave dispersion branches deduced from these fits , for both _ b_@xmath58 and _ a_@xmath58 reciprocal - space directions , are plotted in figure [ dispersion ] .",
    "it is shown that the dispersion curves montonically increase in energy with @xmath57 , and that the spin - waves propagating in the plane along the ( 010 ) direction have higher frequencies than those propagating transversally along the ( 100 ) .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior reflects the anisotropy in the strength of exchange couplings in the system ; as expected the in - plane exchange couplings are much stronger than those between planes .",
    "to construct a hamiltonian for the spin system , we recall that in limpo@xmath0 olivine family the in - plane super - exchange or super - super exchange interactions between nearest and next - nearest neighboring fe@xmath2 ions ( _ j_@xmath3 and _ j_@xmath4 ) are expected to be much stronger than that between the nearest inter - plane neighbors ( _ j_@xmath5 ) @xcite . therefore , we propose the following hamiltonian , @xmath59 where , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the in - plane nn and nnn coupling constants , respectively , and @xmath60 is the inter - plane nn coupling constant .",
    "the illustrations of _ j_@xmath3 , _ j_@xmath4 and @xmath60 are shown in figure[str](b ) .",
    "_ d _ is the single - ion anisotropy constant quantifying the tendency of the spins to align along the easy axis ( the @xmath61 component is defined to be along the direction of the moment at the ground state - _ b _ * ) .",
    "the ising like ground state of the system is believed to be invoked by the single - ion anisotropy term which comes about from crystal field effects and spin - orbit coupling @xcite . using the antiferromagnetic spin - wave theory@xcite , the lattice with _",
    "n _ sites was divided into two sublattices a and b , where nearest - neighbors of an fe@xmath2 site in one sub - lattice are all sites in the other sublattice . the next - nearest neighbors of an fe@xmath2 site are in the same sublattice .",
    "the magnon dispersion curves were calculated using the holstein - primakoff spin operator transformation to linear approximation ( i.e. , linear spin - wave theory @xcite ) .",

    "it should be noted that single - ion anisotropy was not considered in the theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have measured spin - wave dispersions and determined spin exchange couplings in lifepo@xmath0 .",
    "our results show that although there are competing interactions between nn and nnn spins in lifepo@xmath0 , they do not lead to more complicated , incommensurate or non - colinear , magnetic structures .",
    "this is in contrast to the observation of incommensurate magnetic phases in linipo@xmath0@xcite .",
    "these competing interactions may explain the observation of weak - ferromagnetism in li@xmath76po@xmath0 systems@xcite .",
