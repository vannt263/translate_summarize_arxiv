    "in today s wireless communication systems , the demand for higher data rates and wide - range coverage is steadily growing . to meet these requirements ,",
    "a high density of base stations is necessary , which entails high costs for installation and maintenance .",
    "another possibility to increase throughput and coverage is the use of relay nodes , which have much lower costs .",
    "relay channels were considered in @xcite first , and have drawn more and more research attention in the last decades .",
    "depending on how the signals are processed at the relay , different types of relaying schemes are distinguished .",
    "the most common ones are amplify - and - forward ( af , also called non - regenerative relaying ) and decode - and - forward ( df , also called regenerative relaying ) . while in af , the relay simply amplifies the received signals subject to a power constraint , a complete decoding and re - encoding of the signal is necessary when using df . as this yields higher costs and larger delays , we will restrict ourselves to af relaying schemes in this paper .",
    "in addition to relays , the deployment of nodes with multiple antennas helps to further increase the achievable data rates . the optimal combination of these two paradigms is an enormous challenge and has been considered in numerous publications , such as @xcite and the references therein . in",
    "@xcite an optimal amplifying matrix for a mimo relay is found for the case where the transmit covariance matrices of the transmitting node is a scaled identity matrix .",
    "the general case with arbitrary transmit covariance matrices is considered in @xcite , where the optimal structure of both relaying and transmit covariance matrix is found .",
    "however , this structure still contains parameters that are subject to optimization and the optimal solution of this problem remains unknown .",
    "if multi - user systems are considered , finding the optimal transmit covariance and relaying matrices becomes even more complex .",
    "achievable sum - rates for broadcast- @xcite and multiple - access channels ( mac ) @xcite with relays have been derived , but the optimal rates have not been found yet .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a @xmath0-user mac with a full - duplex af - relay , where all nodes except the receiver have multiple antennas . for this system ,",
    "we first find the optimal solution for the approach adopted in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we will introduce a different transmission scheme based on time - division multiple - access ( tdma ) , that decomposes the @xmath0-user multiple - access relay channel ( marc ) in @xmath0 orthogonal single - transmitter relay channels .",
    "thus , the relay only receives the signal of one transmit station at a time , while , in the transmission scheme from @xcite , the relay receives all transmit signals jointly . comparing the two schemes , we will show that the tdma - based transmit scheme achieves sum - rates that are always larger or equal than those achieved by joint relaying of the signals in the considered channel .",
    "this work is structured as follows : in section [ sec : problem_formulation ] , we introduce the channel model and describe the constraints that have to be fulfilled while optimizing the sum - rate .",
    "subsequently , we review a previous solution of this problem in section [ sec : joint_relaying ] and optimize it for the model considered here . a different approach , based on tdma , is proposed in section [ sec : tdma ] . after optimizing the parameters of the tdma - based solution ,",
    "its superiority is established .",
    "subsequently , section [ sec : simres ] provides a quantitative comparison between the solutions by means of simulation results .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we denote all column vectors in bold lower case and matrices in bold upper case letters . the trace and the hermitian of a matrix @xmath1",
    "are identified by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath4 to denote the euclidean norm of a vector @xmath5 and @xmath6 to describe the identity matrix .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicate the largest eigenvalue of a matrix @xmath1 and its corresponding eigenvector .",
    "a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the marc that we consider is depicted in figure [ fig : marc ] and consists of @xmath0 transmitting nodes .",
    "user @xmath11 has @xmath12 antennas , transmits the signal @xmath13 to the relay , and has a channel matrix of @xmath14 for this transmission .",
    "thus , the signal @xmath15 received at the relay can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the additive white gaussian noise at the relay and @xmath18 denotes the number of antennas at the relay .",
    "the relay amplifies the signals by the matrix @xmath19 and transmits the signal @xmath20 over the channel @xmath21 to the receiver . for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed that the relay receives and transmits at the same time ( full - duplex ) and in the same frequency band and that the direct paths between transmitters and receivers can be neglected .",
    "hence , the received signal can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the gaussian noise at the receiver .",
    "both the transmitters and the relay are subject to average power constraints .",
    "we use @xmath24 to denote the transmit covariance matrix of transmitter @xmath25 . with this definition",
    "the transmit power constraints are given by @xmath26 finally , we assume that perfect channel state information is available at all nodes .",
    "in @xcite a transmission scheme was presented , where all transmitters send simultaneously and the relay amplifies and forwards the sum of all those signals .",
    "therefore , we will refer to this scheme as `` joint relaying '' in the remainder of this paper .",
    "this scheme is briefly introduced in subsection [ subsec : previous ] . in the following subsections ,",
    "we first find the optimal relaying matrix @xmath19 ( [ subsec : opt_f ] ) and then derive the optimal covariance matrices @xmath27 ( [ subsec : opt_q ] ) .",
    "the achievable sum - rate of the scheme from @xcite is given as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and it can be optimized with respect to @xmath30 . considering @xmath31 as a matrix of size @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of receive antennas , its singular value decomposition ( svd ) can be defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 with descending diagonal order .",
    "moreover , we define the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 with descending diagonal order .    as stated in @xcite and shown in @xcite , the optimum structure of @xmath19 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for any @xmath27 , we can reformulate ( [ eq : powerconstr ] ) and ( [ eq : rs ] ) with the expressions from above to obtain the following optimization problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath42 however , for the setup considered here , we have only @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as only @xmath46 contributes to the sum - rate , the problem is obviously solved by @xmath47 , @xmath48 for this case .",
    "hence , the sum - rate can be expressed as @xmath49 and can now be optimized with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "as it can be seen from the last line of ( [ eq : rs_nontdma ] ) , the optimal sum - rate is achieved by maximizing the largest eigenvalue of @xmath36 . as the maximum eigenvalue operation is a convex function ,",
    "the maximization is not trivial . to provide a solution",
    ", we will introduce two lemmas :    [ lem : ev_pd ] let @xmath50 be positive semidefinite matrices . then , if @xmath51 is positive semidefinite ( @xmath52 ) , we have @xmath53    the proof is given in appendix a.    [ lem : pee_pi ]",
    "let @xmath54 be a positive semidefinite matrix with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then , it holds that @xmath57    the proof is given in appendix b.    with these two lemmas , we can now formulate :    the optimal value of the non - convex optimization problem @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "define @xmath60 . using lemmas [ lem : ev_pd ] and [ lem : pee_pi ]",
    ", it is directly seen that @xmath61 . for showing the achievability of this solution ,",
    "let @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "apparently , @xmath64 is satisfied and we can write @xmath65 where ( [ eq : vrv ] ) follows from the rayleigh quotient and ( [ eq : lmaxrt ] ) is obtained by using ( [ eq : qk_opt ] ) and writing @xmath66 and @xmath67 inside the sum .",
    "thus , choosing @xmath68 as in ( [ eq : qk_opt ] ) leads to the optimal value @xmath69 .    with this optimal choice of the covariance matrices the achievable sum - rate for joint relaying",
    "can be expressed as @xmath70",
    "in this section , we will introduce a relaying scheme based on tdma .",
    "this scheme includes a division of the transmission in @xmath0 time slots , where user @xmath25 occupies the @xmath25-th time slot exclusively .",
    "also the relay incorporates this slot structure , i.e. , the relaying matrix @xmath71 in time slot @xmath25 can be adapted to the channel of user @xmath25 only .",
    "thus , the tdma slot structure decomposes the channel in @xmath0 independent single user relay channels .",
    "therefore , we will first derive the optimal structure of the transmit covariance- and relaying matrix for the single user relay channel in subsection [ subsec : single_relay ] . in the following subsection [ subsec : transmission ]",
    ", we will transfer this scheme to the marc with tdma and optimize the achievable sum - rate .",
    "finally , in subsection [ subsec : evaluation ] we will show that this sum - rate is always larger or equal than the one in ( [ eq : rs_jr_opt ] ) .      in order to describe a single - user relay channel with a consistent notation",
    ", we assume the same channel model as introduced in subsection [ subsec : channel_mod ] and assume there is only @xmath72 transmitting user .",
    "for this scenario , it was shown in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) , that the optimal structure of the source covariance matrix @xmath73 and the relay matrix @xmath74 are given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the svd of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .    with these expressions , the achievable ( sum ) rate @xmath81 of the only user",
    "can be derived by evaluating ( [ eq : rs ] ) , which , together with the power constraints ( [ eq : powerconstr ] ) allows the formulation of an optimization problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .    in the case of @xmath43",
    "receive antenna considered here , the problem is even simpler to solve . as in the joint relaying scheme , we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the optimal choice of @xmath74 is again obtained by choosing @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "also for the transmit covariance matrix , only @xmath86 has a contribution to the rate , which makes @xmath87 , @xmath88 the optimal solution . using this solution ,",
    "the achievable rate @xmath81 can be written as @xmath89      in order to decompose the @xmath0-user marc in @xmath0 single - user relay channels , we use a tdma scheme , such that user @xmath25 transmits only in a time slot of duration @xmath90 with @xmath91 . in each time slot , the optimal choice of the relay matrix @xmath71 and the transmit covariance matrix @xmath68 can be obtained as in subsection [ subsec : single_relay ] .",
    "the only difference is the transmit power constraint : as user @xmath25 only transmits in @xmath90 fraction of the time , it can use a transmit power of @xmath92 and still fulfills the average transmit power constraint ( [ eq : powerconstr ] ) . thus , the rate of user @xmath25 is given by @xmath93\\!,\\ ] ] and the sum - rate can be calculated as @xmath94 .",
    "this sum - rate can be optimized by the choice of @xmath95 , where the optimum is given as follows :    [ theo : optimal_gk ] for the considered tdma transmission scheme in the @xmath0-user marc , the optimal durations of the time slots @xmath95 are given by @xmath96    consider the optimization problem @xmath97 where we introduced the vector @xmath98 $ ] and wrote @xmath99 as a function of @xmath100 to be more consistent with the notation used in optimization theory .",
    "first , it is easy to show that the above problem is convex and thus the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions provide necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality . for the underlying problem ,",
    "the kkt conditions of a solution @xmath101 to be optimal can be formulated as @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "if we choose @xmath101 as suggested in theorem [ theo : optimal_gk ] , the first condition is obviously fulfilled . for the second condition we can calculate the derivatives of @xmath99 and @xmath105 at the point @xmath106 as @xmath107 & \\hspace{-1.5cm}-\\frac{\\log_2(e)s{\\ensuremath{\\lvert { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{h}}}\\rvert}}^2p_r(1+{\\ensuremath{\\lvert { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{h}}}\\rvert}}^2\\pr)}{(s(1\\!+\\!{\\ensuremath{\\lvert { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{h}}}\\rvert}}^2p_r)\\!+\\!1)^2\\left(1+\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\lvert { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{h}}}\\rvert}}^2p_r}{(s(1+{\\ensuremath{\\lvert { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{h}}}\\rvert}}^2p_r)+1 ) } \\right)}\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial{\\ensuremath{\\tau^{(k)}}}}\\right|_{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}}={\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\ast } } } } & = -1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 . as the derivatives with respect to @xmath90 are the same in all components @xmath109",
    ", we can select @xmath110 and also the second kkt condition is fulfilled .    using this optimal time slot durations ,",
    "the achievable sum - rate of the tdma - based transmission scheme is given by @xmath111      the comparison between the proposed tdma - based and the previously considered joint relaying scheme is given by the following theorem :    [ theo : tdma_better ] in the considered @xmath0-user marc , the tdma - based transmission scheme with optimal time slot durations @xmath90 achieves at least the same sum - rate as the joint relaying scheme , i.e. , @xmath112    comparing the rate expressions of @xmath99 and @xmath113 from ( [ eq : rstdma ] ) and ( [ eq : rs_jr_opt ] ) , respectively , it can be seen that it is sufficient to show that @xmath114 .",
    "this is easily obtained by writing @xmath115 where ( [ eq : lmax_r ] ) follows from the convexity of the maximum eigenvalue operation .",
    "note that ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in ( [ eq : lmax_r ] ) equality holds only if all eigenvalues @xmath116 have the same eigenvector .",
    "however , if the matrices @xmath117 are statistically independent , which is a valid assumption in practical systems , this happens with probability zero .",
    "the consequence of this is that the tdma - based approach is strictly better .",
    "a plausible explanation for this is the fact , that in joint relaying , the relay always has to come to a compromise , such that not only one but all incoming signals are amplified as good as possible . in the tdma system , the relay has only one incoming signal , which can be optimally amplified by optimizing the relay matrix just for this signal .",
    "in order to confirm the result of theorem [ theo : tdma_better ] , we will evaluate the achievable rates of the tdma - based and joint relaying scheme by some simulations in this section . as stated in the preceding section ,",
    "the tdma - based scheme is strictly better if the channel matrices @xmath117 are statistically independent .",
    "however , the question for the quantitative gain of the tdma - based scheme has to be investigated .    for this purpose ,",
    "we assume channels with independent rayleigh - fading , i.e. , all entries of the channel matricesare @xmath118 and independent from each other .",
    "all results presented in this section are obtained by averaging over 1000 channel realizations .    for a system with @xmath119 users ,",
    "the achievable sum - rates are plotted in figure [ fig : tdmavssp ] .",
    "we assumed that all transmitters and the relay have @xmath120 antennas , while , as a prerequisite of this scenario , the receiver is assumed to have a single antenna .",
    "the transmit power of the users is assumed to be fixed at @xmath121 @xmath122 , while the power of the relay @xmath123 and thus the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio @xmath124 is varied .",
    "it can be observed that , especially for high values of @xmath125 , the performance of the tdma - based scheme is up to @xmath126% better than that of the joint relaying scheme . from further simulations , which are not visualized in this work due to the page constraint",
    ", it could be seen that this gain grows with the number of antennas at the transmitters @xmath12 , the number of antennas at the relay @xmath18 , and with the number of users @xmath0 .",
    "we have considered a @xmath0-user marc with af relaying , where all nodes except the receiver have multiple antennas . for this channel",
    ", we found the optimal solution for a previously introduced transmit strategy @xcite , where all transmitters access the channel jointly .",
    "contrary to this approach , we proposed a transmit strategy that is based on a tdma structure , where each transmitter accesses the channel exclusively . after optimizing the transmit covariance and relaying matrices for this scheme , the optimal time",
    "slot durations were found . comparing the achievable sum - rates of the two strategies",
    ", it could be shown that the tdma - based scheme always performs better in practical systems .",
    "for one specific scenario , a sum - rate gain of up to @xmath126% was observed by simulations .",
    "although these results hold only for marcs with a single - antenna receiver , it can be seen that the transmit strategy of @xcite is not generally optimal for the marc .",
    "hence , for the more general and unsolved marc with a multi - antenna receiver , future research has to answer the question whether tdma can help to increase the achievable sum rates .",
    "the authors would like to thank aydin sezgin for fruitful initial discussions about the topic , which lead to the main ideas of this work .",
    "moreover , the authors thank karlheinz ochs for providing a simplified proof of lemma [ lem : pee_pi ] .",
    "let @xmath127 be the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "then , we have @xmath130 where the first inequality is due to the positive semidefiniteness of @xmath51 and the last inequality can be derived from the rayleigh quotient .",
    "lemma [ lem : pee_pi ] can be equivalently formulated as @xmath131 hence , it is sufficient to show that @xmath132 is a positive semidefinite matrix .",
    "let @xmath133 be the eigenvalues of @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "then , we have @xmath136 where the second inequality holds because we have @xmath137 and thus @xmath138 . using @xmath139 to denote the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath132",
