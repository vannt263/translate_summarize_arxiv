    "self - affine distributions are ubiquitous in many phenomena in nature , such as in growing surfaces and interfaces @xcite , fractured media @xcite , and graphs of two - dimensional turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "self - affine distributions have also been used as a tool to study scaling properties of two - dimensional statistical models by mapping these models to a two - dimensional coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "moreover , crystal growth , the growth of bacterial colonies , and the formation of clouds in the upper atmosphere @xcite are all examples of non - equilibrium phenomena which grow self - affine rough surfaces .",
    "the above applications on a fundamental level make the surface - growth problem as a paradigm for a broad class of problems in the context of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "self - affine surfaces can be described by their height distribution function . from statistical point of view , it is necessary to explore topography of this kind of surfaces . in such surfaces , heights are invariant under re - scaling , namely @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is called the roughness exponent or the _ hurst _ exponent .",

    "if we require translational and rotational invariance of the surface then the structure function of this surface behaves as @xmath6^{2}\\rangle\\sim    formula to calculate the roughness exponent . to determine that a given surface is self - affine or multi - affine we need to measure the @xmath7th order structure function defined by @xmath8 .",

    "the exponent @xmath9 varies linearly with @xmath7 for a self - affine surface . for a multi - affine surface , instead",
    ", it would vary non - linearly with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the fourier space counterpart of the structure function is fourier power spectrum @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 .",
    "equation ( [ structure function ] ) gives the scaling relation for the power spectrum , i.e. , @xmath14 .",

    "the contour lines that are generated by a cut through the surface at a certain height are important in characterizing self - affine surfaces .    in fig .",
    "@xmath26 we plotted an example of the set of contour lines of a rough surface .",
    "the statistical properties of contour lines of rough surfaces show fractal behavior .",
    "the accepted fractal dimension of a contour line @xmath27 was found by kondev and henley ( kh ) by using scaling arguments @xcite .",
    "recently , schramm and sheffield @xcite proved rigorously that the contour lines of gaussian free field with @xmath22 are conformally invariant with fractal dimension @xmath28 , which is in agreement with the kh result .",
    "conformally invariant curves in statistical physics can be investigated by coulomb gas field theory @xcite .",
    "the most well - known loop model that can be investigated by this field theory is the @xmath29 model , which can be defined on the honeycomb lattice as follows : take the ensemble of loops on the honeycomb lattice so that the generating function of the model is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are number of the loops and bonds , respectively , @xmath33 is the weight of each loop , and @xmath5 is the weight of each bond . at the critical point , this loop model can be investigated , after mapping the loop model to the solid on solid ( sos ) model @xcite , by the free field theory @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "it is also possible to find the scaling exponents of conformal curves by the above field theory @xcite .     and @xmath35 ; by zooming in on the picture one can see many small loops .",
    "]    since the height ensemble of a rough surface is not conformally invariant , rigorous investigating of their contour lines is more difficult than the coulomb gas case .",
    "indeed , one can not employ the powerful tools of conformal field theory ( cft ) to study this system . for a rough surface with a generic @xmath1",
    "there is no rigorous proof for results obtained by kh @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it seems that the contour line ensemble shows scaling properties similar to the conformal curves encountered in some models such as the contour lines of tungsten oxide ( @xmath36 ) @xcite and kpz surfaces @xcite .    in this paper , by using techniques which are common in the realm of coulomb gas field theory , we introduce new scaling laws for some properties of contour lines of self - affine rough surfaces .",
    "the scaling properties of the cumulative distribution of the number of contours versus the area of the contours and the size of the system are also obtained .",
    "in addition , we find a close relation between the cumulants of @xmath37 , the area of contour lines , and the eigenvalues of the fractional laplacian . finally , we introduce the scaling property of ranked contour lines versus both rank and system size ( zipf s law ) .",
    "numerical simulations are also provided to substantiate our analysis .",
    "to generate self - affine rough surfaces in our numerical simulations ,    we have used the successive random addition method @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we have generated surfaces of size @xmath38 with @xmath39 . to investigate the effect of roughness exponent on the scaling relations we used several values of @xmath40 . in each case , all calculations have been averaged over 200 realizations .    to generate the loops in the contour lines we used a contouring algorithm that treats the input matrix as a regularly spaced grid .",
    "the algorithm scans this matrix and compares the values of each block of four neighboring elements ( i.e. , a plaquette ) in the matrix to the contour level values .",
    "if a contour level falls within a cell , the algorithm performs a linear interpolation to locate the point at which the contour crosses the edges of the cell .",
    "the algorithm connects these points to produce a segment of a contour line . after generating the contours of a given surface , in order to eliminate the effect of the edges of the lattice we have excluded the contours crossing the edges of the lattice .     for rough surfaces with size @xmath41 and different roughness exponents .",
    "]    to show the goodness of the fits and consistency of our simulations with theory , we used the following three different methods for estimating the exponents : ( _ a _ ) we numerically calculated local slops of the curves by fourth - order numerical differentiation for non - uniform data points ; e.g. , in the case of eq .",

    "a key difference between the contour lines in coulomb gas field theory and the self - affine rough surfaces is in the fractal dimension of the set of all contour lines . for a given self - affine rough surface ,",
    "this fractal dimension is @xmath44 .",
    "it is well - known that many of the scaling relations in coulomb gas field theory remain unchanged just by substituting this @xmath45 as the dimension of our set . to give an example ,",
    "let us define the fractal dimension of a contour line @xmath46 as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the the perimeter of the contour and @xmath49 is the radius of gyration .",
    "moreover , the probability of finding a contour loop with length @xmath48 is @xmath50 .",
    "one can show that there is a hyperscaling relation between the scaling exponents @xmath46 and @xmath51 as follows : @xmath52 which is exactly the same as the hyperscaling relation for domain walls in statistical models @xcite .",
    "following kh , the cumulative distribution of the number of contours with area greater than @xmath37 has the following form : @xmath53 this gives the right answer for coulomb gas loops with zero roughness exponent @xcite .",
    "in the rest of the paper using new conjectures we will demonstrate some other evidences to support the above relation .",
    "this in turn leads us to several new scaling relations .",
    "we checked eq .",
    "( [ cumulative ] ) by using numerical simulations for different @xmath1 s , see fig @xmath54 .",
    "as is shown , we plot @xmath55 versus @xmath56 to show how seriously they follow eq .",
    "( [ cumulative ] ) .",
    "the straight horizontal curves exhibit that the proposed scaling relation is preserved up to @xmath54 orders of magnitude of @xmath37 .",
    "as is seen , in the case of @xmath57 we have a small deviation from the proposed exponent at large values of @xmath37 , which is related to finite - size effects . for a given lattice size and for small values of @xmath1 , there are not so many large contour lines , but we have many small ones .",
    "this is led by the nature of self - affinity at small _ hurst _ exponents .",
    "there are no deviations when we increase @xmath1 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "in table  [ tab1 ] , we report the best fit values calculated by the likelihood analysis @xcite at @xmath58 and @xmath59 confidence levels .",
    ".[tab1 ] the best fit values of exponent @xmath60 derived by using the likelihood method .",

    "cardy and ziff evaluated the total area inside all loops using two different methods , and then they found the universal form of @xmath62 .",
    "inspired by this method , we argue to give some new scaling relations for contour lines of self - affine rough surfaces . using eq .",
    "( [ cumulative ] ) it is straightforward to show that @xmath63 , for @xmath64 , and for @xmath22 it has a logarithmic form .    let us consider a typical point @xmath5 with height @xmath65 above the horizon ( we cut our self - affine surface by a plane ) .",
    "if we draw a circle of radius @xmath66 around the point , since we are dealing with a rough surface , all points inside the circle will be above the horizon . in other words , inside the loop is a compact region with the fractal dimension 2 . since the fractal dimension of the clusters is 2",
    ", one could obtain the total area of the clusters proportional to the area of the system .",
    "this is just a lower bound for the interior areas of the loops  see @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is also possible to see from simulation that by cutting the surface from the average height one could get always clusters of the order of the system size .",
    "thus one can get the following scaling relation for @xmath62 with respect to the system size : @xmath67 this indicates that the number of contour lines with area greater than @xmath37 per total length of all contours , i.e. , @xmath68 , is independent of the system size .",
    "it is also worth noting that the cumulative distribution of the contours with area @xmath37 is independent of @xmath69 , the ultraviolet cutoff , which is another length scale .",
    "our simulations confirm the validity of the scaling relation ( [ c ] ) for different values of @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "@xmath70 .",
    "the above result is also useful to get another nontrivial equation for contour lines . to calculate the total area we can use the formula @xmath71 in which @xmath72 is the minimum number of loops which must be crossed to connect @xmath73 to the edge of the lattice . since the total area inside the loops is proportional to the area of the system , we conclude @xmath74 this is reminiscent of the height correlation function in the self - affine rough surfaces . for @xmath22",
    "the relation is logarithmic and was proved explicitly in @xcite .",

    "these results show that one may investigate contour loops of rough surfaces by defining currents for the loops . again , by analogy with the coulomb gas methods one can define @xmath80 as the current density of loops .",
    "this is a natural candidate if we imagine that the height function is extended to the two - dimensional manifold in such a way that it is constant within each plaquette .",
    "normalization with respect to width is necessary because we have a rough surface where width is changing by size .",
    "this definition for the current density means that we can map our height model to the contour lines or vice versa .",
    "since iso - height lines have the same role as the domain walls between the positive and negative heights , the directional derivative of @xmath65 along a contour must be zero and it must vary along a line normal to the contour . using the above function to parameterize the geometry of contour line , it is possible to write @xmath81 this equation is independent of our definition of currents . by using simple dimensional analysis , it is not difficult to find our special normalization , i.e. , @xmath82 .",

    "( [ current ] ) gives @xmath83 .",

    "in summary , by using field theory of rough surfaces and considering current for the model , we confirmed the previously known scaling relation for cumulative distribution of area .",
    "in addition , we found a new scaling relation for this distribution with respect to system size . since the action is not translationally invariant and the small momenta are important , naturally scaling properties depend to the system size .",
    "it seems that large momenta do not contribute in the scaling properties . although system is not invariant under homogeneous translation , it is not difficult to see that it is invariant under @xmath126 , which means it is inhomogeneously translational invariant . using inhomogeneous translation one can define the currents @xmath127 corresponding to wilson loops of the theory and re - derive the results of sec .",
    "since we only investigated the scaling properties of the contour lines , these two different given currents lead to the same scaling relations .    considering these currents for contour lines",
    "we think that there may be a close relation between the statistics of these lines and the eigenvalues of fractional laplacian . in this paper , we discussed leading scaling behavior with respect to the system size , however , to see the effect of the eigenvalues of the fractional laplacian one needs more careful study of the amplitudes as well . since there is no conformal invariance in the height ensemble ,",

    "we confirmed our proposed scaling relations by simulations through cutting a self - affine surface at different heights .",
    "we have only interpreted the results for the case of cutting the surface at its mean height .",
    "but we checked also all of the scaling relations for the cases of cutting the surface at heights @xmath128 , where @xmath61 is the height variance of the surface .",
    "we have not seen any meaningful deviation from what we obtained for the mean height .",
    "we also introduced new zipf - like scaling relations for the contour lines of self - affine rough surfaces , and verified them via simulations .",
