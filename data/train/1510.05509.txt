    "[ n1n2n3table ] @xmath1     [ brandnewsquaretable ] @xmath2    the well - known squares in figure [ franklinsquares ] were constructed by benjamin franklin .",
    "the square f2 was introduced separately and hence is generally known as _",
    "the other 8-square_. the entries of the squares are from the set @xmath3 , where @xmath4 or @xmath5 . every integer in this set occurs in the square exactly once . for these squares ,",
    "the entries of every row and column add to a common sum called the _ magic sum_. the @xmath6 squares have magic sum 260 and the @xmath7 square has magic sum 2056 . in every half row and half column the entries add to half the magic sum .",
    "the entries of the main bend diagonals and all the bend diagonals parallel to it add to the magic sum .",
    "in addition , observe that every @xmath8 sub - square in f1 and f2 adds to half the magic sum , and in f3 adds to one - quarter the magic sum .",
    "the property of the @xmath9 sub - squares adding to a common sum and the property of bend diagonals adding to the magic sum are _ continuous properties_. by continuous property we mean that if we imagine the square is the surface of a torus ; i.e. opposite sides of the square are glued together , then the bend diagonals or the @xmath10 sub - squares can be translated and still the corresponding sums hold . in fact , these squares have innumerable fascinating properties .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a detailed study of these squares .    from now on ,",
    "row sum , column sum , or bend diagonal sum , etc .",
    "mean that we are adding the entries of those elements .",
    "based on the descriptions of benjamin franklin , we define _ franklin squares _ as follows ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consider an integer , @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "let the magic sum be denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we define an _",
    "@xmath15 franklin square _ to be a @xmath16 matrix with the following properties :    1 .",
    "every integer from the set @xmath3 occurs exactly once in the square .",
    "consequently , @xmath17 2 .",
    "all the the half rows , half columns add to one - half the magic sum .",
    "consequently , all the rows and columns add to the magic sum .",
    "all the bend diagonals add to the magic sum , continuously .",
    "all the @xmath9 sub - squares add to @xmath18 , continuously .",
    "consequently , all the @xmath19 sub - squares add to @xmath20 , and the four corner numbers with the four middle numbers add to @xmath21 .",
    "we call permutations of the entries of a franklin square that preserve the defining properties of the franklin squares _",
    "symmetry operations _ , and two squares are called _ isomorphic _ if we can get one from the other by applying symmetry operations . rotation and reflection",
    "are clearly symmetry operations .",
    "see @xcite for more symmetry operations like exchanging specific rows or columns . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that f1 and f2 are not isomorphic to each other .",
    "constructing franklin squares are demanding and only a handful such squares are known to date .",
    "we showed how to construct f1 , f2 , and f3 using methods from algebra and combinatorics in @xcite . in the same article ,",
    "for the first time since benjamin franklin , we constructed new franklin squares n1 , n2 , and n3 , given in table [ n1n2n3table ] . we proved that these squares were not isomorphic to each other nor to f1 or f2 .",
    "in other words , these squares were really new . those methods being computationally challenging are not suitable for higher order franklin squares",
    "moreover , the constructions used computers and hence lacked the intrigue of franklin s constructions . in @xcite",
    ", we followed benjamin franklin closely , and used elementary techniques to construct a franklin square of every order . with these techniques we are able to construct f1 and f3 , but not f2 . in section [ constructsection ] , we modify the methods in @xcite to construct f2 . in section [ newconstructsection ] , we create new franklin squares b1 and b2 , given in table [ brandnewsquaretable ] , but this time using elementary techniques , in keeping with the true spirit of benjamin franklin .",
    "in this section , we show how to construct the franklin square f2 .",
    "we present a quick recap of our construction of f1 in @xcite . note that @xmath23 throughout this article .",
    "the @xmath24 square was divided in to two halves : the left half consisting of first four columns and the right half consisting of the last four columns .",
    "the left half is constructed by first placing the numbers @xmath25 in a specific pattern as shown in figure [ f1leftconstruct ] .",
    "then , the number @xmath26 is placed in the same row that contains @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , such that @xmath27 and @xmath26 are always equidistant from the middle of the left half . see figure [ f1leftconstruct ] .",
    "similarly , the second half is constructed by first placing numbers @xmath29 in a specific pattern .",
    "finally , the numbers @xmath26 is placed in the same row that contains @xmath27 , where @xmath30 , such that @xmath27 and @xmath26 are always equidistant from the middle of the right half .",
    "this procedure is explained in figure [ f1rightconstruct ] .",
    "the algorithm for generating the pattern of @xmath31 in f1 is given in @xcite .",
    "we also generalized this procedure to construct a franklin square for any given order in @xcite .",
    "from now on , throughout the article , when we say _ pattern of a square _ , we mean the pattern of the numbers @xmath31 in the square .        in our search for new franklin squares ,",
    "it is natural to swap rows for columns in the above method .",
    "thus , we divide the @xmath6 square in to two halves : the top half consisting of the first four rows and the bottom half consisting of the last four rows .",
    "we place the numbers @xmath32 in the bottom half , and the numbers @xmath33 in the top half in the pattern shown in figure [ columnsconstruct ] . this time we place the numbers @xmath26 in the same columns as @xmath27 , equidistant from the middle of each part .",
    "the franklin square s we get from this procedure is isomorphic to f1 : check that we can derive this square from f1 by rotating it and then reflecting it .",
    "the square s is not interesting because it is essentially the same as f1 .",
    "but the pattern of entering the numbers @xmath31 in s is algorithmic since it is just a row version of the pattern of f1 . that is , instead of filling two columns at a time , we fill two rows at a time .",
    "we modify the pattern of s to get a pattern for f2 .",
    "after that , we place @xmath26 in the same column as @xmath27 , for @xmath34 , equidistant from the center of each half , as usual . see figure [ f2constructfig ] for the construction of f2 .",
    "the construction of f2 involved moving columns of in the @xmath35 pattern of the square s and then switching elements along the diagonals .",
    "this pattern is not easily generalized to higher orders .",
    "but in the next section , we modify the patterns of known squares to create new squares .",
    "in this section we construct the new franklin squares b1 and b2 ( see table [ brandnewsquaretable ] ) .",
    "to begin with , we look at the patterns of the numbers @xmath36 appearing in the franklin squares n1 , n2 , and n3 .",
    "these are shown in figure [ nipatternsfig ] .",
    "we found that even in these squares that were constructed using hilbert bases ( see @xcite ) , the strategy of finding the pattern of the franklin square , and then placing @xmath27 and @xmath26 in the same row or column , as the case may be , equidistant from the center of relevant half of the square , worked .",
    "observe that the patterns of n1 and n2 are derived by modifying the pattern of f2 .",
    "so in their constructions , we will place @xmath27 and @xmath26 in the same columns . on the other hand , since",
    ", n3 is a permutation of the pattern of f1 , we place @xmath27 and @xmath26 in the same rows while constructing n3 .",
    "benjamin franklin s patterns always restrict the entries @xmath37 to one half of the square .",
    "observe that n2 is the only square with this property .    guided by these observations",
    ", we modified the pattern of f2 to build the new franklin squares b1 and b2 .",
    "see figure [ b1b2pattern ] for the patterns of b1 and b2 .",
    "since the patterns were derived from f2 , to construct them , we will place @xmath27 and @xmath26 in the same columns .",
    "b1 and b2 are not isomorphic to each other or any other known squares because the columns were made different by construction ."
