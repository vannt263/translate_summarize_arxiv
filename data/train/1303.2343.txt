    "the differences between hermiticity and self - adjointness of quantum mechanical operators @xcite were first understood by von neumann @xcite , but are rarely emphasized in the quantum mechanics textbook literature .",
    "even standard textbook problems such as a particle confined to a box @xcite or endowed with a point interaction @xcite become much richer when studied systematically in the context of self - adjointly extended hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "self - adjoint extensions arise naturally at spatial boundaries , such as the interfaces in semiconductor heterostructures including quantum dots , quantum wires , and quantum wells @xcite , or at singular points , e.g.  at the location of a cosmic string or vortex , which may manifest themselves as the tip of a cone in @xmath0 space - time dimensions @xcite . at a spatial boundary ,",
    "a real - valued self - adjoint extension parameter characterizes the so - called robin boundary conditions , which interpolate between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "robin boundary conditions have also been used in quantum field theory , for example , in investigations of the casimir effect @xcite and of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the confinement of atoms or molecules in a finite region of space is an important subject in nanotechnology @xcite .",
    "recently , we have derived a generalized heisenberg uncertainty relation for a quantum dot with general robin boundary conditions @xcite . as special cases ,",
    "we have investigated electrons in a spherical cavity bound to its center by harmonic @xcite or coulomb forces @xcite , with a focus on the resulting accidental symmetries @xcite .",
    "general robin boundary conditions may lead to bound states localized on the confining wall . in these cases",
    ", we have encountered bulk - boundary resonances whose wave functions are partly localized near the boundary and partly near the center of the cavity .",
    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics has deepened the understanding of quantum mechanics by associating a chain of supersymmetric descendants to a given quantum mechanical hamiltonian @xcite . in this way",
    ", the number of analytically solvable quantum mechanical problems has been extended significantly .",
    "general point interactions have been investigated in the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in @xcite . here",
    "we study the superpartners of self - adjointly extended hamiltonians .",
    "remarkably , these are not automatically self - adjoint .",
    "in particular , only a 3-parameter sub - family of the general 4-parameter family of self - adjointly extended hamiltonians on a punctured line have supersymmetric descendants that are themselves self - adjoint .",
    "we also construct the self - adjoint extensions of an operator related to the supercharge .",
    "since we consider a hamiltonian and its supersymmetric descendant as two different physical systems , rather than as two parts of the same system , only a sub - class of self - adjoint extensions of this operator is physical .",

    "first , we consider positive energy states of even parity for which @xmath204 it is straightforward to work out the equation for the corresponding energy values . for @xmath168 , one obtains @xmath205 while for @xmath170 @xmath206 similarly , for the parity - odd states of positive energy one has @xmath207 in that case , for @xmath168 , one obtains @xmath206 while for @xmath170 @xmath208 this shows that the energy spectrum of the even ( odd ) parity states for @xmath168 and @xmath128 is the same as the one of the odd ( even ) parity states for @xmath170 and @xmath209 .",
    "let us also consider negative energy states , first with even parity @xmath210 for @xmath168 , one then obtains @xmath211 while for @xmath170 @xmath212 similarly , for the negative energy states with odd parity @xmath213,\\ ] ] with @xmath168 one finds @xmath214 and with @xmath170 one obtains @xmath215 the corresponding energy spectrum is illustrated in figure 6 , both for a repulsive and for an attractive point interaction .",
    "+ 1.2 cm      in the bottom panel of figure 6 , at negative values of @xmath49 , one notices an avoided level crossing between the ground state and the second excited state .",
    "such avoided level crossings are characteristic of a resonance in a finite volume @xcite . in this case",
    ", we encounter a bulk - boundary resonance , with the particle partially localized at the walls , and partially at the center of the box , due to the attractive point interaction . for definiteness , we set @xmath168 .",
    "the situation for @xmath170 is analogous .    as a resonance condition ,",
    "let us demand equal probability density at the walls and at the center , i.e.  @xmath216 .",

    ", the first excited state is unaffected by the point interaction and is identical with the one of just the particle in the box .",
    "the ground state and the second excited state , on the other hand , resonate with one another and are both localized on the walls as well as on the puncture at @xmath70 . in the spectrum , the resonance manifests itself by an avoided level crossing . when one proceeds to the supersymmetric descendant , the ground state is removed and the first excited state of the original system turns into the ground state of the superpartner .",
    "interestingly , while this state was unaffected by the attractive point interaction of the original system , it is affected by the repulsive point interaction of the supersymmetric descendant .",
    "similarly , the second excited state of the original system , which was affected by the attractive point interaction , turns into the first excited state of the superpartner , but is now unaffected by its repulsive point interaction .",
    "what has become of the resonance of the two states , now that the original ground state has been removed from the supersymmetric descendant ?",
    "as we see from the right panel of figure 7 , the superpartner has a double - well potential , and its ground and first excited states are almost degenerate , with a splitting due to tunneling processes between the two wells .",
    "indeed , the regions near the walls and near the puncture , which were energetically favored in the original system , are disfavored in the supersymmetric descendant .",
    "this shows how one and the same spectrum ( except for the ground state @xmath220 ) can arise from quite different physical phenomena , in one case a bulk - boundary resonance , in the other case tunneling in a double - well potential .",
    "the corresponding situation for @xmath170 is illustrated in figure 8 , which confirms that the spectrum is the same as for @xmath168 , but even and odd parity states exchange their roles .",
    "in particular , the ground state is now parity - odd , and the first excited state is parity - even .",
    "we have investigated the supersymmetric descendants of self - adjointly extended hamiltonians .",
    "the infinite - wall boundary condition of a particle on a half - line is characterized by a family of self - adjoint extensions , parameterized by @xmath35 .",
    "interestingly , all corresponding supersymmetric descendants have @xmath53 and thus obey standard dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "a particle on a punctured line with a point interaction at the puncture @xmath40 is characterized by a 4-parameter family of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "remarkably , in that case , the corresponding supersymmetric descendants are not automatically self - adjoint .",
    "indeed , only a 3-parameter sub - family of hamiltonians has supersymmetric descendants which are themselves self - adjoint .",
    "this sub - family is characterized by the continuity of the probability density at the puncture .",
    "we have also constructed the self - adjoint extensions of the operator @xmath27 constructed from the supercharge .",
    "they form a 1-parameter family on the half - line , and a 4-parameter family on the punctured line . yet , only one specific value of the self - adjoint extension parameter ( namely @xmath114 ) is physical on the half - line , and only a 2-parameter sub - class is physical on the punctured line .",
    "this is because we have considered @xmath15 and @xmath14 as two distinct physical systems , and not as two parts of a bigger system .",
    "while there is a 1-parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath15 on the half - line ( parameterized by @xmath49 ) , there is no remaining self - adjoint extension parameter in @xmath27 , after we put @xmath114 .",
    "this is because the information on @xmath49 is encoded in the superpotential .",
    "similarly , on the punctured line there is a 3-parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath15 ( parameterized by @xmath126 , @xmath128 , and @xmath127 ) , for which the supersymmetric descendant @xmath14 is also self - adjoint . at the same time",
    ", there is only a 2-parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath27 ( parameterized by @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "this is again because the information about the third parameter @xmath128 is encoded in the superpotential .",
    "this clarifies the relations between the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we have also examined concrete problems of a particle in a box , with or without an additional point interaction . among other things",
    ", we found that the standard textbook problem of a particle in a box with dirichlet boundary conditions is itself a supersymmetric descendant .",
    "its supersymmetric precursor is the corresponding problem with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "robin boundary conditions with @xmath181 give rise to negative energy states localized at the walls .",
    "such boundary states can resonate with states localized in the bulk , which gives rise to an avoided level crossing in a finite volume .",
    "we have investigated the supersymmetric descendant of such a resonance and found that it corresponds to two almost degenerate states in a double - well potential .    by applying self - adjoint extensions to supersymmetric quantum mechanics",
    ", we have extended the set of exactly solvable quantum mechanics problems .",
    "self - adjoint extensions are not just a mathematical curiosity , but have great physical relevance .",
    "the self - adjoint extension parameters just characterize the low - energy features of an idealized boundary , such as an impenetrable infinite energy barrier , or an ultra - short - range attractive potential in a tiny region of space . using the theory of self - adjoint extensions",
    "greatly simplifies the modeling of such situations .",
    "in fact , some of the calculations performed here are so simple that they could easily be incorporated into the teaching of quantum mechanics .",
