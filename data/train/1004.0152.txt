    "ad hoc networks operate on the basis of multi - hop routing , which allows information to be communicated across the network over a series of hops .",
    "end - to - end performance depends critically on the quality of the multi - hop routes used , but choosing good routes in a dynamic network ( e.g. one where nodes are moving quickly ) is a particularly difficult task .",
    "opportunistic routing ( e.g @xcite - @xcite ) is well suited to such dynamic settings , as it can be performed with low overhead while also exploiting spatial diversity ( in terms of fading and topology ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a purely opportunistic routing protocol , in which nodes broadcast packets in a completely blind manner ( i.e. without any knowledge of surrounding nodes ) .",
    "more specifically , the protocol is described as follows :    1 .   in each time slot , each node randomly decides , with some fixed probability , to either transmit or receive .",
    "a transmitting node will blindly broadcast a packet at some fixed spectral efficiency , whereas receivers listen for any transmission .",
    "all receiver nodes that successfully decode the packet will send an ack back to the transmitting node during an acknowledgement period .",
    "the ack packets contain absolute geographic information about the rx location .",
    "4 .   the transmitter selects the successful receiver which offers the most progress towards the packet s final destination and sends a message to that node electing it to become the next forwarder .",
    "this protocol allows for the instantaneous choice of the best next hop , at the cost of an acknowledgement period and with the requirement for geographical information . within this algorithm , the key adjustable parameters are the _ transmission probability _ and the transmission _",
    "spectral efficiency_.    the transmission probability , denoted by @xmath0 , determines the proportion of transmitters to receivers in each slot .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , there is a large amount of interference between the nodes .",
    "this interference will cause only receivers close to transmitters to be potential forwarders . when the transmission probability is low , there are fewer simultaneous transmissions and thus less interference and more available relays .",
    "thus longer hops are possible , but in fewer numbers . as a result ,",
    "the trade - off with transmission probability is essentially between many simultaneous short hops , or fewer long hops .",
    "when the spectral efficiency is high , a large signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) is required to decode .",
    "thus , only relays which are close to the transmitter are likely to decode . on the other hand",
    ", a lower spectral efficiency allows nodes that are farther away to decode .",
    "therefore , the trade - off with spectral efficiency is between shorter hops at higher data rate or longer hops at a lower data rate .",
    "the objective of this paper is determining the transmission probability and spectral efficiency that optimally balance these trade - offs .",
    "we study blind opportunistic routing in a spatial model , as in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "end - to - end performance is characterized by the forward - rate - density , which is the product of average transmitter density , average hop distance and transmission rate ( spectral efficiency ) .",
    "this is a function of measured network properties ( e.g. path - loss exponent ) and adjustable parameters ( spectral efficiency and transmission probability ) .",
    "our objective is to find the transmission probability and transmission spectral efficiency that maximize this metric . studying",
    "this quantity directly is intractable , however we derive a reasonably accurate approximation and reinforce the conclusions with monte carlo simulations .",
    "consider an infinite set of transmit / receive nodes @xmath1 distributed according to a homogeneous 2-d poisson point process ( ppp ) with density @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "we consider a slotted transmission scheme . in each slot",
    "a node elects to become a transmitter with probability @xmath0 , independent across users and slots .",
    "the set of locations of the transmitters ( tx1 , tx2 , .. ) denoted @xmath4 and the set of locations of the receivers @xmath5 then form independent ppp s of intensity @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "we consider a path - loss model with exponent @xmath8 and rayleigh fading coefficients @xmath9 from tx @xmath10 to rx @xmath11 . denoting the signal transmitted by tx@xmath10 ( located at @xmath12 ) as @xmath13 , the received signal of rx@xmath11 ( at location @xmath14 )",
    "is given by :    @xmath15    for the time being , consider the network is interference limited , so thermal noise ( @xmath16 ) is negligible .",
    "the case of a channel with thermal noise is considered in sec [ sec : numerical_results ] .    assuming the transmit powers are all equal , the sir ( signal to interference ratio ) from tx @xmath10 to rx @xmath11 is defined : @xmath17 we assume that all users transmit at rate equal to @xmath18 ; thus a communication is successful if and only if the received sir is larger than a threshold value @xmath19 .",
    "although we are interested in the network - wide performance of the protocol , by the homogeneity of the ppp this is statistically equivalent to the performance of any transmitter .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we can focus on tx@xmath20 located at the origin . from the perspective of tx@xmath20 , all the other tx nodes form a homogeneous ppp with intensity @xmath6 ( by slivnyaks theorem @xcite , the distribution is unaffected by conditioning on the presence of tx@xmath20 ) .",
    "the transmitters and receivers are ordered by their distance to the origin i.e. tx1 is closest to the origin , tx2 the next , etc . for the sake of simplicity , the sir from tx@xmath20 to rx@xmath11",
    "is denoted @xmath21 and is given by @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the transmitter located at the origin has a packet to be sent to a receiver a very large distance away ( e.g. , fig . [ fig : net_ex ] ) .",
    "specifically , we assume the final destination is located an infinite distance away along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "thus , the relay offering the most progress is the one with the maximum @xmath23-coordinate amongst the set of receivers that successfully decode tx@xmath20 s packet .",

    "@xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this quantity is the expected progress ( towards the destination ) made in each hop .",

    "/ hz , this means that the maximum end - to - end data rate ( per node ) is @xmath34}.\\ ] ] thus , @xmath30 is directly proportional to end - to - end rate .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 , which is deterministic , is a function of transmission probability @xmath0 and sir threshold @xmath19 .",
    "we seek the optimal values of @xmath19 and @xmath0 which maximize this product : @xmath35 a closed - form expression for @xmath30 can not be found in general , so we rely on an approximation which is developed in the following section .",
    "the basis of our approximation to @xmath30 is the concept of an sir cell @xcite , @xcite . in the absence of fading ,",
    "any rx within a particular region ( i.e. , the sir cell ) around a tx can decode , and the best forwarder is the rx in this region with the largest @xmath23-coordinate .",
    "therefore , the forward progress is determined by the sir cell  which is completely determined by the interferer locations and thus is a function only of the interferer process  and by the receiver locations ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) . to reach a tractable approximation for @xmath30 ,",
    "we remove the randomness in the sir cell and assume it is a deterministic region that is a function of @xmath0 and @xmath19 , while retaining the randomness in @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the average size of the sir cell .",
    "this quantity is clearly defined in the absence of fading . on the other hand ,",
    "the sir cell is not well defined with fading because the sir depends on independent fading rv s ( specific to each receiver location ) in addition to the interferer locations .",
    "however , we can derive a quantity analogous to the sir cell area , denoted by @xmath36 , by integrating the point - wise success probability over all space . from @xcite , the success probability for a rx a distance @xmath37 from the tx",
    "is : @xmath38 \\\\",

    ".    we will then assume the sir cell has area equal to its mean .",
    "we now approximate the sir cell by a square centered on tx@xmath20 with side @xmath43 .",

    "thus , our approximation to the progress - rate - density is : @xmath50 the optimal values then are the solution to the equation @xmath51 although there is no closed form solution to this equation , the approximation nonetheless yields valuable insight . by rearranging the terms in ( [ eqn : fp ] ) , we can interpret the forward progress approximation as the product of the maximum possible relay distance ( i.e. , half the side - length of the sir cell ) and a fractional term that captures how much of the maximum is attained by the best receiver .",
