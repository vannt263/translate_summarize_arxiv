    "observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) indicate that currently the observable universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "this cosmic acceleration has also been confirmed by numerous observations of large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite and measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the cause for this cosmic acceleration is generally dubbed as `` dark energy '' , a mysterious exotic energy which generates large negative pressure , whose energy density is dominated the universe ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the astrophysical nature of dark energy is that it does not cluster at any scale unlike normal baryonic matter which form structures .",
    "the combined analysis of cosmological observations suggests that the universe is spatially flat , and consists of about 70% dark energy , 30% dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and negligible radiation .",
    "the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain enigmatic at present .",
    "the future of the universe crucially depends on the nature of dark energy : if it is quintessence ( having equation of state parameter eos @xmath0 ) then the energy density of quintessence dilutes with the expansion and the acceleration will be replaced by deceleration in far future ; if the cause of cosmic acceleration is cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) then the universe will accelerate forever since its constant energy density provides a continuous source of vacuum energy to produce acceleration ; however if the dark energy is phantom energy ( @xmath2 ) then acceleration of the universe will convert into super - acceleration in far future which will eventually destroy every gravitationally stable structure in the universe @xcite .    in recent years , the thermodynamics of the accelerating universe has got much attention and numerous interesting results are obtained . in particular , the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics has been widely studied in the cosmological context ; the law states that the entropy of a closed isolated system along with the entropy of its boundary is always an increasing function of time .",
    "it needs to be stressed that this law has some informal proofs but on several instances in cosmology , it is violated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the validity of gsl crucially depends on the choice of boundary of the frw universe : for instance the gsl is respected if the frw boundary is the dynamical apparent horizon @xcite but it is conditionally valid if the boundary is future event horizon @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we choose the boundary as the future event horizon and show that the gsl is violated in all the cases studied in this paper .",
    "the main motivation and the organization of this work are as follows : in section ii , we introduce basic equations and solutions for dbi - essence model .",
    "two particular solutions are found and the scalar field and corresponding potentials are analyzed . in section iii , we calculate statefinder parameters for dbi dark energy and its nature are investigated during evolution of the universe . in section iv , we develop correspondence between dbi - essence and modified chaplygin gas and reconstruct the potential and warped brane tension as well as dynamics of scalar field are analyzed for two types of solutions . in section",
    "v , we study gsl in the presence of mcg and dbi - essence and examine the validity of gsl during evolution of the universe bounded by the event horizon .",
    "final section is devoted to the discussion .",
    "note that a simple scalar field , a ` quintessence field ' , is a suitable candidate as an alternative to the ` cosmological constant ' @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the scalar fields depend on the scalar potentials . however , scalar fields with inverse power - law potentials have attracted lot of research interests since in this case the equations of motion yield attractor solutions .",
    "it ensures that the late time behavior of the universe is independent to the choice of arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "however , this exquisite behavior of the quintessence field comes at a price of extreme fine - tuning of the cosmological parameters .",
    "this problem of fine - tuning can be resolved if the quintessence field is modeled via approaches beyond the standard model of particle physics , for instance , string theory @xcite . in this paper , we proceed with a scalar field model where the kinetic term is non - canonical .",
    "such non - canonical terms in the lagrangian generally appear in the braneworld gravity @xcite . here",
    ", the kinetic term has a dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) form .",
    "physically , this originates from the fact that the action of the system is proportional to the volume traced out by the brane during its motion .",
    "this volume is given by the square - root of the induced metric which automatically leads to a dbi kinetic term @xcite .",
    "the action of the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) scalar field @xmath3 can be written as ( choosing @xmath4 ) @xcite @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the self - interacting potential and @xmath7 is the warped brane tension . in the later analysis , we shall determine exact forms of these two functions .",
    "now let us consider the matter content of the universe is composed of dbi type dark energy scalar field .",
    "the background spacetime is the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) , for which the einstein field equations are @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter .",
    "notice that @xmath11 produces super - acceleration while @xmath12 corresponds to accelerated expansion due to cosmological constant .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the scalar field are respectively given by @xmath13 @xmath14 where the quantity @xmath15 is reminiscent from the usual relativistic lorentz factor and is given by @xmath16 from above expression ( 6 ) , we observe that @xmath17 and @xmath18 always . from ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) we have @xmath19 which is always @xmath20 . from energy conservation equation",
    ", we have the wave equation for @xmath3 as @xmath21=0.\\ ] ] now we consider two cases : ( i ) @xmath22 constant and ( ii ) @xmath23 constant .    * case i : * @xmath22 constant . in this case , assume @xmath24 , ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 , ( @xmath27 is a positive constant ) so that @xmath28 . in these choices",
    "we have the following solutions : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 where , @xmath33,\\nonumber\\\\ a_{0}&=&\\big(\\frac{3\\gamma c\\sqrt{(\\gamma-1)n+m}}{\\sqrt{3}[2(m - n)+(2n-1)\\gamma^{3}]}\\big)^{\\beta},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants . from ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , we see that @xmath7 and @xmath6 always decrease as @xmath3 increases .    for this solution ,",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath37 becomes , @xmath38 for acceleration of the universe , @xmath37 must be negative i.e. @xmath39 and hence @xmath40 .",
    "* case ii * : @xmath23 constant .",
    "let us assume , @xmath41 , so from ( 6 ) we have @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath43 , so that we have @xmath44 .",
    "let us also assume @xmath45 .",
    "in this case , we have the solutions : @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the integration constant and the expression for deceleration parameter @xmath37 as @xmath49 from ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , we see that the solution is valid for @xmath50 . for acceleration of the universe , @xmath37 must be negative i.e , @xmath51 .",
    "since there are various candidates for the dark energy model , we often face with the problem of discriminating between them , which were solved by introducing statefinder parameters @xcite . these statefinder diagnostic pair i.e. , @xmath52 parameters are of the form : @xmath53 these parameters are dimensionless and allow us to characterize the properties of dark energy in a model independent manner .",
    "the statefinder is dimensionless and is constructed from the scale factor of the universe and its time derivatives only .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 forms the next step in the hierarchy of geometrical cosmological parameters after @xmath55 and @xmath37 . for cosmological constant with a fixed equation of state ( @xmath1 ) and a fixed newton s gravitational constant",
    ", we have @xmath56 .",
    "moreover @xmath57 represents the standard cold dark matter model containing no radiation while einstein static universe corresponds to @xmath58 @xcite . in literature ,",
    "the diagnostic pair is analyzed for various dark energy candidates including holographic dark energy @xcite , agegraphic dark energy @xcite , quintessence @xcite , dilaton dark energy @xcite , yang - mills dark energy @xcite , viscous dark energy @xcite , interacting dark energy @xcite , tachyon @xcite , modified chaplygin gas @xcite and @xmath59 gravity @xcite to name a few .    in case",

    "ii , we have found the relation between density and pressure as @xmath63 and the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath60 as @xmath64 the behavior of the parameters @xmath65 in ( 19 ) is shown in fig.1 . from the figure ,",
    "we have seen that @xmath60 decreases from some negative value to @xmath66 as @xmath54 increases upto a certain stage but they obey negative sign .",
    "after that @xmath60 also decreases from @xmath67 to some negative value as @xmath54 increases from negative label to positive label during evolution of the universe .",
    "for the dbi model in case ii.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "here , it is interesting to find the possible relation between the dbi - essence and the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) @xcite .",
    "the mcg best fits with the @xmath68year wmap and the sdss data with the choice of parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite which are improved constraints than the previous ones @xmath71 @xcite .",
