    "this paper is the cumulative exposition of a series of preliminary results reported on various scientific meetings and partly published in nemirprl06 and in @xcite .",
    "it concerns an important role of the fusion and breakdown processes of vortex loops in the whole dynamics of a network of vortex filaments in superfluid helium .",
    "a network of one - dimensional singularities appears in various physical systems . as examples we would point out vortices in quantum fluids both in turbulent regimes ( see ,",
    "e.g. , book @xcite and papers @xcite , vinen,@xcite ) and in a thermodynamically equilibrium  state ( zurek96 , @xcite ) .",
    "other examples are the flux tubes in superconductors @xcite , dislocations in solids @xcite , global cosmic strings @xcite,@xcite and polymer chains @xcite .",
    "a network of one - dimensional singularities greatly affects many properties of the system where they appear , such as phase transition , thermodynamic and flow properties , structure formation , etc .",
    "therefore , the study of the evolution of these networks is the actual problem .",
    "the evolution of a network of chaotic sets of lines consists of two main ingredients .",
    "the first is the motion of the elements of lines , due to equations of the motion , different for each of the cases listed above .",
    "for instance , the elements of vortex filaments in superfluid @xmath4he move obeying the biot - savart law supplemented by the friction force and the external flow / counterflow if any .",
    "cosmic strings move with the speed close to the speed of light @xmath5 up to some geometrical factor@xcite .",
    "velocities of molecules in a polymer chain are determined either by thermal fluctuations of background or by the velocity fluctuations of the surrounding solvent.we will call this ingredient of the evolution as a deterministic motion of lines .    beside the motion of the each individual loops",
    "there is another very important constituent of the whole dynamics , common for all systems , which relates to the collision of loops , or intersection of elements of vortex lines . during intersection of lines the very complicated process , related to arrangement of",
    "the vortex core takes place @xcite .",
    "however this process is relatively short , therefore it is usually accepted that the filaments instantly reconnect whenever they intersect each other .",
    "reconnections of lines result in random fusion and breakdown ( recombination ) of the loops @xcite .",
    "the processes of recombination are schematically depicted in fig . 1 .     and @xmath6.,width=453 ]    on the left picture we depicted the process of fusion of two loops with lengths @xmath7and @xmath8 and forming the loop with length @xmath9 .",
    "on the right picture we depicted the self - intersection and break down of loop of the length @xmath0 into two daughter loops with lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 the rates of these processes are characterized by the rate coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath6 correspondingly.it is widely appreciated that the `` recombination '' processes greatly influence both the structure and dynamics of the vortex tangle .",
    "for instance , feynman in his pioneering paper @xcite devoted to superfluid turbulence proposed that the vortex tangle decays due to the cascade - like process of consequent breaking down of vortex loops , and degenerating them into thermal excitations .",
    "this scenario is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "the feynman s idea was confirmed in various numerical calculations , where the procedure of artificial elimination of small loops had been used @xcite-@xcite .        to clarify the role of recombination , let us perform the following numerical estimation .",
    "the full rate of reconnection @xmath13  ( per unit volume ) as a function of the vortex line density @xmath14 had been obtained in papers @xcite,@xcite ( see also subsection iv.3 ) @xmath15where @xmath16 is the constant of order of unity and @xmath17 @xmath18/s is the quantum of circulation .",
    "let us take , for instance , some typical experiments with superfluid turbulence , with the counterflowing velocity of order of @xmath19 cm / s and with experimental volume of order of @xmath19 cm . under these conditions the typical value of the vortex line density @xmath14 is about @xmath20 .",
    "interline space @xmath21 is of order @xmath22 , this quantity coincides with the mean radius of curvature .",
    "then the full rate of reconnection @xmath13 is of the order of @xmath23 collisions per second ( per unit volume ) . dividing it by @xmath24",
    "we obtain that the rate of reconnection per unit length of the vortex filaments is @xmath25 and is of the order of @xmath26 .",
    "let us take  a loop of length of ten of interline space , @xmath27 @xcite@xmath28 this loop undergoes ( on average ) @xmath29 reconnections . per one second , or in other words",
    "it exists ( on average ) @xmath30 seconds without reconnection ( as a whole ) .",
    "@xmath31 on the other hand , the own vortex filament dynamics ( kelvin waves dynamics ) is a much slower process . for instances ,",
    "if we take again a loop with length @xmath32 , then any signal on the loop ( for instance , degradation of singularity appeared due to the reconnection event ) takes time about @xmath33 seconds .",
    "thus , the characteristic time of the kelvin waves dynamics exceeds time of existence of the loop by @xmath34 times ( ! ! ! ) .",
    "if one takes a smaller loop the situation will be about the same ( with other quantitative estimations ) .",
    "in fact up to the smallest loops of the size of interline space , the time of `` life '' without reconnection is shorter than time of kelvin wave running around the loop . only for the scale of the order of interline space @xmath21 these times are of the same order .",
    "but this means that loops ( as a whole ) do not live long enough to perform any essential evolution due to the deterministic motion . _ _ on the contrary , they frequently merge and split , therefore these recombination processes are the fastest and  the basic approach to study of superfluid turbulence should be grounded on consideration of a set of randomly merging and splitting loops . _",
    "_     it is necessary to do the following two remarks .",
    "first , considering superfluid turbulence as evolution of  a network of vortex loops we restrict ourselves to the scales of the least loops , which likely coincide with interline space .",
    "we are not interested here in what is happening for smaller scales .",
    "it is a separate topic connected to evolution of the bending vibrations of vortex lines or the so - called kelvin waves@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this question is of a great interest from point of the vortex tangle decay .",
    "second , we do not consider here the case when the vortex lines are strongly polarized so that the coarse - grained motion induced by the bundles of filaments imitates classical ( kolmogorov ) turbulence ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we consider here the case of the so - called vinen turbulence , when the vortex loops are highly disordered with zero mean vorticity.in spite of the recognized importance of the fusion and breakdown processes for the evolution of a network of loops , the numerical results remain the main source of information about this process .",
    "the obvious lack of theoretical investigations interferes with the deep insight in the nature of this phenomena ( this situation had been recently discussed in barenghi2004 ) .",
    "the scarcity of analytic investigations related to the incredible complexity of the problem .",
    "indeed , we have to deal with a set of objects ( vortex loops ) , which do not have a fixed number of elements , they can be born and die . thus , some analog of the secondary quantization method is required with the difference that the objects ( vortex loops ) themselves possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom with very involved dynamics .",
    "clearly , this problem can be hardly resolved in the nearest future .",
    "some approach crucially reducing the number of degrees of freedom is required.there are various ways to overcome this problem .",
    "for instance , one approach elaborated in context of lambda - transition ( @xcite ) is to think of the vortex loops as a set of rings of different sizes and to take their radius as the only degree of freedom .",
    "another approach elaborated in the context of  cosmic strings ( see @xcite and references therein ) is to imagine the vortex loops as having the brownian or the random walk structure .",
    "this can be motivated by the following consideration .",
    "because of the huge number of random collisions ( see ( [ recon_rate ] ) ) the structure of any loop is determined by numerous previous reconnections .",
    "therefore , any loop consists of small parts , which `` remember '' previous collisions .",
    "this is depicted schematically  in fig .",
    "points indicate the sites where the previous reconnections occurred .",
    "waves on the curve are just kelvin waves propagating from these sites",
    ". fragments of the line between the points of previous reconnections are uncorrelated since deterministic kelvin wave signals initiated by collisions of filaments do not have time to propagate far enough .",
    "therefore the loop has a structure of the random walk ( like a polymer chain ) .",
    "the main mathematical tool to describe the random walk is the wiener distribution .",
    "we will use it in a form of the so - called generalized wiener distribution ( see @xcite and appendix a of the present paper ) , which allows to take into account the finite curvature . here",
    "we consider the case of isotropic loops , omitting a possible variant of the polarized loops having their own impulse . in this case",
    "the average loop can be imagined as the consisting of many arches with the mean radius of curvature equal @xmath35 , randomly ( but smoothly ) connected to each other .",
    "quantity @xmath35 is the important parameter of the approach .",
    "it plays a role of the `` elementary step '' in the theory of polymer .",
    "it is low cut - of of the approach developed , the theory does not describe scales smaller then @xmath36 having quantity @xmath35 the only degree of freedom of the random walk is the length of loop @xmath0 . resuming the said above we consider the vortex tangle as a collection of vortex loops having various lengths @xmath0 , and our goal now is to find distribution function @xmath1 of the number of loops in space of their lengths .",
    "knowing quantity @xmath37 and statistics of each personal loop we are able to evaluate various properties of the real vortex tangle    the paper is organized as follows . in the next , second section",
    "we derive the `` kinetic '' boltzmann type equation for distribution function @xmath1 and specify the coefficients , entering it .",
    "in section iii , we obtain the power - like stationary solution to the kinetic equation and describe its properties .",
    "section iv is devoted to the structure and dynamics of the real vortex tangle in turbulent he ii obtained on the base of the developed approach . in particulary , we obtained analytically the equation for evolution of the vortex line density ( vinen equation ) and discuss its properties .",
    "two topics are relegated to appendices : the gaussian model of vortex loops ( appendix a ) and detailed calculation of coefficients of the kinetic equation ( appendix b ) .",
    "in introduction we exposed arguments that vortex loops composing the vortex tangle have a random walk structure , which can be described with use of the generalized wiener distribution .",
    "we take parameters of this distribution not to be changed while recombination , so the only degree of freedom of the loop is its length @xmath0 .",
    "this point of view coincides with conception elaborated in paper @xcite , where similar problem had been studied in context of cosmic strings . following this work we introduce distribution function @xmath37 , the density of loops in space  of their lengths .",
    "it is defined as the number of loops ( per unit of volume ) with lengths lying between @xmath0 and @xmath38 .",
    "there are two mechanisms for change of @xmath39 the first one is the mentioned above deterministic process of evolution of elements of the individual loops , during which they move undergo the stretching or shrinking .",
    "other reasons for change of quantity @xmath37 are the random reconnection processes .",
    "we discriminate two types of processes , namely the fusion of two loops into the larger single loop and the breakdown of a single loop into two daughter loops ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite.the kinetics of the vortex tangle are affected by the intensity of the introduced processes , which is number of events per unit volume and unit time .",
    "the intensity of the first process is characterized by the coefficient @xmath12 , which is the rate of collision of two loops with lengths @xmath7and @xmath8 and forming the loop of length @xmath9 .",
    "the intensity of the second process is characterized by the coefficient @xmath6 , which is the rate of self - intersection and breaking down of a loop with length @xmath0 into two daughter loops with lengths @xmath10 and @xmath8 . in view of",
    "what has been exposed above we can directly write out the master kinetic  equation for rate of change of the distribution function @xmath37 @xmath40all of the processes are depicted at the left of each line . in spite of very cumbersome form , equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) is quite transparent .",
    "indeed , let us take for instance the sixth line .",
    "it asserts that number of loops of length @xmath0 increases whenever a loop with length @xmath7 breaks down into two smaller loops and one of the daughter loops has the length @xmath0 .",
    "rate of growth is proportional to number of larger loops @xmath41 and to the intensity of breakdown @xmath42 .",
    "then we have to integrate over all sizes @xmath7 .",
    "delta function @xmath43 just controls conservation of the total length while recombination .",
    "we do not consider here possible small loss of length due to reconnection , this question in context of our approach had been studied in @xcite .",
    "kinetic  equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) has a book - keeping  character , moreover , in this form it is applicable for other systems e.g. , for network of cosmic strings .",
    "physics of this approach lies in the correctdeterminations of coefficient @xmath12 and @xmath6 of this equation on the base of some more or less plausible model . in next subsections",
    "we will outline main idea and derive mathematical identities for the rates coefficient @xmath12 and @xmath6 ) in the case of an arbitrary network of loops .",
    "detailed calculation of these quantities for vortex loops in the turbulent superfluid helium on the gaussian model is performed in appendix b.      in this subsection we formulate mathematical definition for quantities @xmath45 and@xmath46  @xmath6 .",
    "we start with the quantity @xmath44 by definition its physical meaning is the frequency of events when part of line with total length @xmath0 intersects itself and breaks down into two daughter loops with lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "as it was already stated we assume that each crossing event leads to the reconnection of lines .",
    "let us consider function @xmath47which is the vector connecting points @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    , where the label variable @xmath50 is taken here as the arc length .",
    "we associate the moment of intersection with the vanishing of vector @xmath51 connecting points @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the rate coefficient of break - down is equal to number of zeroes of function @xmath54 in space of its variables @xmath55,width=264 ]    clearly , the condition @xmath56 implies that the self - crossing event of parts of the line with label - coordinates @xmath57 occurs at moment of time @xmath58 .",
    "the quantity @xmath59 is fluctuating 3-component function of three arguments @xmath60 .",
    "we are interested in how often @xmath59 vanishes in cube of space @xmath61 . from theory of generalized function",
    "it follows that number of these points ( we denote them below as @xmath62 ) can be expressed via @xmath63-function of quantity @xmath64 with the help of the following formula .",
    "@xmath65here @xmath66 are the components of vector @xmath67 . by integration of both parts of ( [ s_zeroes_number ] ) over @xmath68",
    "we obtain the full number of intersections ( per unit time ) .",
    "the lengths of pieces of the self - intersecting line are however arbitrary .",
    "the requirement that pieces should have lengths @xmath7 and @xmath69 can be satisfied by the introducing additional constraint @xmath70into integrand .",
    "in addition we have to do averaging over all possible fluctuating configurations .",
    "finally the coefficient @xmath71 with dimension @xmath72 = s^{-1}cm^{-1}$ ] is @xmath73    to obtain coefficient @xmath12 we use the similar procedure .",
    "let us consider two loops with length @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "our purpose now to find the rate @xmath12 of fusion of these two loops into one loop of length @xmath74 .",
    "dimension of @xmath12 is @xmath75=cm^{3}s^{-1}$ ] . as previously",
    ", we describe vortex filaments by positions of radius vectors their elements @xmath76 and @xmath77 . here",
    "we have the two label variables @xmath78 belonging to different loops and running in the limits @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "one more important difference with the previous case is that both functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 should depend on initial  positions @xmath83 and @xmath84 , chosen arbitrary . of course in previous case of the self - intersection of single loop ,",
    "quantity @xmath85 also depended on initial  positions , but it did not influence the rate of self - intersection . for case of the fusion",
    "this dependance is important , since very distant loops have the small probability to collide .",
    "let us introduce the fusion  functions @xmath86repeating the considerations for case of the single loop we find that the number of reconnection ( per unit of time ) of points @xmath87 formally coincides with ( [ s_zeroes_number ] ) @xmath88with the difference that @xmath87 belong to different curves .",
    "since intersections of any elements of lines lead to the fusion of loops we have to integrate ( [ m_zeroes_number ] ) over @xmath89 .",
    "the result obtained is valid for chosen pair of loops . to obtain the total number of events we have to multiply the result obtained by quantity @xmath90 , which is the full number of loops of chosen sizes in the whole volume . comparing with the master kinetic equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) we find the final expression for fusion coefficient @xmath12    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the total volume of system .",
    "thus we obtained expressions for the coefficients ( [ b_def])and ( a_def ) , which allow to calculate the rates of the fusion and breakdown of the vortex loops .",
    "they are , however , just formal mathematical identities .",
    "concrete results depend on statistics and dynamics of individual lines . therefore to move further we have to ascertain the procedure for averaging .",
    "we will do it with use of the so - called gaussian model of vortex loops , which is bases on the presentation them as having a random walk structure . in order not to overcharge the main text we will expose both ideas of gaussian model and detailed evaluation of quantities @xmath93 and @xmath94 in appendices a and b.",
    "in this section we describe one particular but very important solution to the rate equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) . following  results exposed in appendices",
    "we adopt the following expressions for coefficient @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( see relations ( [ b_final]),([a_final ] ) in appendix b ) .",
    "@xmath97quantity @xmath98 @xmath99 is ( @xmath0-independent ) characteristic velocity of approaching of elements of line ,  @xmath100 and @xmath101 are numerical constants . the quantity @xmath35 associated with the mean radius of the curvature(see @xcite and appendix a ) , and it is a low cut - off of the whole approach .",
    "early the equation similar to ( [ kinetic equation ] ) with coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( [ a_and_b ] ) had been studied analytically in papers copeland98 , and numerically in @xcite .",
    "thus , in particular in copeland98 it was demonstrated that ( [ kinetic equation ] ) has the asymptotic solution @xmath102 , which describes thermodynamics equilibrium .",
    "it had been obtained in supposition of detailed balance , which implies that each of the line in the collision integral vanishes .",
    "this solution , however , is an approximate solution of the rate equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) valid only in case of very small daughter loop .    here we will search for stationary solution of ( [ kinetic equation ] ) neglecting deterministic terms . as it had been discussed in the introduction ,",
    "processes of recombination ( fusion and splitting ) are the fastest , so it is quite natural to suppose that the collision term @xmath103 expressed by the lines 2 - 7  in ( [ kinetic equation ] ) is the leading one .",
    "we assume that the time independent solution of the equation @xmath104 is the basic equation , and nonstationary processes as well as processes related to the deterministic motion can be accounted in the frame of the perturbation theory . therefore , as a first step we neglect other terms and concentrate on seeking for solution @xmath105 .",
    "coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath106 are the power low functions , therefore they are scale invariant quantities@xmath28that implies that for the scales exceeding @xmath35 there is no characteristic length in the statement of problem .",
    "it points out that equation @xmath105 should have the scale invariant , or power - like solution of form @xmath107 . to find power - like solution we use the zakharov ansatz , which  is the special treatment of the collisionintegral in equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) .",
    "this trick was elaborated by zakharov for the wave turbulence ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , now we will show how it works in our case .",
    "let us take for instance the first and second integrals in the collision termof ( [ kinetic equation ] ) .",
    "let us further perform in the second integral the following change of variables .",
    "@xmath108under this change of variables various factors in the integrand of the second integral transforms as follows @xmath109@xmath110@xmath111as result the second integral in the collision  term takes a form ( the additional term @xmath112 in the power counting appears from the jacobian of transformation ) @xmath113it is easy to see that the transformed second term  in the collision  integral in the right hand side of the master kinetic equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) turns into first integral with an additional factor @xmath114 in the integrand .",
    "performing the same procedure for all lines we conclude that the collision integralof the rate equation  can be written as @xmath115for @xmath116 both expressions @xmath117 and @xmath118 are equal to @xmath119 .",
    "thus the integrands of both integrals in ( [ kin_power ] ) include expressions of type @xmath120 and these integrals vanish .",
    "this implies in stationary case and neglecting the deterministic terms in ( [ kinetic equation ] ) the power - like solution @xmath121 for distribution function @xmath37 of density of loop in space  of their lengths takes place .",
    "let us discuss the physical meaning of the solution obtained .",
    "first of all we stress that it is not related to detailed balance i.e. it does not describe thermal equilibrium , it rather corresponds to the nonequilibrium state . to clarify the nature of this nonequilibrium state we introduce the length density @xmath122 ( in space of sizes @xmath0 ) , which the full length accumulated in loops of size @xmath0 ( per unit of volume ) @xcite @xmath123the total length ( per unit volume ) , or the vortex line density @xmath3 is defined as follows :",
    "@xmath124quantity @xmath125 is obviously conserved during the reconnections events @xmath126 ( see , however , remark in section ii and paper @xcite ) .",
    "conservation of the vortex line density can be expressed in the form of continuity equation for the length density @xmath127 @xmath128this form of equation states that the rate of change of length is associated with flux  of length in space of sizes of the loops .",
    "term flux  here means just the redistribution of length ( or energy , see @xcite ) among the loops of different sizes due to reconnections .",
    "expression for @xmath129 is obtained by multiplying the rate equation [ kinetic equation]by @xmath0 and by rewriting the collisionterm in the shape of a derivative with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "the result is ( substitutions @xmath130 and @xmath131  have been used below)@xmath132both integrals in relation ( [ flux_integral ] ) coincide with integrals in ( [ kin_power ] ) , therefore they vanish for @xmath133 .",
    "however they have preintegral factors with the denominators , which also vanish for @xmath133 and we have the indeterminacy @xmath134 . calculating numerically integrals in ( [ flux_integral ] ) as functions of @xmath135  and taking @xmath136 we obtain the final expressions for the flux  of length in space of sizes of the loops @xmath137the positive sign of the first term corresponds to the flux of length in the direction of large scales .",
    "this is justified , since the fusion processes lead to formation of larger and larger loops .",
    "the negative sign of the second term corresponds to the flux of length in the direction of small scales .",
    "this is justified , since the breaking down processes lead to formation of smaller and smaller loops .",
    "schematically this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "we will also use terms `` direct cascade '' describing cascade like breakdown of loops and `` inverse cascade '' responsible for formation of larger and larger loops . as it had been discussed in introduction",
    "the direct cascade of consequent breaking down of vortex loops was predicted by feynman in his pioneering paper @xcite .",
    "the feynman s idea was confirmed in various numerical calculations , where the procedure of artificial elimination of small loops had been used @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our analytical calculations confirmed the splendid feynman s conjecture and give an exact evaluation for the cascade - like flux ( the second term in the right hand side of relation ( [ flux ] ) ) .",
    "in addition we obtained result about inverse cascade responsible for formation of larger and larger loops , so the direction of the net flux is not clear . in more details",
    "this fact will be discussed in the next section .",
    "thus we have found stationary power - solution to the rate equation ( kinetic equation ) neglecting deterministic terms .",
    "as  it was already mentioned this solution connected with recombination of loops describes the fastest processes  and can be considered as a first iteration for the whole problem stated by master `` rate equation '' ( [ kinetic equation ] ) .",
    "the approach elaborated above allows to draw several conclusions concerning both the structure and dynamics of the real vortex tangle in the turbulent he ii .",
    "it will be done in the following section .",
    "in this subsection we discuss some properties of the vortex tangle resulting from the solution of equation @xmath105 obtained and analyzed in the previous section .",
    "as mentioned this solution is a stationary solution of the master kinetic equation ( [ kinetic equation ] ) neglecting deterministic terms .",
    "the latter implies that the interaction with normal component is omitted hence the title of this subsection .    to use formulas derived in previous section we have to specify quantity @xmath138 , which enters into the rates coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 of both the merging and breaking down processes .",
    "basing on the results obtained in appendix b we estimate the velocity factor @xmath98 to be of the order of @xmath139  ( @xmath140 is the quantum of circulation ) .",
    "thus the only parameters of the whole theory ( at zero temperature ) are the quantum of circulation @xmath140  and the mean radius of curvature @xmath35 .      because of a huge amount of reconnections each of the terms in the right hand side of relation for the net flux ( [ flux ] ) are large . the net flux @xmath141 , which is the difference between positive @xmath142 and negative @xmath143 constituents is much smaller .",
    "neglecting @xmath141 and equating @xmath142 and @xmath143 we are in position to ascertain constant @xmath144 @xmath145    new numerical parameter @xmath146 @xmath147 . thus the power - like solution @xmath1 of the master `` rate equation '' ( [ kinetic equation ] ) is @xmath148the total length  @xmath14 per unit of volume is evaluated as follows ( we recall that quantity @xmath35 serves as the low cut - off ):",
    "@xmath149    result ( [ vld_vs_curvature ] ) is remarkable .",
    "it asserts that interline space @xmath150 is of the order of the mean radius of curvature @xmath35 , namely @xmath151        this idea had been launched by schwarz @xcite , it is illustrated in fig .",
    "the nature of this phenomenon was not clear .",
    "we proved that this relation appears due to kinetics of colliding vortex loops . in more realistic situation of nonzero temperature connection between interline space the mean radius of curvature @xmath35",
    "had been obtain numerically by schwarz .",
    "@xcite @xmath152the temperature dependent parameter @xmath153 is one of the structure constant of the voretx tangle introduced by schwarz .",
    "it is responsible for kinking of the vortex filaments .",
    "function @xmath153 decreases when the temperature grows , this imply that the vortex tangle becomes more kinked at low temperatures .",
    "this fact had been reported in numerical works ( see e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) . comparing ( [ schwarz_number ] )  and",
    "( [ curvature_vs_interline ] ) we conclude that parameter @xmath154 , obtained in our approach is the zero - temperature limit of quantay @xmath155for the minimal temperature @xmath156 covered in the schwarz s simulations the latter quantity is approximately @xmath157 .",
    "note that this value is very close to @xmath146 @xmath147 , obtained for the zero temperature case .",
    "in previous subsection we had ascertained the constant @xmath144 in relation @xmath107 ( see ( [ n_final ] ) ) and found the connection between the vortex line density @xmath14 with mean curvature @xmath35 ( see ( [ vld_vs_curvature ] ) ) .",
    "this enables us to express the net flux @xmath158 ( [ flux ] ) via quantity @xmath14 . substituting ( vld_vs_curvature ) into relation for the net flux ( [ flux ] ) we arrive at conclusion that both the positive constituent @xmath142 and the negative one @xmath159 are proportional to the squared vortex line density @xmath160 in unsteady case at finite temperature quantities @xmath142 and @xmath143 do not compensate each other , so the net flux @xmath141 does not vanish and it is also proportional to the squared vortex line density @xmath160 that means that the rate of decay of quantity @xmath125 due to fluxes carrying away the length from the system can be written as @xmath161relation ( [ ve ] ) is the particular case of the so - called vinen equation discussed in detail in the next subsection .",

    "b ) in @xmath168space .",
    "we use the absolute value of @xmath169 because the net flux  @xmath141 always carries away the vortex line density @xmath14  from the system , and different signs refer to direction of the cascade .",
    "let us treat the deterministic term in equation ( [ ve_0 ] ) .",
    "we calculate the rate of a change in the length of each loop on the base of the motion equation of  the line in the so - called local approximation ( see e.g. , schwarz88 ) . in this approach",
    "the velocity of the line element @xmath170 is @xmath171here @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the first and second derivatives from position of line @xmath174 with respect to label variable @xmath175 , which coincides here with the arc length .",

    "the approach elaborated here quantitatively confirmed feynman s splendid conjecture .",

    "let us discuss the meaning of various terms entering this equation .",
    "the first , generating term in the right hand side of the vinen equation describes the grows of the vortex tangle due to the mutual friction .",
    "the second term is also connected to the mutual friction , however this term is responsible for a decrease of the vortex line density .",
    "this point of view coincides with ideas by schwarz @xcite who obtained the deterministic contribution into @xmath203 using a bit different approach .",
    "the third term in the right hand side of ( [ vinen ] ) is related to the random collisions of vortex loops .",
    "it describes a decrease of the vortex line density due to the flux of length carrying away the length from the system . depending on an interplay between coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath206 and the schwarz parameters @xmath153",
    "the flux can be either positive or negative .",
    "we stress again that independently on the sign of the net flux , this third term should result in a decrease of the vortex line density .",
    "the negative flux appears when the break down of loops prevails and the cascade - like process of generation of smaller and smaller loops forms .",
    "there exists a number of mechanisms of disappearance of the vortex energy on very small scales",
    ". it can be e.g. , the acoustic radiation , collapse of lines , kelvin waves etc .",
    "these dissipative mechanisms balance the grow of the line length due to the mutual friction . as a result , fully developed turbulence with the flux of energy in direction of small scales",
    "is formed , what implies highly chaotic picture of the vortex tangle ( see fig .",
    "7 ) .",
    "the case with inverse is less clear .",
    "the inverse cascade implies the cascade - like process of generation of larger and larger loops . unlike the previous case of the direct cascade",
    ", there is no an apparent mechanism for disappearance of very large loops .",
    "the probable scenario is that the parts of large loops are pinned to the walls . finally , a state with few lines stretching from wall to wall with poor dynamics and rare events is realized , this is a degenerated state of the vortex tangle ( see fig . 8) .",
    "some of numerical investigators@xcite , @xcite , report on this situation .",
    "this observation can be an alternative explanation for a phenomenon discovered in helsinki group@xcite , who observed transition to superfluid turbulence governed by the temperature .",
    "the evolution of a network of vortex loops in he ii , which merge and break down due to reconnections has been considered .",
    "it was discussed that because of very frequent reconnections of the vortex loops these processes of recombination is the leading mechanism in the whole dynamics of the vortex tangle . to develop the quantitative description we take the vortex loops to have a brownian structure with the only degree  of freedom , which is length @xmath0 of the loop .",
    "we perform investigation on the basis of the boltzmann type kinetic equation  for distribution function @xmath1 of number of loops with lengths @xmath207 by the use of special substitution of variables in the collision integral ( zakharov ansatz ) we had found the power - like stationary solution to this equation .",
    "this is a non - equilibrium solution characterized by two mutual fluxes of length ( energy ) in the space of loop sizes .",
    "the negative flux ( direct cascade ) corresponds to the cascade - like breaking down the vortex loops with consequent dissipation of energy on a very small scale",
    ". this situation fully coincides with the scenario of superfluid turbulence proposed by feynmanfeynman .",
    "the positive flux ( inverse cascade ) corresponds to the cascade - like formation of larger and larger loops . analyzing this solution we drew several results on the structure and dynamics of the vortex tangle in the superfluid turbulent helium .",
    "in particular , we obtained that the mean radius of the curvature is of the order of the interline space .",
    "we also evaluated the full rate of reconnection events .",
    "assuming , further , that processes of random colliding are the fastest we studied evolution of  the vortex line density @xmath125 in a presence of mutual friction ( for finite temperatures ) . this evolution was shown to obey the famous vinen equation . in conclusion",
    "we discuss the properties of the vinen equation from the point of view of the developed approach .",
    "thus , depending on the temperature ( and independently on velocity ) vortices either develop into a highly chaotic picture ( turbulence ) , or degenerate into few smooth lines .",

    "<S> we also evaluated the full rate of the reconnection events . assuming , further , that the processes of random collisions are the fastest ones , we studied the evolution of full length of vortex loops per unit volume - the so - called vortex line density @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown this evolution to obey the famous vinen equation . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the vinen equation from the point of view of the developed approach had been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , depending on the temperature ( and independently on velocity ) vortices either develop into the highly chaotic turbulent state ( low temperature ) , or degenerate into few smooth lines ( high temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> this observation can be an alternative explanation for the phenomenon discovered in helsinki group ( nature 424 , 10221025 ( 2003)).pacs - numbers : 67.25.dk , 47.37.+q , 05.20.-y </S>"
