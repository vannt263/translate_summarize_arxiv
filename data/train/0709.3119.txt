    "luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs : l(8 - 1000@xmath0)@xmath12 10@xmath13 l@xmath9 ; @xcite ) have been studied extensively in the local universe with the infrared astronomical telescope ( iras ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the infrared space observatory ( iso ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and more recently , with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) on @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies exhibit a large range of properties in the mid - ir , some showing strong pah emission features characteristic of powerful ( up to @xmath141000 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 ) star formation rates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and all exhibiting a large range in 9.7@xmath15 silicate absorption or emission strengths ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath1 irs is now enabling the study of the mid - infrared spectra of lirgs to much higher redshifts ( @xmath162.6 ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "although rare locally , lirgs become an important population at high redshifts and account for an increasing fraction of the star - formation activity in the universe @xcite . by studying their infrared properties , one can estimate the extent to which agn and star - formation contribute to their infrared luminosities , and therefore determine a correct census of starbursts and agn at epochs in the universe when their luminosity density was at its maximum .",
    "a particularly interesting population of high redshift optically faint infrared sources has been discovered using the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; @xcite ) .",
    "various observing programs with @xmath1 irs have found that mips sources at flux density levels of f@xmath5(24@xmath0 ) @xmath17 1 mjy with optical magnitudes @xmath18 @xmath19 24 vega magnitudes are typically at z @xmath17 2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of the sources are characterized by strong absorption by the 9.7@xmath0 silicate feature , but sources chosen with an additional indicator of star formation ( sub - mm detection or shape of the spectral energy distribution ) often shown strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . using traditional optical techniques to characterize these sources is difficult because they are too faint in the optical band .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy is the best currently available tool in understanding these sources but we need to learn how to categorize them from the different features that are exhibited in the infrared band",
    ". we might expect sources which are selected on the basis of their large far - infrared flux densities to contain large amounts of cool dust and show signatures of starbursts .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy of these sources will test this assumption and may help our understanding of high redshift lirgs as a whole .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the first _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectra of a small sample of galaxies selected on the basis of their large 70@xmath0 flux densities and optical faintness .",
    "we have previously reported results on sources chosen only with criteria of large infrared to optical flux ratios , as measured by comparison of their 24 @xmath0 flux density , f@xmath5(24@xmath0 ) with optical magnitude ( @xmath18-[24]>14 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we now extend the irs observations to additional sources in botes that are less extreme in their @xmath18-[24 ] colors but are selected with the additional criteria of detection at 70@xmath6 m by @xmath1 mips .",
    "a cosmology of @xmath20 , @xmath21=0.3 , and @xmath22=0.7 is assumed throughout .",
    "we selected a sample of optically faint far - infrared luminous sources from the _ spitzer _ mips 70@xmath0 survey of the noao deep wide - field ( ndwfs ; @xcite ) botes field for follow - up with @xmath1 irs .",
    "such sources have not previously been studied and our paper provides the first census of their basic mid - ir properties .",
    "the 70@xmath0 observations reach a 5@xmath23 limiting flux density of f@xmath24=25 mjy , and yield a total of @xmath14 330 sources . to insure a highly reliable 70@xmath0 catalog , and allow follow - up observations with irs",
    ", we only included 70@xmath0 sources with a 24@xmath0 flux density , f@xmath251 mjy and f@xmath2630 mjy ( this resulted in only 16 rejected sources and should not bias our sample to sources with unusually high 24@xmath0 flux densities ) .",
    "we measured optical photometry in the publicly available ndwfs @xmath18-band images , and selected all sources with @xmath2720  vega mag .",
    "although ideally , we would like to select sources as red in their optical to infrared colors as the @xmath28[24]@xmath1214 sources previously observed in the botes field , the lack of available candidates has required us to relax this criteria .",
    "our sample have a larger range of optical to infrared colors corresponding to 11@xmath29-[24]@xmath1116.5 .",
    "although the optical obscuration is likely to be less extreme , the combined faint optical and bright infrared selection should still select distant infrared bright galaxies .",
    "the basic optical and infrared properties of the 11 sources are presented in table  [ tab:70sample ] .",

    "figure  [ fig : l6 ] shows that the absorption - dominated sources have observed - frame @xmath4f@xmath5(70@xmath6m)/@xmath4f@xmath5(24@xmath6 m ) flux density ratios that are smaller than the pah - dominated sources and closer to that of the x - ray selected agn presented in brand et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , suggesting that they have shallower infrared spectral slopes indicative of agn - dominated sources .",
    "we note that one must be cautious in interpreting these results since the flux densities are in the observed frame and the rest - frame flux density ratio may vary with redshift .",
    "although we can directly measure rest - frame flux density ratios at shorter wavelengths , these wavelengths are more likely to be affected by absorption .",
    "the f@xmath5(15@xmath6m)/f@xmath5(6@xmath6 m ) flux density ratios of absorption - dominated sources are generally larger than that of the pah - dominated sources .",
    "we suggest that strong dust absorption in the absorption - dominated sources results in a steeper infrared slope at these shorter infrared wavelengths , despite the fact that they have small @xmath4f@xmath5(70@xmath6m)/@xmath4f@xmath5(24@xmath6 m ) flux density ratios and are likely to be dominated by agn .",
    "we conclude that these are examples of very obscured sources , which are likely to be powered by agn .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility of them being powered by deeply embedded starbursts .",
    "if the mid - ir emission of these sources is dominated by agn , this implies that @xmath1436% of sources selected to have luminous 70 @xmath0 emission are agn - dominated .",
    "perhaps the 70 @xmath0 emission , which traces cooler dust , is also powered largely by agn ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in this cases ,",
    "large 70 @xmath0 luminosities be generated because the agn are so heavily absorbed by dust that a large fraction of the hot dust emission is absorbed and re - emitted at longer wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , if a large fraction of the mid - ir emission originates from star - formation activity , this implies that star - formation activity as traced by mid - ir signatures can be hidden by obscuration and/or low level agn activity .",
    "follow - up multi - wavelength observations ( optical spectroscopy , deep x - ray and radio imaging ) are clearly needed to fully determine the nature of these rare sources .",
    "to help provide further insight as to the nature of the pah - dominated and absorption - dominated sources , we show the irac color - color diagram for our irs sources in figure  [ fig : irac]a .",
    "for both the pah - dominated and absorption - dominated sources , the colors are consistent with the expected positions of starburst - dominated relatively low redshift galaxies ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although we have concluded in previous sections that the absorption - dominated sources are probably largely powered by agn emission , they do not fall into the `` agn wedge '' of @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to very heavy obscuration of the agn .",
