    "the depth of the potential well is about 0.5 ev . the @xmath5 state not only is metastable regarding radiative emission , but it is also metastable with respect to predissociation .",
    "the latter arises because the minimum in the potential curve for the @xmath5 state lies about 1.50 ev above its diabatic limit , c[@xmath46d ] @xmath13 c[@xmath46d ] .",
    "the @xmath5 state is somewhat unique since the same potential curve undergoes two very different predissociation mechanisms before and after the minimum .",

    "( 1995 ) , kaczmarczyk ( 2000 ) , sonnentrucker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and us involves triplet - singlet interactions , via spin - orbit mixing , and an avoided crossing . according to bruna & grein ( 2001 ) , the curves for 2 and 3 @xmath8 are essentially repulsive .",
    "the inner portion of the 3 @xmath8 curve constitutes the triplet counterpart of @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "there exists an avoided crossing between the curves for 2 and 3 @xmath8 at approximately 9.2 ev near 2.4 bohr that may affect the @xmath5 @xmath6 potential . beyond the avoided crossing ,",
    "the curve for 3 @xmath8 lies close to that for @xmath5 @xmath6 for a short interval .",
    "portions of the potential curves for 4 and 5 @xmath8 are also located nearby ( around 9.5 ev and internuclear separation of about 2.6 bohr ) .",
    "both curves have potential wells ; bruna & grein ( 2001 ) , however , do not list possible vibrational levels for 4 and 5 @xmath8 .",
    "if they existed , triplet - singlet mixing may arise , but the line broadening seen by us suggests predissociation is taking place and that would require another avoided crossing with a repulsive curve .",
    "tunneling through the potential barrier created by avoided crossings among @xmath6 states and spin - orbit mixing between @xmath5 @xmath6 and other close - lying triplet states of @xmath9 symmetry could also lead to the perturbations seen in interstellar spectra ( p. bruna , private communication ) , but are less likely .",
    "tunneling is expected to affect the @xmath29 @xmath11 2 level the most because it lies near the top of the barrier ; such an effect may explain why lines from this level are not seen in laboratory ( herzberg et al .",
    "1969 ) or interstellar spectra .",
    "the spin - orbit mixing considered here involves repulsive states that can predissociate the @xmath5 state .",
    "we consider the results of ci calculations by kirby & liu ( 1979 ) .",
    "their table vi lists weakly bound states that may be of relevance here .",
    "two states , 2 @xmath47 and 1 @xmath48 , may perturb the @xmath5 state in a significant way .",

    "( 1977 ) pointed out that such interactions are relatively weak , since two electrons are excited .      since the results on c@xmath0 based on the @xmath17 band toward the stars",

    "1994 ; lambert et al . 1995",
    "; sheffer et al . 2008 ) and others in the past ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1986 ; kaczmarczyk 2000 ; sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2007 ) , here we focus on the new determinations .",
    "we consider predictions for the c@xmath0 column density inferred from observed columns of ch and cn , based on a simple prescription discussed by us earlier ( e.g. , federman et al .",
    "1994 ; knauth et al .",
    "in particular , we compare the predictions in pan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and sheffer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with the c@xmath0 measurements from the present work .",
    "furthermore , the rotational state distribution in terms of column densities yields information about the excitation of the molecule , from which gas density and temperature and the strength of the infrared radiation field permeating the gas can be inferred ( van dishoeck & black 1982 ) .",
    "more recent data indicate refinements to the analysis of c@xmath0 excitation compared to our earlier studies .",
    "first , experiments ( erman & iwamae 1995 ) and theoretical calculations ( kokkin et al . 2007 ; schmidt & bacskay 2007 ) are converging on a @xmath19-value for the @xmath15 ( 2,0 ) transition larger than we used in the past .",
    "a value of @xmath51 now seems more appropriate , rather than @xmath52 used by us in the past .",
    "second , the cross section for excitation via collisions is larger than the value suggested by van dischoek & black ( 1982 ) . more recent quantum mechanical calculations ( lavendy et al .",
    "1991 ; robbe et al . 1992 ; najar et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) indicate a cross section of @xmath53 @xmath54 , rather than @xmath55 @xmath54 .",
    "the two changes would partially cancel , yielding @xmath10 about 60% smaller than what we would have obtained with the older values .",
    "however , a more sophisticated treatment based on the latest information and considering core - halo clouds ( casu & cecchi - pestellini 2012 ) suggests that our original method provides a reasonable approximation .",
    "this arises when a weighted density is obtained for the core and halo portions of the clouds seen toward @xmath18 oph , which we also studied ( lambert et al .",
    "we , therefore , present results using our earlier method with the realization of their approximate nature . to extract @xmath14 from @xmath10",
    ", we continue to assume there is no enhancement in the infrared flux over the average interstellar value and we multiply @xmath10 by 1.5 .",
    "this accounts for the fact that diffuse molecular clouds have roughly equal amounts of atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "table 3 provides comparisons of measured and predicted c@xmath0 column density , predicted gas densities from cn chemistry and c@xmath0 excitation , and the gas temperature derived from h@xmath0 , @xmath56(h@xmath0 ) , and the c@xmath0 excitation temperature , @xmath57(c@xmath0 ) , the latter based on all observed column densities .",
    "our column densities appearing in the second column are obtained from the detections shown in table 2 ; if contributions from higher - lying levels were included , @xmath58(c@xmath0 ) would be about 0.1 dex higher . in the column for gas densities from analysis of the cn chemistry ,",
    "several entries may appear , depending on the number of molecular components detected for that sight line .",
    "the c@xmath0 column densities predicted by the simple cn chemical model agree very well with our new determinations . for hd  206267 , hd  207308 , and hd  208266",
    ", the comparison is best when only the main molecular component is considered .",
    "this is not surprising ; although the complete component structure is used to fit the spectra , the other components are masked in the noise because the @xmath7 ( 1,0 ) band is relatively weak . for hd  206267 , we also note that the column density inferred from the @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) , @xmath15 ( 2,0 ) , and @xmath15 ( 3,0 ) bands by sonnentrucker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is in excellent agreement with our result .",
    "the gas densities derived from the cn chemistry and c@xmath0 excitation do not appear to agree very well .",
    "the expected agreement is a factor of 2 ( e.g. , federman et al .",
    "1994 ) , but the densities from excitation are generally lower . a possible cause for the discrepancy may involve the presence of multiple , lower density molecular components along the line of sight .",
    "modeling the spectra may favor the dominant component in terms of column density , but the distribution of rotational levels may depend on all the components .",
    "further evidence for this possibility is found in the comparison between @xmath56(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath57(c@xmath0 ) . except for the gas toward hd  192035 , which has the highest density from c@xmath0 excitation in our sample , the two temperatures are comparable . earlier studies of molecular rich diffuse clouds ( see e.g. , sheffer et al . 2007 ) showed that on average @xmath57(c@xmath0 ) was less than @xmath56(h@xmath0 ) . the lower density , higher temperature components appear to play a more significant role in the determination of c@xmath0 excitation .",
    "this idea is supported by the more thorough analyses of casu & cecchi - pestellini ( 2012 ) .",
    "we also mention that the excitation analysis for the gas toward hd  198781 is not very satisfying . minimizing the differences between the observable distribution and the predicted ones could not provide restrictions on @xmath57(c@xmath0 ) .",
    "this probably arose because absorption from only @xmath27 @xmath11 4 and 6 was detected .",
    "we described a study of interstellar c@xmath0 based on archival @xmath20 spectra of the @xmath17 ( 0,0 ) , @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) , and @xmath7 ( 1,0 ) bands .",
    "building on earlier work , we provided further details regarding the anomalies in line strengths seen in the @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) band .",
    "line shifts were quantified for transitions involving @xmath35 @xmath59 .",
    "the lines for both @xmath7 bands were found to be broadened by predissociation .",
    "the anomalies likely arise from triplet - singlet interactions involving spin - orbit mixing between the @xmath5 @xmath60 state and @xmath8 states combined with an avoided crossing between the triplet states .",
    "other possibilities include tunneling through a potential barrier , which is caused by avoided crossings with the 3 and 4 @xmath60 states , and spin - orbit mixing between the @xmath5 state and other triplet states of @xmath9 symmetry , but these are not as likely .",
    "we also determined new c@xmath0 column densities from the @xmath7 ( 1,0 ) band and compared these results with our earlier predictions , finding very good agreement .",
    "our analysis of c@xmath0 excitation yields somewhat lower gas densities , but these are consistent with core - halo models using a refined set of input parameters ( casu & cecchi - pestellini 2012 ) .",
    "the inferred gas densities are still consistent with chemical predictions , when the presence of complex component structure along the line of sight having a range of gas densities is considered .",
    "we conclude by noting possible extensions of this work .",
    "first , additional theoretical calculations and experiments are needed to elucidate more clearly the cause of the anomalies present in @xmath7 spectra .",
    "second , because empirical and theoretical oscillator strengths for the three band systems used in interstellar studies ( @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath7 ) have achieved an impressive level of concensus , interstellar c@xmath0 abundances are now more secure .",
    "abundances can be determined from any of the bands , but analyses should not rely solely on the @xmath7 ( 0,0 ) band , where anomalies in line strength are the strongest .",
    "future studies using the @xmath7 bands should also incorporate the broadening caused by predissociation when modeling the spectra .",
    "this is especially important for studies of sight lines where the transition from diffuse molecular to dark clouds is taking place .",
    "the abundances are sufficiently large that optical depth effects need to be considered .",
