    "the wind is of the order of 10@xmath10  , which is about an order of magnitude higher than the typical values measured for the nearby seyfert sources .    if indeed uhv outflows are common to bright quasars , this could have far reaching implications on our understanding of agn winds and agns in general .",
    "for instance , if these winds carry a significant amount of mass as the high column densities may suggest , they would alter our estimates of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium by quasars .",
    "it remains to be shown theoretically what mechanism ( e.g. , radiation pressure ) can drive these intense winds .",
    "since the amount of mass in the wind is not well constrained , it is still unclear what effect it may have on the energy budget of the agn .",

    "( 2003a , 2005 ) except for a few minor features which appear to be slightly different between the two reductions .",

    "25 kev energy range with a simple power law .",
    "the best fitted power law has a photon index of @xmath11 and a normalization of @xmath12 ph@xmath13s@xmath0kev@xmath0 and gives @xmath14 for 487 degrees - of - freedom ( d.o.f . ) . extrapolating this power law up to a rest - frame energy of 11  kev",

    "fitting for all parameters simultaneously , we find the best - fit gaussian line center is at @xmath15  kev ( or @xmath16  kev in the rest frame ) and a line width ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath18  kev . the total flux in the line is @xmath19 ^-2s^-1 ph@xmath13s@xmath0 . for the edge",

    "we stress that this edge does not necessarily contradict the presence of the line detected by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a , 2005 ) , since k@xmath8 edges have lines right next to them .",

    "( 2003a , 2005 ) to be from s and mg , only we identify them as different lines at much lower velocities .",
    "the 2.68 kev line is identified here as sxvhe@xmath24 and the 1.47 kev line is identified as mgxihe@xmath24 .",
    "the rgs1 and rgs2 were operated in the standard spectroscopy mode resulting in an exposure time of @xmath25 ks .",
    "the spectra were extracted into uniform bins of @xmath70.04   ( which is about the rgs resolution and is 4 times the default bin width ) in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . for the purpose of modeling narrow absorption lines",
    ", this rebinning method is better than the method used by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) of rebinning the spectrum to a minimum of 20 counts per bin , which distorts the spectrum especially around low - count - rate absorption troughs .",
    "to flux calibrate the rgs spectra we divided the count spectrum of each instrument by its exposure time and its effective area at each wavelength .",
    "each flux - calibrated spectrum was corrected for galactic absorption and the two spectra were combined into an error - weighted mean . at wavelengths where the rgs2 bins did not match exactly the wavelength of the rgs1 bins , we interpolated the rgs2 data to enable the averaging .",
    "the sky - subtracted combined rgs spectrum has in total @xmath26 counts and its s / n ranges from @xmath27 around 8  to @xmath28 around 18  with an average of 3 .",

    "the present method is an ion - by - ion fit to the data similar to the approach used in sako et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and in behar et  al .",
    "we first use the continuum measured from the epic - pn data , but renormalized to the rgs flux level .",
    "this continuum is then absorbed using the full set of lines for each individual ion .",
    "our absorption model includes the first 10 resonance lines of h- and he- like ions of c , n , o , ne , and mg as well as edges for these ions .",
    "the model also includes our own calculation for the l - shell absorption lines of fe ( behar et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as of si , s , and ar corrected according to laboratory measurements ( lepson et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "finally , we include inner - shell k@xmath8 absorption lines of o and mg ( behar & netzer 2002 ) , which we detect in the spectrum .",
    "the absorbed spectrum is complemented by the emission lines mentioned above , which are observed in the rgs spectrum .    by experimenting with the absorption line parameters , we find that the observed lines are all blueshifted by about 3000  ^-1 kms@xmath0  with an uncertainty of 500  ^-1 kms@xmath0 . in the model we used a turbulence velocity of 1000  ^-1 kms@xmath0  to broaden the absorption lines .",
    "this width includes the instrumental broadening , which as noted above , we could not separate from the intrinsic broadening . since the lines appear to be saturated , but no line goes to zero intensity in the trough , we obtain the best fit by assuming a covering factor of 0.7 for the x - ray continuum source . the best - fit column densities that we find for the different ions are consistent with a hydrogen column density of about @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "the emission lines are modeled using gaussians with uniform widths of @xmath31 ^-1 kms@xmath0  ( resolved , but again , including the instrumental broadening ) , with no velocity shift , and assumed to be unabsorbed .",
    "these lines at fwhm  @xmath32 @xmath33  ^-1 kms@xmath0  are even broader than those observed from the broad line region in the visible band ( @xmath34 ^-1 kms@xmath0 ; kaspi et al .",
    "the entire best - fit spectrum is shown in figure  [ pgtrgs ] ( red curve ) .",
    "the spectrum beyond 25    is particularly challenging as it comprises many unresolved lines from l - shell ions of si , s , and ar while the rgs effective area drops rapidly .",
    "several predicted lines may be observed here ( e.g. , arxiii - 28.92   , sixii - 30.71   , arxii - 31.06   , sxiii - 31.93   ; these wavelengths include the 3000 ^-1 kms@xmath0  shift ) .",
    "we are still unable to explain several features seen in the data , e.g. , around 8.5  , 10.4  , or 29.8  , but the model gives a good fit to the data overall .",
    "we have provided a self consistent model to the ionized outflow of pg1211 + 143  revealing an outflow velocity of approximately 3000  ^-1 kms@xmath0 .",
    "our model reproduces many absorption lines in the rgs band , although the s / n of the present data set is rather poor and some of the noise might be confused with absorption lines .",
    "the present approach is distinct from the commonly used global fitting methods and also from the line - by - line approach used by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "it allows for a physically consistent fit to the spectrum and is particularly appropriate for a broad - ionization - distribution absorber as observed here for pg1211 + 143 .",
    "the present model also features several broad ( fwhm = 6000  ^-1 kms@xmath0 ) emission lines , which are observed directly in the data .",
    "a broad and relatively flat ionization distribution is found throughout the x - ray outflow consistent with a hydrogen column density of roughly @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the outflow parameters measured in other well studied seyfert galaxies .",
    "we also detect fe - k absorption , which was identified by pounds et  al .",
    "( 2003a , 2005 ) as a strongly blueshifted fexxvi absorption line .",
    "we find that most of the fe - k opacity can alternatively be attributed to several consecutive , low charge states of fe , although it can not be assessed whether the absorber is co - moving with the outflow or not .",
    "future missions with microcalorimeter spectrometers on board might be able to address this interesting question .",
    "a second _ xmm - newton _  observation of pg1211 + 143  for @xmath35ks was carried out on 2004 june 21 , three years after the first observation of 2001 june 15 which is described above .",
    "we have retrieved the data of this second observation from the _ xmm - newton _  archive and reduced it in exactly the same way described above for the first observation .",
    "the data of the second rgs observation are plotted ( red line ) in figure  [ 2rgs ] over the first observation ( black line ) .",
    "the broad - band spectra of the two observations are generally consistent .",
    "however , not all narrow features are consistently reproduced .",
    "the total flux in the rgs band is the same in the two observations , though the continuum slope in the second observation the spectrum is somewhat harder .    when inspecting the detailed narrow features in the spectrum some have changed while others remain the same .",
    "for example , the second observations shows features which appear to be emission lines around 8  where the first observation had absorption lines . also ,",
    "around 15   the absorption lines seem to have disappeared in the second observation .",
    "conversely , some features are the same in the two spectra , for example , the emission ovii triplet around 22 and the neix triplet around 13.5  . from figure",
    "3 , it can be seen that due to the poor s / n in both spectra , it is extremely hard to determine whether the differences between the two spectra are real , or a mere result of the data s poor s / n .",
    "simultaneously with the 2004 june 21 _ xmm - newton _  observation , pg1211 + 143  was also observed with the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) on board the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "the letg observation of @xmath36  ks has made use of the acis ccds as the detector .",
    "we retrieved the data of this observation from the _ chandra archive _ and reduced it using ciao 3.2.1 and caldb version 3.01 , according to the updated ciao threads .",
    "we have combined the + 1 and -1 orders of the letg spectrum using a weighted mean and the combined spectrum is represented in figure  [ rgs_letg ] by a black line . the simultaneous rgs observation ( the red data in figure  [ 2rgs ] ) is shown in red in figure  [ rgs_letg ] .",
    "although the simultaneous data from the two x - ray observatories are consistent overall , they differ in many details .",
    "for example , the rgs data between 7 to 9   show several emission - like features which the letg data do not .",
    "also , around 16.4   the letg data show absorption - like features which are not present in the rgs data .",
    "these differences are consistent to within about 3@xmath17 and are probably a result of the poor s /",
    "n of the observations    after the first @xmath745ks letg observation of pg1211 + 143  on 2004 june 21 , which is described above , there were two more observations in consecutive orbits of the _ chandra _ observatory .",
    "the second @xmath36ks observation took place on 2004 june 23 and the third observation was on 2004 june 25 .",
    "these data are not presented here , but their spectra is in overall agreement with the first letg observation , _ except _ that the flux level in the last two observations was twice that of the first observation , i.e. , during a period of @xmath37 days the flux level doubled .",
    "this is somewhat unexpected for a source that had retained its flux level of three years earlier ( see figure  [ 2rgs ] ) .",
    "besides the change in flux between the three letg observations , there is also a change in the absorption features seen between the first observation and the other two .",
    "some of these features have disappeared between the first low - flux observation and the high - flux observations taken 2 days later , while other features seems to appear .",
    "the absorption features interpreted by reeves et al .",
    "( 2005 ) as evidence for sub - c gravitational infall are seen only in the second observation and not in the first or third ones .",
    "the fact that , again , absorption features are not reproduced in different spectra is rather confusing . if these lines are statistically significant ( see reeves et al .",
    "2005 ) then they represent a transient flow .",
    "we claim in kaspi & behar ( 2006 ) that an outflowing absorber at a velocity of 3000 ^-1 kms@xmath0  fits the first ( 2001 ) rgs data of pg1211 + 143  better than a 24000 ^-1 kms@xmath0  model . admittedly though , the poor s / n of those data can tolerate more than one interpretation .    a second rgs observation taken three years after the first observation shows general consistency with the first observation ,",
    "but differs in important details of the absorption lines relevant to the outflow .",
    "some features that appear in the first rgs observation disappear in the second one and vice versa .",
    "this could be a result of either short - time variability of the absorber ( almost impossible to prove or refute ) or the poor s / n of the data .",
    "even more confusing is the fact that _ simultaneous _ observations of pg1211 + 143  with rgs and letg produce spectra that are partially incompatible in their absorption lines .",
    "this significantly reduces our confidence in the existence of the absorption lines and even more so in their identification .",
    "the poor s / n of the data calls for extra caution and careful modeling .",
    "the three letg observations indicate that the continuum source changes on a timescale of days . if the discrete features seen in these spectra are real , they too vary on short timescales . with the loss of the high - resolution x - ray spectrometer ( xrs ) on board _ astro - e2 _ , a very long observation of a good , bright uhv - wind source with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _  gratings remains as the most viable approach toward testing what we feel is still a putative phenomenon of high velocity outflow .",
