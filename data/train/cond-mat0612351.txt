    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a driven lattice gas of particles that hop on a lattice and interact through hard - core exclusion .",
    "originally , the asep was proposed as a minimal model in one - dimensional transport phenomena with geometric constraints , such as hopping conductivity , motion of rna templates and traffic flow .",
    "the exclusion process displays a rich phenomenological behaviour and its relative simplicity has allowed to derive many exact results in one dimension . for these reasons , the asep has become one of the major models in the field of interacting particle systems both in the mathematical and the physical literature and plays the role of a paradigm in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ( for reviews , see e.g. , spohn 1991 , derrida 1998 , schtz 2001 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the evolution operator ( or markov matrix ) of the exclusion process can be mapped into a non - hermitian heisenberg spin chain of the xxz type ( gwa and spohn , 1992 ; essler and rittenberg 1996 ) .",
    "this mapping allows the use of the techniques of integrable systems such as the coordinate bethe ansatz ( for a review see , e.g. , golinelli and mallick , 2006b ) .",
    "spectral information about the evolution operator ( dhar 1987 ; gwa and spohn 1992 ; schtz 1993 ; kim 1995 ; golinelli and mallick 2005 ) and large deviation functions ( derrida and lebowitz 1998 ) can be derived with the help of coordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "besides , using the more elaborate algebraic bethe ansatz technique , the eigenstates of the markov matrix can be represented as matrix product states over finite dimensional quadratic algebra ( golinelli and mallick , 2006a ) .",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz also plays a fundamental role in the derivation of the bethe equations for asep with open boundaries ( de gier and essler , 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to explore the algebraic properties of the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) that stem from the algebra generated by the local jump operators that build the markov matrix .",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz technique allows to construct a hierarchy of generalized hamiltonians that contain the markov matrix and commute with each other .",
    "the generating operator for this family , called the transfer matrix , defines therefore a commuting family of operators that can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "we derive , using the local jump operators algebra , explicit formulae for the transfer matrix and the generalized hamiltonians and characterize their action on the configuration space .",
    "these generalized hamiltonians are non - local because they act on non - connected bonds of the lattice .",
    "however , connected operators are generated by taking the logarithm of the transfer matrix .",
    "we study these connected operators and give an explicit formula for them .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows  : in section 2 , we describe the basic algebraic properties of the totally asymmetric exclusion process and define the associated algebra . in section 3",
    ", we give explicit formulae for the transfer matrix and for the generalized hamiltonians that commute with the markov matrix @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we show that the transfer matrix can be interpreted as a discrete time markov process and we describe the non - local actions of the generalized hamiltonians . in section 4",
    ", we study the connected operators obtained by taking the logarithm of the transfer matrix and propose a conjectured general formula for these local operators",
    ". the actions of these operators are described explicitly . some mathematical proofs",
    "are given in the appendices .",
    "the simple exclusion process is a continuous - time markov process ( _ i.e. _ , without memory effects ) in which indistinguishable particles hop from one site to another on a discrete lattice and obey the _ exclusion rule _ which forbids to have more than one particle per site . in this work",
    ", we shall study the case of particles hopping on a periodic 1-d ring ( see figure  [ fig : periodicasep ] ) with @xmath1 sites labelled @xmath2 ( sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 are identical due to periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the particles move according to the following dynamics : during the time interval @xmath5 $ ] , a particle on a site @xmath3 jumps with probability @xmath6 to the neighboring site @xmath7 , if this site is empty .",
    "this model is called ` totally asymmetric ' because the particles can jump only in one direction .",
    "the exclusion rule forbids particles to overtake each other and their ordering remains unchanged .",
    "moreover , as the system is closed , the number of particles is constant .",
    "the state of a site @xmath3 is encoded in a boolean variable @xmath8 , where @xmath9 if @xmath3 is occupied and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "the two - dimensional state space of the site @xmath3 is noted @xmath11 ( we have @xmath12 ) and its basis is given by @xmath13 .",
    "a configuration @xmath14 of the system of @xmath1 sites is written as @xmath15 the state space @xmath16 of the ring is therefore a @xmath17 dimensional vector space given by @xmath18 due to the conservation of the number @xmath19 of particles , @xmath16 splits into invariant spaces @xmath20 of dimension @xmath21 $ ] , characterized by @xmath22 .",
    "the probability distribution of the system at time @xmath23 can be represented as a vector @xmath24 , where the component @xmath25 is the probability of being in the configuration @xmath14 at time @xmath23 .",
    "the vector @xmath26 evolves according to the _ master equation _",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath0 is a @xmath28 markov matrix acting on @xmath16 . for @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 is the transition rate from configuration @xmath14 to configuration @xmath31 : it is equal to 1 if @xmath31 is obtained from @xmath14 by an allowed jump of a particle , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the diagonal elements are negative and @xmath32 is the exit rate from @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of allowed jumps from @xmath14",

    "this property ensures probability conservation  : @xmath34 .    in the case of the tasep on a periodic ring , sums over rows of @xmath0 also vanish .",
    "this implies that the stationary probability , obtained for @xmath35 , is uniform over each subspace @xmath20 .",
    "the markov matrix can be written as @xmath36 where the local jump operator @xmath37 represents the contribution to the dynamics of jumps from the site @xmath3 to @xmath7 .",

    "the algebra generated by the @xmath37 operators will be called here the _",
    "tasep algebra_. we remark that the @xmath37 operators can be obtained as a limit of the temperley - lieb algebra generators .",
    "we shall call , by definition , a _ word _",
    ", any product of the @xmath37 s ; any element of the algebra can be written as a linear combination of words .",
    "the _ length _ of a word is the minimal number of operators @xmath37 required to write it .",
    "each word acts on the configuration space @xmath16 and can be described as a series of jumps .",
    "for example , the word @xmath47 describes a jump of a particle from site 2 to 3 , followed by a jump of another particle from site 1 to the site 2 ; the action of @xmath47 on a configuration vanishes unless @xmath48 and we have @xmath49 similarly , the word @xmath50 represents a jump of a particle from site 1 to 2 followed by a jump of the same particle from 2 to 3  : @xmath51 clearly , @xmath52 and @xmath53 do not commute because the jumps on two adjacent sites are not independent .",
    "we define here the ring - ordered product of jump matrices which will be used in the following sections .",
    "the ring - ordered product @xmath54 acts on words of the type @xmath55 by changing the positions of matrices that appear in @xmath56 according to the following rules  :    \\(i ) if @xmath57 or @xmath58 , we define @xmath59 .",
    "the word @xmath56 is well - ordered .",
    "\\(ii ) if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we first write @xmath56 as a product of two blocks , @xmath62 , such that @xmath63 is the maximal block of matrices with consecutive indices that contains @xmath41 , and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 , contains the remaining terms .",
    "we then define @xmath66    \\(iii ) the previous definition makes sense only for @xmath67 . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 and it is not possible to split @xmath56 in two different blocks @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for this special case , we define @xmath72 which is the projector on the ` full ' configuration with all sites occupied .",
    "the ring - ordering @xmath54 is extended by linearity to the vector space spanned by words of the type described above .",
    "let us give some examples . for @xmath73 or 1 ,",
    "the ring - ordered product acts trivially : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 when @xmath78 ; however , for the special case when @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the ring - ordered product embodies the periodic boundary conditions . on a ring ,",
    "the natural order between integers is not valid .",
    "indeed , @xmath41 and @xmath52 act as neighbouring bonds and site @xmath1 should be viewed as being behind site 1 , just as site 1 is behind site 2 .",
    "the ring - order product restores the correct order on a ring and allows to construct operators that are translation invariant .",
    "for example , for @xmath82 , the operator @xmath83 is not well - ordered and does not commute with translations .",
    "but , @xmath84 is well - ordered and does commute with translations .",
    "finally , we remark that when a ring - ordered product acts on a configuration , each particle advances by at most one lattice unit  : indeed , because terms such as @xmath85 do not appear in a ring - ordered product , no particle can perform multiple jumps .",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz is a method for diagonalizing the hamiltonian of integrable models ( for a review , see , e.g. , korepin et al . 1993 ; for a pedagogical introduction , see , e.g. , nepomechie 1999 ) .",
    "this technique can be applied to the markov matrix @xmath0 of the tasep ( golinelli and mallick , 2006b ) .",
    "the key step is to construct a family of transfer matrices , @xmath86 , which act on the configuration space @xmath16 . for any value @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the spectral parameter",
    ", we have @xmath89 = 0 \\ , .    \\label{tt}\\ ] ] thus , the operators @xmath86 form a one - parameter family of commuting operators which depend on a real number @xmath87 , called the spectral parameter .",
    "this family contains the markov matrix @xmath0 as will be shown below .",
    "therefore , all the @xmath86 s share with @xmath0 a _ common _ eigenvector basis independent of @xmath87 . for the tasep",
    ", these eigenvectors are determinants of matrices involving the roots of the bethe equations and the corresponding eigenvalues are functions of @xmath87 ( see e.g. , golinelli and mallick 2006b for an explicit formula ) .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath86 is a polynomial in @xmath87 of degree @xmath1  : we can thus define @xmath90 as follows @xmath91 the @xmath92 operators are @xmath28 matrices acting on the configuration space @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath92 s will be called ` generalized hamiltonians ' by analogy with quantum spin systems ( arnaudon et al . 2005 ) .",
    "as the @xmath92 s are derivatives of @xmath86 , they also commute with each other  : @xmath93 = 0 ,    \\ \\ \\ \\    [ h_j , h_k ] = 0    \\label{hthh}\\ ] ] for all @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath87 .",
    "more generally , any operator generated from @xmath86 , or equivalently from the generalized hamiltonians , belongs to the same commuting family .",
    "the above considerations are familiar in the framework of algebraic bethe ansatz . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : aba ] , we explain how the transfer matrix can be constructed using this method .      in this section",
    "we describe our results which are specific to the tasep and give explicit formulae for the generalized hamiltonians @xmath92 .",
    "the calculations leading to these expressions are carried out in detail in appendix  [ app : calculhk ] .",
    "the @xmath96 operator appearing in equation  ( [ thk ] ) is the _ translation operator _ on the ring and is defined as @xmath97    the operator @xmath98 given by @xmath99 is precisely the markov matrix @xmath0 which thus belongs to the commuting family generated by @xmath86 .",
    "all the @xmath92 s can be explicitly calculated . by using the `` ring - ordered product '' defined in section  [ section : op ]",
    ", we find in appendix  [ app : calculhk ] that for @xmath100 , @xmath101 in particular , we have @xmath102 and according to equation  ( [ m1ml ] ) , @xmath103 for @xmath67 , all the terms in @xmath92 are products of @xmath95 jump matrices which , because of ring - ordering , correspond to @xmath95 _ different _ particles jumping simultaneously one step forward .",
    "thus , @xmath92 has a non - vanishing action only on configurations with at least @xmath95 particles .    in the case with @xmath104 , for example , the generalized hamiltonians are given by @xmath105    using eqs .",

    "however , we shall now prove that the matrix @xmath86 is the markov matrix of a discrete time process when @xmath108 .",

    "the quantities @xmath130 can thus interpreted as probabilities .",
