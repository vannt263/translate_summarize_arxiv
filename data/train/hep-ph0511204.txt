    ", neutrino interactions offer unique opportunities for exploring fundamental questions in these domains of the physics .",
    "one of these questions is the neutrino - oscillation phenomenon , for which there have been conclusive positive signals in the last years  @xcite .",
    "neutrino - oscillation experiments are presently evolving from the discovery to the precision phase .",
    "this new generation of experiments faces a major difficulty : the elusive nature of the neutrinos .",
    "the presence of neutrinos , being chargeless particles , can only be inferred by detecting the secondary particles they create when colliding and interacting with matter .",
    "nuclei are often used as neutrino detectors , thus a trustable interpretation of neutrino data heavily relies on detailed and quantitative knowledge of the features of the neutrino - nucleus interaction  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of neutrino processes driven by the electroweak neutral current ( nc ) , the energy spectrum and angular distribution of the ejected nucleons are the unique observables .",
    "there is a general consensus among the theorists that a simple fermi gas model , widely used in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments , fails to provide a satisfactory description of the measured cross sections , and inclusion of further nuclear effects is needed  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , in recent years there have also been some initiatives aiming at understanding the quark and gluon substructure of the nucleon .",
    "the flavor dependence of the nucleon s spin is a significant fundamental question that is not yet fully understood .",
    "experiments  @xcite measuring the spin content of the nucleon have reported conflicting results on the amount of nucleon spin carried by strange quarks  @xcite .",
    "recently , the finesse collaboration at fermilab has suggested  @xcite that quasi - elastic ( qe ) neutrino  nucleus scattering , observed using a novel detection technique , provides a theoretically clean measure of this quantity . in this context , it is also necessary to control nuclear effects .    at intermediate energies , above the nuclear giant resonance and below the @xmath4 regionsexcitation in neutrino reactions ,",
    "there are works , among others , by alvarez - ruso and collaborators  @xcite , s.k . singh and collaborators  @xcite and lalakulich",
    "y paschos  @xcite . ] , neutrino  nucleus interactions have been studied within several approaches .",
    "several different fermi gas , random phase approximation ( rpa ) , shell model and superscaling based calculations have been developed during the last 15 years  @xcite@xcite . some of these approaches have been also employed to compute neutrino or antineutrino induced single  nucleon emission cross sections .",
    "most of the calculations use the plane wave and distorted wave impulse approximations ( pwia and dwia , respectively ) , including or not relativistic effects .",
    "the pwia calculations neglect all types of interactions between the ejected nucleon and the residual nuclear system , and therefore such a framework constitutes a poor approximation to evaluate nucleon emission cross sections .",
    "however , the pwia has been often used to compute the ratio of proton @xmath5 to neutron @xmath6 yields , which at low neutrino energies and for light nuclei might be rather insensitive to rescattering effects .    within the dwia",
    "the ejected nucleon is described as a solution to the dirac or schrdinger equation with an optical potential obtained by fitting elastic proton  nucleus scattering data .",
    "the imaginary part accounts for the absorption into unobserved channels .",
    "this scheme , first developed in @xmath7 studies where the final nucleus is left in the ground or in a particular excited state , is incorrect to study nucleon emission processes where the state of the final nucleus is totally unobserved , and thus all final nuclear configurations , either in the discrete or on the continuum , contribute .",
    "the distortion of the nucleon wave function by a complex optical potential removes all events where the nucleons collide with other nucleons .",
    "thus , in dwia calculations , the nucleons that interact are lost when in the physical process they simply come off the nucleus with a different energy , angle , and maybe charge , and they should definitely be taken into account .",
    "a clear example which illustrates the deficiencies of the dwia models is the neutron emission process : @xmath8 . within the impulse approximation",
    "neutrinos only interact via charged current ( cc ) interactions with neutrons and would emit protons , and therefore the dwia will predict zero cross sections for cc one neutron knock - out reactions .",
    "however , the primary protons interact strongly with the medium and collide with other nucleons which are also ejected . as a consequence",
    "there is a reduction of the flux of high energy protons but a large number of secondary nucleons , many of them neutrons , of lower energies appear .",
    "the distortion by a real potential does not eliminate the events where there are nucleon collisions .",
    "but , it does not account either for the changes of energy , direction and charge of the nucleons induced by these collisions .",
    "besides , it can not account either for more than one nucleon knock - out events .    in this work , we study the qe contribution to the inclusive @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath3 reactions in nuclei .",
    "we use a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation method to account for the rescattering of the outgoing nucleon .",
    "a reliable description of the gauge bosons ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) absorption in the nucleus is the first essential ingredient .    for cc driven processes , we use the many body framework developed in ref .",
    "starting from a local fermi gas ( lfg ) picture of the nucleus , which automatically accounts for pauli blocking , several nuclear effects are taken into account in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite : _ i ) _ a correct energy balance , using the experimental @xmath12values , is enforced , _ ii ) _ coulomb distortion of the charged leptons is implemented by using the so called `` modified effective momentum approximation ''  @xcite , _ iii ) _ medium polarization ( rpa ) , including @xmath13hole degrees of freedom and explicit pion and rho exchanges in the vector ",

    "nucleon force , and short range correlation ( src ) effects are computed , and finally _ iv ) _ the nucleon propagators are dressed in the nuclear medium , which amounts to work with a lfg of interacting nucleons and it also accounts for reaction mechanisms where the gauge boson , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , is absorbed by two nucleons ( the real part of the nucleon selfenergy modifies the free nucleon dispersion relation , while the imaginary part takes into account two nucleon absorption reaction channels ) .",
    "the model has no free parameters .",
    "the @xmath16 couplings and form factors are fixed in the vacuum , while the main features concerning the nuclear corrections , expansion parameter and all sorts of constants , are completely fixed from previous hadron - nucleus studies ( pionic atoms , elastic and inelastic pion - nucleus reactions , @xmath17 hypernuclei , etc . )",
    "thus , the model is a natural extension of previous studies  @xcite on electron , photon and pion dynamics in nuclei , and should be able to describe inclusive cc qe neutrino and antineutrino nuclear reactions at intermediate energies of interest for future neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "even though the scarce existing cc data involve very low nuclear excitation energies , for which specific details of the nuclear structure might play an important role , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite provides one of the best existing combined description of the inclusive muon capture in @xmath18c and of the measurements of the @xmath18c @xmath19 and @xmath18c @xmath20 reactions near threshold .",
    "inclusive muon capture from other nuclei is also successfully described by the model .",
    "besides , above , let us say 80 or 100 mev of energy transferred to the nucleus , this many body framework leads also to excellent results for the @xmath21 inclusive reaction in nuclei , not only in the qe region , but also when it is extended to the study of the @xmath13peak and the dip region ( situated between the qe and the @xmath22 peaks )  @xcitec , @xmath23ca and @xmath24pb of differential cross sections for different electron kinematics and split into longitudinal and transverse response functions are successfully described . ] and to the description of the absorption of real photons by nuclei  @xcite .    in sect .",

    "this cross section gives us the reaction probability and it is the first required ingredient to start with our cascade model to describe the collisions suffered by the nucleons through their way out of the nucleus .",
    "thus , we also know the point of the nucleus where the gauge boson was absorbed , and we can start from there our mc propagation of the ejected nucleon . ] .",

    "finally , in the appendix we give explicit expressions for the nc nucleon tensor , both in the impulse approximation and when rpa corrections are taken into account .",
    "to end this introduction , we would like to devote a few words on the applicability of the nuclear model used here .",
    "one might think that a lfg description of the nucleus is poor , and that a proper finite nuclei treatment is necessary .",
    "for inclusive processes and nuclear excitation energies of around 100 mev or higher , the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite clearly contradict this conclusion .",
    "the reason is that in these circumstances one should sum up over several nuclear configurations , both in the discrete and in the continuum , and this inclusive sum is almost not sensitive to the details of the nuclear wave function s@xmath41 in @xmath18c to 1300 @xmath42 s@xmath41 in @xmath24pb , and of the lsnd measurements of the @xmath18c @xmath19 and @xmath18c @xmath20 reactions near threshold indicate that the predictions of our scheme , for totally integrated inclusive observables , could even be extended to much smaller , of the order of 10 or 20 mev , nuclear excitation energies . in this respect ,",
    "the works of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for inclusive muon capture and radiative pion capture in nuclei , respectively , turn out to be quite enlightening . in those works ,",
    "continuum shell model results are compared to those obtained from a lfg model for several nuclei from @xmath18c to @xmath24pb .",
    "the differential decay width shapes predicted for the two set of models are substantially different .",
    "shell model distributions present discrete contributions and in the continuum appear sharp scattering resonances .",
    "despite the fact that those distinctive features do not appear in the lfg differential decay widths , the totally integrated widths ( inclusive observable ) obtained from both descriptions of the process do not differ in more than 5 or 10% .",
    "the typical nuclear excitation energies in muon and radiative pion capture in nuclei are small , of the order of 20 mev , and thus one expects that at higher excitation energies , where one should sum up over a larger number of nuclear final states , the lfg predictions for inclusive observables would become even more reliable .",
    "] , in sharp contrast to what happens in the case of exclusive processes where the final nucleus is left in a determined nuclear level . on the other hand ,",
    "the lfg description of the nucleus allows for an accurate treatment of the dynamics of the elementary processes ( interaction of gauge bosons with nucleons , nucleon resonances , and mesons , interaction between nucleons or between mesons and nucleons , etc . ) which occur inside the nuclear medium . within a finite nuclei scenario ,",
    "such a treatment becomes hard to implement , and often the dynamics is simplified in order to deal with more elaborated nuclear wave functions .",
    "this simplification of the dynamics can not lead to a good description of nuclear inclusive electroweak processes at the intermediate energies of interest for future neutrino experiments .",
    "we will first focus on the neutrino induced inclusive reaction driven by the electroweak nc @xmath43 and we will follow the same notation and convention as in ref .  @xcite . the double differential cross section , with respect to the outgoing neutrino kinematical variables , for the process of eq .",
