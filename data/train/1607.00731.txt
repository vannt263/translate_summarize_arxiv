    "the `` seifert conjecture '' , as originally formulated in 1950 by seifert @xcite , asked : `` does every non - singular vector field on the @xmath1-sphere @xmath0 have a periodic orbit ? ''",
    "this problem became more specific following the construction in 1966 by f.w .",
    "wilson @xcite of a smooth flow on a _ plug _ with exactly two periodic orbits .",
    "( see also the later paper with percel @xcite . )",
    "these wilson plugs could then be used to modify any given flow on a @xmath1-manifold to obtain one with only isolated periodic orbits .",
    "thus , the seifert conjecture is reduced to showing that a flow on a @xmath1-manifold with only a finite number of periodic orbits can be perturbed to one with no periodic orbits .",
    "paul schweitzer showed in the 1974 work @xcite how to modify the construction of the wilson plug in several fundamental ways , to obtain a @xmath2-flow with no periodic orbits in the plug .",
    "( see also rosenberg s survey @xcite . )",
    "he then used this plug to show that for any closed @xmath1-manifold @xmath3 , there exists a non - singular @xmath2-vector field on @xmath3 without periodic orbits .",
    "jenny harrison constructed in @xcite a modified version of the schweitzer construction , which she used to construct an aperiodic plug with a @xmath4-flow .",
    "finally , in 1994 krystyna kuperberg constructed in @xcite counter - examples to the smooth version of the seifert conjecture .",
    "[ kuperberg ] [ thm - maink ] on every closed oriented 3-manifold @xmath3 , there exists a @xmath5 non - vanishing vector field without periodic orbits .",
    "the fascination with this result has many sources .",
    "the proof itself introduced a construction of aperiodic@xmath1-dimensional plugs which was notable for its simplicity and beauty .",
    "the kuperberg construction remains the only general method to date to construct @xmath5-flows without periodic orbits on arbitrary closed 3-manifolds .",
    "the introductory comments in the sminaire bourbaki article by ghys @xcite discusses the background and obstacles to the construction of aperiodic flows .",
    "kuperberg has given a brief introduction to the use of plugs in her proof of this result here @xcite .",
    "the dynamical properties of the kuperberg flows in these plugs also have many special qualities .",
    "the flows must have zero topological entropy , which follows by an observation of ghys in @xcite that an aperiodic flow on a 3-manifold has topological entropy equal to zero , that is a consequence of a well - known result of katok in @xcite .",
    "the aperiodic flows in the kuperberg plugs have a unique minimal set , whose structure is unknown in general , and moreover the generic kuperberg flow preserves a @xmath6-dimensional compact lamination with boundary that is contained in the interior of the plug , and contains the minimal set . finally , the kuperberg flows have an open set of non - recurrent points that limit on the minimal set , by a result of matsumoto @xcite , which adds more to the complexity of the dynamical properties of these flows",
    ".    there followed after kuperberg s seminal work , a collection of works explaining in further detail the proof of the aperiodicity for the kuperberg flow in a plug , and investigated its dynamical properties :    * the sminaire bourbaki lecture @xcite by tienne ghys ; * the notes by shigenori matsumoto @xcite in japanese , later translated into english ; * the joint paper @xcite by greg kuperberg and krystyna kuperberg ; * the monograph @xcite by the authors .",
    "moreover , a notable feature about the construction of these plugs , is that there are many choices in their construction , which influence the global dynamics of the resulting flows . as ghys wrote in @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ par ailleurs , on peut construire beaucoup de piges de kuperberg et il nest pas clair quils aient le mme dynamique . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the works cited above suggest many interesting open problems concerning the dynamics of kuperberg flows .",
    "also , the dynamical properties of flows constructed by variants of the kuperberg construction which are not aperiodic are studied in @xcite , showing that the kuperberg flows are indeed very special , as they lie at the `` boundary of chaos '' in the @xmath7-topology on flows .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to collect together these open problems , as well as to formulate more precisely further questions about kuperberg flows which have arisen in their study , to illuminate the surprising dynamical complexities of the flows that can arise in this very special class of examples .",
    "we first describe the construction of the kuperberg plugs in sections  [ sec - wilson ] and [ sec - kuperberg ] , with an emphasis on the choices involved .",
    "section  [ sec - wilson ] gives the construction of the modified wilson plugs , which are the foundation of the construction .",
    "section  [ sec - kuperberg ] gives the construction of the kuperberg plugs .",
    "these constructions are given in a succinct manner , and the interested reader should consult the literature cited above for further details and discussions .",
    "section  [ sec - generic ] introduces the additional assumptions imposed on the constructions of kuperberg flows in the works @xcite , which are called the _",
    "generic hypotheses_. we also introduce variations of these generic hypotheses , whose implications for the dynamics of the flows will be discussed in later sections .",
    "it was observed in the works @xcite that any orbit not escaping the plug in forward or backward time , limits to the invariant set defined as the closure of the `` special orbits '' for the flow .",
    "one consequence is that the kuperberg flow in a plug has a unique minimal set , denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "theorem  [ thm - minimal ] recalls these results .",
    "it is a remarkable aspect of the construction of the kuperberg flows , that they preserve an embedded infinite surface with boundary , denoted by @xmath9 , which contains the special orbits , and so that its closure @xmath10 is a type of lamination with boundary that contains the unique minimal set .",
    "the relation between the two sets @xmath11 is an important theme in the study of the dynamics of kuperberg flows .",
    "section  [ sec - lamination ] gives an outline of the structure theory for the embedded surface @xmath9 in the case of generic flows , which was developed in @xcite .",
    "this structure theory , and the corresponding properties of the level function defined on @xmath9 , are crucial for the proofs of many of the properties of the minimal set @xmath8 in @xcite .    in section  [ sec - denjoy ]",
    ", we consider the relation between the minimal set @xmath8 and the laminated space @xmath12 , and recall the conditions necessary to show they are equal .",
    "this result is a type of `` denjoy theorem '' for laminations , and its proof in @xcite relies on the generic hypotheses on the flow in fundamental ways .",
    "we consider how the properties of the embedding @xmath11 depend on variations of the generic hypotheses imposed on the flow .",
    "an interesting problem is a general formulation of a denjoy theorem for laminations , that we present here as it is independent of the construction of the kuperberg plug .",
    "let @xmath13 be a compact connected 2-dimensional and codimension 1 lamination , and let @xmath14 be a smooth vector field tangent to the leaves of @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath13 is minimal and the flow of @xmath14 has no periodic orbits , show that every orbit is dense .",
    "ghys observed in @xcite that an aperiodic flow must have entropy equal to zero , using a well - known result of katok @xcite , and thus the kuperberg flows must have zero entropy . in the work @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that in fact , while the usual entropy of the flow vanishes , the `` slow entropy '' as defined in @xcite of a generic kuperberg flow is positive for exponent @xmath15 .",
    "this calculation used the fact that the embedded surface @xmath16 has subexponential but not polynomial growth rate , which follows from the structure theory developed for it in the generic case .",
    "finally , these results suggests the study of the hausdorff dimensions of the sets @xmath8 and @xmath12 and how they depend on the choices used in the construction of the kuperberg flow . these and related questions are addressed in section  [ sec - entropy ] .    a standard problem in topological dynamical systems theory is to describe the topological type of the closed attractors for the system , and for closed invariant transitive subsets more generally .",
    "attractors often have very complicated topological description , and the theory of shape for spaces @xcite is used to describe them . for example , the shape of the unique minimal set @xmath8 for a _ generic _ kuperberg flow is shown in @xcite to be _ not stable _ , but to satisfy a _ mittag - leffler property _ on its homology groups .",
    "the proof of these assertions requires essentially all of the material developed in the monograph @xcite .",
    "describing the shape of a dynamically defined invariant set of an arbitrary flow is typically quite difficult , but also can be highly revealing about the dynamical properties of the flow . in section  [ sec - shape ] , we discuss questions concerning the shape properties of the minimal set for general kuperberg flows .    the proofs in @xcite suggest a strong relation between the shape approximations of the minimal set @xmath8 and the entropy of the flow . the following problem can be stated for general flows and the motivation is given in section  [ sec - shape ] and problem  [ prob - shape4 ] .",
    "assume that a flow has an exceptional minimal set whose shape is not stable .",
    "is the slow entropy of the flow positive ?    a minimal set",
    "is said to be exceptional if it is not a submanifold of the ambient manifold .",
    "we conjecture that part of the hypothesis needed to show that the shape is related with the entropy of the flow is that the minimal set has `` small '' dimension , that is dimension 1 or 2 .",
    "the derived from kuperberg flows , or dk  flows , were introduced in @xcite , and are obtained by varying the construction of the usual kuperberg flows so that the periodic orbits are not `` broken open '' .",
    "thus , the dk ",
    "flows are quite useless as counterexamples to the seifert conjecture , but they are obtained by smooth variations of the standard kuperberg flows , so are of central interest from the point of view of the properties of kuperberg flows in the space of flows .",
    "the work @xcite gave constructions of dk  flows which in fact have countably many independent horseshoe subsystems , and thus have positive topological entropy .",
    "moreover , these examples can be constructed arbitrarily close to the generic kuperberg flows .",
    "section  [ sec - dk ] discusses a variety of questions about the flows which are @xmath7-close to kuperberg flows .",
    "one topic in particular is notable , that the horseshoes generated by a variation of the construction , are created using the shape approximations discussed in section  [ sec - shape ] , providing more reasons to explore the relation between shape and entropy for flows .",
    "the authors dedicate this work to krystyna kuperberg , both for her discovery of the class of dynamical systems introduced in her celebrated works on aperiodic flows , and whose comments and suggestions to the authors have been important both over the course of writing the monograph @xcite , and have inspired our continued fascination with `` kuperberg flows '' .",
    "in this section and the next , we present the construction of the kuperberg plugs which are the basis for the proof of theorem  [ thm - maink ] , with commentary on the choices made in the process .",
    "first , we recall that a `` plug '' is a manifold with boundary endowed with a flow , that enables the modification of a given flow on a @xmath1-manifold inside a flow - box .",
    "the idea is that after modification by insertion of a plug , a periodic orbit for the given flow is `` broken open ''  it enters the plug and never exits",
    ". moreover , kuperberg s construction does this modification without introducing additional periodic orbits .",
    "the first step is to construct kuperberg s modified wilson plug , which is analogous to the modified wilson plug used by schweitzer in @xcite .",
    "the notion of a `` plug '' to be inserted in a flow on a @xmath1-manifold was introduced by wilson @xcite .",
    "a @xmath1-dimensional plug is a manifold @xmath17 endowed with a vector field @xmath14 satisfying the following conditions .",
    "the 3-manifold @xmath17 is of the form @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 is a compact 2-manifold with boundary @xmath20 .",
    "set @xmath21 \\quad , \\quad \\partial_h^- p = d \\times \\{-2\\ } \\quad ,",
    "\\quad \\partial_h^+ p = d \\times \\{2\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] then the boundary of @xmath17 has a decomposition @xmath22 let @xmath23 be the _ vertical _ vector field on @xmath17 , where @xmath24 is the coordinate of the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the vector field @xmath14 must satisfy the conditions :    * _ vertical at the boundary _ :",
    "@xmath26 in a neighborhood of @xmath27 ; thus , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the entry and exit regions of @xmath17 for the flow of @xmath14 , respectively ; * _ entry - exit condition _ :",
    "if a point @xmath30 is in the same trajectory as @xmath31 , then @xmath32 .",
    "that is , an orbit that traverses @xmath17 , exits just in front of its entry point ; * _ trapped orbit _ :",
    "there is at least one entry point whose entire _ forward _ orbit is contained in @xmath17 ; we will say that its orbit is _ trapped _ by @xmath17 ; * _ tame _ : there is an embedding @xmath33 that preserves the vertical direction .",
    "note that conditions ( p2 ) and ( p3 ) imply that if the forward orbit of a point @xmath30 is trapped , then the backward orbit of @xmath34 is also trapped .",
    "a _ semi - plug _ is a manifold @xmath17 endowed with a vector field @xmath14 as above , satisfying conditions ( p1 ) , ( p3 ) and ( p4 ) , but not necessarily ( p2 ) .",
    "the concatenation of a semi - plug with an inverted copy of it , that is a copy where the direction of the flow is inverted , is then a plug .",
    "note that condition ( p4 ) implies that given any open ball @xmath35 with @xmath36 , there exists a modified embedding @xmath37 which preserves the vertical direction again .",
    "thus , a plug can be used to change a vector field @xmath38 on any @xmath1-manifold @xmath3 inside a flowbox , as follows .",
    "let @xmath39 be a coordinate chart which maps the vector field @xmath38 on @xmath3 to the vertical vector field @xmath23 .",
    "choose a modified embedding @xmath40 , and then replace the flow @xmath23 in the interior of @xmath41 with the image of @xmath14 .",
    "this results in a flow @xmath42 on @xmath3 .",
    "the entry - exit condition implies that a periodic orbit of @xmath38 which meets @xmath43 in a non - trapped point , will remain periodic after this modification .",
    "an orbit of @xmath38 which meets @xmath43 in a trapped point never exits the plug @xmath17 , hence after modification , limits to a closed invariant set contained in @xmath17 .",
    "a closed invariant set contains a minimal set for the flow , and thus , a plug serves as a device to insert a minimal set into a flow .    in the work of wilson @xcite ,",
    "the basic plug has the shape of a solid cylinder , whose base @xmath44 is a planar disk @xmath45 .",
    "schweitzer introduced in @xcite plugs for which the base is obtained from a @xmath6-torus minus an open disk , so @xmath46 , which has the homotopy type of a wedge of two circles .",
    "as we shall see below , a key idea behind the kuperberg construction is to consider a base which is obtained from an annulus by adding two connecting strips , so has the homotopy type of three circles .",
    "the `` modified wilson plug '' is a flow on a cylinder minus its core .",
    "the flow has two periodic orbits , and the dynamics of the flow is not stable under perturbations .",
    "the instability of its dynamics is a key property for its role in breaking open periodic orbits .",
    "the first step in the construction is to define a flow on a rectangle as follows .",
    "the rectangle is defined by @xmath47\\times[-2,2 ] = \\{(r , z ) \\mid 1 \\leq r \\leq 3 ~ \\",

    "define the vector field @xmath56 which has two singularities , @xmath57 , and is otherwise everywhere vertical .",
    "the flow lines of this vector field are illustrated in figure  [ fig : wilson1 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath58 chosen influences the quantitative nature of the flow , as small values of @xmath58 result in a slower vertical climb for the flow , but does not alter the qualitative nature of the flow .",
    "[ fig : wilson1],width=113 ]    the next step is to suspend the flow of the vector field @xmath59 to obtain a flow on the @xmath1-dimensional plug .",
    "this is done as follows , where we make more precise choices of the suspension flow than given in @xcite , though these choices do not matter so much .",
