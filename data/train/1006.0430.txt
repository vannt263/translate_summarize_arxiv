    "according to our current understanding , reionization of neutral hydrogen ( ) is most likely an extended process operating over redshifts @xmath8 and is most likely driven by stellar sources forming within galaxies ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution at these epochs is characterized by ionized bubbles centered around galaxies , with characteristic sizes determined by the efficiency of photon production and the clustering properties of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "these bubbles overlap as reionization proceeds , and the ( ionized hydrogen ) distribution develops a complex topology .",
    "statistical probes of the redshifted 21-cm signal , like the power spectrum ( see @xcite for a review ) and the bispectrum @xcite , carry signatures of these bubbles .",
    "a detection of the statistical signal would indirectly constrain the bubble distribution . in contrast , it would be possible to directly probe this by detecting the individual regions .    at this moment it is not clear whether the first generation of 21-cm observations would be able to detect the detailed topology of regions and constrain reionization histories .",
    "most likely , the present day instruments ( gmrt @xcite ) or those expected in the near future ( e.g. , mwa , lofar ) might just be adequate for detecting the presence or absence of an ionized region",
    ". the first target could possibly be detection of bubbles around targeted luminous sources ( say , quasars ) which can have much larger sizes than the typical galaxy generated ionized regions .",
    "the growth of such a region may , in the simplest situation , be modeled as a spherical ionized bubble embedded in a uniform neutral medium and its growth can be followed analytically @xcite .",
    "the redshifted 21-cm signal from such a bubble will be buried in foregrounds and noise , both of which are considerably larger than the signal . further the noise in different pixels of a radio interferometric image is correlated .",
    "it is a big challenge to detect this faint redshifted 21-cm signal of an ionized bubble .",
    "@xcite ( hitherto paper i ) have developed a visibility based matched filter technique that optimally combines the signal of an extended bubble while removing foregrounds and minimizing the noise .",
    "the analysis shows that density fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen outside the bubble impose a limit on the comoving radius of the smallest bubble that can be detected .",
    "this limit is independent of the observing time .",
    "simulations show ( @xcite ; hitherto paper ii ) that bubbles of comoving radius @xmath9 and @xmath10 can not respectively be detected using the gmrt and the mwa respectively , however large be the observing time .",
    "in addition , it is also possible to show that the redshift @xmath7 is optimum for bubble detection ( @xcite ; hitherto paper iii ) . at the redshift @xmath11 , for a bubble located at the center of the field of view ( fov ) , it will be possible to detect ( @xmath12 ) a bubble of comoving radius @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 hrs of observation using the gmrt and mwa respectively provided the gas outside the bubble is completely neutral .",
    "this prediction is somewhat modified if a significant fraction of the neutral gas outside the bubble is ionized by @xmath7 .",
    "in a situation where the neutral hydrogen fraction outside the bubble is @xmath16 at @xmath11 @xcite , the comoving radius of the smallest bubble that can be detected in @xmath15 hrs of observation is @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the gmrt and mwa respectively .",
    "most of the analysis of matched filter bubble detection ( papers i , ii and iii ) assumes the ionized region to be a spherical bubble .",
    "however , a growing spherical bubble will appear anisotropic for a present day observer due to the finite light travel time ( fltt ) @xcite , and due to the evolution of the global ionized fraction @xcite .",
    "these anisotropies , if detected , would provide important information about the quasar luminosity and the evolution of the global ionization fraction . while this is an interesting possibility , it is unlikely that it will be feasible to discern such details using either the present day instruments ( gmrt ) or those expected in the near future.(eg .",
    "mwa ) which are just adequate for detecting the presence or absence of an ionized bubble . given this",
    ", it would be most appropriate to search for ionized regions using a spherical bubble as a template in the matched filter technique",
    ". the search can either be completely blind where we vary the four parameters @xmath19 $ ] , or it can be targeted along a known quasar where it is sufficient to vary @xmath20 $ ] . here @xmath21 are respectively the two angular coordinates and redshift of the bubble center , while @xmath22 is the bubble s comoving radius . in the matched filter analysis , the signal to noise ratio is maximum when the parameters of the filter exactly match those of the bubble actually present in the data .",
    "in other words , a detection is achieved by varying the parameters of the filter so that it is exactly matched to the signal of the bubble that is actually present in the data .",
    "the apparent anisotropies will , however , introduce a mismatch between the signal and the filters .",
    "this is potentially a serious issue for both a blind search and targeted bubble detection . in this paper",
    "we study the impact of this apparent anisotropy on our ability to detect ionized bubbles in a targeted search around a known quasar using the matched filter technique .    in reality",
    "apart from these anisotropies the ionized regions around quasars would not be spherical because of various other effects like inhomogeneities in the igm , overlapping ionized bubbles arising from stellar sources and possible anisotropic emission from the quasar itself .",
    "moreover , the foreground subtraction could also subtract a part of the signal , which may change the recovered bubble shape .",
    "the anisotropy in bubble shape caused by these effects would vary from bubble to bubble , and it is rather difficult to incorporate these effects in our analytical estimations , so we do not attempt this here . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied several of these effects using semi - numerical simulations .    a brief outline of the paper follows . in section 2 .",

    "this is reversed in the later stages where the growth is enhanced with respect to the situation where @xmath37 is constant .",
    "for the parameter range that we have considered , the difference in the bubble radius due to the evolution of @xmath37 is found to be less than @xmath197 .",
    "further , there is a significant difference only at the later stages of the bubble s growth @xmath198 .",
    "we next consider the effect of the evolution of @xmath37 on the anisotropy and shift parameters @xmath96 and @xmath95 ( figure [ fig : eta_s ] ) .",
    "we find that the effect is maximum when the bubble is seen in the late stage of its growth where the apparent image is compressed along the line of sight .",
    "the evolution of @xmath37 acts to reduce the compression and increase the shift relative to a situation where @xmath37 is constant .",

    "the changes being extremely small , we have not explicitly shown these results .",
    "the discussion till now has focused on a large bubble with @xmath200 .",
    "the effect of the evolution of @xmath37 will be less for smaller bubbles .",
    "the apparent image of a quasar generated , spherical ionized region appears anisotropic due to the finite light travel time and the evolution of the global neutral fraction .",

    "we find that the anisotropy is less than @xmath201 for most of the parameter space that we have considered .",
    "further , the bubble appears compressed along the los for nearly the entire parameter range where a detection is possible .",
    "in addition to the anisotropy , the bubble s center is also shifted from the actual position of the quasar along the los .",
    "this shift , which can be rather large and may exceed the bubble radius .",
    "typically varies across the range @xmath202 .",
    "we find that these effects do not cause a significant degradation of the snr in matched filter bubble search and spherical filters are adequate for a preliminary bubble detection .",
    "we show that such a detection where the radius of the best match filter , its center and the quasar redshift are all known can be used to estimate @xmath66 the age of the quasar .",
    "this detection also provides an estimate of the neutral fraction @xmath37 provided the quasar luminosity is known .",
    "follow up observations , subsequent to a detection , can in principle be used to measure the anisotropy which would impose further constrains on the quasar luminosity , @xmath66 and @xmath37 .",
    "the global neutral fraction is not expected to evolve very rapidly with @xmath162 around @xmath11 , and this make a rather small change @xmath203 for the anisotropy and the shift relative a situation where @xmath37 is constant .    an earlier work ( paper iii ) has shown that both the gmrt or the mwa are most sensitive to the signal from an ionized bubble if it is at a redshift @xmath7 . at this @xmath162 a bubble of comoving radius @xmath204 mpc and @xmath205 mpc can respectively be detected at @xmath183 and @xmath182 significance with @xmath15 hrs of observation .",
    "this , however , presupposes the presence of an ionized bubble located near the center of the fov .",
    "it is , however , necessary to take into account the abundance of ionized bubbles when considering possible observational strategies .",
    "how many bubbles do we expect to find above the detection threshold in a single gmrt observational volume at redshift @xmath11 ?",
    "there is , till date , no quasar detected with @xmath206 , though there are galaxies which have been detected at @xmath207 ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and it is quite likely that quasars may be detected in the near future . at present",
    "one thus typically uses theoretical models which correctly predict the observed quasar abundance and evolution at @xmath208 to predict the expected number of detectable quasar bubbles at higher redshifts , though these predictions are highly model dependent and uncertain @xcite .",
    "predictions based on the cdm merger driven model @xcite indicate that we expect @xmath209 ionized bubble of comoving radius @xmath210 mpc around an active quasar in @xmath211 degree@xmath212 and @xmath213 mhz volume .",
    "this means that the probability of a detection is less than @xmath197 in a single random gmrt observation volume ( @xmath214 degree@xmath212 and @xmath215 mhz ) at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "including the possibility of fossil bubbles whose quasars have switched off increases the number of bubbles @xcite , and we expect @xmath216 detectable bubbles in a random gmrt observation .",
    "note that , the shape of these fossil bubbles would not be distorted due to the fltt as they have ceased to grow .",
    "the typical size of quasar generated bubbles at @xmath217 is an important factor in matched filter bubble detection .",
    "@xcite predict the comoving radius of quasar generated regions to be @xmath218 mpc at @xmath219 with @xmath220 .",
    "this size is expected to be less at @xmath7 where the global neutral fraction is higher . the typical radius of a galaxy generated bubble is expected to be @xmath214 comoving mpc at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these galaxy generated bubbles outside the quasar generated bubble that is targeted for detection will contribute to the fluctuations in the matched filter estimator @xmath145 .",
    "however , simulations ( paper ii ) indicate that small bubbles of size @xmath221 will not have much impact on detection in the range @xmath222 where a detection is feasible .",
    "finally , we note that there are various other sources of anisotropy such as the spatial fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen distribution due to galaxy generated generated ionized bubbles , anisotropic emission from the quasar itself which have been ignored .",
    "galaxy generated generated ionized bubbles in the surrounding igm can cause significant anisotropies in the quasar generated ionized bubbles .",
    "one needs to use detailed simulation to investigate this which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
