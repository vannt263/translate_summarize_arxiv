    "general relativity assumes that the graviton has zero rest mass . for static gravitational fields a nonzero graviton mass @xmath2 would cause the potential to tend to the yukawa form @xmath3 , effectively cutting off gravitational interactions at distances larger than the compton wavelength @xmath4 of the graviton .",

    "the study of dynamic gravitational fields allows new and independent limits to be placed on the graviton mass .",
    "for example , will @xcite and larson and hiscock @xcite have shown how future observations of gravitational waves may be used to bound the graviton mass via comparison to the dispersion formula @xmath5 here we propose a new technique for limiting @xmath2 using available data on the orbital decay of binary pulsars . consider the hulse - taylor binary pulsar , psr  b1913 + 16 , for which the observed orbital decay attributed to gravitational - wave emission agrees with the predictions of general relativity to approximately @xmath6 .",

    "we now calculate the energy emission rate of compact , slowly moving sources of gravitational waves described by ( [ fieldeqn])([canonical1 ] ) .",

    "the formula ( [ eqn : eloss ] ) for the energy - loss rate of a gravitational - wave source when the graviton is massive is easily applied to the orbital decay of binary systems to put a limit on the graviton mass .",

    "equations ( [ bound ] ) , ( [ eq : f(e)summed ] ) show that a nonzero graviton mass increases the energy emission and decay rate of keplerian binaries , as one would expect from adding extra degrees of freedom to the gravitational field .",
    "the strongest bounds arise from binaries with small eccentricity and large period , as these systems produce the bulk of their radiation at low frequencies @xcite , which are the most sensitive to a graviton mass , as in equation ( [ speed ] ) .    in using ( [ eqn : dl / l ] ) to place an upper limit on the graviton mass",
    ", we should take into account the experimental uncertainties in the fractional discrepancy @xmath51 , which are typically of the same order as @xmath51 .",
    "we assume the measured discrepancy @xmath51 to be normally distributed about its unknown actual value ( given by the equality in ( [ bound ] ) with unknown @xmath55 ) , and with standard deviation as given in table [ tbl : pulsar ] .",

    "these two observations of @xmath55 may also be combined into a single upper bound on the graviton mass by averaging the individual @xmath55 bounds with weight according to their variances . again referring to table",

    "* table x ) , the corresponding limit on the graviton mass from the combined observations of psr  b1913 + 16 and psr  b1534 + 12 is found to be @xmath56",
    "table [ tbl : pulsar ] gives the relevant parameters and the corresponding graviton mass bounds for the two binary pulsars whose gravitational - wave induced orbital decay has been measured , psr  b1913 + 16 and psr  b1534 + 12 @xcite .",
    "these bounds are about two orders of magnitude weaker than the yukawa limit obtained from solar - system observations , @xmath57 @xcite , and several orders of magnitude weaker than that provided by observations of galactic clusters , @xmath58 @xcite , though these galactic cluster bounds may be less robust , owing to their reliance on assumptions about the dark matter content of the clusters . in contrast",
    ", the bound obtained here is very straightforward .",
    "our chief assumption is the form of the effective mass term for the graviton , which , while not unique , is natural .",
    "furthermore , any other mass term would be expected from dimensional arguments to yield similar results .",
    "our other major assumption is that only unbiased measurement errors enter into the determination of the intrinsic binary period decay rate @xmath59 .",
    "the determination of @xmath59 requires an accurate distance measurement to the binary system , however , which can be difficult to make .",
    "the large uncertainty in the discrepancy @xmath51 associated with psr  b1534 + 12 may well be due to an underestimate of the distance to this binary system @xcite , in which case the bound on @xmath60 would be even tighter .",
    "the bound described here arises from the properties of dynamical relativity , making it conceptually independent of either the solar system or galactic cluster bounds on the graviton mass , which are based on the yukawa form of the static field in a massive theory .",
    "furthermore , the bounds from any given pulsar system will improve as observations increase the accuracy of the measured fractional discrepancy in the period derivative .",
