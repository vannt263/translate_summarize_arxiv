    "spintronics is by now a well established field that aims to expand the potential of conventional electronics by exploiting the spin of electrons in addition to their charge @xcite .",
    "the field attracted widespread attention with the proposal of a spin - based field effect transistor by datta and das @xcite in 1990 .",
    "later , the discovery @xcite of exceptionally long spin dephasing times in bulk _ n_-gaas prompted numerous investigations of spin dynamics in gaas based systems . for double - sided quantum wells ( qw ) not doped or with a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg) various studies with optical techniques aimed at understanding the more complex dynamics of 2d electron spin ensembles .",
    "the dependence of spin dephasing times and electron g - factors on parameters such as confinement energy , carrier density and crystal orientation has been investigated @xcite .",
    "heterojunction systems , with a strongly asymmetric qw that contains a high - mobility 2deg , also have long attracted considerable interest .",
    "these systems provide the highest values for electron mobility . further",
    ", this material is of interest since the qw asymmetry results in a strong and tunable rashba spin - orbit coupling , that can cancel dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling @xcite , and this gives access to control over spin relaxation and dephasing @xcite .",
    "however , most of what is known about electron spin dynamics in these heterostructures was obtained using transport measurements @xcite . complementing this with magneto - optical pump - probe measurements brings",
    "the advantage that spin dynamics can be studied with ultra - high time resolution .",
    "we report here on using time - resolved magneto - optical kerr rotation ( trkr ) @xcite to study the dynamics of spin ensembles in such a heterojunction qw system that contains a high - mobility 2deg .",
    "initial trkr studies on such systems suggest that this may also provide an interesting platform for studying electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet well established in which regimes the kerr response of 2deg electrons can be reliably isolated from other contributions to the kerr signal .",
    "the reason is that such multilayered gaas / algaas heterostructures have several gaas layers that have an identical value for the gap .",
    "this results in optical readout signals that contain contributions from ( photo - excited ) electron populations in several layers .    for our heterostructure",
    ", three different layers can contribute to the observed kerr signals from electron spins : the 2deg layer , the bulk epitaxial _",
    "i_-gaas layer that forms the heterojunction and the _ i_-gaas substrate .",
    "the response of these three layers occurs at nearly the same photon energy , hindering discrimination of layers by tuning the laser photon energy when using very short pulses .",
    "we exploit , instead , that one can use differences in the g - factor to isolate the signal from each population .",
    "the g - factor depends on the electron kinetic energy @xmath0 ( with respect to the bottom of the conduction band ) , which can be approximated as @xmath1 where for bulk gaas @xcite @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for 2deg electrons these parameters",
    "were reported @xcite as @xmath4 and @xmath5 . due to band filling by ( photo)electrons , the g - factor thus shifts with an increase of the ( quasi-)fermi level as well .",
    "a related consequence is that the g - factors shifts towards less negative values with increasing the degree of confinement in a qw ( possibly with an increased shift from wavefunctions penetrating algaas barriers ) .",
    "however , it is not obvious that discrimination by g - factors can be applied without accounting for electron momentum relaxation and the intermixing of the populations in different layers @xcite during the evolution of spin dynamics .",
    "our measurement technique relies on using a pump pulse which inserts optically - oriented electron - spin populations well above the bottom of the conduction band , and subsequent momentum relaxation and diffusion of carriers can result in intractable kerr signals .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that one can define situations and regimes ( defined by pump intensity ) where the three spin populations can be studied without being hindered by these effects .",

    "iii the conduction bands of the two materials bend , forming a potential well in layer ii where the 2deg is formed.,width=264 ]    the g - factor of the 2deg is well separated from that of the bulk layers , and our results show that the 2deg population can be studied as a independent population when the density of photo - excited carriers does not exceed the 2deg electron density from doping .",
    "the g - factor for the two bulk layers , on the other hand , is the same so a different approach is needed to distinguish the signal originating from each .",
    "here we use that our heterostructure contains a barrier that blocks carrier diffusion between the two bulk _ i_-gaas layers .",
    "the effect of this is that the carrier density in the layer closest to the surface reaches a higher average value .",
    "the effective g - factor for the uppermost _",
    "i_-gaas layer then acquires a less negative value ( eq .",
    "[ eq : gfactorvse ] ) than that of the underlying substrate .",
    "this can be applied in a regime where the density of photo - excited carriers exceeds the 2deg electron density from doping , and under these conditions the signal from the 2deg is suppressed by strong band filling in the 2deg layer .    in section  [ sec : methods ] of this article we discuss the experimental methods and sample materials that we used .",
    "results are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "there , we first compare the kerr response of our heterostructure to that of well - characterized @xcite bulk _ n_-gaas material that is probed under identical conditions in our setup , and we highlight the differences .",
    "next , we show that the response from the heterostructure can always be described as a superposition of signals from two independent electron populations , and we confirm that this is true for both the kerr signals and for time - resolved reflectance signals that give insight in carrier dynamics of the populations",
    ". measurements of spin dynamics are then analyzed in both the time and frequency domain , confirming that it is possible to treat the different electron populations as independent . in order to confirm that we correctly assign each of the observed g - factors to a particular population in the heterostructure we study how the g - factor , spin dephasing time , and carrier lifetime of each population depend on pump - photon density and temperature .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] presents a summary of the main findings and conclusions .",
    "in a semiconductor , a laser pulse can promote electrons from valence - band states to conduction - band states . in a iii - v semiconductor like gaas ,",
    "such transitions obey well - defined selection rules .",
    "if the laser pulse is linearly polarized , the number of photo - excited electrons with their spin parallel to the beam s propagation direction equals the number of photo - excited electrons with their spin antiparallel to the beam s direction .",
    "if the laser pulse is circularly polarized , the number of photo - excited electrons with spin aligned along the beam s direction will exceed by 3 to 1 the number of electrons with spin aligned in the opposite direction ( and vice versa for the opposite light helicity ) @xcite .",
    "a circularly polarized laser pulse can therefore generate a non - equilibrium population of spin polarized electrons in the conduction band of gaas .",
    "this process is known as optical spin orientation .    in trkr experiments , optical spin orientation with an ultrashort pump pulse",
    "is followed by optical spin probing with a weaker laser pulse with linear polarization that is reflected on the sample .",
    "an unequal filling of the spin - up and spin - down conduction bands produced by the pump pulse gives rise to a transient difference in the absorption coefficient for right and left circularly polarized light ( rcp and lcp respectively ) . through kramers - kronig relation",
    "this also gives rise to a difference in the refractive index for rcp and lcp light .",
    "such a difference in the refractive index gives a rotation of the linear probe polarization upon reflection on an interface of the sample , given that the linear polarization is a superposition of rcp and lcp light .",
    "this process is known as kerr rotation , and the kerr rotation angle @xmath7 ( for probing with a certain photon energy ) is proportional to the expectation value for spin orientation parallel to the propagation direction of the incident probe beam .",
    "the kerr rotation is strongest when the probe photon energy is near resonance with transitions to the states with unequal spin filling , but its magnitude and sign depend on the detuning with respect to exact resonance @xcite , and interference effects and additional faraday rotations in systems with reflections from multiple interfaces @xcite .",
    "note that trkr signals thus predominantly reflect the properties of electrons at the quasi - fermi level of the photo - induced electron population .",
    "in addition to rotation , the reflected pulse may have obtained a certain degree of ellipticity , known in this case as kerr ellipticity . in our experiments we study the reflected probe with a polarization bridge with balanced photodetectors @xcite .",
    "the recorded signal is then proportional to the kerr rotation , while kerr ellipticity and reflectance changes give only third order corrections .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic]a depicts the configuration of the experimental setup with pump and probe beams incident on the sample , and the rotated linear polarization of a reflected probe pulse .",
    "a trkr trace is obtained by plotting the kerr rotation angle @xmath7 of the reflected probe pulse as a function of the time delay between the pump and probe pulse ( see for example fig .  [",
    "fig : bulkand2deg ] ) .    in the presence of an in - plane external magnetic field ( perpendicular to the initial orientation of the optically pumped spins ) , the injected spins precess around the field at the larmor frequency @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron g - factor , @xmath11 is the bohr magneton , @xmath12 is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field , and @xmath13 is the reduced planck constant . in trkr",
    "traces this spin precession appears as oscillations of the kerr angle at the larmor frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bulkand2deg]b ) .",
    "such traces can thus be used for determining the electron g - factor with eq .",
    "[ eq : larmorfreq ] .",
    "we characterize the transient nature of trkr traces with a kerr signal decay time @xmath14 .",
    "note that this can be shorter than the spin dephasing time @xmath15 for an electron ensemble .",
    "we restrict the use @xmath15 for the case that the number of optically oriented electrons in the probe volume is constant .",
    "when this number is decreasing in time at a rate @xmath16 due to processes as electron - hole recombination or diffusion out of the probe volume , the kerr signal decays according to @xmath17 ( an exception to this rule applies to electron doped systems , where kerr signals can live longer than the recombination time @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath14 from measuring trkr traces at @xmath18 or from studying the envelope of oscillatory signals at @xmath19 . in such trkr traces , hole spins only contribute to the signal at very short pump - probe delays ( up to @xmath20 ) , because ensembles of hole spins dephase very rapidly @xcite .",
    "thus , our trkr measurements predominantly represent electron spin dynamics .    200  ps ) in the kerr oscillations measured at 7 tesla on the 2deg sample ( plot d ) . comparing plots ( a ) and ( c )",
    "also clearly shows a slow increase of the kerr signal for the 2deg sample for delays in the range 0 to 100  ps ( also present in the 7 tesla data ) .",

    "is used . in this way",
    ", no net spin polarization is generated .",
    "subsequently , a collinearly polarized probe pulse is incident on the sample .",
    "the pump - induced changes in sample reflectance are measured by comparing the intensity of the reflected probe pulse in the presence and absence of a preceding pump pulse .",
    "this method thus probes the presence of pump - induced electrons and holes at energies that are resonant with the probe photon energy , as a function of pump - probe delay . in time",
    ", photo - excited electrons and holes relax to the lowest available states , and electrons and holes recombine .",
    "this brings the sample reflectance back to its equilibrium value .",

    "layer i is a ( 001 ) oriented @xmath23-gaas substrate . on this substrate",
    "a multilayer buffer consisting of ten periods of alternating gaas ( 5.2  nm ) and alas ( 10.6  nm ) layers was grown to smoothen the surface and to trap unintentional impurities .",
    "layer ii , the accumulation layer , consist of 933.0  nm of undoped gaas . a spacer layer ( iii )",
    "is formed by 36.8  nm of undoped al@xmath24ga@xmath25as grown on top of the accumulation layer .",
    "the donor layer ( iv ) consists of 71.9  nm of si - doped al@xmath24ga@xmath25as with @xmath26 dopants/@xmath27 .",
    "the heterostructure is capped with 5.5  nm of @xmath28-gaas .",
    "the two algaas layers have a bandgap that is larger than all the photon energies that we used in our experiments .",
    "due to quantum confinement the @xmath29  nm gaas layers of the multilayer buffer and capping layer also only have optical transitions at energies above the photon energies that we use .    in this material a 2deg is formed since dopant electrons from the donor layer ( iv ) reduce their energy by relaxing into the conduction band of he narrow bandgap accumulation layer ( ii ) .",
    "these excess carriers are held at the interface by electrostatic attraction from the ionized donors .",
    "the conduction band of the accumulation layer is pulled below the fermi level only for a @xmath3015  nm wide layer near the interface , which results in the 2deg at this position ( estimate obtained from solving the coupled 1d poisson - schrdinger equations for the heterostructure @xcite ) .",
    "electron transport experiments on the 2deg at 4.2  k , after illumination , gave @xmath31 for electron mobility , and @xmath32 for the electron density .",
    "we obtained nearly identical values with optical studies on our 2deg material @xcite .",
    "n_-gaas reference material we used had a doping concentration of @xmath33 .",
    "several experiments on this material have shown that at this doping concentration very long spin dephasing times can be obtained with kerr studies , and the dependence of spin dephasing times on various experimental conditions has been characterized @xcite .",
    "the measurement setup comprises a magneto - optical flow cryostat , pulsed laser , polarization optics , and detection system .",
    "sample temperatures are varied between 4.2 k and 100 k in the flow cryostat .",
    "the cryostat is equipped with a superconducting magnet used to apply fields up to 7 tesla .",
    "the magnetic field is set parallel to the plane of the sample while the laser pulses are incident normal to the sample plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]a .",
    "we used two different pulsed laser systems .",
    "most of the presented results were obtained with a cavity - dumped mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( further named laser 1 ) with 15 fs pulses corresponding to a fixed spectrum extending from 740  nm to 880  nm , ( repetition rates ranging from 4  mhz to 80  mhz ) .",
    "this allows for wavelength tuning with 10  nm bandpass interference filters .",
    "the central wavelength for both pump and probe beam can thus be chosen independently .",
    "after filtering , the pulse spectrums have a significant amplitude in a 19  mev window .",
    "the filters are followed by prism compressors to ensure pulse durations with a full width at half maximum of approximately 120 fs at the sample . unless stated otherwise , we present measurements from using laser 1 with the pump and probe pulse wavelengths centered at 780  nm and 820  nm respectively .",
    "we reproduced most results in a setup with a tunable ti : sapphire laser ( further named laser 2 ) with @xmath30150  fs pulses at 80  mhz repetition rate .",
    "the spectrum of pulses is wider than fourier - transform limited , with significant amplitudes over a @xmath3015  mev window . with this",
    "laser pump and probe pulses were always centered at the same wavelength .    in each case , two beams derived from the laser are used as pump and probe with power ratio 24:1 or 4:1 .",
    "we checked that all our results were at intensities below the regime where saturation effects occur : kerr signals were always proportional to both the pump and probe intensity , and the probe was always non - invasive in the sense that the observed decay times did not depend on probe intensity .",
    "we report the intensity of pump pulses in units of photons/@xmath34 per pulse , because it has relevance with respect to the two - dimensional electron density from doping .",
    "note that this is the number of photons that is incident on the sample surface , and that the number is lower inside the sample due to reflection on each interface of the heterostructure .",
    "glan - thompson polarizers on both pump and probe beam lines are used to produce well defined polarizations .",
    "the pump - probe delay is varied using a retro - reflector mounted on a stepper - motor driven translation stage .",
    "the two beams are focused on the sample with a 25 cm focal length spherical mirror which gives spots with a diameter of approximately 150  @xmath35 full - width at base level .    in order to measure the transient kerr rotation of the sample , a photo - elastic modulator ( pem )",
    "is used to modulate the polarization of the pump beam between rcp and lcp at a rate of 50 khz .",
    "besides improvement of signal - to - noise , this is crucial for avoiding dynamical nuclear polarization effects @xcite , and it rules out phase offsets in kerr signals from interference effects in case of reflections from multiple interfaces @xcite .",
    "the probe beam remains linearly polarized .",
    "the reflected probe is analyzed with a polarization bridge , which decomposes the probe beam into two orthogonal polarizations with a half - wave plate and a wollaston prism , and which detects both these components with a pair of balanced photodetectors .",
    "this bridge is tuned to give a zero difference signal from the two detectors for probe pulses with zero kerr rotation , and this difference signal is recorded with lock - in detection at the pem frequency . for measurements with overlapping pump and pulse spectrums , we employed a double modulation technique by adding an optical chopper in the probe beam ( at @xmath361  khz ) and recording a side band at @xmath37 from the 50 khz pem frequency .",
    "in both cases , the signal is proportional to the kerr rotation angle @xmath7 .    with this setup it is possible to measure transient reflectance ( @xmath38 ) and trkr under identical conditions .",
    "for @xmath38 measurements the pump and probe beams have parallel linear polarizations .",
    "the reflected probe beam is now sent directly to a single photodetector , while the pump beam is modulated using an optical chopper .",
    "modulations of the reflected probe intensity at the chopping frequency are then recorded with lock - in techniques .",
    "this gives a signal that is proportional to pump induced reflectance change of the sample .      before discussing the experimental data it is useful to discuss a hierarchy of timescales that is relevant for interpreting our results .",
    "the electron spin dynamics occurs at time scales of tens to hundreds of picoseconds .",
    "for example , the larmor precession period of electrons is of the order of 25  ps at 7  tesla , and we observe electron spin dephasing times for the 2deg in the range of 100  ps .",
    "the duration of the pump and probe pulses ( approximately 120 fs ) therefore provide sufficient time resolution to resolve all important spin dynamics .",
    "hole spins dephase within @xmath305 picoseconds @xcite .",
    "thus , the kerr signal after a few picoseconds contains information about electron spins only .",
    "most of the data shown uses delay steps of @xmath39  ps with delays up to 1 ns , which allows us to capture all relevant dynamics of electron spins .",
    "the timescales of other electron and hole relaxation processes are very diverse , ranging from a few tens of femtoseconds to nanoseconds .",
    "we typically use a pump pulse with the photon energy centered at 780  nm , pumping electrons in gaas layers at about 63  mev above the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "this leaves a non - equilibrium and non - thermal carrier distribution in the conduction and valence bands of the gaas layers . within the first hundreds of femtoseconds , conduction band electrons ( and valence band holes ) thermalize into a fermi - dirac distribution with a carrier temperature that is much higher than the lattice temperature .",
    "subsequently , electrons cool towards the lattice temperature .",
    "the initial cooling of electrons @xcite , with excess kinetic energy of more than 10  mev occurs very rapidly due to rapid momentum relaxation ( within 10  ps ) .",
    "once the excess kinetic energies drop below @xmath40  mev , further electron cooling slows down to a decay time of approximately 100  ps depending on electron density .",
    "note however , that we use probe pulses with about 19  mev spectral width , with the probe spectrum centered at 820  nm , just below the bottom of the conduction band of gaas .",
    "consequently , most electrons relax into the spectral window of the probe within 10  ps , and the final cooling stage in the time interval from 10 to 100  ps has little influence on our kerr and reflectance signals .",
    "thus , the fast carrier thermalization and initial cooling allows for pumping the sample with high - energy photons ( convenient for blocking of pump light that scatters into the probe channel by spectral filtering , and it ensures that the penetration depth of pump light for the top gaas layers is less than @xmath41 ) .",
    "right after a pump pulse , there will be a steep gradient in the photo - electron density along the direction of the pump over the length of the penetration depth .",
    "this equilibrates by electron diffusion along the beam direction . in the accumulation layer",
    "this takes place within the first 50  ps for high pump intensities , but may occur much slower @xcite for low pump intensities . for our spot sizes , electron diffusion into directions perpendicular to the laser beam propagation does not significantly change the electron density profile .",
    "other carrier processes that take place in timescales between 1  ps and 1  ns are exciton formation and carrier recombination . within the first hundred picoseconds electrons and holes",
    "form excitons .",
    "this implies a further reduction of the initial energy of the photo - excited electrons by a few mev , but this occurs within the spectral window of our probe , and these processes do therefore not strongly influence our @xmath38 and trkr traces .",
    "electron - hole recombination , on the other hand , is directly visible in @xmath38 measurements .",
    "obviously , recombination also results in loss of kerr signal , especially in undoped samples or under conditions where the photo - excited electron density exceeds the electron density due to doping @xcite . with time- and spectrally - resolved photoluminescence",
    ", we measured that the exciton recombination time for our 2deg sample at 4.2 k is greater than 2  ns in the accumulation layer , while it is approximately 360  ps for the substrate @xcite . both of these timescales become shorter with increasing pump intensity . as a function of temperature the 2deg recombination time increases , while it decreases for bulk gaas layers and @xmath28-gaas .",
    "in order to highlight the kerr response that is characteristic for the heterostructure , we compare it to kerr measurements on the bulk _",
    "n_-gaas sample that were obtained under identical conditions .",
    "figure  [ fig : bulkand2deg ] shows in the left column trkr signals from the bulk _",
    "n_-gaas sample .",
    "its kerr signal at 0 tesla closely resembles a mono - exponential decay .",
    "the signal at 7 tesla shows oscillations at the larmor precession frequency for electrons in gaas ( g - factor is @xmath42 @xcite ) , with an envelope that shows again mono - exponential decay @xcite .",
    "the transient trkr signals from the heterostructure , on the other hand , are more complex . at 7 tesla ( fig .",

    "additionally , the envelope shows a slow increase in the delay range from 0 to 100  ps , which is also observed at 0 tesla ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bulkand2deg]c ) .",
    "the _ in - situ _ comparison with bulk @xmath28-gaas material is important for concluding that the observed beatings in trkr traces are characteristic for the heterostructure , given that beatings can also appear in kerr oscillations from @xmath28-gaas under certain measurement conditions @xcite .    the heterostructure data in figs .",
    "[ fig : bulkand2deg]c , d also show a very sharp spike at very short delays , with a decay time of about 3  ps .",

    "it is longer than the duration of pump - probe overlap , and therefore not an optically induced stark effect @xcite .",
    "instead , it occurs at a timescale that is consistent with hole spin dephasing , and hot - electron momentum relaxation .",
    "this part of the kerr signal is therefore possibly influenced by these effects .",

    "this suggests that one can fit the traces in fig .",
    "[ fig : trkrvsfluence]a - c in the time - domain with a superposition of two mono - exponentially decaying cosine functions . that also builds on observations in @xmath28-gaas where trkr signals from single electron population with a single g - factor ( see also fig .",

    "fitting we use @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the pump - probe delay , @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 are , respectively , the kerr signal decay time and the kerr rotation amplitude for each population .",

[ fig : trkrvsfluence]a - c are presented in fig .  [ fig : trkrvsfluence]d - f .",
    "the excellent fits demonstrate that the total signal can be indeed described as being composed of two distinct contributions from two different populations .",
    "we find that we can obtain very good fits assuming two populations only for all pump intensities . a similar approach that assumes three populations",
    "does not improve the fits significantly .",
    "this is a remarkable result , given that the kerr response of our heterostructure does not necessarily split into two distinct contributions .",
    "the continuous character of the accumulation layer ( ii ) from quantum well to bulk epilayer , followed by a bulk substrate , could give more complex signals with signatures of relaxation processes and mixing effects between populations @xcite .",
    "we find that the sign of the amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the two contributions is always opposite ( for @xmath56 and @xmath57 close to zero ) which corresponds to kerr rotations of opposite sign at @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , the slow signal increase at early delays and the beatings in our kerr oscillations have a common origin .",
    "the sign of the kerr response depends on detuning from resonance , but we predominantly probe slightly red - detuned for all populations .",
    "the opposite sign is therefore most likely from interference effects that play a role for the sign of kerr response with reflections from multiple interfaces @xcite .",
    "further evidence that these excellent fits in the time domain indeed reflect that the physics that underlies our kerr signals is that of two independent populations , each with a different but ( nearly @xcite ) constant g - factor , comes from fourier analysis of the traces .",
    "scenario s that include significant spreads or strongly drifting g - factors due to momentum relaxation can be ruled out based on the phase spectrum of fourier transformed trkr signals .",

    "[ eq : fitfunction ] on trkr measurements taken at @xmath114 per pump pulse .",
    "the temperature dependence of the g - factor of population a follows again the trend that was reported for bulk gaas @xcite , and agrees with the high pump - photon density results when accounting for the lower photo - electron density .",
    "the trend for c shows a weaker temperature dependence , in agreement with a weaker dependence on @xmath0 for 2deg electrons ( eq .  [ eq : gfactorvse ] ) .    for the kerr signal decay times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fitparamvstemp]c ) , we found evidence that at 4.2 k the decay rate for both population a and c is dominated by the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) spin dephasing mechanism .",
    "we conclude this from further experiments where our 2deg material was etched into 1.2  @xmath69 m wide wires .",
    "the decay times then show a clear dependence on the crystal orientation of the wire .",
    "this proves that the dp mechanism dominates , with spin - orbit fields that are highly anisotropic in @xmath85-space .",
    "this results from a rashba contribution @xcite to the spin - orbit fields that can cancel the dresselhaus contribution .",
    "the details of this study will appear in a future publication @xcite .",
    "for the 2deg population this conclusion agrees with earlier studies on high - mobility 2degs @xcite . the fact that the decay time for c shows almost no dependence on temperature , indicates that the dp mechanism remains dominant up to 100 k , and that in this low pump - intensity regime the 2deg mobility is not limited by scattering on acoustic phonons for all these temperatures .",
    "the kerr signal decay times for population a are around 40  k longer than the electron - hole recombination times for bulk ( as measured on bulk i - gaas ) .",
    "this provides another indication that population a resides in a layer around the multilayer buffer where electron - hole recombination is suppressed due to band bending .",
    "the increase of the decay time for a when increasing the temperature up to 40  k indicates a suppression of the dp mechanism due to more rapid momentum scattering .",
    "apparently , momentum scattering for this population is due to acoustic phonons . in the range 40  k to 100  k",
    ", the decay times shorten again . here",
    ", the thermal spread in electron kinetic energies @xmath0 becomes important , and results in a spread in g - factor values @xmath83 that increases the precessional dephasing rate .",
    "we have characterized under what conditions it is possible to use time - resolved kerr rotation measurements for studies of electron spin dynamics of 2deg and epilayer ensembles in a gaas / algaas heterojunction system with a high - mobility 2deg .",
    "differences in g - factors of electrons in different layers of the heterostructure allow for discriminating the various populations , and for defining regimes where they behave as independent populations .",
    "this technique can be applied thanks to rapid momentum relaxation processes , which allows for pumping photo - electrons with an excess energy into the conduction band . at high pump - photon densities ( above the 2deg density from doping ) , this is crucial for having pump pulses with a short penetration depth , which ensures that kerr detection is mainly probing electron populations near the wafer surface . at low pump - densities , where 2deg spins can be observed , the excess pump - photon energy is also needed for directly pumping into subbands of the 2deg .",
    "furthermore , we find that having a barrier at about 1  @xmath69 m depth in the accumulation layer facilitates the segregation between kerr signals . at high pump - photon densities",
    "this directly blocks the intermixing of accumulation - layer and substrate populations , and this drives the difference in g - factor . here",
    "the accumulation layer can be studied as a bulk epilayer filled with electrons .",
    "further , since the kerr response is enhanced by reflection on each interface in the heterostructure , the multilayer buffer may also be important at low pump - photon densities for realizing a segregation between the kerr response from electrons in the heterojunction quantum well and electrons around the multilayer buffer .",
    "we analyzed that in our experiments several mechanism contribute to the dephasing of spin - oriented electron populations and the decay of kerr signals , and complete understanding requires further studies .",
    "our results here provide a basis for such further investigations , in particular for the spin dynamics of 2d electron ensembles in heterojunction quantum wells .",
    "an interesting direction is to explore whether confinement of such electron ensembles in micronscale device structures ( as large quantum dots and wires ) can be used to study spin dephasing anisotropy and suppression of spin dephasing due to confinement @xcite .",
    "in addition , continuing our work with a microscope function in the setup allows for studying spin dynamics of 2deg spins in transport channels with very high time resolution and micronscale spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "our results thereby provide a path to performing studies on heterojunction 2deg channels with tunable spin - orbit effects and electron density , which is interesting for work on the datta - das spin - transistor concept @xcite .",
    "notably , we showed that this can also be applied with non - overlapping pump and probe , giving access to exploring correlations between spin dynamics and spin transport .",
    "we thank bernard wolfs , ji liu , and thorsten last for help and useful discussions , and bernd beschoten for providing the bulk @xmath28-gaas sample .",
    "this work was financially supported by the dutch foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) , the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) , and the german programs dfg - sfb 491 , dfg - spp 1285 and bmbf nanoquit .                                                                                                        for the @xmath28-gaas sample and bulk populations in the heterostructure sample ,",
    "we observe g - factors close to @xmath115 . at the highest pump intensities",
    ", however , we observes values up to @xmath116 , as can be expected from band filling ( see .",
    "eq .  [ eq : gfactorvse ] ) . in addition , we observed for such high - pump - intensity traces that this effect diminishes over time scales of the electron - hole recombination times , resulting in weak g - factor drift during a trkr trace that brings the g - factor back towards @xmath42 .",
    "we did not include this in our fitting as with eq .",
    "[ eq : fitfunction ] , since it would give a much higher number of free parameters . however , this drift in - g - factor values only gave small shifts ( @xmath117 ) in the phase of kerr signals .",
    "we checked that the extracted @xmath14 values with our approach were not sigificantly different from fitting results where these effects were included .",
    "the decay time of the kerr signal for @xmath28-gaas is in this measurement substantially shorter than the long values observed in other studies @xcite .",
    "this is due to the high pump intensity , and in exact agreement with the reported dependence on pump intensity @xcite . with our setups we also observed kerr signal decay times well in excess of 5  ns when using lower pump intensities and low fields .",
    "we observe that using phases @xmath118 as free parameters is needed for obtaining good fits .",
    "we also observed this with the @xmath28-gaas reference material ( but not when pumping at low intensities close to the bottom of the conduction band ) .",
    "this contradicts with the expected direction of spin orientation parallel to the pump beam at @xmath58 .",
    "however , we only use data from delays @xmath53  ps for fitting , since holes contribute to the kerr signals up to @xmath119  ps . for @xmath120  ps there is also rapid relaxation of electron kinetic energy @xmath0 . since the effective g - factor has a value closer to zero for higher @xmath0 , early energy relaxation is consistent with apparent phase offsets for @xmath53  ps",
    ". however , full justification of using @xmath118 as free parameters requires further investigation ."
