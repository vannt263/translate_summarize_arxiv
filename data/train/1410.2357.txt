    "radio jet of agn could be produced from either the disk accretion or the black hole ( bh ) spin , or even both .",
    "the accretion produced jet power could be linearly proportional to the product of the eddington ratio and bh mass , as found in radio loud quasars ( * ? ? ? * ( liu & han 2014 ) ) .",
    "whereas , in relative low luminosity agn , e.g. in spiral galaxies , the index of the power law relation between jet power and accretion rate is significantly less than unity , implying that besides the accretion , other mechanisms must be at work in the production of jet , e.g. the bh spin . in this paper , we investigate further in this aspect .",
    "the bh spin can produce jet as suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* steiner et al . ( 2013 ) ) , which principally predicted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) ) , bz - jet hereafter .",
    "the bz - jet depends on the magnetic flux ( @xmath1 ) threading on the bh ergosphere and the spin ( @xmath2 ) of bh , and can be expressed as the function of @xmath2 and relative magnetic flux @xmath3 . the maximum magnetic flux @xmath4 has a root - squared relation with the disk accretion rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( tchekhovskoy et al . 2011 ) ) and see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yuan & narayan ( 2014 ) ) for a review , but it is not clear how the magnetic flux @xmath5 relates to the accretion rate .",
    "we think that a minimum accretion rate is required for the bh spin to produce a jet , since the magnetic flux ( outgoing poynting flux ) needs plasma from the accretion to the bh horizon .",
    "there may also exist a critical accretion rate for the maximum magnetic flux @xmath4 as noted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tchekhovskoy et al . ( 2011 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yuan & narayan ( 2014 ) ) for the bz - jet .",
    "exceeding the critical accretion rate ( or the critical eddington ratio @xmath6 for similar bh masses ) , the bz - jet could be suppressed , and the accretion disk would dominate the behavior of total jet power when the accretion rate is greater than the @xmath6 .    there is a false linear proportional relation between the bz - jet power and the mass accretion rate ( see ( * ? ? ? * yuan & narayan 2014 ) ) , because the @xmath1 in that formula is also a function of the accretion rate .",
    "the relation between the bz - jet power and the mass accretion rate should be a non - linear form which we want to know . to consider both the accretion and the bh spin contribute to jet power",
    ", the total jet power should be the sum of the two but not the multiplying of two contributions .    as the first approximation",
    ", we assume that the jet power is dominated by the accretion at high accretion rate ( e.g. @xmath7 , or @xmath8 for @xmath9 solar mass bh ) , and the jet power is dominated by the bz - jet at lower accretion rate ( @xmath10 , or @xmath11 ) , as noted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* liu & han ( 2014 ) ) . attributing the jet power in the low accretion rate agn to the bz - jet",
    ", this thus implies that the jet power has a flatter spectrum than the accretion - dominated jet versus the accretion rate , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the @xmath12 for the bh spin dominated jet in the seyfert galaxies ( the slope @xmath130.3 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* liu & han 2014 ) ) has a flatter spectrum than the linear proportional relation for the disk accretion - dominated jet power .",
    "the linear proportionality of jet power versus accretion rate is well constrained by the theory proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* liu & han ( 2014 ) ) , and largely consistent with the data as observed in ( * ? ? ?",

    ". however , in the lower accretion regime , the power law slopes are obviously flatter ( @xmath15 ) , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* liu & han ( 2014 ) ) , for radio galaxies and seyferts / liners .",
    "the flatter spectrum is most likely due to that the bz - jet power dominates over the accretion jet power in the low accreting agn .",
    "of course , the bh spin must be high for producing such jet power efficiently , and this implies that most of radio - loud low - luminosity agn may have high - spin bhs , and there are some indications for this in ( * ? ? ?",
