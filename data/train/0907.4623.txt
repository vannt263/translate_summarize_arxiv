    "microcanonical dynamics seems to be a proper mode to describe an isolated system , or its isolated bulk , without any assumption on the equilibrium state between the system and the surrounding .",
    "a typical context where such a dynamics occurs is in the study of transport properties in continuous or discrete models ( see @xcite for general references ) .",
    "for instance , for a system in thermal contact with two heat reservoirs at different temperatures , energy may be exchanged only through the thermostats , and the internal dynamics requires an energy preserving evolution to be implemented in the microcanonical framework ; analogous considerations hold for matter transport and similar items @xcite",
    ".    presently , we are interested in heat transport in discrete models , namely spin systems . as it is well known , for such systems there exist several rules to simulate microcanonical evolution , e.g. the q2r rule introduced by vichniac , the creutz rule and , more recently , the kq rule @xcite .",
    "all of them present some weak aspects which require the introduction of some constraints concerning geometrical support , boundary conditions ( i.e. the allowed range of imposed temperatures ) , connectivity , homogeneity , etc .",
    "our purpose is to introduce a microcanonical dynamics sufficiently flexible to be adapted to all these cases .",
    "the recent interest in systems displaying quenched disorder and inhomogeneous structure , provides indeed a strong motivation for the development of such a general dynamics @xcite .    as it is well known , q2r and creutz dynamics differ in the fact that the latter supplies each site in the lattice with a possible bounded reserve of `` kinetic '' energy , in such a way that the spin flip is allowed not only when the magnetic energy is preserved ( as in q2r ) , but also when the energy excess or defect may be assigned to or extracted from the reserve , so that the _ total _ energy is preserved .",
    "this additional possibility , however , does not solve the dynamical freezing at low energy densities ( occurring of course also in q2r ) , since in such conditions one easily falls into short periodical cycles , inhibiting the transport of heat and the exploration of the whole set of configurations at constant energy .",
    "in other terms , both creutz and q2r dynamics have an ergodicity breakdown at low energy , loosing the independence of initial conditions which is necessary to ensure a statistical effectiveness to the dynamical description .",
    "moreover , one should introduce _ ad hoc _ modifications when the connectivity is not homogeneous .",
    "as to the kq dynamics , introduced and discussed in @xcite , even if it possesses the wanted ergodicity , it is not a satisfying solution to the general dynamical problem , since it is specifically meant for regular lattices .",
    "the new dynamics we are going to define actually modifies the creutz scheme , only maintaining the distinction between magnetic and kinetic energies .",
    "as we shall see , not only it displays effective ergodicity for all practical purposes , but it can also be easily adapted to a wide class of spin systems without any substantial modification , exhibiting therefore the desired versatility .",
    "in particular , it can be implemented on arbitrary topologies , even non regular ones .",
    "another aspect of this flexibility is that the extension to inhomogeneous systems , where the spin coupling is not a constant , is quite natural .",
    "hence , a great variety of disordered models become easily accessible in principle ; in the following we study an example of quenched disorder .",
    "it is worth underlining that , in all the cases considered here , the magnetic and kinetic energies result to be non correlated : this allows a natural definition of temperature at equilibrium , which , in a very natural way , depends only on the average kinetic energy .",
    "this approach can be consistently extended , when far from equilibrium , to a definition of _ local _ temperature .",
    "now , dealing with heat transport , this implies an important improvement in the description of steady states , since not only diffusivity but also conductivity become easily computable . in particular , in studying a model of quenched disorder , the interesting point is to explore how inhomogeneity affects the thermal and transport properties .",
    "for instance , we verify that the conductivity becomes smaller as the disorder grows .",
    "the emergence of non analytical behaviour in the limit of vanishing disorder is also observed .    in the following ,",
    "we first describe in details how our microcanonical dynamics works ( section [ sec : dinamica ] ) and we show that it is able to relax the system to well defined steady states ( section [ sec : checks ] ) , even in the presence of disorder ( section [ sec : disordine ] ) , verifying that a temperature as an intensive quantity independent of the actual values of couplings can still be defined .",
    "then , we focus on the transport properties ( section [ sec : transport ] ) , and on the effect of disorder on the conductivity ( section [ sec : effect ] ) .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusions and final remarks ( section [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "let us consider an ising model defined on a generic network .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3-site spin ; on each link @xmath4 we introduce a local exchange interaction @xmath5 , so that the magnetic energy of a link is @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , on the link @xmath7 we define a local _ kinetic energy _",
    "we remark that while standard creutz scheme specifies a bounded amount of `` kinetic '' energy in each site , we introduce an energy defined on links which is non - negative but , in principle , unbounded .",
    "the dynamical rule proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "start from a distribution of energies @xmath9 ; 2 .",
    "choose randomly a link @xmath10 ; 3 .",
    "extract one over the possible four spin - configurations for the couple of sites @xmath11 , and evaluate the magnetic energy variation @xmath12 induced by the move , where @xmath12 allows for energy variations occurred on the link @xmath10 as well as on those pertaining to links adjacent to sites @xmath3 or @xmath13 ; 4 .",
    "if @xmath14 accept the move and increase the link energy @xmath9 of @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath15 , accept the move and decrease the link energy of @xmath12 only if @xmath16 .",
    "three main points have to be remarked :    * every link is defined by its extremes not only in rectangular lattices but in all graphs , even in the case of variable connectivity .",
    "this ensures a great flexibility with respect to the underlying geometry . *",
    "the interchange between sites and links allows the energy to travel throughout the graph , even at low energy density , without the freezing of the standard creutz - q2r rules or the geometrical restrictions of the kq dynamics . *",
    "the constraint of uniform couplings @xmath17 , typical of previous microcanonical dynamics , can also be relaxed as our dynamics allows to use local ( i.e. non uniform ) spin interactions .",
    "clearly , the above dynamics conserves the total energy given by the following _ hamiltonian _ function @xmath18 where the sum runs over all the links of the network .",
    "notice that energy is locally conserved , namely long - range energy transfers are forbidden and hence we can define our dynamics as microcanonical , where the kinetic energy energy @xmath9 works as an additional degree of freedom . expression ( [ ham ] ) is very general , representing a conserved energy for a model defined on a generic network .",
    "moreover , according to the choice of the couplings @xmath5 , a wide class of models ( disordered interactions , vacancies , spin glasses etc . ) can be recovered .",
    "actually , for comparisons and checks , we consider first the homogeneous system @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 in simulations ) on the standard rectangular lattice of @xmath21 columns and @xmath22 rows , both in the toroidal geometry ( periodical boundaries ) and in the cylindrical geometry with two opposite boundaries .",
    "such boundaries can be `` free '' ( i.e. three neighbours for each site ) or `` open '' ( i.e. in contact with a reservoir ) .",
    "heat conduction in the latter case was studied e.g. in @xcite using q2r - creutz dynamics , in @xcite using kq dynamics and in @xcite using a layer heat - bath .",
    "afterward , we shall study the transport properties in a cylindrical system where the couplings @xmath23 are chosen randomly in the interval @xmath24 $ ] , i.e. a disordered ferromagnet .",
    "at equilibrium , i.e. in a closed system where no energy is injected or subtracted , every move is reversible , and the probability @xmath25 to go from the configuration @xmath26 to the configuration @xmath27 equals @xmath28 .",
    "detailed balance is satisfied , and the equilibrium probability distribution is constant over all configurations .    if all the configurations with the same energy are visited in the evolution , the system is ergodic and its equilibrium properties can also be described by boltzmann statistics . in this perspective , we check the agreement between the numerical stationary results and the boltzmann distribution , focusing first on the homogeneous system @xmath19 defined on a two - dimensional torus ; a positive response to the check has to be seen as an indication of effective ergodicity .",
    "a first step in this direction consists in testing the decorrelation between the kinetic energy @xmath9 and the magnetic energy @xmath29 of a link .",
    "indeed , we verify that for each link @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes a time average along our dynamics .",
    "kinetic and magnetic part of the hamiltonian can therefore be treated separately .    as a second point",
    ", we observe that the link energy satisfies the boltzmann distribution @xmath32 , where the fitted constant @xmath33 is naturally the inverse temperature of the system ( fig .",
    "[ distributions ] , left - panel ) . in general , for the homogeneous system we can write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an integer and @xmath36 is a constant depending on the initial conditions ; since @xmath36 does not have any influence , hereafter we set @xmath37 .",
    "notice that the factor @xmath38 multiplying @xmath39 is due to the fact that the minimal amount of exchanged energy is @xmath40 ( @xmath9 derives from @xmath12 and , apart from possible borders , in rectangular lattices the coordination number is even ) .",
    "the equilibrium temperature has been verified to be independent from the initial distribution of energies and from the particular link considered , as expected from an intensive quantity .",
    "averages on the links are possibly used only to accelerate the numerical convergence .    the simplest way to evaluate the temperature from the above distribution",
    "is to relate @xmath41 with the average link - energy , obtaining @xmath42 which may be easily inverted to get @xmath43 : @xmath44    in a subsequent check , we verify that @xmath45 given by formula ( [ emdis2 ] ) is the temperature even for the magnetic variables of the system .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ cilindro ] evidences that the average magnetic energy @xmath46 and its fluctuations @xmath47 are the same in the microcanonical system at temperature @xmath48 given by eq .",
    "[ emdis2 ] and in a two - dimensional ising model in equilibrium at temperature @xmath48 .",
    "equivalent results are also obtained introducing thermostats at the boundaries of the microcanonical system ( fig.[cilindro ] ) .",
    "the coupling between system and thermostats is imposed by extracting the link energies at the borders every time - step according to the probability distribution @xmath49 .",
    "we remark that in presence of such thermostats the whole system equilibrates at temperature @xmath50 , independently of the initial conditions , proving the reliability of such a simple model for thermostats .",
    "energy transport is naturally introduced by imposing different temperatures at the boundaries .",
    "then , whenever a stationary state is reached , equation ( [ emdis2 ] ) provides a simple definition of local temperature . clearly , along the same column all energies and temperatures are expected to be equal , as they are in fact .",
    "the consistency of this definition of local non - equilibrium temperature has been further verified by showing that , at the same @xmath48 , the local magnetic energy for a link is the same at equilibrium or in the presence of transport ( fig . [ cilindro ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", the homogeneous system follows a quasi equilibrium picture consistent with the results given by the kq dynamics @xcite .",
    "the remarkable difference is that , in the present case , the existence of a local kinetic energy allows a natural definition of temperature , without any reference to the equilibrium magnetic model .",
    "after testing our dynamics for the ising model on a regular lattice with homogeneous coupling , we exploit the fact that , as anticipated , this dynamics is naturally defined even in more complex situations , e.g. when the underlying topology or the interaction couplings @xmath5 are not homogeneous . here",
    "in particular we focus on the case of a 2-dimensional rectangular lattice where the coupling @xmath5 are randomly chosen from a uniform distribution in an interval , i.e. @xmath51 $ ] , @xmath52 ; hence , @xmath53 is an index of disorder , being the average magnetic interaction fixed and equal to @xmath54 .",
    "first of all , we study the differences at equilibrium between homogeneous and disordered systems . to this purpose , using the standard metropolis dynamics , we evaluate the critical temperature @xmath55 by means of binder cumulant techniques @xcite . figure ( [ binder ] )",
    "shows the value of the critical temperature as a function of the disorder @xmath53 .",
    "we note that @xmath55 is slightly lowered by the presence of disorder .",
    "let us now consider the new dynamics for the disordered system .",
    "with respect to the homogeneous case @xmath56 , the main difference is that the link energy is not of the form @xmath57 with @xmath35 integer .",
    "indeed , the kinetic energy on the link @xmath10 can be written as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 are integers and the sum @xmath61 runs over @xmath7 and its six neighbouring links .",
    "hence , in the sum there are seven different real numbers @xmath62 randomly chosen in @xmath24 $ ] and , if all the combinations of integers @xmath60 are realized in the dynamical evolution , the values of @xmath9 can be considered densely distributed along the positive real axis ( see appendix ) .",
    "therefore , under the hypothesis of ergodicity we expect that the probability density for link energies is @xmath63 , with @xmath64 a real number . in figure ( [ distributions ] )",
    "we check indeed that in a random system the link energies are distributed according to a continuous exponential function .",
    "also in this case , as in ( [ emdis ] ) , the temperature can be related to the average kinetic energy , in particular for a continuous variable we have @xmath65 once again , the constant @xmath66 is the temperature @xmath48 and the link ( kinetic ) energy equals the system temperature .",
    "we check that , although the system is inhomogeneous , the temperature is the same for all the sites , as expected at equilibrium , and also that @xmath67 is a consistent definition of temperature even for the magnetic system , as analogously verified for the homogeneous system ( see fig .",
    "[ cilindro ] ) .",
    "therefore , the temperature is the parameter governing the equilibration of the system . in particular , at equilibrium different parts of an inhomogeneous system may display different behaviours but @xmath48 is constant in the whole sample .",
    "for example , if a part of the system is characterized by constant coupling @xmath68 while in the rest @xmath5 is chosen randomly , the local kinetic energy is described by discrete and continuous distributions in the different regions respectively . however , the temperature is the same in both .",
    "analogously in a free cylinder ( isolated borders ) with constant coupling @xmath69 , we have that the border sites exchange energy with an odd number of neighbours .",
    "the minimal amount of exchanged energy is therefore @xmath70 instead of @xmath40 , giving a different discrete distribution for sites in the bulk and at the border .",
    "however , we have numerically verified that the temperature does not change .",
    "thus , in general , for systems with random - incommensurate couplings , equation ( [ emcon ] ) provides a good definition of temperature .",
    "this definition can naturally be extended to the case when different temperatures are imposed at the boundary thermostats , i.e. in the presence of gradients ( @xmath71 ) and heat transport , as described in the next section .",
    "as previously explained , our system satisfies the boltzmann distribution @xmath72 , so that in order to fix a temperature @xmath73 on a given set of links , it is sufficient to extract the relevant link energies according to the distribution @xmath74 , and this is sufficient to establish a consistent coupling between the system and the thermostats . in the following we consider a cylindrical ising system with boundaries coupled to two thermostats at temperatures @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , and we study the transport properties .",
    "first of all , we verify that in the steady state the kinetic energy @xmath77 is still well defined on each link .",
    "however , in such a non - equilibrium situation , it varies from link to link ; hence , hereafter we use @xmath77 as a definition of _ local _ temperature @xmath78 .",
    "we also notice that once the distance from the thermostats is fixed , its spatial fluctuations increases with @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the dependence displayed by @xmath78 on the magnetic coupling @xmath5 is very small for @xmath53 not too large .",
    "now , in the presence of temperature fluctuations also transport is expected to display non trivial spatial patterns arising from the interplay between non - equilibrium and disorder . as a first step in studying such a complex phenomenology",
    "we investigate how disorder affects the average transport properties .",
    "in particular we introduce the column temperature @xmath79 and magnetic energy @xmath80 obtained by spatially averaging over all @xmath3 s @xmath78 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the emerging cylindrical symmetry makes @xmath13 the only gradient variable , and in this situation the simplest model for heat transport is provided by the one - dimensional fourier equation , where , as usual , the column index @xmath13 will be treated as a continuous variable @xmath82 : @xmath83 notice that @xmath84 is the specific total energy in column @xmath13 , namely @xmath85 , and that @xmath86 is the conductivity which is expected to depend only on the local temperature and on the system parameters ( @xmath69 and @xmath53 in this case ) .",
    "indeed , in the following we verify that energy transport can be studied by means of equation ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) , and we also evaluate @xmath86 as a function of @xmath48 , evidencing the effect of disorder .    in the stationary state , when @xmath87 , we call @xmath88 the total amount of heat crossing any given surface , so that @xmath89 represents the heat flux which can be measured , for instance , from the energy absorbed per unit of time by the thermostat . as shown in @xcite , we have @xmath90 clearly @xmath86 represents the proportionality constant between the temperature gradient and the flowing heat energy . similarly , the diffusivity of the magnetic energy can be defined as : @xmath91 it is worth underlining that while @xmath92 can be obtained directly from the magnetic energy @xmath93 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : diff4 ] ) for the conductivity @xmath86 we need a measure of the temperature @xmath48 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : diff3 ] ) . for this reason",
    "kq dynamics , dealing exclusively with the magnetic energy , allows for the computation of diffusivity , while here we are able to easily estimate both quantities .    introducing the magnetic specific heat @xmath94 , a comparison of eq .",
    "[ eq : diff3 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : diff4 ] provides the simple relation @xmath95 notice that @xmath96 is an equilibrium quantity well known for the ising model .",
    "we have measured conductivity for the ordered system with @xmath97 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ) as well as for the disordered system with fixed @xmath98 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] ) . in both cases",
    "we found a very good collapse of data pertaining to different temperatures intervals and sizes .",
    "this provides a strong confirmation of the picture above based on a fourier transport equation with a temperature ( energy ) dependent conductivity ( diffusivity ) .",
    "in particular , we notice that the curve for the conductivity exhibits a maximum at a temperature @xmath99 slightly larger than the critical temperature @xmath55 which corresponds to a peak in the specific heat and to a minimum for the diffusivity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] ) .",
    "as observed also in @xcite , we expect that in the thermodynamic limit the diffusivity goes to zero logarithmically , consistently with the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat , so that the conductivity is not expected to diverge at the critical point @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , from both fig .  [ fig_4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] , we notice that as the temperature is increased , the rate of growth ( for @xmath100 ) and of decrease ( for @xmath101 ) displayed by the conductivity are sensitively different .",
    "this point can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] and recalling eq .",
    "[ eq : d_k ] : at small temperatures the diffusivity remains finite , while the specific heat is close to zero .",
    "let us now deepen our knowledge of how the conductivity is affected by disorder @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] we show data for conductivity vs. temperature for different degrees of disorder .",
    "remarkably , the figure highlights a clear drift : as the disorder @xmath53 increases the conductivity @xmath86 gets lower for any value of the local temperature .",
    "hence , for a given system characterized by the set of parameters @xmath102 the heat flow @xmath103 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath53 , or , otherwise stated , the presence of disorder lowers the transport efficiency .",
    "we now focus on the behaviour for @xmath1 .",
    "the transition from the ordered to the disordered case is in fact characterized by different expressions of the kinetic energy as a function of the temperature ( see eqs .",
    "[ emdis2 ] ,  [ emcon ] ) .",
    "this could be a signal of a non trivial behaviour also for different physical quantities .",
    "a plausible ansatz for a singularity at sufficiently small @xmath53 is provided by the expansion : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is expected to depend in general on the system parameters ( size , gradient @xmath106 , etc ) and @xmath107 is a possibly universal exponent . in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] we show a log - log scale plot for @xmath108 which confirms the scaling law of eq .  [ eq : expansion ] over a wide range of disorder and for different choices of temperature intervals .    by means of a fitting procedure it is possible to get estimates for @xmath109 and @xmath107 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath109 increases with the temperature gap @xmath110 , and its value is significantly smaller when both temperatures are larger than the critical one , namely @xmath111 .",
    "hence , as expected , the effect of disorder is especially appreciable for low temperatures .",
    "we also notice that , within the error , the agreement among the exponents @xmath107 is rather good .",
    "finally , we remark that when @xmath112 and both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are smaller than @xmath55 the decorrelation time are long and the measures of @xmath103 and @xmath107 , the relevant exponent , get awkward . indeed , the `` critical slowing down '' observed for @xmath113 is neatly distinct from the behaviour at @xmath114 ( i.e. @xmath97 ) .",
    "this provides a hint on a possible non analiticity as @xmath1 .",
    "we have introduced a microcanonical dynamics based on the link reserves of kinetic energy , showing that it recovers the results on regular lattices previously obtained by other dynamics and that , moreover , it can be properly applied to disordered systems and it lets a natural definition of temperature , also when far from equilibrium .",
    "this allows an easy access to such quantities as conductivity and specific heat , otherwise difficult to define operationally .",
    "we measured the average conductivity for the ordered and the disordered systems showing that the presence of disorder reveals in the reduction of the transport efficiency .",
    "the disordered lattice exhibits remarkable additional features : there are indications for a singular behaviour of the system in the limit @xmath115 of the disorder parameter .",
    "the reason of such a singularity may lie in the numerical strain in filling the reals by combinations with integer coefficients if the couplings @xmath5 are very close to each other .",
    "this slowing down should be the dynamical counterpart of the discontinuity of the temperature ( see expressions ( [ emdis ] ) and ( [ emcon ] ) ) when the @xmath116-width of the disorder interval tends to zero .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to highlight the nature of the exponent @xmath107 , which describes how the heat flow decreases with @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , it should be clarified whether @xmath107 depends on the system parameters @xmath117 or , if not , whether it depends on the particular dynamics chosen .",
    "recalling from past experiments that the sole presence of gradients proved influent on the fluctuations of physical and geometrical observables @xcite , on the basis of present results it seems likely that there are other problems deserving future investigations , e.g. the fine interplay between disorder and non - equilibrium in small scale regions , where local heat flows and temperature fluctuations interact presumably in non trivial ways .",
    "in other words , for the disordered system we have verified the effectiveness of the fourier approach by considering averaged quantities , while the validity of such a description at the microscopic scale is still an open problem .    finally , we underline that the dynamics introduced here allows possible extensions not only to varied types of disorder ( vacancies , negative couplings , dynamical disorder ... ) or to spin systems lying on different geometrical structures , but also to systems where the gradient maintaining the condition of non - equilibrium is due , for instance , to the contact with reservoirs at different densities @xcite . in general",
    ", it is conceivable to model some peculiar dynamics where `` conservation '' refers to the sum of two distinct populations .",
    "let @xmath118 , with @xmath119 , positive and rationally independent reals .",
    "let @xmath120 .",
    "then , for arbitrarily small @xmath121 , there exists a linear combination with integer coefficients @xmath122 such that @xmath123 .    _ proof  _ : let @xmath124 and @xmath125 be the minimal and the maximal positive reals obtained as integer combinations @xmath126 , where @xmath127 may be @xmath128 .",
    "then define @xmath129 as the greatest positive real @xmath130 of the form @xmath131 with integer @xmath132 .",
    "such a number @xmath129 is an integer combination of the @xmath133 and it does not coincide with @xmath124 because of their rational independence .",
    "we define now @xmath134 observing that necessarily @xmath135 .",
    "now , we iterate the procedure defining @xmath136 and @xmath137 we obtain a positive sequence @xmath138 converging to @xmath139 , because @xmath140 . each term in this sequence is an integer combination of the @xmath133 .",
    "now , we can choose @xmath141 in such a way that @xmath142 . since @xmath143 is finite",
    ", there exists an integer @xmath144 such that @xmath145 we get this way a neighborhood of @xmath146 smaller than @xmath121 , whose extremes are integer combinations of the @xmath133 , qed .",
    "note 2 : with reference to our problem , where the @xmath133 are the seven couplings @xmath147 chosen for each link in an interval @xmath148 $ ] , and the integer coefficients are the iterated additions and subtractions determined by the wandering spin flips , it seems that , especially for great @xmath146 s , the probability of the right approximating combination is extremely low .",
    "however , in the integrals of formula ( [ emcon ] ) , the real variable is weighted in turn by the boltzmann factor , and this explains why also in our finite - time simulations it is possible to to fill densely the relevant part of the real axis , ensuring the correctness of the procedure ;    note 3 : when the @xmath116-width of the interval shrinks ( little disorder ) , this contributes to make difficult the approximation : the reduction in numerical efficiency in these conditions may be observed indeed , as noticed in section ( [ sec : effect ] ) , and it could also be related to the possible singularity of the limit @xmath1 ."
