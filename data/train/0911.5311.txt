    "recently , a bipolar switching phenomenon in tio@xmath0 has been observed @xcite and much work has been done to design superior tio@xmath0-based resistive random access memory ( rram ) devices .",
    "this , together with many other important applications of tio@xmath0 , such as white pigment for paints , sunscreen , high - efficiency solar cells @xcite , and photosplitting of water to hydrogen @xcite , has been stimulating a great deal of research interest in atomistic simulations of tio@xmath0 .",
    "accurate atomistic simulations would provide detailed information at the atomic level that might answer some important open questions , such as the mechanism of bipolar switching .",
    "force fields are the key to accurate atomistic simulations . in the last twenty years , many force fields",
    "have been built for tio@xmath0 @xcite . among these , the partial - charge rigid - ion model of matsui and akaogi ( ma model ) @xcite , and the variable - charge morse stretch ( ms - q ) interatomic potential of swamy@xcite , have been the most successful and popular .",
    "both the ma and ms - q models can describe a series of crystal structures quite well .",
    "a common feature of these force fields is that they were adapted to reproduce experimental bulk properties , such as lattice constants , cohesive energies , bulk moduli and elastic constants .",
    "an alternative parameterization method consists of fitting force fields to forces , energy differences , and stresses extracted from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no such _ ab initio _ force field for tio@xmath0 yet exists .",
    "having a potential that can accurately model the vibrational properties of tio@xmath0 as well as its structures is very important as they determine its finite - temperature macroscopic properties .",
    "the phonon dispersion curves and density of states for rutile tio@xmath0 have been measured by the coherent inelastic scattering of thermal neutrons along principal symmetry directions of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-point phonons have been measured by raman @xcite and infrared @xcite spectroscopy .",
    "in addition to these experimental determinations , phonon frequencies have been calculated _",
    "ab initio_@xcite .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to the determination of phonon properties from a force field for tio@xmath0 , even though it is a very demanding test of a force field s accuracy . as has been demonstrated for mgo@xcite , _",
    "ab initio_-based classical force fields have the potential to give a very good description of phonon properties .",
    "tio@xmath0 has several competing lattice structures and is a more complex oxide than mgo .",
    "it is rather interesting , therefore , to see how well such a force field can predict its vibrational properties .    in this work",
    ", we present a polarizable classical interatomic force field for tio@xmath0 , parameterized from _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we test its accuracy by comparing its predictions of structural properties , equations of state , phonon frequencies , and the temperature dependences of lattice parameters , entropy , free energy , and specific heat under constant volume in the rutile phase with experimental data and with _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we also calculate the structures and relative energies of the brookite and anatase phases to get an indication of the force field s transferability .",
    "the potential energy function @xmath2 that we use to describe interactions between ions consists of a pairwise term @xmath3 describing short - range non - electrostatic interactions and an electrostatic term @xmath4 describing dipole induction and the electrostatic interactions of the charges and induced dipole moments of the ions .    for the short - range interaction energy",
    "we use the pairwise morse - stretch form @xmath5 } -2e^{(\\gamma_{ij}/2 ) [ 1-(r_{ij}/r_{ij}^0)]}\\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the distance between nearby ions @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are parameters that are specific to the pair of species of ions @xmath7 and @xmath8 . this potential",
    "is truncated at a radius of @xmath12 a.u .    the total electrostatic contribution to the energy of the system includes charge - charge , charge - dipole , and dipole - dipole interaction terms : @xmath13   + \\sum_{i,\\gamma } \\frac{(p_i^\\gamma)^2}{2\\alpha_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the charge of ion @xmath7",
    ", @xmath15 is the @xmath16 cartesian component of the dipole moment of ion @xmath7 , @xmath17 is its polarisability , and @xmath18 .",
    "the final term on the right hand side of this equation is a sum of the self energies of the ions .",
    "the self energy of an ion is the internal energy cost of inducing a dipole on it .",
    "there are two mechanisms for the induction of ionic dipole moments .",
    "the first is via the short - range repulsive forces between ions which can distort an ion s electron cloud thereby giving it a dipole moment .",
    "the second is the induction of a dipole moment on an ion by the electric field arising from the charges and the dipole moments of all other ions .    to model the induction by short - range repulsive forces we follow the approach of madden _",
    "et al._@xcite . in their approach",
    ", the contribution of the short - range forces to dipole moments is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are model parameters .",
    "the electrostatically - induced dipole moments are more difficult to calculate because they are all interdependent due to their contributions to , and dependences on , the electric field . at every time step",
    "we find the dipole moments of the ions by iterating to self - consistency the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dipole moment on ion @xmath7 at iteration @xmath25 of the self - consistent cycle ; @xmath26 is the electric field at position @xmath27 .",
    "we use ewald summation to calculate electrostatic energies , forces , stresses , and electric fields .",
    "our model depends on a set of parameters @xmath28 comprising the morse - stretch parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the short - range dipole model , and the charges @xmath34 and polarisabilities @xmath35 of the ions . in section [ section : parameters ] we describe how these parameters are determined .",
    "total energies , stresses , and forces are computed from _ ab initio _",
    "simulations based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "_ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations employing the projector augmented wave method ( paw ) were performed in the nvt ensemble under periodic boundary conditions using the vasp simulation package @xcite .",
    "only the ti ( 3d,4s ) and o ( 2s,2p ) electron states were treated as valence states , however , tests in which the ti ( 3s , 3p ) semicore states were included yielded similar results for the energy differences between crystalline phases and the phonon frequencies of rutile tio@xmath0 .",
    "the local - density approximation ( lda ) to the exchange - correlation energy was used .",
    "the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite with a time step of @xmath36 fs was adopted to solve the equations of motion , and temperature was controlled using a nose - hoover thermostat@xcite .",
    "we used a @xmath37 supercell that contained @xmath38 atoms and only the @xmath1-point was used to sample the brillouin zone .",
    "a kinetic energy cutoff of @xmath39 ev was used in the plane - wave expansion of the wave functions during the md simulations .",
    "the goal of these _ ab initio _ md simulations was simply to produce some reasonable atomic configurations to serve as representative snapshots at finite temperature .",
    "these configurations were then used to perform higher - precision dft calculations of forces , stresses , and energies for use in the force - field parameterization .",
    "we fit our potential to dft calculations in the rutile crystal structure , however , to broaden the range of different environments for the ions , two temperatures are considered in the potential fitting : 300k and 1000k .",
    "furthermore , at each temperature , configurations at more than one volume were chosen . for 300k eight configurations",
    "were used .",
    "six of these configurations are taken from an _ ab initio _ md simulation at the zero temperature equilibrium volume .",
    "the other two were obtained from simulations in which the volume was expanded by 3% . at 1000k",
    ", we used 3 sets of data in total , each containing four configurations .",
    "these three sets are obtained from md simulations at the zero - temperature equilibrium volume , and at volumes expanded by 3% and by 9% . to minimize correlations between configurations ,",
    "successive snapshots were separated from one another by 2 ps of _ ab initio _ md . for each snapshot , we used vasp to calculate the forces , energies and stresses . to obtain these quantities with high precision , the brillouin zone was sampled using a @xmath40 monkhorst - pack @xmath41point mesh and , to converge the forces and the stress tensors properly , a very high wavefunction cutoff energy of @xmath42 ev was used .",
    "the potential parameters were obtained by minimizing the cost function @xmath43 with respect to the parameters @xmath28 where @xmath44 @xmath45 is the @xmath46-component of the force on ion @xmath7 calculated with the classical potential ; @xmath47 is the @xmath46-component of the force on ion @xmath7 calculated _ ab initio _ ; @xmath48 is the stress tensor component calculated with the classical potential ; @xmath49 is the stress tensor component calculated _ ab initio _ ; @xmath50 denotes the number of snapshot configurations used in the fit ; @xmath51 is the bulk modulus ; @xmath52 is the potential energy of configuration @xmath53 for the classical potential , and @xmath54 is its energy calculated _ ab initio_. @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are weights that quantify the relative importances to the fitting cost function of forces , stresses , and energies , respectively . in this work , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "these numbers are somewhat arbitrary as long as the energy differences are given a relatively small weight because we only have one energy per configuration .",
    "we tried different weights and found no significant difference in the final values of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "minimization of @xmath64 is performed by a combination of simulated annealing @xcite and powell minimization@xcite .",
    "the former is used to provide an initial parameter set which brings the cost function to a basin in the surface defined by @xmath64 in @xmath65space .",
    "minimization is then completed using powell s method .",
    "we assume that dft provides accurate atomic forces and energies .",
    "therefore if , at the global minimum of @xmath1 in @xmath65space , @xmath61 remains large it means that the potential model does not contain the ingredients necessary to fit the dft potential energy surface closely .",
    "the model is unphysical or incomplete and the resulting force - field is unlikely to produce results that are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "agreement with experiment can still be found by fitting to experimental data , but when agreement is not attributable to accurate interatomic forces , it is difficult to place confidence in the force - field for calculations that can not be directly checked by comparison with experiment . however , when reliable experimental data is available , simulations are of limited value anyway .",
    "for this reason we deem it important for a force - field to be able to fit dft forces closely and the closeness of the fit achieved in the parameterisation is itself a test of the quality of the potential .",
    "following the fitting procedure described in the previous section , we obtained the force - field parameters for rutile tio@xmath0 , as listed in table [ table : one ] . in this fitting , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "put another way , the root - mean - squared error in the forces is @xmath69 of the root - mean - squared force .    as a comparison",
    "we have checked how close the ma model s forces are to the _ ab initio _ ones .",
    "we find that the root - mean - squared difference between the ma forces and the dft forces is @xmath70 of the root - mean - squared dft forces ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "the ma model uses the pairwise born - mayer potential form and by minimising @xmath1 with respect to the parameters of the born - mayer potential we have been able to achieve a best fit of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "however , this resulted in a disimprovement in the description of the three crystal structures with respect to the ma potential . as one might expect , and as was found previously for silica@xcite , when the fit to _ ab initio _ calculations is poor , the ability of a potential to reproduce experimental results does not correlate with the quality of the fit .",
    "our tests strongly suggest that the born - mayer form provides a poor microscopic description of atomic forces in tio@xmath0 .      in order to check the reliability and transferability of the new force field , we computed the structural properties of three different crystalline polymorphs of tio@xmath0 , namely the rutile , anatase , and brookite structures .",
    "structural optimizations for these three crystals were performed via the steepest - descent method at zero pressure .",
    "the resulting lattice parameters are presented in table [ table : two ] and compared to the _ ab initio _ data calculated with the vasp package and to experimental data@xcite , both at room temperature and ( for rutile and anatase ) at @xmath77 k. both _",
    "ab initio _ calculations and the new force field reproduce experimental data quite well and the accuracy of the force field is comparable to that of dft .",
    "we stress that the force field in this work is only fit to _ ab initio _ data from calculations in the rutile crystal structure .",
    "therefore , its ability to reproduce the structures of anatase and brookite is an indication that it may be reasonably transferable between different structures .",
    "however , apart from the handful of structural and energetic properties presented in this paper , we have not tested the force field in these phases .",
    ".the fitted interatomic force - field parameters ( in atomic units ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have calculated these quantities , which determine long - range forces , with our force field and , in table [ table : z ] , we compare our results to those obtained from dft .",
    "the agreement between our potential and dft is good , therefore our potential should describe long - range forces reasonably well .",
    "the best - fit ionic polarisabilities ( @xmath78 a.u .",
    ", @xmath79 a.u . ) ( table [ table : one ] ) provided by our parameterization process are unusual and worthy of comment .",
    "the polarisability of the oxygen ion is much lower than has been found by force fitting for other oxides such as mgo@xcite and sio@xmath0@xcite , or from electronic structure simulations@xcite .",
    "typically , @xmath80 is between @xmath81 and @xmath77 a.u .. however , most surprising is the large polarizability of the ti ions .",
    "one would expect a small polarizability for a cation , particularly one with such a high positive charge .    by making atoms polarisable ,",
    "we include the response of electrons in a phenomenological way .",
    "however , we only include one response mechanism .",
    "others , such as higher - order polarisabilities and charge - transfer between ions , are certain to exist to some degree .",
    "furthermore , we are using a fully - ionic model while covalent effects might be important .",
    "it seems likely that including one or more of these effects would allow our parameterizer to achieve a closer fit to the _ ab initio _ forces .",
    "we speculate that the strange polarisabilities are an effort by our parameterization program to compensate for those other electronic effects which are not present in the mathematical form of the potential .",
    "it is remarkable , and further evidence of the power of the force - fitting approach , that the parameteriser succeeds in finding values for the charges and polarisabilities of the atoms that perform so well .",
    "figure 3 compares the dependence of the lattice parameters of the rutile structure on temperature with experiment@xcite .",
    "once again , the agreement is very good , indicating that the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface is well reproduced by our force field .",
    "the results reported in figure 3 were from long ( @xmath82 ps ) md simulations of a @xmath83 supercell , which contains @xmath84 atoms .",
    "a time step of @xmath85 fs was used and temperature was controlled with a nose - hoover thermostat@xcite . while atoms moved according to newton s equations ( using a verlet algorithm ) , steepest descent was performed on the cell degrees of freedom .",
    "we verified that this approach gave almost identical results to performing parrinello - rahman constant pressure simulations@xcite and taking averages over the trajectory of the lattice constants .",
    "however , the latter simulations are more time consuming and more difficult to control .",
    "we caution that our simulations treat the ions purely classically and that quantum effects would flatten out these curves at low temperatures .",
    "thermodynamic properties of rutile tio@xmath0 , such as free energy , entropy , and phonon specific heat under constant volume were evaluated in the quasi - harmonic approximation from the phonons using the fropho package @xcite and the results are given in figure [ fig : thermo ] .",
    "we compare the results from dft calculations of the phonons and calculations of the phonons with our force field . in both cases ,",
    "phonons were calculated in @xmath86 supercell .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : thermo](a ) , the temperature dependence of the free energy calculated from the new force field is almost the same as that from our _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "an enlargement of the free energy curve is also superimposed in figure [ fig : thermo](a ) in order to see the difference between these two results more clearly .",
    "the entropy of rutile tio@xmath0 is given in figure [ fig : thermo](b ) .",
    "again , the new force field reproduces the _ ab initio _ calculation extremely well .",
    "figure [ fig : thermo](c ) shows that the specific heat under constant volume ( @xmath87 ) from the new classical force field is also in excellent agreement with our _ ab initio _ calculations . within the debye model @xcite",
    ", @xmath88 can be expressed as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of atoms per cell ( 6 for rutile tio@xmath0 ) , @xmath91 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath92 is the debye temperature . using this expression , the specific heat at @xmath92",
    "can be computed as @xmath93 by comparing this value with our calculation , we can obtain the debye temperature @xmath92 . we find that our _ ab initio _ calculations predict @xmath94 k while our new force field predicts @xmath95 k. these values are very close to the experimental debye temperature of @xmath96 k @xcite .",
    "a new classical force field for tio@xmath0 has been proposed that has been parameterized using forces , stresses , and energies extracted from _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the potential can not only predict the structural properties of tio@xmath0 in three crystal structures , namely , rutile , brookite , and anatase , but also gives the right ground state and the correct energy sequence of these three structures and predicts their bulk moduli with an accuracy comparable to dft .",
    "while the force field has been constructed with rutile in mind , and fit to _ ab initio _ data of the rutile structure , it seems likely to be reasonably transferable to different structures .",
    "however , the most obvious deficiency of the force - field is that it overestimates energy differences between these polymorphs .",
    "this , and the unphysical polarisabilities of the ions , suggest that our functional form may lack ingredients necessary to describe some electronic effects that can play important roles in the energetics of tio@xmath0 .",
    "quadrupole polarisation of ions and dynamical charge transfer between ions are two effects that may have an important role to play . concerning the vibrational properties , the new potential can reproduce most features of _ ab initio _ and experimental results , and is a substantial improvement over the widely - used ma model for tio@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the potential provides an excellent description of the temperature dependence of the rutile lattice constants . the good description of vibrational properties from the proposed force field is further confirmed by thermodynamic quantities calculated from the phonon properties .",
    "the calculated free energy , entropy , specific heat under constant volume , and debye temperature via the new classical force field are in excellent agreement with those from _",
    "ab initio _ calculations .",
    "overall , our results indicate that the force field presented provides a very accurate description of atomic interactions in rutile tio@xmath0 .",
    "the force field can be applied with some confidence to studies of bulk properties of titania . while further testing is necessary",
    ", we can also hope that it provides an improved description of surface properties .",
    "if this is the case , it can be used to study , not only surfaces , but also nanocrystals and nanowires , all of which have huge technological importance for their catalytic and optical properties .",
    "we stress that no experimental data , other than the rutile crystal symmetry , has been used to parameterize this potential , therefore , we can be confident that its predictive capability is based on a robust description of the ions potential - energy surface .",
