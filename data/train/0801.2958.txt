    "the rohlin lemma is one of the fundamental results of ergodic theory . in @xcite alpern",
    "proved a generalization of the rohlin lemma ; he showed that given a free , measure preserving transformation @xmath1 of a lebesgue space @xmath2 , one can decompose @xmath2 into @xmath3 towers provided that @xmath4 and the heights of the towers do not have a non - trivial common divisor .",
    "he also showed that each tower can be made to take up any proportion of the space . a later , and shorter , proof was given in @xcite .",
    "alpern s multi - tower theorem has also played an important role in the proof of many recent important results in ergodic theory ( see @xcite for the original application ; see @xcite and @xcite for a survey of more recent applications ) and has been the subject of some recent research activity ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the rohlin lemma for @xmath0 actions for towers with rectangular shape was first shown by conze @xcite and katznelson and weiss @xcite .",
    "their results were subsumed by the later work of ornstein and weiss @xcite who have generalized the rohlin lemma to free actions of countable amenable groups .",
    "it follows from their work that for finite subsets @xmath5 of @xmath0 there is a rohlin lemma with towers of shape @xmath5 if and only if @xmath5 tiles @xmath0 .",
    "the alpern multi - tower theorem was generalized to @xmath0 for rectangular towers whose corresponding dimensions do not have a non - trivial common divisor by prikhodko @xcite in 1999 . in this paper",
    "we give a different proof of the same result obtained independently by the author in may , 2005 .",
    "the author gave multiple presentations of the argument in this paper before learning from v. s. prasad about prikhodko s article in october , 2005 .",
    "the approach given here can be viewed as playing the role of the simple \" proof of the higher dimensional result analogous to @xcite . in particular , establishing the desired distribution of the towers is an easy part of our argument , whereas it constitutes the bulk of the work in @xcite .",
    "the more significant difference in our approach lies in that we identify an intrinsic and dynamic property of a family of tilings which allows for a multi - tower decomposition with those tile shapes .",
    "this formulation provides a fruitful direction for investigating a more general multi - tower theorem .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath0 alpern multi - tower theorem for rectangles can be reformulated as a problem of tiling orbits of an action .",
    "it states that for a.e .",
    "@xmath6 , the orbit of @xmath7 under the action @xmath1 can be measurably tiled by @xmath4 rectangles whose corresponding dimensions have do not have a common divisor .",
    "further , these tilings can be constructed so that each rectangular tile has a previously prescribed probability distribution .",
    "tilings of @xmath0 by rectangles can be viewed as tilings of @xmath8 by dominos where each domino has integer dimensions , and whose vertices lie on the integer lattice . in the proof we present here we associate to each collection of required tower shapes a domino tiling of @xmath8 and we translate the problem of decomposing the space into multiple towers into the problem of finding a factor of the given system which is an invariant measure on the associated domino tiling system .",
    "this point of view allows us to identify a fairly innocuous mixing property of the tiling system ( having a _ uniform filling set _ ) as the key ingredient necessary to construct such a factor .",
    "there are many other well studied and interesting tilings which have this property including lozenge tilings and square ice , ( see @xcite ) and are a natural place to start investigating the possibility of a general multi tower theorem . namely , given a collection of shapes which tile @xmath0 can one establish necessary and sufficient conditions for there to be an alpern theorem with towers of these shapes ?",
    "we establish some notation to state the multi - tower theorem more formally .",
    "for @xmath9 we set @xmath10\\cap\\mathbb z$ ] .",
    "we call @xmath11 a rectangle in @xmath0 .",
    "given a @xmath0 action @xmath1 on a space @xmath2 , a subset @xmath12 of @xmath2 is called a _ rohlin tower of shape @xmath11 _ with @xmath13 if there exists a set @xmath14 with the property that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "we call the set @xmath17 the _ base of the tower_.    [ main]_(the @xmath0 alpern multi - tower theorem for rectangles ) _ let @xmath18 , and @xmath19 satisfy @xmath20 @xmath21    then given any free and measure preserving @xmath0 action @xmath1 of a lebesgue probability space @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , there are rohlin towers @xmath24 of shape @xmath25 with @xmath26    in the case where @xmath27 theorem [ main ] is alpern s original result .",
    "the numbers @xmath28 represent the heights of the towers and condition ( [ relpr ] ) states that their greatest common divisor is @xmath29 .",
    "this is clearly a necessary assumption since a non - trivial common divisor of the heights of the towers implies non - ergodicity of some power of the transformation @xmath1 .",
    "a similar argument can be made in the higher dimensional case , where a non - trivial common divisor of corresponding dimensions @xmath30 implies the non - ergodicity of the group element @xmath31 , where we let @xmath32 denote the standard basis of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that the higher dimensional result does not require additional constraints on the relationship between the dimensions of the towers in directions @xmath30 and @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "namely condition ( [ relpr ] ) is a sufficient condition for all dimensions @xmath35 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin by considering theorem  [ main ] in the case of finitely many rectangles .",
    "this case allows us to highlight the connection to symbolic tiling spaces , the mixing condition on these systems necessary to prove the result , and the ease with which we can guarantee the correct distribution of tiles .",
    "section  [ finite ] introduces the tiling spaces and contains the reduction of the proof of theorem  [ main ] to finding an invariant measure on the tiling system for the case of finitely many rectangles ( theorem  [ real ] ) .",
    "section  [ reduction ] contains necessary definitions and results related to mixing properties of shifts of finite type .",

    "on @xmath264 we proceed exactly as in the finite case , using @xmath265 to obtain the ambient word .",
    "for @xmath266 we fix @xmath267 and we set @xmath268\\ ] ] for @xmath269 .    to see all the necessary ingredients for the general induction step we also need to describe the construction of @xmath270 .",
    "fix @xmath271 and for @xmath272 we assign @xmath273\\ ] ] for @xmath274 .",
    "for @xmath275 we proceed as in the finite case using @xmath265 to provide an ambient word from @xmath246 , noting that any slices of previous stage towers that appear in @xmath276 come with sufficiently large filling collars that can be filled either by theorem  [ ufs ] or by corollary  [ genfil ] .",
    "we note that the resulting shapes can be interpolated into a word from @xmath246 using the modified version of lemma  [ extend ] .    to define @xmath245 we again begin by identifying points @xmath6 for which @xmath277 does not exist .",
    "in addition to points that lie in the error sets @xmath181 infinitely often or in the filling collars of infinitely many towers we must now also include points that land in @xmath278 for infinitely many @xmath174 . for each @xmath174",
    "this is a set of measure less than @xmath279 which by ( [ tailcontrol ] ) and ( [ cntcollar ] ) is less than @xmath280 .",
    "we can thus proceed to define the map @xmath171 exactly as in the finite case .    at the end of this construction",
    "we obtain a decomposition of @xmath2 into towers of shapes @xmath281 . as before , by ( [ cntmsr ] ) none of the first set of small towers take up more than their allotted part of space . in addition , we have by our choice of @xmath173 , ( [ tailcontrol ] ) , ( [ cntgetall ] ) , and ( [ tailmsr ] ) that @xmath282 .",
    "so if we supplement the measures of the towers @xmath283 , or create such towers in the case that @xmath284 , in increasing order of index we are guaranteed that we will decompose all of @xmath285 into required shape towers for all @xmath286 , ending with only towers of the desired shapes and measures .",
