    "quantum thermodynamics can address a single microscopic quantum device performing thermodynamical tasks such as heat transport , power generation and refrigeration .",
    "a dynamical perspective is incorporated in the field of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the established approach is based on the weak coupling system - bath approximation @xcite leading to markovian dynamics described by the l - gks master equation @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to dynamical evolution which is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we deviate from the established scenario and study a quantum device strongly coupled to the heat baths and undergoing non markovian dynamics .",
    "first we study the phenomena of heat transport .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics dictates that heat should always flow from the hot to the cold bath .",
    "we use this phenomenon to benchmark our model .",
    "once established we add to the model an external driving field .",
    "then the device can operate as a refrigerator pumping heat from the cold bath to the hot bath .",
    "the phenomenon of transport is associated with a gradient of a driving potential .",
    "even a single molecule subject to temperature gradient will experience a heat current flowing from the high potential to the lower one .",
    "modelling such a heat flow is the subject of this study .",
    "a novel idea is heat rectification , the possibility of asymmetric heat transfer when the baths are switched @xcite .",
    "employing such a concept one can imagine effectively isolating a subsystem in a far from equilibrium state",
    ". close to equilibrium the rectifying effect must vanish . in a series of papers segal and co workers studied the conditions for heat rectification tracing the effect to non linear phenomena either related to asymmetric baths ( case a ) or to asymmetric system bath coupling ( case b ) @xcite . in the present paper heat transport of case b",
    "is analysed based on the non markovian stochastic surrogate hamiltonian approach @xcite .    the popular theoretical approach to describe heat transport in a network is to compose the transport equations from local equations .",
    "this local approach is correct when only populations are involved .",
    "however , when quantum systems are involved the local approach leads to the violation of the second law of thermodynamis @xcite .",
    "a thermodynamically consistent treatment within the weak coupling system - bath approximation requires first to diagonalize the total subsystem network obtaining the global transition frequencies of the total system @xcite .",
    "an alternative is a careful perturbation analysis @xcite .",
    "only then the weak coupling procedure can be applied to obtain the consistent transport equations .",
    "a major assumption in the derivation is a tensor product form of the system and baths at all times .",
    "the weak coupling procedure employed in ref .",
    "@xcite is global and consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "the standard treatment of transport is based on the landauer - buttiker scattering theory @xcite .",
    "each scattering event which transports energy from one bath to the other is assumed to be independent resulting in a poissonian process .",
    "this ballistic description ignores intricate dynamics between the molecular device and its leads .",
    "can one derive a consistent transport theory beyond the weak system bath coupling limit ?",
    "an attempt in this direction has been described by segal @xcite who studied a two - level - system coupled to a spin bath in the intermediate coupling limit .",
    "the derivation is based on the niba approach which allows to evaluate the memory kernel explicitly .",
    "the study finds that the rectifying effect exists in the intermediate coupling range and vanishes in the weak coupling limit of the two - level - system to the spin baths .",
    "the niba method can only be employed for very simple system hamiltonians such as a two - level - system or harmonic oscillators .",
    "this approach using the polaron transformation was employed to constuct a model of solar energy harvesting @xcite .",
    "therefore a more general approach appropriate for an arbitrary system is required .",
    "recently the nonequilibrium green s function approach ( ngfa ) has been suggested as a framework of quantum thermodynamics @xcite . in this approach the energy of the system and its coupling to the reservoirs",
    "are controlled by a slow external time - dependent force treated to first order beyond the quasistatic limit .    in the present study of heat transport a correlated system - bath scenario",
    "is employed .",
    "we defy the assumption used in all previous studies of an uncorrelated system and baths represented as a tensor product @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in addition the system hamiltonian is represented on a grid , practically achieving a hilbert space of the size of @xmath1 .",
    "the transport dynamics is simulated based on the stochastic surrogate hamiltonian approach @xcite .",
    "the method represents the state by a global system - bath wave function .",
    "this leads to a strongly entangled state at all times . as a result",
    "the dynamics is non markovian .",
    "a stochastic layer is employed to trim the calculation and define the bath temperature .",
    "we check the validity of the approach by evaluating that the total entropy generation is positive . once the method is established the asymmetric rectifying effect with identical spin baths is studied .    by adding an external driving field the device",
    "is transformed to a refrigerator , driving heat from the cold to the hot bath .",
    "this device falls in the category of continuous quantum engines @xcite .",
    "optimal performance will be achieved when the driving frequency is in resonance with the frequency difference of the left and right bath .",
    "the refrigeration is studied in the strong coupling regime .",
    "it is expected that the cooling current deviates from a linear relation with the coupling .",
    "such an effect has been observed using the niba approach @xcite .",

    "the fast convergences can be related to quantum typicality meaning that the vast majority of all pure states featuring a common expectation value of some generic observable at a given time will yield very similar expectation values of the same observable at any later time @xcite .",

    "these features have been observed in properly constructed markovian models based on the l - gks equations .",
    "a proper construction of l - gks equations which is conistant with the second law of thermodynamics requires a floquet analysis and therefore is limited to periodic driving @xcite .",

    "an increase in @xmath68 generates a non - local density supporting flux from the cold to hot bath .",
    "further increase in @xmath68 localizes the system on the hot side dissipating power to the hot bath .",
    "the ssh method lends itself to the study of the role of fluctuations in the device currents .",
    "we can compare the current in a single realization to the average over many realizations . due to the size of the hilbert space in present study @xmath76 very few realizations are sufficient to converge the relevant observables .",
