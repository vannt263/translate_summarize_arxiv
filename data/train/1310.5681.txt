    "the novel topological magnetic structure called skyrmion crystal ( skx ) , observed recently in solids , attracts great interest due to various promising physical properties , both from a academical and technological point of view @xcite .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the interaction of skyrmions ( sk ) with an electric current leading to the topological and anomalous hall effect @xcite as well as giving potential access to a new generation of spintronic devices based on current - driven sk manipulations @xcite . predicted and investigated theoretically by bogdanov _",
    "@xcite , the skx requires the presence of chiral interactions in the system , e.g. , the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) induced so - called dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction intrinsic for systems with lack of inversion symmetry @xcite . this interaction can be responsible for a helimagnetic ( hm ) structure in the absence of an external magnetic field @xmath1 , while the vortex - like sk magnetic structure can be stabilized by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the presence of chiral interactions discerns skyrmions from so - called magnetic bubbles discussed in the literature and appearing due to dipole - dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "the skx state was observed experimentally for the first time in the mnsi compound with b20 crystal structure @xcite . since then , the skx observation in bulk materials was reported also for others systems , e.g. , fege , fe@xmath2co@xmath3si , mn@xmath2fe@xmath3si and mn@xmath2co@xmath3si @xcite .",
    "the conditions for skyrmion stability in these systems were investigated theoretically by phenomenological considerations based on the landau - ginzburg energy functional @xcite . to describe properly the itinerant - electron properties of magnetism in these systems in the vicinity of the transition to the paramagnetic ( pm ) state , bogdanov and rler account also for the energy related to longitudinal spin fluctuations .",
    "interesting is that in 3d materials the temperature window of skx stability in the phase diagram is rather narrow and located just below the transition temperature to the pm state . in the case of 2d systems ,",
    "the skx phase can exist in a larger temperature range approaching the temperature @xmath4  k @xcite .",
    "note that skx observation in 3d systems is rather difficult because of the relatively weak dm interaction , while the formation of a non - collinear magnetic state requires the dm value strong enough to compete with the isotropic exchange interactions .",
    "this requirement can be met in deposited monolayers as observed experimentally in particular for fe / ir(111 ) overlayers @xcite , mn / w(110 ) overlayers @xcite having soc - induced hm structure as well as sk magnetic structure recently observed in fe(1ml)/ir(111 ) @xcite and pd / fe(1ml)/ir(111 ) @xcite .    despite the detailed theoretical investigations based on a phenomenological approach , a complete understanding of the conditions for the skx appearance can not be obtained without a detailed analysis of the microscopic origin of the exchange interactions ( both , isotropic and anisotropic ) and magneto - crystalline anisotropy ( mca ) , that needs a fully relativistic _",
