    "a basic tension remains between disappearance and appearance experiments . in one fit@xcite",
    "these are compatible only at the level of 0.008% , mainly owing to a poor fit to the low - energy miniboone `` @xmath1 '' signal . for another fit ,",
    "see ref.@xcite an initial incompatibility between neutrino and antineutrino fits , favoring @xmath22 , has been resolved with subsequent data , so there is no longer preference for more than one flavor of sterile neutrino.@xcite nevertheless , should such a need arise in the future , the  scheme provides a natural home for three sterile flavors ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "if this state is given a large majorana mass , the corresponding left - handed neutrino majorana mass can be made very small ( the _ seesaw _",

    "the singlet of so(10 ) ( `` @xmath31 '' ) is a sterile neutrino candidate . since one needs three 27 s to account for three families of ordinary quarks and leptons , there are three sterile neutrinos in .",

    ". a large majorana @xmath28 mass is then permitted by @xmath39 conservation , enabling a seesaw mechanism with fermion masses generated by a 27-plet higgs representation.@xcite the u(1 ) charges for various members of a 27-plet are shown in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath40 , coupling to @xmath39 , has characteristic branching fractions . within a single family ,",
    "25% of its decays are to ordinary fermions ( above the middle line in table 2 ) while 75% are to exotic fermions ( below the middle line ) .",
    "these consist of a vector - like charged lepton @xmath41 , its neutrino @xmath42 , an isosinglet quark @xmath43 , and the sterile neutrino @xmath31 .",
    "if the @xmath40 is found at the lhc , it is a potential source of exotic quarks and leptons .",
    "the differences between left - handed ( l ) and right - handed ( r ) couplings give rise to characteristic production and decay asymmetries.@xcite    while @xmath44 , we wish to see what follows from assuming @xmath45 dominates , which was a popular assumption in the early days of string theory .",
    "some mass matrix elements will be absent as their @xmath46 values are nt in @xmath45 .",
    "the u(1 ) charges for the product 27 @xmath33 27 are shown in table 3 , where we have listed values of @xmath47 .",
    "blank entries denote charges not found in a @xmath45-plet , implying a zero entry in the mass matrix .",
    "the exception ( in the box ) is a majorana mass for the right - handed neutrino @xmath48 , which must be generated by a higher - dimension operator conserving @xmath39 .    for simplicity",
    "we make two further assumptions .",
    "first , we let @xmath42 pair up with @xmath49 to obtain a large dirac mass @xmath50 .",
    "second , we assume an approximate @xmath51 symmetry to suppress vacuum expectation values stemming from so(10 ) 16-plets in comparison with those from so(10 ) 10 s or singlets . the mass matrix in the basis @xmath52 , where we have used small letters to denote entries with weak isospin @xmath53 and large letters to denote entries with @xmath54 , is @xmath55~.\\ ] ]",

    "for the small masses , the resulting @xmath61 mass matrix in the @xmath62 basis is @xmath63~.\\ ] ] we look for solutions with small mixing and @xmath64 : @xmath65~,~~   n= \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } -\\sin\\theta \\cr \\cos\\theta \\end{array } \\right]~,~~ t \\equiv \\tan \\theta~,\\ ] ] so we seek a small-@xmath66 solution of a quadratic equation in @xmath66 , which in its linearized form is @xmath67 barring accidental cancellations , after several steps we get @xmath68 with small mixing if @xmath69 and @xmath70 the smallness of @xmath71 is curious but achievable via the approximate @xmath51 symmetry mentioned earlier .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix can be related to those for charged fermions at a unification scale .",
    "thus , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are related to masses of quarks of charge 2/3 , while @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath71 , and @xmath50 are related to charge 1/3 quark and charged lepton masses .",
    "specifically , for up - type quarks , the u(1 ) charges of masses are ( 2,2,2 ) , corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath73 .",
    "the relation of @xmath72 to @xmath77 is familiar from so(10 ) unification . for down - type quarks and charged leptons ,",
    "the correspondences are ( 2,2,3)@xmath78 ,  ( 1,5,0)@xmath79 ,  ( 1,3,2)@xmath80 , and ( 4,0,5)@xmath81 . in the absence of mixing , @xmath75 is related to dirac masses of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while @xmath50 is related to dirac masses of quarks and charged leptons in the 10 of so(10 ) .",
    "weak universality suggests @xmath84 ( because isosinglet impurities in left - handed charged leptons and down - type quarks should be small ) , while there is less of a constraint on @xmath71 as it has @xmath85 .",
    "the present model has mixing only within single families . in order to explain the lsnd and miniboone electron appearance signals one needs both muon and electron neutrinos to mix with the same sterile neutrino .",
    "the freedom of setting a sterile neutrino mass and mixing for one family ( the matrix @xmath86 in the previous section ) is encouraging for the case of three families ( which must be represented by a @xmath87 matrix ) .",
    "furthermore , if data improve to the extent that three sterile neutrinos are needed to explain oscillations ,  is available .",
    "another possible use of a third sterile @xmath88 is as a warm dark matter candidate at the kev scale , as suggested some time ago . for more recent reviews",
    "in contrast to many schemes , the present one distinguishes between right - hand neutrinos ( usually taken very heavy , at the seesaw scale ) and the @xmath31 s ( one of which can easily have kev - scale mass ) .",
    "there have been two claims for observation of an x - ray line near 3.5 kev.@xcite these signals could arise from a 7 kev `` neutrino '' decaying to a photon and a much lighter `` neutrino . ''",
    "a corresponding signal is _ not _ seen , however , in the milky way.@xcite    there are some special features of  concerning a 7 kev dark matter candidate .",
    "the higgs vacuum expectation values considered here correspond to the five neutral complex scalar bosons in the @xmath45 representation of .",
    "the masses of these bosons are free parameters ; two of the five are those of the minimal supersymmetric standard model or so(10 ) .",
    "exchanges of these bosons can produce the states @xmath31 ; for example , in the processes @xmath89 a tev - scale @xmath40 produced in the early universe would have appreciable branching ratio into @xmath90 pairs , so @xmath31 are candidates for early overproduction unless their abundance is diluted by subsequent entropy production.@xcite",
    "none of the various hints of sterile neutrinos rises to the level of a conclusive observation so it is crucial to strengthen or refute them .",
    "some effects may be due to interesting non-@xmath88 physics : for example , if the miniboone low - energy signal is photons and not electrons .",
    "the grand unified group  [ the next step up from so(10 ) ] naturally incorporates three candidates for neutrinos with neither left - handed nor right - handed weak isospin .  breaking to the standard model times a particular u(1)@xmath91 allows a large majorana mass for the right - handed neutrino @xmath28 and hence the standard seesaw mechanism can proceed without constraints.@xcite masses and mixings of three sterile neutrinos are at one s disposal to fit oscillation data , assuming present anomalies are really due to sterile @xmath88 and not something else .",
    "if at most two sterile neutrinos are needed to fit anomalies successfully , a third is left over as a dark matter candidate .",
    "the  scheme appears to have enough free parameters to allow such a scenario to successfully navigate a number of constraints .",
