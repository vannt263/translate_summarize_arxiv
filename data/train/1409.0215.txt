    "this explains why the tilings of the plane have retained no less attention than the tilings of the space  and we do focus here on the former .",

    "+ as for any material , understanding a quasicrystal means not only understanding its structure but also its stability , that is , how finite - range energetic interactions make the atoms achieving such a structure . in terms of tilings , this means understanding how constraints on the way neighbor tiles can fit together ",
    "one speaks about _ local rules _  enforce the planarity of a tiling .",

    "let us however mention that such a characterization has been recently obtained when _ decorated _ local rules are allowed ( see @xcite ) . in terms of symbolic dynamics , the tiling sets defined by undecorated or decorated local rules are respectively called _ tiling spaces of finite type _ or _ sofic tiling spaces _",

    "+ among the several conditions on the planar rhombus tilings with ( undecorated ) weak or strong local rules that have been found ( @xcite ) , we are interested in thoses which deal with @xmath0-fold tilings . in @xcite , socolar proved that the @xmath0-fold tilings admit weak local rules as soon as @xmath0 is not a multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "this disproved the common belief that whenever a planar rhombus tiling admits weak local rules , then the plane its lift stays at bounded distance of can always be defined by _",
    "quadratic _ irrationalities ( irrationalities are cubic already for @xmath6 ) .",
    "socolar moreover explicitly derived simple local rules from what he called the _",
    "alternation condition_. without going into details , this condition states that each rhombus tile must `` alternate '' in a specific way with its mirror image with respect to one of its edges .",
    "the problem with the @xmath5-fold tilings is that they have square tiles which are equal to their own mirror image ! actually , burkov proved in @xcite that the @xmath3-fold tilings , also known as the ammann - beenker tilings , do not admit weak local rules . to prove this",
    ", he provided a one - parameter family of planar rhombus tilings which contains the @xmath3-fold tilings , and such that the closer the parameter is to the one of the @xmath3-fold tilings , the larger is the smallest pattern which allows to distinguish the tilings corresponding to each parameter .",
    "we here extend this by providing , for each @xmath7 , such a one - parameter family for the @xmath5-fold tiling .",
    "this yields our main result :    [ th : main ] the @xmath5-fold tilings do not admit weak local rules .",
    "let us briefly describe the two main tools that shall be used to prove this .",
    "the first one is the notion of _ window _ , which is classic in the context of so - called _ cut and project tilings_. it is a convenient tool to study the patterns that appear in a planar rhombus tilings , and we shall especially rely on results obtained by julien in @xcite .",
    "the second tool is the notion of _ subperiod _ , introduced by the authors in @xcite and which corresponds to the _ second - intersection condition _ earlier introduced by levitov in @xcite and used , _",
    "e.g. _ , by le in @xcite . roughly speaking , a subperiod is a rational dependency between _ some _ of the entries of vectors which generate a ( possibly irrational ) plane .",
    "this is the notion that led us to the one - paramater families of planar rhombus tilings that is used to show theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : settings ] , we formally define the above mentioned notions : rhombus tilings and their lift in a higher dimensional space , planar tilings , @xmath0-fold tilings , weak local rules and subperiods .",
    "we also review some basic properties of grassmann coordinates . in section  [ sec : subperiods ] , we define the one - parameter families of planar rhombus tilings that is used to show theorem  [ th : main ] . in section  [ sec : window ] , we briefly recall known results on the window of a planar tiling and introduce the notion of _ coincidence_. we finally prove theorem  [ th : main ] in section  [ sec : coincidences ] .",
