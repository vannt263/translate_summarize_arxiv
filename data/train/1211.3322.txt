    "while the capacity region of the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcast channel ( bc ) was established in  @xcite , the characterization of the capacity of gaussian interference channel ( ic ) has been a long - standing open problem , even for the two - user single - antenna case .",
    "recent progress sheds light on this problem from various perspectives , among which the authors in @xcite characterized the degrees of freedom ( dof ) region , specializing to the large snr regime , for the two - user mimo ic .",
    "such advance nevertheless suggests achievable schemes which require the full knowledge of channel state information ( csi ) at both the transmitter and receiver sides . in practice , however , the acquisition of perfect csi at the transmitters is difficult , if not impossible , especially for fast fading channels .",
    "the csit obtained via feedback suffers from delays , which renders the available csit feedback possibly fully obsolete ( i.e. , uncorrelated with the current true channel ) under the fast fading channel and , seemingly non - exploitable in view of designing the spatial precoding .",
    "recently , this common accepted viewpoint in such scenario ( referred to as `` delayed csit '' ) was challenged by an interesting information theoretic work @xcite , in which a novel scheme ( termed here as `` mat alignment '' ) was proposed for the miso bc to demonstrate that even the completely outdated channel feedback is still useful .",
    "the precoders are designed achieving strictly better dof than what is obtained without any csit .",
    "the essential ingredient for the proposed scheme in @xcite lies in the use of a multi - slot protocol initiating with the transmission of unprecoded information symbols to the user terminals , followed by the _ analog _ forwarding of the interference created in the previous time slots .",
    "most recently , generalizations under the similar principle to the mimo bc  @xcite , mimo ic @xcite settings , among others , were also addressed , where the dof regions are fully characterized with arbitrary antenna configurations , again establishing dof strictly beyond the ones obtained without csit  @xcite but below the ones with perfect csit @xcite .",
    "note that other recent interesting lines of work combining instantaneous and delayed forms of feedback were reported in @xcite .",
    "albeit inspiring and fascinating from a conceptual point of view , these works made an assumption that the channel is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) across time , where the delayed csit bears no correlation with the current channel realization .",
    "hence , these results pessimistically consider that no estimate for the _ current _ channel realization is producible to the transmitter . owing to the finite doppler spread behavior of fading channels",
    ", it is however the case in many real life situations that the past channel realizations can provide _ some _ information about the current one .",
    "therefore a scenario where the transmitter is endowed with delayed csi in addition to some ( albeit imperfect ) estimate of the current channel is of practical relevance .",
    "together with the delayed csit , the benefit of such imperfect current csit was first exploited in @xcite for the miso bc whereby a novel transmission scheme was proposed which improves over pure mat alignment in constructing precoders based on delayed _ and _ current csit estimate .",
    "the full characterization of the optimal dof for this hybrid csit was later reported in @xcite for the miso bc under this setting .",
    "the key idea behind the schemes ( termed hereafter as `` @xmath0-mat alignment '' ) in @xcite lies in the modification of the mat alignment such that i ) the initial time slot involves transmission of _ precoded _ symbols , which enables to reduce the power of mutual interferences and efficiently compress them ; ii ) the subsequent slots perform a digital transmission of quantized residual interferences together with new private symbols .",
    "most recently , this philosophy was extended to the mimo networks ( bc / ic ) but only with symmetric antenna configuration  @xcite , as well as the @xmath1-user miso case @xcite .",
    "the generalization to the miso bc with different qualities of imperfect current csit was also studied in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the authors of @xcite showed that , in order to balance the asymmetry of the csit quality , an infinite number of time slots are required .",
    "as such , they extended the number of phases of the @xmath0-mat alignment  @xcite to infinity and varied the length of each phase , such that the optimal dof can be achieved .",
    "unfortunately , extending the previous results to the mimo case with arbitrary antenna configurations is not a trivial step , even with the symmetric current csit quality assumption .",
    "the main challenges are two - fold : ( a ) the extra spatial dimension at the receiver side introduces a non - trivial tradeoff between useful signal and mutual interference , and ( b ) the asymmetry of receive antenna configurations results in the discrepancy of common - message - decoding capability at different receivers .",
    "in particular , the total number of streams that can be delivered as common messages to both receivers is inevitably limited by the weaker one  ( i.e. , with fewer antennas ) . such a constraint prevents the system from achieving the optimal dof of the symmetric case by simply extending the previous schemes developed in  @xcite .    to counter these new challenges posed by the asymmetry of antenna configurations ,",
    "we develop a new strategy that balances the discrepancy of common - message - decoding capability at two receivers .",
    "this allows us to fully characterize the dof region of both mimo bc and mimo ic , achieved by a unified and simple scheme built upon _ block - markov encoding_. this encoding concept was first introduced in @xcite for relay channels and then became a standard tool for communication problems involving interaction between nodes , such as feedback  ( e.g. , @xcite ) or user cooperation  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that our problem with both delayed and instantaneous csit , closely related to @xcite , can also be solved with this scheme . as it will become clear later , in each block",
    ", the transmitter superimposes the common information about the interference created in the past block  ( due to the imperfect instantaneous csit ) on the new private information  ( thus creating new interference ) . at the receiver side ,",
    "backward decoding is employed , i.e. , the decoding of each block relies on the common side information from decoding of the future block . due to the repetitive nature in each block",
    ", the proposed scheme can be uniquely characterized with the parameters such as the power allocation and rate splitting of the superposition .",
    "surprisingly enough , our block - markov scheme can also include the asymmetry of current csit with a simple parameter change , and thus somehow balance the global asymmetry , i.e. , antenna asymmetry and csit asymmetry , in the system .",
    "overall , our results allow to bridge between previously reported csit scenarios such as the pure delayed csit of @xcite and the pure instantaneous csit scenarios @xcite for the mimo setting .",
    "we tackle both the bc and ic configurations as we point out the tight connection between the dof achieving transmission strategies in both settings .",
    "more specifically , we obtain the following key results :    * we establish outer bounds on the dof region for the two - user temporally - correlated mimo bc and ic with perfect delayed and imperfect current csit , as a function of the current csit quality _ exponent_. by introducing a virtual received signal for the ic , we nicely link the outer bound to that of the bc , arriving at a similar outer bound result for both cases .",
    "in addition to the genie - aided bounding techniques and the application of the extremal inequality in @xcite , we develop a set of upper and lower bounds of ergodic capacity for mimo channels , which is essential for the mimo case but not extendible from miso .",
    "* we propose a unified framework relying on block - markov encoding uniquely parameterized by the rate splitting and power allocation , by which the optimal dof region confined by the outer bound are achievable with perfect delayed plus imperfect current csit . for any antenna and current csit settings ,",
    "every point in the outer bound region can be achieved with one single scheme .",
    "for instance , the mimo bc with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 achieves optimal sum dof @xmath5 when @xmath6 and @xmath7 otherwise , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are imperfect current csit qualities for both users channels .",
    "this smoothly connects three special cases : the case with pure delayed csit @xcite ( @xmath10 ) , that with perfect current csit @xcite ( @xmath11 ) , and that with perfect csit at receiver  1 and delayed csit at receiver  2 @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "* we propose a new systematic way to prove the achievability . in the proposed framework ,",
    "the achievability region is defined by the decodability conditions in terms of the rate splitting and power allocation .",
    "the achievability is proved by mapping the outer bound region into a set of proper rate and power allocation and showing that this set lies within the decodability region .",
    "this contrasts with most existing proofs in the literature where the achievability of each corner point is checked .",
    "it is worth noting that our results embrace the previously reported particular cases : the perfect csit setting @xcite ( i.e. , current csit of perfect quality ) , the pure delayed csit setting @xcite  ( i.e. , current csit of zero quality ) , the partial / hybrid csit mimo bc / ic case @xcite  ( with perfect csit at one receiver and delayed csit at the other one ) , and the special miso case @xcite with @xmath13 , symmetric mimo case @xcite , as well as the miso case with asymmetric current csit qualities  @xcite .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the system model and assumptions in the coming section , followed by the main results on dof region characterization for both mimo bc and mimo ic cases in section iii .",
    "some illustrative examples of the achievability schemes are provided in section iv , followed by the general formulation in section v. in section vi , we present the proofs of outer bounds .",

    "we are interested in characterizing the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the above system as functions of the quality of current csit , thus bridging between the two previously investigated extremes which are the perfect instantaneous csit and the fully outdated ( no instantaneous ) csit cases .",
    "as it was established in previous works  @xcite , the imperfect current csit has beneficial value ( in terms of improving the dof ) only if the csit estimation error decays at least exponentially with the snr or faster .",

    "in fact , after some basic computations , it turns out that there are @xmath623 dots .          according to ( * ? ? ? * lemma  1 ) , for any @xmath628 with the entries in @xmath629 i.i.d .",

    "therefore , we have @xmath651where the first inequality is from on which we apply jensen s inequality ; @xmath652 is a diagonal matrix composed of the @xmath646 largest eigenvalues of @xmath647 .",
    "next , let @xmath653 , @xmath654 . without loss of generality , we assume that the columns of @xmath655 and @xmath656 are arranged such that the conditions in lemma  [ lemma : ess_lb ] and lemma  [ lemma : ess_lb2 ] are satisfied ( i.e. , @xmath657 , where @xmath658 is the cyclic window with size @xmath589 , and @xmath659 is defined as in lemma  [ lemma : ess_lb ] ) , respectively .",
    "this also implies that the eigenvalues in @xmath660 and @xmath652 are arranged accordingly . in the following ,",

    "this completes the proof of for the case @xmath645 .      for the first term in ,",
    "we bound it as follows @xmath682 where in ( [ eq : theorem-2 - 1 ] ) , @xmath683 with @xmath684 and @xmath685 ; ( [ eq : theorem-2 - 2 ] ) comes from the equality @xmath686 ; ( [ eq : theorem-2 - 3 ] ) is due to poincare separation theorem  @xcite that @xmath687 for @xmath688 ; ( [ eq : theorem-2 - 4 ] ) is from the fact that @xmath689 ; ( [ eq : theorem-2 - 5 ] ) is obtained by applying jensen s inequality ; @xmath690 and @xmath691 with @xmath646 being the number of eigenvalues that are not smaller than @xmath635 , i.e. , @xmath692 .",

    "<S> specifically , a simple unified framework is proposed , allowing to attain optimal dof region for the general antenna configurations and current csit qualities . </S>",
    "<S> such a framework builds upon _ block - markov encoding _ with _ interference quantization _ , optimally combining the use of both outdated and instantaneous csit . </S>",
    "<S> a striking feature of our work is that , by varying the power allocation , _ every _ point in the dof region can be achieved with one single scheme . as a result , instead of checking the achievability of every corner point of the outer bound region , as typically done in the literature </S>",
