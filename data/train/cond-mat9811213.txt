    "in the present paper we consider a generalized hubbard model including correlated hopping  @xcite .",
    "in such a model the hopping integrals , which describe hoppings of holes and doublons are different .",
    "these hopping integrals also are distinguished from the hopping integral which is connected with the processes of paired creation and destruction of holes and doublons . in recent years",
    "the similar models have been studied intensively  @xcite - @xcite . in particular ,",
    "some of these models  @xcite have been solved exactly under the condition that the number of doubly occupied sites is conserved .",
    "the important puzzle arising in an investigation of the generalized models is metal - insulator transition problem . in papers",
    "@xcite a new mean - field approximation ( mfa ) which leads to the correct description of metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has been proposed . in the present paper",
    "we use this mfa to study mit in a generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping at half - filling and zero temperature . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the hamiltonian of narrow - band model .",
    "the decoupling scheme of green functions is described in sec .",
    "3 . also single - particle green function and energy spectrum of electon system are calculated . in sec .  4 the expression for energy gap width is found . with the help of this formula and",
    "the obtained expression for the concentration of polar states mit is studied .",
    "finally , sec .  5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "theoretical analysis , on the one hand , and available experimental data , on the other hand , point out the necessity of the hubbard model  @xcite generalization by taking into account interelectron interactions describing intersite hoppings of electrons ( correlated hopping )  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic property of these correlated hopping integrals is the dependence on the occupation of sites by electrons .",
    "so , we start from the following generalization of the hubbard model including correlated hopping  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the operators of creation and destruction for the electrons with spin @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) on @xmath4-site , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the chemical potential ; @xmath8 is the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion ; @xmath9 is the matrix element which describe the hoppings of electrons between nearest - neighbor sites of lattice in consequence of electron - ion interaction , @xmath10 ( @xmath11-function is the wannier function ) .",
    "the prime at second sum in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) signifies that @xmath12 .",
    "in hamiltonian  ( 2.1 ) we rewrite the sum @xmath13 in the form @xmath14 ( @xmath15 denotes the spin projection which is opposite to @xmath2 ) , here we have used that @xmath16 in consequence of the matrix elements symmetry . let us suppose ( as in the papers  @xcite ) that @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( sites @xmath4 and @xmath20 are nearest neighbors ) ; it should be noted that this supposition is exact in the homeopolar limit ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus at half - filling ( @xmath22 ) we can write hamiltonian  ( 2.1 ) in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ".    note that at @xmath26 the model will be described also by hamiltonian  ( 2.5 ) with @xmath27 i.e. taking into account the correlated hopping @xmath28 leads to the concentration dependence of the hopping integral @xmath29 .",
    "it is the distinction of the present model from similar models  @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath22 taking into account the correlated hopping @xmath28 leads to the renormalization of the hopping integral @xmath9 only .",
    "rewrite hamiltonian  ( 2.5 ) in terms of @xmath30-hubbard operators  @xcite using the formulae  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath30 is the transition - operator of @xmath4-site from state @xmath32 to state @xmath33 ; @xmath34 denotes the site , which is not occupied by an electron ( hole ) , @xmath35 denotes the singly occupied ( by an electron with spin @xmath2 ) @xmath4-site , @xmath36 denotes the doubly occupied ( by two electrons with the opposite spins ) @xmath4-site ( doublon ) .    in terms of @xmath30-operators",
    "hamiltonian  ( 2.5 ) takes the following form : @xmath37 with @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the operator of the number of @xmath33-states on @xmath4-site , @xmath40 ; @xmath41    the single - particle green function @xmath42 in terms of hubbard operators is written @xmath43    @xmath44 describes the atomic limit of narrow - band models .",
    "@xmath45 describes the translational hopping of holes and doublons . in the present model ( in contrast to the narrow - band models of the hubbard type ) the hopping integrals of holes @xmath29 and doublons @xmath46 are different .",
    "it should be noted that in consequence of the difference of the hopping integrals , which describe translational hopping of current carriers within the lower ( hole ) band and upper ( doublon ) band , the energy width of the upper band can be much smaller and the effective mass of current carriers within this band can be much larger than in the lower band .",
    "thus , within the proposed model the ideas of the `` wide '' and `` narrow '' subbands and the `` light '' and `` heavy '' current carriers are introduced ( as the result of electron - electron interactions ) .",
    "@xmath47 describes the processes of paired creation and destruction of holes and doublons .",
    "here we use mfa proposed in papers  @xcite to calculate the energy spectrum of electron system described by hamiltonian  ( 2.7 ) .",
    "the green function @xmath48 is given by the equation @xmath49|x_{p'}^{\\sigma",
    "0}\\rangle\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\langle\\langle\\left[x_p^{0\\sigma } , h'_1\\right]|x_{p'}^{\\sigma 0}\\rangle \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50=ab - ba$ ] , @xmath51=t\\sum_j\\left((x_p^{\\sigma}+x_p^{0 } ) x_j^{0\\sigma}+x_p^{\\bar{\\sigma } \\sigma}x_j^{0\\bar{\\sigma}}\\right)-\\tilde{t } \\sum_jx_p^{02}x_j^{2\\sigma},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52=&&-t'\\sum_jx_p^{02}x_j^{\\bar{\\sigma}0}+ t'\\sum_jx_p^{\\bar{\\sigma } \\sigma}x_j^{\\sigma2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -t'\\sum_j(x_p^{\\sigma}+x_p^{0})x_j^{\\bar{\\sigma}2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to break off the sequence of green function equations according to generalized hartree - fock approximation  @xcite we suppose that @xmath51=\\sum_{j}\\epsilon(pj)x_j^{0\\sigma},\\ \\left[x_p^{0\\sigma } , h'_1\\right]=\\sum_{j}\\epsilon_1(pj)x_j^{\\bar{\\sigma}2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the non - operator expressions .",
    "the representation choice of the commutators in form  ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) is prompted by the operator structure of these commutators which maps the energy non - equivalence of the hopping processes prescribed by @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "taking into account  ( 3.4 ) we rewrite eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) in the form @xmath55 after anticommutation of both sides of the first of formulae  ( 3.4 ) with @xmath56 and the second formula with @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 @xmath59    similarly , for the green function @xmath60 we can write the equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are determined through the expressions which are analogous to ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ) .",
    "thus we obtain the closed system of equations for the green functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    by neglecting correlated hopping and by averaging expressions  ( 3.6 ) and  ( 3.7 )",
    "we obtain the approximations  @xcite ; the defects of these approximations are well - known ( see , for example ref .  @xcite ) . here",
    "we use the approach which has been proposed in the papers  @xcite .    to determine @xmath66 we rewrite @xmath30-operator in eqs .",
    "( 3.6 ) and  ( 3.7 ) in the form  @xcite @xmath67 , where @xmath68 are the operators of creation and destruction for @xmath33- and @xmath32-states on @xmath4-site respectively ( the schubin - wonsowsky operators  @xcite ) ; thus @xmath69 .",
    "let us substitute @xmath70-operators by @xmath71-numbers in eqs .",
    "( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ) ( here there is a partial equivalence with slave boson method  @xcite ) @xmath72 ( we consider a paramagnetic case , electron concentration on site @xmath22 ) ; @xmath73 is the concentration of polar states ( holes or doublons ) .",
    "the proposed approximation is based on the following physical idea .",
    "let us consider a paramagnetic mott - hubbard insulator at @xmath74 . within the wide temperature interval ( @xmath75 ) the concentration of polar states is small ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "an analogous consideration is valid for a paramagnetic mott - hubbard semimetal ( hole and doublon subbands overlap weakly , @xmath76 ) .",
    "so , the change of states and polar excitations influences on @xmath77-states weakly .",
    "thus we may consider @xmath77-states as the quasiclassical system and substitute the operators @xmath78 by @xmath71-numbers .",
    "in addition , when we find @xmath66 we substitute the creation and destruction operators of @xmath34- and @xmath79-states through the respective quasiclassical expressions .",
    "actually the proposed approximation is equivalent to a separation of the charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "note that the present approach is the most justifiable when @xmath80 .",
    "thus in @xmath81-representation we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the fourier transforms of the hopping integral @xmath84 respectively .",
    "similarly , we find that @xmath85    the fourier transform of the green function @xmath64 is found from the system of equations  ( 3.5 ) and  ( 3.8 ) @xmath86 with @xmath87 ^ 2 + ( 4dt'_{\\bf k})^2},\\ b=1 - 2d+4d^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an analogous procedure is realized also in the equations for the other green functions in eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) .",
    "finally , in * k*-representation the single - particle green function is @xmath88    single - particle green function  ( 3.15 ) gives the exact atomic and band limits : if @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( it means neglecting correlated hopping ) then @xmath91 takes the band form ( @xmath92 when @xmath89 ) , if @xmath93 then we obtain the exact atomic limit .",
    "the peculiarities of obtained quasiparticle energy spectrum  ( 3.13 ) of narrow - band system which is described by hamiltonian  ( 2.5 ) are the dependence on the concetration of polar states and the non - equivalence of the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "this non - equivalence is caused by the difference of the hopping integrals @xmath29 , @xmath46 , @xmath94 .",
    "quasiparticle energy spectrum  ( 3.13 ) allows to study mit in the proposed model .",
    "with the help of energy spectrum of electrons  ( 3.13 ) we find the expression for the energy gap width ( difference of energies between bottom of the upper and top of the lower hubbard bands ) : @xmath95 ^ 2+(4dzt')^2},\\nonumber\\\\   & & q_2=\\sqrt{\\left [ b(w-\\tilde{w})+u\\right]^2+(4dzt')^2},\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the half - widths of the lower ( hole ) and upper ( doublon ) hubbard bands respictevely : @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is the number of nearest neighbors to a site ) .    the peculiarities of the expression for energy gap  ( 4.1 ) are dependences on the concentration of polar states , on the widths of hole and doublon bands , on the hopping integral @xmath94 ( thus on external pressure ) . at given @xmath100 ( constant external pressure ) the concentration dependence of @xmath101",
    "allows to study mit under the action of external influences : temperature change , photoeffect and magnetic field .",
