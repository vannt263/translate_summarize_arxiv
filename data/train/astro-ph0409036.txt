    "= 9 mm    since the discovery of a precise relationship between the absolute magnitude at maximum light and decline rate @xcite , type ia supernova light curves have become the most accurate method to measure luminosity distances to objects at cosmological distances .",
    "the standard measure of the decline rate in the notation of phillips , , is the number of magnitudes that a type ia supernova declines in the 15 days after the time of @xmath2-band maximum .",
    "is now one of many methods used to calibrate absolute magnitudes of type ia sne ( supernovae ) .",
    "these include a modification of the  method to incorporate @xmath3 data by fitting discrete templates @xcite ; a similar multi - color technique using a continuous set of multi - color templates with the important additions of a self - calibrated error model @xcite ; and a method that parameterizes the @xmath4 light curves by `` stretching '' the time axis to fit any given light curve set to a single template set @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have shown that useful information such as reddening can be derived from plots of the filter by filter magnitudes vs. the photometric _ colors _ ( instead of vs. time ) , using data from the month after maximum light .",
    "all these techniques rely on fitting optical multi - color light curves to a template set which includes a single parameter which is independently correlated to the intrinsic luminosity of the sn .    until recently type ia sne were primarily observed through the @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( kron - cousins ) bands .",
    "@xcite has added the @xmath6 filter to the light curve sets and presents @xmath7 data for 44 objects .",
    "the @xmath6-band data are particularly important for cosmology , because many high - redshift sne are measured in the @xmath8- and @xmath9-bands , which may correspond to rest frame @xmath6-band light curves depending on the redshift .",
    "the @xmath6-band light curves are sensitive to the the metallicity of the progenitor if the @xmath6-band light curve is measured before maximum light @xcite .",
    "the compilation of near - ir ( infrared ) light curves of type ia sne has been slow due to a lag in ir detector technology with respect to optical ccd detectors and the lack of telescopes dedicated to ir observations .",
    "the caltech infrared group @xcite presented the first extensive observations of type ia sne in the near infrared .",
    "a complete summary of ir observations obtained through 1998 is given by @xcite .",
    "in their fig .",
    "6 @xcite show an @xmath10-band hubble diagram and comment that type ia sne at maximum light may be good standard candles .",
    "@xcite analyzed the ir data available four years ago and used cepheid determinations of the distances to eight galaxies which have hosted type ia sne , concluding that the dispersion in absolute magnitude 14 days after t(@xmath11 ) was @xmath120.15 mag over the decline rate range 0.87 @xmath13  @xmath13 1.31 .",
    "@xcite presented the first hubble diagrams for type ia sne based on @xmath0 magnitudes at maximum light .",
    "their data indicate that there are no obvious decline - rate relations in the near - ir if we consider the objects with  @xmath14 1.7 .",
    "thus , rather than standardizable candles , type ia sne _ at maximum light _",
    "are excellent standard candles .",
    "the dispersions in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light are roughly @xmath15 0.15 mag for the near - ir @xmath0 bands .",
    "the near - ir data have the extra advantage that extinction by interstellar dust is up to an order of magnitude less at ir wavelengths compared to optical bands @xcite . even for objects significantly reddened at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the extinction corrections are small in the ir , thus eliminating a previously serious potential source of random and systematic error in the distance determinations .",
    "there are other advantages to using the near - ir magnitudes in conjunction with the optical ones . in our papers",
    "i through v we discussed the use of the @xmath16 _ minus _ near - ir loci for type ia sne . except in the unusual case of sn",
    "2000cx ( paper iv ) we found that the unreddened loci of @xmath17 or @xmath18 allowed the determination of a@xmath19 with smaller random errors and less worry about systematic errors .",
    "this is because : 1 ) unreddened type ia sne appear to exhibit predictable @xmath16 _ minus _ near - ir color curves , allowing us to derive sensible color excesses for objects which are reddened ; and 2 ) the total extinction a@xmath19 is equal to these color excesses to a factor of about 1.3 .",
    "thus we can use , say , @xmath18 , as a method of measuring a@xmath19 without introducing a significant uncertainty due to a non - standard extinction law . since r@xmath19 can be as low as 1.8",
    "( see paper i for a discussion of sn  1999cl ) , serious systematic errors of distance can result if one uses only optical data and assumes r@xmath19 = 3.1 to convert @xmath20 into a@xmath19 .    a final advantage to the use of colors such as @xmath17 or @xmath18 can be made by appealing to our experience with measuring stellar effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "a color based on two filters close in wavelength such as @xmath21 is a very sensitive function of @xmath22 but also the metallicity of the photosphere .",
    "a color such as @xmath23 is also sensitive to metallicity , but because of the very large wavelength difference between the bands , the effect of temperature is much larger making the metallicity effect secondary .",
    "we are far from understanding the continuum formation of complicated non - hydrogen nlte photosphere of a type ia sn , but the observed range in color and ionization seen at maximum light can be explained by a simple temperature sequence where the more luminous sne are hotter @xcite . if this were true , by using a color such as @xmath18 , which may be a less complicated function of t@xmath24 rather than @xmath21 , we may be able to uncover a clearer relationship between the observed colors and the underlying physical temperature and luminosity .    since 1999",
    "we have been engaged in regular monitoring of bright type ia sne ( typically @xmath25 ) , at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) and las campanas observatory ( lco ) with the goal to construct a near - ir hubble diagram with a sample of 30 type ia sne .",
    "we are motivated by the success of the caln / tololo sn survey @xcite which published a similar number of optical light curves of type ia sne . given the importance of high redshift sne for cosmology , i.e. evidence for a non - zero cosmological constant @xcite , a well - calibrated sample of nearby sne studied in the near - infrared will allow us to better understand the dereddened properties of the population of type ia sne , and ultimately allow us to better anchor the distant sample to the nearby one .",

    "three of these objects were discovered by one of us ( rc ) as part of an ongoing sn search with a 0.3-m f/2.7 telescope sited at runion island ( latitude = s 2106@xmath26 , longitude = e 5536@xmath26 ) . except for sn  1991bg ,",
    "the group of supernovae presented in this paper has a  decline rate close to the median value for all type ia sne . in that sense , this is a `` normal '' group of type ia supernovae which should be representative of the average population .",
    "we used @xcite standards for the calibration of our optical photometry .",
    "the field star magnitudes were derived from aperture photometry in the iraf environment .",
    "typically , we derive the photometry of the sne themselves using point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes using daophot @xcite . when necessary , we first performed image subtraction using templates taken after the sne have faded away .",
    "some of our subtractions were carried out with a script based on andrew phillips iraf package psfmatch , while others were carried out using a script written by brian schmidt and based on the algorithm of @xcite .    except for the case of sn  1991bg",
    ", we calibrated the ir magnitudes of the field stars near the sne using the near - ir standards of @xcite and observations from the lco 1-m telescope .",
    "we have found that the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) magnitudes of field stars brighter than 15th magnitude are , on average , 0.03 mag brighter than the derived @xmath27 , @xmath10 , and @xmath28 photometry on the system of @xcite with this offset we were able to assess the quality of the photometry of the field stars if they were observed by us on few photometric nights .",
    "the photometry of the local standards is given in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the finding charts are shown in figures [ find_chart]a through [ find_chart]e .",
    "photometry of a given sn , obtained with multiple telescopes , shows systematic differences from telescope to telescope",
    ". often this amounts to several hundredths of a magnitude , but once a sn begins to enter the nebular phase two to three weeks after maximum light , these systematic differences can amount to several tenths of a magnitude . in papers",
    "iii , iv , and v we used a method of spectroscopically - based filter corrections to correct the photometry for the non - stellar spectral energy distributions of the sne and the differences of the filter transmission curves of the filters in different instruments .",
    "the problem of bringing the photometry of type ia sne onto a standard system was discussed by @xcite , and a correction - the `` s - correction '' method - was given in @xcite ; the reader should consult this paper for the definition of the linear transformations .",
    "we have found , for example , comparing yalo and ctio 0.9-m @xmath2-band photometry of type ia sne , that starting some 30 days after the time of @xmath2-band maximum there is a systematic difference of 0.07 mag owing to the filter differences . in the @xmath16-band",
    "the systematic differences are 0.05 mag , but with the opposite arithmetic sense . without taking this into account yalo photometry",
    "gives @xmath21 colors 0.12 mag different in the tail of the color curve .",
    "this clearly makes a significant difference if one derives a @xmath21 color excess from photometry at this epoch .",
    "as found by @xcite in the case of sn  2001el , these systematic differences can be largely eliminated by correcting the photometry to the system described by @xcite .",
    "the applications of s - corrections to date have only reduced the systematic errors of the photometry taken on different telescopes , not eliminated them .",
    "@xcite suggests that these theoretical corrections are never as good as one would hope due to the difficulty of measuring the instrument / filter / detector system efficiencies and that the real s - corrections should be calculated empirically as the observed differences of the photometry obtained with different telescopes and instruments",
    ". however , there are very few sne which have been well sampled with multiple telescopes , so we can not yet set up appropriate look up tables .    in figs .",
    "[ scorr_bv ] and [ scorr_ri ] we show optical filter corrections to the @xcite system , while in fig .",
    "[ scorr_jhk ] we show ir corrections from the yalo filters to the system of @xcite .",
    "the trends in these figures are not precise , and it is very important to get spectral atlases of other sne to see if the s - corrections of other sne approximate what we find in the cases of sne 1999ee , 2001el , and 2002bo .",
    "the filters and ccds used in the ctio 1.5-m ccd camera are nominally the same as those in the 0.9-m camera .",
    "we have assumed that the s - corrections derived for the @xmath7 filters are the same for the two cameras .",
    "our principal goal with the photometry of the five supernovae of mid - range decline rates discussed in this paper is to derive color excesses ( i.e. e(b@xmath29v ) , giving extinction corrections ) and infrared magnitudes at maximum light .",
    "the photometry _ presented in the tables _ includes the color corrections based on observations of standard stars .",
    "for further analysis we have applied the s - corrections and k - corrections to all our data where possible , the one exception being the steward ir data for sn  1999ek where we do not have a good prescription for the system throughputs . in the case of sn",
    "2002bo we explicitly list the s - corrections ( tables 12 and 13 ) .",
    "the ir k - corrections are based on spectra of sn  1999ee and are given in paper v.    we have used a new program to carry out the @xmath30m@xmath31 analysis @xcite , which is a variant on the method given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 light curves of a given sn are fitted simultaneously , minimizing a @xmath33 statistic constructed as the difference between the data and the model ( i.e. templates in each filter plus magnitudes at maximum ) , weighted by the uncertainties in the data and model .",
    "the parameters of the fit ( unknown variables ) are : the time of @xmath2-band maximum , the magnitudes at maximum in each filter ( @xmath32 ) , the value of @xmath30m@xmath31 , and the total reddening e(@xmath21)@xmath34 .",
    "the host reddening is simply the total reddening minus the galactic reddening given by @xcite .",
    "the new   code uses the same 6 templates based on 7 objects that were used by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , along with the well - sampled light curves of 8 type ia sne observed more recently .",
    "the code adopts k - corrections similar to those described by @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous versions of @xmath30m@xmath31 analysis , the prieto code allows for a continuous variation of @xmath30m@xmath31 .",

    "while the observations of sn  1991bg presented here and those of sn  1999by by @xcite and @xcite do not allow us to constrain fully the ir maxima of these two objects , because of the rarity of the fast declining type ia sne and the paucity of ir data on these objects , some comments are in order .",
    "firstly , sn  1999by was observed close enough to maximum light that we can derive @xmath10- and @xmath49-band maxima for sn  1999by .",
    "the @xmath48-band maximum of sn  1999by was likely no more than 0.1 mag brighter than the observation made 2 days prior to t(@xmath11 ) .",
    "likewise , the @xmath0 observations of sn  1991bg 0.85 days after t(@xmath44 ) must have been less than 0.1 mag from the ir maxima .",
    "thus , we can compare the luminosities and intrinsic colors of two fast decliners ( with essentially zero host reddening ) with the larger number of type ia sne of mid - range and slow decline rates .",

    "we note that in spite of the peculiarities of the light curves and implied color excesses of sn  2002bo , the small _ infrared _ extinction corrections and the uniformity of ir absolute magnitudes at maximum give this object ir absolute magnitudes similar to `` normal '' type ia sne .    in table 17",
    "we give the mean absolute magnitudes of our growing sample of type ia sne and the 1-@xmath35 distribution widths .",
    "this is an update of the corresponding table of @xcite .",
    "none of the numbers has changed significantly .    not only is the extinction much lower in the near - ir compared to the rest frame optical bands , but we can use the @xmath0 infrared templates to derive the maximum magnitudes if data are taken in the time frame of @xmath2912 to + 10 days with respect to t(@xmath11 ) . if the implied distances of high redshift sne derived from _",
    "rest frame _ @xmath48- or @xmath10-band photometry are in agreement with the distances derived from rest frame @xmath71 photometry , that will increase our confidence in the adopted extinction corrections .",
    "also , it will give us confidence that type ia sne that exploded billions of years ago are fundamentally the same type of objects we now observe in nearby galaxies .    because type ia sne are standard candles in the near - ir , except for the objects with the largest possible decline rates , it would be ideal if high - redshift supernovae are observed in the @xmath72 or @xmath73bands so that we might exploit the advantages of observing these important objects at least in the rest frame @xmath48-band .",
    "the ir bandpasses are closer to notch filters than the optical bands , and we would expect that the k - corrections should be small at `` magic '' redshifts where the @xmath48 band redshifts to the effective wavelength of @xmath10 or @xmath49 , or the @xmath10 band redshifts to @xmath49 .",

    "the absolute magnitudes near maximum light in the ir of these two objects were essentially the same , and roughly half a magnitude fainter than type ia sne of mid - range and slow decline rates .",
    "@xcite have shown that sn  2002bo exhibited unusual seds . as a result",
    ", we can not confidently derive a value of the extinction ( a@xmath19 ) toward this object , because we can not compare its colors to other objects with similar seds which are known to be unreddened .",
