    "graphene , a single atomic layer of crystalline carbon on the honeycomb lattice that consists of two interpenetrating triangular sublattices a and b , has opened up a new field for fundamental studies and applications  @xcite .",
    "peculiar electronic properties of graphene give rise to the possibility of overcoming the limitations of the silicon - based electronic  @xcite .",
    "the electronic spectrum in graphene contains two zero energy at @xmath0 and @xmath1 points of the brillouin zone , which are called the valleys or dirac points .",
    "the massless dirac - like carriers in graphene have almost semi - ballistic transport behavior with small resistance , due to the suppression of the back - scattering process  @xcite .",
    "the mobility of the carriers in graphene is quite high @xcite , and is much higher than the electron mobility revealed in the semiconductor hetrostructures @xcite .    in graphene sheets",
    "the type of particle ( electrons or holes ) and the density of the carriers can be controlled by tuning a gate bias voltage @xcite . in a gapless graphene electrical conduction",
    "can not be switched off by using the control voltages @xcite , which is essential for the operation of conventional transistors .",
    "one can overcome such difficulties by generating a gap in the electronic spectrum .",
    "the band gap is a measure of the threshold voltage and the on - off ratio of the field effect transistors @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to induce a band gap at the dirac points in order to control the transport of the carriers and integrating graphene into the semiconductor technology . consequently , band gap engineering in graphene is a current topic of much interest with fundamental and applied significance @xcite .    in the literature several routes",
    "have been proposed and applied to induce and to control a gap in graphene .",
    "one of them is using quantum confined geometries , such as quantum dots or nanoribbons @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the gap values increase by decreasing of the nanoribbon width . an alternative way is spin - orbit coupling whose origin is due to both intrinsic spin - orbit interactions , or the rashba interaction @xcite . yet",
    "another method to generate a gap in graphene sheets is through an inversion symmetry breaking of the sublattice , when the number of the electrons on a and b atoms are different @xcite , e.g. , graphene placement on proper substrates @xcite .",
    "graphene superlattices , on the other hand , may be fabricated by adsorbing adatoms on graphene surface by positioning and aligning impurities with scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , or by applying a local top gate voltage to graphene @xcite . the transition of hitting massless particles in a clean @xcite or disordered @xcite graphene - based superlattice structure has been studied .",
    "it is shown that the conductivity of the system depends on the superlattice structural parameters .",
    "furthermore , the superlattice structure of the graphene nanoribbons was recently studied by using first - principles density - functional theory calculations @xcite .",
    "these calculations showed that the magnetic ground state of the constituent ribbons , the symmetry of the junction , and their functionalization by adatoms represent structural parameters to the electronic and magnetic properties of such structures .",
    "it would , therefore , be worthwhile to investigate how the conductance of graphene superlattice junctions are affected by a gap opening at the dirac points .    in this paper",
    "we consider the sublattice symmetry - breaking mechanism due to the fact that the densities of the particles associated with the on - site energy for a and b sublattices are different or , equivalently , consider the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction for a gap opening in a clean graphene superlattice .",
    "we investigate the transmission probability of the dirac fermions through the system . in the cases of a single barrier and double barrier , exact analytical analysis",
    "are carried out for calculating the transmission probability .",
    "in addition , we show that the group delay time is different from the dwell time for a system that consists of a gap opening .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the theory and method",
    "are discussed in section 2 .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are given in sec .",

    "we consider a graphene with a peculiar gap opening due to the sublattice symmetry breaking , where the 2d massive dirac fermions at low energy is described by noninteracting hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 .",

    "the coordinate of the @xmath13th interface is labeled by @xmath14 where , @xmath15d+integer[\\frac{i-1}{2 } ] l$ ] .",
    "the schematic diagram of the electronic spectrum of the gapped graphene is shown in fig . 1 ( top graph ) as well . due to the difference between the fermi energy and the band structure between two graphene strips ,",
    "the potential profile of the system is the multiple quantum well structure which is described by @xmath16    to solve the transport problem in a graphene superlattice , we assume that the incident electron propagates at angle @xmath17 along the @xmath12 axis ( see fig .",

    "it should be noted that the transmission coefficients for the gapless graphene @xcite is revealed by setting @xmath51 in eqs .",
    "( 2)-(5 ) .",
    "after the transmission coefficients are obtained , the conductivity of the system is computed by means of the bttiker formula @xcite , taking the integral of @xmath52 over the angle , @xmath53 where @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the width of the graphene strip along the @xmath56 direction .",
    "let us first consider a system composed a single barrier .",
    "the wave functions in the different regions can be written as @xmath57 it should be noted that since the interface is located along the @xmath56 , due to the conservation of the momentum we have , @xmath58 . after some straightforward calculations , the electronic transmission probability , @xmath59 , through the barrier is obtained , resulting in @xmath60 where @xmath61    it is useful to investigate the conditions under which the transmission probability approaches unity . we find from eq . ( [ t ] ) that when @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is an integer ) , the barrier becomes entirely transparent , and does not depend on the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the same condition at the normal incidence was obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] .    for a double - barrier system , the calculation of the transmission would be difficult . in this case",
    "we restrict the calculations to the case , @xmath64 .",

    "below , we find some critical gap values for which @xmath71 , and show that the critical points are in good agreement with the results calculated by the analytical expressions .      in this section",
    "we study tunneling through the single barrier and calculate two important tunneling times , the group delay time @xmath72 , and the dwell time @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the two times was first studied by winful @xcite for a one - dimensional electron gas system .",
    "it was shown that there is a difference between the two times in the conventional electron gas systems . using the energy derivative of the transmission phase shift @xcite , the group delay time is obtained through @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , and the group delay time in reflection is given by , @xmath76 . here , @xmath77",

    "the wave functions are described by @xmath88 in front of the barrier and @xmath89 for behind the barrier .",
    "therefore , the right - hand side of eq .",

    "consequently , the relationship between @xmath91 and @xmath92 is obtained by @xmath93 the @xmath92 differs from the @xmath92 and they are no longer the same in the presence of the gap values .",
    "note that the energy of a quasiparticle is , @xmath94 .",
    "the dwell time becomes equal to the group delay time by setting @xmath51 .",
    "the last result is in contrast to the result obtained for a conventional 2d electron gas system , where the dwell time equals the group delay time plus a self interference term , which comes from the overlap of the incident and reflected waves in front of the barrier .",
    "we evaluated the electronic transmission probability and conductance in the gapped graphene through a finite number of potential barriers , as a function of the gap value introduced in the system . in all of the numerical calculations we assumed that the wavelength of the incident electron is @xmath95 nm and @xmath96 mev .",
    "in all the figures @xmath97 scales in mev .",
    "we first calculated the transmission probability of the charge carriers through the graphene structure with a double barrier , @xmath98 , with the barrier width @xmath99 nm . figure 2 shows the transmission probability of the incident electrons hitting a graphene superlattice as a function of the angle @xmath17 for several values of the gap values , @xmath97 , with ( a ) @xmath100 nm and ( b ) @xmath101 nm , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath102 behaves non - monotonically with the increase of the energy gap value at @xmath64 .",
    "it shows that the klein tunneling is no longer applicable when there is a band gap in graphene .",
    "it should be noted that the kelin tunneling predicts that the chiral massless carrier can pass through a high electrostatic potential barrier with probability one , regardless of the height and width of the barrier at normal incidence .",
    "in addition , to verify the dependence on the well width of the transmission probability , we calculated the electronic transmission for the several values of the parameter @xmath103 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "2(b ) .    to verify the behavior of the electronic transmission probability at normal incidence , the calculated transmission probability as a function of the band gap value for the several numbers of the potential barriers is shown in fig .",
    "the structural parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "the results for a single barrier , @xmath104 , show that when @xmath97 increases the transmission probability exhibits a minimum at @xmath105 mev , and then it reaches unity at the critical value given by , @xmath106 mev .",
    "the critical gap values entirely coincide with the results calculated analytically . in the case of",
    "@xmath64 we found analytically that , @xmath107 , which is supported by the numerical calculations .",
    "in the case of the double barrier , @xmath98 , there are three @xmath108 values with which @xmath102 becomes exactly unity . for the system that consists of an even number of the potential barriers , we found that the superlattice is fully transparent ( @xmath109 ) , when the energy gap is @xmath110 mev .",
    "note that the critical value of the band gap @xmath108 depends on the superlattice structural parameters , as we show numerically in fig .",
    "3(b ) , where @xmath101 nm . the number of the maxima at which the transmission amplitude becomes unity increases with increasing the number of the potential barriers .",
    "we also studied that how the structural parameters affect the transmission of the system .",
    "figure 4 presents @xmath111 as a function of the well width for the several values of the barrier width .",
    "the number of the potential barriers is @xmath98 , and the value of gap was chosen as @xmath112 mev .",
    "the numerically calculated @xmath111 is in good agreement with the result obtained analytically using eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the transmission probability approaches unity only for the specific values , @xmath113 at @xmath99 mev .",
    "however , when @xmath114 or 80 mev , the transmission probability is independent of the parameter @xmath103 at normal incidence angle , and always approaches unity .",
    "the numerical results predict that the transmission probability at normal incidence angle to be unity for the case that @xmath115 , and is independent of @xmath103 .",
    "however , when @xmath116 , the transmission probability would be unity if @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the transmission probability depends strongly on the structural parameters in the gapped graphene superlattice .    finally , we calculated the electronic conductance as a function of @xmath97 for the various numbers of the potential barriers .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "finite - size scaling analysis indicates that @xmath118 tends to a nonzero constant at @xmath119 mev .",
    "moreover , there is a domain value of @xmath97 for which the conductivity attains its maximum value . according to the above discussions ,",
    "it is clear that the conductivity of the system depends on the superlattice structural parameters , such as @xmath103 and @xmath120 .",
    "importantly , we would like to stress that the electronic conductance can reach a maximum value by selecting the proper gap and the barrier width .",
    "we evaluated the electronic conductance in gapped graphene with a finite number of potential barriers .",
    "an exact analytic expression was derived for the electronic transmission probability in a system with a single or two barrier , and the critical values of the gap at which the transmission probability equals unity were computed .",
    "we showed that the group delay time is not the same as the dwell time in a gapped graphene that consists of a barrier .",
    "however , they are the same in a gapless graphene .",
    "it should be noted that the extension of the dwell time for a superlattice structure needs intensive computations , and will be reported in future .",
    "moreover , we showed that the conductance can attain its maximum for a domain value of gaps around the critical value .",
    "in addition , the conductance of the system depends on the superlattice structural parameters and , therefore , one may design a very good electronic device by selecting the proper gap and the barrier width .",
    "thus , the system with a proper arrangement might be of use in electronic or electromagnetic devices .",
    "finally , the present calculations may be improved to investigate the spin dependence of the conductance .",
