    "we shall consider two limits of the @xmath0 spin chain from the point of view of random walks of vicious walkers , as well as from a viewpoint of enumeration of boxed plane partitions .",
    "let us begin with the @xmath0 model defined on one - dimensional lattice consisting of @xmath6 sites labeled by elements of the set @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding spin hamiltonian is defined , in absence of external magnetic field , as follows : @xmath9 where the parameter @xmath10 describes the internal anisotropy of the model .",
    "for instance , the choice @xmath11 corresponds to , so - called , isotropic @xmath12 spin chain solved in @xcite .",

    "the case of the @xmath5 magnet can also be deduced by taking the limit of infinite on - site repulsion in the boson hubbard model ( the `` hard - core '' bosons ) @xcite .",

    "it follows from ( [ xxwf1 ] ) that the wave function is not equal to zero if and only if the elements @xmath40 , @xmath90 , satisfy the _",

    "it is crucial that in the considered limit the occupation of nearest sites is forbidden , and the _ hard - core diameter _",

    "the set of points on the horizontal axis just provides the strict partition @xmath88 .",
    "for instance , the diagram on figure  1 is drown for @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and we have got respectively : @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in our paper we shall study the thermal correlation function of the states ( would be called as _ ferromagnetic strings _ ) with no spins down on the last @xmath126 sites of the lattice .",
