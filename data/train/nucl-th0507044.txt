    "before we discuss the details of our results , some general remarks are in order .",
    "the basic strategy of our model approach is to start with the nucleon plus meson - exchange currents and add the resonances one by one as needed in the fitting procedure until one achieves a reasonable fit of the new @xmath1 photoproduction data obtained by the clas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we allow for both spin-1/2 and resonances in our model . our quantitative criterion for a reasonable fit was to discard all fits with a @xmath100 per data point of @xmath101 , which is supported by the fact that fits with @xmath102 much larger than 1.3 are noticeably of inferior fit quality even for the naked eye . under this criterion",
    ", we found that one needs at least four resonances in order to obtain a reasonable fit in the present approach .",
    "we find , in particular , that , in addition to spin-1/2 resonances , spin-3/2 resonances are necessary to achieve acceptable fits . in this respect , we emphasize that the saphir data  @xcite analyzed in ref .  @xcite",
    "have rather large error bars . while not entirely incompatible with the new high - precision clas data @xcite , they clearly are less constraining than the clas data , which may explain why there was no need for spin-3/2 resonances in our previous work .    as we have pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross - section data alone are unable to pin down the model parameters and , therefore , one finds different sets of parameters which fit the data equally well .",
    "note that this is not due to the uncertainties in the data , but simply because , intrinsically , the cross sections do not impose enough stringent constraints on the fit .",
    "in particular , for each resonance , the resulting fitted mass value depends to a certain extent on its starting value in the fitting procedure .",
    "the starting ( resonance ) mass values we consider here generally are around those advocated by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite .    in the present work , in the case of those resonances that can be identified with known pdg resonances , we have taken into account only the corresponding dominant branching ratios @xmath66 from the pdg for hadronic decays when this information is available ( and we ignored the fact that some of the quoted branching ratios are subject to large uncertainties ) .",
    "if no information is available , we consider only the @xmath103 partial decay , with the corresponding branching ratio @xmath104 as a free fit parameter .",
    "apart from these branching ratios , we also consider the @xmath98 branching ratio @xmath99 which is calculated from the product of the coupling constants @xmath105 in conjunction with the assumed branching ratio @xmath96 for the radiative decay . in the following tables , therefore , @xmath99 is not an independent fit parameter , but rather a parameter extracted from the fitted values of the product @xmath105 .",
    "one might expect that the way in which the energy dependence is implemented in the resonance width in the present work [ cf.eqs .",
    "( [ eq : width2])([eq : widthg ] ) ] may introduce a considerable uncertainty in the final results .",
    "however , we find that the cross sections are not very sensitive to our assumptions in this respect .",
    "in fact , we also re - ran some of the cross - section fits discussed below using step functions for the widths that switch on the full partial widths at the corresponding thresholds without any smooth energy dependence and we found that the parameter sets obtained in this way were fairly close to the ones reported here . for spin observables ,",
    "however , this insensitivity does not hold true . in particular , the beam and target asymmetries are rather sensitive to how the energy dependence of the width is treated and one must be careful then when confronting model predictions with the data when the latter should become available .",

    "in fact , in a very extreme case , we have obtained a fit value as large as @xmath130 .",
    "it is obvious , therefore , that a more unambiguous extraction of this coupling constant requires going to an energy region where the resonance contributions are small .",

    "see the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : rall ] for the meaning of the different curves . ]",
    "we have analyzed the new clas  @xcite data of the @xmath143 reaction within an approach based on a relativistic meson - exchange model of hadronic interactions .",
    "the present model is an extension of the one reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and it includes the nucleonic and the mesonic as well as the nucleon - resonance currents .",
    "the latter includes both spin-1/2 and resonance contributions in contrast to our previous work  @xcite , where only spin-1/2 resonances were considered . in addition",
    ", we employ energy - dependent resonance widths in the present work .",
    "the resulting reaction amplitude is fully gauge invariant .",
    "we have shown that the mesonic as well as the spin-1/2 and resonance currents are important to describe the existing data quantitatively .",
    "the observed angular distribution is due to delicate interference effects between the different currents . in our analysis ,",
    "most of the resulting resonances may be identified with known resonances  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that one should be cautious with such an identification of the resonances .",
    "as we have seen , the cross - section data alone do not impose enough constraints for an unambiguous determination of the resonance parameters . in this connection",
    ", we have shown that the beam and target asymmetries can help impose more stringent constraints .",
    "furthermore , there is a possibility that some of the resonances in the present work are mocking up background contributions , especially those due to the final - state interaction , which is not taken into account explicitly in our calculation .",
    "obviously , effects of the final - state interaction should be investigated in future work before a conclusive identification of the resonances can be made .",
    "we have predicted a bump structure in the total cross section at @xmath144 gev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ralltot ] ) .",
    "if this is confirmed , the @xmath124 and/or @xmath125 resonance may be responsible for this bump .",
    "our study also shows that the nucleonic current should be relatively small .",
    "however , contrary to the expectation in our earlier work  @xcite , the new high - precision cross - section data do not allow to pin down this current contribution due to the possible presence of resonance currents , especially of the @xmath5 resonance , which can also lead to an enhancement of the cross section for backward angles at higher energies , a feature that otherwise arises from the @xmath8-channel nucleonic current contribution .",
    "these complications notwithstanding , assuming that for the very high end of the present data set resonance contributions can be neglected , we argue in sec .  [",
    "sec : etaprimecoupling ] that the upper limit of @xmath145 can now be lowered to a value of @xmath146 , whereas our previous analysis @xcite had suggested an upper limit of @xmath147 .",
    "further corroboration of this finding is needed .    in this respect",
    ", it should be noted that the result pertaining here to the @xmath10 coupling constant is , of course , a model - dependent one .",
    "indeed , what is relevant in our calculations is the product of @xmath145 and the associated hadronic form factor which accounts for the off - shellness of the intermediate nucleon .",
    "moreover , our @xmath10 coupling constant is defined at the on - mass - shell point , i.e. , @xmath148 while the coupling required in eq .",
    "( [ spinfrac ] ) in connection with the origin of the nucleon spin is at @xmath149 .",
    "since the @xmath1 meson is a relatively heavy meson ( @xmath150mev ) , we would expect that @xmath151 will be considerably smaller than its value at @xmath30 because of the presence of the form factor which usually cut down the coupling strength .",
    "therefore , we might well expect that the @xmath29 coupling at @xmath149 to be negligibly small , consistent with zero .",
    "we have also shown that the mesonic current contribution can not be fixed unambiguously from the existing cross - section data because of the possible presence of the resonance currents , especially the @xmath5 resonance . a possibility to determine the @xmath6-channel current is to measure the cross sections at higher energies where the resonance contributions becomes negligible .",
    "furthermore , we have found that using a regge trajectory in the @xmath6-channel instead of explicit meson exchanges yields overall fit qualities that are , at best , comparable to those obtained with meson exchanges .",
    "this indicates that explicit @xmath46 and @xmath47 exchanges , as employed here , are completely adequate to describe the @xmath6-channel degrees of freedom at the present energies .",
    "finally , the results of the present work should provide useful information for further investigations , both experimentally and theoretically , of the @xmath152 reaction .",
    "in particular , measurements of cross sections at smaller forward and larger backward angles than are available in the present data set would already help constrain the model parameters considerably , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rall ] .",
    "total cross sections should also be measured in order to confirm or dismiss the bump structures , especially around @xmath123 gev , predicted in the present calculation .",
    "in addition , it is expected that measurements of spin observables  such as beam and target asymmetries shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinbt ]  would impose more stringent limits on the range of permissible parameters and this would undoubtedly provide a much improved description of the resonances and their properties in the energy region covered by the existing data . from the theoretical side , it is possible that the nucleon resonances introduced in the present work are mocking up the background contributions not taken into account in the calculation . in this connection , it is extremely interesting to investigate effects of the final - state interaction which has not been treated explicitly in the present calculation .",
    "unfortunately , at present no realistic model is available that can provide the relevant @xmath153 final - state interaction .",
    "in addition , effects of higher - spin resonances that have been ignored in the present analysis should be investigated in the future .",

    "we are guided by the following motivation .",
    "as in the spin-1/2 case of ( [ eq : spin1 ] ) , we want to describe the spin in terms of the elementary operators , i.e. , we want to preserve the numerator structure of ( [ eq : s3prop ] ) _ and _ the symmetry between the rs tensors @xmath54 and @xmath169 . in a schematic matrix notation",
    ", we therefore make the ansatz @xmath170 putting , in analogy to the denominator of the spin-1/2 case ( [ eq : spin1 ] ) ,      with the operators @xmath160 and @xmath172 to be determined such that the second equality in ( [ eq : deltacondition ] ) holds true , i.e. , @xmath173 multiplying this equation by @xmath174 from both sides , one immediately finds the condition @xmath175 in view of eq .",
    "( [ eq : propcond ] ) and the fact that on - shell , at @xmath176 and acting on a spin-3/2 eigenstate , the propagator must provide the width information , we find that the ansatz @xmath177 satisfies all constraints .",

    "we thus have          the inversion here is to be performed on the full 16-dimensional space of lorentz indices and component indices .",
    "there are various equivalent ways to do this ; we have done it by introducing indices @xmath180 where @xmath181 are the lorentz indices and @xmath182 are the component indices , and defining @xmath183 numerator and denominator matrices by @xmath184 and @xmath185 respectively . numerically inverting the denominator matrix @xmath186 , we then calculate the spin-3/2 propagator as @xmath187 where @xmath188 and summation over @xmath46 is implied , as usual .",
