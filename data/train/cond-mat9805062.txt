    "the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) is now well established as a selective probe of the magnetic properties even in complex systems .",
    "xmcd can yield local quantitative information through a wide range of powerful calculation techniques .",
    "for instance within the multiplet framework , the xmcd spectra at the l@xmath2 transition metal ( tm ) and m@xmath3 rare earth ( r ) edges can be accurately reproduced @xcite .",
    "it allows one to evaluate the local transition metal 3@xmath1 and rare earth 4@xmath4 magnetic moments .",
    "moreover , the sum rules @xcite can provide , in favorable cases , a separate determination of both orbital and spin magnetic moments .",
    "however these atomic approaches fail at the tm k edge , where the excited electron is promoted to the delocalized @xmath5 states .    for final delocalized band states ,",
    "the scattering processes encountered by the photoelectron can be treated in a one - electron picture within the multiple - scattering framework .",
    "this theory was first applied to the calculation of the x - ray absorption spectra , and recently it has been implemented to calculate the xmcd spectra , in particular at the transition metal k edge . since the xmcd arises from the interplay between the spin - polarization and the spin - orbit coupling , these effects have to be included in the model .",
    "@xcite used a fully relativistic multiple - scattering formalism and obtained good results in the near - edge region .",
    "this formalism was recently extended to the exafs range @xcite . on the other hand ankudinov and rehr , using a multiple - scattering approach where the scattering by the atomic sites is fully relativistic and the propagation between sites is non - relativistic , calculated the extended structure in xmcd at the l@xmath2 edges of gd in good agreement with experiments @xcite . however , in this case , the edge region was not well reproduced .",
    "more recently we performed calculations including both the near - edge and exafs regions in the same multiple - scattering formalism with application to the fe k edge @xcite .",
    "we showed that the spin - polarization of the @xmath1-states of the neighboring ions highly contributes to the signal structure and accounts for the first positive peak in the fe xmcd spectrum .",
    "this contribution arises from the scattering of the photoelectron due to the spin - orbit potential of the neighbors and the absorber .",
    "the role of the spin - orbit interaction of the 3@xmath1 states on the neighboring sites was also reported by igarashi and hirai @xcite using tight - binding calculations , and later on by guo within an itinerant electronic model @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the xmcd at the tm k edge in fe and ni is determined by the orbital moment on the 3@xmath1 states through the @xmath5-@xmath1 hybridization . by including the coulomb interaction between the 3@xmath1 electrons , the xmcd spectra seem to be quite well reproduced .",
    "if these techniques now offer a reasonable description of the dichroic spectrum in pure metals , the interpretation of the xmcd at the tm k edge in rare earth - transition metal compounds is still open . in particular",
    ", the xmcd signal in the near - edge region may present very different features with respect to the allied rare earth .",
    "recent experiments performed at the fe k edge in r@xmath6fe@xmath7b compounds were analyzed considering the xmcd spectra as the addition of the magnetic contributions of both fe and r sublattices @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that fe k edge xmcd is induced by the splitting of the 5@xmath1 band , due to the exchange interaction with the 4@xmath4 states , through the @xmath5-@xmath1 hybridization .    in the course of our studies at the l@xmath2 rare earth edges in gdni@xmath0 and tbni@xmath0 @xcite , non negligible xmcd signals compared to ni metal have been observed at the ni k edge whereas ni does not satisfy the stoner criterion in the rni@xmath0 compounds @xcite .",
    "these results give information on the rare earth influence on the dichroic spectra of the k edge of ni .",
    "however , the understanding of the xmcd at the k edge of the transition metal in r - tm intermetallics is far from being achieved and a better description of the rare earth role has yet to be given .    in this paper",
    "we report a comparative study of the co k edge xmcd spectra between co metal and rco@xmath8 metallic alloys with magnetic and non magnetic rare earth . in most of these compounds ,",
    "the co has a strong magnetic moment , in the rco@xmath0 compounds for instance , it is comparable to that of co metal .",
    "the choice of different rare earths allows us to observe the sensitivity of the xmcd spectrum to the magnetic and chemical environment of the absorbing site . for co metal , laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 ,",
    "calculations of the xmcd signal have been carried out within the multiple - scattering model using a semi - relativistic approach @xcite .",
    "these calculations require the knowledge of the atomic potential which was obtained within the local density approximation using the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) basis - set within the atomic sphere approximation and including the so called combined correction term @xcite .    the second section of the present paper deals with the xmcd experimental results observed at the co k edge in co metal and various r - co compounds .",
    "the third section presents the calculations of the crystal potentials by means of the linear muffin - tin orbital method within the local - density approximation , and the multiple - scattering calculations of the x - ray absorption and the dichroic signal of co metal , laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 .",
    "the last section summarizes and concludes our paper .",
    "like most of the rare earth - transition metal binary alloys , the r - co phase diagrams present a large number of well - defined compounds .",
    "the different crystallographic structures of these compounds are based on the cacu@xmath0-like hexagonal lattice including simple r or co atom substitutions along with layers shifts .",
    "the magnetism of the rare earth - transition metal systems has been extensively studied in the past two decades ( see for instance refs .",
    "it relies on a combination of 4@xmath4 localized and 3@xmath1 itinerant magnetism giving rise to a wide range of magnetic properties , some of them well suited for technical applications .",
    "the band structure of the r - tm metallic alloys is characterized by the hybridization of the 3@xmath1 and 5@xmath1 bands @xcite .",
    "the hybridization leads to a ferromagnetic coupling between 4@xmath4 and 3@xmath1 moments in light rare earth compounds and ferrimagnetic in heavy rare earth compounds @xcite .",
    "the hybridized states are located at the top of the 3@xmath1 band and at the bottom of the 5@xmath1 band .",
    "the fermi level lies in this region where the density of states varies strongly .",
    "starting from the pure 3@xmath1 metal , the progressive introduction of the rare earth induces a decrease in the 3@xmath1 magnetism and for given concentrations the stoner criterion is no more satisfied .",
    "the critical concentration for the onset of the 3@xmath1 magnetism is rni@xmath0 for the nickel - based alloys whereas it corresponds to rco@xmath6 for the rco@xmath8 compounds .",
    "the rco@xmath6 compounds crystallize in the mgcu@xmath6-type cubic structure ( laves phases ) . in yco@xmath6 and luco@xmath6 , co is non magnetic whereas in compounds with magnetic rare earths the co moment of about 1 @xmath9 , is induced by exchange interactions between 3@xmath1 and 4@xmath4 spins .",
    "the curie temperature reaches a maximal value of 395 k in gdco@xmath6 and rapidly decreases with the spin value of the rare earth . on the contrary , in the rco@xmath0 compounds ( cacu@xmath0-like structure ) the co moment , as deduced from magnetization studies , is approximately 1.64 @xmath9 and the strong co - co exchange interaction leads to very high curie temperatures ( t@xmath10 @xmath11 950 k ) .",
    "the extremely large co anisotropy favors the @xmath12 axis and competes with that of the rare earth .",
    "for instance in tbco@xmath0 , a spin reorientation from the basal plane to the @xmath12 axis above 440 k is observed @xcite . in the solid solutions r(ni@xmath13co@xmath8)@xmath0 , which also crystallize in the cacu@xmath0 structure ,",
    "the co magnetic moment for high @xmath14 values is comparable to that in the rco@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the curie temperatures then progressively decrease when substituting co by non magnetic ni ions .",
    "the xmcd measurements at the co k edge have been performed in laco@xmath0 , tbco@xmath0 , dy(ni@xmath15co@xmath16)@xmath0 and tbco@xmath6",
    ". their crystallographic structures and magnetic properties are reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "table [ tab2 ] gives the equivalent positions with their coordinates and the point symmetry group for the cacu@xmath0-type hexagonal structure .",
    "all these compounds were prepared at the laboratoire de magntisme louis - nel , by rf - melting in a cold crucible from the stoichiometric proportions of pure elements . in order to minimize oxidation ,",
    "the melting was performed under neutral argon atmosphere . for transmission mode xmcd experiments ,",
    "the samples were then crushed into powder and layered onto a thin kapton foil .",
    "the powders were previously analyzed by x - ray diffraction using a debye - scherrer method .",
    "the co sample consists in a thin metallic foil .",
    "the xmcd measurements were carried out at lure , on the energy dispersive beam - line d11 @xcite .",
    "the polychromator consists of a curved si(111 ) crystal which focuses the x - ray beam in the middle of the electromagnet poles .",
    "higher harmonics are rejected by a sio@xmath6 plane mirror located downstream of the photodiode array detector .",
    "right circularly polarized x - ray beam is selected by 1 mm - wide slits positioned 3 mrad below the orbit plane .",
    "the circular polarization rate of the incoming radiation is estimated at @xmath17 .",
    "the xmcd spectra are recorded in transmission mode by selecting one polarization and reversing the magnetic field , applied along the photon propagation direction .",
    "the applied magnetic field intensity is about 0.4 t. the samples are oriented so that the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the sample .",
    "for low temperature measurements ( down to 10 k ) , the sample can be mounted in a helium cryogenerator inserted between the electromagnet poles .",
    "the spectra have been measured at room temperature in co metal , laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 and at 10 k in tbco@xmath6 and dy(ni@xmath15co@xmath16)@xmath0 .",
    "the xmcd spectra at the co",
    "k edge are presented on figure [ cokexp ] for co metal , laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 along with other r - co compounds .",
    "the origin of the energy scale has been chosen at the inflexion point of the absorption edge .",
    "all xmcd spectra have been normalized to the edge jump of the absorption edge . in tbco@xmath6 and in dy(ni@xmath15co@xmath16)@xmath0 at 10 k ( @xmath18t@xmath19 ) , the magnetization of the co sublattice is smaller than the magnetization of the rare earth sublattice and antiferromagnetically coupled with it , giving rise to a reverse xmcd signal with respect to co metal or laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 compounds .",
    "in order to keep the same sign convention than in co metal the xmcd spectra of tbco@xmath6 and dy(ni@xmath15co@xmath16)@xmath0 were multiplied by -1 as indicated on figure [ cokexp ] .",
    "the dichroic signal at the co k edge in co metal exhibits a one - peak structure centered about 5 ev above the absorption edge .",
    "the full width at half maximum is about 5 ev .",
    "the xmcd spectrum of laco@xmath0 , where the rare earth is not magnetic , is close to that of co metal .",
    "it presents a negative one - peak structure at about 5 ev in addition to a weak positive contribution in the middle of the broad negative structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the xmcd spectra obtained from magnetic r - based compounds strongly contrast with that of co metal and laco@xmath0 .",
    "the dichroic signal consists of a three - peaks structure , two negative and one positive in the middle of the negative ones .",
    "the central peak exhibits now a huge amplitude , comparable to that of the negative dips . when switching from an hexagonal - based compound ( tbco@xmath0 ) to its cubic - based counterpart ( tbco@xmath6 ) , sizeable changes in the xmcd signal",
    "are also observed .",
    "the central positive feature in tbco@xmath6 seems of larger amplitude and wider than in tbco@xmath0 . at higher energy , all",
    "xmcd co k edge spectra exhibit a positive bump located about 20 ev above the absorption edge , which may be ascribed to magnetic exafs .",
    "the behavior of the xmcd signal at the co k edge in r - co compounds , with respect to co metal , clearly shows the r influence on the dichroism . in order to obtain a deeper insight into such a behavior",
    ", we performed multiple - scattering calculations at the co k edge in co metal , laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 .",
    "the co k edge xmcd spectra were calculated within the multiple - scattering framework including the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the cross section is calculated from the dirac - green function according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref.@xcite . a fully relativistic core - state wave function has been used .",
    "the determination of the cross section requires the calculation of the atomic potential which has been carried out within the self - consistent lmto approach ( see section [ sublmto ] ) .",
    "the influence of the relativistic effects , that is the spin - orbit interaction , is obtained by the series expansion of the dirac - green function .",
    "to zero - th order in @xmath20 we find the absorption cross section @xmath21 in the absence of relativistic effects .",
    "the expansion carried out up to second order in @xmath20 provides 5 terms .",

    "this term will be denoted as @xmath22 according to the notation in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to take into account the finite core - hole lifetime @xmath23",

    ", this convolution is achieved in calculating the green function for complex energies @xmath25 .",
    "we have to consider also the fact that only the transitions into the empty states , located above the fermi energy , are allowed .",
    "thus , the convolution by the @xmath24-width lorentzian must be carried out from e@xmath26 instead of @xmath27 .",
    "we will see later on that the right choice of the fermi energy is of crucial importance when comparing the calculated spectra to the experimental ones .",

    "the selfconsistent fermi level is located at -1 ev .    the calculations on rco@xmath0 class compounds were first performed on gdco@xmath0 . while not measured in the present study , this compound serves as a reference for our lmto calculations of the rco@xmath0 .",
    "the muffin - tin radii r@xmath40 of both gd and co were derived from the values given by yamaguchi and asano @xcite by expanding the radii so that the total volume occupied by the muffin - tin spheres in the unit cell is equal to the volume of the unit cell itself , while keeping the ratio r@xmath40(gd)/r@xmath40(co ) constant . under this condition , the muffin - tin spheres on two neighboring sites overlap each other . the r muffin - tin radius in the other rco@xmath0 compounds has been deduced from that of gd in gdco@xmath0 by scaling the rare earth radius to the volume of the unit cell , keeping the co muffin - tin radius constant throughout the rco@xmath0 series .",

    "the calculated spin moments on co sites , of 1.28 @xmath39co and 1.37 @xmath39co respectively on 2c and 3 g sites , are slightly smaller than those previously reported by yamaguchi and asano @xcite but agree with a larger moment on the 3 g site .",

    "the xmcd calculations have been carried out with the numerical program described in ref .",
    "the converged potential included in the multiple - scattering calculations are those calculated by lmto .",
    "the xmcd program uses touching muffin - tin spheres without overlap .",
    "the absence of overlap is required for the multiple - scattering calculations to be convergent .",
    "because of the difference in the muffin - tin radii between lmto and multiple - scattering potentials , there is an interstitial volume between the spheres in the multiple - scattering calculations .",

    "this ambiguity can be avoided by using full potential codes that do not make the muffin - tin approximation . however , no such codes are available at the moment for xmcd .    the muffin - tin radii used in the multiple - scattering calculations are presented on table [ tab3 ] . for laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 ,",
    "they have been deduced using the procedure proposed by yamaguchi and asano for gdco@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "the fermi energy of the multiple - scattering calculations is not the same as that of the lmto calculations because of the difference in the energy origin between the two approaches .",
    "the effect of the fermi energy clearly shows up , especially for the xmcd spectrum : the first two peaks have vanished and only subsists the negative peak around 5 ev .",
    "the xmcd spectrum is broadened around e@xmath26 as expected from the truncated lorentzian convolution .",
    "it may be noticed that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the xmcd spectrum calculated at the k edge in fe metal with e@xmath26=0 ev keeps a positive peak at low energy , mainly coming from the @xmath35 contribution , which fits well the derivative - like behavior of the measured xmcd spectrum . the higher fermi level found in co",
    "metal leads to the collapse of this second peaks in the near - edge region of the co k edge xmcd spectrum .",

    "the calculation reproduces rather well the structure of the absorption and xmcd experimental spectra .",
    "the calculated spectra present a slight shift to the high energies .",
    "this shift is very likely due to the difficulty to properly fit in the energy between calculated and experimental spectra . for the xmcd spectrum the calculation yields the expected one - peak feature with however a narrower width than the experimental one . in the region between 10 ev and 30 ev",
    "the calculated oscillations are not resolved in the experimental spectrum , where only a large bump is observed . the extended energy spectra are presented on figure [ coexafs ] .",
    "the slight shift in energy of the exafs oscillations is again noticed between experiment and calculation in both the absorption and the xmcd spectra .",
    "though the exafs structures are strongly damped in the measured spectra , the agreement between experiment and calculation remains rather satisfactory .",
    "the agreement in the intensity of the calculated and experimental peak around 5 ev is very likely fortuitous . indeed in the calculation",
    "the degree of circular polarization is set equal to 1 , while experimentally the polarization rate of the incoming beam , estimated at 0.65 , reduces the signal intensity .",
    "this is confirmed in the energy range 10 - 30 ev where the intensity of the calculated oscillations is to small to account for the bump observed experimentally .",
    "consequently it turns out that in the high energy region the calculated amplitude of the oscillations is always overestimated , in the dichroic spectrum but also in the absorption one .",
    "these effects might be related to a current limitation of the xmcd program which does not include the inelastic scattering processes undergone by the photoelectron in the metal .",
    "the multiple - scattering calculations in the laco@xmath0 and tbco@xmath0 compounds have been carried out on a 117 atoms cluster for each co atomic site .",
    "the total spectrum results from the weighted sum of the spectrum on each site with respect to its multiplicity in the unit cell .",

    "the reduction of @xmath35 and the phase opposition between @xmath33 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 give rise to the positive cusp located in the middle of the negative peak , characteristic of the laco@xmath0 xmcd spectrum ( cf . fig .",

    "the absorption and xmcd calculated spectra without the fermi level for tbco@xmath0 are illustrated on figure [ tbco5calc]a and [ tbco5calc]b .",
    "figure [ tbco5calc]b also shows the contributions of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 to the total xmcd cross section .",
    "the structures of the xmcd signal in the low energy region arise , as in laco@xmath0 , from @xmath35 .",
    "the first negative peak has a structure and an amplitude very similar to those obtained in laco@xmath0 or co metal .",
    "the second positive peak presents a double structure which results from the mixing of the co @xmath1 and tb @xmath1 shell positive contributions and the negative tb @xmath4 shell contribution as shown in figure [ tbco5calc]c . in figure",
    "[ tbco5calc]c are represented only the contributions to the @xmath35 cross section from the @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 shells of the tb first neighbors and the @xmath1 shell of the co first neighbors .",
    "the addition of the contributions , of smaller intensity , coming from the other atoms of the cluster does not change quantitatively the structure of the spectra .",
    "it may be noted that the tb @xmath4 shell contribution is not negligible in the near edge region .",
    "compared to the laco@xmath0 xmcd spectra , the third negative peak around 5 ev comes almost exclusively from @xmath35 . in this energy region @xmath33 and @xmath34 having roughly the same amplitude and opposite sign cancel each other .",
    "this negative structure can be mainly assigned to the tb @xmath1 shell contribution .",
    "this contribution along with the tb @xmath5 and @xmath4 contributions , of lower intensity , give rise also to the positive bump in @xmath35 which immediately follows the negative peak .",
    "when the fermi level is included in the calculation , the structures near the absorption edge are smeared out .",
    "the calculated spectra which best fit with the experimental ones are obtained with e@xmath26=3 ev .",
    "experimental and calculated spectra are presented in figure [ tbco5calcexp ] .",
    "the calculated absorption spectrum presents structures which are not resolved in the experimental one .",
    "the calculated dichroic spectrum was scaled to the experimental one . as for laco@xmath0",
    ", this correction accounts for the non - saturation of the magnetization .",
    "the two peaks at 6 and 10 ev in the experimental xmcd spectrum are quite well reproduced by the calculations , in particular their widths . at higher energies ,",
    "we find incoherences again between the calculation and the measured spectrum .",
    "calculations within the multiple scattering approach of the dichroic signal at the co k edge in pure co metal reproduce with a rather good agreement the structures of the experimental spectrum .",
    "in particular the one - peak structure near the edge is well accounted for with a fermi energy of 1.2 ev .",
    "the co k edge spectrum , calculated without the fermi level presents strong similarities with the fe k edge spectrum calculated in the same conditions . in the present theoretical approach it is possible to separate the local contributions to the dichroic cross section from those coming from the surrounding atoms . when these contributions are examined it",
    "is confirmed that the scattering by the spin - orbit potential of the @xmath1 shell of the neighboring atoms creates strong structures in the low energy range of the spectrum .",
    "this is in agreement with igarashi and hirai calculations .",
    "the local contributions , atomic contribution and contribution due to the spin polarization of the @xmath5-states , give structures at higher energies typically around 5 ev .",
    "however as soon as the fermi level is introduced in the calculations , low energy structures partially ( fe ) , or completely ( co ) , disappear .",
    "present calculations show that the negative structure observed in the co metal xmcd spectrum at the co k edge results from a well balanced mixing between local , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and surrounding , @xmath35 , contribution .",
    "it may be noted that , in this energy range , the contributions to @xmath35 , arising from the spin - orbit coupling in the @xmath1 and @xmath5 shells have comparable intensities .",
    "the calculated co k edge xmcd spectra in laco@xmath0 , and tbco@xmath0 reproduce , with an excellent agreement in the near edge region , the structures of the experimental spectra . as for co metal the signal structure in laco@xmath0",
    "is accounted for by a balanced mixing between local and surrounding contributions . in this last contribution",
    "the rare earth atoms , via the spin - orbit coupling on the la @xmath1 and @xmath5 shells , significantly influence the structure . in the case of tbco@xmath0",
    "the multiple - scattering calculations stress the major role of the contributions due to the neighbors , @xmath35 in the structure of the spectrum around 5 ev .",
    "more precisely , the expansion of the @xmath35 cross section into the @xmath47 orbital components allowed us to evidence that the first negative peak in the xmcd spectrum at the co k edge originates almost exclusively from the spin - orbit potential on the tb @xmath1 states .",
    "this result points out that the structures of the xmcd spectrum at the k edge of the transition metal in the r - tm alloys are induced to a large extent by the rare earth when the rare earth is magnetic .",
    "the xmcd at the co k edge in the r - co compounds , which probes the empty @xmath5-states on co sites , thus detects the spin - orbit interaction on the rare earth @xmath1-states .",
    "this process is very likely mediated through the hybridization .",
    "the similarities observed in the density of states above the fermi level , between the tb(@xmath1 ) and the co(@xmath5)-dos in tbco@xmath0 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ tbco5doszoom ] ) underline the existence of a co(@xmath5)-r(@xmath1 ) hybridization .",
    "the closer resemblance between co-2c(@xmath5 ) and tb(@xmath1 ) is related to the shorter distance leading to a larger orbital overlapping between the co-2c  tb compared to co-3g  tb .",
    "effects of the environment can be expected to exist at the l@xmath2 edges of the transition metal as well , like in the re - tm alloys where the re(5@xmath1 ) and tm(3@xmath1 ) band are hybridized .",
    "for instance , it is very likely that magnetic exafs structure can reflect these effects and recent theoretical investigations on the magnetic exafs at the l@xmath2 edges of pure fe are very promising @xcite .",
    "however a proper experimental evidence presents great difficulties as the white lines dominate the spectra at these edges .",
    "moreover , in the soft x - ray energy range , surface defaults which are far from being negligible in the re - tm alloys may disturb the interpretation of the spectra .",
    "though the xmcd spectra are quite well reproduced in the near region , a better agreement has yet to be obtained in the exafs region both in the absorption and dichroic spectra .",
    "an improvement planned for the future is the use of an optical potential to take into account the exchange and inelastic interactions on the photoelectron .",
    "more precisely , the interpretation depends on whether we consider fully or semi - relativistic theories . in a fully relativistic framework",
    ", xmcd depends only on the projection of the relativistic photoelectron wavefunction over the @xmath5 states of the absorber . in a semi - relativistic framework ,",
    "the photoelectron is considered to propagate to all sites of the cluster , where it is scattered by the local spin - orbit interaction .",
    "when the @xmath5-component of this semi - relativistic wavefunction is calculated , it has a contribution from the non - relativistic wave function ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) and a contribution due to the spin - orbit scattering by all the atoms of the cluster ( @xmath35 ) ."
