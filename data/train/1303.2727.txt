    "<S> such behavior shows that the topological phase transition has a weak size dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the insets indicate the @xmath0 invariant for the two cases , also showing a small size dependence . however , on a small size , a stronger @xmath28 [ e.g. the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : z2_finitesize ] ( b ) ] will lead to a less sharp boundary determined by the @xmath0 invariants , compared to the @xmath94 behavior . for the same numerical accuracy </S>",
    "<S> , one can investigate the single - particle green s functions on small sizes compared to the @xmath0 invariant to determine the topological phase transition boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that the single - particle green s function can be a powerful tool in detecting topological phase transitions in interacting systems without the need to evaluate the full topological invariant . </S>",
    "<S> ( although , this should certainly be checked in a few cases as it is the precise quantity that is used to distinguish the topological and non - topological phases . )    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the single - particle excitation gap is not a reliable quantity to detect the topological phase boundary in finite - size interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle gap should close when undertaking the topological phase transition .    as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chargegap ] , however , the single particle gaps are finite at the phase transitions for @xmath95 on the finite size simulations . indeed , comparing the @xmath96 and @xmath97 systems , we can clearly see the decay tendency upon increasing size . </S>",
    "<S> the qmc results on finite size scaling up to @xmath98 confirm that around the phase boundaries the gaps vanish at @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the behavior of the gaps is subject to strong finite size effect and the feature of vanishing excitation can be only observed in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the degree to which the phase transition is obscured by the single particle gap also increases with increasing @xmath28 . with @xmath97 , for @xmath66 the gap seems to close around @xmath18 , but for @xmath91 the behavior prevents one from determining the topological phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in an interacting system , one should focus on the invariant itself and the single - particle green s function .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary._-we have studied a generalized kane - mele - hubbard model with an additional third - neighbor hopping term added . in the non - interacting limit the model exhibits a topological phase transition as a function of third - neighbor hopping . by choosing moderate hubbard interactions without inducing antiferromagnetic ordering , we study the topological phase transition in the interacting level . using a numerically exact , fermion sign - free determinant projector qmc method , we have mapped the interaction - dependence of this phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that interactions stabilize the topological phase by shifting the phase boundary to enlarge the topological region . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is absent in a static hartree - fock mean - field theory , which indicates it is entirely the quantum fluctuations associated with the interactions that enlarges the topological phase . we also show that the single - particle green s function can more accurately determine the phase boundary than the @xmath0 invariant ( which is derived from it ) for small system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> if this result can be reliably generalized , this could be a useful insight in large - scale  numerical searches \" for real materials with topological properties . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of fluctuation effects in our model also suggest that some density functional theory calculations could incorrectly predict the topological invariant of materials where quantum fluctuations are key to deciding the phase .    </S>",
