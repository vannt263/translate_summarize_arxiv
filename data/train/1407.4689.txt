    "emission of biophotons from living cells and tissues of plant and animal origin are by now very well established ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "emission of biophotons can be technically considered as a type of bioluminescence , although the observed emission of biophotons from biological tissues is much weaker than what is observed in normal bioluminescence and also different than thermal radiation emitted by tissues at their respective normal temperatures .",
    "there are two forms : a spontaneous one which occurs continuously and light emission following an initial optical excitation , often referred to as `` delayed luminescence '' ( dl ) which typically does not follow an exponential decay law .",
    "n this connection , we mention in passing that detailed studies of the associated ( poisson & sub - poisson ) statistics that arise from non - linear rate equations giving rise to them have also been made @xcite .    in sec.([pef ] ) , we discuss the biological cell and the nucleus within as cavities for resonating electromagnetic fields with the aim of investigation the idea that biophotons might initially reside in these cavities . also , the frequencies and the magnitude of the mean electric fields are estimated . in sec.([discussion ] ) , we discuss theoretical reasons for deviations from a linear rate equation and the resulting exponential decay law for fluorescence , which does not fit well with measured dl intensity as a function of time . in sec.([dynamics ] ) , motivated by the logistic equation , we discuss non - linear rate equations and the dynamics generating them for photon emission by nonliving systems and make a connection to growth rates for size and mass of cells _ etc . _ in sec.([gbm ] ) , the growth of a biological mass is analyzed and in sec.([pccg ] ) connected to biophoton intensity and its correlation with the cancer cell growth is presented via some experimental results . in sec.([ld ] ) , hyperbolic decays are considered and again a connection with cancer is noted .",
    "we close the paper with some concluding remarks in sec.([con ] ) .",
    "weak emission of biophotons ( also known as ultraweak bioluminescence ) from living cells and tissues of plant and animal origin is by now very well established @xcite and occur not only in the ultraviolet , but also the visible region of the spectrum , but it s precise physical origins remain unclear and are the subject of ongoing investigation .",
    "there is an enormous literature , but recent reviews can be found in the monographs @xcite . with no obvious excited molecules or atoms having been identified as being their sources , we estimate some of the characteristic frequencies one expects for natural biological cavity resonators .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the length scale of a cavity containing a fundamental frequency @xmath1 and a dielectric constant @xmath2 .",
    "these are related by @xmath3 for a typical biological cell and nucleus we have , respectively , that @xmath4 it is thereby expected that @xmath5 it is interesting to note here the size of the electric fields associated with one photon , @xmath6 a cavity photon located in the cell and nucleus , respectively , have associated electric fields @xmath7 while the photon frequencies of the biological cavity modes in the cell and in the nucleus are in agreement with experiments , the estimates of the electric fields here presented are lower than previously reported @xcite .",
    "it is often thought that the luminescence following an initial excitation should be exponential , but this invariably comes from some circular reasoning : either `` this is well - known to be the case '' or `` this is what one would expect from @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the excited population '' .",
    "deviations from exponential decay are actually quite well - known @xcite , though relatively absent from most textbooks .",
    "notable exceptions are the books by ballantine @xcite and merzbacher @xcite . to quote from merzbacher ( _ op .",
    "_ p513 ) , `` ... the fact remains that the exponential decay law , for which we have so much empirical support in radioactive decay processes , is not a rigorous consequence of quantum mechanics but the result of somewhat delicate approximations '' . among those approximations",
    "is that the initial state be coupled to a large number of final states with similar energies . for a treatment of systems decaying into small numbers of final states and the attendant failure of the exponential `` law '' ,",
    "see , for example @xcite . also of interest",
    "is @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are many simple physical systems which instead display hyperbolic decay laws .",
    "typical examples are those which involve the excitation of pairs in the medium , which then recombine to emit light .",
    "this naturally gives decay laws which one would expect classically to obey @xmath10 .",
    "note that this is a purely classical result and does not require coherent effects between the excited states , which would also be expected to give the same decay law . for a review of condensed matter analogs of hyperbolic delayed luminescence ( dl ) in living things ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in systems like cds , the hyperbolic delayed luminescence depends strongly on the size of the grains , and in the nematic liquid crystal 4-methoxybenzylidene-49-n - butylaniline ( mbba ) it is present in the crystalline form , but disappears on melting @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the character of delayed luminescence is not simply a matter of chemical composition , but can depend strongly on the form the material takes .",
    "interestingly , the trend seems to be towards higher dl in systems exhibiting higher degrees of structure , a fact which seems relevant for biological systems .",
    "approximately hyperbolic decay laws also arise in correlated many - soliton states @xcite which , again , may be relevant for biological systems .    it should be noted on general grounds , strict exponential decay is impossible in quantum mechanics .",
    "khalfin showed @xcite as far back as 1958 that the paley - wiener theorem , together with analyticity , forbids exponential decay at large times .",
    "there is also a simple physical argument .",
    "going to the energy representation from the time representation one finds ( _ i.e. _ taking a fourier transform of the amplitude , which would be proportional to @xmath11 ) a lorentzian which immediately gives two problems : the tail goes to infinity , so that a system with an initially finite energy could be found to have arbitrarily large energy .",
    "indeed , the lorentzian ( squared ) does not have a finite integral , so is unacceptable as a probability distribution for energy on physical grounds .",
    "there is a theorem @xcite that if @xmath12 is the probability that a system with a finite mean energy remains excited  that is , the survival probability  must satisfy @xmath13 at @xmath14 , a property shared by neither the exponential nor hyperbolic decays , so they must at best be approximations where they do seem to work .",
    "this can also be seen directly from the textbook `` derivation '' of exponential decay before any approximations are made .",
    "thus we see that a strictly exponential decay law fails at both large and short times .    for the hyperbolic decay law ,",
    "the same normalization problem in the energy representation is clearly present : the integral of @xmath15 from zero to infinity is infinite and , again , we find that a strictly hyperbolic decay law is unphysical , so nonlinear rate equations of this type must be approximations .",
    "weron and weron @xcite have argued for a survival probability in general ( for the cases where one might otherwise derive , with approximations , an exponential decay ) of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is even possible to have oscillations in decay @xcite .    since one in general expects deviations from either exponential or hyperbolic decays , any and all experimental data are welcome  the form of a decay law can , and indeed must , be more complicated than a simple exponential or hyperbolic decay law , however well those models may fit data over a restricted time interval .    in the following sections we shall discuss some non - linear rate equations that have been successfully employed for diverse biological systems .",
    "here we shall discuss some simple non - linear rate equations and the dynamical reasons behind them .",
    "the linear rate equation where the rate is proportional to the number itself leads of course to an exponential growth or an exponential decay .",
    "but as in all practical systems , some non - linearity is bound to be present giving rise to a non exponential in time behavior .",
    "the best studied example is that of the laser . here , if the mean photon number rate equation were linear , the number of laser photons would increase exponentially . of course",
    ", that can not be otherwise or we would need an infinite source of energy , hence there must be some dynamical mechanism to saturate the number .",
    "the solution to this problem was first given by willis e. lamb .",
    "the famous lamb equation for light intensity @xmath19 @xcite may be written as    @xmath20 i(t).\\ ] ]    the second term on the right hand side of eq.([d1 ] ) arises dynamically through the creation and annihilation of two - photons at a time , just as the first term is related to the creation and annihilation of single photons .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is called the pump parameter and its sign is crucial in determining the steady state value of @xmath22 .    if @xmath23 , the steady state value of @xmath22 ( determined by the vanishing of the left side of eq.([d1 ] ) ) is @xmath24 .",
    "physically , for negative pump parameters there is no laser activity . on the other hand",
    "though , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and hence the laser intensity increases linearly with @xmath21 .",
    "also , the innocent looking eq.([d1 ] ) has buried in it a ( second order ) phase transition wherein @xmath21 acts as the order parameter .",
    "this is easily seen by considering @xmath27 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath27 is continuous at @xmath28 but its derivative is not .    a simple model for a plethora of physical processes such as mean photon number , intensity , mass growth , magnetization _ etc . _ is provided by analogs of the eq.([d1 ] ) where the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath21 have different physical significance and their signs do play a crucial role in determining the fate of that physical system .",
    "as discussed previously in sec.([pef ] ) , the frequency of a mode in a biological cell is inversely proportional to the length in accordance with eq.([pef1 ] ) .",
    "if the cell geometry fluctuates via the length scale @xmath0 , then the frequency of the photon oscillator will be modulated .",
    "because of such a modulation , the cell cavity will emit or absorb two photons at a time ( as in the dynamical casimir effect ) thus leading to the above rate equation .",
    "similar ( non - linear ) rate equations must exist for any living system ( such as for its size , cell number _ etc .",
    "_ ) where their initial growth may be rapid but eventually cease , resulting in a limiting value ( such as the maximum size ) .",

    "the biophoton emission intensity from the cancer cells as a function of time has also been measured @xcite .",
