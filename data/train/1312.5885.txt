    "the fact that the most successful phenomenological theory , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , suffers from the inability to address several observed phenomena as well as theoretical questions , has always been a source of excitement for particle physicists .",
    "the tiny but non - zero neutrino masses that have been confirmed by the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations detected in solar , atmospheric and reactor experiments @xcite is certainly one such phenomena which the sm fails to address .",
    "these observations , among others have intensified the urge to ponder beyond the sm which has led to several well motivated beyond sm frameworks . the canonical seesaw mechanism ( commonly referred to as type - i seesaw @xcite ) , being the most elegant mechanism for generating small neutrino masses relies on the existence of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos .",
    "fundamentally speaking , the rh neutrinos are singlets under the sm gauge symmetry and hence can have arbitrary ( can be very large ) majorana masses leading to light neutrino masses as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dirac yukawa coupling , @xmath9 gev is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm higgs and @xmath10 is the rh majorana neutrino mass . in order to be compatible with the neutrino oscillation data , i.e , @xmath11 ev",
    ", one requires @xmath12 gev taking the yukawa couplings in their natural values i.e , @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the canonical seesaw , other seesaw mechanisms have been worked upon as well to explain the tiny masses of the active neutrinos . picking the type - ii seesaw mechanism @xcite from them which requires the existence of @xmath14 triplet higgs fields in addition to the minimal sm particle content , the neutrino mass gets an extra contribution given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the vev of the neutral component of the triplet and @xmath17 is the corresponding yukawa coupling . minimizing the scalar potential of such a model , the vev of the higgs triplet",
    "is found to be @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass of the higgs triplet and @xmath20 defines the mixing between sm higgs and triplet .",
    "an obvious setting would be @xmath21 and @xmath22 gev in order to explain sub - ev scale of light neutrino masses .",
    "although these seesaw mechanisms look promising while explaining neutrino oscillation data , they lack the direct experimental testability in the ongoing experiments like large hadron collider ( lhc ) or any future experiment like international linear collider .    retreating not here ,",
    "the particle phenomenology community has explored beyond standard model physics operative at few tev scale , the results being repetitive attempts to corroborate neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "one such highly motivated and one of the most widely discussed beyond standard model framework is the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite which not only gives a clear description of the origin of parity violation at electroweak scale but also leads a way to the generation of neutrino masses naturally .",
    "a thorough study of these models strengthens us with the knowledge that in conventional left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) , the light neutrino masses arise from two sources : the type - i @xcite plus type - ii @xcite seesaw mechanisms where the parity and @xmath2 gauge symmetry are spontaneously broken at the same scale .",
    "earlier explorations of the field imply that a deep relation between high energy collider physics and low energy phenomena like neutrino - less double beta decay as well as other lepton flavor violating processes is enrooted by minimal left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) valid at tev scale @xcite .",
    "if it happens that the parity and @xmath2 break at the same scale , then according to the seesaw relation @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 being a dimensionless parameter ) the microscopic value of @xmath16 as required for type - ii seesaw depends on large value of @xmath25 , which further implies @xmath26 gev making itself incapable of direct detection in near future . in a contrast way ,",
    "if the right - handed scale is assigned with more moderate values , say in the range of few tev , one can expect to have observable consequences at experiments in the near future .",
    "more willingly , if we assume both parity and @xmath2 to be broken at tev scale i.e , @xmath27 tev that is the scale of rh heavy neutrino mass , then we strictly need to calibrate the higgs couplings up to the order of @xmath28 in order to fit neutrino data from the seesaw relation . to refine this ,",
    "studies have been done on left - right symmetric models to come upon with spontaneous d - parity breaking @xcite where parity gets broken much earlier than @xmath2 gauge symmetry . in this work",
    ", we shall be discussing such a class of left - right symmetric models in which the spontaneous breaking of d - parity occurs at reasonably high scale along with @xmath29 gauge symmetry breaking down to @xmath30 .",
    "we then check numerically whether @xmath30 breaking occurs at tev scale ( provided parity breaks at much higher scale ) and tiny neutrino masses can be obtained without too much fine tuning . in this class of models ,",
    "the tev scale breaking of @xmath30 results in the tev scale masses of the right - handed neutrinos as well as @xmath31 boson while d - parity breaks at a high energy scale ( @xmath32 gev ) . as will be discussed later ,",
    "this allows the possibility of dominant type i seesaw contribution to neutrino mass whereas type ii seesaw contribution can naturally remain sub - dominant .",
    "we use such a sub - dominant type ii seesaw contribution as the origin of non - zero @xmath0 , the reactor mixing angle .",
    "it should be noted that , most of the earlier attempts to explain the non - zero @xmath0 incorporate different corrections to the @xmath33 symmetric tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) neutrino mass matrix which can naturally originate in generic flavor symmetry models like @xmath34 .",
    "motivated by this , we consider the dominant type i seesaw contribution giving rise to tbm type neutrino mass matrix whereas the sub - dominant type ii term giving rise to non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "we also constrain the d - parity breaking scale from the demand of generating the experimentally allowed range of @xmath0 . apart from this",
    ", we also investigate whether such a choice of intermediate symmetry breaking scales allows the possibility to unify all the gauge couplings while being embedded in a non - supersymmetric @xmath5 grand unified theory .",
    "with all these motivations , we present a @xmath5 model with a novel chain of symmetry breaking having left - right symmetry as an intermediate step giving neutrino masses through type - i plus type - ii seesaw mechanisms , unification of three fundamental forces , prediction of proton life time accessible to the ongoing search experiments and most importantly , a low mass @xmath1 gauge boson which can be probed at lhc .",
    "while preparing this manuscript , an interesting work appeared online @xcite with similar symmetry breaking chains and scales as the one we are discussing here .",
    "however , the neutrino mass phenomenology in that work is completely different from the one we pursue here .",
    "the plan of the paper can be sketched as follows . in section [ lrsmreview ]",
    "we briefly discuss the left - right symmetric models , elucidating the spontaneous breaking of d - parity . in section [ numass ]",
    "we discuss neutrino masses and mixing via dominant type - i seesaw giving rise to tbm type neutrino mixing and sub - dominate type - ii seesaw giving rise to deviations from tbm mixing and hence non - zero @xmath0 . in sections",
    "[ embedso10 ] and [ unifso10 ] , we give a possible path for embedding the present left - right symmetric models in the non - susy @xmath5 gut with its symmetry breaking pattern and one - loop gauge coupling unification . in section [ pdecay ] , the proton lifetime is estimated using the value gauge coupling at gut scale . in section [ lfv ] , we estimate the branching ratio for lepton flavor violating decay @xmath35 as a function of type ii seesaw strength and finally conclude in section [ conclude ] .",
    "in left - right symmetric models with spontaneous d - parity breaking , the discrete symmetry called d - parity gets broken earlier compared to the @xmath2 gauge symmetry . here",
    "the gauge group can be written effectively as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the discrete left - right symmetry or d - parity . in matter sector , the left and right handed fermions are doublets under @xmath14 and @xmath2 gauge groups , respectively .",
    "the transformation of quarks and leptons under the left - right symmetric group can be summarized as @xmath38 & , & q_{r}=\\begin{pmatrix}u_{r}\\\\ d_{r}\\end{pmatrix}\\equiv[1,2,{\\frac{1}{3}},3]\\,,\\nonumber \\\\",

    "the higgs sector of the left - right model with spontaneous d - parity breaking mechanism consists of a @xmath40 singlet scalar field @xmath41 which is odd under discrete d - parity , two @xmath14 triplets @xmath42 and a bidoublet @xmath43 which contains two copies of @xmath44 higgs transforming under the lr gauge group @xmath45 as @xmath46    by assigning a non - zero vev to d - parity odd singlet @xmath47 , the left - right symmetry is spontaneously broken but the gauge symmetry @xmath48 remains unbroken resulting in @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass term for triplets i.e , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the trilinear coupling in the term @xmath53 . in this scenario",

    "we can take the example of two loop analysis having higgs spectrum as presented in table.vii along with color octet higgs scalar ( 1,1,0,8 ) where the predicted mass scales are @xmath83 but the findings for one - loop analysis are @xmath84 hence , there will be little modification to the type ii seesaw contribution which is @xmath85 if one incudes two - loop rg effect .",
