    "the self - interaction corrected local spin density ( sic - lsd ) approximation @xcite has proved to be a useful scheme to describe static correlations in strongly correlated electron systems . in particular , it can determine whether an electron is delocalized or localized , i.e. , whether its orbital is part of the valence states or not .",
    "this leads to a determination of the number of valence states and a nominal valence , as demonstrated by numerous calculations on rare earths , actinides , transition metal oxides , including the parent compounds of the high t@xmath2 materials and the cmr materials .",
    "@xcite    the full sic - lsd scheme is unfortunately difficult to implement.@xcite this is due to the repeated transformations from reciprocal space ( k - space ) to real space to evaluate the self - interaction potential and the back transformations to k - space to solve the band structure problem .",
    "so far most applications of the full sic - lsd formalism have been implemented in the lmto - asa ( linearized muffin - tin orbitals ) band structure method.@xcite in this paper a simpler but more versatile scheme is developed and implemented within multiple scattering theory , in the korringa , kohn , rostocker ( kkr ) formulation .",
    "its main advantage , thanks to a straightforward determination of the green s function , is a possible generalization to alloys via the coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite since a single - site approximation underpins this new formulation , in what follows it is referred to as a local self - interaction correction ( lsic ) formalism .",
    "it is based on the experience with the full sic - lsd implementation showing that to better than 98% the electron is localized on the site under consideration , which justifies the single - site approximation .",
    "whilst in the full lmto - asa implementation , the representation of the localized orbitals over a real - space cluster determines the extent of these orbitals , in the present scheme the degree of localization is determined by the energy dependence of the single - site phase shift , in particular the width of its resonance , corresponding to the localized electron .",
    "a broader resonance would imply reduced localization .",
    "the sic - lsd formalism for solids has been developed into a scheme that treats both localized and delocalized electrons on equal footing .",
    "the decision whether an electron should be considered as localized or delocalized is based on a delicate balance between the energy gain due to the inclusion of the self - interaction correction ( localization ) energy and the energy loss in band or hybridization energy.@xcite while this methodology has been successful in differentiating localized from delocalized electrons , i.e. , a dual character of the electron , it does not describe the interesting crossover between localized and delocalized states which occurs for example in heavy fermion systems .",
    "our aim here is to develop a theory which describes local fluctuations of the electronic configurations between that where an electron can be said to be localized and another where an electron is delocalized .",
    "it will be shown that the present local formulation of sic - lsd readily lends itself to be the basic idea of such a development .",
    "the origin of our approach goes back to the invention and use of the coherent potential approximation to describe the charge and spin fluctuations about the hartree - fock solution of the hubbard model by hubbard himself ( hubbard iii approximation).@xcite the present implementation of this idea rests on its generalization to account for the corresponding fluctuations about the local density approximation ( lda ) to the first - principles density functional theory ( dft).@xcite in the literature this generalization , when applied to spin fluctuations , is referred to as the kkr - cpa implementation of the disordered local moment ( dlm ) picture.@xcite indeed , the present work can be considered as the further elaboration of this basic idea in which the lsic replaces the lda as the local description of the electronic structure and the attention is being focused on the valance fluctuations .",
    "interestingly , it is now well established that hubbard s so - called `` alloy analogy '' approximation , which prompted the use of the cpa , leaves out of consideration some very important fluctuations .",
    "the most significant of these are those which give rise to a kondo - like resonance at the fermi energy in the case of the hubbard model and correspond to such a qualitatively new physics as the mott transition .",
    "the relevance of this in the present context is that such fluctuations are well described by the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite whose static limit , for the hubbard model , is precisely the `` alloy analogy '' cpa of hubbard.@xcite this point was particularly clearly explained in the recent paper of kakahashi.@xcite consequently , it is reasonable to regard our lsic based kkr - cpa - dlm calculations as investigations of the static limit of a yet undeveloped first principles dmft . in what follows when we refer to the need to include dynamical effects in the theory it is the above theoretical considerations we will have in mind .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we concentrate on the phase shifts and single - site green s function from which the sic charge and potential , corresponding to localized electron states , are calculated within the kkr method .",
    "since the latter can be easily extended to include coherent potential approximation , section [ sec : cpa ] briefly summarizes its most important equations in terms of the multiple scattering quantities . in section [ sec",
    ": ft ] the formalism is extended to finite temperatures .",
    "the potential and versatility of the lsic method is demonstrated on the application to the @xmath3 phase transition in ce . in section [ sec : ce ] we first discuss the f - phase shifts , total energies , lattice parameters , densities of states ( dos ) , and spectral functions at t=0k for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 phases , as obtained from the lsic - kkr method . wherever appropriate we compare with the results of the full sic - lsd implementations within lmto - asa.@xcite in this section we also present calculations for finite temperatures and the full phase diagram of the @xmath3 phase transition .",
    "both the cpa and dlm are utilized to accomplish the latter , and to illustrate how the present approach is capable to describe both spin and valence fluctuations at finite temperatures .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to various aspects of the present approach and among them a consideration of how intermediate valence could be realized within the present implementation , which motivates a possible generalization to include dynamics , as outlined in section [ sec : outlook ] .",
    "the paper is summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the present formulation of sic , we adopt the physical picture of multiple - scattering theory , where a solid is represented by an array of non - overlapping scattering centers . the electronic motion",
    "is then broken down into a sequence of scattering events and a free propagation in between .",
    "the most useful concept of this method is a phase shift , describing scattering of electrons from ions , the scattering centers in a solid .",
    "if a phase shift is resonant it is reminiscent of a bound state at positive energies , i.e. , above the zero of the potential which in our case is the muffin - tin zero .",
    "the energy derivative of the phase shift is related to the wigner delay - time .",
    "if this is large the electron will spend a long time on the site .",
    "such slow electrons will be much more affected by the spurious self - interaction and therefore should see a si - corrected potential .    in most systems , where the electrons are truly delocalized , the self - interaction contribution to the potential is negligible and",
    "therefore the lda is an excellent approximation .",
    "when the phase shift has a resonance one has to calculate the self - interaction correction for this @xmath6 angular momentum channel .",
    "this is accomplished by calculating the one - electron charge density for this channel , defining the charge density for the self - interaction correction . from this one",
    "can readily calculate the self - interaction potential which has to be added to the lsd potential , and then the new phase shifts are calculated for the total ( sic - lsd ) potential .",
    "this has to be carried out @xmath7 channel by @xmath7 channel for a given angular momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the minimum of the total energy will determine the optimum configuration of ( @xmath8,@xmath7 ) channels to be self - interaction corrected .",
    "therefore to each of the @xmath7 channels one can assign two potential functions , v@xmath9(r ) and v@xmath10(r ) .",
    "the formalism determining the energy functional associated with the potential v@xmath9(r ) is briefly outlined in the next section .",
    "it should be mentioned here that if the total energies corresponding to these two different potentials are sufficiently close , one can envisage dynamical effects to play an important role as a consequence of possible tunneling between these states .",
    "we shall return to this point in the later sections .",
    "it has been pointed out by perdew and zunger@xcite that density functional theory ( dft ) schemes , like the local spin density approximation , suffer from a spurious self - interaction of the electrons with themselves . in principle , this self - interaction term should vanish exactly , as it does in the hartree - fock theory . in practice , however , this cancellation is incomplete .",
    "perdew and zunger suggested an approximate solution to this problem , which was constructed for finite systems but is here extended to solids in a different way as compared to previous implementations for solids.@xcite    the usual representation of the total energy within the lsd - dft formalism in the kohn - sham approach@xcite is @xmath11 & = & \\sum_{\\alpha\\sigma}^{\\rm occ } \\langle    \\phi_{\\alpha\\sigma}|-\\nabla^2|\\phi_{\\alpha\\sigma } \\rangle + e_{\\rm ext } \\nonumber \\\\   & & +   e_{\\rm h}[n]+e_{\\rm xc}^{\\rm lsd}[n_{\\uparrow},n_{\\downarrow } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 s are the kohn - sham orbitals , ( @xmath13 is a combined index labeling the orbital and spin ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , respectively ) , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",

    "the approach by perdew and zunger has to be generalized .",
    "this involves simultaneously a wannier representation of the orbitals , necessary to determine @xmath29 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sic - pot ] ) , and a bloch representation to solve the band structure problem .",
    "furthermore , the wannier functions are required to fulfill the localization criterion which ensures that the energy functional is stationary with respect to unitarian mixing among the orbitals .",
    "this localization criterion is necessary , because the sic is not invariant under unitary transformations of the occupied orbitals .",
    "this is in contrast with the lsd where a unitary transformation of the occupied orbitals leaves the lsd potential invariant , since the total charge density remains unaltered . for the orbital dependent sic potential v@xmath30 such a unitary transformation will change v@xmath30 .",
    "the localization criterion @xmath31 determines the unitary transformation which ensures the global minimum of the total energy and the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "solutions of this equation usually take the form of the eigenvector @xmath32 having weight in one channel only @xmath33 which would be different from the channel where the weight of the eigenvector @xmath34 @xmath35 is concentrated , i.e. , @xmath36 is not equal to @xmath37 .",
    "this generalization forms the basis of the sic implementations@xcite which start from a band - picture scenario .",
    "as already mentioned , the proposed generalization of the perdew and zunger idea is based on the notion of resonances in scattering theory , which are the reminiscence of atomic states in the solid .",
    "core states are represented by bound states at negative energies , where the imaginary part of the generalized complex phase shift jumps abruptly by @xmath38 .",
    "localized valence states still have very sharp resonances but band - like states are characterized by slowly varying phase shifts .    the central quantity of ( scalar - relativistic ) multiple scattering theory is the single - particle green s function@xcite @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a vector inside the cell at @xmath42",
    ", @xmath43 denotes the combined index for the decomposition into symmetrized lattice harmonics @xmath44 and @xmath45(@xmath46 ) is the vector smaller ( larger ) in magnitude from the pair ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the building blocks of the green s function are the regular and irregular solutions of the radial schrdinger equation at a given ( complex ) energy @xmath48 @xmath49 the scattering - path matrix @xmath50 ( in @xmath51 and @xmath52 representation ) @xmath53^{-1}\\ ] ] is related to the structural green s function @xmath54 , describing the free propagation between the scattering centers , and the @xmath55 matrix defines the single site scattering .",
    "the total valence charge density per spin @xmath52 is given by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the bottom of the valence band and the fermi energy , respectively .",
    "in standard lsd calculations , the new effective potential for the next iteration of the self - consistency cycle is calculated from this density ( now including the core contributions ) as @xmath59({{\\bf r } } ) + v^{\\rm lsd}_{\\rm{xc } , \\sigma}[n_{\\uparrow},n_{\\downarrow}]({{\\bf r}}).\\ ] ] in order to remove the spurious self - interaction , still present in this potential , we consider the problem of electrons moving in an array of scatterers .",
    "as already mentioned , an electron which shows localized behavior has a sharp resonance in its phase shift , associated with a large wigner - delay time on a particular site . to determine the sic charge we will consider for a moment the atomic limit , i.e. , the situation where the scatterers are far apart . in this case",
    "the single site @xmath60-matrix and the local multiple scattering @xmath61-matrix coincide , and all occupied states correspond to bound states . in this limit",
    "each bound state contributes exactly the charge of one electron , and this charge can be calculated by integrating the diagonal of the spectral function just around the energy of the bound state . in order to be able to decompose the charge density ( eq .  ( [ eq : density - g ] ) ) into different angular momentum channels , we choose symmetry adapted spherical harmonics .",
    "these are defined by applying a unitary transformation to the ordinary real ( or complex ) spherical harmonics , such that the on - site scattering matrix becomes diagonal , @xmath62 it is easy to verify that the required transformation matrix @xmath63 is , in fact , independent of the energy @xmath48 .",
    "this transformation to symmetry adapted spherical harmonics also ensures that the degeneracy of states , which are localized , is conserved .",
    "we will demonstrate this later by si - correcting the triplet states ( one by one ) of the ce @xmath64-manifold . in this symmetrized representation ,",
    "the green s function , which in the atomic limit equals the atomic green s function , becomes diagonal with respect to this quantum number .",
    "hence we can decompose the spin resolved charge density into its @xmath65 components and define the charge of a state , characterized by its principle quantum number @xmath66 , angular momentum @xmath65 and spin @xmath52 : @xmath67 where the energies @xmath68 and @xmath69 lie slightly below and above the energy of the state @xmath70 . within the multiple scattering formulation , in the atomic limit",
    ", this charge density can be written as @xmath71 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the site index , since in this case the single site @xmath60-matrix and the @xmath61-matrix are obviously identical .",
    "this , of course , is not the case for a solid with finite lattice spacings .",
    "when considering resonances in a solid it is not a priori clear whether to use the @xmath60- or @xmath61-matrix for calculating the charge density in question .",
    "the main difference between using the @xmath60- matrix or @xmath61-matrix is that the latter does include a small hybridization of the localized state with the surrounding atoms , while the former does not .",
    "also the choice of the lower and upper integration limits is not clearly defined .",
    "we will now give a short discussion of the possible modes for calculating the sic charge of a resonant state .",
    "the lower integration limit is most reasonably chosen to be the bottom of the energy contour @xmath72 . however , care has to be taken that this contour always encloses the si - corrected states .",
    "nota bene , in the case of ce , discussed in the following sections , the contour also includes the @xmath73 semi - core states .",
    "the upper integration limit could be either chosen such that the sic charge density integrates to exactly one electron , or simply set to the fermi energy @xmath74 . using the @xmath60-matrix",
    ", we find that we have to integrate up to an @xmath75 , which is slightly above the fermi level in order to capture one electron .",
    "the @xmath61-matrix , on the other hand , due to hybridization , yields a charge of one for energies slightly below the fermi energy . unfortunately",
    ", when dealing with the @xmath61-matrix , it is computationally very expensive to assume @xmath69 different from the fermi energy .",
    "however , the excess charge due to integrating up to the fermi level is only of the order of a hundredth of an electron .",
    "( the missing charge in case of integrating the @xmath60-matrix up to the fermi level is of similar magnitude . ) in the following we used the @xmath61-matrix integrated up to @xmath76 to determine the sic charge . some tests with the @xmath60-matrix , and the requirement of a sic - charge of unity , resulted in an upward shift of the total energies by about 1 mry .",
    "the charge density , calculated in either of the proposed ways , is used to construct the effective self - interaction free potential , namely @xmath77({{\\bf r } } ) - v_{\\rm xc}^{\\rm lsd}[n_{il\\sigma}^{\\rm sic},0]({{\\bf r } } ) .\\ ] ] in this paper we only consider the spherically symmetric part of the sic density and sic potential .",
    "hence , the @xmath60-matrix is diagonal in @xmath8 and @xmath7 . here",
    "it should be noted that , if we transform the equations back to the unsymmetrized ( real or complex ) spherical harmonics , this effective potential assumes matrix character with respect to the angular momentum , and would not simply couple to the density , but rather to the non - diagonal @xmath78 density matrix .",
    "this is conceptually analogous to the rotationally invariant formulation of lda+u by dudarev _",
    "et al._@xcite    for each self - interaction corrected channel @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we replace the @xmath81 element of the original @xmath60-matrix by the one obtained from the si - corrected potential @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the @xmath60-matrix calculated from the effective potential @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is calculated from the si - corrected potential @xmath86 .",
    "this @xmath87-matrix is then used in eq .",
    "( [ tau - mat ] ) to calculate the new , si - corrected , scattering path matrix @xmath88 . from the latter the new sic - lsd charge density is calculated , and the process is iterated until self - consistency is reached .",
    "the correction term , which approximately compensates the self - repulsion , is an attractive potential which will pull down in energy the state to which it is applied ( see section [ sec : ce ] ) .",
    "to finish this section we would like to mention that in contrast to the lsd , the sic - lsd hamiltonian is not invariant under unitary transformations of the occupied orbitals .",
    "as pointed out before , in the full implementation the localization criterion is applied to make the solution stationary under this unitary mixing of states . in the present implementation",
    "there is no such localization criterion , and one has to be solely guided by the energetics to find the global energy minimum .",
    "note that the total energies are invariant under a rotation of the coordinate system owing to the symmetry adapted spherical harmonics that diagonalize the @xmath61-matrix at the @xmath89 point .",
    "hence , the energies of the configurations where , one by one , each state out of a degenerate manifold is localized are the same .",
    "this was tested on ce by si - correcting all @xmath64-states separately .",
    "as expected , the energies for localizing any of the @xmath90 ( or respectively the @xmath91 ) states were identical .",
    "one of the advantages of the multiple scattering implementation of the sic - lsd formalism is that it can be easily generalized to include the coherent potential approximation , @xcite extending the range of applications to random alloys .",
    "in addition , one can use it to treat static correlations beyond lsd by studying pseudoalloys whose constituents are composed e.g. of two different states of a given system : one delocalized , described by the lsd potential , and another localized , corresponding to the sic - lsd potential . combined with the dlm formalism for spin - fluctuations,@xcite",
    "this allows also for different orientations of the local moments of the constituents involved .    in the cpa extension of the sic - lsd formalism ,",
    "bearing in mind its single - site aspect , it is required to satisfy the following cpa self - consistency condition    @xmath92    where the impurity @xmath93matrices @xmath94 and @xmath95 are given by    @xmath96    and the @xmath93matrix of the coherent potential approximation    @xmath97    here @xmath98 is the volume of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the respective single site scattering matrices of the @xmath101 and @xmath102 species , occurring with the concentrations @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , and @xmath105 is the @xmath106matrix of the effective cpa medium . note that in the cpa extension of the sic - lsd formalism , the cpa condition ( eq .  ( [ eq : tau_cpa ] ) ) is an additional self - consistency criterion to the usual charge or potential self - consistency .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the formalism of this section can be easily generalized from a binary to a multi - component case , as described in ref .  .",
    "in addition , an extention of the lsic - cpa formalism to finite temperatures can be implemented as described in the next section ( [ sec : ft ] ) .",
    "in this section we summarize the relevant formulas underlying the finite temperature generalization of the present formalism in its cpa extention .",
    "in contrast to @xmath107 , at finite temperatures the physics is dominated by thermal ( classical ) fluctuations .",
    "therefore , to properly take into account the finite temperature effects , one needs to evaluate the free energy of the system ( alloy ) under consideration , namely    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the electronic ( particle - hole ) entropy , @xmath110 the mixing entropy , @xmath111 the magnetic entropy , and @xmath112 the entropy originating from the lattice vibrations .",
    "the electron - hole entropy is defined as@xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the usual boltzmann constant and @xmath115 denotes the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the entropy of mixing in the case of a binary system can be expressed as @xmath116 the magnetic and vibrational entropies are strongly dependent on the system under consideration , and they will be discussed in more detail in the section dedicated to the phase diagram of ce .    finally , note that in the definition of the free energy , the finite temperature enters only via the fermi - dirac distribution and the entropy contributions , while for the exchange - correlation energy , being part of the total energy e@xmath117 , the t=0k lda ( lsd ) approximation is used for all temperatures , which is a common practice in all _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "this section completes the formal description and implementation of the lsic - kkr - cpa band structure method . in the following sections we shall illustrate the potential and versatility of this approach for describing strongly correlated electron systems by an application to ce .",
    "there we present both the t=0k and finite temperature results , including the phase diagram of the famous @xmath118 phase transition .",
    "ce is the first element in the periodic table that contains an @xmath64 electron , and shows an interesting phase diagram.@xcite in particular , its isostructural ( fcc @xmath119 fcc ) @xmath3 phase transition is associated with a 15%-17% volume collapse and quenching of the magnetic moment.@xcite the low - pressure @xmath1-phase shows a local magnetic moment , and is associated with a trivalent configuration of ce . at the temperatures in which the @xmath1-phase is accessible , it is in a paramagnetic disordered local moment state . increasing the pressure ,",

    "above which there is a continuous crossover between the two phases .    in the following paragraphs",
    "we first discuss the sic and non - sic @xmath121 phase shifts and densities of states .",

    "it can be seen that the uncorrected @xmath64-states have a very sharp resonance just above the fermi energy .",
    "the steep resonance corresponds to a long wigner delay - time and indicates that the state is already well localized .",

    "it can be seen that by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : nl - sic ] ) up to the fermi energy , one collects slightly more than one electron .",
    "this is because there is a small density of states in the vicinity of the fermi level ( note the scale of the left - hand side axis in fig .",
    "[ sic - charge ] ) , which is due to slight hybridization of the sic channel with the other @xmath64-channels whose resonances occur in the vicinity of the fermi level ( see fig .  [",

    "next is the effect of the cpa . in the study by svane ,",
    "@xcite it was suggested that the weak departure from linearity of the total energy curves as a function of concentration ( fig .",
    "[ cpa - fig ] ) did not play an important role .",
    "thus , we recalculated the phase diagram , replacing the full concentration dependence of the total energy by the linear interpolation @xmath132 the effect of this approximation can be seen in table [ crit - points ] by comparing the columns ii and iii , respectively .",

    "is strikingly reduced , in comparison to the cpa calculation , and similar to the one reported by svane . as pointed out by johansson _",
    "et al._,@xcite the critical temperature is to a large extent determined by the mixing entropy . without the mixing entropy one would at all temperatures find a sudden transition ( with a finite volume collapse ) between the low and high pressure phases .",
    "the mixing entropy will , if the temperature is high enough , lead to a minimum of the free energy for an intermediate concentration of the @xmath1-phase , eventually resulting in a continuous crossover between the low - pressure and the high pressure phase . as seen in fig .",
    "[ cpa - fig ] , the cpa gives rise to a convex ( from above ) curvature of the total energies .",
    "it effectively reduces the mixing entropy and increases the critical temperature .",
    "it can also be seen that within this linear approximation , the difference between the dlm and the ferro calculations is strongly reduced , which means that the main effect of dlm is not only the energy lowering of the @xmath1-phase , but more importantly a different shape of the energy versus concentration curves .",
    "last , we discuss the effect of the degeneracy of the @xmath1-phase ground state . as described above , in the cf calculations a degeneracy of 8 was used , corresponding to almost degenerate @xmath133 and @xmath91 states , arising from a crystal field splitting .",
    "the results to be compared here are shown in the columns cf and so of table [ crit - points ] . in the so scenario ,",
    "the term proportional to @xmath134 , corresponding to a @xmath135 state , was used for the magnetic entropy , instead of @xmath136 , as in the cf scenario .",
    "one can see that the magnetic entropy , being linear in @xmath103 , determines mostly the slope of the phase separation line and has only a minor effect on the magnitude of the critical temperature .",
    "the results obtained with the dlm and the magnetic entropy due to the cf splitting show better agreement of the calculated transition pressures with experiment .",
    "this , however , may be due to a cancellation of errors . the slope of the phase separation line is mainly given by the ratio @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the the t=0 values of the entropy and the volume of the @xmath140-phase .    due to the larger underestimation of the volume of the @xmath0-phase , the volume collapse is slightly overestimated in our approach .",
    "therefore the higher value of the entropy difference in the cf scenario , as opposed to the so scenario , leads to a better agreement with the experimental slope .",
    "it should be noted though that these calculations do not include the vibrational entropy . to estimate the effect of this vibrational entropy",
    ", we recalculate the phase diagram using a simple model for the vibrational entropy , namely @xmath141 with the value of @xmath142 , as suggested by jeong _",
    "et al._@xcite in doing so , the critical temperature is only slightly reduced to 1292 k , while the critical pressure increases to 69 kbar . in view of the above discussion",
    ", it is not surprising that a contribution , which is purely linear in @xmath103 , basically affects only the critical pressure .",
    "we conclude from this result that this simplified model for the vibrational entropy is too crude and a more sophisticated one should be put in place .",
    "one should here add that johansson _",
    "et al._@xcite have employed a debye - grneisen model , while svane@xcite has completely neglected the vibrational entropy .",

    "as can be seen in the figure , the critical temperature quickly decreases with the increase of the admixture of trivalent ce in the @xmath0-phase . in this calculation",
    ", the sic - lsd energies have been uniformly calibrated to keep the zero temperature transition pressure at its original value of -7.4 kbar .",
    "it can be seen in the figure that the best value for critical temperature is obtained for @xmath145 , which corresponds to an intermediate valence of 3.6 .",
    "the intermediate valence scenario for the @xmath0-phase , as discussed above , could result from dynamical fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations could be realized by describing ce as a two level system ( tls ) .",
    "we will elaborate on this idea in section [ sec : outlook ] .",
    "a mechanism , based on the dynamical interaction of two states will , quite generally , be more effective if the two states are close in energy . looking at the total energy as a function of the lattice spacing and the concentration ( fig .  [ free - energy - plots ] ) , one finds that the pure @xmath0- and @xmath1-solutions ( lda and sic - lsd , respectively ) are degenerate close to @xmath146 atomic units .",
    "the interaction of these two states will lower the total energy at these lattice constants , and eventually might establish them as the global minimum . the increased lattice constant would be closer to experimental values .",
    "clearly such a state would be neither described by full localization nor delocalization of the @xmath64-electron , but would be better characterized as an intermediate valence state . in the following section",
    "we will outline how we envision this two - level system to work .",
    "the next point we want to discuss is the effect of lattice relaxations . in the intermediate valence regime ( as described by the static cpa ) there is a rather large size - mismatch between the @xmath0- and the @xmath1-atoms , which may give rise to strong internal strains .",
    "allowing for lattice relaxations , which are not considered here , would give rise to an energy lowering for intermediate concentrations and could lead to intermediate valence , even in the static limit , and hence to the reduction of the critical temperature .",
    "another factor that might have a significant influence on the phase diagram and its characteristics is associated with the single - site aspect of the cpa .",
    "being a single - site theory , the cpa can not deal with order in disorder , namely with short range order ( sro ) in the distribution of the alloy configurations .",
    "however , even in the disordered phase it must be important to distinguish situations where the nearest neighbours are preferentially like atoms from those where they are unlike atoms .",
    "such short range order is expected to lower the free energy of the disordered state and hence lower t@xmath2 of the @xmath3 phase transition .",
    "in addition , it should influence the energetically favourable relative concentration of the two different components of the alloy .",
    "thus by taking sro into account one might be able to move beyond the primitive alloy analogy and improve on the present lsic - kkr - cpa approach .",
    "the way it could be accomplished is by implementing the nonlocal extention of the kkr - cpa,@xcite which would allow to treat possible correlated valence fluctuations near the @xmath3 phase transition in ce .",
    "finally , the phase diagram of ce suggests that at negative pressure there could exist a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , i.e. , a localization - delocalization transition at zero temperature , driven by pressure .",
    "the vicinity of this qcp , although it is not accessible experimentally , could still influence the physics of the material in the accessible positive pressure range .",
    "the quantum fluctuations , which are responsible for the transition , should also be visible in its vicinity and could explain the correlated nature of the @xmath0- phase .",
    "several times in this article we have referred to the possibility of going beyond the theory outlined above by allowing for dynamical valence and spin fluctuations . in short ,",
    "the suggestion is that , as above , we regard the self - interaction corrected and the not so corrected version of the local potential at a site , as corresponding to two states of the atom and allow for such atom to tunnel between the two states @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which would form a two - level system .",
    "electrons interacting with such tls were already thoroughly studied in the context of metallic glasses.@xcite in the present scenario such a procedure would address the valence fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "identifying the possible spin states of the si - corrected system with the two levels would constitute a possible dynamical generalization of the dlm formalism , taking into account dynamical spin fluctuations .",
    "this might describe the kondo screening of the local moments at low temperatures .",
    "many of the consequences of such interactions are by now well known.@xcite in such studies the tls is an atom tunneling between two nearly degenerate positions in a metallic environment.@xcite the physics is particularly interesting in the case of assisted tunneling where the tls changes its state as an electron scatters from it .",
    "however , it should be stressed that in the cases where the atom changes its position in the tunneling process , the tls is external to the electron system whilst in the proposed model it is designed to capture the physics of a slowly changing collective degree of freedom of the electrons themselves . in this sense our tls is very much like the dlm in paramagnetic metals .    from the point of view of the present perspective",
    "the most directly relevant work on external tls s is that of vladar _",
    "et al._@xcite they show that , if the tls couples two or more angular momentum states , as the temperature is lowered the high temperature pseudoalloy phase gives way , at a characteristic temperature t@xmath149 to a ground state which is an orbital analogue of kondo singlets of magnetic impurities in metals . in the case of the lda / sic - lsd tls ,",
    "this means , that at high temperatures , we would find the pseudoalloy , as described above , while at low temperatures , the system would be neither in the lda , nor in the sic - lsd state , but would be in an intermediate valence ground state .",
    "clearly , such dynamical fluctuations may also help to reduce the critical temperature if the generalized kondo - temperature , associated with the tls , is not too small .    as a final remark concerning the dynamical generalization of our disordered local valence calculations we note that the above model is an analogue of yuval and anderson s kondo hamiltonian approach to the magnetic impurity problem , as opposed to the full dynamical calculation based on the anderson model , deployed for the same problem by hamann.@xcite the relevant point",
    "to stress is that these two calculations yield , in the appropriately asymptotic , namely scaling , regime the same results .",
    "thus , they lend credit to the above proposed short - cut to a first principles dmft treatment of our fluctuating valence problem .",
    "we have presented a new , multiple scattering , implementation of the sic - lsd formalism for solids within kkr band structure method , combined with the cpa description of intermediate valences .",
    "the method has been illustrated on the application to the ce @xmath3 phase transition .",
    "the results have been discussed in detail , highlighting the new functionality and potential of this approach owing to a better static description of spin and valence fluctuations .",
    "the importance of all the different aspects of the formalism has been analysed in detail .",
    "this new method is not to be looked at as an alternative to the earlier implementations within the lmto - asa band structure method .",
    "its great potential , and in some way superiority , arises from the local and multiple scattering aspects through which the method lends itself easily to various generalizations and extentions on the account of the straightforward determination of the one - electron green s function .",
    "of particular interest here is an inclusion of dynamical fluctuations , for which a roadmap has been briefly outlined in the previous section .",
    "the results of the present paper constitute the first crucial steps on this road towards dynamics .",
    "finally , there is one more aspect of the present results which warrants further comment . as we have reported in sec .",
    "[ subsec : analysis ] , in our dlm calculations local moment formed only when the local electronic structure was described by sic - lsd , whilst it iterated to zero when lda was used in recalculating the spin polarized crystal potential .",
    "this is precisely the behavior one would have expected on the basis of the numerous successes of sic in predicting moment formation , and no moment formation in applications to extended systems.@xcite clearly , the fact that our local implementation of sic , namely lsic , behaves in this way lends strong support to our contention that self - interaction correction formalism can be , and perhaps should be , applied at the local level .",
