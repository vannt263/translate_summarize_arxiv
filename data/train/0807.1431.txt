    ", a feedback is used to apply a voltage between the tip and the sample in order to minimize the electrostatic tip - sample interaction . for metals ,",
    "this voltage is equal to the contact potential difference ( cpd ) , _ i.e. _ the bias voltage to be applied between the tip and the surface to align their fermi levels .",
    "it is connected to the difference between the work functions of the two surfaces , and thereby to their local electronic properties , according to :    @xmath0    @xmath1 being the elementary electrical charge : @xmath2  c.    nowadays , two kpfm - based techniques provide facilities to map the spatial variations of the cpd on the nanometer scale , namely frequency-  @xcite or amplitude - modulation - kpfm  @xcite ( fm- or am - kpfm , respectively ) .",
    "these methods were primarily applied to metallic and semiconducting surfaces to study the distribution of dopants in semiconductors @xcite , or the adsorption of organic molecules ( for an overview see ref .",
    "[ ] ) . in a few experiments ,",
    "even molecular  @xcite or atomic  @xcite contrast has been reported .",
    "the extension of the technique to insulating surfaces , was performed more recently , as demonstrated by the results reported on thin ionic films on metals @xcite , or on the contribution of bulk defects to the surface charge state of ionic crystals @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "atomic corrugation of the cpd signal is reported for the first time on the ( 001 ) surface of a bulk ionic crystal of kbr .",
    "for that purpose , kpfm experiments were carried out in ultrahigh vacuum with a base pressure below @xmath3  mbar using a home built non - contact atomic force microscope operated at room temperature @xcite . a highly doped silicon cantilever with a resonance frequency @xmath4  khz , and a spring constant @xmath5  n.m@xmath6 was used .",
    "the typical oscillation amplitude of the fundamental bending resonance was @xmath7  nm . the cantilever was annealed ( 30  min  @  120@xmath8 ) and gently sputtered with ar@xmath9 ions ( 1 - 2  min  @  680  ev ) .",
    "the kbr crystal was cleaved in ultrahigh vacuum along the ( 001)-plane and subsequently annealed at 120@xmath8 during an hour .",
    "the kpfm signal was detected using the am mode , as described in detail in ref . . while these experiments , atomic - scale contrast was as well visible in the topography channel ( data not shown ) .",
    "the cpd measurements are reported in figs.[fig_exp]a and b. in fig.[fig_exp]a , the image exhibits atomic features , the measured period of which is 0.63  nm , which is visible in the joint cross section .",
    "this value matches to a good agreement the lattice constant of kbr , 0.66  nm .",
    "the vertical contrast yields about 100  mv around an average value of -3.9  v , the origin of which will be discussed in section [ sec_kpfm ] .",
    "a striking aspect of those results is the robustness of the imaging process in terms of stability and reproducibility upon the tips used .",
    "these results suggest an intrinsic imaging process relying on the microscopic origin of the contact potential arising at the sample surface . in this case",
    ", the cpd rather turns into _ local cpd _ , consistently with the concept of _ local work function _ which has been introduced by wandelt on metals@xcite . by",
    " intrinsic imaging process \" , it is meant that the contrast can be accounted for with a tip consisting of a single material , namely a metal .",
    "thus , the atomic contrast neither relies on adsorbed nor on unstable species at the tip apex , as often reported for topographic@xcite or dissipation@xcite imaging by nc - afm .",
    "a. b- corresponding cross section.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in this work , in order to understand the local cpd contrast formation , an electrostatic model is proposed that allows us to derive an expression of the short - range electrostatic force occurring between a biased metallic tip of a nc - afm microscope and the surface of a bulk dielectric . on the contrary to more refined numerical methods proposed in the literature for almost similar systems@xcite ,",
    "the analytical development is restricted to a simple tip geometry and a classical , continuous electrostatic approach .",
    "notwithstanding , the model allows us to define a general frame , able to put in relation the surface electrostatic properties with the imaging process yielding atomic contrast of the cpd on ionic surfaces .",
    "obviously , the main results presented here remain qualitatively correct for more complex tip geometries , although numerical methods are then required to get quantitative numbers .",
    "the motivations for that work are twofold . on the one hand , to our knowledge , a compact modelization of the short - range electrostatic forces responsible for the atomic contrast in kpfm on a bulk ionic crystal is still lacking . on the other hand , when evaluating kpfm experiments , the relative complexity of fm- or am - kpfm experimental setups , both including four electronic controllers , makes the interpretation of the experimental images , and primarily cpd images , tedious , especially when dealing with atomic resolution .",
    "several groups analyzed the kpfm imaging mechanism in order to evaluate their data in terms of quantitative values and lateral resolution@xcite , a few of them also compared am- and fm - kpfm in terms of evaluating the force and its gradient , respectively@xcite .",
    "the fact that many of the above mentioned calculations point out that kpfm results , especially for nano - objects , show a strong distance dependence , clearly points out that for a careful analysis , it is not sufficient to only calculate the electrostatic tip - sample interaction .",
    "it is rather important to perform simulations including all imaging mechanisms and in particular also the distance control in order to exclude artifacts due to the feedback circuits . in order to explore the origin of the cpd atomic contrast",
    ", we are aiming to closely mimic a real kpfm setup by means of an earlier developed nc - afm simulator@xcite . in the present case of an ionic surface",
    ", it is required to consider a large slab of ions , virtually infinite , to describe properly the electrostatic interaction .",
    "this is hardly feasible by means of _ ab initio _ calculations which fail to describe tip - surface systems involving a too big number of atoms .",
    "therefore , prior to simulating the cpd contrast on ionic surfaces by means of our simulator , which is the scope of a future work , we have to find an analytical expression for the electrostatic tip - sample interaction .",
    "the following section details the boundary - value electrostatic problem leading to the expression of the force ( section [ sec_force ] ) . in section [ sec_discussion ] , the analytical expression of the local cpd is derived and discussed to be put in relation with the experimental observations .",
    "the implications for kpfm experiments are discussed as well .",

    "the metallic tip is biased with respect to a metallic counter - electrode placed a few millimeters far from it owing to the thickness of the ionic crystal .",

    "the dielectric sample is an alkali halide crystal like nacl , kbr , kcl with a fcc structure and a lattice constant @xmath10 ( _ cf . _",
    "fig.[fig_geom]a ) . in the area where the tip is",
    ", the model assumes that the crystal carries neither net charge , nor local dipole .",
    "its thickness @xmath11 is much larger than all other distances of the problem , typically a few millimeters . below the surface ,",
    "the crystal is treated as a continuous dielectric medium with a dielectric permittivity @xmath12 . at the surface ,",
    "the atomic corrugation of the crystal is described by a single layer of alternate point charges arranged with a fcc structure perpendicular to the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the layer extends infinitely in the plane direction .",
    "the motivation for such a rationalization of the problem will be justified in section ( [ sec_sigma_mu ] ) .",
    "the crystal lies on a metallic sample holder ( hereafter referred to as the counter - electrode ) , with respect to which the tip is biased .",
    "the counter - electrode is a planar and perfect conductor .",
    "the tip is also assumed to be a perfect conductor which is biased at @xmath13 . in order to preserve the analyticity of the model , the electrostatic boundary - value problem",
    "is restricted to a tip with a very simple apex geometry , namely : a hemispherical mesoscopic part ( radius @xmath14  nm ) on top of which is half - embedded a small spherical asperity ( radius @xmath15 ) .",
    "the contributions of the cantilever and of the macroscopic part of the tip to which the apex is connected to are assumed to be negligible .",
    "this issue will be justified in section [ sec_force_m ] .",
    "the tip - surface distance is denoted @xmath16 ( typically a few   ) .",
    "the electric field @xmath17 produced locally between the tip , the dielectric , and the counter - electrode polarizes the ionic crystal , which acquires a macroscopic polarization @xmath18 oriented along @xmath17 . in the former equation , @xmath19 is the number of polarizable species _ per _ unit volume and @xmath20 , the local dipolar moment _ per _ unit cell . in kpfm , the bias voltage @xmath13 is modulated at frequencies which do not influence the electronic polarization of the ions .",
    "the major part of the crystal polarization has rather an ionic character , _",
    "i.e. _ a net displacement in opposite directions of the ions due to their charge @xmath21 with respect to their equilibrium positions , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , @xmath1 being the elementary electrical charge .",
    "the polarization effect occurs as well at the crystal surface , where the positions of the ions become modulated perpendicularly to the surface plane , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 , as sketched in figs.[fig_geom]b and d. @xmath25 is proportional to the local electric field @xmath26 at any ionic site and to the total polarizability of the dielectric restricted , in our approach , to the ionic polarizability @xmath27 ( ref . [ ] ) .",
    "usually , @xmath26 differs from the external electric field @xmath17 due to the biased tip because @xmath26 explicitly depends on the polarization of the dielectric .",
    "the lorentz s model links @xmath26 and @xmath17 ( ref .",
    "[ ] ) , thus , @xmath20 is written :    @xmath28    with @xmath29 , the dielectric susceptibility of the sample . in the former equation ,",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath20 depends on @xmath17 and hence on the bias voltage @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , this is also true for @xmath25 . for the sake of discussions ,",
    "the bias dependence will henceforth be explicitly outlined @xmath30 . despite @xmath31",
    "can not be estimated at this point , it is crucial to keep in mind that the sample surface is polarized by the influence of the bias since this is a key aspect of the origin of the cpd atomic contrast .",
    "our approach of the electrostatic boundary - value problem relies on an _ ad hoc _ assumption .",
    "the tip , being a perfect conductor , develops a surface charge density @xmath32 , the origin of which is split into two main contributions @xmath33 , namely :    * a charge density @xmath34 due to the capacitor formed between the biased tip and the counter - electrode with the dielectric in between ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig.[fig_geom]c ) .",
    "owing to the distance between the electrodes , _",
    "i.e. _ roughly the dielectric thickness @xmath11 , @xmath34 has a mesoscopic character .",
    "it is not influenced by the local structure of the tip apex , but rather by its overall shape . *",
    "a charge density @xmath35 originating from the madelung potential that expands at the crystal surface .",
    "when the tip is at a distance @xmath16 where the potential is effective , typically a few ngstrms , then it develops , in addition to @xmath34 , a surface charge density @xmath36 ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig.[fig_geom]d ) .",
    "@xmath35 has a microscopic character and must strongly depend on the local structure of the tip apex and on @xmath16 .    despite the simple tip geometry that has been assumed",
    ", the calculation of the electrostatic force acting on it due to the combined influence of the capacitive coupling and of the madelung surface potential has no exact analytical solution .",
    "nevertheless , one can build up an approximate solution to the boundary - value problem relying on the superposition principle .",
    "for that purpose , the problem is split up into two boundary - value sub - problems schemed in figs.[fig_geom]c and d :    * problem @xmath37 : the tip biased at @xmath13 in front of a dielectric continuous medium ( height @xmath11 , dielectric permittivity @xmath12 ) held on an infinite planar conductor , the counter - electrode ( fig.[fig_geom]c ) .",
    "the local structure of the dielectric is not supposed to influence the tip .",
    "this is the description of the  capacitive \" problem , the solution of which provides the surface charge density @xmath34 . *",
    "problem @xmath38 : the tip now biased at 0  v with an infinite plane of alternate point charges located at the same distance than the surface of the dielectric in problem a , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 .",
    "the layer of point charges is polarized under the electric field that occurs in problem a ( fig.[fig_geom]d ) .",
    "this describes the  microscopic \" problem .",
    "the solution provides the surface charge density @xmath36 .    besides , in order to carry out the calculations more easily , it is convenient to distinguish the two following geometrical areas on the tip ( _ cf . _",
    "fig.[fig_geom]d ) , namely : the asperity , area ( 1 ) , _ i.e. _ a half - sphere with radius @xmath39 and the mesoscopic tip apex around it , area ( 2 ) , a sphere with radius @xmath40 ( typically @xmath41 ) . these two areas do not overlap , but the continuity between them is ensured .",
    "the vertical force acting on the tip@xcite is written in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath36 as described above :    @xmath42    @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the normal to the tip surface and the unitary vector along the vertical @xmath45 axis of the problem , respectively .",
    "doing so , we only focus on the vertical resultant of the force acting onto the tip .",
    "the above expression can be expanded into three components : a purely capacitive part , @xmath46 originating from the tip / dielectric / counter - electrode capacitor ; a coupling part , @xmath47 , which can be interpreted in terms of the resulting force of all the elementary forces due to the electric field @xmath48 onto each elementary charge @xmath49 produced on the tip by the influence of the madelung potential of the crystal , @xmath50 ; and a purely microscopic part , @xmath51 , standing for the short - range electrostatic force due to @xmath50 .",
    "although the boundary - value problem of a planar conductor biased with respect to another one with an incomplete dielectric layer in between yields an expression of the surface charge density , the problem with the sphere does not .",
    "however , one can argue that the expression of @xmath34 must be a combination between a configuration in which there is no dielectric medium in the sphere / counter - electrode interface and an opposite one , where the interface is completely filled with it .",
    "one can therefore postulate an effective dielectric permittivity @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a constant to be set .",
    "owing to the fact that the mesoscopic part of the tip apex , referred to as area ( 2 ) , is located at a distance @xmath54 from the counter - electrode , the analytical expression of @xmath55 , explicitly calculated in refs .",
    "[ ] , asymptotically trends towards the surface charge density of an isolated , biased sphere @xcite :    @xmath56    to get the surface charge density on area ( 1 ) , @xmath57 , we seek the potential @xmath58 which equals @xmath13 over the asperity .",
    "for that purpose , a spherical coordinate system @xmath59 centered on the asperity is chosen .",
    "the problem having an azimuthal symmetry , the sought potential can be expanded in legendre polynomials @xcite :    @xmath60    at large distance from the asperity , @xmath61 , the potential must be similar to the one of a sphere with radius @xmath62 biased at @xmath13 , namely @xcite :    @xmath63    hence , the coefficients @xmath64 of the expansion are known .",
    "the coefficients @xmath65 are deduced from the property of orthogonality of the legendre polynomials at the boundary condition @xmath66 .",
    "the potential is finally written :    @xmath67p_n(\\cos \\theta ) \\right\\}\\ ] ]    the former equation rigorously describes the potential of a system apex / asperity where the junction point between the two spheres is smoothed and not singular , as sketched in fig.[fig_geom]d .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath68 , the influence of the singular area is negligible .",
    "therefore , equ.[equ_potential_vm1 ] is a good approximation to the boundary - value problem .",
    "the normal derivation along the surface of the asperity yields the expression of @xmath57 :    @xmath69    owing to the condition @xmath68 , the sum can be restricted to the first term . therefore :    @xmath70    thus , despite @xmath57 develops on the asperity , its strength is governed by the radius of the mesoscopic part of the tip apex , @xmath62 and not by the local radius of curvature of the asperity , @xmath39 .      the calculation of the surface charge density @xmath35 on the mesoscopic sphere+asperity is more tedious , primarily because it relies on the estimation of the madelung potential of the ionic crystal , @xmath50 .",
    "the boundary - value problem is now restricted to the determination of the surface charge density arising on a metallic tip at zero potential under the influence of an infinite planar slab of point charges .",
    "again , the solution of such a problem has no straightforward analytical solution .",
    "however , we can again use the condition @xmath68 , as depicted , to some extend , in fig.[fig_geom]d . consequently , the mesoscopic part of the apex can be assumed as equivalent to an infinite planar conductor , at least in a small area along the sides of the asperity ( light grey area in fig.[fig_geom]d ) . the new boundary - value problem defined by an infinite planar conductor influencing another infinite planar conductor at zero potential carrying a hemispherical bump with a radius @xmath39 ,",
    "now yields a solution @xcite .",
    "the method of the image charges is used to solve it .",
    "the first set of image charges ensuring a zero - potential value on the counter - electrode@xcite produces an electric field which influences the tip .",
    "but as a matter of fact , this contribution can be neglected because the distance between the tip and the counter - electrode is on the millimeter range and the image charges originate from the madelung potential , which is known to decay exponentially fast@xcite ( _ cf .",
    "_ also hereafter ) .",
    "the second set of image charges@xcite is quasi - punctual and located at the center of the asperity .",
    "hence , owing to the simplified geometry of the electrode , the problem is reduced to a sphere with radius @xmath39 at zero potential in the influence of two infinite planes , _",
    "i.e. _ the slab and its image , which are anti - symmetrically spaced with respect to the sphere .",
    "this procedure ensures a zero - potential on the approximated plane within which the asperity is embedded .",
    "again , it is more convenient to use a spherical coordinate system centered on the asperity . then , the surface charge density @xmath71 is derived by normal derivation along areas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , namely :    @xmath72    the potential @xmath73 is derived from the madelung potential of the ionic crystal , previously referred to as @xmath50 , by the method of the image charges and the kelvin transform ( influence on a sphere biased at zero potential)@xcite , namely :    @xmath74    the former equation fulfills the boundary condition @xmath75 everywhere along the surface asperity or along the surface of the local planar area around it .",
    "@xmath50 can be estimated on the base of the work by watson _",
    "_ @xcite . when considering an infinite planar slab of point charges , the authors state that the potential , so - called madelung surface potential , reaches its asymptotic value in a very short distance normal to the slab .",
    "consequently , the ions within the crystal at a distance only one lattice constant from the surface have madelung potentials which are indistinguishable from those of the bulk .",
    "in other words , _ the tip will mainly be influenced by the surface potential and not by the one arising from the bulk part of the ionic crystal .",
    "_ this is why a single , infinite , layer of point charges is enough to describe the influence of the madelung surface potential on the tip , which motivates our initial assumption .",
    "the potential is written :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the polar vector of any ion of the surface slab in an orthogonal basis @xmath78 , @xmath79 being the projection of the center of the asperity on the surface , @xmath80 and @xmath81 the unitary vectors of the fcc unit cell . the summation is performed over the vectors @xmath82 of the reciprocal lattice of an arbitrarily defined unit cell and @xmath83 is proportional to the lattice constant @xmath10 of the fcc unit cell .",

    "its planar and perpendicular coordinates from the origin of the cell are given by the two vectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the latter reflects the polarization effect felt by the ion within the unit cell , previously referred to as @xmath31 . in equ.[equ_structure_factor ] , it is assumed that the polarization of the ions extends all over the ( 001 ) surface plane . in any case",
    ", it must extend over an much larger area than the tip asperity .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the electric field produced by area ( 2 ) , which is constant within an area roughly scaling as the mesoscopic tip radius @xmath62 .",

    "therefore the above discussion stands within a narrow range of distances from the surface , typically a few times the asperity radius .",
    "nevertheless , an increase of the measured local cpd as a function of the distance is still expected to occur if the distance dependence in @xmath240 decays faster than the one in @xmath216 . in other words",
    "@xmath205 must increase with the distance as soon as the distance dependence of the force induced by the influence of the madelung surface potential on the mesoscopic part of the tip decays faster than the one of the force induced on the asperity due to the capacitive coupling with the image charges of the surface .",
    "let us finally point out that such a distance dependence of the cpd might make the experimental achievement of the atomic contrast easier , which strengthens the argument of an intrinsic imaging process of the local cpd .",
    "indeed , no major tip and/or surface distortion is expected to occur in an equivalent range of distance ( @xmath256   , ref .",
