    "time series analysis is a central topic in physics , as well as a powerful method to characterize data in biology , medicine and economics , and to understand their underlying dynamical origin . in the last decades",
    ", the topic has received input from different disciplines such as nonlinear dynamics , statistical physics , computer science or bayesian statistics and , as a result , new approaches like nonlinear time series analysis  @xcite or data mining  @xcite have emerged .",
    "more recently , the science of complex networks @xcite has fostered the growth of a novel approach to time series analysis based on the transformation of a time series into a network according to some specified mapping algorithm , and on the subsequent extraction of information about the time series through the analysis of the derived network . within this approach ,",
    "a classical possibility is to interpret the interdependencies between time series ( encapsulated for instance in cross - correlation matrices ) as the weighted edges of a graph whose nodes label each time series , yielding so called functional networks , that have been used fruitfully and extensively in different fields such as neuroscience @xcite or finance @xcite . a more recent perspective deals with mapping the particular structure of univariate time series into abstract graphs @xcite , with the aims of describing not the correlation between different series , but the overall structure of isolated time series , in purely graph - theoretical terms . among these latter approaches ,",
    "the so called visibility algorithms @xcite have been shown to be simple , computationally efficient and analytically tractable methods @xcite , able to extract nontrivial information about the original signal @xcite , classify different dynamical origins @xcite and provide a clean description of low dimensional dynamics @xcite . as a consequence , this particular methodology has been used in different domains including earth and planetary sciences @xcite , finance @xcite or biomedical fields @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . despite their success",
    ", the range of applicability of visibility methods has been so far limited to univariate time series , whereas the most challenging problems in several areas of nonlinear science concern systems governed by a large number of degrees of freedom , whose evolution is indeed described by multivariate time series .    }",

    "multiplex visibility graph _ @xmath0 , i.e. a multi - layer network where each layer @xmath1 is the hvg of the @xmath1-th component of the time series . ]        in order to fill this gap , in this work we introduce a visibility approach to analyze multivariate time series based on the mapping of a multidimensional signal into an appropriately defined multi - layer network  @xcite , which we call _ multiplex visibility graph_. taking advantage of the recent development in the theory of multilayer networks @xcite , new information can be extracted from the original multivariate time series , with the aims of describing signals in graph - theoretical terms or to construct novel feature vectors to feed automatic classifiers in a simple , accurate and computationally efficient way .",
    "we will show that , among other possibilities , a particular projection of this multilayer network produces a ( single - layer ) network similar in spirit to functional networks , while being more accurate than standard methodologies to construct these .",
    "we validate our method by investigating the rich high - dimensional dynamics displayed by canonical models of spatio - temporal chaos , and then apply our framework to describe and quantify periods of financial instability from a set of empirical multivariate financial time series .",
    "let us start by recalling that visibility algorithms are a family of geometric criteria which define different ways of mapping an ordered series , for instance a temporal series of @xmath2 real - valued data @xmath3 , into a graph of @xmath2 nodes .",
    "the standard linking criteria are the natural visibility @xcite ( a convexity criterion ) and the horizontal visibility @xcite ( an ordering criterion ) . in the latter version , two nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are linked by an edge if the associated data @xmath6 and @xmath7 have horizontal visibility , i.e. if every intermediate datum @xmath8 satisfies the ordering relation @xmath9 the resulting horizontal visibility graph ( hvg ) is an outerplanar graph ( indeed a subgraph of the original visibility graph ) , whose topological properties have been shown to be analytically tractable for a large class of different dynamical processes @xcite .",
    "both the natural and horizontal graphs are undirected , however directed graphs can be easily constructed by by distinguishing ingoing from outgoing links with respect to the arrow of time , something which has proven useful to assess time asymmetries and to quantify time series irreversibility  @xcite . consider a @xmath10-dimensional real valued time series @xmath11 , with @xmath12}}(t ) , x{^{[2]}}(t),\\ldots , x{^{[m]}}(t))\\in\\mathbb{r}^m$ ] for any value of @xmath13 , measured empirically or extracted from a @xmath10-dimensional , either deterministic or stochastic , dynamical system .",
    "an @xmath10-layer multiplex network , that we call the _ multiplex visibility graph _ @xmath0 is then constructed , where layer @xmath1 corresponds to the hvg associated to the time series of state variable @xmath14}}(t ) \\}_{t=1}^n$ ] .",
    "we illustrate this procedure for @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] .",
    "note that in this work we focus on the undirected , horizontal version , but other visibility linking criteria can be analogously used to define different multiplex versions .",

    "this builds a bridge between multivariate series analysis and the recent developments in the study of multilayer networks @xcite . among the different possible multiplex measures that with our mapping is now possible to exploit also in the context of multidimensional time series",
    ", we focus here on one which allows to detect and quantify inter - layer degree correlations  @xcite .",
    "in such a way we can characterize information shared across variables ( layers ) of the underlying high dimensional system , this aspect being indeed of capital importance in fields such as neuroscience or economics and finance .",

    "in general , the higher @xmath26 the more correlated the degree distributions of the two layers and , therefore , the structure of the associated time series . if we then average the quantity @xmath22 over every possible pair of layers of @xmath0 , we obtain a scalar variable @xmath27 which captures the typical amount of information flow in the system . of course",
    ", the values @xmath28 can be considered as the weights of the edges of a _ graph of layers _",
    "@xmath29 , this being a projection of the original multiplex visibility graph @xmath30 into a ( single - layer ) weighted graph of @xmath10 nodes , where each node represents one layer .",
    "edges in this case denote mutual information , but our approach can be easily generalized so that edges can represent different types of interdependence , such as correlation  @xcite , causality  @xcite , etc .",
    "@xcite between layers .",
    "hence for this particular projection , one is actually analyzing the visibility analog of standard functional networks .",
    "we shall indeed see that the multiplex projection is genuinely different and often works better than other ways to construct functional networks .",
    "this is mainly because the latters often require , to compute the weight of each edge , the symbolization of each time series , and this pre - processing is usually afflicted by several limitations and ambiguities @xcite .",
    "as we show in the online supplementary information ( si ) , the technique proposed here also appears to be free from these well known ambiguities .",
    "+          as a case study we first consider diffusively coupled map lattices ( cmls ) , high - dimensional dynamical systems with discrete time and continuous state variables , widely used to model complex spatio - temporal dynamics  @xcite in as disparate contexts as turbulence @xcite , or vacuum fluctuations and dark energy @xcite .",
    "namely we consider a ring of @xmath10 sites , and we assume that the dynamical evolution of the state @xmath31}}$ ] of site @xmath1 is determined by : @xmath32}}(t+1 ) = ( 1-\\epsilon)f[x{^{[\\alpha]}}(t ) ] +    \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\bigg(f[x{^{[\\alpha-1]}}(t)]+f[x{^{[\\alpha+1]}}(t)]\\bigg ) , \\label{cml}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33 , where @xmath34 $ ] is the coupling strength , and @xmath35 is typically a chaotic map . for different values of @xmath36 and @xmath10 cmls display a very rich phase diagram , which includes different degrees of synchronization and dynamical phases such as fully developed turbulence ( fdt , a phase with incoherent spatiotemporal chaos and high dimensional attractor ) , pattern selection ( ps , a sharp suppression of chaos in favor of a randomly selected periodic attractor ) , or different forms of spatio - temporal intermittency ( sti , a chaotic phase with low dimensional attractor ) . the origin of such a rich and intertwined structure comes from the interplay between the local tendency towards inhomogeneity , induced by the chaotic dynamics , and the global tendency towards homogeneity in space , induced by the diffusive coupling . fig .",
    "[ comparison ] report the results obtained for a cml of @xmath37 diffusively coupled , fully chaotic logistic maps @xmath38 , which exhibits several transitions from high dimensional chaos , to pattern selection , to several forms of partially synchronized chaotic states when @xmath36 is increased .",
    "the plots of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] are based on averages over 100 realisations of the cml dynamics . for each realisation",
    ", we constructed a multivariate time series @xmath39 of @xmath40 data points ( discarding the transient ) and we generated the corresponding multiplex visibility graph . in fig .",
    "[ comparison](b ) we show how the average mutual information @xmath41 of the multiplex visibility graph associated to the system ( see si for other multiplex measures ) is able to distinguish between the different phases . in particular , @xmath41 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath36 in the fdt phases , and therefore quantifies the amount of information flow among units .",
    "notably , it also detects qualitative changes in the underlying dynamics ( such as the chaos suppression in favor of a randomly selected periodic pattern , or the onset of a multi - band chaotic attractor during intermittency ) and therefore can be used as a scalar order parameter of the system . for comparison , in fig.[comparison](c ) we also plot the corresponding quantity derived from a standard functional network analysis .",
    "namely , @xmath42 is the average mutual information computed directly on the multivariate time series , after performing the necessary time series symbolization .",
    "although there are qualitatively similarities , subtle aspects such as the monotonic increase of synchronization with @xmath36 in fdt , or the onset of multiband attractors in sti are not captured by @xmath42 ( additional details comparing our method to standard functional network approaches can be found in the si ) . in panel",
    "( a ) of the same figure we also report the projections of the three multiplex networks @xmath0 into the corresponding graphs of layers @xmath43 , whose edge widths are proportional to the values @xmath44 of mutual information between layers @xmath1 and @xmath19 .",
    "a simple visual inspection of such graphs reveals the different type of information flow among units , depending on the dynamical phases of the system . in particular ,",
    "notice that the diffusive nature of the coupling emerges in the ring - like structure of graph @xmath43 corresponding to weakly interacting maps ( fdt ) ( the analysis is extended in si to globally coupled maps , these being a mean - field version of cml where complete synchronisation is possible , showing that our method correctly detects the onset of this new regime ) .",
    "the previous study suggests that the quantities @xmath45 ( see fig .  [ comparison](a ) ) accurately capture relevant information of the underlying dynamics . to further explore this aspect and to assess scalability",
    ", we considered a chain of @xmath46 diffusively coupled logistic maps , each governed by eq .",
    "( [ cml ] ) .",
    "new short dynamical phases , such as the so called brownian motion of defects ( bd ) a transient phase between fdt and ps , emerge when the dimension of the system is increased , and as the description gets more cumbersome , projections and coarse - grained variables are needed  @xcite . since the graph of layers @xmath29 is by construction a complete graph ( just as any functional network ) , for visual reasons in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we report the structural properties of @xmath47 , the backbone of @xmath29 obtained starting from an empty graph of @xmath10 nodes and adding edges sequentially in decreasing order of @xmath22 , until the resulting graph consists of a single connected component .",
    "the structure of @xmath47 is unique for each phase and qualitatively different across phases , thus providing a simple qualitative way to portrait different dynamics in high - dimensional systems . +          as an example of the possible applications of the multiplex visibility graph approach to the analysis of real - world multivariate time series , we report a study of the prices of financial assets .",
    "namely , we considered the time evolution of stock prices of @xmath48 of the largest us companies by market capitalization from nyse and nasdaq ( see si for details ) over the period 1998 - 2013 .",
    "the @xmath10 time series have a very high resolution ( one data per minute ) , yielding @xmath49 data per company .",
    "we divided each multivariate time series into non - overlapping periods of three months ( quarters ) , and we constructed a _",
    "temporal _ multiplex visibility graph consisting of 64 multilayer snapshots , each formed by the 35-layer multiplex visibility graph corresponding to one of the 3-months periods .",
    "we then investigated the time evolution of the multiplex mutual information among layers , and how this correlates to the presence of periods of financial instability .    in fig .",
    "[ miseries_refined](a ) we plot the value of the average multiplex mutual information @xmath41 as a function of time . for comparison",
    "we also report in fig .",
    "[ miseries_refined](b ) the analogous measure computed directly on the original series , after an appropriate symbolization ( see si for details ) .",
    "we find that the multiplex visibility graph approach captures the onset of the major periods of financial instability ( 1998 - 1999 , corresponding to the .com bubble , and 2007 - 2012 , corresponding to the great recession that took place as a consequence of the mortgage subprime crisis ) , which are characterised by a relatively increased synchronisation of stock prices , clearly distinguishing them from the seemingly unsynchronised interval 2001 - 2007 , which in turn corresponds to a more stable period of the economy . in direct analogy with the language used for cmls",
    ", we could say that in periods of financial stability , the system is close to equilibrium , degrees of freedom are evolving in a quasi - independent way , reaching a fully developed turbulent state of low mutual information ( hence unpredictable and efficient from a financial viewpoint ) . on the other hand , during periods of financial instability ( bubbles and crisis ) the system is externally perturbed , hence driven away from equilibrium , and the degrees of freedom share larger mutual information ( the system is therefore less unpredictable and inefficient from a financial viewpoint ) . as shown in figure [ miseries_refined](b ) , an analogous analysis based on the symbolization of the time series fails to capture all such details ( see si for additional analysis ) . finally , as also seen in the case of the multiplex visibility graphs associated to cmls , the differences in the values of average mutual information corresponding to different phases are indeed related to a different underlying structure of the network of layers . in fig.[miseries_refined ]",
    "we show the maximal spanning trees ( mst ) of the networks of layers associated to six typical time windows  @xcite .",
    "the three networks at the bottom of the figure represents periods of financial stability , while those at the top of the figure correspond to the three local maxima of mutual information .",
    "interestingly , the msts in periods of financial instability all have a massive hub which is directly linked to as much as @xmath50 of all the other nodes .",
    "conversely , the degree is more evenly distributed in the msts associated to periods of economic stability .",
    "the approach based on multiplex visibility graphs introduced in this work provides an alternative and powerful method to analyze multivariate time series .",
    "we have first validated our method focusing on signals whose underlying dynamics is well known and showing that measures describing the structure of the corresponding multiplex networks ( which are not affected by the usual problems of standard symbolization procedures ) are able to capture and quantify the onset of dynamical phases in high - dimensional coupled chaotic maps , as well as the increase or decrease of mutual information among layers ( maps ) within each phase .",
    "we then have studied an application to the analysis of multivariate financial series , showing that multiplex measures , differently from other standard methods , can easily distinguish periods of financial stability from crises , and can thus be used effectively as a support tool in decision making .",
    "+ the proposed method is extremely flexible and can be used in all situations where the dynamics is poorly understood or unknown , with potential applications ranging from fluid dynamics to neuroscience or social sciences . in this article we have focused only on a particular aspect , which is the characterization of the information flow among the different variables of the system , and we have consequently based our analysis on the study of the resulting networks of layers . however , our approach is quite general , and the mapping of multivariate time series into multiplex visibility graphs paves the way to the study of the relationship between specific structural descriptors recently introduced in the context of multiplex networks and the properties of real - world dynamical systems .",
