    "the idea is that a real zero very close to  @xmath43 of @xmath44 would have a profound effect on the zeros of the riemann zeta - function : in a certain range all the zeros would be on the critical line and would have a peculiar spacing .",

    "montgomery s result , however , only allows one to conclude that @xmath50 a positive proportion of the time .",
    "montgomery refers to the connection to landau - siegel zeros in his paper  @xcite , and similar connections are mentioned in unpublished work of heath - brown . at present",
    "the only published account is due to conrey and iwaniec  @xcite .",
    "they show that the existence of landau - siegel zeros implies that , in a certain range , most of the spacings between consecutive zeros of the zeta function are close to multiples of half the average spacing .",
    "that is , @xmath51 is close to @xmath52 or @xmath43 , or @xmath53 , etc .",
    "although conrey and iwaniec give explicit estimates only in the case of small spacings between zeros , their main result can be used to show , for example , that if @xmath51 was often close to @xmath54 , then there are no landau - siegel zeros . the estimates in such cases , however , have not been worked out yet .",
    "if the statistics of the zeros of the zeta - function are governed by random matrix theory ( rmt ) , then one could immediately conclude there are no landau - siegel zeros because the neighbor spacing is supported on all of @xmath55 .",
    "since there are no immediate prospects of proving that the zeros of the zeta - function follow random matrix statistics ( or disproving landau - siegel zeros by another method ) , it is interesting to probe the boundary of what distributions are possible for zeros of the zeta - function .",
    "the following has been proposed as a test case :    * the alternative hypothesis ( ah ) * _ there exists a real number @xmath56 such that if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 that is , almost all the normalized neighbor spacings are an integer or half - integer .",

    "thus , one could disprove ah by showing that more than 30% of the normalized neighbor gaps of @xmath7 are less than @xmath70 .",

    "this is discussed further in the next subsection .",
    "one wonders whether ah and the existing results on zero correlations determine the distribution of neighbor spacings . to specify",
    "@xmath72 seems to require using the triple correlation @xmath59 to determine how often two consecutive normalized neighbor gaps of size  @xmath52 can occur .",
    "so this question may be equivalent to the question of whether ah determines all the correlation functions .",

    "@xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the von  mangoldt function : @xmath78",
    "if @xmath79 with @xmath80 prime , and @xmath29 otherwise . montgomery and soundararajan  @xcite interpret as saying @xmath81 has mean @xmath74 and variance @xmath82 , and they note that the cramr model of the primes predicts a larger variance of @xmath83 .",
    "it would be interesting to see what the right - hand side of equals if one assumes the alternative hypothesis .",
    "these connections indicate the value of studying the statistics of the zeros of the zeta - function .",
    "we now explain the connection to the zeros of  @xmath12 .",
    "the statistics of the zeros of @xmath12 are interesting because of their connection with the alternative hypothesis and also as an illustration of the general behavior of the zeros of derivatives of an entire function upon repeated differentiation .",
    "one motivation for studying the analogue of montgomery s function for the zeros of @xmath12 is the expectation that our theorem  [ thm : f1 ] might contradict  ah .",
    "the zeros of @xmath12 are influenced by the zeros of @xmath7 in complicated ways , so it seems unlikely that rmt and ah would predict the same behavior for @xmath84 for @xmath27 .",
    "but there are several caveats .",
    "first , as described in the previous section , it is not known whether or not ah determines all the correlation functions of the zeros .",
    "this may lead to some flexibility in @xmath84 for @xmath27 , which may be consistent with theorem  [ thm : f1 ] .",
    "second , it is not known how to transfer a measure on the zeros of @xmath7 to a measure on the zeros of  @xmath12 .",
    "thus , even if ah determined all the correlations of the zeros of  @xmath7 , it is still an unsolved problem to determine the correlations of the zeros of  @xmath12 .",
    "third , merely contradicting ah is not sufficient to disprove the existence of landau - siegel zeros .",
    "ah  is an extreme example of a possible consequence of landau - siegel zeros .",
    "presumably an extension of the work of conrey and iwaniec  @xcite would show that landau - siegel zeros imply that @xmath25 approximately follows figure  [ fig : ah ] for some range of  @xmath60 .",
    "another motivation is to understand the general behavior of zeros under differentiation .",
    "the riemann @xmath85-function is defined as @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath85-function is an entire function of order  1 that is real on the real axis . for such functions ,",
    "repeated differentiation causes the zeros to migrate to the real axis  @xcite .",
    "thus , in any bounded region the riemann hypothesis is true for the @xmath87th derivative @xmath88 for sufficiently large  @xmath87 .",
    "it is conjectured  @xcite that for real entire functions of order  1 , whose zeros lie in a strip around the real axis , not only do the zeros migrate toward the real axis , but they also approach equal spacing",
    ". that is , the derivatives approach a multiple of @xmath89 .",
    "this conjecture has been proven with some restrictions on the distribution of zeros  @xcite and for some special cases , such as the @xmath85-function  @xcite and the reciprocal of the gamma function  @xcite .",
    "the reason differentiation leads to equally spaced zeros is that , locally , the zeros of @xmath90 move away from concentrations of zeros of @xmath91 and towards regions with fewer zeros of  @xmath91 .",
    "thus , small gaps become larger and large gaps become smaller .",
    "figure  [ fig : xiplot ] illustrates these ideas .    [ 1.3 ] , and the dots are the zeros of  @xmath90.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a consequence is that if @xmath12 has a small gap between consecutive zeros , then @xmath7 must have had an even smaller gap .",
    "thus , one should expect that the existence of landau - siegel zeros could be disproven by showing that @xmath12 has sufficiently many zeros separated by less than half the average spacing .",
    "that is , one should be able to extend the result of conrey - iwaniec  @xcite to the zeros of @xmath92 for any @xmath93 .",
    "however , we have not worked out the necessary details to show that the required number of small gaps between zeros of @xmath12 leads to the same number of small gaps between the zeros of  @xmath7 .",
    "thus , at present we just mention this as a motivating principle .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "based on these ideas , we see that corollary  [ cor : xipgaps ] does not contradict the alternative hypothesis . on average",
    "each normalized gap of size @xmath52 is adjacent to a gap of size @xmath52 or  @xmath43 , so ah implies that at least 29.7% of the normalized neighbor gaps of @xmath12 are smaller than  1 . if corollary  [ cor : xipgaps ] could be improved to show that @xmath12 has normalized zero gaps smaller than  @xmath94 , then that would imply , on ah , that @xmath7 has consecutive gaps of size  @xmath52 .",
    "our final motivation is to understand the manner in which differentiation causes the zeros to become equally spaced .",
    "let @xmath95 denote the analogue of @xmath35 involving the zeros of  @xmath96 rather than the zeros of  @xmath97 .",
    "since the zeros of @xmath96 approach equal spacing as @xmath87 increases , @xmath95 approaches a sum of dirac @xmath28-functions supported at the integers .",
    "we would like to understand this transition to a sum of @xmath28-functions .",
    "the only case we know of where this has been worked out explicitly is for random trigonometric polynomials  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm : f1 ] is a first step in this direction , and figure  [ fig : f1 ] does seem to illustrate the expected behavior . in a recent ph.d .",
    "thesis , jim bian has now worked out explicit formulas for @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath27 .",
    "it would be interesting to know the random matrix analogue of theorem  [ thm : f1 ] . at present , this is one of the few calculations carried out for the riemann zeta - function for which a random matrix analogue seems out of reach .",
    "one issue is that in the random matrix world there seems to be no direct analogue of the riemann @xmath7-function .",
    "see section 1.2 of @xcite for a discussion .",
    "the closest match is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix from the unitary group  @xmath102 , chosen uniformly with respect to haar measure .",
    "however , this is more nearly an analogue of the hardy @xmath103-function defined by @xmath104 .",
    "this was the motivation of conrey and soundararajan  @xcite , who did similar calculations to ours for the @xmath103-function .",
    "but it turns out that the zeros of @xmath105 and @xmath106 should have similar correlation functions .",
    "since @xmath107 is approximately @xmath108 , the corresponding zeros of @xmath105 and @xmath106 generally differ by @xmath109 .",
    "so one should expect the correlation functions of their zeros to be equal , to leading order .",
    "we provide a more rigorous explanation in section  [ sec : z ] . and those correlation functions should equal , to leading order , the correlation function of the zeros of the derivative of the completed characteristic polynomial  .",
    "the general outline of our calculation is similar to the case of zeros of the zeta - function .",
    "we start with an explicit formula relating a sum over zeros of @xmath12 to a sum involving number - theoretic expressions , and then compute the mean - square of both sides .",
    "our main complication is that the number - theoretic side of the explicit formula is not a dirichlet series , but an `` approximate '' dirichlet series , by which we mean a dirichlet series whose coefficients may depend on  @xmath110 .",
    "the explicit formula is derived in section  [ sec : explicitformula ] .",
    "here we just outline the calculation and state the formula .",
    "we begin by noting that @xmath111 has simple poles with residue  1 at the zeros of @xmath11 and no others ; here zeros are counted as many times as their multiplicity .",
    "our first goal is to write @xmath111 as an `` approximate '' dirichlet series . from the definition of the @xmath7-function",
    "we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the region @xmath115 , @xmath116 , say .",

    "simple estimates of @xmath123 and @xmath128 will be used repeatedly .",
