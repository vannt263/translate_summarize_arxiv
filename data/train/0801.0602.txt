    "the essential breakthrough in the understanding of the origin of the large  scale magnetic fields of cosmic objects came with the development of mean  field dynamo theory .",
    "a central component of this theory is the @xmath0effect , that is , a mean electromotive force with a component parallel or antiparallel to the mean magnetic field in a turbulently moving electrically conducting fluid .",
    "the @xmath0effect , which occurs naturally in inhomogeneous turbulence on a rotating body , is a crucial element of the dynamo mechanisms proposed and widely accepted for the sun and planets , for other stellar objects and even for galaxies ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    in the majority of investigations",
    "this effect has been merely calculated in the so - called second  order correlation approximation ( soca ) , or first ",
    "order smoothing approximation ( fosa ) , which ignores all contributions of higher than second order in the turbulent part of the fluid velocity .",
    "moreover in many cases attention has been focussed on the high  conductivity limit only , which can be roughly characterized by short correlation times of the turbulent motion in comparison to the magnetic  field decay time for a turbulent eddy . under these circumstances",
    "the @xmath0effect is closely connected with some average over the kinetic helicity of the turbulent motion , that is , of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 means the turbulent part of the fluid velocity , @xmath3 the corresponding vorticity , @xmath4 ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the coefficient @xmath0 for isotropic turbulence turns out to be equal to @xmath5 , often expressed in the form @xmath6 with equal arguments of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and some appropriate time @xmath7 .",
    "here and in what follows overbars indicate averages . for anisotropic turbulence",
    "the trace of the @xmath0tensor is just equal to three times this value of @xmath0 .",
    "these findings have been sometimes overinterpreted in the sense that mean  field dynamos , or even dynamos at all , might not work without kinetic helicity of the fluid motion , that is , if @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "there exist however several counter  examples .",
    "firstly , the mean - field dynamo theory offers also dynamo mechanisms without @xmath0effect , for which the average of the kinetic helicity may well be equal to zero .",
    "for instance , a combination of the so  called @xmath8effect , which may occur even in the case of homogeneous turbulence in a rotating body , with shear associated with differential rotation , can act as a dynamo @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a dynamo due to turbulence influenced by large - scale shear and the shear flow itself @xcite is still under debate @xcite .",
    "secondly , in dynamo theory beyond the mean  field concept a number of examples of dynamos without kinetic helicity are known .",
    "the dynamo proposed by herzenberg @xcite , usually considered as the first existence proof for homogeneous dynamos at all , works without kinetic helicity . likewise in the dynamo models of gailitis working with an axisymmetric meridional circulation in cylindrical or spherical geometry @xcite",
    "there is no kinetic helicity .",
    "we mention here further the dynamo in a layer with hexagonal convection cells proposed by zheligovsky and galloway @xcite , in which the kinetic helicity is zero everywhere .",
    "thirdly , it is known since the studies by kazantsev @xcite that small  scale dynamos may work without kinetic helicity .",
    "this fact has meanwhile been confirmed by many other investigations ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "let us return to the mean  field concept but restrict ourselves , for the sake of simplicity , to homogeneous and statistically steady turbulence .",
    "we stay first with the second  order correlation approximation but relax the restriction to the high  conductivity limit .",
    "as is known from early studies , e.g. @xcite , the crucial parameter for the @xmath0effect is then no longer the mean kinetic helicity @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0-effect is in general determined by the function @xmath10 or , what is equivalent , by the kinetic helicity spectrum , defined as its fourier transform with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the high  conductivity limit this brings us back to the above  mentioned results . in the low conductivity limit ,",
    "that is , large correlation times in comparison to the magnetic  field decay time for a turbulent eddy , the @xmath0effect is closely connected with the quantity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the vector potential of @xmath2 , that is @xmath15 with @xmath16 . for isotropic turbulence",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 is then equal to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 means the magnetic diffusivity of the fluid @xcite . in the anisotropic case the trace of",
    "the @xmath0tensor is again equal to three times this value of @xmath0 . in general @xmath9",
    "does not vanish in this limit but it is without interest for the @xmath0effect . both @xmath9 and @xmath13 are quantities , which , if non",
    " zero , indicate deviations of the turbulence from reflectional symmetry . in the second  order correlation approximation the @xmath8effect , too ,",
    "is completely determined by the kinetic helicity spectrum @xcite .    beyond the second  order correlation approximation",
    "the @xmath0effect is no longer determined by the kinetic helicity spectrum alone . in an example given by gilbert et al .",
    "@xcite an @xmath0effect ( with zero trace of the @xmath0tensor ) occurs in a non - steady flow even with zero kinetic helicity spectrum .",
    "note that small - scale dynamos may also work with zero kinetic helicity spectrum , but they do not produce large scale fields .",
    "interesting simple dynamo models have been proposed by g.  o.  roberts @xcite . in his second paper",
    "@xcite he considered dynamos due to steady fluid flows which are periodic in two cartesian coordinates , say @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but independent of the third one , @xmath21 . when speaking of a  roberts dynamo \" in what follows we refer always to the first flow pattern envisaged there [ equation ( 5.1 ) , figure 1 ] .",
    "this dynamo played a central role in designing the karlsruhe dynamo experiment @xcite .",
    "it can be easily interpreted within the mean  field concept . in that sense",
    "it occurs as an @xmath0effect dynamo with an anisotropic @xmath0-effect .",
    "the flow pattern proposed by roberts , and in a sense realized in the experiment , shows non  zero kinetic helicity . in this paper",
    "we want to demonstrate that this kind of dynamo works also with a slightly modified flow pattern in which the kinetic helicity is exactly equal to zero everywhere ( but the kinetic helicity spectrum remains non ",
    "zero ) .    in section",
    "ii we present a simple mean ",
    "field theory of roberts dynamos at the level of the second  order correlation approximation . in section iii",
    "we report on numerical results that apply independently of this approximation . finally , in section",
    "iv some conclusions are discussed .",
    "we focus our attention now on the roberts dynamo in the above sense and refer again to a cartesian coordinate system @xmath22 .",
    "the fluid is considered as incompressible .",
    "therefore its velocity , @xmath2 , has to satisfy @xmath23 , and it is assumed to be a sum of two parts , one proportional to @xmath24 and the other to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the unit vector in @xmath21 direction , and @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding flow pattern is depicted in figure [ robflow ] .",
    "we denote the sections defined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 with integer @xmath30 and @xmath31 as  cells \" . in that sense the velocity @xmath2 changes sign when we proceed from one cell to an adjacent one .",
    "a fluid flow of that kind acts indeed as a dynamo .",
    "magnetic field modes with the same periodicity in @xmath19 and @xmath20 varying however with @xmath21 like @xmath32 or @xmath33 may grow for sufficiently small values of @xmath34 .",
    "the most easily excitable modes for a given @xmath35 possess a part which is independent of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but varies with @xmath21 .",
    "let us proceed to more general flow patterns which show some of the crucial properties of the specific flow pattern considered so far .",
    "we assume again that the flow is incompressible , steady , depends periodically on @xmath19 and @xmath20 but is independent of @xmath21 , and that it shows a cell structure as in the example above .",
    "more precisely we require that @xmath2 changes sign if the pattern is shifted by a length @xmath36 along the @xmath19 or @xmath20 axes or is rotated by @xmath37 about the @xmath21 axis .",
    "let us sketch the mean  field theory of dynamos working with fluid flows of this type ( partially using ideas described in our paper @xcite , in the following referred to as rb03 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field @xmath38 is governed by the induction equation @xmath39 with the magnetic diffusivity @xmath18 being constant .",
    "we define mean fields by averaging the original fields over a square that corresponds to four cells in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "more precisely we define the mean field @xmath41 , which belongs to an original field @xmath42 , in any given point @xmath43 by averaging @xmath42 over the square defined by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "if applied to quantities which are periodic in @xmath19 and @xmath20 with a period length @xmath46 this average satisfies the reynolds rules .",
    "clearly we have @xmath47 .",
    "when taking the average of equation ( [ eq01 ] ) and denoting @xmath48 by @xmath49 we obtain the mean  field induction equation @xmath50 with the mean electromotive force @xmath51 for the determination of @xmath52 for a given @xmath2 the equation for @xmath49 is of interest .",
    "this equation follows from ( [ eq01 ] ) and ( [ eq03 ] ) , @xmath53 where @xmath54 stands for @xmath55 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider here only the steady case .",
    "we introduce a fourier transformation with respect to @xmath21 , that is , represent any function @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath56 is real , we have @xmath58 , where the asterisk means complex conjugation .",
    "we have now @xmath59 transforming ( [ eq07 ] ) accordingly we obtain @xmath60 we further suppose that @xmath61 is independent of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that @xmath62 is independent of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , too .",
    "it is then obvious that the connection between @xmath62 and @xmath61 must have the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is , like @xmath62 and @xmath61 , independent of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but depends on @xmath35 . because @xmath65 and @xmath66 it has also to satisfy @xmath67 .",
    "clearly @xmath64 is determined by @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath52 does not change under inverting the sign of @xmath2 , and a @xmath37 rotation of the @xmath2 field about the @xmath21 axis changes nothing else than its sign , the components of the tensor @xmath64 have to be invariant under @xmath37 rotations of the coordinate system about the @xmath21 axis .",
    "we may therefore conclude that @xmath68 with real @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "together with ( [ eq11 ] ) this leads to @xmath72 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath73 is equal to the average of @xmath74 , and we may conclude from ( [ eq09 ] ) that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are independent of @xmath77 .",
    "this implies @xmath78 .",
    "we may then write @xmath79 with two real quantities @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which are even functions of @xmath35 . from ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) we obtain @xmath82 this relation is discussed in some detail in rb03 , section v b.    we now restrict our attention to the limit of small @xmath35 , that is , small variations of @xmath83 with @xmath21 . then @xmath80 and @xmath81 lose their dependence on @xmath35 . denoting them by @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "we conclude from ( [ eq15 ] ) that @xmath86    equation ( [ eq03 ] ) together with ( [ eq17 ] ) allow solutions of the form @xmath87 $ ] with @xmath88 .",
    "growing solutions are possible if @xmath89 we note that , in agreement with the anti  dynamo theorem by zeldovich , @xmath90 vanishes if @xmath91 , that is , if @xmath83 loses its dependence on @xmath21 .      for the determination of the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 we restrict ourselves to an approximation which corresponds to the second  order correlation approximation .",
    "it is defined by the neglect of @xmath54 in ( [ eq07 ] ) , or @xmath92 in ( [ eq09 ] ) . in view of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which correspond to the limit of small @xmath35 , we expand @xmath93 and @xmath61 in powers of @xmath35 but neglect all contributions with higher than first powers of @xmath35 .",
    "that is , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where of course @xmath96 and @xmath97 . from ( [ eq09 ] ) follows then @xmath98 we put now @xmath99 , where @xmath14 denotes a vector potential satisfying @xmath16 , further @xmath100 with @xmath101 , which implies @xmath102 from ( [ eq21 ] ) with @xmath2 expressed in this way we conclude @xmath103 \\ , .",

    "this yields @xmath116 the result for @xmath84 can also be written in the form @xmath117 in agreement with our remarks in the introduction the @xmath0effect is not determined by the average of the kinetic helicity @xmath9 but by the related but different quantity @xmath13 , that is , some kind of mean helicity of the vector potential @xmath14 .",
    "we elaborate now on the above result for @xmath84 for flow patterns similar to those which have been considered in the context of the karlsruhe dynamo experiment @xcite . to define the flow first in a single cell like those depicted in figure [ cell ]",
    "we introduce a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath118 with @xmath119 in the middle of this cell and @xmath21 as in the cartesian system used above .",

    "for @xmath13 it is important that the part of the vector potential @xmath14 resulting from the flow in the region @xmath125 of a given cell does not vanish in @xmath126 , and likewise the part resulting from the flow in @xmath126 does not vanish in @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , the parts of @xmath14 resulting from flows in other cells have to be taken into account . considering these aspects",
    "we may conclude that @xmath137 with non  zero quantities @xmath138 and @xmath139 depending on @xmath140 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , @xmath13 and , according to ( [ eq35 ] ) , @xmath84 remain in general different from zero if the flow loses its kinetic helicity , that is , as @xmath9 , or @xmath122 , vanish .",
    "this implies the possibility of @xmath0effect dynamos without kinetic helicity .",
    "in our above calculations of @xmath84 and @xmath85 an approximation in the spirit of the second  order correlation approximation has been used .",
    "the results are reliable only if a suitably defined magnetic reynolds number is much smaller than unity .",
    "this can also be expressed by requiring that the normalized flow rates @xmath141 and @xmath142 show this property .",
    "in addition we have assumed weak variations of the mean magnetic field in the @xmath21direction , more precisely @xmath143 .    in order to confirm the existence of @xmath0effect dynamos without kinetic helicity in an independent way and to check whether it occurs only under the mentioned conditions or over a wider range of parameters , equation ( [ eq01 ] ) with the flow defined by ( [ eq41 ] ) has been solved numerically .",

    "for case ( i ) a non - zero kinetic helicity was chosen , for the cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) zero kinetic helicity .",
    "the marginal modes turned out to be non  oscillatory .",
    "note that the parameters for case ( i ) , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , are realistic values in view of the karlsruhe dynamo device . in the cases ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) the regions @xmath125 and @xmath126 have a common surface . in order to make sure that there is no effect of an artificial kinetic helicity due to the restricted numerical resolution at this surface , in case ( iii ) a clear separation of these two regions was considered .",
    "as long as the kinetic helicity in @xmath126 does not vanish , that is @xmath155 , the dynamo works even with @xmath156 , that is zero flow in @xmath125 . in the absence of kinetic helicity , @xmath157 , the dynamos works , too , as long as @xmath128 and therefore @xmath13 are different from zero .",
    "however , the dynamo disappears if , in addition to @xmath122 , also @xmath128 and so @xmath13 vanish .",
    "this is plausible since then choices of the coordinate origin @xmath158 are possible such that @xmath159 and @xmath160 coincide . in this case , usually referred to as  parity  invariant \" , any @xmath0effect can be excluded .",
    "the dissipation of the mean magnetic field grows with @xmath149 . by this reason the dynamo threshold grows with @xmath149 , too .",
    "we have examined a modified version of the roberts dynamo with a steady fluid flow as it was considered in the context of the dynamo experiment . by contrast to",
    "what might be suggested by simple explanations of this dynamo the necessary deviation of the flow from reflectional symmetry is not adequately described by the kinetic helicity @xmath1 of the fluid flow or its average @xmath9 .",
    "dynamo action with steady fluid flow requires in truth a deviation which is indicated by a non ",
    "zero value of the quantity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the vector potential of @xmath2 .",
    "even if the kinetic helicity is equal to zero everywhere , dynamo action occurs if only the quantity @xmath13 , the helicity of the vector potential of the flow , is unequal to zero .",
    "this fact is not surprising in light of the general findings of mean  field electrodynamics .",
    "we stress that our result does not mean that the quantity @xmath13 is in general more fundamental for the @xmath0effect and its dynamo action than @xmath9 . in cases with steady fluid flow",
    "indeed @xmath13 is crucial .",
    "however , with flows varying rapidly in time , the crucial quantity is @xmath9 .",
    "both the mean kinetic helicity @xmath9 and the quantity @xmath13 are determined by the helicity spectrum of the flow .",
    "that is , the roberts dynamo does not work with zero kinetic helicity spectrum . in this sense",
    "the situation is different from that in the interesting example of an @xmath0effect dynamo given by gilbert et al .",
    "@xcite , which works with a very special non  steady flow for which the kinetic helicity spectrum is indeed zero .",
    "looking back at the karlsruhe experiment we may state that a modified ( technically perhaps more complex ) version without kinetic helicity of the fluid flow should show the dynamo effect , too .",
    "as table  [ tab1 ] exemplifies , however , the kinetic helicity can well reduce the dynamo threshold . in that sense",
    "we may modify the title of the paper of gilbert et al .  and say : helicity is unnecessary _ for roberts dynamos _  but it helps !    *",
