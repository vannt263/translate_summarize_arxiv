    "in classical ( monotonic ) logic , if a conclusion @xmath1 follows from some premises , then @xmath1 also follows when the set of premises is enlarged ; that is , adding premises never invalidates any conclusions .",
    "in contrast , in ( nonmonotonic ) commonsense reasoning we are typically in a situation of partial knowledge , and a conclusion reached from a set of premises may be retracted when some premises are added .",
    "nonmonotonic reasoning is a relevant topic in the field of artificial intelligence , and has been studied in literature by many symbolic and numerical formalisms ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a remarkable theory related to nonmonotonic reasoning has been proposed by adams in his probabilistic logic of conditionals ( @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that the approach of adams can be developed with full generality by exploiting coherence - based probabilistic reasoning ( @xcite ) . in the setting of coherence conditional probabilities can be directly assigned , and _ zero probabilities for conditioning events _ can be properly managed ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the coherence - based approach is applied in many fields : statistical analysis , decision theory , probabilistic default reasoning and fuzzy theory .",
    "it allows one to manage incomplete probabilistic assignments in a situation of vague or partial knowledge ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a basic notion in the work of adams is the quasi conjunction of conditionals .",
    "this logical operation also plays a relevant role in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where a suitable quasi and rule is introduced to characterize entailment from a knowledge base . in the present article , besides quasi conjunction , we study by duality the quasi disjunction of conditional events and the associated quasi or rule . + theoretical tools which play a relevant role in artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic are t - norms and t - conorms .",
    "these allow one to extend the boolean operations of conjunction and disjunction to the setting of multi - valued logics .",
    "t - norms ( first proposed in @xcite ) and t - conorms were introduced in @xcite and are a subclass of aggregation functions ( @xcite ) .",
    "they play a basic role in decision theory , information and data fusion , probability theory and risk management .",
    "+ in this paper we give many insights about probabilistic default reasoning in the setting of coherence , by making a probabilistic analysis of the quasi and , quasi or and loop inference rules .",
    "some results were already given without proof in @xcite .",
    "to begin , we recall some basic notions and results regarding coherence , probabilistic default reasoning , and the hamacher t - norm / t - conorm ( section 2 ) . then , we show that some well known t - norms and t - conorms appear as lower and upper bounds when we propagate probability assessments on a finite family of conditional events to the associated quasi conjunction . by these bounds",
    "we obtain the quasi and rule .",
    "we also consider special cases of logical dependencies associated with the goodman - nguyen inclusion relation ( @xcite ) and with the compound probability theorem .",
    "then , we give two results which identify the strict relationship holding among coherence , the goodman - nguyen inclusion relation , and p - entailment ( section 3 ) .",
    "we deepen a further aspect of the quasi and rule by determining the probability bounds on the premises from given bounds on the conclusion of the rule ( section 4 ) . by exploiting duality",
    ", we give analogous results for the quasi disjunction of conditional events , and we obtain the quasi or rule . we also examine the or rule , and we show that quasi conjunction and quasi disjunction of the premises of this rule both coincide with its conclusion ( section 5 ) . in a similar way , we then enrich the quasi or rule by determining the probability bounds on the premises from given bounds on the conclusion of the rule ( section 6 ) .",
    "we consider biconditional events , and we introduce the notion of an @xmath0-conditional event , by means of which we give a probabilistic semantics to a _ generalized loop rule _ ( section 7 ) .",
    "finally , we give some conclusions and perspectives on future work ( section 8) .",
    "we illustrate notions and results with a table and some figures .",
    "+ the results given in this work may be useful for the treatment of uncertainty in many applications of statistics and artificial intelligence , in particular for the probabilistic approach to inference rules in nonmonotonic reasoning , for the psychology of uncertain reasoning , and for probabilistic reasoning in the semantic web ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we first discuss some basic notions regarding coherence . then , we recall the notions of p - consistency and p - entailment of adams ( @xcite ) within the setting of coherence .      as in the approach of de finetti , events represent uncertain facts described by ( non ambiguous ) logical propositions .",
