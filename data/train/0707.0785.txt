    "the purpose of this paper is to study some possible connections between the classes of garside monoids and divisibility monoids , which are natural algebraic generalizations of monoids involved in two mathematical areas , namely braid theory and trace theory , respectively .",

    "generalizing mazurkiewicz trace monoids , divisibility monoids have been introduced as a mathematical model for the sequential behavior of some concurrent systems considered in several areas in computer science and in which two sequential transformations of the form  @xmath0 and  @xmath1with  @xmath2 viewed as atomic transitions  can give rise to the same effect .    here",
    "we show that garside monoids and divisibility monoids are both strangely similar ( although they come from apparently unrelated mathematical theories ) and genuinely different ( even if they share some essential algebraic properties )",
    ". their similarity will be illustrated by the fact that their quasi - center  roughly speaking , some supmonoid of the center  can be studied with close techniques and described through a same statement .",
    "their particularity will be emphasized by the fact that the intersection between the two classes  that we exhibit by using the result about the quasi - center  is reduced to a somewhat confined subclass .",

    "we compare these results with those obtained for garside monoids in  @xcite . in section  3 , we finally prove the main theorem of this paper ( theorem  [ t : intersection ] ) and illustrate  it .",
    "in this section , we list some basic properties of garside monoids and divisibility monoids , and summarize results by dehornoy & paris about garside monoids and by droste &  kuske about divisibility monoids . for all the results quoted here , we refer the reader to  @xcite and to  @xcite .",

    "then  @xmath199 is a free abelian submonoid of  @xmath3 , and the partial function  @xmath200 is a partial surjective semilattice homomorphism from  @xmath201 onto  @xmath202 .    let  @xmath28 be the set of the irreducible elements in  @xmath3 . by proposition  [ p : minimal ] , @xmath203 is the minimal generating set of  @xmath199 .",
    "so , in order to prove that  @xmath199 is free abelian , it suffices to show that , for any two  @xmath168 in  @xmath28 admitting local delta with  @xmath204 , the element  @xmath205which exists by lemma  [ l : zdoflcms]is  @xmath206 .",

    "the corresponding proofs however are different , even though the current approach closely follows  @xcite .",
    "the point is that , in the garside case , the function  @xmath139 is total and coincide with its left counterpart  @xmath208 , but there need not exist an additive length ( see for instance the monoid  @xmath45 in example  [ e : garside ] ) , while , in the divisibility case , there exists an additive length but the function  @xmath139 is only partial and does not admit a left counterpart in general .",
    "we can finally state  :        \\(i ) the condition is necessary by very definition of a garside monoid .",

    "therefore , by lemma  [ l : key ] , @xmath116 exists for every  @xmath7 in  @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , @xmath209 exists for every irreducible element  @xmath58 of  @xmath3 .",
    "finally , by proposition  [ p : freeabelian ] , @xmath210 is a minimal garside element for  @xmath3 , thus  @xmath3 is a garside monoid .",

    "then the finite lattice of its simple elements  @xmath211 is distributive . by proposition  [ p : freeabelian ] , we have  @xmath212 .",
    "now , by theorem  [ t : kuske ]  ( _ iv _ ) , for every  @xmath58 in  @xmath28 , @xmath213 is a subset of  @xmath89 including  @xmath58 , say  @xmath214 , so we have  @xmath215 , hence  @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , the lattice  @xmath211 is a finite distributive lattice , whose upper bound is the join of its atoms , so  @xmath211 is a hypercube ( see  @xcite or for instance  @xcite ) .",

    "then , for every positive integer  @xmath219 , @xmath227 is isomorphic to  @xmath228 with  @xmath229 the rank  @xmath219 chain , which is a distributive lattice .",
    "now , for every element  @xmath7 in  @xmath3 , the lattice  @xmath62 is a sublattice of a lattice  @xmath227 for some positive integer  @xmath219 .",
    "every sublattice of a distributive lattice being distributive , the lattice  @xmath62 is thus distributive for every element  @xmath7 in  @xmath3 .",
