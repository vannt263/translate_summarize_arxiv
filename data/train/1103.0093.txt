    "lie algebras and poisson algebras have played an extremely important role in mathematics and physics for a long time .",

    ", it has recently been shown that the differential geometry of @xmath1-dimensional riemannian submanifolds can be described in terms of an @xmath1-ary nambu algebra structure on the space of smooth functions on the manifold @xcite .",
    "a long - standing problem related to nambu algebras is their quantization . for poisson algebras ,",
    "the problem of finding an operator algebra where the commutator lie algebra corresponds to the poisson algebra is a well - studied problem , e.g. in the context of matrix regularizations @xcite . for",
    "higher order algebras much less is known and the corresponding problem seems to be difficult to study .",
    "a nambu - lie algebra is defined in general by an @xmath1-ary multilinear multiplication which is skew - symmetric and satisfies an identity extending the jacobi identity for the lie algebras . for @xmath4",
    "this identity is @xmath5 =    [ [ x_1,x_2,x_3 ] , x_{4},x_{5 } ]    + [ x_3 , [ x_1,x_2,x_{4 } ] , x_{5}]+    [ x_3,x_{4},[x_1,x_2,x_{5 } ] ] .    \\ ] ] in nambu - lie algebras , the additional freedom in comparison with lie algebras is mainly limited to extra arguments in the multilinear multiplication .",
    "the identities of nambu - lie algebras are also closely resembling the identities for lie algebras . as a result",
    ", there is a close similarity between lie algebras and nambu - lie algebras in their appearances in connection to other algebraic and analytic structures and in the extent of their applicability .",
    "thus it is not surprising that it becomes unclear how to associate in meaningful ways ordinary nambu - lie algebras with the important in physics generalizations and quantum deformations of lie algebras when typically the ordinary skew - symmetry and jacobi identities of lie algebras are violated . however ,",
    "if the class of nambu - lie algebras is extended with enough extra structure beyond just adding more arguments in multilinear multiplication , the natural ways of association of such multilinear algebraic structures with generalizations and quantum deformations of lie algebras may become feasible .",
    "hom - nambu - lie algebras are defined by a similar but more general identity than that of nambu - lie algebras involving some additional linear maps . these linear maps",
    "twisting or deforming the main identities introduce substantial new freedom in the structure allowing to consider hom - nambu - lie algebras as deformations of nambu - lie algebras ( @xmath1-lie algebras ) .",
    "the extra freedom built into the structure of hom - nambu - lie algebras may provide a path to quantization beyond what is possible for ordinary nambu - lie algebras .",
    "all this gives also important motivation for investigation of mathematical concepts and structures such as leibniz @xmath1-ary algebras @xcite and their modifications and extensions , as well as hom - algebra extensions of poisson algebras @xcite .",
    "for discussion of physical applications of these and related algebraic structures to models for elementary particles , and unification problems for interactions see @xcite .",
    "the general hom - algebra structures arose first in connection to quasi - deformation and discretizations of lie algebras of vector fields @xcite .",
    "these quasi - deformations lead to quasi - lie algebras , quasi - hom - lie algebras and hom - lie algebras , which are generalized lie algebra structures with twisted skew - symmetry and jacobi conditions .",
    "the first motivating examples in physics and mathematics literature are @xmath6-deformations of the witt and virasoro algebras constructed in the investigations of vertex models in conformal field theory @xcite . motivated by these and new examples arising as applications of the general quasi - deformation construction of @xcite on the one hand , and the desire to be able to treat within the same framework such well - known generalizations of lie algebras as the color and super lie algebras on the other hand , quasi - lie algebras and subclasses of quasi - hom - lie algebras and hom - lie algebras were introduced in @xcite . in hom - lie algebras ,",
    "skew - symmetry is untwisted , whereas the jacobi identity is twisted by a single linear map and contains three terms as for lie algebras , reducing to the jacobi identity for ordinary lie algebras when the linear twisting map is the identity map .    in this paper",
