    "quantum mechanical manifestations of dynamical properties of a system which classically possesses a chaotic character have been intensively studied@xcite .",
    "level statistics which has a long history in nuclear physics as described by the random - matrix theory@xcite is now a favorable playground in the discussion of a transition from a regular ( integrable ) to a chaotic character of a quantum system .",
    "together with numerical studies on model systems , analytic investigation has been made based on semiclassical trace formula@xcite .",
    "wave functions of a system which is classically chaotic have also been investigated : statistical theory predicts that the amplitude distributions show the porter - thomas distribution@xcite , which was then numerically demonstrated to hold for model chaotic systems .",
    "contrary to the naive expectation , however , the profile of the wave function for a chaotic system is not entirely structureless : for instance , the husimi representation of a wave function in the chaotic regime frequently suffers from a _ scar _ of classical periodic orbits@xcite .",
    "although a considerable progress has since been made , it is still an important issue to clarify the characteristic of eigenstates and its matrix elements for systems which are classically irregular or chaotic .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study another aspect of the wave functions for a system which shows a transition from an integrable to a chaotic character : we study response functions of the system , i.e. transition matrix elements as a function of energy .",
    "statistical properties of the distribution of transition matrix elements have been studied@xcite , and it was shown , in particular , that the distribution becomes a porter - thomas type for chaotic systems .",
    "the approach proposed in ref.@xcite has since been developed to elucidate the role of periodic orbits and was extended to various systems including the response of mesoscopic systems to realistic probes@xcite .",
    "these studies are based on the semiclassical framework , and focus mainly on the responses to long - wavelength probes .",
    "semiclassical studies of response functions have also been done in a different framework@xcite , which concentrate on their smooth behavior but not much on fluctuations .    in this paper , we study a model system using a large space diagonalization and calculating response functions for the operators which probe the system with a variable wavelength , or momentum transfer . in particular , we put an emphasis on which aspect of the response function reflects the regular or the chaotic character of the system .",
    "we also would like to study a structure in the response function for a system in a chaotic regime which however is not expected to occur in the statistical random - matrix theory .",
    "although we are here concerned with the properties of response functions which show up in a model system , they will also be interesting in realistic applications , as this response is similar to the excitation cross section for , e.g. , electron scattering in the plane - wave born approximation .",
    "thus it is hoped that the present study may provide insight into the understanding of collective states such as nuclear giant resonances embedded in complicated many - particle many - hole states as studied in nuclear reactions .",
    "the main content of the paper is as follows : in the next section we summarize classical and quantum mechanical properties of the model hamiltonian and fix values of the relevant parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : response ] we study response functions first for a long wavelength probe , and then for the probe characterized by a given momentum transfer .",
    "we study the fluctuation properties of the response functions , concentrating especially on the similarity or the difference for the regular and the chaotic systems .",
    "the accuracy of the calculation has been checked against sum rules .",
    "final section is devoted to a summary .",
    "in order to study the response functions for a system which is capable of showing regular as well as chaotic properties , we adopt the following hamiltonian as a model , @xmath0 this model hamiltonian has been adopted by a number of authors for the studies of level statistics or wave functions@xcite . it was also employed as a model for a background system in the studies of the fluctuation properties of strength functions.@xcite let us first briefly summarize classical properties of the model , which have been studied in detail by meyer@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) possesses a dynamical scaling property in the sense that the classical phase space structure at one energy is mapped into another by a simple scaling of the coordinates and momenta .",
    "it has a high symmetry called @xmath1 : the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to a reflection about @xmath2-axis , @xmath3-axis , and also about the line @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , by rotating 45@xmath5 in the @xmath6 plane , the hamiltonian is mapped into the one with a coupling constant @xmath7 . as the system becomes unbounded from below for @xmath8 , we have only to consider the range @xmath9 $ ] for the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "meyer@xcite showed that for large @xmath10 values ( @xmath11 ) the classical phase space structure is almost completely chaotic , while for small @xmath10 the system becomes regular . in the following calculations we adopt two typical values of the parameter : @xmath120.2 and 0.6 .",
    "they correspond to quasiintegrable and fully chaotic systems , respectively .",
    "for instance , for @xmath13 a single trajectory fills up almost 90% of the available phase space , while for @xmath14 the fraction of the phase space covered by irregular orbits is only 25% in typical cases@xcite .    to study quantum mechanical properties of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we follow the procedure essentially of zimmerman et al.@xcite :",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized within a truncated model space spanned by a set of suitable harmonic oscillator bases @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denote the numbers of oscillator quanta in the @xmath2- and @xmath3-directions . in the following",
    "we take the unit @xmath17 .",
    "the frequency @xmath18 of the harmonic oscillator basis is determined so as to minimize @xmath19 in the adopted model space .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath18 are 7.51(@xmath14 ) and 7.13(@xmath13 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix can be decomposed into submatrices due to the @xmath1 symmetry . as in ref.@xcite",
    "we take up four classes of the one - dimensional representation which are labeled as @xmath20 according to their symmetry properties under reflection on the axes and diagonals in the @xmath6 plane @xcite .",
    "( for instance , @xmath21 is symmetric under both reflections . )",
    "the model space is spanned by the bases with @xmath22 , which gives the dimension of each submatrices as 5776 , 5625 , 5700 , 5700 .",
    "the diagonalization has been performed for each submatrices .",
    "study of the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution confirms the character of the system suggested by the classical phase space structures , i.e. , the poisson like distribution for @xmath14 and the wigner distribution for @xmath13 within each symmetry class .",
    "we also confirmed that the amplitude distribution of the wave functions for @xmath10=0.6 show the porter - thomas distribution except for a singular peak at zero .    in the following the results of the calculation will be shown for the states which belong to the symmetry class @xmath21 .",
    "the results are similar for other symmetry classes .",
    "the basis state @xmath23 belonging to the class @xmath21 is written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are even integers and @xmath27 .",
    "because of the selection rule , the relevant part of the operator which contributes to the matrix element of the response should have the definite symmetry property .",
    "it should be noted that among the 5776 wave functions of the class @xmath21 , those having very large energies are not quite reliable because of the limitation in the basis states .",
    "this is especially so when the response functions with large momentum transfer @xmath28 are concerned .",
    "we may make an estimate for the range of validity by comparing the obtained level density with the semiclassical one .",
    "the comparison suggests that the maximum reliable energy to be @xmath29 depending on the values of the parameter @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this maximum energy is contrasted with the largest energy eigenvalue @xmath30 obtained by the diagonalization .",
    "this limits the maximum value of the momentum transfer of the probe adopted below to be around @xmath31 , where the corresponding quasielastic peak lies around @xmath32 .",
    "this is confirmed by the calculation as shown later .",
    "we consider the response functions defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes a probing operator which connects the initial and the final eigenstates @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in many cases of interest , the initial state @xmath35",
    "is set to the ground state of the system @xmath37 which belongs to the @xmath21 symmetry class , in which case the index @xmath38 is dropped .",
    "the response function shows the distribution of the state @xmath39 over the energy eigenstates @xmath40 .",
    "if , for instance , the initial state @xmath35 has a simple structure as in the ground state of the harmonic oscillator , the state @xmath39 and the response function will simply reflect the structure of the probe operator @xmath34 .",
    "we consider operators depending only on a single variable , say @xmath41 , to see how the irregular behavior of the wave functions controlled by the parameter @xmath10 may be reflected in the response function .",
    "one may rewrite the response function ( [ response ] ) in the form of the time - correlation function @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 denotes the expectation value in the initial state @xmath35 .",
    "the probe @xmath34 is written as a function of the operator @xmath45 which is the solution of the heisenberg equation of motion . in eq.([operator ] ) we show also a short time expansion in terms of the operators at @xmath46 , e.g. , @xmath47 . a corresponding semiclassical expression for eq .  ( [ timecorr ] )",
    "has been fully utilized in the analysis of refs.@xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the universal behavior of a dynamical system , i.e. , if it is regular or chaotic , emerges in the fluctuation properties of the matrix elements of the operators , while their expectation values are strongly dependent on the specific dynamics of the system .",
    "although the transition matrix elements for a chaotic system are known to generically follow the porter - thomas distribution , the energy - strength correlation such as the one contained in response functions is certainly dependent on the specific properties of the dynamics governed by the hamiltonian . in this latter respect we note that the shape of the response function versus energy is constrained by a number of sum rules@xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath48 for a given operator @xmath34 .",
    "the integer @xmath49 may in general take negative values ( usually for @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , in which case the sum rule corresponds to the generalized susceptibility of the system . by increasing the value of @xmath49 and subtracting the lower moments , e.g. , in the form of the shifted moment or of the cumulant",
    ", one can regain finer and finer structure of the response function .",
    "although one may recover the response functions by mellin - transforming the sum rule values , the use of sum rules lies in the fact that in some cases the sum becomes a simple matrix element in the initial state .",
    "the latter may be calculated precisely and serves as a check for the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "the low @xmath49 sum rules , in particular , sometimes become insensitive to the detailed dynamics and constrain the gross behavior of the response functions .    as a probe @xmath34 of the response",
    "we first consider the operator @xmath52 with an arbitrary initial state @xmath35 .",
    "we then fix @xmath53 and adopt the operator @xmath54 which is closely related to an excitation of the system by an external probe characterized by momentum transfer @xmath28 ( and length scale @xmath55 ) . the operator @xmath52 may be regarded as a long wavelength part of @xmath56 , and is similar to the @xmath57 operator of electromagnetic transitions . by changing the value of @xmath28 in @xmath56 , one can study in principle long as well as short distance structure of the matrix elements .    in the actual calculation",
    "we consider only the operators symmetric under the reflection about @xmath2- and @xmath3-axes and also about the line @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath58 where the arguments are explicitly written to show the dependence on the coordinates .",
    "for the initial state @xmath35 in the class @xmath21 this implies that in eq .",
    "( [ response ] ) only the states @xmath59 belonging to the @xmath21 symmetry class contribute .",
    "we first study the response function for the @xmath52 probe .",
    "a typical example of the response to this probe is given in fig.[respx ] .",
    "here we show the response @xmath60 for the @xmath61=500th initial state as a function of the energy @xmath62 for @xmath120.2 and 0.6 . for other initial states",
    "the main features are similar .",
    "we immediately see that the response consists of three clusters of strengths for both @xmath10=0.2 and 0.6 : largest strength lies at @xmath63 with almost no other strength close to this peak , while two other clusters are located around @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is slightly less than @xmath66 , the expected value for a simple harmonic oscillator . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the strengths are concentrated on a few states , while strengths are distributed over some energy range for @xmath13 .",
    "we now introduce creation and annihilation operators @xmath67 , etc .",
    ", of the oscillator quanta with frequency @xmath18 , and decompose the operator @xmath68 as @xmath69 one may then be tempted to assign the @xmath63 peak to the response to the operator @xmath70 , and two other clusters around @xmath64 to the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ resd0d2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the response to the operator @xmath70 for @xmath14 and 0.6 , respectively .",
    "although the state @xmath73 is not proportional to @xmath35 , the fragmentation of the strength is restricted to only a few states in both cases .",
    "more important is the mixing in the state @xmath74 .",
    "figure  [ resd0d2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) show the response to the operator @xmath71 for the @xmath75th state .",
    "the distribution of strengths is considerably different between @xmath14 and @xmath13 cases .",
    "strengths for @xmath14 are seen to concentrate on a few states , while those for @xmath13 are distributed over many states .",
    "the above features may be quantified by studying the number of principal components ( npc ) .",
    "the npc for a normalized state @xmath76 in terms of a complete set of orthonormalized states @xmath40 is defined as : @xmath77 the npc becomes unity when the strengths are concentrated in a single eigenstate , while becomes @xmath78 when the strengths are equally distributed over the whole @xmath78 eigenstates .",
    "figure  [ d0npc ] shows the npc of the state @xmath73 ( with a suitable normalization ) for each eigenstate @xmath35 as a function of @xmath79 , where the set @xmath40 has been taken to be the eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "the npc takes values @xmath80 in most cases and decreases as the energy increases .",
    "general trend is not much different for @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the situation is drastically different if we study the npc for the state @xmath74 ( again normalized ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ d2npc ] . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the npc remains small and does not show a marked energy dependence , while for @xmath13 , the npc shows a rapid increase as a function of energy and takes a quite large value .",
    "we thus find that the @xmath81 part of the operator @xmath68 is sensitive(insensitive ) to the characteristic changes in the dynamics governed by the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "there is another measure to see the difference between the two cases , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , which can be obtained from the response function associated with @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ strength ] the fraction of strengths ( omitting the one for @xmath63 ) exhausted by two major states carrying largest strengths for each initial state @xmath35 is plotted against @xmath79 . for @xmath10=0.2",
    "more than 60% of the total strengths is exhausted by the two major states and the distribution of the fraction is almost independent of the initial energy @xmath79 , while for @xmath13 they carry less than 50% and this fraction decreases as a function of the initial state energy .",
    "since the dominant part of the strength associated with the operator @xmath70 is contained in the initial state @xmath35 and is omitted here , fig .",
    "[ strength ] shows the characteristics for the response to the operator @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 ) in accordance with the results from npc .",
    "these studies imply that it depends strongly on the choice of the probe whether the difference in the character of the dynamics , namely regular or chaotic , may be easily seen in the response function . in the present case , the difference in the dynamics is not apparent for the probe @xmath82 , while it becomes quite significant for @xmath83 which is a probe , in a sense , orthogonal to the unperturbed oscillator hamiltonian @xmath84 .",
    "the response function for the probe @xmath85 shows both characteristics .",
    "we now consider the response function for @xmath86 .",
    "we fix here the initial state to be the ground state . in this case",
    "the response is closely related to the situation of physical interest such as the inelastic electron scattering from the target in the ground state , where @xmath28 gives the momentum transfer on the target .",
    "the symmetrized probe for @xmath56 is given by @xmath87 .",
    "the response functions @xmath88 ( for @xmath56 ) and @xmath89 ( for @xmath90 ) are calculated in terms of the elementary matrix element @xmath91 for a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator between the states with quanta @xmath49 and @xmath92 , which is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 denotes the associated laguerre polynomial .",
    "the functions @xmath97 are calculated from recursion relations .",
    "we consider several @xmath28 values corresponding to different resolution of the probe , the small @xmath28 limit being related to the long - wavelength probe @xmath52 above . on the other hand , for large @xmath28 values",
    "the operator resolves a fine structure of the system and the main strength of the response lies at high energies . if we use the short - time expansion in eq .",
    "( [ operator ] ) at this high @xmath98 region , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ timecorr ] ) for the probe @xmath56 using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula as @xmath99 where the dots denote operators with higher powers of @xmath100 .",
    "the expression shows that the response is peaked at the quasielastic energy @xmath101 and has a width increasing with @xmath28 and with , e.g. , the momentum spread in the ground state .",
    "this holds precisely for a simple harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , while in general is modified by anharmonicity effects .",
    "the limiting form of response at large @xmath28 has been used to extract momentum distribution of complex system in terms of @xmath102scaling analysis@xcite . in our case , as noted earlier , the model space of diagonalization limits the value of @xmath28 around 50 with the corresponding limit @xmath103 in the resolution of the wave function .",
    "this is much smaller than the length parameter @xmath104 of our oscillator basis . for the quartic oscillator",
    "the length scale will be modified from the simple oscillator value .",
    "one may define the characteristic length scale in the ground state by @xmath105 .",
    "calculated values of @xmath106 are 1.64 for @xmath14 and 1.57 for @xmath13 .",
    "thus the operator at , say @xmath107 , probes already a fairly fine structure of the system compared with the length scale of the ground state . the fact that the state @xmath108 has an oscillation length scale @xmath55 also explains the occurrence of the quasielastic peak : the typical oscillation length scale of the harmonic oscillator wave function at energy @xmath109 is @xmath110 which becomes @xmath103 in the region @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the state @xmath108 will have the largest overlap with the states in the quasielastic region producing a peak in the response .",
    "let us now consider the sum rules .",
    "low @xmath49 values of the sum @xmath112 for the unsymmetrized probe are explicitly calculated to give @xmath113 , etc . , where the last sum rule is obtained from the virial theorem . for the symmetric probe",
    "the sum @xmath114 is not analytically obtained but is given by the expectation values as : @xmath115 it is useful to consider the limiting values for @xmath116 or @xmath117 : @xmath118 where the values at @xmath119 are obtained under the assumption that the wavelength @xmath55 is much smaller than the typical length scale of the ground state wave function .",
    "these values are used to check the accuracy of the calculation within our model space , especially the one at large @xmath28 which requires the matrix elements eq.([qelement ] ) with large @xmath49 .",
    "note that these values are almost independent of @xmath10 , and the numerical calculation confirms that the @xmath10-dependence is small indeed .",
    "it turned out that the limiting values ( [ stilgoinf ] ) for the sum rule are satisfied already at @xmath120 . in view of eq .",
    "( [ stild01 ] ) this result implies that the ground state expectation values of @xmath121 , etc .",
    ", are almost zero , i.e. , the resolution at @xmath120 is already sufficiently fine for the ground state in accordance with the estimate given above . for higher @xmath49 values",
    "the dependence of @xmath122 on @xmath10 is expected to become larger .",
    "thus the gross structure of the response such as the total strength @xmath123 and average energy @xmath124 is rather insensitive to the values of @xmath10 .",
    "detailed structure related to high @xmath49 values of @xmath122 should reflect the dynamics .",
    "figure  [ respq ] shows the response function @xmath89 at @xmath125 10 , 30 and 50 .",
    "the gross structures at a given @xmath28 are similar for both @xmath120.2 and 0.6 , and follow the behavior suggested earlier in this section : not only the central energy follows @xmath126 but the width of the response increases almost linearly with @xmath28",
    ". this should come out exactly from the sum rule if one had employed an unsymmetrized probe @xmath56 .",
    "fine structure of the response , on the other hand , is quite different for the two cases . for @xmath14",
    "the response has a rather simple regular structure : at @xmath12530 , for instance , the response is a superposition of a few structures with different sizes , each of which is centered around @xmath127 and is similar to the response of a harmonic oscillator given by @xmath128 in fact , by inspecting the wave functions one finds that these structures are related to the strong transition matrix elements of uncoupled ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) quartic oscillators which are integrable .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath13 the simple structure disappears and the values of the strength change drastically from one state to the other , although one can still see even at @xmath130 a structure of the regularly spaced spikes as seen for @xmath120.2 .    for chaotic systems",
    "such as represented by random matrix theories , the amplitude distribution of wave functions or the matrix element distribution of an operator is known to follow the porter - thomas distribution .",
    "this may be contrasted to regular systems , where in many cases the quantum number imposes a selection rule of allowed transitions .",
    "our result of response functions is in accordance with this generic behavior as far as the energy - strengths correlation is disregarded . in fig .",
    "[ dist ] we show the strength distribution of the response function for @xmath120.2 and 0.6 at @xmath12530 .",
    "for @xmath120.6 the distribution follows the porter - thomas form given by the dashed line and is quite different from that for @xmath120.2 .",
    "the question then arises : what is the nature of the persisting regular structure in the response functions of fig.[respq ] for @xmath10=0.6 .",
    "this structure becomes more visible if one introduces a normalized response function defined by @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are respectively the response and the level density smoothed over energies . for the smoothing we employed the method of strutinsky@xcite with the smoothing width of 20 .",
    "this normalization procedure removes the gross structure effect of the response as constrained by the low order sum rules and enhances the embedded fine structure@xcite .",
    "figure  [ resnor ] shows the normalized response for @xmath120.2 and 0.6 .",
    "they show that the strengths in the regular spikes for @xmath120.2 are mostly redistributed for @xmath120.6 to produce smaller and smaller strengths to fill up the background , although one can still see the equidistant structure .",
    "the latter may be called an intermediate structure following ref.@xcite .",
    "this energy - strength correlation in the response function has been washed out in the strength distribution .",
    "the presence of an intermediate structure can be detected also in the response correlation function @xmath134 defined by @xmath135 for equidistant structures such as the one for the free response ( [ free ] ) , the correlation function gives again the regular pattern with the same spacing , e.g. , @xmath136 with @xmath95 and @xmath137 of eq.([free ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_corr ] shows the correlation function for the response function at @xmath138 . in the actual calculation we used the normalized response function ( [ wnor ] ) in order to remove the gross shape effect and used the level number displacement @xmath139 instead of the energy displacement @xmath140 .",
    "the resultant correlation function was then smoothed with a smoothing width @xmath141 .",
    "we find the oscillator pattern arising from the intermediate structure in the response function for both @xmath14 and 0.6 .    to understand why there still remains the intermediate structure even in the chaotic case ,",
    "let us investigate the nature of the peak levels in some detail .",
    "we first pick up the peak levels carrying the largest strength among neighboring levels in the response function . for @xmath14 the assignment of peak levels",
    "can be done without difficulty , while for @xmath13 there may be an ambiguity .",
    "the qualitative results of the following analysis are however independent of this ambiguity .",
    "we first studied the npc s of these peak levels in terms of the basis states ( i.e. , @xmath142 in eq.([basis ] ) ) , and found that they are markedly smaller than npc s for other levels .",
    "this implies that the mixing of the basis states in these peak levels is smaller than other states .",
    "the nature of the peak levels may become clear from fig .",
    "[ nx - ny ] , where we plot the quantity @xmath143 here , black points correspond to the peak levels and bars indicate the average values over neighboring levels . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the values of @xmath144 for peak levels are nearly 0.9 , almost twice of those for other levels . for @xmath13 , although it is not so evident as for @xmath14 , the values for peak levels are larger than the average .",
    "these facts strongly indicate that the peak levels are associated with the basis states of the type @xmath145 , although considerably affected by the mixing with other states for @xmath120.6 . in fact , these basis states are the only states excited by the probe @xmath146 for a simple oscillator hamiltonian",
    ".    we may study the above results from the opposite direction . in fig.[lds ] we show the npc of eq.([npc ] ) for the basis state @xmath147 by taking the eigenstates @xmath35 of the hamiltonian for the states @xmath36 in eq.([npc ] ) .",
    "the abscissa is the basis number @xmath148 , and the basis state type @xmath145 is denoted by crosses . for both @xmath10-values",
    "the basis states of the type @xmath145 have the smallest npc values , which shows that these basis states have the smallest spreading width caused by the mixing with other basis states .",
    "thus the fact that there remains an intermediate structure in the response function may be restated in the doorway state picture @xcite : the probe @xmath90 excites first the doorway states @xmath145 which will then mix with other states causing the spreading of the strengths . as the spreading width for these specific states are smaller than the level spacing between the doorway states , the intermediate structure emerges even in the chaotic case .    since the states @xmath145 may correspond to the classical isolated periodic orbits along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axis , the relation between the intermediate structure in the response function and the scar @xcite may be an interesting problem .",
    "suppose that an initial wave packet @xmath149 is located at some point of the closed orbit having the period @xmath150 .",
    "the wave packet will then semiclassically evolve along the closed orbit and will return to the initial position at each time interval @xmath150 . accordingly ,",
    "the overlap of the wave packet at time @xmath100 with the initial wave packet @xmath151 will have peaks at @xmath152 , where @xmath49 is an integer .",
    "the value of these peaks will decay due to the instability of the closed orbit like @xmath153 , where @xmath154 denotes the lyapunov exponent of the closed orbit@xcite .",
    "taking the state @xmath108 as the initial wave packet @xmath155 , the response function is nothing but the fourier transform of the overlap @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , the intermediate structure with peak level spacing @xmath156 and the spreading width of the peaks @xmath157 may emerge in the response function if the condition @xmath158 is satisfied . in the present model ,",
    "the period of the closed orbits along the @xmath2- and @xmath3- axes does not depend on the parameter @xmath10 and is given by @xmath159 at @xmath160 .",
    "numerical calculation also shows that the lyapunov exponents for these closed orbits at @xmath160 are @xmath161 , and 0.92 for @xmath14 and @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath163 are then given by 0.44 and 0.77 for @xmath14 and 0.6 , respectively , both of them being smaller than unity . note that @xmath163 is independent of the energy .",
    "thus , the existence of the intermediate structure may be explained also from the semiclassical point of view .",
    "in this paper we studied properties of the response functions for a coupled quartic oscillator with several probes with a special attention to the difference between the regular and the chaotic cases .    as a first example",
    ", we took the response to the probe @xmath164 .",
    "since the response function is determined by the probe as well as the nature of the wave functions of the system , we must pay attention also to the character of the probe .",
    "for instance , the operators for which the diagonal matrix element becomes a main component are not adequate to see the difference of the dynamics . for the operator @xmath164",
    ", it can be decomposed like eq .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) , and the operator @xmath70 has such a character , while for the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 the non - diagonal matrix elements are important .",
    "therefore , by removing the strengths associated with the operator @xmath70 we can see the difference of the response between the chaotic and the regular cases , namely more spreading of strengths for the chaotic case , which can be quantified with the number of principal components .",
    "next , we considered the response to the probe @xmath165 .",
    "the response function at a given momentum transfer @xmath28 is related to the time - correlation function of the operator with a resolution @xmath55 in the coordinate space .",
    "it was shown that the gross structure of the response function is similar for the chaotic and the regular cases as constrained by global sum rules .",
    "on the other hand , the difference is reflected on the fluctuation , as seen in the strength distribution ( the histogram of strengths ) .",
    "moreover , we detected the intermediate structure ( i.e. , typical energy scales ) even in the chaotic case which can not be expected for the random - matrix model .",
    "we found that the existence of the intermediate structure is due to the fact that the spreading width of the doorway states is smaller than the level spacing of the doorway states , and also indicated its relation to the scar phenomenon .",
    "it would be interesting to study this structure from a different point of view , e.g. , the semiclassical theory of responses @xcite based on the periodic orbits .    in this paper for the sake of simplicity we restricted the discussion to the transitions between the states belonging to the same symmetry class . in the realistic situation , however",
    ", the transition connecting states with different symmetry classes may also occur at same time .",
    "it is well known that the level spacing statistics drastically changes when we consider the levels belonging to different symmetry classes simultaneously .",
    "thus , it is also interesting to see what happens for the response function to the probe connecting different symmetry classes .",
