    "it is the continuation of the fixed target na49 experiment and will study hadron+hadron , hadron+nucleus and nucleus+nucleus collisions .",
    "the na61/shine collaboration consists of 130 physicists from 24 institutions .",
    "shine stands for _ sps heavy ion and neutrino experiment_. the na61/shine physics program includes :    * hadron production measurements for neutrino and cosmic - ray experiments ( not discussed here ( for details see @xcite ) * ion collision program studying the onset of deconfinement , searching for the critical point of strongly interacting matter and investigating high @xmath44 physics",
    "the main component of the na61/shine detector ( fig . [ layout ] ) are four large volume time projections chambers .",
    "the first two ( vtpc-1/2 ) are located in the magnetic field of two superconducting dipole magnets .",
    "the other two ( mtpc - l / r ) are positioned downstream of the magnets .",
    "an additional small gap tpc ( gtpc ) is installed on the beam axis between vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 . behind the tpcs",
    "are three tof - walls .",

    "two other upgrades are planned mainly for the ion beam program .",
    "the first one ( partially installed in 2010 ) is the projectile spectator detector ( psd ) , which will allow precise measurement of the energy of projectile spectators and a reconstruction of the reaction plane .",
    "the determination of the number of projectile spectators is crucial for measurements of event - by - event multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "the psd will allow single nucleon discrimination .",
    "the second upgrade is a he - beam pipe which will reduce @xmath45-electron production by the beam by a factor of 10 .",
    "it will be installed in 2011 .",
    "one of the most important tasks of heavy ion collision physics is to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "theorists expect that for large values of baryon chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) there is a first order phase transition between hadron matter and quark gluon plasma .",
    "in contrast , for small @xmath0 values the transition is expected to be a smooth crossover .",
    "the @xmath46-order phase transition line ends with a critical point of a @xmath47-order phase transition .",
    "one of the main goals of na61/shine is to study the transition line and search for the critical point . to achieve these goals",
    "na61/shine will perform a 2-d scan ( energy and system size ) of the phase diagram ( fig . [ 2dscan ] ) .",
    "the first part of the scan , i.e. collection of p+p collisions was / is done in 2009/2010 . also in 2010 a test of a b beam from fragmentation of pb ions will be performed .",

    "such signals have been observed in the na49 experiment in central pb+pb collisions near @xmath48 gev energy @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ ood ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the structures seen in pb+pb ( au+au ) reactions a smooth behavior is seen for elementary interactions .",
    "na61/shine will check where the evidence of the onset of deconfinement appears for light systems ( b+c , ar+ca , xe+la ) .      the critical point ( cp ) of the phase transition",
    "is predicted to lie in a region of the phase diagram accessible at sps energies @xcite .",
    "enhanced fluctuations in multiplicity and transverse momentum are expected if hadronization and freeze - out happen near the critical point @xcite .",
    "the na49 experiment has already looked for indications of the critical point by studying average @xmath44 ( @xmath49 measure ) and multiplicity fluctuations ( @xmath50 ) ( @xcite , and references therein ) . na49",
    "considered two locations of the cp ( shown in fig .",
    "[ cp12 ] ) . the second location of the cp ( @xmath0 for a+a collisions at @xmath2 gev , @xmath51 for p+p collisions at @xmath7 gev ) is consistent with the data .",
    "na61/shine will search for a maximum of fluctuation by a 2-d scan ( fig .",
    "[ 2dscan ] ) .",
    "there are two very interesting phenomena in high @xmath44 physics which will be studied in na61/shine .",
    "the first one is suppression of high @xmath44 particles observed by rhic experiments at @xmath52 gev collision energy @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether suppression appears already at sps energies .",
    "however , there is not sufficient statistics for p+p and p+pb collisions in the na49 experiment .",
    "na61/shine will increase these statistics by an order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the system size and energy dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath53 will be investigated ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the second interesting phenomenon , presented in @xcite , is a change of the shape of the near - side peak in the two - particle azimuthal angle correlation function with decreasing collision energy in the sps regime .",
    "it is the so - called jet - hole transition presented in fig .",
    "[ marek ] .     two - particle azimuthal angle correlation function for central pb+pb ( au+au ) events at @xmath54= 200 , 17.3 , 12.3 , 8.8 , 7.6 and 6.3 gev ( full symbols ) compared to results for central pb+pb collisions at 17.3 gev .",
    "curves represent the correlation function at @xmath54= 17.3 gev and is shown for comparison at the other energies ( for details see @xcite ) . ]    the origin of this phenomenon is not known yet and further studies are required .",
    "the na61/shine program gives the unique opportunity to reach exciting physics in a very efficient and cost effective way .",
    "there are several other complementary projects such as the rhic low energy scan ( starting in 2010 ) , nica ( starting in 2014 ) and sis-100(sis-300 ) ( starting in 2015/17 ) . the advantages of the na61/shine ion program over the rhic energy scan are :    * 2-d scan ( energy and system size ) of the phase diagram * measurements of identified hadron spectra in a broad rapidity range , which in particular allows to obtain mean hadron multiplicities in full phase space * measurements of the total number of projectile spectators including free nucleons and nucleons in nuclear fragments * high event rate in the full sps energy range including the lowest energies * low @xmath44 region accessible ( signatures of the critical point should be visible mostly in the low @xmath44 region )    on the other hand , the advantage of collider experiments is the complete azimuthal acceptance which does not depend on energy ( canceling of many systematic uncertainties ) .",
