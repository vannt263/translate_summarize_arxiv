    "the present period was determined recently to be @xmath4d ( damineli et al .",
    "according to most models , the periodicity follows the 5.54  years periodic change in the orbital separation in this highly eccentric , @xmath5 , binary system ( e.g. , hillier et al .",
    "the x - ray cycle presents a deep minimum lasting @xmath6  day ( corcoran 2005 and references therein ) and occurring more or less simultaneously with the spectroscopic event .",
    "the spectroscopic event is defined by the fading , or even disappearance , of high - ionization emission lines ( e.g. , damineli 1996 ; damineli et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2008a , b ; zanella et al .",
    "the spectroscopic event includes changes in the continuum and lines ( e.g. , martin et al .",

    "the x - ray minima and the spectroscopic events are assumed to occur near periastron passages .",
    "it is generally agreed that the orbital plane lies in the equatorial plane of the bipolar structure@xmath7the homunculus ( davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , there is a disagreement on the orientation of the seimajor axis in orbital plane , with some groups arguing that the secondary ( less massive ) star is away from us during periastron passages ( e.g. , nielsen et al . 2007 ;",
    "damineli et al .",
    "2008b ) , while others argue the secondary is toward us during periastron passages ( falceta - goncalves et al .",
    "2005 ; abrham et al . 2005 ;",
    "kashi & soker 2007b ) .",
    "other semimajor axis orientations have also been proposed ( smith et al . 2004 ; dorland 2007 ) . in any case , our present research does not depend on the orientation .    the usual assumption , the ` common model ' , is that the more massive and more luminous star is the cooler one and the one that blows the dense slow wind ( see section [ sec : profile ] below ) .",
    "we will also use the common model as our basic model .",
    "however , as our study is more general , and due to many uncertainties in the properties of , we will consider other possibilities , applicable to ( kashi et al .",
    "2008 ) , and to other more general cases .",
    "we will consider a speculative case where the slow dense wind is blown by the less massive star , and a case where the binary system is more massive .",
    "motivations for these models are discussed in kashi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "another riddle concerns the exact chain of events that cause the spectroscopic event . in general",
    "there is a slow variation along the entire orbit , the ` slow variation ' component ( damineli et al . 2008b ) , and fast variations near the event , the ` collapse ' component ( damineli et al . 2008b ) . the slow variation is probably caused by the motion of the secondary around the primary , getting in and out of the dense part of the primary wind .",
    "another effect is the slow variation of the x - ray emission .",
    "the emitting gas is the post - shock secondary wind ( pittard & corcoran 2002 ; akashi et al .",
    "2006 ) , which becomes denser as the two stars approach each other .",
    "while some lines and bands can be explained by the motion of the secondary around the primary , e.g. the radio light curve ( kashi & soker 2007a ) , other require an additional effect to account for the collapse component .",
    "such is the case for the @xmath8  week long x - ray minimum .    in a series of papers ( soker 2005 , 2007a ;",
    "akashi et al .",
    "2006 ; soker & behar 2006 ; kashi & soker 2008 ) we proposed that the fast variations during the spectroscopic event are caused by the collapse of the winds interaction region onto the secondary star . the secondary then accretes mass for @xmath2weeks , and its fast wind is blown only along the polar direction .",
    "one of the results is that the secondary wind is very weak , explaining the fast variation and minimum of the x - ray emission ( akashi et al .",
    "the accretion phase can explain also the fast changes of some spectral lines ( soker 2007a ) , and the ir emission ( kashi & soker 2008 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we go beyond previous papers in trying to explore the nature of the accretion phase , and its influence on the secondary for about half a year after the event . in  [ sec : timescales ] we discuss the relevant timescales for the accretion process . in  [ sec : profile ] we define the system parameters . ",
    "[ sec : accmass ] gives a detailed calculation for the accreted mass and angular momentum onto the secondary during the periastron passage .",

    "[ sec : dissipation ] we study processes that can account for the 6 months recovery pjase after the spectroscopic event . in  [",
    "sec : alternative ] we present speculative alternative binary models and repeat the accretion calculations for these models .",
    "we summarize in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "before considering the accretion process itself , we derive several time scales relevant to the studied processes .",
    "while the orbital period is @xmath9 years , the duration of the strong interaction near periastron passage is much shorter .",
    "we define the typical time scale of the strong interaction phase occurring near periastron passage as the time the secondary crosses a distance of the primary diameter centered at periastron . with @xmath10 being the relative velocity of the two stars at periastron this time",
    "is defined as @xmath11    under our assumptions the secondary accretes mass during periastron passages ( soker 2005 ) .",
    "this mass has angular momentum , and it accumulates around the secondary ( see section [ sec : accmass ] ) .",
    "the keplerian period on the secondary equator is @xmath12 the accretion phase in our model ( soker 2005 , 2007a ) lasts @xmath13days , as the length of the x - ray minimum ( akashi et al .",
    "2006 ) . despite the fact that @xmath14 a geometrically thin accretion disk is not formed .",
    "the reason is that the viscosity time scale in the disk @xmath15 is very long . in the @xmath16 disk model where the viscosity is @xmath17 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , where @xmath18 is the sound speed and @xmath19 the disk hight , the viscosity time scale is given by @xmath20 where the equation was scaled near the secondary equator , where the viscosity time scale is the shortest .",
    "since we expect @xmath21 , the viscosity time is not short enough to make a geometrically thin disk during the accretion time @xmath22 .",
    "however , the viscosity is not completely negligible and the accreted mass will form a thick accretion disk attached to the secondary@xmath7a _",
    "belt_.    to summarize this section , we see that the relation among the timescales is such that @xmath23 we therefore conclude that during the strong interaction phase , lasting @xmath24week , when the accretion rate is very high ( see section [ sec : accmass ] ) the accretion belt will be far from equilibrium . during the entire accretion phase , lasting @xmath2weeks ,",
    "a thick accretion disk might be formed , but not a geometrically thin one .",
    "the binary parameters used by us are based on several papers and taking into account the present disagreement on some of the binary parameters ( e.g. , ishibashi et al . 1999 ; damineli et al .",
    "2000 ; corcoran et al .",

    "2008a , b ; dorland 2007 ) .",
    "this is termed by us the ` small - masses model ' .",
    "the assumed stellar masses are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , the eccentricity is @xmath27 , and orbital period @xmath28  days ( damineli et al .",
    "2008 suggested recently that @xmath29  days ) , hence the semi - major axis is @xmath30 , and the orbital separation at periastron is @xmath31 for @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the stellar radii are taken to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the mass loss rates are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the terminal wind speeds are taken to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is assumed here that the orbital plane is oriented in the same plane as the equatorial zone of the primary s wind , and the equatorial plane of the homunculus .",
    "one has to remember that all these parameters are uncertain to some degree .",
    "the most relevant to us is the large uncertainty in the acceleration zone , i.e. , the velocity profile of the primary wind .    because the secondary gets to be very close to the primary near periastron passages , the interaction of the secondary with the primary wind strongly depends on the acceleration zone of the primary wind .",
    "the primary s wind velocity profile can be described using the @xmath38-profile : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the sound velocity on the primary s surface , @xmath41 is the primary s wind terminal velocity , and @xmath38 is a parameter of the wind model .",
    "a recent study by kraus et al . ( 2007 ) suggest that in ob - supergiants the range can be @xmath42 .",
    "we will consider the two extreme values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "benz & hills ( 1992 ) performed smooth - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of main - sequence stars whose masses differ by a factor of @xmath45 . in one of their grazing encounter simulations the lower - mass star accreted an atmosphere of gas that formed a ring around it . a ` tongue ' of gas connecting",
    "the two stars was also present at that time . in another study , yamada et al .",
    "( 2008 ) performed high resolution sph simulations of tidal encounter of a red giant star with a main sequence star .",
    "their simulations showed that for some parameters of the interacting binary system the main sequence star can accrete @xmath46 from the envelope of the red giant star , mainly as a result of tidal interaction .",
    "the red giant in the model of yamada et al .",
    "( 2008 ) does not blow any stellar wind ; a stellar wind could further enhance the accreted mass .",
    "the two studies described here motivate us to consider the accretion of mass with high specific angular momentum in each periastron passage in , as there are many similarities between the seemingly different processes of stars collision described above and of .    at periastron",
    "the orbital separation between the two stars in is @xmath47 ( depending on the eccentricity @xmath48 , and masses ) .",
    "this is so close that the secondary actually passes through the dense acceleration zone of the primary s wind .",
    "this geometry is quite similar to stellar collision , although the ` colliding ' stars in are very different in mass and physical properties from the colliding main - sequence stars studied by benz & hills ( 1992 ) .    in proposing the accretion model for the spectroscopic event ( soker 2005 ) the accretion rate",
    "was simply estimated using the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( bhl ) accretion prescription .",
    "this accretion process is for a point mass moving through a more or less homogeneous medium .",
    "however , here we have the secondary moving inside the acceleration zone of the primary wind , and a mass transfer process similar to a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) might occur for several days .",
    "( e.g. , dorland 2007 ) .",
    "it will not be a full rlof because the primary spin and orbital motion are not synchronized near periastron passage .",
    "therefore , very close to periastron passage , @xmath49day , the accretion process will be an hybrid of the bhl and the rlof mass transfer processes . at the end of the accretion",
    "phase the accretion will be of the bhl type see figure [ bhl ] and [ rl ] .",
    "because of the very complicated geometry of the colliding winds , we can only estimate the mass and angular momentum accretion rates . to be able to make these estimates , we make the following steps .    the radial ( along the line joining the two stars ) component of the relative velocity between the secondary star and the primary s wind is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 the radial component of the orbital velocity ; @xmath51 is negative when the two stars approach each other .",
    "the total relative speed between the secondary and the primary s wind is @xmath52^{1/2 } , \\label{vwind1}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the tangential component of the orbital velocity ( see figure 1 of soker 2005 ) .",
    "we neglect any time delay between ejection of the wind by the primary and its accretion onto the secondary .",
    "this assumption is justified over most of the orbit , but not near periastron when the secondary is inside the acceleration zone of the primary wind and the relative orbital velocity is not much smaller than the primary wind velocity , or even larger .",
    "nevertheless , we make this assumption as the uncertainty it introduces is much smaller than the other uncertainties , and its influence on the results is small . in particular , the tide raised by the secondary on the primary surface ( dorland 2007 ) is likely to affect the mass loss process in causing a departure from spherical symmetry and in enhancing the mass loss rate . in other words",
    ", we do nt modify the primary surface according to the gravitational potential of the secondary ( which when synchronization exists is the roche potential ) .",
    "a clear example for such tidal interaction was presented by yamada et al .",
    "we do nt consider this process here because it is much too complicated .",
    "its effect will be to increase the mass accretion rate by the secondary , hence making the processes studied by us more significant .",
    "the secondary s orbit is parameterized by the orbital angle @xmath54 , with @xmath55 at periastron .",
    "the center of the secondary is at a distance @xmath56 from the center of the primary , where @xmath57 is the semi - major axis of the elliptic orbit and @xmath27 is the eccentricity .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] here ( soker 2005 ; akashi et al .",
    "2006 ) during the accretion phase the secondary accretes from the primary wind .",
    "the effective accretion radius of the secondary @xmath58 , i.e. , the radius from where mass is accreted , depends on several parameters , in particular on the orbital separation @xmath59 .",
    "we consider the two limits of rlof and bhl accretion .",
    "we do nt really consider the flow of gas in a rlof type situation .",
    "we rather take the circular accretion radius to be equal to the roche lobe equivalent radius , ( eggleton 1983 ) to give some weight to the gravity of the two stars .",
    "this radius is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass ratio in the common model .",
    "we note again that we use this approximation for the rl radius even that the system is not synchronized .",
    "we define the accretion plane to be perpendicular to the orbital plane and rotated in an angle @xmath63 from the line connecting the two stars , away from the primary , where @xmath64 we define the angle @xmath65 as the azimuthal angle in that plane , measured from the direction away from the primary , as drawn schematically in figure [ numprofile ] . in both cases ( bhl and rlof ) near periastron @xmath66 is not much smaller than the orbital separation .",
    "therefore , the density of the primary wind can not be treated as a constant in the cross section of the accretion cylinder@xmath7the circle of radius @xmath66 drawn in figure [ numprofile ] .",
    "to calculate the dependance of the primary wind density on @xmath65 and on the distance from the secondary , we slice the cross section to @xmath67 arcs , as drawn in figure [ numprofile ] . the accreted mass from each arc is calculated separately according to the density at that point , and it is added to the accreted mass .",
    "each arc has coordinates @xmath68 : @xmath69 are the coordinates relative to the secondary , where @xmath70 is the distance from the secondary , and @xmath71 is the location of the secondary in the orbit .",
    "these quantities are defined also in figure [ numgeometry ] .",
    "the distance of an arc from the primary is given by @xmath72 as before , we neglect the delay between the position of the primary when it ejected the wind and its present location , such that the primary wind density is given @xmath73    the area of each arc is given by @xmath74 where in our calculation @xmath75 and @xmath76 . as the secondary moves on its orbit from @xmath71 to @xmath77 the arc moves an azimuthal distance @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the corresponding time it takes for the secondary to pass that orbital angle .",
    "the volume swept by the arc in each evolutionary step is @xmath80 the mass accreted by each arc is therefore @xmath81 .",
    "the total accreted mass as a function of the orbital angle is @xmath82 from this quantity we can derive the mass accretion rate by @xmath83 , where @xmath79 is the time it takes the secondary to move the orbital angle @xmath84 .",
    "the total accreted mass along the orbit is @xmath85 where summation is from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , which is the time interval when accretion is assumed to take place ( akashi et al .",
    "the maximum of @xmath88 is the total accreted mass @xmath89 .",
    "the calculation was processed for the eight cases summarized in table [ table : macc ] .",
    "the variation of the accretion rate and accreted mass with time are presented in figure [ bhl ] for the bhl type accretion flow , and in figure [ rl ] for the case where the accretion radius is taken from the roche lobe geometry to mimic rlof type accretion .",
    "we emphasize again that what we term rlof is not a real rlof .",
    "it is rather estimation of the accretion rate by taking the accretion radius to be equal to the average radius of the secondary s roche lobe .",
    ".the accreted mass and specific angular momentum for the studied cases . in the second column the accretion mode according to which the accretion radius is calculated : roche lobe overflow ( rl ) or bondi - holye - lyttleton ( bhl ) .",
    "the third column is the eccentricity of the binary system . in the fourth column",
    "the value of @xmath38 in the primary s wind velocity profile is given ( equation [ v1 ] ) .",
    "in the fifth and sixth columns the results of the calculations are given : the total accreted mass during the assumed 10 weeks accretion phase , and the specific angular momentum of this mass @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "@xmath90 is given in units of the specific angular momentum of a circular keplerian orbit on the secondary equator , @xmath91 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our reference model is the commonly assumed model , the common model , where the primary blows the slow dense wind , and the masses of the two stars are @xmath92 . we term the common model the dense primary - wind version of the small - masses model .      1 .   for eccentricity of @xmath93",
    "the accreting star is most likely to accrete @xmath94 during each periastron passage .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the accreted mass is larger than , or about equal to , the value that is required to perform a keplerian motion around the accreting star .",
    "therefore , in most cases an accretion disk will be formed ( beside may be in the dense secondary - wind version of the small - masses model ; see table [ table : sum ] ) .",
    "however , the viscosity time scale is long , and the disk will not reach an equilibrium . in any case , most of the accreted mass will be accreted from regions close to the equatorial plane , and a belt of gas will be formed near the accreting star equator .",
    "the effective temperature on the surface of the belt region is lower , and uv radiation softer .",
    "3 .   the viscosity time scale is too long ( section [ sec : timescales ] ) , and it is not efficient in transporting angular momentum and in dissipating the thick disk ( or belt ) .",
    "we assume that it is the wind from the accreting star , which rebuilds itself after the accretion phase , that expels the mass in the belt .",
    "the ejection of the belt by the wind requires several months .",
    "we suggest to identify this time period with the half a year recovery phase of some spectral lines .",
    "our accretion model , where mass is accreted for several weeks near periastron passages , is not commonly accepted by the community .",
    "our goal here is to show that even under conservative assumptions and approximations , mass accretion is very likely to occur .",
    "namely , even when we neglect the tidal force of the secondary on the primary , and when we consider only the tangential motion very close to periastron , we can not avoid the conclusion that the secondary gravitationally accretes mass for several weeks .",
    "the most clear prediction of the model is the presence of an accretion disk , or a belt if the disk is close to the equator of the accreting star and is not in equilibrium ( because the viscosity time is longer than the duration of the accretion phase ) .",
    "accretion disks have clear signatures , like broad and/or double peaked emission lines",
    ". however , the same dense wind that is accreted obscures the relevant regions .",
    "therefore , we must examine indirect indications .",
    "\\(1 ) _ the duration of the accretion phase . _",
    "the accretion process strongly depends on the eccentricity of the orbit , the mass of the accreting star , and the winds properties .",
    "the masses and eccentricity have negligible changes from orbit to orbit .",
    "however , stellar winds are known to be stochastic .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the slow dense wind will be stronger or weaker in the next event .",
    "this will result in a change in the duration of the the x - ray minimum . in the last two cycles",
    "the two x - ray minima last for the same time , with only small variations at the beginning and end of the minimum .",
    "this indicates that the winds did not change much between these two cycles .",
    "if the winds properties will not change much by january 2009 , then the x - ray minimum will last for @xmath8 weeks again .",
    "however , if significant changes will occur in the winds , mainly in the slow dense wind , then we expect the duration of the x - ray minimum to be shorter or longer , for a weaker or a stronger slow dense wind , respectively . because of the fast variation in orbital separation close to periastron , the change in the x - ray minimum duration will be of only several days .",
    "\\(2 ) _ polar outflow . _",
    "the accretion from the equatorial region leaves the polar directions clear for the secondary weaker wind , or for a polar outflow blown by the accretion disk .",
    "again , the visible and uv bands are obscured .",
    "however , hard x - ray emission might be detected .",
    "in particular , such a polar outflow might be strong when the fast wind builds itself .",
    "we encourage a search for doppler shifts in x - ray emission and absorption lines as the systems exits the x - ray minimum .",
    "most emission from the red - shifted polar outflow will be absorbed , and we expect for a blue shifted emission during that time .",
    "we note that hints for a polar outflow exist from x - ray emission lines several weeks before the event ( behar et al .",
    "several weeks before the event is before the accretion phases has started .",
    "only accretion of dense blobs is possible .",
    "\\(3 ) _ polar illumination . _",
    "the accretion disk , or belt , will survive for weeks to months after the accretion ends . during that time the accreting star will illuminate and ionize the polar directions much more than in the equatorial plane .",
    "this effect has already been observed by stahl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and weis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who found that the spectroscopic event is more pronounced in the equatorial and mid latitudes directions than in the polar directions .",
    "we expect this effect to be strong during the accretion phase , coincide with the x - ray minimum , and to continue for weeks after .",
    "\\(4 ) the x - ray observations presented by hamaguchi et al . ( 2007 ) are not frequent enough to present the evolution of the x - ray emission of the cooler component ( below 5 mev ) .",
    "we hope frequent observations will be made during the x - ray minimum of the next cycle ( january to march 2009 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we suggest that the origin of part of this gas with high em and @xmath95 is a disk outflow .",
    "we therefore predict that the high em of this gas will be built during the high accretion rate time , phase 0.995 - 1.01 , when the disk builds itself .",
