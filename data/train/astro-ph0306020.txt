    "the abundance of cluster of galaxies places a strong constraint on fundamental cosmological parameters such as the amplitude of mass fluctuations on a scale of @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and the present mass density parameter , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although the abundance of clusters is strong function of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the evolution of the cluster abundance with redshift breaks the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite pointed out that the relatively high abundance of massive cluster at @xmath3 prefers large mass fluctuations @xmath4 . on the other hand , the local cluster abundance in both optical @xcite and x - ray @xcite",
    "wavebands suggests low mass fluctuations @xmath5 for @xmath6 . the combination of local and high-@xmath7 cluster abundances yields relatively low matter density in the universe , e.g. , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , other observations , such as the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background @xcite and type ia supernovae @xcite , prefer somewhat larger matter density ; @xmath9 from wmap plus large scale structure @xcite or @xmath10 from type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "although all these results are consistent with each other within @xmath11 level , the slight difference of @xmath0 or @xmath1 might be interpreted that underlying models are wrong @xcite .",
    "although the above constraints are derived assuming the usual stable cold dark matter model , the evolution may be considerably different if cold dark matter particles are not perfectly stable and decay into relativistic particles with a decay rate @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the cluster abundance may become a useful test to explore the nature of dark matter .",
    "the decaying cold dark matter model has been studied so far in several contexts , e.g. , to reconcile einstein - de sitter universe with current low matter universe @xcite , to explain unexpected x - ray observations @xcite , or to reduce possible over - concentration of dark matter and over - abundance of substructures in cold dark matter model @xcite . moreover , cold dark matter with similar property , disappearing dark matter , has also attracted much attention in the context of the brane world scenario @xcite . in the brane world scenario a bulk scalar field can be trapped on the brane , which is identified with our universe , and become cold dark matter .",
    "but since the scalar field is expected to be metastable , it decays into continuum states in the higher dimension with some decay width @xmath12 , which is determined by the mass of the scalar field and the energy scale of the extradimension @xcite .",
    "an observer on the brane sees this as if the scalar field disappears into the extradimension leaving some energy on the brane .",
    "this energy behaves in the same way as energy of relativistic particles but does not correspond to real particles .",
    "thus this is called `` dark radiation '' .",
    "although the disappearing dark matter and the decaying dark matter are not the same , they contribute to the expansion of the universe in the same way .",
    "hereafter we call both of them decaying dark matter .",
    "@xcite studied the universe with the decaying dark matter as a test of brane world scenario .",
    "they found that decaying cold dark matter model with lifetime about the age of the universe improve the fit of type ia supernovae observations and the evolution of mass - to - light ratios of clusters .    in this paper ,",
    "we study structure formation in the decaying cold dark matter universe ; we present the spherical model , make theoretical predictions for the cluster abundance , and show that the evolution of the cluster abundance is quite sensitive to the decay rate of dark matter particles .",
    "we also compare our predictions with observed low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 cluster abundances , and see if the decaying cold dark matter model explains the relatively large cluster abundance at high-@xmath7 universe .",
    "to study the cluster abundance , we need the mass function of dark halos in decaying cold dark matter model . in this section , we construct the mass function using the spherical model as in @xcite .",
    "we also present the nonlinear overdensity @xmath13 which is important in studying the cluster abundance . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat universe .",
    "we consider the case that dark matter particles decay into relativistic particles , which are assumed to contribute to the structure formation only through the change of the expansion law of the universe by their energy behavior .",
    "rate equations of matter and radiation components in the decaying dark matter model are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this results in the following evolution of matters and radiations : @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . here",
    "we assume no radiation component except for decay products .",
    "the friedmann equation then becomes @xmath18 this equation should be solved with the equation of the cosmological time @xmath19 simultaneously . by combining these two equations , we obtain a following differential equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "note that the current density parameter @xmath1 should satisfy the freidmann equation at @xmath22 : @xmath23 therefore the current density parameter @xmath1 is uniquely determined for given @xmath12 and @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "next consider the linear perturbation .",
    "the density perturbation is denoted by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is background matter density .",
    "then perturbation equation becomes @xmath28 we solve this differential equation with the boundary condition @xmath29 at @xmath30 .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe the spherical collapse model in decaying dark matter model and give the methodology to calculate nonlinear overdensity @xmath13 .",
    "first we consider a spherical overdensity with initial mass @xmath31 and radius @xmath32 .",
    "the equation of motion of such a spherical shell is given by @xmath33 we define the following quantities : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 represents the scale factor at turnaround .",
    "then equations we should solve are the two dimensionless equations : @xmath40 @xmath41 , \\label{radius_sc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the density contrast of the spherical overdensity region at turnaround , @xmath43 . we solve these equation from @xmath44 to the virialization of the overdensity region with boundary conditions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in order to derive @xmath50 and @xmath42 .",
    "although the conventional choice of the virialization epoch is the collapse time ( @xmath51 ) , in this paper we define the virialization epoch when the virial theorem in the following holds : @xmath52 given the virialization epoch and virial radius , the nonlinear overdensity can be calculated from @xmath53 . to calculate the cluster abundance",
    ", we also need the extrapolation of the linear fluctuation @xmath54 at virialization .",
    "we use @xmath55 , which is the value in einstein - de sitter universe for all cosmological models , mainly because of the computational cost .",
    "this simplification does not change our results because we confirmed that @xmath54 only weakly depends on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we derive the mass function of clusters using the theory of @xcite .",
    "first start from an initial density field @xmath56 smoothed over the region containing mass @xmath57 .",
    "if the initial density field is random gaussian , a probability distribution function of @xmath58 at any point is given by @xmath59=\\frac{1}{\\left(2\\pi\\right)^{1/2}\\sigma_{m_i}(z_i ) } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\delta^2(m_i , z_i)}{2\\sigma^2_{m_i}(z_i)}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the mass variance .",
    "from the spherical model , it can be interpreted that the region is already virialized at @xmath7 if the linearly extrapolated density contrast @xmath61 exceeds the critical value @xmath62 .",
    "therefore the probability that the region with mass @xmath31 is already virialized is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the complementary error function , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is linear growth rate calculated from equation ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "we assume the mass variance for the cold dark matter fluctuation spectrum with the primordial spectral index @xmath68 , and adopt a fitting formula presented by @xcite . from equation ( [ fractionfunction ] )",
    ", we finally obtain the comoving number density of halos of mass @xmath31 at time @xmath7 : @xmath69\\right|_{m_i = me^{\\gamma t } } , \\label{pressschechter}\\ ] ] with @xmath70 .",
    "in the model described in the previous section , the abundance and its redshift evolution of clusters are fully determined by three independent parameters ; @xmath24 , @xmath0 , and @xmath12 . in this section ,",
    "we see the dependence of the cluster abundances on these parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : cluabu ] plots the number density of clusters as a function of redshift .",
    "we consider the cases with the lifetime of dark matter @xmath71 , and also with the usual infinite lifetime of dark matter for reference .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the mass within a comoving radius of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , to compare our theoretical predictions with observed cluster abundance . for the extrapolation to @xmath74",
    ", we use the observed cluster profile , @xmath75 @xcite . for the observed cluster abundance",
    ", we plot the data compiled by @xcite ; abundance at @xmath76 from @xcite , at @xmath77 from @xcite , at @xmath78 and @xmath79 from @xcite .",
    "obviously , inclusion of finite lifetime greatly improves the situation : for @xmath71 both local and high-@xmath7 cluster abundance can be reproduced with the same @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath80 it is difficult to explain local ( @xmath76 ) and high-@xmath7 ( @xmath81 ) cluster abundances simultaneously , although both can be reconciled if we adopt larger @xmath24 , @xmath82 .",
    "this drastic change of the evolution of the cluster abundance implies that it can place a strong constraint on the decay rate of cold dark matter .    to see how large decay rate is required to explain the observations , in figure [ fig : gs ] we show the constraints from low-@xmath7 @xcite and high-@xmath7 @xcite cluster abundances assuming @xmath83 .",
    "we find that the lifetime of @xmath84 can explain both low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 cluster abundances .",
    "interestingly , this decay rate is roughly consistent with that derived from the evolution of mass - to - light ratios @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "we plot the constraint in the @xmath86-@xmath0 plane in figure [ fig : os ] with @xmath87 .",
    "we also show the constraint from the observation of type ia supernovae complied by @xcite assuming the same value of @xmath88 .",
    "we use the sample of 172 supernovae with @xmath89 and @xmath90 mag to avoid possible systematics .",
    "the resulting limit on @xmath91 is @xmath92 ( 68% confidence limit ) , slightly lower than the limit in the case of no decay ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we find that the best - fit parameter set @xmath94 is consistent with the result of type ia supernovae as well as the evolution of the cluster abundance .",
    "we have presented structure formation model in decaying cold dark matter universe .",
    "more specifically , we have calculated the spherical model and construct the mass function in the similar way as the theory of @xcite . using this mass function , we have shown that decaying cold dark matter model with @xmath84 can explain observed cluster abundances at both low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 universe even better than the usual stable cold dark matter model .",
    "our model may be also consistent with the excess of cosmic microwave background fluctuations on small scales ; large mass fluctuations @xmath95 are required to account for this excess if it is interpreted as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect of the cluster at @xmath96 @xcite .    while we have concentrated on the evolution of the cluster abundance , it is interesting to ask whether the decaying cold dark matter model is consistent with other observations such as the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background and large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "for instance , @xcite constrained the cosmological parameters as @xmath97 from the power spectrum of galaxy clustering .",
    "since the power spectrum mainly measures the epoch of the matter - radiation equality , @xmath98 should be interpreted as @xmath99 in the decaying cold dark matter model . in the case of @xmath100 , @xmath87",
    ", we constrained @xmath91 as @xmath101 with 68% confidence level .",
    "this allowed range corresponds to @xmath102 , thus marginally consistent with the observed power spectrum .",
    "moreover , the situation becomes better if the hubble constant is smaller than 0.7 .",
    "for the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background , it is difficult to infer the consequence of decaying cold dark matter model because many parameters degenerate .",
    "we plan to study comprehensive constraints of these observations on decaying cold dark matter model , which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we note that our modeling of mass function may be inaccurate because it has been claimed that the mass function of @xcite , particularly at high mass region , tends to underestimate the abundance of the massive halos compared with @xmath103-body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may be a part of reason that the cluster abundance in our modeling based on the theory of @xcite seems to decline slightly faster with redshift than that in @xcite who used the result of @xmath103-body simulations .",
    "thus the constraints on the decay rate @xmath12 ( e.g. , figure [ fig : gs ] ) may be weaken a bit if we use more accurate mass function in decaying cold dark matter model .",
    "one way to refine the model is to resort @xmath103-body simulations , as in the case of the standard cold dark matter model .",
    "nevertheless we believe that our qualitative result that decaying cold dark matter model tends to lower the ratio of the local cluster abundance to the high - redshift cluster abundance is still unchanged even if we adopt more accurate mass functions .",
    "the cluster abundance at higher redshift universe @xmath104 , which will be obtained by future surveys of x - ray or sunyaev - zeldovich effects , can tightly constrain the decay rate of dark matter .",
