    "these lecture notes are intended to illustrate in a simple manner how spectral functions , viz .",
    "heat - trace and @xmath0-function , are used to compute leading quantum corrections to physical quantities in field theory .",
    "the applications we consider are well - known and have been studied with one approach or another in most textbooks in quantum field theory .",
    "our main purpose is to readily provide , through a few plain examples , the basic tools of functional methods in field theory .",
    "quantum effects in a particular field theory can be read from the spectrum of a certain differential operator .",
    "the effective action , for example , is given by the determinant on the infinite - dimensional hilbert space of an unbounded operator .",
    "this `` infinite '' determinant can be written in terms of a _",
    "divergent series_. fortunately , several criteria exist which allow us to unambiguously determine the sum of some divergent series .",
    "this procedure of assigning a finite value to a divergent series is equivalent to the `` regularization '' of the uv - divergencies that occur in the computation of one - loop feynman diagrams .",
    "the functional method described in the present notes defines the value of a divergent series in terms of analytic extensions in the complex plane , the so - called `` @xmath0-function regularization '' .",
    "the heat - kernel ( or the corresponding heat - trace ) is a mathematical tool closely related to the @xmath0-function which serves as a complementary regularization scheme .    after introducing the heat - trace , the @xmath0-function and the main relation between them ( section [ defs ] ) , we give an example where a @xmath0-function is used to determine the value of some particular divergent series ( section [ ae ] ) . to show a physical consequence of this definition , we study the casimir effect in its simplest version ( sections [ cas1 ] and [ cas2 ] ) . we also give an interpretation of this definition of divergent sums by comparing the @xmath0-function method with the regularization in terms of a general cutoff function ( section [ rama ] ) . some relation between the use of analytic extensions and classical definitions of divergent series ( cesro ,",
    "abel and borel summability ) is illustrated with examples in appendix [ divsums ] .",
    "next we introduce one of the most powerful results in the theory of spectral functions : the asymptotic expansion of the heat - trace ( section [ ht ] ) ; this expansion allows us to write a general expression for the effective action in terms of the seeley - de witt coefficients . as an example , we compute the @xmath1-function of a real scalar field with a quartic self - interaction ( section [ efac ] ) .",
    "the equivalence between the heat - trace and the @xmath0-function regularizations is then understood from the point of view of renormalization theory in qft ( section [ rela ] ) .",
    "the heat - trace can be used , in particular , to study the effect of quantum oscillations of an electron / positron system in constant magnetic or electric backgrounds . in this context",
    ", we compute the @xmath1-function of qed and the rate of pair production in the presence of strong electric fields ( section [ sch ] ) .",
    "our last examples consist in the computation of the @xmath1-function of yang - mills theories through the straightforward application of the heat - trace asymptotic expansion ( section [ ym ] ) , of thermodynamical quantities in field theory at finite temperature ( section [ fintem ] ) and the propagator in a noncommutative field theory , whose nonplanar contribution exhibits the uv / ir mixing effect ( section [ nc ] ) .    for the sake of clarity , we have chosen the simplest cases leaving aside any complexity which could obscure the presentation . furthermore , the main mathematical results are stated without a detailed description of the assumed hypotheses , or a rigourous mathematical proof",
    ". as a compensation for these omissions we expect to provide through quite explicit examples the tools for a succinct calculation of these well - known quantum effects in field theory .",
    "heat - kernel and @xmath0-function techniques deal with the calculation of the following related sums : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 with @xmath5 large enough and @xmath6 are eigenvalues of some positive definite ( differential ) operator , i.e. , @xmath7 in general , @xmath8 represents a multi - index or even a continuous variable that characterizes the eigenstate . of particular interest",
    "are the expansion of the first sum ( heat - trace ) for small @xmath9 and the analytic extension of the second sum ( @xmath0-function ) to the whole complex @xmath10-plane .",
    "let us begin by considering a second order differential operator @xmath11 acting on a hilbert space of functions @xmath12 ; take , for example , the one - dimensional laplacian @xmath13 acting on the space @xmath14 of square integrable functions @xmath15 on the interval @xmath16 $ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath17 .",
    "let us then assume that @xmath12 has an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 of @xmath11 with eigenvalues @xmath20 in our example , the normalized eigenfunctions of the one - dimensional laplacian @xmath21 have eigenvalues @xmath22 which , as expected , grow to infinity with @xmath8 .",
    "the heat - trace can now be defined as @xmath23 for @xmath3 . in our example",
    "@xmath24 which can be written in terms of a jacobi theta - function , @xmath25 since the operator of our example does not have a zero mode , the heat - trace decreases exponentially as @xmath26 .",
    "more important to us is that , due to the infinite dimensionality of the hilbert space , the heat - trace diverges for small @xmath9 ; the general behaviour of the heat - trace for small @xmath9 is established in section .",
    "the @xmath0-function is defined as @xmath27 if @xmath5 is large enough , or as its ( unique ) analytic extension if not . in our example , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is known as the riemann @xmath0-function , and defined as @xmath30 for @xmath31 , or as its analytic extension otherwise . as a function on the whole complex plane @xmath32 has a unique simple pole at @xmath33 and vanishes at negative even integers",
    "; b.  riemann conjectured that any other zero of @xmath32 must be located at the line @xmath34 .",
    "we can now derive a very useful relation between both spectral functions . applying the relation",
    "( mellin transform ) @xmath35 to each eigenvalue @xmath6 and performing the sum over the whole spectrum of @xmath11 we obtain @xmath36 this expression allows us to compute the analytic extension of the @xmath0-function from the asymptotic expansion of the heat - trace for small values of @xmath9 .",
    "as an example of the concepts of the previous section , let us consider the case in which the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath11 are given by @xmath37 the corresponding @xmath0-function is then the riemann @xmath0-function @xmath32 , defined as the analytic extension of the series given by , which is convergent for @xmath31 .",
    "in order to study its analytic extension to the whole complex plane we compute the corresponding heat - trace @xmath38 and use mellin transform , given by , to write @xmath39 as expected , the integral is well - defined only for @xmath31 ; otherwise it diverges at @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , the analytic extension of @xmath32 to the rest of the complex plane is determined by the behaviour of the heat - trace for small values of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we separate the integral at large values of @xmath9 ( say @xmath41 ) from small values of @xmath9 ( then @xmath42 ) and use for the latter the expansion @xcite @xmath43 which is actually valid for @xmath44 ; @xmath45 are the bernoulli numbers . after integrating this powers series in the interval",
    "@xmath16 $ ] we obtain @xmath46 although the previous manipulations are only valid for @xmath31 , expression now gives the analytic extension of @xmath32 to the whole complex plane : the first term between brackets is an entire function whereas the series in the second term is analytic for all @xmath4 , except where it presents simple poles namely , at @xmath33 and at all negative integers .",
    "however , since the term @xmath47 vanishes at negative integers then the riemann @xmath0-function has a unique pole at @xmath33 , the residue being @xmath48 .",
    "the term @xmath47 also facilitates the determination of @xmath32 at each negative integer , which is given by the corresponding residue of the expression in brackets .",
    "for instance , at @xmath49 only the term in the series corresponding to @xmath50 gives a nonvanishing value , @xmath51 since the value of @xmath32 at a negative integer @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath53 and bernoulli numbers of odd order vanish except from @xmath54 then the riemann @xmath0-function vanishes at even negative integers ; these are the trivial zeroes of @xmath32 . on the contrary , at odd negative integers @xmath55 , so that , e.g. , @xmath56    in summary , expression is only valid for @xmath31 but it suffices to define @xmath32 in the whole complex plane as its unique analytic extension . in the @xmath0-function regularization scheme ,",
    "the analytic extensions we have just computed are used to define the sum of the following divergent series : @xmath57    1 + 2 + 3+\\ldots&:=\\zeta_r(-1)=-\\tfrac1{12}\\,,\\\\[2 mm ]    1 + 4 + 9+\\ldots&:=\\zeta_r(-2)=0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] certainly , any definition might seem uncanny insofar as it assigns a vanishing or even a negative value to a sum of positive terms . in section [ rama ] where we regularize these divergent series with a smooth function of compact support we will understand how these unexpected values appear after subtracting the infinite contribution originated by the removal of the cutoff . in appendix [ divsums ] a comparison between analytic extensions and other definitions of divergent sums is sketched .",
    "before giving an insight into this intriguing regularization of divergent sums , we apply the results they provide to the calculation of a physical quantity , namely the vacuum energy of a ring generated by the quantum oscillations of the field of a scalar particle .",
    "later , in section [ cas2 ] , we will compute the vacuum energy in a more realistic setting where the predictions of the @xmath0-function regularization have been experimentally confirmed .",
    "let us consider a massless scalar particle on a ring of radius @xmath58 .",
    "its dynamics in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics is described by a wave function @xmath59 that satisfies @xmath60 this equation has infinitely many stationary solutions which can be identified with an integer @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 , due to periodicity in @xmath65 . from the point of view of classical mechanics , each of these solutions with momentum @xmath66 and positive energy @xmath67 is a travelling wave that can also be considered as a normal mode of frequency @xmath67 of a system of infinitely many coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the quantization of the field @xmath59 is equivalent to the quantization of this infinite set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "as is well - known , due to quantum oscillations , the minimum energy of a single harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 .",
    "as a consequence , the minimum energy of the quantized field should correspond to the ( infinite ) sum of the ground state energies of all the normal modes of the system of coupled oscillators .    in the language of quantum field theory ,",
    "the space of physical states of the quantized field is spanned by vectors characterized by the number of scalar particles in each of the stationary solutions . in particular",
    ", there is a vector @xmath70 which represents the vacuum state , i.e. , the state that describes the system in the absence of such particles .",
    "surprisingly , although the total number of particles in the vacuum state @xmath71 vanishes , its energy @xmath72 is not necessarily zero . as explained above , in the case of the particle in a ring , @xmath73 corresponds to the infinite sum @xmath74 which interestingly depends on the size of the ring . as a matter of fact , it is obvious from dimensional reasons that @xmath73 should be proportional to @xmath75 but we obtained for the proportionality coefficient a divergent series of positive terms ; should it be a positive number ?",
    "is there a way to get some physical information from expression ? in the @xmath0-function regularization described in the previous section , the vacuum energy @xmath73 is defined as @xmath76 this result indicates that , even in the absence of the massless particle , the quantum oscillations of its vacuum state originate an attractive force under which the ring tends to shrink to zero size .",
    "in this section we will determine the casimir force between two parallel plates ; our purpose is to give some more details of the basic framework of quantum field theory , as well as to illustrate some usual manipulations regarding the computation of the analytic extension of the @xmath0-function in terms of the asymptotic expansion of the heat - trace .",
    "let us then consider a relativistic massive particle confined between two plates separated a distance @xmath77 in the @xmath78-direction . in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics the particle",
    "is described by a wave function @xmath79 with support in @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 that minimizes the action @xmath83=\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}dt\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^2}d^2y\\int_0^l",

    "let us compute the spectrum of this operator .",

    "in fact , the vacuum expectation value of this hamiltonian ( per unit area in the directions parameterized by @xmath81 ) results @xmath100 which , as mentioned in section [ cas1 ] , is the sum of the ground state energies of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath101 .",
    "expression is of course ill - defined since the series and the integral are not convergent , due to the behaviour of @xmath101 for large @xmath8 and @xmath102 ; this is a manifestation of the uv - divergencies one encounters when computing quantum corrections in field theories .",
    "the @xmath0-function method provides a regularization of this divergence by means of the following function of the complex variable @xmath4 : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the @xmath0-function of the operator @xmath11 , defined as @xmath105 for @xmath106 , or as its analytic extension otherwise .",
    "note that , for dimensional reasons , we have also introduced a parameter @xmath107 as an arbitrary scale with mass dimensions whose physical significance will be elucidated later . finally , by comparison with eq .",
    ", the vacuum energy is defined as the analytic extension of @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "if the @xmath0-function were analytic at this point of the complex plane then the vacuum energy would be as one would expect independent of the arbitrary scale @xmath107 , but this might not be the case .",
    "as we did in section [ ae ] for the riemann @xmath0-function , in order to obtain the analytic extension of we first compute the heat - trace of the operator @xmath11 , @xmath110      & = \\frac{e^{-\\tau m^2}}{(4\\pi\\tau)^{\\frac32 } }      \\left\\{l-\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\tau^{\\frac12}+2l\\ , \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty e^{-\\frac{l^2}{\\tau}\\,n^2}\\right\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , after integrating in @xmath90 , we have rewritten the sum by using poisson inversion formula , @xmath111 because it makes explicit the divergent behaviour of the heat - trace for small values of the parameter @xmath9 . from relation",

    ", @xmath104 has a simple pole at @xmath33 ( due to the second term in ) and an infinite number of other simple poles at @xmath114 ( due to the first term in ) .",
    "in particular , it has a simple pole at @xmath109 with residue @xmath115 .",
    "the function @xmath108 can thus be written at @xmath116 as @xmath117 where the finite part reads @xmath118-\\frac{m^2}{8\\pi^2 l}\\,\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{k_2(2mln)}{n^2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as was already seen in expression , a pole in @xmath104 at @xmath119 brings forth a ( logarithmic ) dependence of the vacuum energy on the arbitrary scale @xmath107 . in the massless case , where the only dimensionful parameter is @xmath77 , the analytic extension of @xmath108 is finite at @xmath109 and thus @xmath107-independent ; therefore , the limit @xmath120 of expression gives an unambiguous result for the vacuum energy ( per unit area ) , @xmath121 however , the simple pole of @xmath108 at @xmath119 for the massive case requires some additional physical prescription to define a renormalized vacuum energy .",
    "for instance , if the field is infinitely massive then quantum oscillations are blurred and , consequently , the vacuum energy is expected to vanish ; thus an admissible procedure consists in removing ( by a minimal subtraction ) those terms in eq .   which do not vanish in the @xmath122 limit . after this subtraction we obtain for the vacuum energy of the massive field",
    "@xmath123 taking into account that the physical consequences of the vacuum energy are associated with its variation with the separation of the plates , one could also remove from expression those terms which are independent of @xmath77 , as well as those linear in @xmath77 which together with the vacuum energy in the space outside the plates give an @xmath77-independent contribution of the vacuum energy of the whole space @xmath124 . the result obtained with this prescription",
    "is again given by expression .",
    "in conclusion , there must exist an attractive force ( per unit area ) between two dirichlet - type parallel plates , that is originated by the quantum oscillations of the vacuum state of the field .",
    "since the force is exponentially decreasing for massive fields , the most prominent contribution corresponds to the oscillations of massless particles .",
    "the pressure on the parallel plates is given by the variation of the vacuum energy with their distance , which for the massless case reads ( see eq .  ) , @xmath125 this pressure is represented in figure [ casimir ] , as well as for the massive case ( see eq .  ) , as a function of the separation of the plates .",
    "m ) for massless and massive ( @xmath126 ) fields.,height=188 ]    as the figure shows , at a plates separation of 1@xmath107 m , massless fields originate a small pressure of the order of mpa ; for a mass of @xmath127 the pressure decreases to @xmath128 this value , whereas it is completely negligible for masses of the order of mev .",
    "this effect was predicted in 1948 by h.  b.  g.  casimir @xcite , who studied the attraction experienced by two parallel conducting plates due to the vacuum oscillations of the electromagnetic field . already in 1958",
    "this casimir force could be experimentally observed @xcite . since then , much more accurate experiments have successfully measured the casimir force in different settings @xcite and are used nowadays to test many theoretical models that take into account more realistic aspects , such as the finite conductivity of the boundaries , the roughness of their surfaces as well as the effect of temperature .",
    "in the previous sections we have defined the result of a divergent series in terms of the analytic extension of the @xmath0-function and we have found that this result leads to physical predictions the casimir force that have been confirmed by very accurate experiments . nevertheless , a physicist might be more familiar with the regularization of a divergent sum in terms of a cutoff function . in this section",
    "we will compare both procedures in order to become more familiar with the meaning of the definition in terms of analytic extensions .",
    "based on euler - maclaurin formula @xmath129    + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{b_{2n}}{(2n)!}\\left[f^{(2n-1)}(n)-f^{(2n-1)}(0)\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ramanujan computed the value of a divergent series using an appropriate cutoff function @xcite .",
    "we will depict his procedure by computing the same infinite sums which we have already computed using the ( riemann ) @xmath0-function regularization .",
    "let then @xmath130 be a smooth , positive and bounded function with support in the interval @xmath16 $ ] and such that , for some @xmath131 , takes the constant value @xmath132 for any @xmath133 .",
    "if we apply euler - maclaurin formula to the function @xmath134 , for @xmath135 , we readily obtain @xmath136 where the lower sign should be used only for the particular case @xmath137 .",
    "we conclude that if we replace the infinite sum of the @xmath138-th powers of positive integers with the sum of the first @xmath139 terms smoothed with a cutoff @xmath140 we obtain an expression which , unsurprisingly , diverges as @xmath141 . however , this divergence can be isolated in a term which corresponds to the integral in euler - maclaurin formula ( proportional to the @xmath138-th moment @xmath142 $ ] of @xmath143 ) .",
    "the remainder is a finite term which is independent of the cutoff and coincides with the value given by the analytic extension of the corresponding @xmath0-function ; ramanujan claimed this term `` is like the center of gravity of a body '' .",

    ", the analytic extension @xmath32 gives the difference between the divergent `` smoothed '' series and the corresponding `` smoothed '' integral .",

    "such an operator defines a generalized heat - equation ( or evolution equation in euclidean time , if @xmath11 were a hamiltonian ) @xmath149 whose solution under some given initial condition @xmath150 can be written in terms of the integral operator @xmath151 , called heat - operator ( or evolution operator in euclidean time ) , as follows , @xmath152 if , as before , @xmath148 has an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions @xmath153 of @xmath11 with eigenvalues @xmath20 , then the heat - kernel @xmath154 can be written as the series @xmath155 and the heat - trace is @xmath156 where @xmath157 represents the finite trace in the @xmath158 part of @xmath148 .",

    "let us first consider cesro summation which , if the sequence of partial sums does not converge , defines the divergent series as the limit , if it exists , of the averages of the divergent sums .",
    "take , for example , the series @xmath386 whose partial sums give @xmath387 although this oscillating series is not convergent the averages of the partial sums give the sequence @xmath388 that converges to @xmath389 .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath390 where @xmath391 stands for `` the first average of partial sums '' .",
    "to explain this notation , let us next consider the series @xmath392 whose partial sums give @xmath393 .",
    "the sequence of averages of this sequence is @xmath394 which oscillates around the two values @xmath395 and @xmath389 .",

    "therefore , we write @xmath398 where @xmath399 stands for the second average which was required to consider in order to obtain a convergent sequence .",
    "following the same arguments one can prove that @xmath400 as expected , the more divergent the absolute values of the term in the series are , the more number of averages have to be taken into account .",
    "the interpretation of this method is that if a series @xmath401 is not summable , then the sequence @xmath402 is not convergent .",
    "the average of partial sums instead give the sequence @xmath403 the idea behind @xmath391 is that instead of adding a full term @xmath249 at each step of a partial sum , only a fraction of it is added ; of course , this fraction becomes closer to one as the number of steps increases .",
    "as one can easily verify , a higher number of averages means that the fraction of a given term which is added at each partial sum approaches @xmath404 slower .    it can be proved that @xmath405 is stronger than @xmath406 , meaning that if a series can be summed according to @xmath406 then it can also be summed ( to the same value ) according to @xmath405 . in general ,",
    "cesro summation is linear in the series , regular ( it is stronger than the usual criterion for convergent series ) and stable ( if one removes the first term one gets a summable series which differs from the original one in this term ) .",
    "let us next consider abel criterion , which defines the value of a series @xmath401 as @xmath407 as long as the r.h.s",
    ".  converges for @xmath408 and the limit exists .",
    "note that this method coincides with a heat - kernel type regularization based on the cutoff function @xmath409 if we define @xmath410 .",
    "it can be shown that abel criterion is linear , stable and stronger than cesro criterion .",
    "for example , taking the limit @xmath411 in the convergent expansions @xmath412",
    "\\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}&=1 - 2x+3x^2-\\ldots\\\\[2 mm ]    \\frac{1-x}{(1+x)^3}&=1 - 4x+9x^2-\\ldots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one obtains the same values as in , and .",
    "finally , let us consider borel summation , which is stronger than abel criterion .",
    "to understand borel summation it is convenient to write @xmath413 and then formally interchange the sum with the integral to define @xmath414 one can verify that borel summation also gives the values in , and .",
    "the strength of this method can be understood in the divergent series @xmath415 , for positive @xmath295 .",
    "borel summation readily gives @xmath416 which leads to the result @xmath417 the importance of expression is that it indicates that a divergent series which is borel summable might occur in a physical problem as the result of expanding a non - perturbative expression .",
    "in general , a series @xmath418 is borel summable only if @xmath419 converges in some neighbourhood of the origin to some function @xmath420 that can be analytically extended to the positive real axis .",
    "then @xmath418 is defined as the integral @xmath421 , as long as this integral exists .",
    "in fact , under certain assumptions on analyticity and on the decrease of the remainder , watson s theorem states that an asymptotic series uniquely determines the sum in terms of an integral of borel s type @xcite .",
    "it it interesting to apply this definition to expressions and for the effective action of an electron / positron system in constant magnetic and electric backgrounds , respectively . in the purely magnetic case",
    ", the function @xmath420 is given by @xmath422 , which is analytic in a neighbourhood of the positive real axis and upon integration in @xmath9 leads to an alternating series ( in powers of @xmath423 ) for the effective action which is borel summable .",
    "on the contrary , for the purely electric case , @xmath420 is given by the function @xmath424 , which has infinitely many simple poles in the positive real axis and , if integrated in @xmath9 , leads instead to a divergent series ( in powers of @xmath425 ) of positive terms . in the presence of singularities",
