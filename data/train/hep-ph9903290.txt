    "the @xmath0 transition form factors@xcite @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and their multipole counterparts @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in nuclear and elementary particle physics are very important in nuclear and elementary particle physics because they provide a basis for testing theories of effective quark forces or production models .",
    "* they are especially important in the understanding of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) models@xcite involving gluon exchange mechanisms , tensor interactions , or possible hybrid baryonic states ; * they are important in enhanced quark models in which the transition form factors may be calculated as a function of @xmath6 ; in electroproduction and photoproduction processes ; in symmetry schemes such as su(6 ) and u(6,6 ) , and melosh transformations ; in bag models ; in dispersion relation and bethe - salpeter approaches ; in current algebra baryon sum rules ; and in nonperturbative methods such as lattice qcd , qcd sum rules , and algebraic formulations . *",
    "the fundamental reason that the transition form factors are such good qcd probes lies in the fact that in many quark , symmetry , and potential models , @xmath3 and/or @xmath15 are identically zero thus giving rise to pure magnetic dipole @xmath12 transitions * in the nave quark model , it can be shown that the quantity @xmath16 ratio of the electric quadrupole moment to the magnetic dipole moment @xmath17 .",

    "most analyses predict the @xmath19 to be small and negative at small momentum transfer , however a recent analysis@xcite extracted the value @xmath20 @xmath21 . subsequently , another even more recent analysis@xcitepredicts that @xmath22 at the maximum of the @xmath7  resonance and @xmath23 when background scattering amplitude contributions are taken into consideration . * clearly , the capability of any particular theoretical model ( including ours ) to predict accurately and precisely non - zero @xmath18 values of the right sign and magnitude for particular values of @xmath6 in agreement with experiment is critical .",
    "as has been noted , the @xmath18 ratio is especially effective for testing effective quark forces such as occur in qcd one - gluon exchange tensor interactions , various types of enhanced quark models , symmetry schemes such as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , melosh transformations , dispersion relations and sum rules ( where the @xmath26 always plays an important role ) .      *",
