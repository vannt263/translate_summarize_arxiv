    "four - neutrino ( @xmath4 ) models , involving the three known active states @xmath5 plus one hypothetical sterile state ( @xmath6 ) , are being intensively studied in the context of the current neutrino phenomenology , since they can accommodate ( through three independent mass square differences ) the three sources of evidence for @xmath2 flavor oscillations coming from atmospheric , solar , and accelerator neutrino experiments . in particular , @xmath4 spectra with mass eigenstates organized in two doublets ( 2 + 2 models ) seem to be favored by world neutrino data @xcite .",
    "updated reviews on such @xmath4 models and on their phenomenology can be found , e.g. , in @xcite , to which the reader is referred for an extended bibliography and for details that are not repeated in this work .    according to the conventional wisdom ,",
    "2 + 2 models are often assumed to imply , for the solar and atmospheric oscillation channels , either    @xmath7    or    @xmath8    in addition to inter - doublet @xmath9 oscillations with small amplitude , required to explain the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) signal @xcite .",
    "such simplifying assumptions are challenged by the recent super - kamiokande ( sk ) observations , which tend to disfavor ( dominant ) oscillations into @xmath6 of both atmospheric muon neutrinos ( at @xmath10 c.l .",
    "@xcite ) and solar electron neutrinos ( at @xmath11 c.l . , in combination with world solar @xmath2 data @xcite ) .",
    "the macro experiment also disfavors atmospheric @xmath1 oscillations ( at @xmath11 c.l .",
    "however , it seems premature to rule out the sterile neutrino hypothesis on the basis of the present information only @xcite : on the one hand , past experience on global data fits has shown that , sometimes , hypotheses rejected ( accepted ) at 95% or 99% c.l .",
    "can surprisingly revive ( die ) ; on the other hand , the underlying @xmath4 oscillation pattern might be more complicated @xcite than assumed in eqs .",
    "( [ mutau],[es ] ) or ( [ mus],[etau ] ) .",
    "in particular , instead of having decoupled active and sterile oscillation channels , one might have mixed ( active+sterile ) flavor transitions of the kind @xcite    @xmath12    where the states @xmath13 , as discussed later in more detail , represent linear ( orthogonal ) combinations of @xmath14 and @xmath6 through a mixing angle @xmath15 ,    @xmath16    the oscillation modes  ( [ mu+],[e- ] ) represent generalizations of both modes ( [ mutau],[es ] ) and ( [ mus],[etau ] ) , to which they reduce for @xmath17 and 1 , respectively . for generic values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the final states in atmospheric @xmath19 and solar @xmath3 flavor transitions are linear combinations of @xmath6 and @xmath14 , with coefficients to be constrained by experiments .    in this work ,",
    "we quantitatively study atmospheric four - neutrino oscillations in the context of 2 + 2 spectra , for unconstrained values of @xmath20 .",
    "it is shown that the state @xmath21 ( into which @xmath19 oscillates ) can have a sizable @xmath6 component , which is testable through high - energy atmospheric muon data .",
    "our atmospheric @xmath2 results are also qualitatively compared with recent @xmath4 solutions to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , which are compatible with a large @xmath6 component of @xmath22 .",
    "it is shown that both solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are consistent with sizable flavor transitions to a sterile state .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the theoretical @xmath4 framework , and in sec .",
    "iii we show the corresponding graphical representation of the parameter space .",
    "section  iv reports a preliminary discussion of the sk experimental information , while sec .",
    "v is devoted to a thorough sk atmospheric @xmath2 data analysis , from which we derive constraints on @xmath4 mass - mixing parameters .",
    "their consistency with solar neutrino data is discussed in sec .",
    "remarks on alternative @xmath4 scenarios are made in sec .",
    "finally , conclusions and perspectives are reported in sec .",
    "while this work was being completed , our attention was brought to the paper @xcite , where @xmath4 solutions to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly have also been worked out .",
    "the @xmath4 scenario considered in @xcite contains two additional parameters as compared with ours ( a mixing angle @xmath23 and a cp violation phase @xmath24 @xcite ) , and most of the results shown refer to such parameters , so that a direct comparison with our results is difficult . however , we agree with @xcite on some general features , namely , that atmospheric @xmath19 can have a large transition amplitude to @xmath6 ( in addition to @xmath0 ) , and that such transitions are consistent with solar neutrino data .",
    "in this section we define the theoretical @xmath4 framework and the notation used in our analysis .",
    "we also motivate a few data - driven assumptions , which considerably simplify both the analysis and the understanding of the solar and atmospheric @xmath2 oscillations .",
    "we order the neutrino flavor and mass eigenstates in column vectors as @xmath25 respectively ( @xmath26  transpose ) .",
    "such vectors are related by a unitary mixing matrix @xmath27 , @xmath28    the matrix of squared neutrino masses ( in the @xmath29 basis ) is defined as @xmath30 where the term @xmath31 reminds that the overall mass scale @xmath32 is unconstrained , as far as oscillation experiments are concerned .",
    "we define three independent mass square differences , phenomenologically related to the evidence for oscillations coming from solar , atmospheric , and lsnd experiments ,    @xmath33    with the above definitions , the neutrino evolution equation in the flavor basis , @xmath34 is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath35 where the first ( kinematical ) term @xcite depends on the neutrino energy @xmath36 , and the second ( dynamical ) term @xcite depends on the neutrino weak interactions with background electrons ( with density @xmath37 ) and neutrons ( with density @xmath38 ) in matter .",
    "motivated by the current @xmath4 oscillation phenomenology ( see @xcite and references therein ) , we assume that the mass eigenstates are organized in two doublets ( 2 + 2 spectrum ) , @xmath39 with three widely different mass squared differences , @xmath40    figure  1 shows our reference mass spectrum , with a lower `` solar neutrino doublet '' @xmath41 , and an upper `` atmospheric neutrino doublet '' @xmath42 , separated by a relatively large lsnd mass gap .",
    "other phenomenologically allowed 2 + 2 spectra can be obtained by interchanging the two doublets ( @xmath43 ) , as well as the two states in a doublet ( @xmath44 , or @xmath45 , or both ) .",
    "we anticipate that , under the approximations discussed below , the oscillation physics in such alternative 2 + 2 spectra is equivalent ( under appropriate changes of variables ) to that in the spectrum of fig .  1 . therefore , our reference choice in fig .",
    "1 does not represent a limitation , as far as 2 + 2 spectra are considered .",
    "we also anticipate that , under the same approximations , cp violation effects turn out to be unobservably small in current experiments , so that the mixing matrix @xmath27 can be effectively taken as real , @xmath46    further assumptions about the mixing matrix @xmath27 can be adopted by comparing positive disappearance results at the mass scale @xmath47 ( solar @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( atmospheric @xmath50 ) with negative disappearance results at the mass scale @xmath51 in short - baseline accelerators ( no @xmath50 ) and reactors ( no @xmath48 ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such results imply that the @xmath19 component of the atmospheric doublet @xmath42 must be large to explain the atmospheric @xmath19 anomaly , but must be small in the other doublet @xmath41 , in order to avoid large @xmath51-driven @xmath50 oscillations at short - baseline accelerators .",
    "analogously , the @xmath3 component of the solar doublet @xmath41 must be large to explain the solar @xmath3 deficit , but it must be small in the other doublet @xmath42 , in order to avoid large @xmath51-driven @xmath48 oscillations at reactors .",
    "therefore , one can take @xmath52    some remarks on the above two assumptions are in order . in @xmath4 models embedding lsnd ,",
    "( [ umu12 ] ) and ( [ ue34 ] ) must be slightly violated  at the few permill level  in order to get a nonzero value for the small ( few permill ) lsnd @xmath9 oscillation amplitude , given by @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "a few permill violation makes little difference in the analysis of current solar and atmospheric neutrino data , and will be neglected in the following .",
    "one can not exclude , however , more general scenarios in which @xmath54 is taken close to the weakest upper limits allowed by accelerators ( of the order of ten percent @xcite ) and can thus play a nonnegligible phenomenological role @xcite .",
    "such scenarios are beyond the scope of the present work .    the simplifying assumptions ( [ umu12 ] ) and ( [ ue34 ] ) lead to a specific texture for the matrix @xmath27 , @xmath55 with the following implications . the state @xmath19 ( @xmath3 ) must be a linear combination of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and we have introduced two mixing angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( ranging in @xmath65 $ ] ) .",

    ", however , the favored values of @xmath49 are rather large [ @xmath190 ev@xmath172 ) , in contrast with the information coming from the @xmath166 ratio in fig .  6 .",

    "the slight preference for a nonzero value of @xmath105 at the point of minimum @xmath159 is intriguing , but not statistically significant , since the fit with @xmath106 ( pure @xmath0 oscillations , thin solid line ) is only slightly worse than the unconstrained fit ( thick solid line ) .    concerning the statistical interpretation of the results shown in fig .  8 ,",
    "some remarks are in order . in general",
    ", one can use the @xmath159 function for two complementary purposes @xcite : ( 1 ) to estimate the best - fit values of @xmath191 and their uncertainties ( _ parameter estimation _ ) ; or ( 2 ) to test the goodness - of - fit with some prior assumptions about @xmath191 ( _ hypothesis test _ ) . in the first approach ,",
    "the values of @xmath191 minimizing the @xmath159 function are taken as best estimates of the ( unknown ) true values of such parameters .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties are then obtained by allowing a shift in the @xmath159 function ( @xmath203 ) , with corresponding confidence levels determined by the number of free parameters in the model ( @xmath204 in our case ) . from this point of view , the case of pure @xmath1 oscillations , corresponding to @xmath205 in fig .",
    "8 , is reached only at 99.8% c.l . , and is thus strongly disfavored . in the second approach , one checks how well a specific hypothesis about the parameters fits the 55 sk data points , independently of the existence of a global @xmath159 minimum at some point in the parameter space .",
    "for instance , if order to test the _ a priori _ hypotheses of pure @xmath0 or pure @xmath1 oscillations , one should compare the absolute @xmath159 value with @xmath206 , the two free variables being @xmath49 and @xmath200 ( @xmath105 being fixed at 0 or 1 , respectively ) . from fig .",
    "8 , we then get that the probability of having a worse @xmath159 is 63% for @xmath106 ( pure @xmath0 oscillations , @xmath207 ) and 18% for @xmath107 ( @xmath208 ( pure @xmath1 oscillations , @xmath209 ) . therefore , although the pure sterile case is clearly disfavored _ in comparison _ with the pure active case , it is not ruled out _ a priori _ in our oscillation analysis .",
    "having clarified such statistical issues , we proceed to estimate the mass - mixing parameters @xmath191 by using the first approach , based on @xmath210 .    in fig .",
    "8 , all four cases show a preference for @xmath211 ev@xmath172 , which thus represents a very stable indication coming from the sk data , independently of the amplitude of the @xmath6 component . for the most general case ( unconstrained @xmath21 ) we obtain @xmath212 by taking @xmath213 for @xmath204 .",
    "figure  8 also gives gives indications about the parameter @xmath105 .",
    "the case @xmath106 ( thin solid line ) gives results comparable to the best fit for unconstrained @xmath105 ( thick solid line ) . the case of a fifty - fifty admixture of @xmath6 and @xmath14 in @xmath21 ( @xmath199 , dotted line ) provides a fit that , although worse than for pure @xmath0 , is still acceptable ( its minimum @xmath159 being only four units above the absolute minimum ) .",
    "however , the quality of the fit worsen rapidly as @xmath21 gets closer to @xmath6 , the worst case being reached for pure @xmath1 oscillations ( dashed line ) . therefore , we expect to get an upper bound on @xmath105 from the analysis of the mixing parameters , which can be clearly represented in the triangle plot .",
    "figures  9 and 10 show the results of our analysis in the atmospheric triangle plot , for @xmath214 representative ( decreasing ) values of @xmath49 .",
    "the first three columns of triangles refer to the separate fits to sub - gev electrons and muons ( 10 + 10 bins ) , multi - gev electrons and muons ( 10 + 10 bins ) , and upward stopping and through - going muons ( 5 + 10 bins ) , while the fourth column refers to the total sk data sample ( 55 bins ) . for each column",
    ", we find the minimum @xmath159 from the fit to the corresponding data sample , and then present sections of the allowed volume at fixed values of @xmath49 for @xmath213 ( 90% c.l . , solid lines ) and @xmath215 ( 99% c.l . , dotted lines ) .",
    "it can be seen that the low - energy sg data are basically insensitive to @xmath105 , since they are consistent both with @xmath0 oscillations ( left side ) and with @xmath1 oscillations ( right side ) , as well as with any intermediate combination of the two oscillation channels .",
    "high - energy upgoing @xmath162 data are instead much more sensitive to the @xmath6 component through matter effects , which increase both with energy and with @xmath105 , and tend to suppress the @xmath162 deficit @xcite .",
    "large matter effects appear to be disfavored by the upgoing muon data , the rightmost part of the triangle being excluded at 90% c.l .",
    "the multi - gev data cover an intermediate energy range and are not as constraining as the upgoing muons ; however , they also show a tendency to disfavor a large @xmath6 component .",
    "this tendency is strengthened in the global combination of data ( fourth column ) , leading to the upper bound @xmath216 which clearly disfavors pure or quasi - pure @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "in particular , from our figs .  9 and 10 we derive that pure @xmath1 oscillations ( @xmath107 ) are excluded at @xmath217 c.l . , consistently with the sk analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the bound ( [ xibound ] ) still allows intermediate cases of combined active+sterile oscillations with a sizable @xmath6 component .",
    "for instance , one can not exclude that the sterile neutrino channel may have the same amplitude as the active one @xmath218 , or may even be dominant ( e.g. , @xmath219 , corresponding to @xmath220 ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath49 in its upper range ( e.g. , @xmath221 ev@xmath172 in fig .",
    "9 ) , a subdominant @xmath6 component actually helps in the global fit to sk data , leading to a 90% c.l .",
    "allowed region which does not touch the left side of the triangle ( corresponding to the pure @xmath0 channel ) .",
    "figures  9 and 10 also provide bounds on the other mixing parameter @xmath200 , which governs the relative amount of @xmath19 and @xmath21 on the atmospheric neutrino states @xmath56 and @xmath57 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ numu],[nu++ ] ) and fig .  2 ] , and thus the overall amplitude of @xmath131 oscillations . from figs .  9 and 10 we derive @xmath222 which favors @xmath131 oscillations with nearly maximal amplitude , as one expects from the observation of nearly maximal average suppression ( @xmath223 ) of upgoing mg muons .",
    "there is a slight asymmetry of the allowed regions with respect to @xmath175 , which reflects the relative change of sign of vacuum and matter terms in eq .",
    "( [ calha ] ) when passing from the first to the second octant .",
    "figures  8 , 9 , and 10 demonstrate that , on the basis of present sk data on the zenith distributions of leptons induced by atmospheric neutrinos , pure @xmath1 oscillations are strongly disfavored , but one can not exclude mixed active - sterile @xmath131 oscillations with @xmath224 , provided that the partial amplitude of the sterile channel is @xmath225 [ eq .",
    "( [ xibound ] ) ] . since such bound is dominated by high - energy muons , it is important to understand how such data can improve the sensitivity to @xmath105 in the future .",
    "figure  11 shows the zenith distributions of upward through - going muons at maximal @xmath100 mixing @xmath226 for @xmath195 ( left panel ) , @xmath227 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath197 ( right panel ) .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) histograms refer to @xmath228 ev@xmath172 ( @xmath229 ev@xmath172 ) , the sign of @xmath49 being irrelevant at maximal mixing . from left to right , @xmath105 increases and matter effects also grow with it , producing an increasing modulation of the zenith distributions .",
    "the modulation , which is very strong for the oscillation probability at fixed energies ( not shown ) , is largely smeared out in fig .",
    "11 by integration over the energy spectrum and , to a lesser extent , by the presence of both @xmath2 and @xmath230 ( with opposite matter terms ) in the atmospheric neutrino flux .",

    "11 ) , the large scatter of central values and the still large error bars prevent a clear discrimination of the theoretical distributions in the left and middle panels , which anyway appear to provide a better fit than in right panel .",

    "11 . in conclusion",

    "solar neutrino oscillations with both active and sterile states have been recently investigated in @xcite , whose results can be interpreted , in our framework , through the identification @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath235 . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that there is a continuous set of solutions to the solar neutrino problem for unconstrained @xmath105 , ranging from pure `` active oscillation solutions '' ( @xmath107 ) to pure `` sterile oscillation solutions '' ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath107 all the usual solutions to the solar neutrino problem are present , either at small @xmath64 mixing ( matter - enhanced solution ) or at large @xmath64 mixing ( matter - enhanced solution at low or high @xmath47 , or vacuum solutions ) . for decreasing values of @xmath105 ,",
    "all the solutions tend to shrink ; however , the large mixing ( lm ) ones ( vacuum or matter - enhanced ) eventually disappear for @xmath236@xmath237 , while the small mixing ( sm ) solution still survives ( at @xmath10 c.l . ) even for @xmath106 .",
    "such behavior is qualitatively reported in fig .",
    "12 , through the triangular representation of the parameter space .",
    "the plot is only qualitative , since the detailed behavior of any solution depends both on the confidence level adopted and on the specific value chosen for @xmath47 , whose complete scan is beyond the scope of this paper .    in fig .",
    "12 , the allowed region at large mixing ( @xmath238 close to @xmath239 ) , which has the maximum likelihood at @xmath107 ( pure active oscillations , right side of the triangle ) , gradually shrinks when @xmath105 decreases and eventually disappears .",
    "the allowed region at small mixing ( @xmath238 close to 0 ) covers instead the whole @xmath105 range .    as discussed in secs .",
    "ii and iii , the solar and atmospheric solutions are coupled through the common angle @xmath15",
    ". such coupling can be visualized by putting the solar and atmospheric triangles on top of each other , as shown in fig .  4 .",

    ".    figure  13 shows , in grey , the regions globally allowed by the combination of solar and atmospheric @xmath2 data , assuming the sm solution to the solar @xmath2 problem . the fact that atmospheric @xmath2 data put an upper bound on @xmath105 ( as quantitatively discussed through figs .  9 and 10 ) implies that also the fraction of the sm solar @xmath2 solution at large @xmath105 is excluded . however , there is still a continuous range of global solutions for @xmath240 , having a sizable @xmath6 component for both solar and atmospheric @xmath2 oscillations",
    ". therefore atmospheric @xmath2 data `` cut '' a fraction of the sm solution to the solar @xmath2 problem , but the combination still allows solutions involving active+sterile neutrino oscillations for both atmospheric and solar neutrinos .",
    "the opposite happens for the lm solution to the solar neutrino problem . in this case",
    ", solar neutrino data cut the `` small @xmath105 '' part of the atmospheric allowed region , as shown in fig .",
    "14 , and the globally allowed solutions ( grey inner regions ) represent genuine active+sterile oscillations , which never reduce to the pure active or pure sterile subcases ( the sides of the triangles ) . in particular , the points denoted by stars in fig .",
    "14 represent a peculiar solution ( which might be dubbed `` fourfold maximal mixing '' ) , corresponding to maximal mixing of @xmath241 with @xmath242 ( @xmath199 ) , maximal mixing of @xmath243 with @xmath244 ( @xmath175 ) , and maximal mixing of @xmath245 with @xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) . in this case",
    ", both solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are equally distributed among the active and sterile channels .    in conclusion",
    ", it turns out that , at least qualitatively , @xmath4 scenarios with mixed active+sterile transitions for both solar and atmospheric neutrinos are allowed by the combination of world oscillation data , with different mixing patterns dictated by the solution assumed for the solar neutrino problem ( either small or large mixing ) .",
    "consistency between atmospheric and solar neutrino data in @xmath4 models has also been recently found in an independent and somewhat different analysis @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hypothesis of a fourth , sterile neutrino is still compatible with present data and needs further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "such results clearly demonstrate that the two - flavor approximations often used to analyze solar or atmospheric neutrinos data ( in terms of either pure active or pure sterile oscillations ) are , in general , not appropriate to explore the full parameter space allowed by @xmath4 models .",
    "our @xmath4 formalism and triangular representations can also be usefully applied to explore the @xmath1 discovery potential in long baseline accelerator experiments , as shown for the minos experiment in @xcite .",
    "the standard arguments disfavoring 3 + 1 spectra ( triplet+singlet ) with respect to 2 + 2 spectra ( two doublets ) in the interpretation of the current @xmath4 oscillation phenomenology @xcite appear to be somewhat weakened @xcite in light of the most recent lsnd data @xcite , and should be perhaps revisited quantitatively . here",
    "we make just a few qualitative comments on the mixing pattern that is likely to emerge in 3 + 1 models characterized by a triplet @xmath248 ( mainly responsible for solar and atmospheric oscillations ) and by a `` loner '' state @xmath57 ( mainly responsible for lsnd oscillations ) .",
    "the absence ( or weak occurrence , as in lsnd ) of oscillations in all channels probed by short - baseline reactor and accelerator experiments is consistent with @xmath57 being close to a flavor eigenstate .",
    "the dominant flavor of @xmath57 can not be @xmath3 ( @xmath19 ) , otherwise the disappearance pattern of solar @xmath3 ( atmospheric @xmath19 ) would remain unexplained . moreover , if it were @xmath249 , then the triplet @xmath248 would approximately be a linear combination of @xmath250 , and thus the atmospheric @xmath19 oscillation partner should be either @xmath3 ( excluded ) or @xmath6 ( disfavored at @xmath251 c.l . ) or a linear combination of @xmath3 and @xmath6 ( presumably disfavored ) .",
    "therefore , the favored option for 3 + 1 spectra seems to imply @xmath252 , with ( at least ) a small subdominant component of @xmath19 and @xmath3 in @xmath57 , necessary to drive lsnd oscillations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "mixing are currently being investigated , see @xcite . ]    assuming @xmath252 in 3 + 1 models , the triplet states @xmath248 would then approximately be linear combinations of @xmath5 , and the triplet phenomenology of solar and atmospheric neutrinos would practically become equivalent to that of a standard framework with three active neutrinos . such @xmath253 framework has been worked out in detail in previous papers @xcite , where the reader can find the corresponding constraints on the mass - mixing parameters . in conclusion , it seems that the emerging mixing pattern for the 3 + 1 spectrum implies , up to small `` lsnd perturbations '' , an effective three - neutrino phenomenology for solar and atmospheric oscillations . in this case , it becomes important to study how well one can experimentally discriminate such @xmath4 option from pure @xmath253 oscillations .",
    "in the context of 2 + 2 neutrino models , we have thoroughly analyzed the sk atmospheric data on the zenith distributions of lepton events , assuming the coexistence of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations , with a smooth interpolation between such two subcases .",
    "we have shown that , although the data disfavor oscillations in the pure @xmath1 channel , one can not exclude their presence _ in addition _ to @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "high energy muon data appear to be crucial to assess the relative amplitude of the active and sterile oscillation channels for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we have also shown , in a qualitative way , that mixed active+sterile oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos are compatible with analogous oscillations of solar neutrinos , with different mixing pattern emerging from different choices for the solar @xmath2 solutions .",
    "such results indicate that the solar and atmospheric neutrino phenomenology can not be simply embedded in the usual two - family scenarios involving oscillations into either pure active or pure sterile states , and call for an extended @xmath4 framework involving combined solutions .",
    "further directions to improve and constrain our present results might involve , on the one hand , a quantitative , global analysis of _ world _ neutrino oscillation data and , on the other hand , the inclusion of non - oscillatory data which have not been considered in this work , such as those coming from astrophysics and cosmology , and from direct neutrino mass measurements .",
