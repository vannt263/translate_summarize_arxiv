    "a midpoint algebra is a pair @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a set and @xmath2 a binary operation satisfying the following axioms : @xmath3 the main example , which attracted our attention to this study , is the unit interval @xmath4 $ ] with @xmath5 .",
    "the category of midpoint algebras is not a maltsev category .",
    "indeed , the usual order relation on the unit interval , with the arithmetic mean as above , is clearly a subalgebra of the product @xmath6\\times [ 0,1]$ ] , which is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric , contradicting the well known characterization of maltsev categories @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the category of midpoint algebras does have some interesting properties weaker than those of maltsev categories , namely that each object admits at most one internal monoid structure for each choice of a unit . to illustrate this aspect we use another example .",
    "let @xmath0 be the midpoint algebra with @xmath70,1]$ ] , the set of positive real numbers smaller or equal than one , and the operation@xmath8 it is clear that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive real numbers then @xmath11 is also positive ; it is also easy to see that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are less or equal than one then @xmath11 is less or equal than one .",
    "a simple way to see it is to observe that the condition @xmath12 is equivalent to the condition@xmath13 hence the operation is well defined and it is easily checked that @xmath0 is a midpoint algebra .",
    "the diagram@xmath14^{m}&a&\\{1\\}\\ar[l]},\\ ] ] with @xmath15 is an internal monoid .",
    "this internal monoid structure is uniquely determined by the unit element @xmath16 and there is no internal monoid structure for any other choice of a unit element .",
    "moreover , it is not an internal group as , for example , @xmath17 has no inverse since the equation @xmath18 has no solution in the real numbers .    while proving some of the results presented in this paper , we have observed that , in many cases , the idempotency law could be dealt with in a separate way .",
    "this suggested to us the study of the more general structure of commutative cancellative medial magmas , which , for simplicity , we will refer to as ccm - magmas .",
    "the medial law has been widely studied over the last three quarter of a century . in the context of magmas ( formerly known as groupoids )",
    "this law was also referred to as bisymmetric , entropic or transposition , among other names .",
    "it has been studied either from an algebraic point of view or from a more geometrical perspective , see for example @xcite .",
    "the open - closed unit interval @xmath190,1]$ ] used in the example above has several other important structures of ccm - magma : that of a midpoint algebra ( with the arithmetic mean ) , and that of a commutative monoid with cancellation ( with the usual multiplication ) , resulting in an interplay between different ccm - magmas on the same set",
    ". the study of such interactions is certainly worthy .",
    "nevertheless , for the moment , we dedicate our attention to some important aspects of the internal structures in the category of ccm - magmas , such as internal monoid , internal group and internal relation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec preliminaries ] recalls some categorical notations and concepts such as the one of an internal monoid ; section [ sec ccm - magmas ] introduces the category of ccm - magmas , gives some examples , and some useful lemmas are proven ; section [ sec maltsev ] observes that the category of ccm - magmas is weakly maltsev and characterizes the existence of an internal monoid structure on a given object , for every choice of a unit element ; section [ sec monoids ] explores this property further by considering the notions of @xmath20-expansive , @xmath20-symmetric and homogeneous ccm - magmas ( a short list of simple examples and counter - examples is also presented at the end of the section ) ; and finally , section [ sec relations ] studies some properties of internal relations , namely symmetry , transitivity , reflexivity and difunctionality , which are not visible in the case of maltsev categories .",
    "the basic notions and notations from category theory used in this paper can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "let us just recall a few of them .",
    "if @xmath21 is any category with finite limits , an internal monoid in @xmath21 is a diagram of the shape@xmath14^{m}&a&1\\ar[l]_{e}}\\ ] ] in which @xmath1 is any object in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 are morphisms in @xmath21 , @xmath23 denotes the terminal object and the following diagram is commutative ( where @xmath24 denotes the unique morphism from @xmath1 to the terminal object @xmath23).@xmath25^{1_a\\times m}\\ar[d]_{m\\times 1_a}&a^2\\ar[d]_{m}&a\\ar@{=}[ld]\\ar[l]_{\\langle e!_a,1_a\\rangle}\\ar[d]^{\\langle 1_a , e!_a\\rangle}\\\\a^2\\ar[r]^{m}&a&a^2\\ar[l]_{m}}\\ ] ] an internal monoid @xmath26 is an internal group ( see for example the appendix in @xcite ) if and only if the diagram @xmath27^{\\pi_2}\\ar[l]_{m } & a}\\ ] ] is a product diagram ( the morphism @xmath28 is the canonical second projection ) , in other words , for every two morphisms @xmath29 there exists a unique morphism , represented as @xmath30 , from @xmath31 to @xmath1 such that @xmath32 the inverse of a generalized element @xmath33 is clearly @xmath34 with @xmath35 the unit element .",
    "this is simply another way to say that there is a morphism @xmath36 such that @xmath37    this paper restricts itself to quasi - varieties of universal algebra @xcite , that is , categories in which the objects are sets equipped with an arbitrary family of finite - arity operations , satisfying a collection of axioms which may be either expressed as identities or as implications .",
    "all the results to be proven about conditions of uniqueness are easily generalized to a category with a faithful functor into the category of sets , preserving finite limits . however , the results involving existence conditions depend on the context and do not necessarily hold in general .",
    "the notion of internal ccm - magma is also a natural one to be considered .",
    "it would be interesting , for example , to study topological ccm - magmas , i.e. ccm - magmas internal to the category of topological spaces @xcite .",
    "a congruence on an object @xmath1 is a subalgebra of @xmath38 , which , if considered as a relation , is reflexive , transitive and symmetric ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". we will also consider difunctional relations : a relation @xmath39 is difunctional if the implication @xmath40holds for all @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "a maltsev category is characterized by the property that every reflexive internal relation is a congruence relation , or equivalently , by the property that every internal relation is difunctional ( @xcite see also @xcite ) . as we will see",
    ", this property does not hold in the categories we are considering",
    ". however , these have a weaker property : some types of reflexive internal relations are still congruences , and some types of internal relations are automatically difunctional .",
    "a ccm - magma ( commutative cancellative medial magma ) may be obtained from a midpoint algebra simply by not requiring the idempotency axiom .    [ middle algebra ] a _ ccm - magma _ is an algebraic structure @xmath0 with a binary operation @xmath2 satisfying the following axioms :    1 .",

    "the third axiom has an important consequence illustrated in the following proposition .",
    "[ prop1 ] if @xmath46 are two morphisms of ccm - magmas , then the map @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 is also a morphism of ccm - magmas .",
    "the result is an immediate consequence of the axiom ( m3 ) .",
    "the result of proposition [ prop1 ] stands even if commutativity is not included ( see also @xcite , theorem 12.8 ) ; in this case , among all medial - like identities studied in @xcite , ( m3 ) is the most appropriate in proving this result .",
    "in fact , as we will see in section [ sec maltsev ] , even the weakly maltsev property may be proven without commutativity .",
    "this paper considers the commutativity axiom . in a future work",
    "we will investigate a more general structure where ( m1 ) is not included .",
    "a simple variation of the previous result shows that for any two ccm - magmas @xmath31 and @xmath49 , there is a canonical morphism from product into co - product @xmath50 sending each pair @xmath51 to the element @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 the canonical inclusions into the co - product .",
    "more generally , for any two given morphisms @xmath55 and @xmath56 there is an induced morphism , say @xmath57 , even thought there are no canonical injections to insert @xmath31 and @xmath49 in @xmath58 .",
