    "as was first noted by polyakov @xcite , there exists a deeply rooted analogy between four - dimensional yang - mills theories and two - dimensional sigma models .",
    "indeed the latter can serve as perfect theoretical laboratories to test methods and approaches developed for solving the problems of these far richer and more complicated theories .",
    "this is particularly true for the supersymmetric extensions of these theories @xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to formulate such theories on the lattice and a greal deal of progress has been made in this area recently for models possessing extended supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "these formulations all rely on the idea of _ twisting _  a technique pioneered by witten @xcite in the context of topological field theory .",
    "these twisted formulations possess a scalar nilpotent supercharge @xmath1 , which with care , may often be preserved on the lattice .",
    "this symmetry can help prevent relevant susy breaking counterterms from appearing in the effective action and thus may avoid the fine tuning problems of generic discretizations of supersymmetric models . as was discussed in simon catterall s talk in this conference the twisted action is typically @xmath1 exact and in the case of the 2d sigma model takes the form @xmath2 where the action of the twisted charge on the fields is given by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a set of commuting fields which act as coordinates on some @xmath5-dim target space with metric @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 are scalar grassmann fields , @xmath8 are vector grassman fields and @xmath9 are another commuting vector fields .",
    "if we carry out the @xmath1-variation and integrate out @xmath10 we find @xmath11 to generate a kinetic term for the @xmath12 fields it is necessary to choose @xmath13 finally to make contact with usual sigma model we need to impose _ self - duality _ conditions on the vector fields in the model .",
    "this amounts to replacing @xmath14 by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a covariantly constant matrix @xmath18 .",
    "manifolds possessing such a tensor field are termed khler .",
    "it can be shown that the resultant model can we written in complex coordinates as @xmath19",
    "it is trivial to see that the action is invariant under the twisted supersymmetry when i replace the continuum derivatives by symmetric finite differences , as the continuum q - symmetry makes no reference to derivatives of the fields .",
    "however the kernel of the ( free ) lattice dirac operator constructed this way contains both fermionic and bosonic doubles which have no continuum interpretation . to remove",
    "these we need to add a wilson term to the lattice action .",
    "of course it is not obvious that the addition of such a term is compatible with the topological symmetry in the case of a curved target space .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown that indeed it is possible to add potential terms to the twisted sigma models while maintaining the topological symmetry .",
    "the possible terms are @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is a holomorphic killing vector and @xmath22 an arbitrary parameter .",
    "a wilson term would correspond to the choice @xmath23 where @xmath24 many khler manifolds possess such a holomorphic killing vector ( for example the @xmath25 theories ) . actually @xmath26 is no longer zero in such models but yields a diffeomorphism along the killing vector . for a reparametrization invariant continuum action",
    "this will be an exact symmetry .",
    "however on the lattice ( where exact reparametrization invariance is broken ) it will yield a symmetry breaking term of @xmath27 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite such a term will not affect the renormalization of the model and we expect that the model will flow to a continuum theory with full @xmath0 susy in the continuum limit .",
    "the usual @xmath28 supersymmetric sigma model is perhaps the simplest example of a model with khler target space which may be realized as a twisted model . in this case",
    "the metric , connection and curvature are easily verified to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the supersymmetric lattice action including wilson terms takes the form @xmath31\\overline{\\lambda}\\nonumber \\\\   & & -\\left .",
    "\\frac{1}{8\\rho^2}\\eta i[m_w-\\frac{2\\bar{u}}{\\rho}(\\delta_+^su)+c.c]\\overline{\\eta } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to proceed further it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary field @xmath32 to remove the quartic fermion term .",
    "explicitly we employ the identity @xmath33 where @xmath5 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "thus the partition function of the lattice model can be cast in the form @xmath34 where the action is now given by @xmath35 \\label{o3act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the anticommuting fields are assembled into dirac spinors @xmath36 and the dirac operator @xmath37 in the chiral basis is @xmath38 @xmath39 where the covariant derivative is modified to include a coupling to the auxiliary field @xmath32 @xmath40 to simulate this model we have to reproduce the fermion determinant arising after integrating out the anticommuting fields .",
    "this leads to an effective action of the form ( we observe the determinant to be positive definite ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the local bosonic pieces of the action and we have shown the dependence on coupling @xmath43 explicitly .",
    "we have employed a langevin algorithm with a stochastic fermion force estimator to represent this determinant . in this case physical quantities exhibit systematic errors of order the step size @xmath44 .    using the invariance of the action under the twisted @xmath1",
    ", one can easily show that the partition function should be _ independent _ of the coupling constant @xmath43",
    ". a stringent test of this @xmath43 independence of @xmath45 is gotten by measuring the expectation value of @xmath46 .",
    "it should be clear that @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the number of lattice sites .",
    "the results are given in fig.[action ] which shows data for @xmath49 from runs at a variety of couplings @xmath43 for a lattice of size 12x12 for different time steps @xmath50 .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the theoretical prediction above .",
    "notice that the small deviations from unity at small @xmath43 s are due to small q - symmetry breaking associated with the wilson term , whereas those for large @xmath43 s are due to the systematic errors ( @xmath44 ) in the langevin algorithm .",
    "further numerical studies of ward identities and other important quantities are underway",
    ". they should give us a better understanding of the theory and the possibility of breaking of the supersymmetry .",
