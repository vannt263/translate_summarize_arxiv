    "during recent years the study of hqet , the effective theory of qcd expanded in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass , has considerably enlarged our understanding of low  energy qcd ( cf .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "being successfully applied to a number of exclusive decay processes of heavy ",
    "light systems containing one heavy quark and one or two light quarks , it likewise supplies us with a number of relations between static properties of such systems like the particle spectrum and leptonic decay constants . nevertheless , the question of the correct definition of the heavy quark mass @xmath4 , the expansion parameter of hqet , has played only a minor rle in the tremendous number of publications dealing with that theory .",
    "when green functions in full qcd are matched to those in hqet , one has to decide whether to identify @xmath4 with the _ pole mass _ or with the renormalization scheme ",
    "dependent _ current mass _ of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "admittedly the question of which mass to use seems a rather academical one from the viewpoint of phenomenology as long as the mass enters explicitly only in inverse powers and implicitly in the strong coupling constant in the matching coefficients . yet",
    "the field of applications of hqet has expanded again and now likewise encloses semileptonic inclusive decays of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "two important statements about inclusive decays could be obtained : first , in leading order they are essentially free quark decays , and second , the leading corrections to the free quark decay are of order @xmath5 .",
    "these results stimulated new determinations of the quark masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the ckm matrix element @xmath8 from the experimental measurements of the semileptonic branching ratios @xmath9 and @xmath10 , cf .",
    "refs .  @xcite .",
    "since in contrast to previous applications of hqet , the inclusive decay rate depends on the heavy quark mass in its fifth@xmath11 ( ! ) power , a careful analysis of the correct definition of the mass parameter is mandatory .",
    "in fact any _ positive _ power of the heavy mass originates from the matching of a qcd green function to a hqet green function , so it is naturally a running current mass which enters in this step . on the other hand",
    "the expansion parameter of the hqet green function equals the pole mass @xcite , whose precise definition has recently been investigated by braun and beneke and by bigi et al .",
    "it was found that due to renormalon effects any attempt to define the pole mass beyond a finite order in perturbation theory is plagued by an intrinsic uncertainty of order @xmath12 .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we analyse the rle of the mass parameter in the wilson coefficient obtained from the matching of qcd and hqet green functions . as a result",
    "we recover in the leading order of the @xmath13expansion the long  known renormalization scheme and scale  dependence of the parton model .",
    "we further argue that the ambiguity in the definition of the pole mass , which is the expansion parameter of hqet , does not affect a phenomenological analysis which uses the expansions in @xmath13 and @xmath14 only to a finite order . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the inclusive decay rates of d and b  mesons using the @xmath15 scheme .",
    "we determine the quark masses and @xmath8 in a manner that is very similar to what was done in refs .",
    "@xcite and get a value of @xmath8 that is by about 10% smaller than the results of refs .",
    "this difference results solely from the transition of the on  shell scheme to the @xmath15 scheme .",
    "special attention is paid to the correct determination of the renormalization scale  dependence .",
    "while it is huge in the inclusive rates itself , it mainly drops out in @xmath8 . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "hqet allows a systematic expansion of qcd observables in inverse powers of a heavy quark mass .",
    "it is founded on the fact that the long  distance strong interaction of a heavy quark with mass @xmath4 is independent of its spin and flavour in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "this heavy quark symmetry is violated by the finiteness of the heavy quark mass and by short  distance qcd interactions .",
    "the first correction is taken into account by including terms proportional to powers of @xmath13 , while the effect of hard gluons can be incorporated in a perturbation series in @xmath17 .",
    "usually these steps are treated independently : at first the heavy antiparticle field is integrated out in the path integral and the resulting expression is expanded in @xmath13 yielding a series of local terms in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "then green functions in qcd and hqet are matched at a scale @xmath18 at which both perturbative qcd and hqet are valid . in this step",
    "short  distance corrections are taken into account by calculating loop corrections to the matching coefficients . here",
    "one has to worry about the definition of the mass @xmath4 .",
    "the semileptonic inclusive decay rate discussed in sec .",
    "iii contains @xmath4 in the fifth power and the proper definition of @xmath4 is of significant phenomenological importance .",
    "a mass parameter in a physical observable calculated with the help of hqet can originate from two very different sources : consider the matching of a qcd green function @xmath19 to its hqet counterpart @xmath20 at some scale @xmath18 : @xmath21          \\label{matchmu}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ matchmu ] ) @xmath4 can enter the wilson coefficient @xmath22 , which comprises the short  distance interactions originating from scales larger than the matching scale @xmath23 .",
    "the inverse masses multiplying @xmath24 , however , is the expansion parameter of hqet multiplying the different orders of interaction operators in the hqet lagrangian .",
    "the mass @xmath4 in the wilson coefficient @xmath22 , which we will discuss first , is a short  distance quantiy and therefore clearly equals the _ running current mass _ @xmath25 in the renormalization scheme chosen for the calculation of @xmath26 .",
    "this fact becomes very transparent in the example of a qcd green function whose feynman graphs contain external heavy quark lines and internal lines corresponding to particles with masses @xmath27 : we first set @xmath28 and calculate the diagrams in the full standard model and in an effective field theory in which the heaviest internal particle is integrated out to obtain some wilson coefficient @xmath29 .",
    "whenever we cross a particle threshold in the renormalization group evolution of @xmath22 to lower energies we have to repeat this factorization , which successively puts the masses of all internal heavy particles into the wilson coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "they enter @xmath22 as running masses @xmath30 evaluated at scales @xmath31 .",
    "when we approach @xmath18 we match the green function in an effective qcd theory to a hqet green function as displayed in ( [ matchmu ] ) , which adds @xmath4 to the set of heavy masses appearing as arguments of @xmath22 .",
    "there is no point in treating this mass differently from the others in @xmath22 : the short  distance coefficient should not contain any information on the long  distance interaction , i.e.  whether the latter is encoded in a green function calculated in hqet or in some other effective theory of qcd .    in a physical observable calculated with the help of hqet _ positive _ powers of @xmath4",
    "obviously stem from the wilson coefficient . in spite of this",
    "the inclusive decay rate discussed in sec .",
    "iii is usually entirely expressed in terms of the pole mass . the leading term in the @xmath13expansion is known to coincide with the parton model result , which has been obtained in @xcite from an older qed calculation . in the latter an on  shell renormalization was used for the external fermion so that the result was expressed in terms of the pole mass .",
    "in qcd this scheme is not very adequate , because quarks are confined and their mass is not directly related to any observable .",
    "nevertheless , as long as one stays within the parton model , which does not distinguish between the heavy meson and the heavy quark , the on  shell scheme is as good as any other scheme , to which one can easily pass by expressing the pole mass in the result by the corresponding current mass . by using hqet",
    ", however , we want to estimate corrections to the parton model result stemming from the binding of the heavy quark in the meson , and the correct tool to use is wilson s operator product expansion ( [ matchmu ] ) .    in the case of the inclusive decay rate",
    "the standard model diagrams to be calculated for the left hand side of ( [ matchmu ] ) are the heavy quark self  energy graphs with the light quark and the lepton pair in the intermediate state .",
    "its imaginary part determines the desired rate in the parton model . in general",
    "one would like to include renormalization group improvement between the scales @xmath32 and @xmath18 and would match the standard model diagram first at @xmath32 to a corresponding diagram in an effective theory in which the w ",
    "boson is integrated out , which is then matched at @xmath18 to the self  energy graph in hqet . in the case of the semileptonic decay rate , ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , however , no such improvement is necessary due to the vanishing anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators , and the standard model diagrams are directly matched at @xmath18 to the hqet green function @xmath33 and to matrix elements of the hqet operators subleading in @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath34 denotes the heavy meson , @xmath35 is the heavy quark field in the effective theory and @xmath36 is the appropriate dirac structure . in this step one",
    "gets the running mass of the heavy quark raised to the fifth power evaluated at the scale @xmath23 .",
    "we stress that one is not forced to choose @xmath37 exactly ( see e.g.  neubert in @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath23 determines the separation of short and long  distance physics , the interaction from scales larger than @xmath23 is contained in the wilson coefficient , which contains the running quark mass . in an calculation to all orders the result does not change with the variation of @xmath23 . in practice one",
    "works with a truncated series and the dependence of the theoretical prediction on the scale @xmath38 estimates the reliability of the calculation .",
    "we will use this tool extensively in the phenomenolocical analysis of sec .",
    "the use of the pole mass in the wilson coefficient corresponds to the matching at an unnaturally low scale @xmath39 . in the case of the c quark",
    "this scale is too small for perturbative qcd to be trusted .",
    "we will now discuss the nature of the mass parameter , whose inverse powers appears in the square brackets in ( [ matchmu ] ) and stems from the hqet lagrangian .",
    "the starting point in the derivation of hqet is the decomposition of the heavy quark s momentum @xmath40 according to @xmath41 where @xmath4 is the heavy quark mass , @xmath42 is the four  velocity of the hadron and @xmath43 is the residual momentum .",
    "the latter is usually constrained by the condition @xmath44 & \\scriptstyle m_q \\to \\infty &   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that finally physical observables @xmath45 are expanded in a power series in @xmath46 : @xmath47    in eq .",
    "( [ old ] ) we have emphasized that in hqet the constraint @xmath48 is understood as a scaling relation : the residual momentum does not diverge when the limit @xmath16 is performed .",
    "obviously ( [ old ] ) can not hold for every definition of the mass , because a change in the qcd renormalization prescription for @xmath4 may redefine @xmath43 in ( [ hm ] ) by an amount involving @xmath49 , which scales like @xmath50 rather than staying constant .",
    "authors addressing the definition of the mass indeed only allow on  shell  like renormalization conditions for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "let us recall their key arguments : the qcd quark self ",

    "\\label{self } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the one  loop contribution to @xmath54 is expanded with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the @xmath57-th coefficient .",
    "now @xmath58 has to match the hqet self ",
    "energy @xmath59 up to @xmath60 . for this",
    "an on  shell  like renormalization condition @xmath61 with @xmath62 fixed as @xmath63 was required in @xcite .",
    "otherwise the term @xmath64 in ( [ self ] ) would diverge as @xmath16 and thereby could not be matched to any hqet green function , which scales at most as a constant due to ( [ old ] ) . in the following we set @xmath65 , so that @xmath4 in ( [ hm ] ) equals the pole mass , when the constraint ( [ old ] ) is imposed on @xmath43 .    from a phenomenologist s point of view",
    "the appearance of a quark pole mass is unsatisfactory , because quarks do not exist as free particles , so that the pole mass is no observable .",
    "any qcd calculation relates observables to running current masses , which are contained in wilson coefficients .",
    "the pole mass has to be _ calculated _ in terms of the current mass extracted from some experiment .",
    "( [ hm ] ) implies that the pole mass is calculated to all orders in perturbation theory : by truncating the perturbative series defining @xmath66 at order @xmath67 one picks up an error of the order @xmath68 in the residual momentum , so that it would not stay constant in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , the authors of @xcite have proven that the pole mass suffers from an extra infrared renormalon situated at @xmath69 in the borel plane , so that the result depends on the summation prescription chosen for the divergent perturbative series and is ill  defined by a term of order @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore want to avoid the use of the pole mass in the first step of the construction of hqet and use an arbitrary current mass instead . the final result , however , will be the same as with the pole mass as the starting point , but an alternative derivation might be illustrative .    if @xmath4 denotes the current mass in an arbitrary renormalization scheme of qcd , ( [ old ] ) can no more be imposed on @xmath43 and we have instead @xmath70 & \\scriptstyle m_q \\to \\infty & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because a change of the renormalization prescription for @xmath4 redefines @xmath43 by a quantity involving @xmath71 .",
    "nevertheless the heavy quark expansion of qcd green functions remains reasonable , because one still has @xmath72 for , so that @xmath73 is a small parameter .",
    "the heavy quark field @xmath74 is now unambiguously defined , because it involves the current mass .",
    "we can now investigate how the matching of qcd and hqet has to be performed in our approach : consider the ( non  truncated ) two  point function @xmath75 in qcd .",
    "level part reads @xmath76              + { \\cal o } \\left ( \\frac{1}{m_q \\ln m_q }   \\right ) .",

    "( [ ld ] ) and ( [ sld ] ) illustrate that with ( [ new ] ) the @xmath13expansion now yields a series in which each term is still suppressed compared to the preceding one , but only by a factor of order @xmath83 rather than of order @xmath46 .    the new feature in the matching of ( [ ld ] ) and ( [ sld ] ) to the corresponding expressions in hqet is the appearance of the term @xmath84 in ( [ sld ] ) which equals zero in the on  shell scheme . to accomodate for it",
    "we need an additional term @xmath85 in the hqet lagrangian with @xmath86 the hqet two  point green function with one insertion of @xmath87 then matches the first term in ( [ sld ] ) . when working to @xmath67-th order in @xmath88 , ( [ et ] )",

    "@xmath93 @xmath94 is a purely short  distance quantity and does not require any definition of @xmath66 beyond perturbation theory .",
    "consequently we treat the `` residual mass term '' @xmath95 as an interaction vertex and not as a part of the kinetic lagrangian .",
    "the other term involving @xmath84 in ( [ sld ] ) stems from the @xmath13part of the propagators between which @xmath96 is sandwiched .",
    "they clearly match the hqet two  point function with one insertion of @xmath95 and one insertion of the sum of the usual @xmath13subleading operators @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is evident how the matching of @xmath99 to @xmath100 works to higher orders in @xmath73 .",
    "the matching of the wave function counterterms is not different from the conventional approach with @xmath101 .",
    "the difference between the residual mass term introduced in @xcite and @xmath91 in ( [ et ] ) is that the former was constrained to be of order @xmath12 while @xmath94 is of order @xmath102 .",
    "the appearance of a positive power of @xmath4 in the hqet lagrangian has a dramatic consequence for the @xmath13-expansion of green functions : with the use of the pole mass inverse powers of @xmath4 and logarithms of @xmath103 are neatly separated , so that the @xmath13expansion coincides term  by  term with an operator product expansion in @xmath46 as in ( [ hqe ] ) . by using a current mass as the expansion parameter and introducing @xmath104 in the hqet lagrangian we have reshuffled the two expansions in @xmath13 and @xmath105 . in order to arrive directly at an operator product expansion ( [ hqe ] )",
    "one necessarily has to separate the heavy quark mass and self  interaction from the interaction with the light degrees of freedom , which is of order @xmath12 .",
    "the authors of @xcite have shown that this separation is ambiguous beyond perturbation theory and can introduce a residual mass term in the hqet lagrangian which is of order @xmath12 and is a remnant of the long  distance self ",
    "interaction of the heavy quark . as for the short  distance contributions to the self  energy of the heavy quark ,",
    "this separation is , however , possible and mandatory to achieve the abovementioned separation of powers and logarithms of @xmath4 directly .    by using an arbitrary current mass as the expansion parameter",
    "we have put the quark self  energy in the chosen qcd scheme entirely into the hqet lagrangian .",
    "nevertheless one can easily recover the correct operator product expansion : to this end we investigate how the hadronic parameters of hqet transform under a change of the renormalization scheme used to define @xmath4 .",
    "consider two schemes differing by a finite renormalization of the mass : @xmath106 the choice @xmath107 transforms to the pole mass .",
    "the transformation ( [ schtrafo ] ) modifies the hqet quark field as @xmath108 the parameter @xmath109 measures the mass difference between meson and quark .",
    "one easily finds : @xmath110 so that the meson mass @xmath111 is scheme  independent . in an arbitrary scheme @xmath109 contains the quark self  energy , whose short  distance part depends on @xmath4 , so that we have to add a flavor label to @xmath112 and write in the e.g.   @xmath15 scheme for @xmath79 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the usual @xmath109parameter which corresponds to the choice of @xmath115 and obeys the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "so far we have just trivially pushed self  energy contributions from the mass into @xmath116 .",
    "reference to the pole mass is for the first time made in ( [ laq ] ) , which expresses that only with an on  shell renormalization for @xmath4 the quantity @xmath109 is of order @xmath12 .",
    "from @xcite we know that the separation of @xmath66 and @xmath114 is ambiguous by long  distance terms of order @xmath12 . with our formalism",
    "we clearly do not resolve this ambiguity , but just make clear that it does not affect a practical phenomenological analysis , where one would like to use ( [ mesmas ] ) to extract , say , @xmath114 from an analysis of the d  meson system and to insert it into a prediction for the b  meson system .",
    "in the first step one extracts the current charm quark mass from some observable which is calculated with radiative corrections to some order @xmath117 .",
    "clearly in ( [ laq ] ) one will only subtract the quark self  energy to the same order , so that the prediction for the calculated observable will then have an error of the order @xmath118 .",
    "one is never faced with the problem to define the pole mass beyond perturbation theory .",
    "even if we did the calculation to a very high order , so that we saw the renormalon  induced divergence of the perturbative series for the self  energy in eq .",
    "( [ laq ] ) , we would naively expect that the renormalon ambiguity cancels in the prediction , if we fixed the summation prescription for the perturbation series in both the d- and b- analysis in the same way .",
    "we will next discuss the scheme  dependence of the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which appear at order @xmath13 and parametrize the matrix elements with two heavy meson states of equal velocity . at this order",
    "the residual mass @xmath91 has to be taken into account .",
    "we first want to define @xmath119 and @xmath120 in a scheme  invariant way , i.e.  such that they are independent of @xmath91 . from @xcite",
    "we know that the latter can be obtained by replacing the covariant derivative @xmath121 by @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , for a heavy meson @xmath34 with mass @xmath123 we find @xmath124 to be invariant with respect to the transformations ( [ schtrafo ] ) and ( [ schtrafo2 ] ) .",
    "consider now some observable whose @xmath13part looks for @xmath115 like @xmath125 with some constants @xmath126 and @xmath127 plus a similar term with @xmath120 . in an arbitrary scheme one gets the current mass instead in the denominator of ( [ 1 m ] ) , but the second order in the @xmath13expansion involves matrix elements with one insertion of @xmath91 and two insertions of the @xmath13operators .",
    "since @xmath128 , these contributions are of the same order as the first order radiative corrections in ( [ 1 m ] ) .",
    "renormalization scheme  invariance of qcd requires that both terms combine to a scheme ",
    "invariant quantity : @xmath129 if we want to include explicit radiative corrections to order @xmath67 in ( [ 1 m ] ) , we must calculate @xmath91 to order @xmath130 and have to take into account matrix elements with multiple insertions of @xmath91 up to order @xmath131 , so that the reordering of the expansions in @xmath13 and @xmath14 takes place over @xmath67 orders in the @xmath13expansion .",
    "hence the final result is the same as with the use of the pole mass from the very beginning . yet in our derivation the pole mass appears explicitly only in the last step of the derivation .",
    "one has to calculate it only to the same ( finite ) order in perturbation theory as the explicit radiative corrections to the corresponding term in the observable ( [ 1 m ] ) under consideration .    in the sketch given above the",
    "ambiguously defined pole mass to all orders does not appear in the definition of the hqet field @xmath132 , instead the self  energy @xmath133 of the quark is encoded order by order in @xmath14 in the hqet lagrangian .",
    "we have made plausible that the use of hqet in a phenomenological analysis , which includes radiative corrections to some _ finite _ order to the various terms in the @xmath13expansion , does not require the calculation of @xmath66 beyond the same order in its perturbative series .",
    "let us emphasize again that our formalism of hqet with the current mass as the starting point leads exactly to the same result as the conventional one , if one uses the pole mass calculated perturbatively to the same order as the explicit radiative corrections multiplying the @xmath13term under consideration .",

    "the rather marginal scale  dependence of @xmath8 visible in fig .",

    "[ tab : scalinv ] we give for different scales @xmath222 the values of the quark masses , their ratio that enters the phase ",
    "space factor , the value of the latter one , the branching ratio divided by phase  space and the branching ratio itself , calculated with @xmath225 .",
    "although the quark masses differ rather drastically , the ratio @xmath226 is not very sensitive to @xmath144 and also the phase ",
    "space factor @xmath155 varies by only about 10% in the range @xmath227 .",
    "the branching ratio divided by phase ",
    "space as well as the branching ratio itself are even less sensitive to the scale . we thus find that the change in @xmath228 is nearly completely compensated by a corresponding change in the terms in @xmath229 which is far from being trivial . from the figures we read off @xmath230 where the first error includes the dependence on @xmath119 in the interval @xmath148\\,\\text{gev}^2 $ ] , the second one the scale  uncertainty , and the third one all other uncertainties in the parameters , i.e.  in the branching ratios , @xmath231 , and @xmath209 . in principle , there is also an uncertainty due to the scheme  dependence of our analysis which is however difficult to estimate .",
    "if the on  shell scheme was trustworthy , we could take the difference of our results and those of @xcite as rough estimate for that `` hidden '' theoretical error . for lack of any other calculation in a reasonable scheme",
    "we are however forced to leave that point open to future investigations .",
    "the above value of @xmath8 has to be compared with @xmath232 the value quoted in @xcite is the most recent one obtained from the spectrum of the _ exclusive _ decay @xmath233 fitted to the isgur  wise function using different shapes .",
    "we observe that our result nearly coincides with the one from exclusive decays , but is smaller than the ones obtained in @xcite where the on  shell scheme was used .",
    "let us close this section with a short comment on the prospects of a future reduction of the errors in ( [ eq : resvcb ] ) . to begin with , experimentalists are challenged to carry out more accurate measurements of the branching ratios , especially of @xmath135 .",
    "combining with more sophisticated determinations of @xmath231 @xcite and @xmath209 will reduce the third error . as for the second error due to scale ",
    "dependence there is no simple remedy at hand and we hardly can imagine any reliable method to be invented in the near future to fix the scale except for a calculation of the @xmath219 corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) which is a truly formidable task .",
    "so the main efforts should be concentrated on the determination of @xmath119 .",
    "although in @xcite there was proposed a method of relating @xmath119 to moments of the so  called `` shape  function '' determining the end",
    " point region of the lepton and photon  spectrum in the decays @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively , at present that approach suffers from missing both measurements and any formulas going beyond @xmath236 .",
    "yet the introduction of the shape ",
    "function leads to the constraint @xmath237 which is in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite and @xcite , but in contrast to the earlier determination @xcite , where a positive value was obtained .",
    "the status of the careful analysis done in @xcite with qcd sum rules is unfortunately not beyond any doubt , cf.@xcite , so a clarification of that point would be welcome .",
    "if the result of @xcite could be confirmed , ( [ eq : resvcb ] ) would read @xmath238 .",
    "in applications of the heavy quark expansion of qcd to physical quantities involving positive powers of the heavy quark mass the proper definition of the mass parameter is of supreme phenomenological importance .",
    "we have made clear that the heavy quark mass parameter stemming from the wilson coefficient in the matching of perturbative qcd and hqet green functions , in a rigorous qcd context enters the calculation as the running current mass rather than the pole mass .",
    "it is evaluated at the scale at which we perform the matching .",
    "this scale must be of order of the heavy quark mass , but can be varied to estimate the error caused by the truncation of the perturbative series .",
    "the choice of the on  shell scheme , which is widely used also for the mass parameters in the wilson coefficient , corresponds to a special choice for @xmath23 , which is unnaturally low in the case of the @xmath0 quark .",
    "it is well  known that the heavy quark expansion reproduces in leading order the parton model . with the proper identification of the mass parameter stemming from the wilson coefficient",
    "we also recover the familiar renormalization scheme and scale  dependence of the parton model .",
    "the natural expansion parameter of the hqet green functions , however , is the pole mass , which was recently found to be ambiguous when defined beyond finite orders in perturbation theory . since hqet attempts to include non  perturbative effects",
    ", a phenomenologist using hqet has to worry whether this ambiguity may be relevant for his physical predictions .",
    "we have argued that a calculation which includes only radiative corrections to a finite order to a given term in the @xmath13expansion , requires only the calculation of the perturbative pole mass to the same order in @xmath14 .",
    "this fact is plausible , but not completely obvious , because the usual derivation of hqet requires the all  orders pole mass in the first step to define the heavy quark field @xmath132 .",
    "the proper identification of the mass parameters becomes probably most pronounced in the case of semileptonic inclusive decays .",
    "their decay rate depends on the quark mass in its fifth power and is most sensitive to any change in the definition of that parameter . here",
    "it likewise becomes rather obvious that the on  shell scheme is , even apart from the renormalon problem , a rather unnatural one , since it is always the _ current mass _ that appears in actual calculations , whereas the pole mass has to be put in afterwards by hand , adding higher order terms in @xmath14 in an uncontrollable manner .",
    "we have carefully studied the effect of changing the scheme and scale and found that neither the @xmath0 nor the @xmath127 quark mass can be determined reliably from inclusive decays . in extracting @xmath8",
    ", however , the scale  dependence mostly cancels and we found a reduction of the value of @xmath8 by more than 10% compared with results obtained in the on  shell scheme @xcite . by a more consistent error analysis , in particular of the scale  dependence",
    ", we also could reduce the absolute error of @xmath8 .",
    "we also clarified the meaning of the renormalization scale @xmath23 entering the parton model and its non  perturbative corrections and identified it with the scale at which hqet is matched to qcd , a point that was not paid proper attention to in the previous analyses @xcite .",
    "finally , we suppose that our considerations could also give some hint at the solution of the problem of the `` baffling semileptonic branching ratio of @xmath239 mesons '' raised in @xcite and that it could be worthwile to attack that problem starting from a different choice of the renormalization scheme .",
