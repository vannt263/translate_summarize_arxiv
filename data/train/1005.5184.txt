    "although we have yet to obtain a microscopic solution of the kondo lattice problem that serves as a model for heavy electron materials , thanks to a recent phenomenological analysis @xcite of decades of experimental efforts on heavy electron behavior , we now have an experiment - based model for their behavior that explains existing experiments and has predictive power in the exploration of new families of heavy electron materials .",
    "our model provides a unified explanation of the emergence of the heavy electron kondo liquid that is responsible for the anomalies seen in the knight shift , magneto - transport , and other experiments , leads to a new phase diagram that replaces the doniach picture , and has the potential for becoming the standard model of heavy electron physics .",
    "it contains several basic aspects :    * there exists a unique temperature scale @xmath0 for each heavy electron material ; it marks the emergence of a new state of matter , a coherent heavy electron ( kondo ) liquid that is produced by the collective hybridization of the local moments with the conduction electron sea , and exhibits universal behavior that scales with @xmath0@xcite .",
    "* @xmath0 is the nearest neighbor rkky ( ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ) local moment interaction ; for the local moments it separates their high-@xmath4 weakly interacting phase from their low-@xmath4 entangled phase .",
    "it is given by @xmath5@xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the single - ion kondo coupling to the background conduction electron density of states @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "* the entangled phase below @xmath0 is described by a two - fluid model @xcite in which an order parameter , @xmath7 , characterizes the reduction of the overall system entropy brought about by the transfer of spectral weight from the f - electron local moments to the itinerant heavy electron kondo liquid formed out of the conduction electron sea . * the quasiparticles of the kondo liquid exhibit coherent non - landau fermi liquid behavior ; their spin susceptibility and specific heat vary as @xmath8 down to a crossover temperature @xmath9 .",
    "* their behavior below @xmath9 can lead to unconventional superconductivity produced by quantum critical fluctuations @xcite , or an antiferromagntic ordering of the local moments in which kondo liquid relocalization occurs as a precursor @xcite .",
    "the position of a number of heavy electron materials on our proposed new phase diagram is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we see that @xmath100.15 roughly separates the antiferromagnets and superconductors . in striking contrast to the conventional doniach diagram which postulates a competition between collective behavior produced by rkky interaction and single - ion behavior characterized by the single - ion kondo temperature , @xmath11",
    ", the latter quantity is found to be much smaller than @xmath0 for almost all the materials considered there . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the variation of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and the ordering temperatures , @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a function of pressure for the heavy electron material cerhin@xmath14 .",
    "there one can see how the competition between localization ( antiferromagnetic order ) and itinerancy ( superconductivity ) for kondo liquid quasiparticles plays out as @xmath15 increases .",

    "@xmath0 is from resistivity peak and hall anomaly .",

    "@xmath9 is from hall anomaly @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is estimated from ce@xmath16la@xmath17rhin@xmath14 . ]",
    "the kondo coupling @xmath2 between a localized f - moment and conduction electron spins gives rise to two competing characteristic temperature scales in a kondo lattice : @xmath18 where @xmath3 , the density of states of conduction electrons , can be determined by the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath19 of the corresponding nonmagnetic compound ( e.g. , lacoin@xmath14 for cecoin@xmath14 ) , @xmath20 .",
    "after a correction to account for change of chemical pressure upon doping , the value of @xmath2 for the kondo lattice material can be determined by measurements of @xmath11 in the diluted compound ( e.g. , ce@xmath16la@xmath17coin@xmath14 ) , where it is given by @xmath21 .",
    "an analysis @xcite of dozens of heavy electron materials and the pressure data of cerhin@xmath14 showed that in all cases of interest , @xmath11 was quite small compared to @xmath0 , so that it was natural to inquire whether @xmath0 might be given by the rkky interaction , eq .",
    "( [ rkky ] ) , with a near - universal value of @xmath22 . as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , this is indeed the case , with a best fit analysis yielding @xmath230.45 , so that @xmath24",
    "although @xmath0 marks the onset of coherent collective hybridization , the process is not instantaneous ; the heavy electron kondo liquid emerges over a broad temperature range from @xmath0 to a much lower cut - off temperature , @xmath9 , and throughout this temperature region , one therefore expects two components : the emergent kondo non - landau fermi liquid composed of conduction electrons made heavy by their collective hybridization with the local moments and a local moment spin liquid formed by the substantial fraction of local moments that have not hybridized .",
    "one is thus led to postulate a two - fluid model @xcite with an order parameter @xmath7 that denotes the fraction of the f - moments that participate in the collective hybridization ; both @xmath7 and the scaling properties of the kondo liquid can be determined directly from experiments displaying the various heavy electron anomalies .",
    "consider , for example , knight shift measurements @xcite .",
    "since the f - moments are fully localized above @xmath0 , the knight shift of a given probe nucleus measures directly their susceptibility . below @xmath0 , it probes both the local moment and kondo liquid contributions to the total magnetic susceptibility , @xmath25 , but since it couples differently to each , it will no longer be proportional to the total susceptibility , hence the appearance of the anomaly seen beginning at @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the two - fluid model expressions are thus : @xmath26\\chi_l,\\\\ k&=&k_0+af(t)\\chi_h + b[1-f(t)]\\chi_l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the intrinsic susceptibility of the heavy electrons and the unhybridized local moments , respectively . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are their hyperfine couplings .",
    "since the knight shift anomaly below @xmath0 is given by , @xmath31 we see that it acts as a direct probe of the emergent kondo liquid susceptibility .",
    "a careful analysis of the knight shift and other experiments on cecoin@xmath14 shows that @xmath32 while if one requires that the intrinsic entropy of the kondo liquid approaches the free moment entropy @xmath332 at @xmath0 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the wilson ratio .",
    "knight shift measurements on other heavy electron materials and fits to the anomalous behavior seen in magneto - transport , point contact spectroscopy , and raman spectroscopy show that these expressions are universal @xcite .",
    "a comparison to recent state - of - the - art numerical dmft calculations @xcite shows good agreement with the kondo liquid quasi - particle density of states determined from eq .",
    "( [ chih ] ) , and demonstrates that that these contain the feedback needed to achieve collective hybridization .",
    "the low temperature cut - off at @xmath9 in the measured scaling behavior of the kondo liquid marks the onset of new physical processes that take precedence over its growth due to collective hybridization .",
    "the two - fluid model continues to apply in this region , and provides important information about both the unconventional superconducting states and the onset of antiferromagnetism observed in heavy electron materials .",
    "knight shift measurements are especially informative , as these provide direct information on changes in the kondo liquid as the material becomes superconducting or antiferromagnetic .",
    "an analysis of cecoin@xmath14 confirms the universal behavior of the kondo liquid @xcite : it follows two - fluid prediction above @xmath9 ( @xmath36 ) and , upon becoming superconducting , follows the bcs d - wave prediction below @xmath13 , independent of the probe nuclei .",
    "important information on the pairing mechanism for the measured d - wave superconductivity can be obtained from the nqr spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath37 . by using the two - fluid formula @xmath38 where the local moment @xmath39 is given by the high temperature fit .",
    "a simple two - fluid analysis reveals quantum critical fluctuations in the kondo liquid , and yields @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance from the quantum critical point .",
    "a similar two - fluid analysis applied to heavy electron antiferromagnets cerhin@xmath14 and cept@xmath42in@xmath43 has recently led to the discovery that at a temperature @xmath9 well above the nel temperature , the kondo liquid begins to relocalize , with a corresponding decrease in @xmath44 , confirming the important role played by the kondo liquid in bringing about the antiferromagnetic order of both it and the residual local moments present at @xmath12 .",
    "by analogy to the idea of a standard model based on a well - defined microscopic theory , we have proposed here an experiment - based standard phenomenological model for heavy electron materials that derives from the successful systematic examination of existing experiments on a broad spectrum of heavy electron materials .",
    "its predictions for heavy electron emergence at @xmath0 accompanied by anomalous scaling behavior can easily be checked for any newly - discovered heavy electron family , and have recently been confirmed by experiments on the newly - discovered 127 family .    of particular interest are the correlations in our model between measured values of @xmath15 and the appearance of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity at low temperatures .",
    "as we have noted , materials with @xmath45 all appear to be antiferromagnets , but can easily be made into superconductors by applying pressure to increase @xmath15 , as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] demonstrates vividly for the rh-115 family .",
    "moreover , since the superconducting transition temperature seems to scale with @xmath0 , a strategy for finding a higher @xmath13 family of heavy electron materials might begin by searching for materials with large values of @xmath0 , a strategy that proved successful in the discovery of the puga members of the 115 family .",
    "we note this can be achieved either by finding materials with values of @xmath15 that significantly exceed 0.15 , or , with @xmath46 , finding materials that possess a comparatively low value of @xmath3 , or equivalently a large conduction electron bandwidth , and a correspondingly high value of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , to the extent that @xmath13 scales with @xmath0 , for a fixed value of @xmath15 , one would have @xmath13 scaling with @xmath2 or the conduction electron bandwidth @xmath47 .",
