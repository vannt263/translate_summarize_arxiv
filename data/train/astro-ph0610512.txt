    "most of the gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) observed in the pre - swift era showed a smooth power law decay with time in the x - ray and optical afterglow light - curve @xcite .",
    "this behavior was found to be consistent with the basic predictions of the fireball model , where the afterglow flux is produced as a relativistic blast wave propagating into an external medium . under the assumption of a spherical fireball and a uniform medium , sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 )",
    "@xcite showed that the dependence of the flux on frequency and time can be represented by several power law segments , @xmath0 , each of which applies to a different regime . before swift only a few grbs showing deviations from the smooth power law light curve were known , see e.g. the case of grb 021004 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this simple picture is now changing since the advent of swift .",
    "erratic x - ray flares have been detected by swift in almost half of its grbs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while some bursts show one distinct flare after the grb prompt emission , ( e.g. grb 050406 @xcite ) , other events like grb 050502b and grb 050713a , show several flares @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of current grb science is to understand the origin of this newly observed light curve behavior .",
    "since flares are likely to trace the activity of the central engine , they can help us gain insights on the physical processes governing the early post - grb phases .",
    "note that flares have been observed in the light curves of both long and short grbs . as a first step toward the understanding of different flares characteristics it is fundamental to carry out a systematic investigation of the morphological and timing properties of the flares observed by swift / xrt ( chincarini et al .",
    "2006@xcite ) .    in some cases we can already rule out some models that have been proposed to explain the flare phenomenon .",
    "the presence of several flares in one grb strongly disfavors scenarios that can only account for one flare , e.g. the self synchrotron compton emission from reverse shock @xcite .",
    "density bumps @xcite can not be responsible of large amplitude rebrightenings ( e.g. grb 050502b @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we carry out a detailed spectral and timing analysis of flares in several grbs with the goal of constraining the physical mechanism responsible for its production .",
    "in particular we concentrate on two models proposed for the flares , the late internal shock ( is ) model and the refreshed shocks ( rs ) model .    in the internal shock scenario",
    "the flares are due to the reactivation of the grb central engine and they are produced from an `` internal '' dissipation radius within the external blast wave front @xcite . in this case a mechanism to reactivate the engine is required .",
    "for the long bursts , king et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xcite proposed a model in which the flares could be produced from the fragmentation of the collapsing stellar core in a modified hypernova scenario .",
    "for the case of short grbs , macfadyen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xcite suggested that the flares could be the result of the interaction between the grb outflow and a non - stellar companion .",
    "more recently , perna et al .",
    "( 2006 ) @xcite have analyzed the observational properties of flares in both long and short bursts , and suggested a common scenario in which flares are powered by the late - time accretion of fragments of material produced in the gravitationally unstable outer parts of an hyper - accreting accretion disk .",
    "other mechanisms that could produce flares involve a magnetic origin @xcite , @xcite .    in the refreshed shock scenario @xcite",
    "the flares are due to late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow moving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase . in this case",
    "we do not need a reactivation of the engine .",
    "this model can interpret several flares features @xcite , @xcite seen in some grbs .",
    "both models have observational consequences that can be tested . in this paper",
    "we propose and exploit some diagnostics between the two models .",
    "we consider all the grbs detected by swift between the swift launch and 2006 january 31 .",
    "we select all those that showed prominent flares in their x - ray lightcurves . in table 1",
    "we list all the grbs that were selected for the analysis .",
    "a more extensive analysis that will be presented includes a larger sample of swift grbs @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data were reduced using the swift software ( v. 2.0 ) and in particular the xrt software developed at the asdc and heasarc @xcite .",
    "important information on the mechanism producing the flares can be obtained from the comparison between the observed variability timescale @xmath1 and the time @xmath2 , at which the flare is observed . in the refreshed shock scenario",
    "the early afterglow has a variability timescale of the order of the time since the explosion , @xmath3 @xcite , while in the late internal shock model @xmath4 .",
    "we calculated for all the flares of the sample the ratio between the duration of the flare , @xmath1 , and the time at which the flare peaks @xmath5 and report these values in table 1 .",
    "we also report the time at which the rising behavior of the light curve begins @xmath6 . in our analysis",
    "@xmath1 is defined as the difference between the times at which the light curve shows the end of the falling and the beginning of the rising behaviors .",
    "all times refer to the bat trigger .",
    "as we can see from this table , within the uncertainties , all flares have @xmath7 , in agreement with the refreshed shock scenario .",
    "however some of these flares have other characteristics that can be better explained in the internal shock scenario .",
    "the strategy for our temporal fitting procedure is the following .",
    "we consider the data in the range between @xmath6 and @xmath5 to compute the slope,@xmath8 , of the rising part of the light curve .",
    "the start time is set to @xmath6 . for the decay , we use the data in the range between @xmath5 and the end of the decaying behavior to estimate the power law decay index @xmath9 .",
    "the start time has been set to @xmath5 .",
    "we note that the power - law rise and decay indices depend strongly on the initial counting time , @xmath10 . in the internal shock scenario ,",
    "the re - starting of the central engine re - sets the starting time .",
    "this is why some authors @xcite use @xmath11 to estimate @xmath9 and thus find much steeper temporal slopes ( we call these slopes @xmath12 ) .",
    "we think that the right choice for the start time is @xmath5 .",
    "this is because a start time earlier than the beginning of the decaying behavior causes an unphysical steepening of the slope , due only to mathematical effects . in any case , since the @xmath10 issue is an open problem , we also discuss what happens to the decay slope if the start time is set to @xmath6 .",
    "we therefore report both @xmath13 and @xmath12 for the bursts were the internal shocks better interpret the flare phenomenology .",
    "the analysis of the window timing ( wt ) light curves of the flares reveal complex spectral variations . to investigate the nature of these variations we performed a time resolved spectral analysis .",
    "we first fitted the spectra in the rise and decay parts with a simple power law combined with photoelectric absorption .",
    "we indicate with @xmath14 the photon index .",
    "the results of our fits are shown in table 2 .",
    "large spectral variations are evident , in particular between the spectra corresponding to the rise and fall of several flares .    motivated by the synchrotron emission model @xcite",
    ", we then fitted the spectra using a broken power law model .",
    "we kept the low energy ( before the cooling frequency ) spectral power law index fixed at @xmath15 , as expected from standard synchrotron models and left the high energy power law index @xmath16 as a free parameter .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 . in some cases we were not able to fit the spectrum with a broken power law , as evident in table 3 ( we write `` na '' in this case ) .",
    ".*values of z , @xmath1 , @xmath2 for each flare * [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is by now apparent that flares in the light curves of grbs decay have different characteristics .",
    "while it may prove difficult to explain their complex phenomenology within the framework of a single model , we can nevertheless constrain some of the models by carefully exploiting the present data .",
    "we have presented a timing and spectral analysis of several flares detected by swift . since the main energy output of the grb engine rapidly decays with time @xcite , the energy injections are likely due either to slower shells ejected during the prompt phase of the grb engine and catching up at later times ( refreshed shocks ) , or to later energy production episodes in the central engine , due , e.g.,to disk fragments that accrete at later times @xcite ( late internal shocks ) .",
    "we have proposed a method to distinguish between these two different models based on the estimate of the flare duration and on the comparison between the spectral and temporal slopes .",
    "we found that the flares of grb050713a , grb050730 and grb050904 can be explained by the refreshed shock model .",
    "we saw that the flares in grb050730 do not satisfy the relation implied by the curvature effect between the temporal and spectral slope , indicating that internal shocks may be less likely in this case .",
    "however there are other bursts ( like grb 050406 , grb 050502b and grb050822 ) were late internal shocks may interpret better the flares characteristics .",
    "we plan to extend our analysis to a larger sample of swift grbs .    flaring activity",
    "is also observed in the optical afterglow of some grbs ( like grb 050730 see perri et al .",
    "detection of optical rebrightenings in the light curve would also help in testing the models .",
    "simultaneous re - brightening events in the x  ray and optical bands , like the ones seen in grb 050730 can be easily explained in the refreshed shock model ( e.g. @xcite ) ."
