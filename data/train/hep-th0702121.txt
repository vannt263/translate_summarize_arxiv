    "<S> , we show that an inflation with a sufficient expansion make the current holographic dark energy density exponentially small . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible that an inflation of @xmath0 could solve the cosmic coincidence problem without introducing an interaction with dark matter or modifying gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy models have an intrinsic advantage over non - holographic models in that it does not need fine tuning of parameters or an @xmath117 mechanism to cancel the zero - point energy of the vacuum , simply because it has no @xmath118 zero - point vacuum energy from the start . </S>",
    "<S> quantum field theory over - counts the independent physical degrees of freedom inside the volume . </S>",
