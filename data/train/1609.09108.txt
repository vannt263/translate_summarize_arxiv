    "variability , which is found from radio to tev @xmath0-ray bands , is one of the major characteristics of blazars .",
    "the variability timescales from a few minutes to days in the optical band have been extensively investigated ( e.g. sillanp@xmath1 et al .",
    "1991 ; wagner @xmath2 witzel 1996 ; lainela et al .",
    "1999 ) . particularly in the x - ray and tev regimes in which photons are produced by radiation of ultra - relativistic electrons close to their maximum energy ,",
    "the observations of variability timescales constrain on particle acceleration mechanism in tev blazars . for examples , kataoka et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported the observations of the x - ray flares with timescales of from hours to days for three tev blazars ( markarian 421 , markarian 501 , and pks 2155 - 304 ) , albert et al .",
    "( 2007 ) obtained a rapid tev variability with of several ten minutes for markarian 501 by magic . observed short timescales",
    "indicate that the variability is associated with small regions in the relativistic jet , which is located on a distance in excess of one hundred schwarzschild radii ( @xmath3 ) with a central black hole mass @xmath4 , rather than the center region ( begelman et al .",
    "relativistic particles maybe responsible for the emission flare .",
    "these particles are ejected from the central region alone with the subsistent jet structure , and radiate away their energy at @xmath5 quickly , or the particles are accelerated within the jet , close to the emission region .",
    "generally , soft lags can be interpreted as due to electron cooling ( kirk et al .",
    "1998 ; kirk @xmath2 mastichiadis 1999 ; kusunose et al .",
    "however , with the fast tev @xmath0-ray flare in markain 501 on july 9 , 2005 , the evidence that hard @xmath0-ray lagged the soft ones by @xmath6 minutes was discovered ( albert et al .",
    "2007 ) . for explaining these abnormal phenomenon , bednarek @xmath2 wagner ( 2008 ) proposed the radiating blob accelerating during the flare , but in their model the particles would only undergo cooling processes without any accelerating around the high blob lorentz factor plasma flow .",
    "mastichiadis @xmath2 moraitis ( 2008 ) showed that allowing the particles to accelerate gradually can explain the observed feature , and reach the particles energy to @xmath7 , the acceleration timescales is of the order of hours .",
    "following their model , tammi @xmath2 duffy ( 2009 ) compared four different acceleration mechanisms , and pointed out that the timescale may be too long for first - order fermi acceleration , so the stochastic acceleration may be as a promising candidate for the energy dependent time delays .",
    "motivated by above arguments , we study the time - dependent one - zone synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model in the presence of stochastic particle acceleration , and then apply the model to markarian 501 for explaining its flare and time delay properties , especially the rapid flare of markarian 501 on july 9 , 2005 . throughout the paper",

    "[ fig:4 ] , where the fluxes are normalized to the pre - burst state .",
    "it can be seen that ( 1 ) the quasi - symmetric light curve during the flare is reproduced quite well ; ( 2 ) the peaking time of the flare at higher energies lags relative to that at lower energies ; and ( 3 ) the amplitude of the flare becomes smaller as the photon energy increase .    in order to comparing the simulated light curves with the observations , we show the comparisons of predicted light curves with the observations by magic ( albert et al .",

    "finally , we calculate the time lag between 0.15 - 0.25 tev and 1.2 - 10 tev using the gaussian fit of the simulated light curves , and find out that the light curve at higher energies ( 1.2 - 10 tev ) lags relative to that at lower energies ( 0.15 - 0.25 tev ) by a factor of about @xmath145 , this timescale correspond to about 4.7 minutes in the observer s frame .",

    "[ fig:6 ] that the evolution of the flare points shows a clear canonical anti - clockwise - loop .",
    "in this paper , we have tried to explain the tev @xmath0-ray flare of markarian 501 observed by magic telescope on july 9 , 2005 in the context of the time - dependent one - zone ssc model which includes stochastic particle acceleration . in this model , particles with low energy",
    "are assumed to be injected and then are accelerated to higher energy by second - order fermi acceleration mechanism ( fermi 1949 ) , the most important photon targets for inverse compton scattering by relativistic electrons are the synchrotron photons .",
    "we have studied time - dependent properties of flares by reproducing the pre - burst spectrum of the source and varying the injection rate . in our results ,",
    "the behaviour of the mean multi - frequencies spectra before and during the flare is a little different , the peaks of both synchrotron and ic emissions move to lower frequencies , we argue that this can be explained by the energy loss of the electrons during the outburst . in this scenario ,",
    "the hard lag flare can be obtained and during the flare , it shows a clear canonical anti - clockwise - loop .",
    "it should be noted that hard lags require some sort of particle acceleration .",
    "if the variability timescale is faster than the cooling timescale , the radiation from accelerated particles would show a hard lag ( albert et al .",
    "kirk et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that the hard lag from the acceleration process induces to the anti - clockwise - loop pattern .",
    "in this view , albert et al .",
    "( 2007 ) concluded that the acceleration process of low energy particles probably dominate over the tev @xmath0-ray flare . assuming a low energy electrons injection and stochastic acceleration , our calculations predicted hard lags dependent flaring activity and showed a anti - clock - loop evolution of the hardness ratio with the flux .",
    "these are in agreement with the observational results on july 9 , 2005 , and imply that , during the flare , the dynamics of the system is dominated by the acceleration , rather than by the cooling processes .",
    "however , a detailed investigation of electron acceleration in the presence of losses has so far been performed only by a few investigators ( e.g. mastichiadis & moraits 2008 ) .",
    "given the complexity of the flaring activity of high energy radiation , this requires more detailed observations and the issue to be open .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence will is generated if standing shocks form in the neighborhood of the central object , which amplify any incoming upstream turbulence in the downstream accretion shock magnetosheath ( campeanu & schlickeiser 1992 ) .",
    "these magnetohydrodynamic plasma waves are the free energy and lead to stochastic acceleration of charged particles .",
    "actually , stochastic acceleration occurs wherever there are turbulent magnetic fields and can spread to an extended region , the size is determined by the turbulence generation and decay rates .",
    "virtanen & vainio ( 2005 ) simulated the stochastic acceleration in relativistic shocks and shows , when the particles were accelerated behind the discontinuity , a gradual shift of the whole particle spectrum to higher energy .",
    "some recent observations of particles spectra with hard power law spectral indices , @xmath148 with @xmath149 , suggests that the stochastic acceleration is seen in the observations ( katarzynski et al .",
    "2006 ; b@xmath150ttcher et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the model presented here contains the stochastic acceleration process . for simplicity",
    ", we introduced a constant acceleration term , which is associated with the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "the form of the diffusion coefficient due to interactions with magnetohydrodynamic waves has been discussed in details ( e.g. kulsrud & ferrari 1971 ; schlickeiser 2002 ) . in our model ,",
    "both constant acceleration and escape times are assumed , leading to @xmath151 .",
    "the form of the diffusion coefficient corresponds to the hard - sphere approximation , in which the mean free path for article - wave interaction is independent of particle energy , and probably induces to a complicated spectrum .",
    "furthermore , since the basic shock acceleration models postulate that @xmath152 ( e.g. , katarzynski et al .",
    "2006 ) , we adopt the shorter acceleration and escape timescales ( @xmath153 ) than other investigators ( generally , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 , see e.g. , kirk et al .",
    "1998 ; mastichiadis & moraitis 2008 ) .",
    "these assumptions can lead to higher acceleration rate and lower escape rate , and make more particles acceleration up to high energy rapidly .",
    "there are two scenarios for explaining the intrinsic variability .",
    "the first scenario assumes that the observed variations origin from the geometry of emitting sources ( e.g. , camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ; gopal - krishna & wiita 1992 ) .",
    "the second scenario assumes that the variability is generated by change of the emission condition .",
    "a typical example is that fresh particles are injected into acceleration region and then are accelerated ( e.g. , blandford & konigl 1979 ; marscher & gear 1985 ; celotti et al .",
    "1991 ; kirk et al .",
    "1998 ) . in order to reproduce both high energy radiation and variability of markarian 501",
    ", we change the injection rate of the low energy particles .",
    "it should be noted that when the shock front overruns a region in the jet in which the local plasma density is enhanced .",
    "the number of particles increase as an avalanche occurring in the jet , the injection rate can be expected to change .",

    "<S> we investigate rapid tev flaring in markarian 501 in the frame of a time - dependent one - zone synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> electrons are accelerated to extra - relativistic energy through the stochastic particle acceleration and evolve with the time , nonthermal photons are produced by both synchrotron and inverse comtpon scattering off synchrotron photons . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> nonthermal photons during a pre - flare are produced by the relativistic electrons in the steady state and those during a flare are produced by the electrons whose injection rate is changed at some time interval . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the model to the rapid flare of markarian 501 on july 9 , 2005 and obtain the multi - wavelength spectra during the pre - flare and during the flare . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the time - dependent properties of flares can be reproduced by varying the injection rate of electrons and a clear canonical anti - clockwise - loop can be given .    </S>",
