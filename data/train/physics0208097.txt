    "<S> the process of optical frequency doubling can lead , in the undepleted regime ,   to the generation of a x - wave envelope with group velocity locked to the pump beam . </S>",
    "<S> its parameters and its angular spectrum , are directly related to the zero- and first - order dispersive features of the nonlinear process . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes a   novel mechanism for spatio - temporal localization of light .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the _ linear _ maxwell equations admit localized solutions dates back to the book of stratton , @xcite as pointed out more recently . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , this research   topics has flourished   only after durnin et al . </S>",
    "<S> experiment in 1987 , who reported the practical realization of non - diffracting bessel @xmath0 beams . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since then , linear waves localized in both space and time ( i.e. , non - diffracting and non - dispersing ) have been reported in experiments , @xcite , while main theoretical advances encompass the generalization of propagation invariant solutions @xcite and the study of their finite - aperture realizations @xcite , or propagation in dispersive media @xcite and waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aspect of superluminality @xcite as well as potential applications such as femtosecond microscopy and communication systems have been also considered . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    recently , x - waves have been shown to be important also for nonlinear optics , since they exist as propagation invariant solutions to standard paraxial dispersive propagation models @xcite , whose formation is triggered by conical emission . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in second harmonic ( sh ) generation , these wavepackets are constituted by x - shaped envelopes at sh and fundamental frequency ( ff ) traveling locked together , which allow to explain recent experimental results @xcite . since these x - waves continue to exist in the linear limit ( in this sense they differ from any kind of soliton ) where the ff and sh are uncoupled </S>",
    "<S> , it is natural to study the mechanism of their formation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that a x - wave at sh can be generated spontaneously via doubling of a broad ff pump beam in the undepleted stage of its propagation .    to this end , let us start by reminding that the most simple axisymmetric localized wave in a dispersive medium with refractive index @xmath1 and wavenumber @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being vacuum light velocity ) can   be expressed as a superposition of bessel beams @xcite @xmath4 d\\omega \\text{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] are the transverse and longitudinal wavenumbers , respectively.@xcite equation([eq : xformula ] )   describes a non - diffracting and non - dispersive beam provided that the following _ x - wave dispersion relation _ is satisfied  @xmath7 indeed , eq.([eq : xdispersion ] ) entails vanishing dispersion @xmath8 at all orders @xmath9 , and in turn an intensity @xmath10 which depends only upon the retarded time @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the inverse wavepacket velocity . given the spectrum @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the two parameters that characterize the localized wave . in the case of vacuum , when @xmath16 the spatio - temporal spectrum has an x - shape ( @xmath17 ) and , due to invariant propagation , the far - field coincides with the near - field . </S>",
    "<S> thus   the wave retains its x - shape in the physical space @xmath18 and turns out to be superluminal ( @xmath19 ( in the   fourier - transformable stationary regime no general theorem about causality and maxwell equations is violated @xcite , as discussed extensively in the literature @xcite ) .    when @xmath20 the x in the spectrum is curved and subluminal propagation is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in general these localized waves have infinite energy , and only approximations can be realized in practice ( as for non - diffracting bessel beams @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> solutions with finite energy , though no longer propagation - invariant , have been also reported.@xcite in the case of dispersive media the situation is more complicated ( the general angular spectra is given by @xmath21 , encompassing evanescent waves ) . however , strongly dispersive elements such as axicon and diffraction gratings   @xcite or computer holograms @xcite permit to generate x - waves .    henceforth , we consider sh generation in the undepleted pump approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the paraxial and narrowband complex envelope amplitude @xmath22 at sh carrier frequency @xmath23 obeys the following equation @xmath24 where   @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) is the nonlinear phase mismatch , @xmath28 the usual nonlinear coefficient such that @xmath29 and   @xmath30 are measured in @xmath31 , and @xmath32 stands for a loss term which is included for technical convenience , though we will take the limit @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we also neglect second - order dispersions @xmath34 , since in practical cases their effects are usually small with respect to the dominant first - order dispersion measured by the group delay @xmath35 , @xmath36 being inverse group - velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of eq.([eq : main ] ) requires also a broad ( radially symmetric ) pump beam so that its diffraction can be neglected , resulting into a pump amplitude @xmath37 const . , or in other words into a pump beam traveling undistorted at velocity @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> under these hypothesis , eq.([eq : main ] ) can be easily integrated in the spectral domain by making use of the fourier - bessel representation : @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of eq.([eq : main ] ) in terms of spectral variables @xmath40 reads  @xmath41- \\exp[i (   \\beta_2   \\omega-\\kappa^2/2k_2+i\\epsilon)z ] } { (   \\beta_1   -   \\beta_2   ) \\omega-\\delta k+\\kappa^2/2k_2-i\\epsilon } \\text{.}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the fourier - bessel transform of the source term @xmath43 in eq.([eq : main ] ) , and we have considered , for sake of simplicity , the unseeded case , i.e. @xmath44 . note that the denominator in eq.([eq : solfb ] ) represents ( for @xmath45 ) the expansion of the mismatch @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> consistently with our hypothesis , we limit the analysis to the case @xmath47 ( when @xmath48 , the effect of @xmath49 becomes relevant and will be addressed in the future ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse   transform of eq.([eq : solfb ] ) in the lossless limit ( @xmath45 ) can be obtained by applying residue theorems . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath50 whenever @xmath51 , or @xmath52 , and @xmath53 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\int_0^\\infty x(\\kappa ) j_0(\\kappa r ) e^{i\\frac{\\kappa^2}{2\\,k_2}\\frac{t-   \\beta_1   z } {   \\beta_1   -   \\beta_2   } }  \\kappa d\\kappa\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] elsewhere ( see fig.[figure1 ] for a pictorial representation of the support of @xmath54 ) , with @xmath55 $ ] determined by the pump spectrum . hence in the region covered by the sh ( travelling at speed @xmath56 ) </S>",
    "<S> which is emitted in the center of the ff beam , @xmath54 is given by a _ non - diffracting beam which propagates at the group velocity of the ff_. indeed , eq.([eq : mainresult ] ) shows that the intensity @xmath29 depends on @xmath57 only through the combination @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> only one - half of the localized wave is generated due to causality : the peak moves at the ff group velocity , while its costituents ( the sh beam ) moves at their characteristic velocity @xmath59 . as a result , the temporal extension of the wave is equal to @xmath60 ( see fig.[figure1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to what has been theoretically predicted for practical finite - aperture realizations of vacuum localized waves . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as in that case , it can been shown that the @xmath54 field is the sum of two x - waves which cancel each other in the non - causal regions , a form of the extintion theorem . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the source - sink picture developed by saari @xcite , only the source cone is present ( as physically reasonable ) .    </S>",
    "<S> equation([eq : mainresult ] ) strongly resembles the vacuum nondiffracting beams developed in   @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , since we are dealing with a dispersive medium , we need to prove that the wave in eq.([eq : mainresult ] )   belongs to the class given by ( [ eq : xformula ] ) . consistently with the validity of eq.([eq : main ] ) , we make the paraxial approximation @xmath61^{1/2 } \\cong k(\\omega)-\\kappa^2/2k(\\omega)$ ] , and then expand @xmath62 around @xmath63 at first - order , to end up ( neglecting space - time coupling terms such as @xmath64 ) with @xmath65 , where @xmath66 . by equating this expression of   @xmath67 to that in eq.([eq : xdispersion ] ) , we can express the frequency as @xmath68 , which , after substitution in eq.([eq : xformula ] ) , yields @xmath69 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ % \\frac{1 } { k_{2}(\\beta_x   -   \\beta_2 )   } \\int_0^\\infty x'(\\kappa ) j_0(\\kappa r)e^{i\\frac{\\kappa^2}{2k_2}\\frac{t- \\beta_x   z } { \\beta_x - \\beta_2   } } \\kappa d\\kappa\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a suitable redefinition of the spectrum @xmath13 and @xmath71 $ ] is the optical carrier .   the field in eq.([eq : xasymptotic ] ) </S>",
    "<S> has exactly the same form of that reported in eq.([eq : mainresult ] ) , once we account for the fact that the latter is an envelope which multiply the carrier @xmath72 . by comparing eq.([eq : xasymptotic ] ) and eq.([eq : mainresult ] ) we find that the parameters of the x - wave are directly related to those of the mixing process as @xmath73    therefore , our calculation shows that , for undepleted frequency doubling , the x - wave dispersion constraint ( [ eq : xdispersion ] ) is automatically satisfied and takes the form @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly the angular dispersion is given by the equation ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the cone angle ) @xmath77 which is an horizontal parabola in the angle - detuning plane , with position and convessity determined by the dispersive features of the process ( group - delay and @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> its experimental observation would be a clear signature of the presence of angular dispersion and of the formation of sh - xwaves . from eq.([eq : mainresult ] ) we can determine the energy of the sh @xmath79 , where @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 grows linearly during propagation , its finiteness being a consequence of the x - wave compact support , and hence of causality . to make a practical example we assume the ff amplitude given by a gaussian pulsed beam with waist @xmath82 and duration @xmath83 : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath84 $ ] . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 can be evaluated explicitly yielding @xmath86\\text{,}\\ ] ] with @xmath87 the ff energy , @xmath88 ,  @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq : energygaussian ] ) shows that for large @xmath91 the energy conversion is negligibile , while the maximum efficiency is obtained for a particular value of @xmath78 ( in general @xmath92 ) which can evaluated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> choosing realistic parameters @xcite ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ps / m , @xmath96 ) , we have @xmath97 , and the maximum conversion efficiency is attained for @xmath98 , i.e. the inverse spatial separation between ff and sh associated with   @xmath83 .    </S>",
    "<S> at last we wish to point out that different ( often equivalent ) terms are adopted to classify localized waves . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , eq.([eq : xformula ] ) defines the so - called _ focus waves mode _ ( fwm ) , a more general class than x - waves , according to the literature.@xcite however we are dealing with narrowband optical wavepackets , and hence fwm are known as x - bessel @xcite . on the other hand eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mainresult ] ) resembles the _ focused x - waves _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .   </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the causality implies that only one - half of the double cone is generated , and thus they can be identified with the so - called y- , or hankel- , waves . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the sake of simplicity we used the term `` x - wave '' from the beginning .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have theoretically predicted that the process of optical frequency doubling can lead to an x - wave , traveling at the ff velocity , whose @xmath14 parameter is directly linked to the wavevector mismatch . for a given input ff wave , </S>",
    "<S> the x - wave can be modified by acting on the mixing control knobs ( e.g. crystal temperature or orientation ) , while the resulting angular spectra ( the far field ) is given by horizontal parabolas [ eq.([eq : xspectrum ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism appears to be a valid alternative to the generation of optical localized - waves by means of _ linear _ techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> this result is also susceptible of a different interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the morphogenesy into x - waves occurs spontaneously reveals the fundamental role that they can have in any ultrafast   parametric process ( e.g. four - wave mixing or optical parametric amplification ) where the generalized phase - matching condition produces the correlation between spatial and temporal degrees of freedom which is behind the x - shape of the wavepacket . by studying such phenomena , </S>",
    "<S> the generation of new parametric sources could be conceived .    </S>",
