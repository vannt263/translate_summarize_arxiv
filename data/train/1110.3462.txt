    "it is well known that in general relativity a neutral rotating black hole in asymptotically flat and matter - free spacetime is described completely by the kerr metric only with two parameters , the mass @xmath2 and the rotation parameter @xmath3 , which is supported by the well - known no - hair theorem @xcite .",
    "this means that all astrophysical black holes in our universe should be kerr black holes .",
    "although there exists a large amount of observational evidences for the existence of black holes , a definite proof is still lacking at present . in order to test the no - hair theorem ,",
    "several potential approaches has been suggested using observations including gravitational waves from extreme mass - ratio inspirals @xcite and the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the accreting disk around black holes @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , all of these methods are based on spacetimes that deviate from the kerr metric by one or more parameters @xcite .",
    "the compact object is a kerr black hole only if the deviations are measured to be zero .    to test the no - hair theorem , johannsen _ et al _",
    "@xcite applied recently the newman - janis transformation @xcite and constructed a deformed kerr - like black hole metric , which describes a rotating black hole beyond general relativity .",
    "this rotating black hole possess some striking properties .",
    "besides the mass @xmath2 and the rotation parameter @xmath3 , it has a deformation parameter which measures potential deviations from the kerr geometry in the strong - field regime . especially , there are no restrictions on the values of the rotation parameter @xmath3 and the deformation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "thus , it is allowable that the rotation parameter is larger than the mass of the black hole in this alternative gravity theory , which is different from that in einstein s general relativity .",
    "moreover , the radius of horizon of the rotating non - kerr black hole depends on the polar angular coordinate @xmath4 and the spacetime is free of closed timelike curves outside of the outer horizon @xcite .",
    "if the black hole is more prolate than a kerr black hole ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) , there exist two disconnected spherical horizons for high rotation parameter , but there is no horizon for @xmath6 .",
    "if the black hole is more oblate than a kerr black hole ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , the horizon always exists for the arbitrary @xmath3 and the topology of the horizon becomes toroidal @xcite . in the weak field approximation",
    ", such a black hole possesses the same asymptotic behaviors of the usual kerr black hole in general relativity @xcite .",
    "motivated by testing gravity in the strong field region , a lot of efforts has been recently dedicated to the study of the rotating non - kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the accretion processes is a powerful indicator of the physical nature of the central celestial objects , which means that the analysis of the signatures of the accretion disk around the rotating non - kerr black hole could help us to detect gravity effects in the strong field regime in which general relativity breaks down .",
    "the accretion disk is such a structure formed by the diffuse material in orbital motion around a central compact body , which now is an important research topic in the astrophysics .",
    "the steady - state thin accretion disk model is the simplest theoretical model of the accretion disks , in which the disk has negligible thickness so that the heat generated by stress and dynamic friction in the disk can be dispersed through the radiation over its surface @xcite .",
    "this cooling mechanism ensures that the disk can be in hydrodynamical equilibrium and the mass accretion rate in the disk maintains a constant , which is independent of time variable .",
    "the physical properties of matter forming a thin accretion disk in a variety of background spacetimes have been investigated extensively in @xcite .",
    "the special signatures appeared in the energy flux and the emission spectrum emitted by the disk can provide us not only the information about black holes in the universe , but also the profound verification of alternative theories of gravity .",
    "the marginally stable orbit for the particle and the conversion efficiency of the central object converting rest mass into outgoing radiation have been studied in the background of a rotating non - kerr black hole @xcite , which tells us that with the increase of the deformed parameter @xmath0 , the marginally stable orbit radius @xmath8 decreases and the conversion efficiency increases . however , the effects of the deformation parameter on the energy flux , the radiation temperature , the spectra luminosity and the spectra cut - off frequency is still open .",
    "the main purpose of the present letter is to study the properties of the thin accretion disk in the rotating non - kerr black hole spacetime and see whether it can leave us the signature of the deformation parameter in the energy flux and the emission spectrum emitted in the mass accretion process .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in the following section we will review briefly the rotating no - kerr black hole metric proposed by johannsen _ et al _ @xcite to test the no - hair theorem in the strong field regime , and then present the geodesic equations for the timelike particles moving in the equatorial plane in this background . in sec.iii , we study the physical properties of the thin accretion disk around the rotating no - kerr black hole and probe the effects of the deformation parameter on the energy flux , temperature and emission spectrum of the thin accretion disks onto this black hole .",
    "we end the letter with a summary .",
    "let us now review briefly the rotating no - kerr black hole metric , which is proposed by johannsen _",
    "et al _ @xcite to test gravity in the strong field regime .",
    "starting from a deformed schwarzschild solution and applying the newman - janis transformation , they constructed a deformed kerr - like metric which describes a stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "it contains three parameters : the mass @xmath2 , the rotation parameter @xmath3 , and the deformation parameter @xmath0 . in the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates",
    ", the metric of this rotating no - kerr black hole has a form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 + \\frac{a^2(\\rho^2 + 2mr)\\sin^4\\theta}{\\rho^2}h,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 the deformed parameter @xmath5 or @xmath7 corresponds to the cases in which the compact object is more prolate or oblate than a kerr black hole , respectively . as @xmath12 , the black hole",
    "is reduced to the usual kerr black hole in general relativity .",
    "the horizon of the black hole is given by @xcite @xmath13 clearly , the radius of horizon depends on @xmath4 , which is different from that in the usual kerr case . for the case @xmath5",
    ", one can find that there exist two disconnected spherical horizons for high spin parameters , but there is no horizon for @xmath6 .",
    "however , for @xmath7 one can find that the horizon never disappears for the arbitrary @xmath3 and the shape of the horizon becomes toroidal @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can find that it is free of closed timelike curves and then causality is satisfied outside of the event horizon @xcite .    according to the thin accretion disk model",
    ", one can assumes that the disk is on the equatorial plane and that the matter moves on nearly geodesic circular orbits . in the rotating non - kerr black hole spacetime ( [ metric0 ] ) ,",
    "the timelike geodesics equations of a particle can be expressed as @xmath14 with the effective potential @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the specific energy and the specific angular momentum of the particle , respectively .",
    "the circular equatorial orbits obey the conditions @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite . due to the refection symmetry of the metric ( [ metric0 ] ) with respect to the equatorial plane",
    ", one can find that the condition @xmath20 is satisfied naturally for the particles locating at the plane @xmath21 .",
    "making use of these conditions , we can get the specific energy @xmath16 , the specific angular momentum @xmath17 , and the angular velocity @xmath22 of the particle moving in circular orbit on the equatorial plane in the rotating non - kerr black hole spacetime @xmath23 the circular orbits are stable under small perturbations in the radial direction if @xmath24 , and in the vertical direction if @xmath25 @xcite . in the background of a kerr black hole in general relativity ,",
    "the second condition is always satisfied , so one can obtain the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit by solving @xmath26",
    ". however , in the rotating black hole beyond general relativity , the marginally stable orbit radius is determined by the condition @xmath26 or @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in a rotating non - kerr black hole ( [ metric0 ] ) , one can not obtain an analytical form of the marginally stable orbit radius from these conditions . in order to get the marginally stable orbit radius",
    ", we must resort to numerical method . in fig.(1 ) , we set @xmath28 and plotted the variety of the marginally stable orbit radius @xmath8 with the deformed parameter @xmath0 in the rotating non - kerr black hole spacetime .",
    "when the black hole is oblate than a kerr black hole ( @xmath7 ) , one can find that the radius @xmath8 decreases with the deformed parameter @xmath0 and the rotation parameter @xmath3 , which is similar that in the kerr black hole spacetime .",
    "this is also shown in @xcite . when the black hole is prolate ( @xmath5 ) , the dependence of the marginally stable orbit radius @xmath8 on the deformed parameter @xmath0 becomes more complicated .",
    "let us now first to discuss the case where the particle rotates in the same direction to this prolate black hole ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "as the parameter @xmath30 , the marginally stable orbit radius @xmath8 is defined by the radial instability as in the oblate black hole case and @xmath8 decreases with the deformed parameter @xmath0 .     with the parameter @xmath0 for the thin disk around the rapidly - rotating non - kerr black hole.,width=302 ]    .the change of the critical values @xmath31 ,",

    "here we set @xmath28 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    as @xmath34 , there are two disconnected regimes where stable circular orbits exist : an outer zone with @xmath35 and an inner zone with @xmath36",
    ". since the energy and angular momentum of the orbit in the inner zone are higher than that in the outer zone , an object inspiraling from large distances on a circular equatorial orbit will reach @xmath37 and plunge into the central body , rather than finding itself in the inner range of circular orbits .",
    "this means that the marginally stable orbit radius @xmath8 is consistent with @xmath37 , which is defined by the vertical instability .",
    "one can see that in this regime the marginally stable orbit radius @xmath8 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "those properties of @xmath8 are similar to those of in the manko - novikov metric @xcite . as @xmath38 , the outer zone",
    "is connected with the inner zone .",
    "however , the energy and angular momentum of the orbit are positive and real only if @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the effective marginally stable orbit is at @xmath40 and increases with @xmath0 , which is different from that in the background of a manko - novikov spacetime @xcite .",
    "moreover , we also find that the effective marginally stable orbit radius @xmath40 is independent of @xmath3 for the larger @xmath0 .",
    "the critical values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are listed in the table ( 1 ) for different rotation parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that both @xmath41 and @xmath42 decrease with @xmath3 . for the particle rotating in the opposite direction to the black hole ( @xmath43 )",
    ", we find as the deformed parameter @xmath0 is less than a certain critical value @xmath33 , the marginally stable orbit radius is defined by the radial instability as in the previous discussion , which @xmath8 decreases monotonously with @xmath0 . as @xmath44 , we find that only in the region where the energy and angular momentum of the orbit are positive and real , the orbit is stable under small perturbations both in the radial direction and in the vertical direction since both of the conditions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are satisfied . thus , the effective marginally stable orbit is still at @xmath40 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath33 increases with the absolute value of @xmath3 as is shown in table ( 1 ) .",
    "moreover , we note that for the value of @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath32 for @xmath29 and than @xmath33 for @xmath43 , the marginally stable orbit radius is independent of the rotation parameter @xmath3 .",

    "<S> in which the black hole is more oblate than a kerr black hole , the larger deviation leads to the smaller energy flux , the lower radiation temperature and the fainter spectra luminosity in the disk . for the black hole with positive deformed parameter , we find that the effect of the deformed parameter on the disk becomes more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> it depends not only on the rotation direction of the black hole and the orbit particles , but also on the sign of the difference between the deformed parameter @xmath0 and a certain critical value @xmath1 . </S>",
