    "starting with the pioneering work of jepsen  @xcite and harris  @xcite , the study of tagged particle motion has been an area of very active research .",
    "much of the earlier studies focused @xcite on the statistics of the typical displacement of the tagged particle , in particular on the mean square displacement in various single - file systems .",
    "one of the most interesting result is that , for a hamiltonian one - dimensional gas of hard particles which move ballistically between elastic collisions , a tagged particle moves _ diffusively _ , thus the mean square displacement of the tagged particle , in a time duration @xmath0 increases as @xmath3 . on the other hand , for a gas of brownian particles with hard - core interactions ,",
    "the tagged particle motion is _ sub - diffusive _ , with @xmath4 .",
    "the typical fluctuations of the tagged particle displacement is described by a gaussian distribution with the above variance .",
    "recently there has been interest in studying the probability of _ atypical _ fluctuations of the tagged particle displacement @xcite .",
    "some of the results for these simple classical interacting particle models have been useful in obtaining results for one - dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "a number of different theoretical approaches have been used to study the probability distribution of the tagged particle displacement .",
    "these include the original ideas of jepsen and harris of mapping to a non - interacting system , exact solution of multi - particle fokker - planck equation with reflecting boundary condition between neighboring particles , and the recently developed approach of macroscopic fluctuation theory . in our recent works",
    "@xcite , we have shown a simpler way ( as opposed to earlier approaches in @xcite ) of using the non - interacting picture to computing tagged particle statistics . in the present work ,",
    "we extend this method to study a particular two particle distribution , defined below .",
    "we consider a hard - point particle system on the infinite line .",
    "the particles are distributed uniformly with a finite density @xmath5 . for the case of hamiltonian dynamics ( of equal mass particles ) ,",
    "the initial velocities are taken to be independent and identically distributed random variables .",
    "the particles move ballistically in between elastic binary collisions . during collisions ,",
    "the two colliding particles merely interchange their velocities . as a result ,",
    "any set of particle trajectories of the interacting system can be constructed from the set of trajectories of a non - interacting system ( where the trajectories pass through each other )  by exchanging the identities ( tags ) of the particles at crossing . for the case of brownian particles with hard - point interactions ,",
    "harris @xcite defined the interacting particle problem by starting with the non - interacting trajectories and exchanging particle identities whenever two trajectories cross .",
    "this definition is equivalent to enforcing reflecting boundary conditions between nearest neighbor pairs in the full multi - particle propagator ( thus each particle acts like a hard reflecting wall for its nearest neighbors ) .",
    "one can generalize this collision rule to other cases where the individual particle dynamics is neither hamiltonian or brownian , for example lvy walks or fractional brownian motion .",
    "hence in general we define the interacting problem as follows : start with the non - interacting trajectories and interchange particle labels whenever two trajectories cross .    for this general interacting particle system ,",
    "let us tag two particles with tag indices @xmath6 and @xmath1 , such that there are @xmath7 particles in between them .",
    "let the position of these particles be @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "here we consider the displacement @xmath10 and compute it s statistics .",
    "( color online ) an interacting hard - point particles system can be constructed from a non - interacting system by exchanging tags ( colors ) when two trajectories cross . ]",
    "initially , we consider @xmath11 particles , independently and uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath12 $ ] and evolve them on the infinite one dimensional line .",
    "since during a collision each particle acts as a reflecting hard wall for the other and the particles are identical , one can effectively treat the system of the interacting hard - point particles as non - interacting by exchanging the identities of the particles emerging from collisions [ see and discussion in previous section ] . in the non - interacting picture",
    ", each particle executes an independent motion and the particles _ pass through each other _ when they ` collide ' .",
    "the position of each particle at time @xmath0 is given independently by a single - particle propagator of the general form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the dependence on time only appears through the characteristic displacement @xmath16 in time @xmath0 . while for stochastic processes",
    "the propagator arises naturally , for hamiltonian systems ( where the dynamics is deterministic ) it comes from the distribution , taken to be of the form @xmath17 , from which the initial velocities of the particles are chosen independently . in many problems of interest , the propagator happens to be gaussian , i.e. , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the variance .",
    "for example , for brownian particles , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient , while for hamiltonian dynamics with gaussian velocity distribution we have @xmath22 .",
    "similarly for fractional brownian motion , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hurst exponent .",
    "however , our analysis is valid for any general propagator .",
    "note that the dependence on time only appears through the characteristic displacement @xmath16 in time @xmath0 .",
    "we mark the position by @xmath25 of the @xmath26 particle at @xmath27 and the position @xmath28 of the @xmath29 particle at time @xmath0 . in this example , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "let @xmath32 , be the difference between these two positions .",
    "our goal is to study the statistical properties of this random variable @xmath33 , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath34 , @xmath35 while keeping @xmath36 fixed . in this limit , in the bulk",
    ", the statistics of @xmath33 should depend only on the difference of the tags @xmath37 , rather than the individual tags @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "this represents the usual problem of tagged particle displacement , studied in @xcite .    in the following",
    "we proceed with the calculation using the non - interacting picture discussed above .",

    "the interaction dynamics is specified by imposing that , we start with the non - interacting trajectories , and then interchange particle labels whenever trajectories cross  thus the ordering of particle labels is maintained at all times .",
    "this dynamics is quite natural for the deterministic so - called jepsen gas and also for non - crossing brownian walkers , and also seems natural for other stochastic processes .",
    "using the fact that a mapping to non - interacting particles is available we have developed a formalism that seems to be very suited to computing reduced distribution functions and correlation functions in the interacting system . in particular , here we focus on computing the joint distribution of the positions of two tagged particles at different times .",
    "this is obtained exactly and from this we extract the large deviation function , various cumulants . for the case of hamiltonian dynamics , we show that the two - pont velocity autocorrelation function can also be computed .",
    "we expect that the general strategy of our approach will be useful in the computation of more complicated correlations and distribution functions .",
    "we thank the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics for the hospitality and the infn for partial support during the completion of this work ."
