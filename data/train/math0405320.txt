    "many stimulating problems in mathematics owe their existence to variational formulations of physical phenomena . in differential geometry , harmonic maps , candidate minimisers of the dirichlet energy , can be described as constraining a rubber sheet to fit on a marble manifold in a position of elastica equilibrium , i.e. without tension  @xcite .",
    "however , when this scheme falls through , and it can , as corroborated by the case of the two - torus and the two - sphere  @xcite , a best map will minimise this failure , measured by the total tension , called bienergy . in the more geometrically meaningful context of immersions , the fact that the tension field is normal to the image submanifold , suggests that the most effective deformations must be sought in the normal direction .",
    "then , two approaches to this optimization are available : the first one ( the free state ) consists in finding ( normal ) extrema of the bienergy , with complete disregard for the behaviour of the energy . in the second , in order to avoid paying too great a price for a smaller tension , a constancy condition on the energy level is imposed . in more intuitive terms , and even though we never consider the associated flows , these points of view correspond , at least in the more favorable situations , to reducing the overall tension of a surface , with or without controlling the mean curvature .",
    "however different , both outlooks are unified into a single mathematical description , amounting to a lagrange multiplier interpretation",
    ".    this considerations lead to the following definitions .",
    "a map @xmath0 between riemannian manifolds is called _ biharmonic _ if it is a critical point , for all variations , of the bienergy functional : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the tension field , vanishing for critical points of the dirichlet energy ( i.e. harmonic maps ) : @xmath3 in case of non - compact domain , these two definitions should be understood as for all compact subsets .",
    "the euler - lagrange operator attached to biharmonicity , called the _ bitension field _ and computed by jiang in  @xcite , is : @xmath4 and vanishes if and only if the map @xmath5 is biharmonic .",
    "we are now ready to define the main object of this paper .",
    "an immersion @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) between riemannian manifolds , or its image , is called _ biminimal _ if it is a critical point of the bienergy functional @xmath8 for variations normal to the image @xmath9 , with fixed energy .",
    "equivalently , there exists a constant @xmath10 such that @xmath5 is a critical point of the @xmath11-bienergy @xmath12 for any smooth variation of the map @xmath13-\\epsilon , + \\epsilon [ \\times m \\to n$ ] , @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 is normal to @xmath16 .",
    "the functional @xmath17 has been on the mathematical scene since the early seventies ( see  @xcite ) , where its critical points , for all possible variations , are studied . in particular , it is shown to satisfy condition  ( c ) when the domain has dimension two or three and the target is non - positively curved , ensuring the existence of minimisers in each homotopy class",
    ". however , l.  lemaire , in  @xcite , constructs counter - examples when no condition is imposed on the curvature .    using the euler - lagrange equations for harmonic and biharmonic maps , we see that an immersion is biminimal if @xmath18^{\\perp}=[\\tau_{2}]^{\\perp}- \\lambda [ \\tau]^{\\perp}=0,\\ ] ] for some value of @xmath19 , where @xmath20^{\\perp}$ ] denotes the normal component of @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we call an immersion _ free _ biminimal if it is biminimal for @xmath21 .    in the instance of an isometric immersion @xmath22",
    ", the biminimal condition is @xmath23^{\\perp}+\\lambda { \\mathbf h } = 0.\\ ] ]    note that this variational principle is close to the willmore problem , the disparity being that we do not vary through isometric immersions .",
    "while it is obvious that biharmonic immersions are biminimal , we will see in the following sections that the two notions are well distinct .",
    "for example , we construct families of biminimal surfaces in three - dimensional space forms of non - positive constant sectional curvature where biharmonic surfaces do not exist @xcite . in the same vein",
    ", we construct families of biminimal surfaces in almost all three - dimensional geometries of thurston .    _",
