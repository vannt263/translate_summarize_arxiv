    "long before massive black holes were accepted to be present in the centers of galaxies , @xcite argued that a binary black hole created in the merger of two galaxies would eject stars from the center of the newly created system as the binary slowly hardened .",
    "n - body simulations support this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "we now believe that nearly every elliptical galaxy or spiral bulge has a black hole at its center @xcite .",
    "we also believe that the most massive elliptical galaxies were formed by merging pre - existing galaxies .",
    "it is possible that their central structure still bears witness to such events .",
    "the `` cores '' seen at the centers of the most luminous elliptical galaxies may indeed be the signatures of gravitational stirring and heating ( `` core scouring '' ) by binary black holes @xcite .",
    "cores were initially seen in ground - based observations of nearby luminous elliptical galaxies as a central region of nearly constant surface brightness @xcite .",
    "the cores were seen to be non - isothermal , but their true form as @xmath6 was unknown .",
    "_ hst _ images , however , later showed that nearly all galaxies have singular starlight distributions in the sense that surface brightness diverges as @xmath7 @xcite . typically , in low luminosity",

    "resolution limit ; @xcite classified these systems as `` power - law '' galaxies . in more luminous galaxies ,",
    "however , the steep envelope profile transitions to a shallow inner cusp with @xmath10 at a `` break radius , '' @xmath11 this behavior was seen in galaxies that had cores from ground - based observations ; the break radius roughly corresponded to what had been measured as the core radius .",
    "we thus chose to continue to call these `` core galaxies , '' even though the shallow cusps in projected brightness in most these systems thus have @xmath12 at small radii and do not have cusps in space density .",
    "] of these systems imply steep and singular cusps in luminosity density @xcite .",
    "a strong justification of this classification schema was that the distribution of @xmath13 over a sample of early - type galaxies was seen to be strongly bimodal @xcite , where @xmath13 is the local cusp slope at the _ hst _ resolution limit .",
    "initially no galaxies were seen to have @xmath14 it was thus sensible to apply the separate core and power - law classifications to the two distinct and cleanly separated peaks in the @xmath13 distribution .",
    "the bimodal distribution was initially inferred from fits to the surface photometry using the `` nuker law '' ( @xcite ; see equation [ eqn : nuker ] ) , which has the asymptotic form @xmath15 as @xmath16 however , @xcite demonstrated that non - parametric treatment of the surface photometry recovered an identical bimodal distribution , and further that bimodality was a feature of the luminosity _ density _ distributions of early type galaxies , not just the surface brightness distributions .",
    "the core and power - law classifications are fundamental because they correlate with global physical properties that are diagnostic of galaxy formation .",
    "core galaxies are on average more luminous than power - law galaxies , with power - laws dominating below @xmath17 and cores greatly dominating at higher luminosities @xcite .",
    "core galaxies generally have boxy isophotes , while power - law galaxies are disky @xcite .",
    "core galaxies rotate slowly , while power - law galaxies rotate more rapidly @xcite ; similarly , boxy galaxies include slow rotators while disky galaxies rotate rapidly @xcite .",
    "core - boxy galaxies show minor - axis rotation indicative of triaxiality , while coreless - disky galaxies do not @xcite .",
    "and core galaxies are systematically rounder than power - law galaxies @xcite , just as bright ( boxy ) galaxies are systematically rounder than faint ( disky ) galaxies @xcite . significantly ,",
    "core and power - law galaxies of identical luminosity can still be separated by all of these secondary characteristics @xcite .",
    "thus central and global properties together point to differences in the formation of core and power - law ellipticals .",
    "@xcite propose a revision of the hubble sequence for elliptical galaxies that recognizes this physical dichotomy , using isophote shape as a convenient surrogate for the above physical properties .",
    "more recent work continues to show that power - law and core galaxies have physically distinct properties .",
    "cores @xcite , like boxy isophotes @xcite , correlate with radio - loud active nuclei . and",
    "cores @xcite , like boxy isophotes @xcite , correlate with strong x - ray emission .",
    "the properties of the power - law versus core galaxies suggest that core systems resulted from the mergers of less luminous power - law systems .",
    "simulations by @xcite , for example , showed that the merger of two power - law galaxies , each with a central massive black hole , would produce a core galaxy .",
    "the bimodal cusp distribution would thus be one key to understanding the central structure of elliptical galaxies over a history of mergers .    as larger samples of elliptical galaxies were observed with _ hst _ , the bimodal slope distribution remained robust @xcite . while all of these studies identified a small number of `` intermediate '' galaxies , which have limiting cusp slopes with @xmath18 they are not common enough to fill the `` valley '' between the power - law and core cusp - slope distributions .",
    "this is a critical point that has often been misunderstood in the literature .",
    "the sample of galaxies available to @xcite had no systems with @xmath18 thus the distributions of slopes was not only bimodal , but disjoint .",
    "the subsequent discovery of a small number of intermediate galaxies shows that the distribution of cusp slopes is truly continuous , but it has remained bimodal in its overall character in all the studies cited above .",
    "this picture has been challenged by the recent distribution of cusp slopes presented by @xcite , who do not find bimodality in their sample of 100 galaxies observed by their _",
    "virgo cluster survey ( vcs ) , although they still identify a separate class of core galaxies , which they define as having brightness profiles that fall below @xcite forms in the center .",
    "while the use of s ' ersic  profiles is a new approach to identifying core galaxies , the class of vcs core galaxies identified in this way is essentially consistent with the definition of core galaxies in earlier studies .",
    "the distribution of slopes for the non - core galaxies in @xcite , however , does not match that of the power - law galaxies presented in all the studies cited above , even though this set includes several galaxies previously classified as power - laws .",
    "the difference between the vcs work and all earlier studies lies not in whether or not there are two classes of galaxies , core and `` non - core '' , but in the form of the central structure of the non - core class .",
    "resolving the different pictures presented by @xcite and the vcs results is crucial to understanding how the central structure of elliptical galaxies varies with luminosity , and how it may change over mergers .",
    "this paper has three goals .",
    "we first construct a large sample of galaxies that have had their surface brightness distributions characterized by nuker law fits .",
    "these are reduced to a common photometric and distance scale .",
    "this sample provides the basic material for an updated investigation into the relationships between the central structure of galaxies and their more global properties , as was presented in @xcite ; this new analysis is presented in @xcite .",
    "the second goal is to reinvestigate the distribution of cusp slopes in early type galaxies .",
    "we find that the distribution of slopes remains strongly bimodal , a conclusion that we ratify with a repeat of the non - parametric analysis presented by @xcite .",
    "the final task is to bolster this conclusion with a comparison of the analysis of _ hst _ imagery by @xcite to that of @xcite .",
    "we show that the vcs surface photometry models do not accurately recover the distribution of @xmath13 for galaxies with @xmath19",
    "we define a combined sample of 219 early - type galaxies observed with _",
    "hst _ for which nuker - law parameters have been derived by a variety of studies @xcite .",
    "the global properties of the sample galaxies are listed in table [ tab : glob ] .",
    "the nuker law parameterizations of the central structure of the galaxies are listed in table [ tab : cen ] .",
    "the investigations cited above were generally done in different photometric bands , and used a variety of sources for galaxy distances , luminosities , and so on .",
    "we have adopted the f555w or _",
    "v _ band as the common photometric system , which was the choice of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we also specify the absolute galaxy luminosities in the _ v _ band .",
    "luminosities are based on the @xmath20 apparent magnitudes published in the rc3 @xcite , with the exception of a few galaxies that had to be transformed from @xmath21 and the @xcite bgc sample , which provided total magnitudes in the @xmath1 band .",
    "morphologies are also provided by the rc3 .",
    "many of the galaxies in the sample are s0 systems rather than true ellipticals . as bulge parameters , rather than those of the whole galaxy , are relevant to the properties of central black holes @xcite , we have corrected ( when possible ) the total luminosities of the s0 galaxies for their disk components .",
    "most of the corrections were based on the bulge - disk decompositions of @xcite ; other decompositions were provided by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "when a galaxy appeared in multiple sources we selected the median disk correction .",
    "the final disk corrections and sources are given in table [ tab : glob ] .",
    "calculation of absolute magnitudes is complicated by the heterogeneous quality of distance information across the sample .",
    "we set the overall scale to @xmath22 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 and have reworked the distances in all references .",
    "our preferred source of distances is the @xcite surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) survey , but using the group memberships in @xcite and averaging the sbf distances over the group .",
    "as the @xcite sbf scale is consistent with @xmath24 however , we scale up their sbf distances by 6% . for galaxies not in the sbf catalogue but that are in the @xcite sample , we rescale the distances in that paper from its scale of @xmath25 for galaxies not in either sample , we check for possible membership in the @xcite group catalogues , using the group velocity in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) frame , if a group sbf distance is not available .",
    "lastly , if no group information is available , we use the galaxy s velocity in the cmb frame .",
    "the distances adopted are given in table [ tab : glob ] ; the distance references listed correspond to the four choices , in order of priority , that we have listed here .",
    "absolute luminosities were calculated using the @xcite galactic extinction values .",
    "table [ tab : glob ] also lists the major - axis effective radii of the galaxies .",
    "effective radii were determined by fitting @xmath26-laws to ground - based surface photometry profiles available in the published literature ( lauer et al ; in preparation ) ; unfortunately , supporting ground - based surface photometry could not be located for 30%of the sample .",
    "no attempt was made to fit s0 galaxies with separate bulge and disk components , so the effective radii may be suspect when the disk contributes significantly to the total galaxy luminosity . under these general guidelines , we discuss the specific details and treatment applied to each data source for the sample .",

    "the selection of galaxies was heavily influenced by the central - structure parameter relationships presented by @xcite .",
    "several galaxies were chosen to sample the luminosity range over which power - law and core galaxies coexist , to explore the transition between the two types .",
    "others were selected to extend the luminosity range of the core parameter relationships .",

    "adopted @xmath34 as the resolution limit of their profiles , using the cusp slope at this radius for profile classification .",
    "we consider this resolution limit to be unduly conservative for deconvolved wfpc2 images , and thus used their nuker fits at @xmath28 instead to determine @xmath35 as a result , all `` intermediate '' galaxies in rest et al .",
    "are considered here to have resolved cores , while a number of their power - law galaxies are now classified as intermediates ( see the note column in table [ tab : cen ] ) .",
    "@xcite obtained wfpc2 pc1 images of 81 brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in the f814w filter .",
    "the bcg sample was drawn from the volume - limited bcg sample of @xcite .",
    "the photometry was derived from deconvolved images ; the nuker law parameters are combined into the sample , using @xmath36 to transform the f814w photometry to f555w , and @xmath37 to transform the @xmath1 total galaxy apparent magnitudes listed in @xcite .",
    "bcg distances were based on the cmb - frame cluster velocities tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the core parameter relationships presented in @xcite were largely based on the @xcite photometry , but supplemented with a small set of otherwise unpublished wfpc1 gto galaxies observed and reduced in parallel with the @xcite galaxies .",

    "however , we have re - fitted the photometry for this paper to allow for @xmath39 and in some cases have restricted the radial range of the fits to better isolate the break radius and inner cusp .",
    "the new parameters are also referenced to the major - axis of the galaxies rather than to their mean - radii as was done in @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed 27 early - type galaxies in the @xmath2 band with nicmos2 ; the sample was largely based on bright nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "quillen et al .",

    "the sample selection in part required galaxy apparent magnitude @xmath42 and a northern declination .",
    "ravindranath et al . did not deconvolve their images but chose instead to fit psf - convolved nuker laws directly to the images ; they also included a central point - source in their fits .",

    "photometry to f555w using @xmath43 and @xmath44 for galaxy apparent magnitudes .",
    "again we use @xmath34 as the limiting resolution of this sample .",
    "there is significant overlap between the six sources that contribute to the sample .",
    "given the somewhat heterogeneous nature of the source material and reduction techniques , we have chosen to rank the sources in a preferred order , rather than to average or otherwise blend the parameters for any galaxy observed in more that one sample .",
    "our first preference is for the observations presented by @xcite ; as these were derived from f555w wfpc2 images , they have the best spatial resolution of the six studies used .",
    "our next preferences are for the the @xcite f702w profiles , and then the @xcite f814w profiles , as they have successively lower resolution , given the redder filters .",
    "while wfpc2 offers superior resolution to wfpc1 , deconvolved wfpc1 imagery should still be superior to nicmos observations made in the near - ir , so the galaxies in @xcite or @xcite that have no wfpc2 imagery are then next in order of preference .",
    "of the two nicmos programs , we prefer photometry from @xcite as they fitted photometry from the deconvolved images directly , rather than fitting psf - convolved models , which are more vulnerable to systematic errors .",
    "the nicmos programs also provided surface brightness parameters for a number of galaxies that were observed by wfpc2 , but that had centers so strongly affected by dust absorption that accurate nuker law parameters could not be measured in optical filters .",
    "as in our our previous analyses of the central structure of early - type galaxies @xcite , we classify the systems into two types , core and power - law galaxies , based on the logarithmic slopes , @xmath45 of their central cusps at the _ hst _ angular resolution limit , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the _ hst _ resolution scale or any other limiting radius . in the analysis that follows ,",
    "we represent @xmath48 with the `` nuker law '' @xcite parametric form @xmath49^{(\\gamma-\\beta)/\\alpha } , \\label{eqn : nuker}\\ ] ] which describes the profiles as a `` broken power law ; '' it is an extension of a broken power - law form first used to describe the brightness profile of m32 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath8 is the inner cusp slope as @xmath6 and is distinguished from @xmath45 which is the purely local slope evaluated at the resolution limit noted above .",
    "core galaxies are those that exhibit a well defined `` break radius , '' @xmath50 which marks a rapid transition ( moderated by @xmath51 ) from the outer steep envelope brightness profile ( which has asymptotic slope @xmath52 ) to a shallow cusp in surface brightness that generally persists as @xmath53 the break radius also marks the point of maximum curvature of the profile in logarithmic coordinates , and can thus be readily recognized by non - parametric means in addition to the use of the nuker law . in quantitative terms , core galaxies have @xmath54 the present sample contains 117 core galaxies .",
    "power - law galaxies retain a steep slope into the resolution limit , having @xmath55 these systems are also well described by the nuker law , but the breaks are poorly defined with small @xmath51 , or have @xmath8 only slightly smaller than @xmath56 the `` power - law '' appellation reflects the appearance of the brightness profiles of these systems in logarithmic coordinates .",
    "none of them are truly constant power - laws ; they generally have modest decreases in slope as @xmath53 the present sample contains 89 power - law galaxies .    as @xcite emphasized , we prefer to consider power - laws as galaxies that have no core resolved , rather than presuming that the galaxies intrinsically lack cores .",
    "a small number of galaxies classified as power - laws from wfpc1 or nicmos observations , for example , did reveal cores with the improved resolution of wfpc2 ( see the notes in table [ tab : cen ] ) .",
    "the power - law classification thus depends on context . since most cores measured so far have @xmath57 kpc ,",
    "clearly the physical resolution must be much better than this for the non - resolution of a core , and hence the power - law classification , to be interesting .",
    "conversely , the power - law classification has proved to be most intriguing for those galaxies with upper limits on @xmath58 well below those typical to galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "the sample also contains 13 galaxies that have @xmath18 which , following @xcite , are classified as `` intermediate '' galaxies .",
    "these systems are discussed further in @xmath59      as noted in the introduction , bimodality has been confirmed in work conducted subsequent to @xcite , with the exception of the @xcite vcs results . with the our combined large sample",
    ", we can now revisit the overall distribution of @xmath13 and retest the hypothesis that core and power - law galaxies can be described as two distinct populations .",
    "this is especially interesting as work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite has identified a number of `` intermediate '' galaxies that have @xmath18 thus falling between the core and power - law classes .",
    "the composition of the sample is well suited to the task of exploring bimodality , even though it is a composite of several _ hst _ samples .",
    "we are essentially using most of the nearby early - type galaxy observations that could contribute to such a test .",
    "the overall luminosity distribution of the sample is shown in figure [ fig : lum_hist ] .",
    "the sample is richest at just the luminosities required to explore the power - law / core transition , and falls off smoothly at both the bright and faint ends .",
    "the bright end of the sample is enhanced by the inclusion of bcgs , but as discussed below , we can test subsamples that exclude the bcgs directly , or all bright galaxies at large distances .",
    "we can also examine bimodality in a luminosity slice at the power - law / core transition luminosity , to counter concerns about the completeness of the sample at fainter and brighter luminosities .",
    "a separate concern might be the potential effects of different physical resolution limits within the sample , given that the galaxies are observed at a variety of distances , particularly if power - law galaxies are classified as such due to insufficient resolution .",
    "@xcite showed in their sample , however , that upper limits on the break radii for power - law galaxies fall well below the mean @xmath60 relationship at a given luminosity .",
    "this remains true in the present sample @xcite for all but the faintest power - law galaxies .",
    "power - law galaxies are not simply poorly resolved core galaxies .",
    "table [ tab : cen ] lists adopted @xmath13 values for the galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : gammap_all ] shows the new distribution of @xmath13 as a function of @xmath58 in angular units .",
    "the overall impression is that the distribution of @xmath13 remains strongly bimodal , even though several galaxies now clearly fall within @xmath14 the bimodality of the complete sample is strongly evident in the histogram of @xmath13 presented in figure [ fig : gam_hist ] .    rather than just relying on a visual assessment of bimodality , however",
    ", we can test for the statistical likelihood of bimodality using the kmm test described by @xcite .",
    "the kmm test compares the likelihood that the frequency distribution of a single parameter is drawn from the sum of two distinct gaussians versus a single gaussian distribution .",
    "as @xcite discuss , the most statistically rigorous test requires that the two gaussians in the bimodal composite distribution have the same dispersion , but the kmm algorithm can relax this assumption ; we test the @xmath13 distribution both ways .",
    "table [ tab : bimodal ] presents the gaussian parameters describing the distribution of @xmath13 shown in figure [ fig : gammap_all ] ; the total distributions for equal and unequal dispersions are also plotted in the figure .",
    "the kmm test confirms in both cases that the likelihood that @xmath13 was drawn from a single gaussian rather than a bimodal distribution is @xmath61 in both cases the two gaussians correspond closely to the core and power - law definitions , with the `` valleys '' in the distributions falling in the region containing the intermediate galaxies .",
    "the `` power - law gaussian '' is 95%  complete for @xmath62 while the `` core gaussian '' is 95%  complete for @xmath63    a different test for bimodality is provided by the dip test @xcite , which compares the best - fitting unimodal distribution function to the empirical distribution function .",
    "the dip statistic is the maximum difference between these two distribution functions , which is a measure of the multimodality of the sample .",
    "monte carlo simulations drawn from a unimodal distribution determine the probability of obtaining a measured dip statistic .",
    "the dip test allows for greater generality in the possible forms of the distribution function , and thus is a more conservative statistic for excluding unimodality .",
    "the value of the dip statistic for the full sample is 0.047 , which excludes the unimodal hypothesis at 99.9% significance .",
    "one caveat is that the overall distribution of @xmath13 is biased due to the inclusion of the @xcite bcg sample , which greatly enhances the population of luminous core galaxies .",
    "figures [ fig : gammap_d ] and [ fig : gammap_mag ] plot @xmath13 as a function of distance and luminosity , respectively , allowing some potential biases in the complete sample to be explored .",
    "figure [ fig : gammap_d ] , for example , shows a strong transition in the population of structural types at @xmath64 mpc .",
    "since all but two bgc have @xmath65 mpc , we can easily exclude them from the sample by considering only those galaxies at @xmath66 mpc ; this cut also excludes several other luminous core galaxies .",
    "the smoothed histogram of the distance - cut subsample shown in figure [ fig : gam_hist ] is clearly bimodal , which is is verified by the kmm test ; again the likelihood that the population was drawn from a single gaussian is @xmath61 the valleys between the two modal peaks for both the equal and unequal dispersion cases are not quite as deep ( the distributions are plotted in figure [ fig : gammap_d ] ) , but the location of the two modal peaks for galaxies with @xmath66 mpc are essentially the same as those for the entire sample .",
    "the value of the dip statistic for this subsample is 0.050 , which excludes the unimodal hypothesis at 98.2% significance .",
    "the transition between power - law and core galaxies that occurs with increasing luminosity is evident in figure [ fig : gammap_mag ] ; we show the histograms of the structural types with luminosity in figure [ fig : lum_hist ] .",
    "while the sample has poor completeness at low luminosities , and the high luminosity population is enhanced by inclusion of the bcg sample , there are no obvious biases in the middle part of the distribution .",
    "the figure shows that core and power - law galaxies coexist in roughly equal numbers in the interval @xmath67 with the occurrence of power - law galaxies dropping off rapidly at higher luminosities , and few core galaxies existing below the low end of this interval .",
    "a complete transition in form occurs over a very small luminosity interval .",
    "the distribution of @xmath13 remains bimodal within the luminosity interval of the power - law / core transition , as is evident in figure [ fig : gam_hist ] . even though a majority of the intermediate galaxies fall within this luminosity range , they are still relatively rare .",
    "one can not describe the population of galaxies as being drawn from a simple linear relationship between luminosity and @xmath35 once again the kmm test rejects the single gaussian at the @xmath68 level for representing the distribution of @xmath13 for just the galaxies with @xmath69 again , the modal peaks shown in table [ tab : bimodal ] and figure [ fig : gammap_mag ] closely correspond to the core and power - law definitions .",
    "the value of the dip statistic for this luminosity - cut subsample is 0.053 , which excludes the unimodal hypothesis at 95.5% significance .",
    "the intermediate classification appears to be highly dependent on resolution , as @xcite noted .",
    "indeed , we consider all the galaxies so classified by rest et al .  to be core galaxies , given the finer resolution limits adopted here for their wfpc2 profiles . at the same time , we consider ngc 2902 , 4482 , 5796 , and 5898 , which were classified as power - laws by rest et al . , to be intermediate galaxies .",
    "likewise , we find the intermediate classification in the @xcite sample to vary with choice of resolution limit . in a sense ,",
    "the tests conducted above might lead one to relabel the intermediate galaxies with @xmath70 as `` ambiguous galaxies . ''",
    "the valley in a bimodal distribution is a region where outliers from each mode coexist and classification of any given galaxy can not be done with any degree of reliability .",
    "it is likely that with better resolution some of the present intermediate galaxies would be classified as core galaxies .",
    "ngc 3585 and 4709 , for example , have well - defined breaks , but have @xmath13 of 0.31 and 0.32 , respectively , falling only just above the core boundary ; they would probably fall below it with better resolution .",
    "at the same time , we are left with the real physical question of why intermediate galaxies are rare , and the possibility that in at least some cases their central structure may offer a unique window on the problem of core formation . as rest et al",
    ". noted , many intermediates have small @xmath71 and do not show as strong breaks as the core galaxies , even accounting for the higher @xmath8 values . in the present sample",
    "we have difficulty identifying any galaxy with @xmath72 that shows a sharp break and well - defined inner cusp  the best candidates for this appear to be ngc 2902 , 5796 , and 5898 . to explore the utility of the intermediate classification",
    "we choose to preserve the 13 intermediate galaxies in the sample as a separate class .",
    "this appears to be sensible based on the central parameter relationships presented in @xcite ; the intermediate galaxies do not appear to fall on the relationships defined by core galaxies .",
    "parametric models provide a means to represent data in a simple way that allows one to determine underlying physical relationships .",
    "however , care has be taken so that unknown biases in the parameterization do not affect the overall results .",
    "this concern is especially important when studying the luminosity density .",
    "since it is calculated by deprojecting the surface brightness profile , any biases in the brightness profile model will be amplified .",
    "luminosity density is more fundamental than surface brightness , thus it is important to verify that the bimodality of cusp slopes in projection truly reflects the intrinsic distribution of space - density slopes .",
    "we therefore bolster the result in the previous section with a non - parametric approach .    the uncertainties for non - parametric models will generally be larger than those resulting from parameter fits , and should provide a more realistic estimate .",
    "the comparison between the two approaches was done in @xcite , where we found that the nuker law provides an accurate estimate of the surface brightness profile in the central regions of early - type galaxies . while detailed analysis of the luminosity density , including dynamical studies , should incorporate a non - parametric approach , use of the nuker law facilitates comparison with theoretical models and parameter correlation studies .",
    "therefore , both are appropriate .",
    "we follow the same procedures as in @xcite to estimate the surface brightness and luminosity density profiles .",
    "the technique represents the measured brightness profiles with smoothing splines , and then inverts the splines into density space .",
    "monte carlo simulations are used to establish the errors in the final density profiles . as the present analysis is identical to that of @xcite",
    ", we refer the reader to that paper for a complete description .",
    "figure [ fig : den_pro ] shows the luminosity density profiles normalized in both radius and luminosity density of all galaxies for which we had the measured isophotal parameters ( the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite samples ) .",
    "the normalization is at the radius that shows the largest logarithmic second derivative in the surface brightness profile ; this point corresponds to the break radius in a nuker law fit , but again it is determined in this context non - parametrically .",
    "this plot is analogous to figure 3 in @xcite ; however , the @xcite sample only contained 42 galaxies , whereas the present plot is based on 85 galaxies .",
    "the two main points evident from both plots are that nearly all galaxies show a central cusp in the luminosity density and that galaxies separate into two types : strong and weak cusp ( i.e. , power - law and core galaxies ) .",
    "again , figure [ fig : den_pro ] shows only a subset of the composite sample constructed in this paper , comprising the profiles of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for which we have the directly measured wfpc1 or wfpc2 surface photometry .",
    "we have excluded the bcgs from @xcite , but their inclusion mainly adds core galaxies .",
    "the sample in figure [ fig : den_pro ] contains more galaxies in the transition region between the core and power - law types than did the sample in @xcite , but the statistical difference between the two profile classifications remains as strong .",
    "we have checked whether dust has an effect by excluding galaxies with central dust strengths greater than 1.0 @xcite .",
    "the resulting composite plot ( the lower panel in figure [ fig : den_pro ] ) shows even cleaner bimodality in the luminosity density compilation .",
    "we have measured the value of the density logarithmic slope at various radii to determine the significance of the bimodality .",
    "we plot histograms and density estimates of the slopes of luminosity density measured at various radii in figure [ fig : den_hist ] . for these plots",
    ", we now include all 166 galaxies for which we have measured profiles .",
    "overplotted on the histograms are adaptive kernel density estimates and their 68%  confidence bands @xcite .",
    "as one goes to larger radii to measure the slope , the significance of the two peaks lessens , and beyond @xmath73 we find a unimodal distribution of slopes .",
    "there are many statistical tests to determine the significance of bimodality , and most give very similar results . using the dip test for the four radial limits presented ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 )",
    ", we find significance values of 0.997 , 0.98 , 0.80 , and 0.40 . the hypothesis that the central slopes are unimodal at the _ hst _ resolution limit",
    "is highly excluded , with significance very similar to what we find from the nuker fits using the kmm algorithm .",
    "the analysis in the previous sections conflicts strongly with the @xcite conclusion that a bimodal cusp distribution is `` untenable . ''",
    "@xcite derived surface photometry profiles of 100 early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster as part of their acs virgo cluster survey .",
    "their methodology differs from ours in a variety of ways .",
    "they used the acs / wfc , observed in the sdss _",
    "g _ and _ z _ filters , and measured surface photometry as a function of isophote geometric mean radius ; however , all of these differences are trivial .",
    "a more significant difference is that the @xcite sample extends to much fainter systems than we have studied , while we have much richer coverage of bright ( @xmath4 ) systems where the core / power - law transition occurs .",
    "the relationship of the central structure of the faint dwarf elliptical galaxies studied in the vcs to that of brighter ellipticals is an important question , but as we discuss later , it is also one that can be cleanly separated from the physical interpretation of bimodality that we have advanced in @xcite , namely that at @xmath76 the central structure of elliptical galaxies makes a rapid transition in form with increasing luminosity , which is well correlated to other physical properties of the systems .",
    "the vcs analysis also finds that core galaxies appear above this luminosity , but their physical picture of less luminous galaxies is markedly different than ours .",
    "the divergence between us and @xcite appears to be mainly due to differences in our respective models used to describe the inner surface brightness profiles of ellipticals .",
    "we fit nuker laws directly to profiles measured from psf - deconvolved images .",
    "@xcite use three different forms , but in all cases are fitting psf - convolved models to the images as observed .",
    "one model uses the @xcite form alone , @xmath77,\\ ] ] while a second includes an additional king - model nucleus added to this form . for their core galaxies , @xcite use core - s ' ersic  models @xcite , but with @xmath78 , which mean the galaxies are actually fitted with two different forms that intersect at the break radius , @xmath79,\\qquad r > r_b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while there are _ a priori _ reasons for why one might prefer one approach to the other , the only real issue is which approach has better fidelity to the data .",
    "a direct comparison of the vcs models and nuker law fits to deconvolved brightness profiles shows that the nuker models are superior representations of the observations .",
    "further , the differences between these models and our data are always echoed in the model residuals presented by @xcite for their own data ( except where the vcs model includes a large nuclear component , which absorbs the residuals ) .",
    "we conclude that our different results for the same galaxies are not due to differences in the basic image data , nor even the use of deconvolution versus psf - convolved model fitting ( although recognizing subtle systematic failures of the models is considerably more difficult in the observed domain ) , but in the accuracy and appropriateness of the different profile parameterizations used .",
    "the present sample has 27 galaxies in common with the 100 vcs galaxies .",
    "as these are preferentially brighter systems , the overlap between the two samples in the luminosity range associated with the transition between core and power - law galaxies is much more significant ; the great majority of the common systems are brighter than the median vcs galaxy luminosity . of the 27 galaxies , 22",
    "were observed by us in the course of our own _",
    "_ observational programs .",
    "the majority of these were imaged with wfpc2 , but a substantial minority were obtained with wfpc1 . as discussed in @xcite , deconvolved profiles obtained with both cameras agree extremely well for @xmath80 we show below that both cameras also agree as well with deconvolved acs / wfc observations . differing resolution between the three cameras is not a factor that contributes to the differences between the present and vcs results .",
    "figure [ fig : gam_diff ] plots @xmath13 values from the present sample against those of the vcs sample for the 27 galaxies in common .",
    "the agreement between the samples is poor , but there are clear trends in the pattern of the differences .",
    "the vcs @xmath13 values for the core galaxies are always systematically higher than our values , while the vcs @xmath13 values for the power - law galaxies are uniformly lower . the dynamic range of the vcs @xmath13 values is thus overall smaller than ours , and many of the vcs @xmath13 values place the galaxies in the intermediate zone between cores and power - laws . in a number of cases , often where @xcite claimed the existence of large nuclei , the agreement between the two samples is especially poor , with the vcs @xmath13 values falling in the range of core galaxies for systems that we had classified as power - laws .",
    "the acs / wfc imagery used by the vcs study and the wfpc2 and wfpc1 imagery that dominate the present sample provide essentially equivalent information .",
    "a comparison of wfpc2/pc1 and acs / wfc psfs shows that wfpc2 actually provides significantly better angular resolution ( figure [ fig : psf ] ) .",
    "the fwhm of the wfpc2/pc1 f555w is @xmath81 while that of the acs / wfc f475w psf is @xmath82 or 50%  larger .",
    "the use of _ drizzle _ @xcite to rectify the acs images slightly degrades its resolution further .",
    "the present sample has 49 galaxies at virgo distance or closer , and a substantial number that are no more than 50%  more distant ; both the present and vcs samples are probing the same physical scales in the galaxies .",
    "regardless of the resolution difference between wfpc2 and acs , psf - deconvolution provides a model - independent approach to correct _ hst _ imagery for the `` wings '' of the psf outside the _ hst _ diffraction limit and to isolate the profile analysis from the residual blurring interior to the diffraction limit that remains even after deconvolution .",
    "the deconvolution tests presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have established that this methodology works well for _ hst _ studies of brightness profiles ; they also yield well - understood resolution limits .",
    "the acs images can be deconvolved as well to correct for differences between the acs and wfpc2 psfs outside the resolution limit .",
    "we demonstrate this with direct comparisons of deconvolved acs and wfpc2 or wfpc1 profiles for several galaxies in common .",
    "figure [ fig : acsdecon ] compares profiles measured from psf - deconvolved acs f475w  drizzled \" images to those obtained from deconvolved wfpc1 f555w images @xcite for eight galaxies in common , and from deconvolved wfpc2 f555w images @xcite for two galaxies in common .",
    "we present more extensive comparisons between acs and wfpc1 than between acs and wfpc2 because this is the more challenging test ; the wfpc1 imagery was blurred by a strongly aberrated psf .",
    "further , most of the power - law galaxies in common with the vcs sample were observed with wfpc1 rather than wfpc2 ; the steep central cusps in power - laws present a greater challenge for deconvolution than do core galaxies .",
    "the agreement between all three cameras in all cases is excellent , with differences between the profiles for @xmath83 limited to only a few percent .",
    "this is consistent with the expectations from the simulations and tests quoted above , which show that wfpc1 deconvolutions are largely accurate into @xmath84 ( with the caveat noted in @xcite that wfpc1 deconvolutions may be less accurate at this radius if a strong nuclear point source is present ) .",
    "acs / wfc has superior resolution for @xmath85 as evidenced by the systematically higher central surface brightnesses recovered interior to this radius .",
    "since figure [ fig : acsdecon ] shows nearly all of the 10 wfpc1 overlap galaxies , it demonstrates directly that the use of wfpc1 profiles in the present sample is not a factor in the strongly different @xmath13 values derived from the nuker and vcs models .",
    "the two galaxies selected for the wfpc2/acs comparisons are the most centrally compact galaxies observed with wfpc2 in the overlap sample , and thus are the most sensitive to differences in resolution .",
    "the wfpc2 profiles show superior resolution to acs / wfc for @xmath85 which is expected , given the sharper wfpc2 psf . again , however , none of the differences between the vcs results and ours depends on the exquisite treatment of details near the _ hst _ diffraction limit , as we will show in the next section .",
    "the vcs and present @xmath13 values both come from models of the galaxy intrinsic light distributions .",
    "understanding the differences between the @xmath13 values shown in figure [ fig : gam_diff ] requires comparing the vcs and nuker intrinsic models to the deconvolved surface brightness profiles , which are themselves a non - parametric representation of the intrinsic light distributions of the galaxies .",
    "the concordance between acs and wfpc2 or wfpc1 deconvolved profiles further means that we can directly compare the vcs intrinsic profile models ( the adopted representation of the profiles _ prior _ to psf convolution ) to the deconvolved wfpc2 or wfpc1 profiles , as well as comparing the nuker models to deconvolved acs / wfc profiles . in practice",
    ", we can select the camera that provides the highest spatial resolution for a given galaxy , thus comparing both the nuker and vcs models to the best deconvolved profile of the galaxy .",
    "in general , this means using wfpc2 profiles as the first choice , with the acs as the second choice ( wfpc1 profiles will still be used for the two exceptions noted above ) .    the disagreement of @xmath13 values shown in figure [ fig : gam_diff ] can be traced to differences between the vcs and nuker profile models .",
    "we show this on a galaxy by galaxy basis in figures [ fig : acscomp1 ] to [ fig : acscomp3 ] by comparing the published _",
    "intrinsic _ vcs _ g_-band models and nuker models to wfpc2 , acs , and wfpc1 deconvolved isophotal brightnesses .",
    "the measured brightness values are presented twice .",
    "the lower trace has the isophotal scale converted to mean radii to accommodate the vcs models , which are normalized to the surface brightness measures at @xmath86 to account for the color offset between the wfpc1/2 f555w and acs f475w filters .",
    "the upper traces are the same data offset by 0.5 mag and fitted with the nuker models using our preferred semi - major axis radial scale ( these plots were shown earlier in either @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "note that the nuker laws often are not fitted all the way into @xmath87 the limits shown are those we have adopted to avoid central nuclei , and so on , and when larger than the general resolution limits presented in @xmath88 are always the scale at which we measured @xmath35 because we are working in the deconvolved domain , we can exclude the points interior to some radial limit from the fit .",
    "in contrast , models fitted to psf - convolved images must always account for the flux at @xmath89 given its contribution to larger radii in the observed domain .",
    "we thus show the vcs models into the smallest radii for which isophotal parameters have been measured .",
    "we do not present any quantitative measure of how well the nuker versus vcs models fit the data  simple examination of figures [ fig : acscomp1 ] to [ fig : acscomp3 ] shows that the nuker fits provide a better representation of the data in all 22 galaxies .",
    "the differences between the nuker and vcs models can be better understood by grouping the galaxies into three sets : galaxies classified having core type profiles in this paper , galaxies classified as power - law profiles in this paper for which @xcite did not include a nuclear component , and power - laws for which they did include a nucleus .",
    "@xcite described the profiles of the most luminous core galaxies ( ngc 4365 , 4382 , 4406 , 4472 , 4486 , 4552 , and 4649 ) with the @xcite core - s ' ersic  model , which features a power - law cusp at small radii transitioning to a s ' ersic  model at large radii .",
    "as with the nuker law , the radial extent or smoothness of the transition is moderated by the @xmath51 parameter .",
    "@xcite , however set @xmath90 causing a sharp unphysical slope discontinuity the break radius , @xmath50 which sets the radius of transition between the inner cusp and outer s ' ersic  law .",
    "parameter in the core - s ' ersic  law serves an analogous role to the nuker break radius , @xmath50 they are not mathematically equivalent and can not be compared directly .",
    "the nuker @xmath58 occurs at the point of maximum profile curvature ( in log - log coordinates ) , while for the core - s ' ersic  form this point is an exceedingly complex expression involving all parameters except the photometric scale . ]",
    "setting @xmath78 also forces a cusp of constant logarithmic slope to be fitted for all @xmath91    as is clear in figure [ fig : acscomp1 ] , the inner profiles of the core galaxies curve downward as they make a smooth transition from the shallow central cusps to the steeper envelopes .",
    "this transition is well described by the nuker law ; indeed @xcite emphasized the need for allowing @xmath51 to be a free parameter .",
    "force - fitting a cusp with constant logarithmic slope for @xmath92 yields a @xmath13 value that represents the average slope interior to @xmath11 as the slope typically continues to decrease as @xmath16 the true @xmath13 at the resolution limit ( or terminus of the nuker - law fit ) will be systematically smaller , explaining the systematic effect seen in figure [ fig : gam_diff ] .",
    "the departures of the vcs models from the wfpc2 data appear to be completely consistent their residuals from the original acs / wfc data as well .",
    "the patterns produced by assuming the inner cusp to have constant slope are readily evident in the residual traces presented in figure 103 of @xcite .",
    "because that figure only presents residuals in the observed domain , the systematic trends are more subtle than those evident in figure [ fig : acscomp1 ] ; however , one always sees a sharp bump at @xmath93 with a nonzero residual slope at smaller radii .    in the cases of ngc 4473 , 4478 , and 4486b , @xcite fitted s ' ersic  models to galaxies that we classified as core systems .",
    "ngc 4473 is well described by a nuker law with a small @xmath51 parameter .",
    "the s ' ersic  model in contrast clearly over estimates the central @xmath94 again the pattern of residuals that we see here is obvious in vcs figure 103 as well .",
    "this is also true for ngc 4486b .",
    "the extremely large residuals from the s ' ersic  fit for ngc 4478 seen in figure [ fig : acscomp1 ] are again echoed in vcs figure 103 . while we concluded that ngc 4478 has a small nucleus @xcite ,",
    "no such component was included in the vcs model fits .",
    "lastly , one low - luminosity core galaxy , ngc 4458 , was fitted with a highly luminous and spatially extended nucleus by @xcite ; it will be discussed in the context of other galaxies with large assumed vcs nuclei below .",
    "we conclude that none of the present core galaxies observed in the vcs are well matched by the vcs models as the resolution limit is approached .",
    "the vcs choice of a cusp with a constant inner slope or fitting a s ' ersic  model to galaxies with small cores always results in higher @xmath13 values than result from the nuker parameters .",
    "ngc 4434 , 4464 , 4621 , and 4660 are galaxies that we have classified as power - laws that @xcite fitted with pure s ' ersic  laws .",
    "the vcs models for all four galaxies fall below the data as @xmath6 ( figure [ fig : acscomp2 ] ) .",
    "again , this behavior is echoed in vcs figure 103 , which shows that the s ' ersic  fits fall below the _ observed domain _",
    "acs vcs data for @xmath95 in ngc 4464 , 4621 , and 4660 , and @xmath96 in ngc 4434 .",
    "@xcite note that the acs f475w images of both ngc 4621 and 4660 are actually centrally saturated .",
    "this is problematic as information about the central structure is lost once saturation occurs , but it still must be accounted for in the profile models , given that light from the center is also conveyed to larger radii by the psf .",
    "in contrast the nuker models nicely match all four galaxies , in the case of ngc 4464 it is especially notable that the nuker profile , which was derived from wfpc1 imagery , has better fidelity to the acs profile than the vcs model derived directly from the same data .",
    "the plot of nuker @xmath13 versus vcs @xmath13 in figure [ fig : gam_diff ] contains two more power - law galaxies , ngc 4417 and 4564 , for which we do not have our own wfpc2 or wfpc1 profiles , but again the residuals in vcs figure 103 show that their s ' ersic  models fall well below the acs data as @xmath53 this appears to be a generic feature of nearly all the vcs galaxies modelled as non - nucleated s ' ersic  profiles , looking at the vcs galaxies for which we do not have our own data .",
    "ngc 4483 , 4528 , and 4570 are additional examples of where the departure of the vcs s ' ersic  models below their own data is especially large as the _ hst _ resolution limit is approached .    in summary ,",
    "none of the present power - law galaxies are well matched by the vcs pure s ' ersic  models as the resolution limit is approached .",
    "the s ' ersic  models always fall below the data at the center , resulting in smaller @xmath13 values than are inferred from the nuker parameters .",
    "the set of galaxies in figure [ fig : acscomp3 ] , ngc 4387 , 4467 , 4551 , vcc 1199 , 1440 , 1545 , and 1627 , are power - law galaxies to which @xcite fitted s ' ersic  laws plus luminous extended nuclear components .",
    "deconvolved acs images provide all the profiles for this set of comparisons .",
    "@xcite identified nuclei in all these galaxies as well ( with the exception of ngc 4467 ) , albeit ones of markedly lower luminosity and extent than those presented by @xcite .",
    "it is evident from examining the profile fits in figure [ fig : acscomp2 ] that the nuker laws can accurately describe the deconvolved acs profiles of these galaxies into small radii , even though all the nuker models in this subsection were derived from wfpc1 imagery .",
    "the vcs s ' ersic  @xmath97 nucleus models _ in toto _ are also excellent models of the data and thus are physically plausible representations , but the total quality of the fit is not relevant to the accuracy of @xmath35 the vcs s ' ersic  components _ alone _ , from which @xmath13 is measured , always fall below the data well before the resolution limit is reached ( figure [ fig : acscomp3 ] ) .",
    "the implied nuclei often greatly dominate the inner regions where _ hst _ provides unique resolution , the vcs @xmath13 values for such systems are thus inward extrapolations evaluated at radii that in some cases are over an order of magnitude smaller than radii at which the s ' ersic  profile actually dominates .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath13 values from the nuker laws always reflect the end point of the radial interval over which the fit was performed .",
    "we see no reason why an extrapolated @xmath13 measurement from a s ' ersic  law fitted to the envelope should be used in preference to the local @xmath13 at the resolution limit provided by the nuker law .",
    "@xcite point out that definition of what constitutes a nucleus can depend on what the underlying assumed profile is .",
    "a corollary of this , however , is that nuclei so identified will not be unique .",
    "the prior existence of the nuker fits , which also assume small nuclei for nearly all for the galaxies listed above , establishes this .",
    "it is worth noting that s ' ersic  models had not been tested for use to describe the inner portions of _ hst _ brightness profiles prior to the vcs work for more than a few galaxies .",
    "the vcs work , however , takes it as an _ a priori _ assumption rather than as a hypothesis that the envelopes of galaxies , which is where the s ' ersic  laws are fitted , can be used to deduce the structure of the central profile at small radii . under this picture ,",
    "excursions of the data above the s ' ersic  model are declared to be separate nuclear components , rather than as a simple failure of the model .",
    "the vcs nuclei effectively absorb the central flux left over from the s ' ersic  fits ; the residual traces in vcs figure 103 for such galaxies are nearly flat . as figure",
    "[ fig : acscomp3 ] demonstrates , forcing a s ' ersic  fit to galaxies that truly have slowly decreasing power - law profiles will clearly create ersatz nuclei .",
    "again , we see no physical or even empirical justification to prefer the s ' ersic  @xmath97 nucleus model , let alone any demonstration strong enough to show that the nuker law - based interpretation is untenable .",
    "the nuker law , of course , has no physical justification either , however , we are not using it to extrapolate beyond the domain of the fit ; it serves in this context as a smooth representation of the data .",
    "likewise , the use of s ' ersic  models is interesting for the portions of the envelope for which they are adequate fits .",
    "neither should be used to extrapolate to radii considerably smaller than those that are well fitted by their forms  this is why we emphasize the use of @xmath45 which is always a local measure , in preference to @xmath98 which itself is the slope only realized as @xmath53    in this context it is interesting to revisit the non - parametrically derived space density profiles in figure [ fig : den_pro ] .",
    "the strong impression of bimodality in this figure is concordant with the parametric analysis based on the limiting projected profile slopes provided by the nuker law . under the vcs interpretation , however , the clean separation of the two bundles of profiles in the figure would be interpreted as due to nuclear components in the upper bundle , and the composite plot of `` true '' galaxy density profiles could only be constructed with reference to the vcs parametric models .    in our analysis of wfpc1 data",
    "@xcite or wfpc2 data @xcite , we identified nuclei by looking for upturns above a power - law cusp as @xmath53 these are often obvious in core galaxies , as can be seen in some of the examples in figure [ fig : acscomp1 ] , but for power - law galaxies the evidence for a possible nucleus is often just a subtle increase in the profile slope as the resolution limit is approached .",
    "there are no strong _ upward _ breaks in any of the galaxies discussed in this section that would make detection of a nucleus unambiguous . at the same time , @xcite present deconvolved wfpc2 observations of ngc 4474 and 4482 , two galaxies that are plotted in figure [ fig : gam_diff ] with widely differing @xmath13 values , that do have clearly defined nuclei , but again ones more modest than those implied by the vcs models .",
    "we explore the non - uniqueness of the s ' ersic  @xmath97 nucleus model in further detail for ngc 4458 , in which we plot the @xcite data for this galaxy extended to large radii by the addition of the @xmath99 band data of @xcite ( figure [ fig : n4458 ] ) .",
    "the nuker law is fitted to @xmath100 or 2.8 decades in radius , a portion of the galaxy that @xcite consider to be a bright and extended nucleus .",
    "the @xcite s ' ersic  fit in contrast is valid over only @xmath101 a little more than a single decade in radius , but is then extrapolated inwards by 1.6 decades to the radius at which @xcite report @xmath35    the profile of this object is obviously complex and the nuker residuals shown in @xcite show a sinusoidal pattern , associated with an increase in profile slope at @xmath102 perhaps by our criterion , this could be interpreted to be the onset of a nucleus .",
    "even so , the nuker law fitted to just @xmath103 would clearly model this region with less curvature than implied by the s ' ersic  model , again giving a less luminous nucleus .",
    "yet another interpretation , however , is that ngc 4458 is a dwarf s0 galaxy , in which the nuker law appropriately describes the bulge while the s ' ersic  law correctly captures the disk .",
    "the case of ngc 4458 emphasizes that the use of s ' ersic  models plus large nuclei is neither unique nor compelling in galaxies of the luminosities that we are considering .",
    "the distribution of surface brightness cusp slopes as the _ hst _ resolution limit is approached is strongly bimodal .",
    "this confirms once again the usefulness of classification of galaxies into core or power - law systems based on their central brightness profiles .",
    "bimodality is still evident for galaxies within 50 mpc , or for those restricted in luminosity to @xmath104 this last result is of particular interest as it is the interval over which the typical central structure of early - type galaxies changes in form .",
    "very few core galaxies have @xmath105 while only a small number of power - law galaxies have @xmath106 there are a few galaxies that have profiles with @xmath18 thus placing them in an intermediate position between core and power - law systems . intriguingly , these galaxies are most common in the luminosity range over which the core / power - law transition occurs .",
    "intermediate galaxies are rare , however , and they do not fill in the `` valley '' in the distribution of cusp slopes .    as a check on our conclusions that the distribution of cusp slopes is bimodal , we repeated the non - parametric analysis of the _ hst _ brightness profiles presented by @xcite .",
    "this provides a strong demonstration of bimodality in the space _ density _ profiles without reference to any fitting function or any physical assumption beyond adopting the radius of maximum curvature of the profiles as a common physical scale .",
    "the concordance of this very simple approach with the results from the nuker law fits , shows that inferences of bimodality from nuker law fits alone are not due to artifacts in or poor behavior of its parametric form ,    these conclusions are inconsistent with the results of @xcite , who presented a strongly different distribution of @xmath13 values based on their vcs galaxies . by examining galaxies in common with the vcs sample",
    ", we find that profiles derived from acs / wfc , wfpc2 , and wfpc1 agree extremely well to their stated resolution limits .",
    "in contrast , we find that the vcs profile models , which the vcs uses to characterize cusp slopes , are either poor representations of the data as the _ hst _ resolution limit is approached , or consist of inward extrapolations of forms fitted to the envelope .",
    "while the latter case , which requires the assumption of large nuclear clusters , may be a plausible model , it is neither unique nor compelling enough to demonstrate that the previous modeling of profiles conducted by our group and others is `` untenable . ''",
    "we do note our large composite sample is largely limited to galaxies with @xmath19 the core / power - law transition occurs at still larger luminosities , and our conclusions on bimodality are limited to this context .",
    "this luminosity limit corresponds to roughly the median vcs galaxy luminosity , however , and many of the faintest vcs galaxies have profiles that are nearly flat at the center .",
    "@xcite are concerned that under our criteria such systems would be classified as cores , something that we have not actually done .",
    "the envelope profiles of these galaxies are nearly exponential and have no well - defined breaks as the center is approached is reached only in the limit @xmath107 for a pure exponential profile . ] .",
    "their overall forms are completely different from the luminous core galaxies and thus they are trivially distinguished from them .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that ellipticals and spheroidals form well defined , disjoint sequences in parameter space . a recent analysis of the profiles of low - luminosity ellipticals and a comparison to a large sample of sph galaxies strongly confirms the e / sph dichotomy @xcite .",
    "the resolution of this question , however , is not relevant to the strong physical dichotomy between power - law and core galaxies advanced in @xcite .",
