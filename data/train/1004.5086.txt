    "one of the central ideas of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle which was first proposed by heisenberg  @xcite for two conjugate observables .",
    "indeed , it forms one of the most significant examples showing that quantum mechanics does differ fundamentally from the classical world .",
    "uncertainty relations today are probably best known in the form given by robertson  @xcite , who extended heisenberg s result to two arbitrary observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "robertson s relation states that if we prepare many copies of the state @xmath5 , and measure each copy individually using either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , we have @xmath6{|\\psi\\rangle}|\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 for @xmath8 is the standard deviation resulting from measuring @xmath5 with observable @xmath9 .",
    "the essence of   is that quantum mechanics does not allow us to simultaneously specify definite outcomes for two non - commuting observables when measuring the same state .",
    "the largest possible lower bound in robertson s inequality ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) is @xmath10 , which happens if and only if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related by a fourier transform , that is , they are conjugate observables .      a natural measure that captures the relations among the probability distributions over the outcomes for each observable is the entropy of such distributions .",
    "this prompted hirschmann to propose the first entropic uncertainty relation for position and momentum observables  @xcite .",
    "this relation was later improved by  @xcite , where  @xcite show that heisenberg s uncertainty relation   is in fact implied by this entropic uncertainty relation .",
    "hence , using entropic quantities provides us with a much more general way of quantifying uncertainty .",
    "indeed , it was realized by deutsch  @xcite that other means of quantifying `` uncertainty '' are also desirable for another reason : note that the lower bound in   is trivial when @xmath5 happens to give zero expectation on @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "hence , it would be useful to have a way of measuring `` incompatibility '' which depends only on the measurements @xmath3 and @xmath4 and not on the state .",
    "deutsch  @xcite himself showed that @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the min - entropy arising from measuring the pure state @xmath5 using the basis @xmath14 ( see section  [ sec : urquantities ] for more information on the entropic quantities we use ) . if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related by a fourier transform , then the r.h.s .",
    "of   becomes @xmath23 , where the minimum is achieved by a state that is invariant under the fourier transform .",
    "since the shannon entropy obeys @xmath24 , deutsch s bound also holds for the shannon entropy .",
    "better lower bounds have since been obtained for the shannon entropy by maassen and uffink  @xcite following a conjecture of kraus  @xcite .",
    "their uncertainty relations are again strongest ( in the sense that the lower bound is largest ) when the bases @xmath14 and @xmath15 are conjugate , that is , the two bases are related by a fourier transform . apart from their role in understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics , these uncertainty relations play a central role in cryptography in the noisy - storage model  @xcite , quantum key distribution  @xcite , information locking  @xcite , and the question of separability  @xcite .",
    "in particular , such relations have practical interest in noisy - storage cryptography  @xcite where they may enable us to prove security for a larger class quantum memories .    here , we are concerned with measurements in multiple bases @xmath25 .",
    "entropic uncertainty relations provide a natural way of quantifying `` incompatibility '' of more than two measurements by lower bounding @xmath26 for all states @xmath5 .",
    "we call a state @xmath5 that minimizes the average sum of entropies a _ maximally certain state_. when @xmath27 is the shannon entropy , the largest bound we can hope to obtain for any choice of bases is @xmath28 since choosing @xmath5 to be an element of one of the bases yields zero entropy when we subsequently measure in the same basis .",
    "if   is indeed a lower bound to  , we will call the measurements _ maximally incompatible with respect to the shannon entropy_. note that this can only happen if @xmath5 gives us full entropy   can never exceed @xmath29 , where the maximum is attained when the distribution over the outcomes is uniform @xmath30 . ] when measured in any other basis , that is , the bases are all mutually unbiased .    curiously , however , it was shown that whereas being mutually unbiased is necessary , it is not a sufficient condition to obtain maximally strong uncertainty relations for the shannon entropy  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there do exist large sets of up to @xmath31 mutually unbiased bases in square dimensions for which we do obtain very weak uncertainty relations  @xcite .",
    "recently , ambainis  @xcite has shown that for any three bases from the `` standard '' mutually unbiased bases construction  @xcite in prime dimension , the lower bound can not exceed @xmath32 , for large dimensions . for dimensions of the form @xmath33 and @xmath34 no further assumption is needed , but the proof assumes the generalized riemann hypothesis for dimensions of the form @xmath35 . furthermore ,",
    "for any @xmath36 , there always exist @xmath37 of these bases such that the lower bound can not be larger than @xmath38 .",
    "only if we use the maximal set of @xmath39 mutually unbiased bases that can be found for any given prime power dimension , do we obtain quite strong uncertainty relations  @xcite .    at present",
    ", we merely know that there do exist arbitrarily large sets of two outcome measurements that give us maximally strong uncertainty relations  @xcite , and that in larger dimensions selecting a large amount of bases at random does provide us with strong relations  @xcite ( for a survey see  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it remains an intriguing open question as to whether there even exist three measurements with three outcomes in dimension @xmath40 that are maximally incompatible with respect to the shannon entropy .      in the light of these questions , it is therefore natural to study the structure of mutually unbiased bases(mubs ) to see whether we can identify additional properties which are sufficient for obtaining strong uncertainty relations . in  @xcite",
    ", wootters and sussman made the interesting observation that for the maximal set of @xmath39 mutually unbiased bases coming from such constructions as  @xcite in dimension @xmath1 , the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation in terms of the collision entropy given in  @xcite is tight , and the minimum is attained by a state that is invariant under a unitary that cyclically permutes the set of all @xmath39 mubs .",
    "a similar unitary was noted to exist by chau  @xcite .",
    "wootters and sussman derive their transformation from phase space arguments . their unitary can in fact easily be generalized to cyclically permute @xmath41 bases , whenever @xmath41 divides @xmath39 ( see section  [ sec : urdwggeneral ] ) .",
    "the results in  @xcite have recently been generalized by appleby  @xcite , who shows that in prime power dimensions of the form @xmath42 , there exists a unitary operation that cyclically permutes the first and second halves of the full set of mubs .",
    "this raises the pressing question of whether smaller sets of mubs also exhibit such symmetries ? and can we exploit such symmetries to obtain tight uncertainty relations ?",
    "in particular , is the minimizing state always an invariant of such a transformation as observed for two bases in  ?",
    "* main result * we first show by an explicit construction that there exist sets of @xmath43 mutually unbiased bases in dimension @xmath1 with the property that there exists a unitary that cyclically permutes all bases in this set , whenever ( a ) @xmath41 is prime , and ( b ) @xmath41 divides @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "more specifically , we provide an explicit construction of mubs @xmath25 with @xmath46 and a unitary @xmath47 such that @xmath48 furthermore , in dimension @xmath2 , we actually find such a unitary for any set of @xmath41 mubs , where @xmath49 .",
    "our approach exploits properties of the clifford algebra , which might yield new insights into the structure of these mubs .",
    "it is entirely distinct from the phase space approach which was used to construct such a unitary for the full set of @xmath39 mubs  @xcite .",
    "note that our construction gives at most @xmath50 bases , but shows that there is indeed an additional symmetry which has previously gone unnoticed . for @xmath51 bases",
    ", @xmath47 is simply the fourier transform , and it would be interesting to investigate general properties of our transformation and whether it has applications in other areas .",
    "we then apply our transformation to the study of uncertainty relations in terms of the _ min - entropy _ ( see  ) .",
    "since @xmath24 , this also provides us with bounds on uncertainty relations in terms of the shannon entropy .",
    "of course , many forms of entropy could be considered when it comes to quantifying uncertainty , and each has its merits .",
    "the min - entropy is of particular interest in cryptography , and is also related to the well studied extrema of the discrete wigner function as we will discuss in section  [ sec : urdiscretewigner ] .",
    "in particular , it will be easy to see that the average min - entropy for the full set of @xmath52 mubs can be bounded as @xmath53\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the maximum value of the discrete wigner function at the point @xmath55 in discrete phase space .",
    "symmetries thereby play an important role in determining @xmath56 .    *",
    "second result * we prove a simple min - entropic uncertainty relation for an arbitrary set of @xmath41 mutually unbiased bases . for mubs @xmath25 we obtain @xmath57 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the case of @xmath58 mubs in dimension @xmath13 , this bound is indeed the same as the bound in  . for any small set of @xmath59 mubs , our bound matches the strongest known bound  @xcite .",
    "we also prove the following alternate lower bound : @xmath60,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is stronger than   for the complete set of @xmath61 mubs in dimension @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , when @xmath62 , the two bounds are equivalent .",
    "we further show that   is in fact tight for @xmath63 mubs in dimension @xmath2 stemming from our construction , where the minimum is attained for an invariant state of the transformation @xmath47 that cyclically permutes all @xmath64 bases . even though this is a somewhat restricted statement",
    ", it is the first time that a tight entropic uncertainty relation has been obtained for this case .",
    "the minimizing state here has an appealing symmetry property , just as for the case of @xmath51 bases in   where the minimum is attained by a state that is invariant under the fourier transform .    for the collision entropy @xmath65",
    ", wootters  @xcite previously showed that the lower bound from  @xcite is attained by an invariant state when considering the full set of @xmath39 mubs . here , however , we exhibit a tight uncertainty relation for these @xmath66 bases in @xmath2 for the collision entropy @xmath65 which has an entirely different structure and the minimum is not attained by an invariant state of our transformation .",
    "nevertheless , we have for the first time a _ tight _ entropic uncertainty relation for _ all _ possible mubs in a dimension larger than the trivial case of @xmath67 where the bloch sphere representation makes the problem easily accessible . in @xmath2",
    ", we have a tight relation for @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and tight relations for @xmath65 for @xmath70 .",
    "our result indicates that due to the different properties of the minimizing state for different numbers of bases , the problem may be even more daunting than previously imagined . yet",
    ", our work shows that in each case the minimizing state is by no means arbitrary .",
    "it has a well defined ( albeit different ) structure in each of the cases .    *",
    "third result * for some sets of mubs we do obtain for the first time , significant insight into the structure of the maximally certain states . in particular , we note in section  [ sec : symmetry ] that for @xmath41 mutually unbiased bases that the state that minimizes the min - entropic uncertainty relations is an invariant of a certain unitary whenever @xmath41 divides @xmath39 for @xmath1 .",
    "before explaining our construction of mutually unbiased bases for which there exists a unitary that cyclically permutes them , let us define the notions of mubs more formally and recall some known facts .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be two orthonormal bases in @xmath73 .",
    "they are said to be _ mutually unbiased _ if @xmath74 , for all @xmath75 .",
    "a set @xmath76 of orthonormal bases in @xmath73 is called a _ set of mutually unbiased bases _ if each pair of bases is mutually unbiased .",
    "for example , the well - known computational and hadamard basis are mutually unbiased .",
    "we use @xmath77 to denote the maximal number of mubs in dimension @xmath13 . in any dimension @xmath13",
    ", we have that @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath79 is a prime power , we have @xmath80 and explicit constructions are known  @xcite .",
    "other constructions are known that give less than @xmath39 mubs in other dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still an open problem whether there exists a set of @xmath81 ( or even @xmath64 ! ) mubs in dimension @xmath82 .",
    "our construction of mutually unbiased bases makes essential use of the techniques developed in  @xcite , together with properties of the clifford algebra .",
    "the clifford algebra is the associative algebra generated by operators @xmath83 satisfying @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it has a unique representation by hermitian matrices on @xmath44 qubits ( up to unitary equivalence ) that can be obtained via the famous jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite : @xmath86 for @xmath87 , where we use @xmath9 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 to denote the pauli matrices .",
    "furthermore , we let @xmath90 note that in dimension @xmath67 these are just the familiar pauli matrices , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    of particular importance to us",
    "will be the fact that we can view the operators @xmath83 , as @xmath94 orthogonal vectors forming a basis for @xmath95 .",
    "in particular , for any orthonormal transformation @xmath96 which when applied to the vector @xmath97 gives @xmath98 , there exists a unitary @xmath99 such that @xmath100 the orthonormal transformation that is particularly interesting to us here is the one that cyclically permutes the basis vectors .",
    "as described above we can find a corresponding unitary @xmath101 which cyclically permutes the basis vectors @xmath102 .",
    "an explicit construction can be found in the appendix .",
    "this symmetry can be extended to @xmath103 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it will also be useful that the set of @xmath104 operators @xmath105 forms an orthogonal basis   for @xmath106 hermitian matrices in @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "to construct mutually unbiased bases , we follow the procedure outlined in  @xcite , but now applied to a subset of the operators in @xmath107 .",
    "that is , we will group operators into classes of commuting operators , i.e. , sets @xmath108 of size @xmath109 such that    1 .",
    "the elements of @xmath110 commute for all @xmath111 , 2 .",
    "@xmath112 for all @xmath113 .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that the common eigenbases of such classes form a set of @xmath41 mubs .",
    "first of all , note that no class can contain two generators @xmath114 and @xmath115 since they do not commute .",
    "when forming the classes we hence ensure that each one contains exactly one generator @xmath114 , which clearly limits us to constructing at most @xmath0 such classes .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining a partitioning that is suitable for our purpose is to ensure that the unitary @xmath47 that cyclically permutes the generators @xmath116 also permutes the corresponding bases by permuting products of operators appropriately .",
    "we show in the appendix that our general construction achieves the following :    suppose that @xmath43 is prime , and either @xmath41 divides @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "then in dimension @xmath117 , there exist @xmath41 mutually unbiased bases @xmath25 for which there exists a unitary @xmath47 that cyclically permutes them @xmath118      let us consider two simple examples of such classes in dimension @xmath2 .",
    "these are not obtained from our general construction , but nevertheless provide us with the necessary intuition . for @xmath66 mubs",
    "the classes are given by @xmath119 it is easy to see that the unitary @xmath47 that achieves the transformation @xmath120 , but leaves @xmath121 and @xmath122 invariant , cyclically permutes the bases given above . for the collision entropy",
    "@xmath65 the minimum is attained for an eigenstate of the _ commuting _",
    "operators @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this minimizing state also shows that the wellknown bound for @xmath65 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) can be _",
    "tight_.    for @xmath63 mubs we obtain the classes @xmath126",
    "it is easy to see that the unitary @xmath47 that achieves the transformation @xmath127 , but leaves @xmath128 invariant , cyclically permutes the bases given above . for @xmath63 classes the minimum in the entropic uncertainty relation for @xmath68",
    "is attained for a state that is invariant under the transformation @xmath47 .",
    "however , we also know that for @xmath63 or @xmath129 classes in dimension @xmath130 no partitioning of operators is possible that satisfies our requirements .",
    "thus , for what values of @xmath41 and @xmath13 such a unitary can be found , remains an interesting open question .",
    "we now investigate the relationship between the observed symmetries and entropic uncertainty relations .      before comparing different uncertainty relations , we first provide a short introduction to all the entropic quantities we will use . the expert reader may safely skip this section . in general , the _ rnyi entropy _",
    "@xcite of order @xmath55 of the distribution obtained by measuring a state @xmath5 in the basis @xmath12 is given by @xmath131.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indeed , the shannon entropy forms a special case of the rnyi entropy by taking the limit @xmath132 , i.e. , @xmath133 , where we omit the subscript .",
    "of particular importance are the _ min - entropy _ , for @xmath134:[def : minentropy ] @xmath135 and the _ collision entropy_[def : collision ] @xmath136 we have @xmath137 and hence uncertainty relations for @xmath138 also provide us with a bound on uncertainty relations for @xmath139 whenever @xmath140 .",
    "note that intuitively , the min - entropy is determined by the highest peak in the distribution and most closely captures the notion of `` guessing '' . to see why it is a more useful quantity in cryptography than the shannon entropy ,",
    "consider the following example distribution @xmath141 : let @xmath142 and let @xmath143 be the all 0 string .",
    "suppose that @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 , i.e. , with probability @xmath147 we choose @xmath148 and with probability @xmath147 we choose one string uniformly at random .",
    "then @xmath149 , whereas @xmath150 !",
    "if @xmath151 would correspond to an encryption key used to encrypt an @xmath44 bit message , we would certainly not talk about security if we can guess the key with probability at least @xmath147 !",
    "yet , the shannon entropy is quite high .",
    "apart from its cryptographic applications , min - entropic uncertainty relations are appealing since the problem of determining tight uncertainty relations can be simplified considerably in the presence of symmetries .",
    "furthermore , these relations bear an interesting relation to the extrema of the discrete wigner function .",
    "first of all , note that for the min - entropy we have by jensen s inequality that @xmath152 where the inequality becomes equality if all terms @xmath153 are the same .",
    "for @xmath154 , define @xmath155 note that determining a tight lower bound to   is thus equivalent to determining @xmath156 clearly , any @xmath157 such that @xmath158 thus gives us a lower bound for  . for any set of bases ,",
    "this makes the problem of finding a bound more approachable as it reduces the problem to finding the largest eigenvalue for any operator @xmath159 .",
    "in particular , it can be phrased as a semidefinite program to minimize @xmath157 such that   holds for all @xmath160 .",
    "it is now easy to see why symmetries simplify our goal of determining tight uncertainty relations .",
    "[ lem : symmetry ] suppose that for every @xmath161 there exists a unitary @xmath162 such that @xmath163 .",
    "then there exists a @xmath164 such that the minimum in   is attained for a state @xmath165 that is invariant under @xmath166 .",
    "first of all , note that @xmath167 and hence for @xmath168 @xmath169 in particular , this holds for the state @xmath170 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath5 with the largest eigenvalue of @xmath171 . when looking for the minimizing state on the r.h.s of   we can thus restrict ourselves to states which are invariant under @xmath172 .",
    "note that in this case , we furthermore have that @xmath173 meaning that the inequality   is tight in case of such a symmetry which is our claim .",
    "the question of course remains , whether such unitaries do exist in general .",

    "clearly , by considering the unitary @xmath174 one can trivially adapt their construction to obtain a unitary that cyclically permutes @xmath41 mubs whenever @xmath175 . by first translating any point in the phase space to the origin , then applying the transformation @xmath174 and finally translating the origin back to the original point",
    ", one can obtain the desired unitaries @xmath162 that enable us to find tight bounds for the min - entropic uncertainty relations .",

    "in particular , when we consider the complete set ( @xmath188 ) of mubs in any dimension @xmath13 , this approach yields the best known bound .",
