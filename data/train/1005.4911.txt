    "the quest for a deeper understanding of polyhedra - like structures and their symmetry in euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath1 has been with us since ancient times and has inspired important developments in geometry and other areas . with the passage of time , various notions of polyhedra have attracted attention and have brought to light new exciting classes of highly - symmetric figures . a key step was the radically new , graph - theoretical , or _ skeletal _ , approach , pioneered by grnbaum  @xcite , which introduced polyhedra as geometric ( edge ) graphs that are equipped with a face structure . in this vein , the notion of a regular polyhedron transcended from its origin , the five platonic solids , to the four kepler - poinsot star - polyhedra , to the three petrie - coxeter polyhedra , finally to the more recently discovered forty - eight grnbaum - dress polyhedra ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "various other classes of polyhedra with weaker symmetry properties have also been investigated and their polyhedra completely classified ( see martini  @xcite , @xcite for surveys focusing on convex polyhedra ) . the skeletal approach has also been extended to higher - dimensional spaces , where remarkable classification results for polyhedra and polytopes have been obtained by mcmullen  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the present article was inspired by the study in wills  @xcite of a class of nearly regular polyhedra in @xmath1 .",
    "a polyhedron @xmath3 is called a _ regular polyhedron of index @xmath2 _ if its underlying abstract polyhedron ( or surface map ) is combinatorially ( reflexibly ) regular and if its geometric symmetry group @xmath4 has index @xmath2 in the combinatorial automorphism group @xmath5 of @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath5 is flag - transitive but @xmath4 has two orbits on the flags .",
    "thus @xmath3 is combinatorially regular but  fails geometric regularity by a factor of @xmath2 \" .",
    "the concept of a regular polyhedron of index @xmath2 was introduced in wills  @xcite for orientable polyhedra with planar faces .",
    "there are exactly five such polyhedra , each with an interesting history , namely polyhedral realizations of the two pairs of dual maps @xmath6 , @xmath7 of genus @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 of genus @xmath11 , and of a self - dual map of type @xmath12 of genus @xmath13 ( see @xcite for the enumeration and richter  @xcite for figures ) . the polyhedra @xmath7 and @xmath10 were discovered by hess ( 1878 ) , pitsch ( 1881 ) and badoureau ( 1881 ) , although the appeal at the time of discovery was more in their overall metrical shape than in the combinatorics of the underlying regular surface maps ( abstract polyhedra ) and their geometric realizations ; for the history see coxeter  @xcite , and for figures see ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.4a ) and coxeter , longuet - higgins & miller  ( * ? ? ?",
    "45 and 53 ) .",
    "the map @xmath7 of genus @xmath8 was apparently first discovered by gordan  @xcite ; under duality and petrie - duality , it gives rise to the other three maps of genus @xmath8 or @xmath11 .",
    "the polyhedra @xmath6 and @xmath9 , respectively , are obtained from the polyhedra @xmath7 and @xmath10 by polarity ( see grnbaum & shephard  @xcite ) ; for figures see ( * ? ? ?",

    "26 , tafel viii ) ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath15 on plate ix ) ) .",
    "the present paper and its successor  @xcite describe a complete classification of the finite regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 in @xmath1 ( see also @xcite ) , with no assumption on planarity of faces or orientability of the underlying abstract polyhedron .",
    "here we establish that up to similarity there are precisely @xmath16 infinite families of regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 with vertices on two orbits under the full symmetry group , where two polyhedra belong to the same family if they differ only in the relative size of the spheres containing their vertex orbits .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 of these are related to ordinary regular polyhedra ( of index @xmath18 ) .",
    "all polyhedra in these @xmath16 families have a face - transitive symmetry group , and are orientable , but only two have planar faces ( and hence occur in @xcite , as @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the complete enumeration of the remaining regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 , with vertices on one orbit , is described in the subsequent paper @xcite by the first author ; there are exactly @xmath21 such polyhedra .",
    "no finite regular polyhedron of index @xmath2 can be chiral ; on the other hand , there are six classes of infinite regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 which are chiral ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ mapo ] and [ combgeo ] ,",
    "respectively , we cover the basics about polyhedra , maps , and combinatorial and geometric regularity .",
    "then in section  [ symgr ] we investigate the symmetry groups . a key step in our approach",
    "is to determine , for all allowable vertex configurations , the possible types of faces that the polyhedron may have . to this end , in sections  [ facstab ] and [ sha ] , we discuss face stabilizers and face shapes .",
    "finally , the enumeration of polyhedra with two vertex orbits is carried out in section  [ twoorbits ] .",
    "geometric realizations of abstract combinatorial complexes have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "one specific approach begins with an abstract object , in the present case an abstract polyhedron or a map on a surface , and then studies ways of realizing its combinatorics in an explicit geometric setting ( for example , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 5 ) and @xcite )",
    ". however , in the present paper we often take a more direct geometric approach and explicitly define the objects as polyhedra - like structures in an ambient space . throughout",
    ", this space will be the euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath1 .",
    "it is then understood that these objects are faithful realizations in @xmath1 , in the sense of ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) , of underlying abstract polyhedra ; that is , they are geometric polyhedra as described below .",
    "an _ abstract polyhedron _ , or an _ abstract polytope _ of rank @xmath0 , is a partially ordered set @xmath22 with a strictly monotone rank function with range @xmath23 . the elements of ranks @xmath24 , @xmath18 , or @xmath2 are called the _ vertices _ , _ edges _ , or _ faces _ of @xmath25 , respectively .",

    "each _ flag _ ( maximal chain ) of @xmath25 contains exactly five elements including @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "we often ignore the least element and largest element and identify @xmath25 with its set of proper elements , so in particular flags are @xmath0-element sets consisting of a vertex , an edge and a face of @xmath3 , all mutually incident .",
    "all abstract polyhedra are maps on closed surfaces in the sense of coxeter & moser  @xcite , and all maps on closed surfaces satisfying the above homogeneity property are abstract polyhedra . throughout",
    "we make the blanket assumption that the polyhedron or map is finite .",
    "then the underlying surface is necessarily compact .    informally , a geometric polyhedron will consist of a family of vertices , edges and finite polygons , all fitting together in a way characteristic for ordinary convex polyhedra or polyhedral complexes .",
    "recall here that a ( finite ) _ polygon _ , or simply _ @xmath44-gon _ , @xmath45 in euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath1 is a figure formed by distinct points @xmath46 , together with the line segments @xmath47 , for @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",

    "7e ) as well as to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    given a face @xmath38 of a geometric polyhedron we sometimes abuse notation and use the term _ boundary _ ( or _ face boundary _ ) of @xmath38 to mean the underlying edge path of @xmath38 , that is , the polygon @xmath38 itself .",
    "if @xmath3 is a polyhedron , we let @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 denote its number of vertices , edges , or faces , respectively . the vector @xmath60 is called the _",

    "an abstract polyhedron @xmath25 is ( _ combinatorially _ ) _ regular _ if its ( _ combinatorial _ ) _ automorphism group _",
    "@xmath61 is transitive on the flags .",
    "the group @xmath61 of a regular polyhedron @xmath25 has a well - behaved system of _ distinguished generators _ obtained as follows .",

    "these generators satisfy ( at least ) the coxeter - type relations @xmath65 with @xmath66 the identity automorphism , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 determine the ( _ schlfli _ ) _ type _ @xmath69 of @xmath25 .",

    "a _ petrie polygon _ of an abstract regular polyhedron @xmath25 ( or a corresponding geometric polyhedron ) is a zigzag polygon along the edges of @xmath25 such that any two , but no three , consecutive edges belong to a common face .",
    "the _ petrie - dual _ of @xmath25 is a regular map with the same vertices and edges as @xmath25 , obtained by replacing the faces of @xmath25 by its petrie polygons .",

    "the iteration of the duality and petrie operations ( taking duals and petrie - duals ) forms a family of six regular maps with the same automorphism group , where possibly some maps are isomorphic .",
    "recall from @xcite that @xmath74 denotes the regular map derived from the regular tessellation @xmath69 on the @xmath2-sphere or the euclidean or hyperbolic plane by identifying any two vertices @xmath75 steps apart along a petrie polygon of @xmath69 .",

    "thus geometric regularity of @xmath3 implies the combinatorial regularity of @xmath25 , or more informally , that of @xmath3 .",
    "the group @xmath4 of a regular geometric polyhedron @xmath3 is transitive , separately , on the vertices , edges , and faces of @xmath3 . in particular",

    "the group @xmath4 generally contains both proper and improper isometries , that is , rotations , and plane reflections or rotatory reflections . by @xmath85",
    "we denote the subgroup of @xmath4 of index at most @xmath2 consisting of the proper isometries .",
    "a geometric polyhedron may have many more combinatorial than geometric symmetries .",
    "if @xmath3 is a geometric polyhedron with underlying abstract polyhedron @xmath25 , we call the index of @xmath4 in @xmath61 the _ index _ of @xmath3 and denote it by @xmath86 . thus @xmath87    a geometric polyhedron @xmath3 is called a _ regular polyhedron of index @xmath2 _ if the underlying abstract polyhedron @xmath25 is combinatorially regular and if @xmath3 itself has index @xmath2 .",
    "notice that combinatorial regularity of the underlying abstract polyhedron is required as part of the definition , so in particular , @xmath3 has a schlfli symbol @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , @xmath88 , as @xmath3 is a faithful realization of @xmath25 ( but see also remark  [ rem ] ) .",
    "it follows from the definition that the symmetry group of a regular polyhedron of index @xmath2 has exactly two orbits on the flags of @xmath3 .",

    "as remarked earlier , the condition on the petrie polygons guarantees that the petrie - dual of the underlying abstract polyhedron @xmath25 of @xmath3 is again an abstract polyhedron , @xmath91 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence when the petrie - duality is carried out on the geometric polyhedron @xmath3 itself , we arrive at a geometric polyhedron @xmath89 , a realization of @xmath91 , with the same vertices and edges as @xmath3 . by definition ,",

    "this is a strong property .",
    "in particular , @xmath101 , so if @xmath67 or @xmath68 is odd , then @xmath102 or @xmath103 , respectively ; in fact , in this case we even have @xmath104 or @xmath105 , respectively , since elements of @xmath4 not in @xmath85 are necessarily reflections or rotatory reflections and hence have even period .",

    "we denote the rotation subgroup of @xmath107 .",
    "we begin with the following theorem that excludes all but the full platonic symmetry groups as candidates for the symmetry groups of regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 .",
    "[ excludegroups ] there is no regular polyhedron of index  @xmath2 whose symmetry group is reducible or coincides with the rotation subgroup of the symmetry group of a platonic solid . in particular , there are no regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 that are planar .",

    "the same is more generally true , as shown in the next lemma .",
    "[ noanti ] no edge of any regular polyhedron @xmath3 of index @xmath2 joins vertices that are collinear with the center , @xmath106 , of @xmath3 .",

    "therefore @xmath3 has one face orbit under @xmath4 , so each face must lie in a plane through @xmath106 .",
    "thus every face of @xmath3 adjacent to @xmath38 must also lie in @xmath42 .",
    "since p is connected , it follows , by repetition of the argument , that @xmath3 must be planar .",
    "this is a contradiction since @xmath3 is finite .",
    "the vertices of each vertex orbit of @xmath3 are inscribed in a sphere centered at @xmath106 , and we may take one sphere , @xmath262 , to be our _ reference sphere_. thus all , or one half of , the vertices of @xmath3 are inscribed in @xmath262 and are the vertices of a platonic solid , a cuboctahedron , or an icosidodecahedron , denoted by @xmath152 .",
    "suppose @xmath263 is an edge of @xmath3 , where @xmath264 and @xmath265 are vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "it is useful to consider the projection of that edge onto @xmath262 .",
    "the projection is the ( shorter ) arc of the great circle , which is the intersection of @xmath262 with the plane spanned by @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath106 .",
    "since no projected edge of @xmath3 can join opposite vertices of @xmath262 , all projected edges are less than half a circumference in length .",
    "note also that the projected image of each vertex of @xmath3 is a vertex of @xmath152 , except when @xmath152 is a tetrahedron and the vertices of the other vertex orbit of @xmath3 lie on a tetrahedron opposed to @xmath152 ( in this case the symmetry group is tetrahedral ) .",
    "since the projection of edges is confined to @xmath262 , the angle between two projected images of adjoining edges of a face takes a value in the range between @xmath24 and @xmath268 .",
    "we use this observation to introduce a notation that describes the shape of faces of @xmath3 , and which exploits the existence of certain rotational symmetries of @xmath3 .",
    "each face , @xmath38 , of @xmath3 is defined by the cyclically ordered vertices in its boundary , @xmath269 .",
    "suppose that we know the edge lengths of @xmath38 ( we will clarify this in section  [ twoorbits ] ) , the vertex orbits that the vertices @xmath270 lie on , and the position of the vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "we will see that then @xmath38 can also be specified by a notation of the form @xmath271 $ ] , called the _ shape _ ( or _ face shape _ ) of @xmath38 ; here , @xmath272 is a _ directed _ edge , called the _ starting edge _ , of the boundary of @xmath38 , and @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , and @xmath276 are symbols , such as  _ right _ \" or  _ left _ \" , that specify the change of direction from one edge to the next along the boundary of @xmath38 ( traversed in the order @xmath277 ) when it is projected onto @xmath262 .",
    "thus @xmath273 represents the change of direction from @xmath278 to @xmath279 at vertex @xmath265 ( as well as that from @xmath280 to @xmath281 at vertex @xmath282 , etc . ) , while @xmath274 represents the change of direction from @xmath279 to @xmath283 at vertex @xmath284 , etc . ) .",
    "we explain below why four symbols  @xmath285  suffice to describe the face .",
    "we require that the starting edges for face shapes of faces of @xmath3 all lie in the same edge orbit of directed edges under @xmath85 .",
    "this stipulation is necessary to properly compare faces of @xmath3 ; an example of such a comparison is given below .    the number of different directions in which a boundary path may continue is dependent on @xmath3 .",
    "if there is an odd number of choices then the change of direction represented by the middle path will always be designated by @xmath156 . except in the case",
    "that @xmath3 has one vertex orbit and @xmath152 is a dodecahedron , this change of direction will always be  ( _ straight _ ) _ forward _ \" , meaning that the projection of the two adjoining edges at that vertex lie in the same great circle .",
    "we shall see that , for all regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 , we will have @xmath286 if the edges have equal length and @xmath287 otherwise , since the polyhedron must have tetrahedral , octahedral , or icosahedral symmetry .",
    "it will follow from this that there are at most five possible directions in which an edge path can continue at any vertex , and so the symbols needed to denote these changes of direction have at most five possible values .",
    "if three values suffice for the symbols of a specific polyhedron @xmath3 , then we use @xmath75 , @xmath288 , and ( if needed ) @xmath156 , to represent turns to the _ right _ , turns to the _ left _ , or moves _ forward_. note that @xmath75 and @xmath288 may each represent different angles on @xmath262 for different polyhedra @xmath3 , but that within any specific polyhedron @xmath3 the angles represented do not change .",
    "if @xmath3 needs symbols with more than three values , we use @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and @xmath292 ( and possibly also @xmath156 ) , representing  _ hard right _ \" ,  _ soft right _ \" ,  _ soft left _ \" , and  _ hard left _ \" .",
    "it remains to give a justification why four symbols , like @xmath293 , are sufficient to describe any particular face .",
    "this rests on the observation that , for any face @xmath38 of @xmath3 , the automorphism @xmath236 satisfies @xmath294 and hence @xmath295 .",
    "thus the automorphism that moves the vertices and edges of @xmath38 by four steps along @xmath38 can be realized by a rotational symmetry of @xmath152 .",
    "so modulo @xmath296 , four directions ( the @xmath293 above ) are sufficient to specify @xmath38 , irrespective of the number of vertices of @xmath38 or the number of vertex orbits of @xmath3 .",
    "if the starting edge of @xmath38 is understood , we say @xmath38 is of _ shape _ [ a , b , c , d ] . in general this",
    "is not a unique designation ; @xmath38 may also be any or all of @xmath297 $ ] , @xmath298 $ ] , or @xmath299 $ ] , depending on the number of directed edge orbits of @xmath3 under @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , if we traverse the boundary of @xmath38 in the opposite direction we see that the four shapes above are the same as @xmath300 $ ] , @xmath301 $ ] , @xmath302 $ ] , and @xmath303 $ ] , where @xmath304 represents the direction @xmath305 when traversing the boundary of @xmath38 in the opposite direction . for example , if @xmath305 is  _ right _ \" or  _ left _ \" , then @xmath304 is  _ left _ \" or  _ right _ \" , respectively .",
    "note that while only the above eight face shapes are possible shapes for @xmath38 , it is not necessarily the case that each of the eight represents the face shape of f. in particular , each of the eight shapes has a different starting edge ( recall that the starting edge is a directed edge ) , and two face shapes can represent the same face only if their starting edges are equivalent under @xmath85 .",

    "thus there are only two possible configurations for @xmath3 , namely @xmath324 $ ] and @xmath328 $ ] , and these correspond , respectively , to the regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 generated as in lemma  [ index12 ] from the following ordinary regular polyhedra : +    * the tetrahedron , @xmath388 , and the petrie - dual of the tetrahedron , @xmath389 , when @xmath152 is a tetrahedron and @xmath337 is aligned with @xmath152 ; + * the cube , @xmath390 , and the petrie - dual of the cube , @xmath391 , when @xmath152 is a tetrahedron and @xmath337 is opposed to @xmath152 ; + * the dodecahedron , @xmath392 , and the petrie - dual of the dodecahedron , @xmath393 , when @xmath152 is a dodecahedron and the edge length of @xmath3 is @xmath18 ; and + * the great stellated dodecahedron , @xmath394 , and the petrie - dual of the great stellated dodecahedron , @xmath395 , when @xmath152 is a dodecahedron and the edge length of @xmath3 is @xmath8 .",
    "+    note here that , if @xmath152 is a tetrahedron and @xmath337 is opposed to @xmath152 , the projected image of a face of @xmath3 on the circumsphere of @xmath152 takes , as its vertices , the projections of certain vertices and face centers of @xmath152 .",
    "the face shapes @xmath324 $ ] and @xmath328 $ ] are taken relative to this system of points .",
    "this results in the cube or its petrie - dual .",
    "it turns out that only when the vertices of the two orbits are those of opposed tetrahedra do we get the generating ( index  @xmath18 ) polyhedron to have a symmetry group different from that of the resultant ( index  @xmath2 ) polyhedron .",
    "if @xmath152 is an octahedron , @xmath380 and there are nine possible configurations for @xmath3 , represented by @xmath324 $ ] , @xmath328 $ ] , @xmath396 $ ] , @xmath329 $ ] , @xmath325 $ ] , @xmath397 $ ] , @xmath398 $ ] , @xmath399 $ ] , and @xmath400 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath400 $ ] does not produce a ( connected ) polyhedron because all vertices in any face boundary are coplanar with @xmath106 . eliminating this , as well as duplicates caused by traversing faces in the reverse direction",
    ", we have that the only possible face configurations for @xmath3 are @xmath324 $ ] , @xmath328 $ ] , @xmath396 $ ] , and @xmath398 $ ] . examining these",
    ", we have that @xmath324 $ ] produces the regular polyhedron of index @xmath2 generated , as in lemma  [ index12 ] , from the octahedron , @xmath401 , and @xmath328 $ ] produces the polyhedron generated from the petrie - dual of the octahedron , @xmath402 . the configuration @xmath396 $ ] , which represents a face with @xmath403 , does not produce a polyhedron because every face boundary is of the cyclically ordered form @xmath404 , where @xmath405 is the vertex opposite @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , for every face with cyclically ordered vertices @xmath404 , there is also a face with cyclically ordered vertices @xmath406 , with @xmath407 opposite to @xmath408 ; these two faces both contain the adjoining edges @xmath409 and @xmath410 in their face boundaries .",
    "then these two faces completely determine the neighborhood of @xmath411 ( topologically speaking ) , forcing @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath396 $ ] can not give a polyhedron .",
    "finally , the configuration @xmath398 $ ] is combinatorially equivalent to @xmath396 $ ] ( and geometrically equivalent if we interchange @xmath152 and @xmath337 and rescale so that the edge length of @xmath152 is @xmath18 ) , and so does not produce a polyhedron either .",
    "thus there are exactly two regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 when @xmath152 is an octahedron , which are the polyhedra generated , as in lemma  [ index12 ] , from the octahedron and its petrie - dual .",
    "if @xmath152 is an icosahedron , @xmath383 and there are now sixteen possible configurations for @xmath3 , corresponding to the four possible directions in which a face boundary may continue at any vertex .",
    "as before , these include traversing the face boundary in the opposite direction .",
    "eliminating these duplications leaves the ten configurations @xmath331 $ ] , @xmath412 $ ] , @xmath413 $ ] , @xmath334 $ ] , @xmath414 $ ] , @xmath415 $ ] , @xmath416 $ ] , @xmath417 $ ] , @xmath418 $ ] , and @xmath419 $ ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath412 $ ] and @xmath413 $ ] are geometrically equivalent , as are each of the three pairs @xmath414 $ ] , @xmath415 $ ] and @xmath416 $ ] , @xmath417 $ ] and @xmath418 $ ] , @xmath419 $ ] , all four by interchanging @xmath152 and @xmath337 and rescaling .",
    "thus there are six possible configurations , for families of geometrically equivalent polyhedra , namely @xmath331 $ ] , @xmath412 $ ] , @xmath334 $ ] , @xmath414 $ ] , @xmath416 $ ] , and @xmath418 $ ] , for both edge length of @xmath18 and edge length of @xmath2 .",
    "all twelve of these configurations produce regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 , some quite remarkable . in each case",
    "it is straightforward to check that the polyhedron is combinatorially regular .",
    "together with the ten examples we have just described , this list completes the enumeration of all regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 with two vertex orbits .",
    "we further describe the twelve families of polyhedra derived from the icosahedron as follows .",
    "eight of these ( families of ) polyhedra are obtained , as in lemma  [ index12 ] , from ordinary regular polyhedra .",
    "the @xmath331 $ ] configuration produces the polyhedron generated from the icosahedron , @xmath420 , for edge length @xmath18 , and from the small stellated dodecahedron , @xmath421 , for edge length @xmath2 ; and the @xmath412 $ ] configuration gives the polyhedra derived from the petrie - duals of @xmath422 and @xmath421 for edge lengths @xmath18 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath334 $ ] configuration produces the polyhedron generated from the great dodecahedron , @xmath423 , for edge length @xmath18 , and from the great icosahedron , @xmath335 , for edge length @xmath2 ; and the @xmath414 $ ] configuration gives the polyhedra generated from the petrie - duals of @xmath423 and @xmath335 for edge lengths @xmath18 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this list of eight is complemented by another group of four families of polyhedra ( see figure  [ figpfour ] ) which can not be obtained by the method described in lemma  [ index12 ] . specifically , the @xmath416 $ ] configuration with edge length @xmath18 and the @xmath418 $ ] configuration with edge length @xmath2 determine two combinatorially equivalent orientable polyhedra of type @xmath424 , and the @xmath418 $ ] configuration with edge length @xmath18 and the @xmath416 $ ] configuration with edge length @xmath2 produce two combinatorially equivalent orientable polyhedra of type @xmath425 . these can not be obtained from ordinary regular polyhedra by means of lemma  [ index12 ] .",
    "in fact , if the vertices are forced into one orbit , by making @xmath426 , the vertices and edges of the two orbits under @xmath4 coincide , halving in number , but the faces do not ; consequently , each edge would subtend four faces , and the resulting object would not be a polyhedron .",
    "we look now at whether any polyhedra in these four families have planar faces .",
    "( we already know by lemma  [ index12 ] that each polyhedron in the other eighteen families has non - planar faces . ) for any polyhedron in either of the two families of polyhedra of type @xmath6 , the convex hull of the vertices of any face contains @xmath106 if the edge length is @xmath2 , and does not if the edge length is @xmath18 .",
    "the vertices of any face of a polyhedron of either of the two families of polyhedra of type @xmath425 lie on two parallel planes , one for each orbit , which are separated by @xmath106 when the edge length is @xmath2 , but not if the edge length is @xmath18 . thus , polyhedra of either family with edge length @xmath2 do not have planar faces , but for each of the two polyhedral families with edge length @xmath18 there is exactly one polyhedron ( denoted by a specific value of @xmath339 ) which has planar faces .",
    "this occurs when @xmath427 for the polyhedral family of type @xmath6 , and @xmath428 for the polyhedral family of type @xmath9 , where @xmath429 is the golden ratio .",
    "( recall that @xmath339 is the edge length of @xmath337 , and so is the ratio of the diameters of @xmath337 and @xmath152 . )",
    "note also that  swapping \" the orbit locations @xmath152 and @xmath337 of @xmath3 , by changing @xmath339 to the reciprocal of its original value , will result in a geometrically similar polyhedron if and only if @xmath3 has been generated , as specified in lemma  [ index12 ] , from an ordinary regular polyhedron ; polyhedra belonging to any of the four families of polyhedra just described do not maintain geometric similarity if the vertex orbits are swapped .",
    "[ enumthm ] there are precisely 22 infinite families of regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 with vertices on two orbits under the full symmetry group , where two polyhedra belong to the same family if they differ only in the relative size of the spheres containing their vertex orbits . in particular ,",
    "18 of these are related to ordinary regular polyhedra ( of index 1 ) as described in lemma  [ index12 ] . of these 22 families , the polyhedra in four have tetrahedral symmetry , in two have octahedral symmetry , and in sixteen have icosahedral symmetry .",
    "all polyhedra in these 22 families have a face - transitive symmetry group , and are orientable , but only two among them have planar faces .    a summary of these ( families of ) polyhedra is given in table  [ tabone ] , where the rows are in the same order as the diagrams in figures  [ figpone ] to [ figpsix ] .",
    "the first column lists the type @xmath430 of a polyhedron , where @xmath431 is the length of the petrie polygon , but note that this notation does not imply that @xmath3 is isomorphic to the universal regular map @xmath432 .",
    "the last column refers to the complete enumeration , up to duality , of the orientable and non - orientable regular maps of small genus by conder  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and gives the name of the underlying abstract polyhedron as a map in the listing . in particular",
    ", @xmath433 designates the @xmath434 map among the orientable ( eflexibly ) regular maps of genus @xmath100 , in the labeling of @xcite , and @xmath435 denotes its dual .",
    "thus @xmath436 is the 2nd orientable regular map of genus @xmath8 in the listing .",
    "as the listing only begins with genus @xmath2 , table  [ tabone ] has no entries for the spherical and toroidal maps @xmath437 and @xmath438 , respectively , occurring in the first four rows of the last column .",
    "moreover , the four families of polyhedra of types @xmath19 or @xmath20 are not generated from any ordinary regular polyhedron in the manner specified by lemma  [ index12 ] , and so the second column has no entries at the corresponding positions . for edge length @xmath18 ,",
    "the two families each contain exactly one polyhedron with planar faces .",
    "these two polyhedra are the only planar - faced regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 with vertices on two orbits and already occur among the five polyhedra described by wills  @xcite .",
    "we shall see in @xcite that the two maps @xmath19 or @xmath20 for these four families of  sporadic \" polyhedra are dual to the maps of two regular polyhedra of index @xmath2 with vertices on just one orbit .",
    "it is interesting to note that table  [ tabone ] provides three separate instances of four regular , but geometrically dissimilar , polyhedra having the same regular map , namely those of types @xmath439 , @xmath440 , and @xmath441 .",
    "recall that polyhedra in the same family are geometrically similar as they vary only in the value of @xmath339 , the ratio of the vertex orbit diameters , and we stipulate that @xmath442 . if @xmath339 is allowed to be negative , that is , if we reflect @xmath337 about @xmath106 , we get polyhedra that are still combinatorially equivalent , but are no longer geometrically similar .",
    "such polyhedra belong to two different families , which nevertheless have the same underlying map because of the combinatorial equivalence .",
    "the diagrams in figure  [ figpone ] and figures  [ figpthree ] , [ figpfour ] , [ figpfive ] , and [ figpsix ] have been arranged so that structures in the same vertical column belong to families related in this way , and so share the same map , and structures in the same horizontal row are petrie - duals of each other .",
    "figure  [ figptwo ] contains only two diagrams , since for octahedral symmetry the structures in the related families are also petrie duals of each other . in this way the @xmath16 families of regular polyhedra of index 2 with vertices on two orbits fall naturally into groupings of four ( or , in the case of octahedral symmetry , of two ) .",
