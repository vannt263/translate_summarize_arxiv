    "is it possible to estimate the degrees of freedom of an uncharacterized physical system ?",
    "this question has received much attention in the last years in what is known as device - independent dimension witnessing ( didw ) .",
    "it turns out that it is indeed possible to make tests about the underlying dimension of a physical system without making any assumption on it nor on the internal functioning of the measurement devices used to interact with it .",
    "dimension estimates can be constructed based only on the measurement data , i.e.  on the observed probabilities of obtaining certain outcomes conditioned on the different possible choices of measurement .",
    "these results are not only interesting from the fundamental point of view but also play a role in quantum information processing . besides allowing for experimental tests of the physical dimension @xcite , which might be considered as a resource , these investigations allow to constrain the correlations that are achievable when the setting limits the underlying dimension of the physical systems used in a protocol .",
    "these scenarios are know as semi - device - independent quantum information processing : no assumption is made on the working of the devices nor on the physical systems used except for its dimension .",
    "ideas from didw have allowed to prove the security of certain cryptographic schemes @xcite and to provide randomness - expansion protocols in this framework @xcite .",
    "moreover , didw is intimately related to the field of quantum communication complexity , which studies the minimal amount of communication parties have to exchange to successfully carry out distributed computational tasks @xcite .",
    "indeed , communication can be quantified by the dimensionality of the physical systems used to encode the messages .",
    "the first proposals for didw considered the bell scenario of quantum nonlocality since violating bell inequalities by a certain amount might require quantum systems of at least a certain dimension @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the structure of quantum correlations under dimensionality constraints has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "although other settings have been considered @xcite , a different general and simple formalism for didw was presented in @xcite in the so - called prepare - and - measure scenario , which has been largely explored afterwards @xcite . both the bell and the prepare - and - measure scenarios rely on different parties holding devices that interact with the physical system .",
    "it is usually assumed that the action of these devices might be correlated by the parties having access to a common random variable .",
    "this induces convexity into the sets of observable probability distributions corresponding to a given dimension and separation theorems can be used to obtain linear functionals that enable didw . however , shared randomness can be viewed as a resource and in certain settings it might be more natural to assume that all devices are independent ( this is the case , for example , when the devices are trusted and are not jointly conspiring to mimic higher - dimensional behaviours ) .",
    "conditions for didw with uncorrelated devices have been presented in @xcite ( prepare - and - measure scenario ) and more recently in @xcite ( bell scenario ) and @xcite ( prepare - and - measure scenario ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore the differences for didw considering whether shared randomness is available as a resource or not . in order to do this ,",
    "we analyze in detail the structure of the sets of probability distributions corresponding to a certain dimension taking into account both possibilities .",
    "we first consider the prepare - and - measure scenario and we show that quantumness and shared randomness are not comparable resources .",
    "that is , on the one hand , there exist behaviours that require a quantum system of arbitrarily large dimension in order to be observed while they can be reproduced with a classical physical system of minimal dimension together with shared randomness . on the other hand , using results from communication complexity it can be seen that there exist behaviours which require exponentially larger dimensions classically than quantumly even if the former is supplemented with shared randomness .",
    "we also show another clear difference depending on whether shared randomness is available or not . in the absence of it , the sets corresponding to a sufficiently small dimension are negligible both classically and quantumly : they are zero - measure and nowhere - dense subsets in the set of all possible behaviours",
    ". however , this is never the case in the other setting as these sets are never negligible independently of how small the dimension might be .",
    "this negligibility property also explains the exceptional robustness of dimension witnesses when devices are taken to be independent as observed in @xcite . in the second part of this article , we consider the bell scenario . the availability or not of shared randomness",
    "is known to make a difference and non - convexity results for the sets of observable probability distributions of a fixed dimension are known @xcite .",
    "here we extend these results and prove systematically some non - convexity properties for these sets for sufficiently small underlying dimension when the parties do not have access to shared randomness .",
    "furthermore , contrary again to the case of correlated devices , we also show that in this case these sets have measure zero and are nowhere dense in the set of all quantum behaviours . in order to obtain all these results we use some very simple dimension estimates based on the rank of a matrix .",
    "the prepare - and - measure scenario @xcite for witnessing dimensions in a device - independent way is the following .",
    "there are two parties , alice ( or a ) and bob ( or b ) , which receive respectively inputs @xmath0 and @xmath1 from finite alphabets @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "their only chance to communicate is by a sending a classical or quantum physical system to b depending on her input .",
    "the dimension of this system , to be defined precisely below , quantifies the amount of communication used . upon receival of the message ,",
    "b interacts with the system by performing a measurement depending on his input and produces an output @xmath4 which can take values in a finite alphabet . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider this output to be binary , i.  e.  @xmath5 .",
    "then , we can record the conditional probabilities with which each output occurs for any given pair of inputs : @xmath6 .",
    "this is the main object in a device - independent scenario and we will refer to it as behaviour and denote it by @xmath7 .",
    "of course , as conditional probabilities , behaviours are characterized by @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the question to be addressed in this setting is the following . without using any knowledge on how a and b process their information ,",
    "what is the minimal amount of classical or quantum communication sent from a to b that is compatible with the observation of a given behaviour ?",
    "the possible classical messages @xmath12 are given by dits , i.  e.  @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the amount of classical communication is measured by the dimension of the message @xmath14",
    ". a always has the chance to use a random strategy , i.  e.  she can send a message @xmath15 given @xmath0 with probability @xmath16 , and so does b , i.  e.  he can produce an output @xmath4 given @xmath1 and the reception of @xmath15 with probability @xmath17 . in the quantum case a sends quantum states @xmath18 .",
    "the dimension of her message is thus @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for the support of an operator . in order to produce his output ,",
    "b can interact with the message through a quantum measurement conditioned on his input .",
    "thus , we define the set of behaviours obtained by sending classical messages of dimension at most @xmath14 by @xmath21 ( this and the other sets to be defined below also depend on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which we drop to ease the notation since these quantities should be in general clear from the context ) . in other words , @xmath24 when @xmath25 on the other hand , @xmath26 denotes the set of behaviours achievable by sending quantum states of dimension at most @xmath14 .",
    "that is , @xmath27 if there exists measurements for b , @xmath28 with @xmath29 @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are of dimension less or equal to @xmath14 ( cf .",
    "( [ quantumdim ] ) ) .    as already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", this does not exhaust all possibilities .",
    "depending on the physical setting a and b may be granted with another resource to build their strategy : shared randomness .",
    "this means that a and b may pre - establish the strategy each will follow depending on the value of a random variable they both have access to .",
    "this boils down to the fact that they can prepare any convex combination of their previously allowed behaviours .",
    "thus , we define the sets of behaviours obtained by sending classical or quantum messages of dimension at most @xmath14 together with shared randomness by @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for the convex hull . the sets @xmath21 and @xmath26 need not be convex so in general we have strict inclusions @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this means that shared randomness is indeed a resource which can allow to perform some tasks using less communication . on the other hand , we clearly have as well the inclusions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which can also be seen to be in general strict .",
    "that is , quantum strategies are also a resource over classical strategies in order to reduce the amount of communication .    , all inclusions among sets are clear except for those corresponding to classical communication together with shared randomness and quantum communication without shared randomness . ]",
    "notice that if @xmath39 , the scenario is trivial .",
    "a can unambiguously encode the value of her input into her message to b , who can then use his private randomness to output any possible behaviour .",
    "hence , @xmath40 , which constitute the set of all behaviours in a given setting .",
    "thus , given any valid behaviour there always exist values of the dimension in which it is realizable in any of the aforementioned sets , since in the worst case we have @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , it is always well defined to ask what the minimal value of the dimension is to obtain some behaviour in any of the four sets of possible strategies .",
    "taking into account the inclusions pointed out above , it comes as a natural question what the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath26 is ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "moreover , given the status of both quantumness and shared randomness as a resource , it is interesting to know if one can exchange one for the other or if one is strictly more powerful than the other .",
    "actually , this is a standard question in the context of communication complexity @xcite . here",
    ", one usually seeks for differences in @xmath14 which are larger than a logarithmic cost over @xmath22 as this is considered negligible with respect to the size of the input : the so - called exponential separations .",
    "we will show that there exist scenarios in which @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with both separations being exponential ( or even arbitrary ) .",
    "the second inclusion is a straightforward observation from known results in communication complexity . in order to establish the first one",
    ", we will first observe in the following subsection some very simple dimension estimates based on the rank of a matrix associated to @xmath7 .",
    "using again these estimates , we will finish this section by showing the negligibility of low - dimensional sets in the absence of shared randomness .",
    "this explains the exceptional robustness to noise of dimension witnessing in this scenario and provides a clear contrast to the case where this resource is available .",
    "the fact that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are convex sets allows to separate each set from its complement by linear functionals on the behaviours .",
    "this gives rise to the so - called linear dimension witnesses @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath47 and @xmath48 was recently addressed in @xcite , which obtained some non - linear dimension witness for these non - convex sets .",
    "specifically , they consider the scenario in which @xmath49 and show that the @xmath50 matrix @xmath51 with entries @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is such that @xmath54 for all behaviours in @xmath21 ( @xmath26 ) with @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus , the determinant of @xmath51 being non - zero allows one to establish non - trivial lower bounds on the required dimensionality both in the classical and quantum case .    in the following we obtain more refined estimates . in order to do so and to deal with behaviours",
    ", we will arrange the array of numbers given by @xmath7 into a matrix @xmath57 according to the rule @xmath58 where in the standard notation of quantum mechanics @xmath59 and @xmath60 denotes the computational basis of @xmath61 and similarly for the other alphabet elements .",
    "in other words , @xmath62 takes the form    @xmath63    now , in the case @xmath24 , we can make the following immediate observation . since the behaviour is given by eq .",
    "( [ setc ] ) , we have that @xmath64 for some real ( actually non - negative ) vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 of size @xmath22 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "thus , we clearly see that if @xmath24 , then @xmath68 . on the other hand , if the behaviour is quantum , eq .",
    "( [ setq ] ) tells us that its entries are given by the hilbert - schmidt inner product of pairs of hermitian matrices of size @xmath69 .",
    "this set of matrices forms a subspace which is isomorphic to @xmath70 .",
    "thus , there exists vectors @xmath71 and @xmath72 in this space such that @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we now have that if @xmath27 , then @xmath74 .    [ obsest ] if @xmath24 , then @xmath75 while if @xmath27 , then @xmath76 .",
    "these simple observations generalize the previous aforementioned result of @xcite in several ways .",
    "first , we do not put any constraint on the size of the alphabets @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "second , the estimates are finer since we do not rely on a matrix being of full rank or not but the bound is sensitive to the different possible values of the rank .",
    "it should be mentioned that the result of bowles _",
    "based on the @xmath77 matrix is also obtained by showing that the entries of this matrix are given by the inner product of a set of vectors .",
    "thus , rank estimates are also possible in this case . in more detail",
    ", one obtains that @xmath78 if @xmath24 and @xmath79 if @xmath27 .",
    "hence , it comes as a natural question whether it is better to use @xmath62 or @xmath77 to get the strongest estimate .",
    "notice that , in the @xmath49 setting , the maximal possible rank of @xmath62 is @xmath80 ( this is because several columns are surely linearly dependent due to the condition @xmath10 @xmath11 ) while for @xmath77 it is obviously @xmath81 .",
    "thus , in the case of maximal rank both approaches yield equal estimates . in the appendix",
    "we show that @xmath82 .",
    "thus , this suggests that it is generally better to use @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , it can only be worse in cases for which @xmath83 .",
    "however , this can only lead to a difference of one in the estimate ( and not always in the quantum case since it holds for many natural numbers @xmath84 that @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that stronger bounds on @xmath14 can be placed by using generalizations of the rank @xcite .",
    "recent literature has established an intimate relation between the non - negative rank and the classical dimension and the positive semidefinite rank and the quantum dimension in similar scenarios @xcite .",
    "it is immediate to check that the nonnegative rank of @xmath62 and the positive semidefinite rank of @xmath62 are lower bounds for @xmath14 in the classical and quantum case respectively in the scenario considered here .",
    "reference @xcite also offers related strategies to bound the dimension .",
    "however , we stick here to the weaker rank estimates because they seem much easier to use . in fact , we do not know efficient algorithms to compute these other notions of the rank @xcite .      in this subsection we will show that @xmath43 with an arbitrary separation : there exist behaviours requiring a constant amount of classical communication together with shared randomness ( actually just one bit ) while the necessary quantum communication increases at least as @xmath86 . in more detail , we will consider general scenarios such that @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( this condition is only to make possible that the matrices of behaviours can have the largest possible rank , @xmath80 ) and we will construct behaviours @xmath89 for any natural @xmath81 which they all belong to @xmath90 but can not belong to @xmath91 .",
    "the idea is to mix a sufficient number of behaviours in @xmath92 such that the corresponding matrix @xmath93 has its rank as large as possible so that observation [ obsest ] leads us to conclude that @xmath94 in order for @xmath95 to hold .",
    "an example of such a construction goes as follows . here and throughout this paper",
    "we will denote by @xmath96 the vector of @xmath97 that has zeroes everywhere except a 1 in the @xmath98th entry .",
    "consider the behaviour @xmath99 in the aforementioned setting whose @xmath100 matrix is given by ( to ease the notation we drop the dependence on @xmath81 )    @xmath101    the second way to write @xmath102 shows clearly that @xmath103 : b outputs all the time @xmath104 except maybe when @xmath105 depending on the bit sent by a , her action relying on whether she gets the input @xmath106 or any other .",
    "we can similarly define the behaviours @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) whose matrices are all made by @xmath109 blocks given by @xmath110 except at the position @xmath111 where it is given by @xmath112 . by the same arguments as above , we have that @xmath113 @xmath114 .",
    "it is easy to see that any non - trivial mixture of all these behaviours has maximal rank .",
    "taking for instance @xmath115 we find that @xmath116 where @xmath117 now , one can see that @xmath93 has the largest possible rank , i.  e.  @xmath118 .",
    "this is because , on the one hand , all even columns are clearly linearly independent , i.e.  @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "on the other hand , if we add to this set any other odd column , the set remains linearly independent because this column has non - zero entries where all the others have a zero entry ( from the @xmath121th entry to the @xmath15th ) .",
    "thus , using observation [ obsest ] , we finally obtain that if @xmath95 it must hold that @xmath94 while , by construction , @xmath122 @xmath123 . in passing , since obviously @xmath124 @xmath123",
    ", this also shows the non - convexity of @xmath26 ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .      the results of @xcite discussed before show that there is a quadratic gap between @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "interestingly , this gap can be seen to be exponential and extended to @xmath127 .",
    "testing classical and quantum dimensions in the prepare - and - measure scenario is intimately connected to the field of communication complexity when restricted to the scenario of one - way communication complexity .",
    "in fact , this setting is the same with the only difference that it is task - oriented . in this case , under the same restrictions a and b now have the goal of evaluating with high probability of success a binary function @xmath128 of their inputs that is known to both of them .",
    "that is , their strategies should aim at preparing behaviours @xmath6 for which the result @xmath129 is much more likely than @xmath130 .",
    "the field of communication complexity studies what is the least amount of communication ( from a to b in the one way case ) necessary to evaluate different functions .",
    "the possible benefits of using quantum communication over classical communication have been extensively studied in the last years and there are several scenarios for which it is known that certain functions can be evaluated with a given probability of success requiring exponentially less communication in the quantum case than in the case of classical messages @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the one - way scenario is not an exception and refs .",
    "@xcite provide instances of this situation for the case of partial functions . in more detail",
    ", @xcite considers a function , @xmath131 , for which a receives an @xmath84-bit string @xmath0 ( i.  e.  @xmath132 ) and b a @xmath133 permutation matrix @xmath134 ( i.  e.  @xmath135 ) .",
    "the goal is to output 1 if @xmath136 and 0 if @xmath137 and @xmath0 are sufficiently different ( in a precise way which is irrelevant here ) .",
    "this is an example of a partial function or a function with a promise , a and b are guaranteed to receive a strict subset of the inputs @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( those for which any of the above conditions hold ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that a quantum strategy solves this function using @xmath138 qubits of communication ( i.  e.  @xmath139 ) while there can not exist any classical strategy solving @xmath131 using less than of the order of @xmath140 bits .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath44 . to see this ,",
    "consider any behaviour corresponding to the aforementioned quantum strategies that solve @xmath131 .",
    "it must then fulfill that @xmath141 for some @xmath139 .",
    "however , it can not be that @xmath142 as this would be in contradiction to the result of @xcite .",
    "indeed , any behaviour in @xmath42 can not have the same entries as @xmath143 over the subset of promised inputs @xmath0 and @xmath1 since it could then be used to solve @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , it must be that @xmath144 with @xmath145 scaling at least as @xmath146 .",
    "interestingly , there is roughly no difference between @xmath21 and @xmath42 for the evaluation of functions .",
    "theorem @xcite shows in the one - way communication scenario that classical strategies with shared randomness that solve some function can be turned into successful strategies without shared randomness with just a logarithmic overhead .",
    "thus , if there exists some exponential gap for the solution of a function with quantum and classical resources , it must persist if we allow classical resources supplemented with shared randomness .    in the light of communication complexity",
    ", the reader might wonder whether the results of the previous section showing behaviours which required overwhelmingly more quantum communication to be prepared than classical communication together with shared randomness could be used to devise functions whose solution has a similar gap , i.  e.  functions that are at least exponentially cheaper to solve classically if shared randomness is allowed than quantumly .",
    "however , newman s theorem forbids this possibility . in what comes to the evaluation of functions ,",
    "the differences with and without shared randomness can be at most logarithmic in the one - way scenario even if one just uses classical messages .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the prepare - and - measure scenario was introduced to certify the dimension of uncharacterized physical systems in a device - independent way , i.e.  based solely on the observed statistics and without any assumption on the internal working of the devices used . in this context",
    "any condition expressed in terms of the observed behaviour that guarantees that a and b exchange physical systems of at least a certain dimension is usually referred to as a dimension witness .",
    "the rank estimates introduced in sec .",
    "[ estimates ] are therefore an example of such an object . in practice , the measurement device can not be perfectly isolated from external noise introducing errors in the experimentally reconstructed behaviour , which can make it less dimensional .",
    "the robustness of a dimension witness characterizes its noise tolerance in these scenarios and plays a crucial role in dimensionality certification .",
    "although not strictly necessary , in this setting a natural assumption is that the preparing and measuring devices are uncorrelated ( i.e.  the preparer and the measurer are not maliciously conspiring to fool the certifier ) and , hence , in this case one takes that shared randomness is not available .",
    "thus , the problem here boils down to identifying what is the smallest @xmath14 such that @xmath24 or @xmath27 .",
    "this was the motivation of @xcite to introduce the dimension witness based on the determinant of the matrix @xmath51 that we have reviewed in sec .",
    "[ estimates ] .",
    "it was observed there that these witnesses are extraordinarily robust tolerating arbitrary amounts of noise . in this section",
    "we investigate the structure of the sets @xmath21 and @xmath26 from this point of view and find reasons for this exceptional robustness .",
    "low - dimensional sets are negligibly small in the set of all possible behaviours : they are nowhere dense and have measure zero .",
    "hence , very contrived forms of noise are required to drastically reduce the dimension .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case where shared randomness is available since , as we also discuss here , the sets @xmath42 and @xmath147 are not negligible @xmath148 .",
    "we finish this section by observing that rank estimates are also extremely robust under any physically reasonable form of noise .",
    "notice that evaluating the rank of a matrix is an ill - conditioned problem . due to the estimates presented in sec .",
    "[ estimates ] , this indicates that small perturbations of a behaviour could increase considerably the required dimension to prepare it . furthermore , for general matrices",
    "it is well - known that lower - rank matrices are of measure zero and nowhere dense among matrices of higher rank .",
    "this suggests that lower - dimensional sets of behaviours might be negligible .",
    "we formalize this in the following .",
    "[ obsnegl ] in every scenario with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the sets @xmath21 with @xmath149 and @xmath26 with @xmath150 have measure zero and are nowhere dense in the set of all possible behaviours @xmath151 .",
    "we will show that the set of rank - deficient behaviours ( i.e.  @xmath152 ) , which we will denote by @xmath153 , is of measure zero and nowhere dense in @xmath151 . since in the classical case",
    "we have seen that @xmath68 , when @xmath149 we have that @xmath154 and the result follows .",
    "the same applies to the quantum case .",
    "the proof of the claim for rank - deficient behaviours follows basically in a straightforward manner the analogous case for general matrices .",
    "let us first show that @xmath153 has measure zero .",
    "notice that the set of behaviours is a subset of @xmath155 determined by specifying an arbitrary collection of values @xmath156 @xmath11 and it has non - zero lebesgue measure .",
    "when @xmath157 , this additionally imposes that the determinants of certain square submatrices vanish , which is a polynomial in the matrix entries , i.e.  in the @xmath158 .",
    "however , the zero set of a polynomial must have measure zero ( unless it is the zero polynomial ) .",
    "hence , @xmath153 has lebesgue measure equal to zero .",
    "let us now see that @xmath153 is nowhere dense .",
    "for this we have to see that the closure of @xmath153 , @xmath159 , has empty interior .",
    "since we are dealing with finite - dimensional matrices , for these topological considerations we can take any matrix norm @xmath160 .",
    "first of all , it is useful to notice that @xmath153 is closed .",
    "this is because @xmath153 is characterized by the determinant of all @xmath161 submatrices of @xmath62 being zero .",
    "hence , the set is the preimage of a closed set under a continuous map ( the determinant is a polynomial of the matrix entries ) and it is therefore closed .",
    "now , since @xmath162 , we just need to check that @xmath153 has an empty interior .",
    "clearly , general rank - deficient matrices can always be approximated by full - rank matrices .",
    "it remains to see the same being careful that the full - rank approximation can be chosen to be a behaviour as well .",
    "for this , take any @xmath157 and define for any @xmath163 $ ] @xmath164 where @xmath165 with the @xmath166-dimensional vectors @xmath167 defined by    @xmath168    notice that @xmath169 is a valid behaviour and , therefore , so is @xmath170 @xmath171 .",
    "it is important to notice that the @xmath167 are linearly independent ( li ) vectors . that the first @xmath81 of them are li is clear because each of them has a nonzero entry where all the others are zero .",
    "to see that adding @xmath172 to the set keeps it li we notice the following .",
    "this vector has its second entry equal to zero , which is the case for all of the others except @xmath173 . thus if @xmath172 could be obtained as a linear combination of the other vectors , the weight of @xmath173 has to be zero .",
    "iterating this argument for all even entries of @xmath172 we obtain the claim . now , because @xmath62 and @xmath169 are behaviours and the @xmath167 are nonnegative vectors , we have that @xmath174 and @xmath175 are nonnegative vectors too @xmath176 . moreover , by construction @xmath177 @xmath176 and , therefore , @xmath178 @xmath176 and all @xmath179 .",
    "since the @xmath167 are li this implies that @xmath180 and , hence , given that the dimension of the kernel and the rank must add up to the number of columns @xmath166 , @xmath181 @xmath182 , i.e.  @xmath183 @xmath182 .",
    "thus , we finally see that @xmath184 and @xmath185 , @xmath186 such that @xmath187 ( for this it suffices to take @xmath188 with @xmath189 sufficiently small ) .",
    "hence , @xmath153 does not contain any nonempty open set , i.e.  it has empty interior as we wanted to prove . ) will be used through the paper . ]",
    "thus , the sets @xmath21 with @xmath149 and @xmath26 with @xmath150 are negligibly small and @xmath190 and @xmath191 have full measure and a dense interior .",
    "it might be that the conditions @xmath149 and @xmath150 are an artifact of the proof due to the rank estimates and that the above claim can be extended to larger values of @xmath192 .",
