    "referring to partial results of his predecessors ( most notably @xcite ) , @xcite forged the acronym ` yorp effect ' ( yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack ) to describe the influence of radiation effects on the rotation of a sun - orbiting object .",
    "the radiation incident on the surface of a celestial body acts in three different ways : by the direct pressure , by the recoil force of reflected photons , and by the thermal radiation force .    according to a simple geometric argument of @xcite , further elaborated by @xcite and @xcite , the average torque due to direct radiation pressure vanishes .",
    "physical properties of asteroid surfaces do not suggest a significant contribution of specular reflection , so we may focus on the remaining two phenomena : scattered ( i.e. diffusively reflected ) radiation and thermal re - radiation , defining the yorp torque @xmath0 as the sum @xmath1 of the torque @xmath2 generated by the scattered radiation , and of the grey body thermal radiation torque @xmath3 .    within our present lambertian model ,",
    "the primary definitions of the yorp torque components in reference frame attached to an object s centre of mass are given as integrals over the body surface : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scattered fraction of incident power flux  the product of albedo @xmath6 and of the flux @xmath7 hitting the infinitesimal surface element @xmath8 , and @xmath9 where the re - radiated energy flux is the product of the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath10 , grey body emissivity factor @xmath11 and the fourth power of surface temperature @xmath12 .",
    "both terms are divided by the velocity of light @xmath13 .",
    "conservation of energy on the body surface implies that @xmath14 so the absorbed flux @xmath15 is distributed between the re - radiation , proportional to @xmath16 , and conduction term given as the product of thermal conductivity @xmath17 and the normal derivative of temperature  the gradient projected on the outward normal unit vector @xmath18 .    substituting the boundary condition ( [ bc:1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ m : t ] ) we can merge a part of @xmath3 with @xmath2 , so that the yorp torque becomes the sum @xmath19 of the principal term @xmath20 and the complement due to conductivity @xmath21    the subscript @xmath22 refers to the usual ` rubincam approximation ' of zero conductivity , and the problem of finding @xmath23 is actually an exercise in computational geometry .",
    "its most difficult part is the evaluation of @xmath7 , discussed in sect .",
    "[ insol ] .",
    "computing the conductivity term @xmath24 requires solving the heat diffusion equation .",
    "our simplified 1d thermal model is presented in sect .",
    "[ thermal ] .",
    "two of its possible extensions are given in appendices [ regol ] and [ finde ] , but the latter serves mostly as a theoretical argument and has not been implemented .",
    "the results of test runs with asteroids @xmath25 and 6489 golevka are presented in sect .",
    "[ tests ] . in our opinion",
    ", they reveal a previously unnoticed seasonal yorp effect in attitude . additional assumptions of our model are enumerated in sect .",
    "[ prelim ] , but we hope to relax them in future .",
    "although there are many possible ways to describe the shape of a celestial body , the yorp studies practically rely on two variants : a spherical harmonics model ( typical for analytical considerations ) or a triangular mesh .",
    "we adopt the latter as more general , capable of representing even very irregular objects , and more suitable for the occlusion tests . as a consequence ,",
    "an integral over the body surface becomes the sum of cubatures over all triangular patches forming the mesh .",
    "of course , the real information about the surface points is given only at the vertices @xmath26 , so the values of distance or any other coordinates dependent function have to be interpolated on a patch . in principle",
    ", it can be done using various interpolation rules , even the ones that involve the whole set of vertices , but in the yorp practice all authors rely on the local , linear interpolation , considering flat triangles and replacing all cubatures over triangular patches by the first order gaussian midpoint rule @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the area of a triangle determined by vertices @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the centroid @xmath33 in particular , the oriented surface vectors @xmath34 are constant on each triangular face , easily computed as @xmath35    of course , the mesh should be properly oriented , so that @xmath36 computed from eq .",
    "( [ sj ] ) is always directed along the outward normal .",
    "the routine tests rely on checking the gauss identity @xmath37 followed by asking if the volume resulting from the sum of oriented tetrahedral simplices @xmath38 is positive , when all @xmath39 faces are included . yet , even if both tests have been passed , there remains a number of possible degeneracies , like edges shared by more than two triangles , duplicated vertices etc .",
    ", that are best to be checked before using the mesh .",
    "thus , for a model of a celestial body with @xmath39 triangular faces , the yorp torque is approximated as a sum @xmath40 with @xmath41 where two terms in the bracket are : @xmath42  the incident power flux evaluated at the centroid @xmath32 , and @xmath43_{{\\bmath{r}}_j}.\\ ] ] these two terms are responsible for the rubincam part and the conductivity complement , respectively .",
    "although recent works of @xcite and @xcite have revealed the importance of tumbling rotation for the dynamics under the yorp torque , we adhere to the usual assumption of the rotation around the principal axis of inertia  the @xmath44 unit vector of the body - frame basis .",
    "the principal axis mode remains a decent approximation over significant fragments of the evolutionary paths presented by @xcite , and in some instances it may be possible to incorporate tumbling by rotating the basis with respect to the principal axes .",
    "so , we consider the principal axis mode equations of motion for the rotation rate @xmath45 , the obliquity @xmath46 ( the angle between the normal to the orbital plane and the spin vector @xmath47 , parallel to @xmath44 ) , and the sidereal time @xmath48 ( measured from the ascending node of the sun on the object s equator to the body - frame basis @xmath49 vector ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 designates the maximum moment of inertia in the principal axes frame .",
    "according to the above equations , the dynamics is governed by the components of the yorp torque @xmath0 in another kind of equatorial reference frame @xmath52 ( see fig .  [ fig:01 ] ) with the same ( centre of mass ) origin as the body frame @xmath53 , with the same @xmath54 direction , but with the remaining axes related to the equinox instead of to the principal axes @xcite @xmath55      from the point of view of long term , systematic influence of the yorp effect , we are mostly interested in the mean values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with all daily and orbital periodic effects averaged out . thus , assuming a uniform rotation with constant frequency @xmath45 and the keplerian motion around the sun , we need to find the mean values , defined for any function @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mean anomaly of the sun .",
    "we perform this averaging indirectly , working with discrete fourier transforms ( dft ) of @xmath62 .",
    "using the conventions described in appendix  [ ap : a ] , we assume @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the dft of the function @xmath59 , and @xmath65 is the vector of samples of this function at different @xmath48 and @xmath61 values .",
    "according to eq .",

    "but the averaging of the next two terms is slightly more involved : confronting eq .",

    "the major difficulty in dealing with the rubincam part of the yorp effect is the computation of @xmath7 , known as the insolation or irradiation function . in principle , the incident energy flux hitting a given surface element is a sum of two components : the direct flux from the sun , and the radiation exchange complement , i.e. the energy coming from other elements of the body surface ( either reflected or re - emitted ) . in the present paper",
    "we adhere to the approximation used in all previous works and consider only the direct part @xmath73 where @xmath74 designates the solar radiation power flux at a given distance of the body from the sun @xmath75 . using the solar constant @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 with the reference distance @xmath78 .",
    "defining and computing the visibility function @xmath79 is the heart of the problem .",
    "its values are either @xmath80 , when the sun is not visible over the current surface element , or 1 otherwise . for convex bodies",
    ", @xmath79 depends only on the scalar product of the outward normal unit vector @xmath81 and the unit vector directed to the sun @xmath82 . in other words , whenever the zenith distance of the sun is less than @xmath83 , the visibility function @xmath84 , because the formal horizon ( a local tangent plane perpendicular to @xmath81 ) and the actual horizon ( the part of a celestial hemisphere not occluded by other surface elements ) coincide for a convex object . in this case , computing @xmath79 is so cheap and easy , that often the bodies of an arbitrary shape are formally treated as convex when computing @xmath7 , which is necessary in analytical theories @xcite , and handy in numerical or some semi - analytical models @xcite .",
    "however , the weakness of such pseudo - convex treatment for irregular , bouldered and cratered objects , testified by @xcite and  in a quite different form  by @xcite , suggests to avoid it whenever possible , unless the shape model is known in advance to be convex ( e.g. when it comes from the convex lightcurve inversion algorithm ) .",
    "leaving aside the visibility function algorithms , to be discussed in next subsections , we begin computations with tabulating the flux @xmath74 and the components of @xmath82 in the orbital frame for the mean anomaly @xmath61 sampled at @xmath85 equidistant points in the full angle range @xmath86 . in the orbital frame , the direction cosines are formally @xmath87_\\mathrm{orb } = \\left (    \\begin{array}{c }      \\cos{\\left(\\omega_\\mathrm{o}+ f_\\mathrm{o}\\right ) } \\\\",
    "\\sin{\\left(\\omega_\\mathrm{o}+f_\\mathrm{o}\\right ) } \\\\      0 \\\\    \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the argument of perihelion and @xmath89 is the true anomaly of the sun .",
    "thus the two nonzero components and @xmath74 are tabulated once , before the the main loop over surface triangles begins , so the cost of solving kepler equation is relatively negligible .",
    "other quantities precomputed before the main algorithm starts are : centroid positions @xmath32 , areas @xmath28 , and unit normal vectors @xmath90 associated with each triangular face .    given a pair of mean anomaly and rotation phase @xmath91 we transform the solar vector to the body frame by means of two rotations : around the first axis by angle @xmath92 , and then around the third axis by angle @xmath48 , so that @xmath93_\\mathrm{orb},\\ ] ] where ` * ' are placeholders for irrelevant matrix entries .",
    "the fundamental operation in the evaluation of the visibility function is the ` stabbing query ' , i.e. testing the intersection of a ray @xmath94 with other surface triangles .",
    "this standard tool of computational geometry is well documented @xcite , so we skip the details focusing on a less trivial question : how to minimize the number of its calls .",
    "obviously , there is no need to perform the query when the sun is below the formal horizon , i.e. when @xmath95 .",
    "so , the most straightforward selection tool is to create for each @xmath67 a list of all triangles with at least one vertex above the formal horizon and , if @xmath96 , perform the queries only with triangles from the list . but",
    "expecting that the list should be short is wishful thinking , based upon a false intuition of a flat landscape with distant mountains on the horizon and plenty of clear sky above a spectator s head .",
    "quite a number of difficult to spot errors may arise if an optimized visibility algorithm is created with such a picture in mind .",
    "if there are craters or boulders on an asteroid , one should rather try to imagine the landscape seen by an ant climbing a pit or walking on a side of a boulder surrounded by other rough terrain features .",
    "the region of a clear sky can be a small , irregular , non - convex area , and its intersection with the daily sun path can be a union of disjoint segments . for a triangle on a boulder or a crater side , up to 90% of remaining triangles may stretch above the formal horizon , and it means that the number of queries should be additionally optimized .",
    "an optimization method , very briefly reported in the paper of @xcite , relies on a horizon map  a 1d array of maximum elevation of surface features above the formal horizon on a grid of local azimuth values for a given triangle .",
    "however , it is not clear from the author s description how far his approach is based upon the ` hills on a horizon ' paradigm and whether he avoided the problems arising when some triangles overhang the local zenith , because then the altitude of clear sky has both the lower and the upper bound ( smaller than @xmath83 ) .",
    "another , more robust way to handle the optimization , applied in papers like @xcite , and described in ( * ? ? ? * appendix  b2 ) , amounts to creating a huge collection of 2d visibility tables for a specific object . for each surface triangle ,",
    "a longitude - latitude mercator map with 0/1 values on a @xmath97 grid is first computed and stored in a file . during the yorp computation , the longitude and latitude of the sun",
    "are rounded to full degrees and compared with the related entry of the visibility table .",
    "creating the tables is time consuming , but performed only once for a given object .",
    "the drawbacks are : fixed discretisation error with uneven resolution on a sphere , and huge file space requirements . the largest shape model attacked with this approach was the triangulated itokawa shape with @xmath98 facets @xcite",
    "our approach is an attempt to join the robustness of @xcite with the potential efficiency of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the method has already proved its valor in computing the rubincam part of the yorp effect for itokawa and eros using their models of over @xmath99 triangular faces @xcite .",
    "computing the yorp torques for a number of obliquity values @xmath100 , we use the following arrangement of loops : triangles(obliquity(orbit(rotation ) ) .",
    "the efficiency of our approach hinges upon the possibility of considering surface elements one by one in the outermost loop , which is possible within the assumptions of the illumination and thermal model of the present work , although suppressing the present restrictions in future , we will most likely find ourselves in a less comfortable situation .    for a current surface triangle",
    "@xmath67 we first create a ` horizon array ' , partitioning the local hemisphere into a fixed number of sectors ( along meridians ) and zones ( along constant altitude circles ) . a typical setup uses about 100 sectors and 64 zones .",
    "each triangle above the formal horizon is centrally projected onto the unit sphere with the origin at @xmath32 in order to find its ` bounding box ' in azimuth and altitude .",
    "the problem has its own subtleties : the extreme azimuth values are those of the vertices , but care must be taken about the cases of crossing the zero meridian ; on the other hand , the extremes of altitude are often different from the altitude of vertices due to the bending of a straight edge in central projection . and , last but not least , if some triangle is intersected by the local zenith line ( parallel to the normal vector @xmath90 ) , it should be marked as a ` zenith triangle ' and requires a special treatment , having a constant altitude circle as the bounding box .",
    "in addition to the bounding box determination , each triangle @xmath101 is also labeled as foreground or background object , depending on the sign of the scalar product of its outward normal vector @xmath102 and the relative position of its centre @xmath103 .",
    "obviously , if any ray @xmath104 intersects a foreground triangle , it must intersect a background triangle as well , hence  for economy of time and storage  we select a less populated of the foreground and background subsets of faces above the formal horizon as the candidates for future stabbing queries .",
    "once the first loop over triangles @xmath105 is completed , the horizon array is dynamically created with an appropriate size . then , in the second loop over @xmath105 , the number @xmath101 is stored in the lists referring to all zone - sector cells covered by the bounding box of the @xmath101-th triangle .",
    "thus we create the horizon array  a set of lists containing possible occluders for a given solar altitude and azimuth .",
    "actually , the array covers the entire hemisphere only in the presence of a zenith triangle . if no such face is detected , we record the the bounding altitude of the clear sky cap and set the horizon array cells subdividing only the sector between the formal horizon and the clear sky limit circle .",
    "after that , the remaining computations are straightforward : fixing the value of obliquity ( or opening the obliquity loop ) we sample the rotation phase and mean anomaly , and for each pair of these angles compute the sun vector @xmath82 .",
    "if the sun is above the formal horizon , we select an appropriate entry of the horizon array and perform stabbing queries with triangles from the list , until we record the intersection ( @xmath80 ) or the end of the list is reached ( @xmath106 ) . having collected all values of the insolation function @xmath107 , we perform the dft and find the requested amplitudes @xmath108 $ ] , and @xmath109 $ ] . of course , a simple arithmetic mean can be used instead of the dft ( as we did in @xcite ) , but the complete spectrum is required to compute the conductivity terms , as described in the next section .",
    "the surface temperature gradient , required by the conductivity complement , is obtained by solving the heat diffusion equation @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the density and @xmath112 is the specific heat capacity of the object . if we assume that conductivity @xmath17 is independent on temperature and has the same value in the entire volume of the body , we reduce eq .",
    "( [ four:1 ] ) to the form @xmath113 where the thermal diffusivity @xmath114 , defined as @xmath115 will be assumed constant , leading to the homogeneous body thermal model .",
    "the plane - parallel model ( ppm ) results from two simplifying assumptions : i ) the penetration depth of the heat wave is small compared with the radius of curvature for all fragments of the body surface , and ii ) there is no heat exchange in the direction perpendicular to the surface normal . both the assumptions are plausible for large objects with a low conductivity and a smooth , preferably convex surface . in ppm",
    "we introduce the depth variable @xmath116 whose values increase from @xmath117 on the surface to higher positive values inside the body .",
    "the basic equation of the homogenous body ppm is a reduced form of ( [ four:2 ] ) @xmath118 with nonlinear robin boundary conditions @xmath119 on the surface , and neumann boundary condition in the limit of infinite depth @xmath120 in both cases we use @xmath121 and eq .",
    "( [ bc:3 ] ) results from the energy balance ( [ bc:1 ] ) with @xmath122 accordingly , eq .",
    "( [ tprim ] ) can be replaced by @xmath123    instead of initial conditions at some specified epoch @xmath124 , we impose the quasi - periodicity condition , requiring that all transient terms have been damped after sufficient relaxation time .",
    "this condition is most easily imposed by assuming from the beginning that @xmath12 is replaced by its dft with respect to rotation phase @xmath48 and mean anomaly @xmath61 .    since the assumptions of ppm exclude the heat transfer between adjacent triangles ( and their associated volumes )",
    ", we may consider each body fragment separately , so the index referring to a particular face ( like @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ tprim : pp ] ) ) will be omitted in the following discussion .",

    "of the helmholtz equation helped us to demonstrate , that the yorp effect in rotation period is the same in the rubincam s approximation ( @xmath212 ) and in various 1d thermal models .",
    "as long as one neglects the heat transfer between adjacent surface elements , the values of @xmath56 do not depend on conductivity , regardless of the body size and radial homogeneity assumptions . from the point of view of observational detection of yorp , always based upon @xmath56 ,",
    "this is a nice conclusion ; not only because the rubincam s model is easier to compute , but also it requires less physical parameters to be known , since then  at least for the lambertian scattering and emission  emissivity and albedo values do not matter . as a matter of fact",
    ", the conclusion can be also given a straightforward physical explanation .",
    "if the heat conduction is restricted to the direction normal to the surface , a nonzero mean value of the the temperature normal gradient @xmath294 should imply systematic heating or cooling of asteroid s interior .",
    "hence , the property that @xmath295 follows directly from the request of the energetic equilibrium state with transient terms relaxed .",
    "however , according to the analytical model of @xcite , the yorp torque in rotation period for smaller bodies with a 3d thermal model may differ from the rubincam s approximation because of the heat flow between adjacent surface pathes that may receive a different mean power flux .",
    "even if the yorp effect occurred to be insensitive to the transverse heat conduction , the 1d models considered in this paper should not be applied to objects whose diameter is small when compared with a skin depth .",
    "this restriction , explicitly stipulated in sect .",
    "[ sect : ppm ] , can be physically explained as follows . consider a bar passing through the centre of a body @xmath296 and intersecting the surface in two antipodal areas @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "the 1d models consider it as two disjoint slabs with the absence of heat conduction at @xmath296 imposed as a boundary condition . in these circumstances ,",
    "even if the conductivity is very high , there is no possibility to transfer the heat from the sunlit @xmath297 to the dark @xmath298 in order to reach a smoother surface temperature distribution and reduce the yorp strength .",
    "a possible improvement of 1d models might be based upon considering the set of antipodal bars without the central cut ; yet , in our opinion , a future investment in a complete 3d model is more needed .    the yorp effect in attitude is not directly observable , but still important for the simulations of long - term spin axis dynamics .",
    "the most prominent example is the analysis of the slivan states in koronis family @xcite , considered the first , indirect proof of the yorp effect existence and significance .",
    "our results indicate that for elliptic orbits there exists a phenomenon that may be called a seasonal yorp effect in attitude by analogy with the seasonal yarkovsky effect in orbital motion @xcite .",
    "the seasonal effect did not appear in earlier works based upon linearized thermal models , which led to a hasty rule that the influence of orbital eccentricity amounts merely to a multiplicative factor from eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) .",
    "we confirm the validity of this rule for the rotation period yorp , but not for the attitude .",
    "the effect passed unnoticed in the model of @xcite , which can probably be explained by its high computational time demands that discouraged experiments with various argument of perihelion values .",
    "the seasonal yorp in attitude deserves a closer inspection within a nonlinear analytical model ( even with a crude insolation model ) that might help to explain its physical meaning .",
    "it is quite possible that there exists some relation between the seasonal yorp and the seversmith psychroterms mechanism discovered by @xcite    as a final remark , let us observe that the presented model can be easily adapted to compute the yarkovsky effect in orbital motion , like in the paper of @xcite .",
