    "in the seminal paper @xcite bell showed that any local realistic theory must satisfy certain conditions known as bell inequalities .",
    "since then numerous bell inequalities have been derived which are characterized by the number of parties , measurement settings and outcomes for each measurement @xcite@xmath1@xcite ( for a review , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of bell inequalities relies on the observation that they can be violated in the quantum mechanical case . due to this property",
    "they can be used for the tests of entanglement and as a basis for protocols in quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "important contribution to the subject has been made by fine @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . basically , his main conclusion was that , given a number of random variables possessing the joint probability distribution , the bell inequalities can be derived from the assumption that the relevant probabilities ( entering the bell inequalities ) are obtained as the marginals from joint probability distribution . what is more important , the bell inequalities provide also the sufficient condition for the existence of joint probability distribution returning the initial probabilities as marginals .",
    "this is crucial observation for understanding the violation of bell inequalities in quantum mechanics . here",
    "the joint probabilities can be constructed only for the sets of mutually commuting observables .",
    "therefore , no bell - type inequality could be derived for joint probabilities of commuting variables if they would follow from the assumption that the relevant probabilities emerge as the marginals of joint distribution for larger set of generally noncommuting variables .",
    "the general scheme for deriving the bell inequalities is now quite simple .",
    "the relevant combination of probabilities is written in terms of marginals of the joint probability distribution ( assumed to exist ) arriving at the expression of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are integers indicating the number of times @xmath4 appears in the sum .",
    "due to @xmath5 , @xmath6 one obtains @xmath7 which is the bell inequality . in order to get the standard form",
    "one should express the probabilities @xmath4 in terms of relevant correlation functions .",
    "+ for example , the celebrated chsh inequality @xcite @xmath8 can be obtained by ( i ) expressing the correlation functions @xmath9 etc . by the probabilities @xmath10 ( ii ) writing the probabilities @xmath10 etc . as the marginals of the joint probability @xmath11 .",
    "note that , on the quantum level , all @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 exist because they correspond to commuting variables while @xmath11 makes no sense .",
    "once the way of deriving the bell inequality for a given combination of probabilities is established one should look for the examples of its quantum mechanical violation .",
    "recently , in two nice papers @xcite , @xcite gney and hillery proposed a method based on group theory .",
    "one takes some finite group @xmath15 and selects its irreducible representation @xmath16 .",
    "the results ( the form of the left hand sides of bell inequalities , the degree of their violation etc . ) will depend on the choice of the group @xmath15 .",
    "given a group @xmath15 one still deals with a number of its irreducible representations .",
    "each representation will , in general , give rise to a different definition of the relevant observables and probabilities entering bell inequalities ; the choice of the representation has an impact on the dimension of quantum state and the number of the outcomes of measurements .",
    "for example , the group @xmath0 we are here interested in , possesses , as explained below , the twodimensional irreducible representation .",
    "it is , however , a homomorphic representation , its kernel being of order four .",
    "in fact , it is the faithful representation of the @xmath17 group which is , in turn , isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath18 .",
    "if we had chosen this representation we would have obtained the results described ( among others ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the threedimensional representation we are going to consider @xmath0 has a transparent geometric interpretation ( as a symmetry of the regular tetrahedron ) which helps greatly to construct the orbits with desired properties ( described below ) .",
    "the space carrying the representation @xmath16 becomes the space of states of one party .",
    "the total space of states describing both parties carries the reducible representation obtained by multiplying @xmath16 by itself .",
    "let @xmath19 be any product state .",
    "one constructs the operator @xmath20 defining the orbits @xmath21 @xmath22 one finds for an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath23 : @xmath24 the sum of probabilities on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) can be easily maximized . to this end",
    "one has to find the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath25 commutes with all @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "assume that in the clebsh - gordon decomposition into irreducible pieces @xmath28 each @xmath29 appears only once .",
    "then , by schur lemma , @xmath25 is automatically diagonal and reduces to a multiple of unity on each irreducible component . using orthogonality relations it is easy to see that the relevant eigenvalues of @xmath25 are @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the order of @xmath15 , @xmath32 is the dimension of @xmath29 representation and @xmath33 is the projection of @xmath34 on to the carrier space of @xmath29 . in general",
    ", one can consider a number of vectors @xmath35 and the corresponding operators @xmath36 .",
    "they mutually commute so the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are simply the sums of the eigenvalues of all @xmath36 . in this way one can maximize the sum of probabilities @xmath38 particularly interesting",
    "situation arises if @xmath39 and @xmath40 are chosen in such a way that the orbits @xmath41 and @xmath42 are decomposed into disjoint sets of mutually orthogonal vectors , each spanning the carrier space of @xmath16 .",
    "any such set can be viewed as defining some observable via its eigenvectors .",
    "in such a case the sum ( [ b ] ) acquires a particularly simple form ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us describe this in more detail .",
    "once the initial vector @xmath43 ( we omit for simplicity the index @xmath44 numbering the orbits ) is selected the size of the orbit @xmath45 is determined by the stabilizer subgroup @xmath46 defined by the condition @xmath47 ; the number of distinct elements of the orbit equals simply @xmath48 .",
    "assume , as indicated above , that the orbit is selected in such a way that it is a collection of disjoint sets of vectors , each set forming an orthonormal basis in the space carrying the representation @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dimension of the representation @xmath16 and @xmath51 . + by assumption @xmath52 however , in general , @xmath53 since each set @xmath54 forms an orthonormal basis one can define the corresponding observables via their spectral decomposition @xmath55 note that @xmath56 can be chosen to be the arbitrary real numbers .",
    "in fact , the bell inequalities concern , in the last instance , the probabilities and their explicit form depends on the choice of @xmath56 only if we express them in terms of correlation functions instead of probabilities themselves .    due to the condition ( [ da ] )",
    "the observables @xmath57 in general do not commute . as a result it makes no sense to speak on the quantum level about their joint probability distribution . on the other hand , by repeating the above reasoning for the orbit @xmath58 one defines the relevant observables @xmath59 for the second party ; @xmath59 s and @xmath60 s commute because they act in different components of the tensor product space so the question of their joint probability makes sense even on quantum level .",
    "( [ b ] ) represents a sum of such probabilities for the system in the state described by @xmath23 . maximizing this expression",
    "can be viewed as looking for cirelson bound @xcite for the specific set of observables defined by the group theoretical methods .",

    "the underlying symmetry of the relevant bell inequalities is that of regular triangle . in the present paper",
    "we consider the bell inequality based on symmetry of regular tetrahedron - the symmetric group @xmath0 .",
    "let us conclude our introduction by writing out explicitly the bell inequality we will be dealing with .",
    "each of two parties , alice and bob , performs the measurements of eight observables @xmath57 , @xmath59 , @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "any observable can take three values , 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "the bell inequality reads    @xmath66    at the quantum level , for a system exhibiting @xmath0 symmetry , the left hand side can attain the value 14,036 .",
    "the symmetric group @xmath0 is of order 24 and possesses 5 conjugacy classes .",
    "there exist five irreducible representations of @xmath0 : trivial representation , the alternating representation , the homomorphic twodimensional one and two threedimensional representations , @xmath16 and @xmath67 ; @xmath67 can be obtained from @xmath16 by multiplication by the alternating representation .",

    "any symmetry operation is the composition of reflections in symmetry planes and rotations around symmetry axes .",
    "for example , the transpositions correspond to reflections in symmetry planes .",
    "one can make the correspondence between the symmetries of tetrahedron and the representation @xmath16 . to this end",
    "it is sufficient to show that there exists an orbit which forms a tetrahedron .",

    "the reason is that the vector @xmath81 we have started with has the stabilizer subgroup consisting of three reflections in the symmetry planes passing through the edges connecting @xmath81 with the remaining vertices ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , d(23 ) mentioned above ) and three rotations around the symmetry axis passing through @xmath81 .",
    "thus we have interpreted the representation of @xmath0 under consideration as the set of symmetry transformations of the tetrahedron .",

    "the degree of violation of the bell inequality on quantum level can be then established using well known methods of group representations theory .",
    "our example is based on specific choice of two orbits .",
    "the question arises how do the results ( i.e. the degree of violation of bell inequality ) depend on the number of orbits considered and their structure ; note that although the orbits are for both parties always the same , we `` shift '' them with respect to each other ( by choosing @xmath43 and @xmath83 as different members of one party orbit ) when constructing the subsequent orbits for the whole system .",
    "in general , the form of bell inequality and degree of its violation depends on : ( i ) the choice of symmetry group @xmath15 ; ( ii ) the choice of irreducible representation(s ) of @xmath15 and ( iii ) the choice of orbit(s ) .",
    "we hope to give more exhaustive analysis elsewhere .",
    "another open problem is whether the group theoretical construction gives the maximal value of violation of bell inequality .",
    "we do not expect this is the case because the quantum system we are considering is special : it exhibits the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the left hand side of bell inequality ( [ w ] ) carries @xmath0 symmetry acting by permuting the probabilities entering the sum ( because the probabilities emerge from the orbit structure ) .",
    "however , it is valid for any set of sixteen observables , each attaining three values . therefore , in looking for cirelson bound one should consider all appropriate quantum systems , not only those carrying @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "our construction can be extended to all platonic solids .",
    "in fact , the symmetry of the cube and octahedron is the direct product of @xmath0 and space inversion while that of dodecahedron and icosahedron - the direct product of alternating group @xmath176 and space inversion .",
    "the platonic solids are the degenerate orbits in appriopriate representations of their symmetry groups and , again , we can use this fact to construct , by means of threedimensional euclidean geometry , the relevant orbits defining the relevant observables .",
    "the bell inequalities considered here are the inequalities of the form @xmath177 where @xmath140 is a certain sum of joint probabilities ( cf .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) ) while @xmath89 is some constant .",
    "as explained in the introduction on the example of chsh inequalities such an inequality can be converted into the standard form involving certain correlation functions . to this end",
    "one should express the relevant probabilities in terms of correlation functions , more or less complicated ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us note that the correlation functions one has to use depend on the dimension of the space of states",
    ". in our case the observables @xmath57 ( or @xmath59 ) obey the third order polynomial equation .",
    "therefore , the independent correlation functions involve the products @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 which allow to express the relevant probabilities in terms of them .",
