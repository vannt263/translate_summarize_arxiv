    "the amount of mass gravitationally accreted to the compact objects such as black holes is determined by the conditions of gas around the compact objects .",
    "the case when gas has a spherically symmetric distribution , a polytropic pressure - density relation , and no angular momentum was solved by bondi ( 1952 ) , who found that the mass accretion rate for the transonic accretion is determined only by the density and the temperature of surrounding gas , both assumed to approach constant values far from the accreting objects .",
    "this rate , known as the bondi accretion rate , is widely used as ` the mass accretion rate ' in a variety of accretion problems . as a function of the density @xmath13 and the isothermal sound speed @xmath14 of gas at infinity ,",
    "the bondi rate for pure hydrogen gas is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 the mass of the central object , and @xmath17 the adiabatic index of accreting gas .",
    "the constant @xmath18 is 0.25 for @xmath19 and 1.12 for @xmath20 .",
    "if we define the bondi radius as @xmath21 , then @xmath22 .",
    "gravity starts to dominate over gas pressure inside the bondi radius and the bondi accretion rate is roughly the mass flux of gas infalling into a sphere of radius @xmath23 with a velocity equal to the sound speed at infinity .",
    "however , many astrophysical accretion flows are expected to have certain amount of angular momentum , and the angular momentum will surely affect the flow properties , including the mass accretion rate . surprisingly , the rate of mass accretion for these rotating , viscous accretion flows for given external boundary conditions , has not been studied yet .",
    "we might expect that if the rotational support is negligible at the bondi radius , the effect of angular momentum to mass accretion rate would be small .",
    "but the accretion rate would diminish as the dimensionless measure of rotation @xmath8 approaches unity , where @xmath9 is the specific angular momentum of gas at the outer boundary and @xmath24 is the representative angular momentum expected at the bondi radius .",
    "although the accretion problem can be reduced to local one in the limit of thin accretion disc where the radial velocity is negligible ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , accretion flow is fundamentally global in the sense that the flow structure is only globally determined .",
    "as pointed out by yuan ( 1999 ) , the flow property can be qualitatively affected by the outer boundary conditions .",
    "the dependence of the mass accretion rate on boundary conditions can only be addressed by constructing global solutions .",
    "there have been many studies on the global solutions of rotating accretion flow ( e.g. , narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ; chen , abramowicz , & lasota 1997 ; nakamura et al .",
    "1997 ; lu , gu , & yuan 1999 ) and the effects of outer boundary conditions on accretion flow ( yuan 1999 ; yuan et al .",
    "2000 ) , but most have focused on the flow structures and emission properties for a given mass accretion rate , and the determination of how that rate is fixed by external circumstances remains to be addressed .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the mass accretion rate of the accretion flow , especially its dependence on the density , temperature , and the angular momentum of gas at the outer boundary .",
    "we do this by constructing the simplest global , transonic solutions within the slim disk formalism ( abramowicz et al .",
    "slim disk formalism uses vertical integration to take into account the finite thickness of the accretion disk , and more importantly allows for the radial motion of the accretion flow and the critical point unlike the thin disk approximation ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "in slim disk approximation , the continuity equation is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radial velocity ( @xmath27 for inflow ) and @xmath28 the density of the flow , both averaged over the height of the disk .",
    "the disk scale height is @xmath29 , where the isothermal sound speed @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the total gas pressure , and @xmath32 the keplerian angular velocity for paczyski - wiita potential ( paczyski & wiita 1980 ) .",
    "this treatment allows for general relativistic effect in an approximate fashion .",
    "we assume that the gas is composed of hydrogen only and is fully ionized .",
    "ions and electrons are assumed to have the same temperature @xmath33 , and hence in this simplified treatment of a pure hydrogen gas , the gas pressure is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the number densities of protons and electrons , respectively , @xmath37 the proton mass , and @xmath38 the boltzmann constant    the radial momentum equation is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angular velocity at radius @xmath41 .",
    "since we adopt paczyski - wiita potential , the keplerian angular velocity is @xmath42^{-2}$ ] where @xmath43 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath44 the speed of light .",
    "the angular momentum equation is given by @xmath45 where the constant @xmath0 is the viscosity parameter of shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) : the viscous stress tensor @xmath46 ( abramowicz et al . 1988 ) .",
    "depending on exactly how the viscosity description is implemented , the parameter @xmath47 can be from @xmath48 ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) , @xmath49 ( nakamura et al . 1997 ) , @xmath50 ( narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ) to @xmath51 ( narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ; yuan 1999 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath49 because this choice simplifies the angular momentum equation into an algebraic one and has an added convenience of automatically satisfying the no - torque condition at the black hole horizon ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 , yuan et al .",
    "2000 ) . on the other hand",
    ", this implementation overestimates the shear stress when there is little or no shear , and can cause difficulties when the solution is extended to a very large radius .",

    "the widely used bondi accretion rate is solely determined by the density and the temperature of accreting gas at infinity . to be more precise however , there is no unique solution for a given density and temperature at infinity : the same boundary condition does allow subsonic ( type i ) , transonic ( type ii ) , and unphysical ( type iii ) solutions with different mass accretion rates ( bondi 1952 ) .",
    "the additional requirement that the flow be transonic , i.e. , regular at the critical point , becomes an additional constraint , which uniquely determines the solution and its accretion rate ( cf .",
    "parker 1963 ) .    in rotating accretion flow",
    ", we expect one more physical quantity to be important : the angular momentum of the gas . in the slim disk formalism ,",
    "the integration constant @xmath52 is an eigenvalue , and only a specific value of @xmath52 for given @xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 admits a regular transonic solution ( muchotrzeb & paczyski 1982 , abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "spherical bondi accretion has a critical point , which prevents the direct integration of the equations from the outer subsonic region to the inner supersonic region .",
    "this difficulty has been handled in two ways : either one starts with an arbitrarily chosen critical radius , integrates both inward and outward with the help of regularity conditions , and adjusts the critical radius until the outer and inner ( if any ) boundary conditions are satisfied ( bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1980 ; quataert & narayan 2000 ) , or one starts with known outer boundary conditions such as density and temperature of gas plus initial choice of radial velocity ( or equally mass accretion rate ) , integrates inward toward the critical point , checks if the velocity suddenly changes sign or diverges , adjusts the velocity ( or the mass accretion rate ) accordingly until the integrated radial velocity behaves normally even very close to the critical radius , extrapolates across the critical point when the adjustment is precise enough , and then integrates from there inward ( park 1990 ) .",
    "this latter iteration procedure has some resemblance to the physical behaviors of the accretion flows .",
    "if the gas at outer boundary starts to accrete with too small velocity ( or mass accretion rate ) than that of the transonic solution , the gas flow stays subsonic all the way , never passing the critical point ( type i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the gas starts to accrete with too large velocity , the velocity of the flow diverges before the critical point and becomes unphysical ( type iii ) .",
    "only when the gas starts to accrete with the just right velocity , or equally mass accretion rate , can the flow pass through the critical point and become steady transonic flow ( type ii ) .",
    "the dynamics of rotating accretion flows are similar except that we must include the added complications due to angular momentum and viscosity .",
    "the flow must have the right mass accretion rate and angular momentum for given density and temperature of gas at the outer boundary to pass through the critical point . to find such regular transonic solution ,",
    "the angular momentum eigenvalue @xmath52 is searched by iteratively integrating the equations , either from the outer boundary ( e.g. , muchotrzeb & paczyski 1982 , abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 , nakamura et al . 1997 ) or from the critical point in and out ( chakrabarti 1996 ; narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ) .",
    "similar procedures are also required to find the subsonic accretion solutions or supersonic solutions with standing shocks onto compact objects with hard surfaces , such as white dwarfs or neutron stars , that satisfy specific outer and inner boundary conditions ( popham & narayan 1991 ; narayan & medvedev 2003 ) .",
    "since we are more interested in the mass accretion rate of the transonic flow for given boundary conditions at large radius , we integrate from the outer boundary inward with the procedure used for spherical accretion as explained above ( park 1990 ) .",
    "the basic parameters , the viscosity parameter @xmath0 and the adiabatic index @xmath17 are chosen first . in this work , we assume @xmath19 and @xmath5 unless noted otherwise .",
    "we then fix the density @xmath75 and the temperature @xmath76 of the gas at the outer boundary @xmath77 .",
    "we also choose an integration constant @xmath52 .",
    "we start to integrate inward by arbitrarily choosing an initial guess for the mass accretion rate @xmath2 , which , along with other conditions , determines the radial velocity @xmath26 from equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) and then the angular velocity @xmath78 at the outer boundary from equation ( [ eq : angular ] ) to enable the initial integration .",
    "the initial guess for @xmath2 produces either a subsonic solution or an unphysical , diverging solution , and integration stops .",
    "we then adjust @xmath2 until the integration can proceed as close to the critical point as possible with a regular velocity profile .",
    "the bifurcation between subsonic and diverging solution is quite sharp , and the iterations can determine @xmath2 up to an arbitrary precision .",
    "once the integration reaches close enough to the critical point , the flow solutions are extrapolated across the critical point to the supersonic region by an appropriate rational function , and the integration ensues from therein .",
    "the interpolation introduces minimal error because the supersonic part of non - transonic flow converges to the transonic flow at smaller radii ( see e.g. , bondi 1952 and das 2007 ) .",
    "since fixing @xmath52 and adjusting @xmath2 is equivalent to fixing @xmath2 and adjusting @xmath52 and the transonic solutions exist only for a rather limited range of @xmath52 , we fix @xmath2 and adjust @xmath52 in most cases",
    ". moreover , equation ( [ eq : angular ] ) relates @xmath52 to the angular momentum at the outer boundary , @xmath9 , and , therefore , adjusting @xmath52 is also equivalent to adjusting @xmath79 . since the reference angular momentum against which @xmath9 needs to be compared is @xmath80 which in fact is the keplerian angular momentum at @xmath81 if @xmath82 , we define a dimensionless angular momentum measure @xmath83 . to summarize ,",
    "we construct a global transonic solution for given @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath84 .",
    "since our integration starts from a finite radius rather than from infinity , we redefine the bondi rate as @xmath85 . with our choice of cooling function",
    ", the whole problem can be put into a dimensionless form , and the result , such as the dimensionless mass accretion rate @xmath86 , is independent of the black hole mass @xmath11 if the density is scaled in units of @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "figure 1 shows typical solutions with different amount of angular momentum : high angular momentum ( solid lines ) , intermediate angular momentum ( dotted lines ) , and low angular momentum ( dashed lines ) . by high angular momentum , we mean @xmath89 , by low angular momentum , @xmath90 , and by the intermediate angular momentum , between the two limits .",
    "the density and the temperature of gas at the outer boundary are the same for the three solutions : @xmath91 and @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",

    "most of the thermal energy is advected with the flow rather than radiated away , and temperature stays close to the virial value .",
    "the flow with high angular momentum becomes supersonic at small radius @xmath100 ( solid line in fig .",
    "1a ) and the angular momentum ( solie line in fig .",
    "1c ) is close to or a few times lower than the keplerian value ( short - long dashed line in fig .",
    "the radial velocity is significant but still smaller than the near free - fall velocity of spherical bondi flow .",
    "this is a typical hot , radiatively inefficient advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) that has been extensively studied ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ; chen , abramowicz , & lasota 1997 ) .",
    "in spherical accretion , the flow passes the critical point at a much larger radius @xmath101 , and the flow becomes supersonic inside @xmath102 .",
    "but in rotating viscous accretion flow , a large part of the flow is subsonic well inside @xmath23 because the rotation of the flow balances out gravity , and the value of @xmath71 depends on the angular momentum of the flow . a low angular momentum flow ( dashed line in fig .",
    "1a ) has a critical point at a much larger radius @xmath103 compared to the high angular momentum one .",
    "it has a larger radial infall velocity at the outer boundary as well because of smaller centrifugal force ( fig .",
    "1b ) , and the mass accretion rate is higher than that of the high angular momentum flow .",
    "these characteristics show that this low angular momentum flow has more resemblance to the spherical flow than to the disk flow as is expected .",
    "this type of flow solution is first discovered by yuan ( 1999 ) and its dynamical and thermal properties have been comprehensibly studied by lu , gu , & yuan ( 1999 ) and yuan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the flow with intermediate angular momentum ( dotted lines ) has a critical point at @xmath104 , and shows intermediate characteristics between the high and low angular momentum flow .",
    "the flow properties change from disklike to quasi - spherical as the angular momentum of the flow decreases .",
    "this is similar to the case of inviscid rotating accretion flow , which becomes disklike or quasi - spherical , depending on the angular momentum ( abramowicz & zurek 1981 ) .",
    "this transition of accretion flow from disklike to quasi - spherical in terms of critical radius position is described in detail by yuan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .      in spherical accretion ,",
    "the outer boundary is naturally selected to be outside the critical point , where the density and the temperature of gas stay roughly constant . in rotating viscous flow , the outer boundary is not naturally associated with the critical point which is at much smaller radius .",
    "so we consider two choices for the outer boundary radius : one at the bondi radius , @xmath105 , for given @xmath76 and the other at a fixed radius regardless of @xmath76 .",
    "the former choice is equivalent to setting the outer boundary at a virial temperature if we define the virial temperature as @xmath106 .",
    "while original bondi solutions are expressed in terms of the density and temperature of gas at infinity , our solutions start at a finite radius .",
    "but since the density and temperature of gas vary little from infinity to the bondi radius in the bondi solutions , we compare our solutions for given density and temperature of gas at finite @xmath77 against the bondi solutions with the same density and temperature at infinity .",
    "we first discuss the case where the outer boundary is set to be the bondi radius , @xmath107 for given @xmath76 , so that the solutions can be meaningfully compared with the bondi solutions .",
    "the density at the outer boundary is either @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "since the whole set of equations can be rescaled in density except the cooling function @xmath110 , the mass accretion rate then is simply proportional to @xmath75 when cooling is not important . in such case",
    ", the flow profile depends only on @xmath111 and not on the specific value of @xmath75 .",
    "however , as the mass accretion rate @xmath112 approaches 0.1 times the eddington mass accretion rate , @xmath113 , cooling becomes important as in spherical accretion ( park 1990 ) .",
    "in such high @xmath114 case , the existence and the properties of the flow depend on the specific value of @xmath115 .",
    "figure 2 shows the mass accretion rate of constructed solutions as a function of the angular momentum at the outer boundary , in @xmath116 versus @xmath84 plane .",
    "symbols represent the solutions for different @xmath76 : circles for @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , triangles for @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , squares for @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , pentagons for @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) , and hexagons for @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "all these solutions are calculated for @xmath108 .",
    "the solutions for @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) , temperature suitable for the ism in a galactic nucleus , have much larger @xmath77 , and the bifurcation between subsonic to unphysical branch becomes even sharper . since the critical mass accretion rate above which the hot , optically thin accretion disk does not exist also decreases as @xmath77 increases ( abramowicz et al . 1995 ) and the bondi rate increases as @xmath76 decreases , we choose @xmath129 so that @xmath130 is in a range where solutions can be found .",
    "the mass accretion rates of these solutions are shown as crosses in the center of figure 2 .",
    "we find that regardless of @xmath76 , the mass accretion rate @xmath116 decreases as the angular momentum @xmath84 increases .",
    "it approaches the bondi accretion rate as @xmath84 decreases .",
    "this change of the mass accretion rate on the angular momentum is expected because given density and temperature at @xmath77 , @xmath28 and @xmath131 are fixed in the continuity equation ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : continuity ] ] ) , and the mass accretion rate is determined solely by the radial velocity @xmath26 . from equation ( [ eq : radial ] ) , the radial velocity is determined by the difference between the gravity and the centrifugal accleration which is proportional to @xmath132 ( at @xmath133 ) .",
    "larger angular momentum causes smaller infall velocity , and the mass accretion rate decreases , and vice versa .",
    "the mass accretion rate for the lowest angular momentum flow is quite close to the bondi rate ( @xmath134 ) while that for the highest angular momentum flow is roughly 20 times smaller than the corresponding bondi rate ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "we also find that @xmath116 as a function of @xmath84 is rather insensitive to @xmath76 , or equally @xmath77 for @xmath136 : the slope of @xmath137 has a tendency to become slightly flatter ( from circles to crosses ) as @xmath76 decreases but the difference is not large .",
    "since we expect the flow profile , especially the radial velocity , to depend on the specific value of @xmath0 , we also calculate the solutions for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the mass accretion rates of @xmath138 are shown as a series of stars in the left side of figure 2 and that of @xmath139 are shown in the right side of of figure 2 .",
    "compared to the solutions for @xmath5 in the center denoted by crosses , lower @xmath0 flows have smaller mass accretion rate and higher @xmath0 flows larger mass accretion rate .",
    "larger @xmath0 means stronger viscosity for given density and temperature , which causes larger radial velocity , and hence larger mass accretion rate , and vice versa for smaller @xmath0 .",
    "the relation between @xmath140 and @xmath84 for @xmath141 can be approximated by @xmath142 the three straight lines ( from left to right ) in figure 2 show this fitting function for @xmath138 , 0.01 , and 0.03 , respectively .",
    "the mass accretion rate of the self - similar adaf that has density @xmath75 at @xmath77 has the same dependency on @xmath75 and @xmath77 as the bondi rate @xmath143 ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "hence , the dimensionless mass accretion rate of self - similar adaf is simply @xmath144 .",
    "since adaf generally refers to @xmath145 flow and @xmath146 , we find that our solutions have approximately three times higher mass accretion rates than those of self - similar adafs .",
    "the difference is probably due to the fact that the density and velocity of global adafs do not exactly follow the self - similar form , especially near the outer boundary ( narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ; chen , abramowicz , & lasota 1997 ) .",
    "for given @xmath76 , the lower limit on the mass accretion rate is determined by the keplerian angular momentum barrier . a smaller mass accretion rate demands smaller radial infall velocity . from equation ( [ eq : angular ] ) , smaller @xmath147 requires larger @xmath78 , and eventually @xmath78 becomes larger than the keplerian value @xmath32 at @xmath77 for too small mass accretion rate .",
    "gas can not accrete in steady - state when the angular momentum is much larger than the keplerian one , and therefore no solution exists when @xmath148 . although we could determine @xmath111 below @xmath149 from shooting until @xmath84 approaches @xmath150 or 3 , in many cases we failed to construct the full transonic solutions down to the inner boundary .",
    "the difficulty is much more severe for small @xmath0 : the bifurcation between subsonic and unphysical occurs at a large radius and computing accuracy is not enough to integrate all the way down to the horizon .",
    "so we have limited confidence in the solutions below @xmath151 for @xmath152 and 0.03 .",
    "the upper limit on the mass accretion rate on the other hand is determined by the bondi accretion rate itself .",
    "the lowest angular momentum flow has its mass accretion rate already quite close to the bondi rate , which is the mass accretion rate for zero angular momentum flow .",
    "thus any higher mass accretion flow will end up on the unphysical branch of solutions in spherical bondi flow ( type iii ) , with minimum effect due to the angular momentum .",
    "we can think of extending the velocity versus radius diagram of bondi ( 1952 ) to a similar one with the angular momentum effect added .",
    "what angular momentum does is to lower the critical mass accretion rate for the transonic flow . as the angular momentum of the flow increases , the critical mass accretion rate decreases , and the rotating accretion flow accretes transonically at a critical mass accretion rate lower than the original bondi accretion rate . on the other hand , if the angular momentum of the flow decreases , the critical mass accretion rate increases up to the bondi accretion rate which is the critical mass accretion rate for zero angular momentum flow , above which no transonic steady - state rotating accretion flow exists .",
    "since equation ( [ eq : mdot_mb ] ) gives @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath116 can not be greater than unity , it looks like there is no solution for @xmath154 . however , we are using slim disk formulation with a simple viscosity prescription to describe what is really a two - dimensional quasi - spherical flow , especially for lowest angular momentum flow ; so the non - existence of solutions below the lower limit on @xmath84 is probably caused by the approximate physical descriptions of the flow , especially the overestimated viscosity for the low or no angular momentum flow .",
    "surely , we will have a spherical bondi flow when the angular momentum is zero .",
    "therefore , we expect that steady flow probably exists even below @xmath155 and @xmath156 we conclude that the steady - state , transonic hot accretion flow exists only when the mass accretion rate is within a certain range or the angular momentum at the outer boundary is below a certain maximum value . for our specific choice of parameters and conditions ,",
    "the range in the mass accretion rate is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the mass accretion rate of the flow with maximum possible angular momentum at the outer boundary .",
    "our calculations suggest @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "now we discuss flows with the outer boundary temperature different from the virial temperature .",
    "for example , when the cool , outer geometrically thin disk is attached to the hot inner accretion disk , the temperature at the outer boundary will be much lower than the virial temperature ( narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ) .",
    "so we fix @xmath162 but vary @xmath76 .",
    "the outer boundary density is the same at @xmath163 .",
    "figure 3 shows the mass accretion rate again in @xmath116 versus @xmath84 plane .",
    "symbols are the same as in figure 2 , except circles for @xmath164 , triangles for @xmath165 , squares for @xmath123 , pentagons for @xmath125 , and hexagons for @xmath166 .",
    "again , solutions exist only in a limited range of @xmath116 , or equally @xmath84 . but this time both upper and lower limits on @xmath116 vary with @xmath76 .",
    "the reason for the difference is that @xmath77 is fixed and not related to @xmath76 whereas it is related to @xmath76 in bondi solutions . as in previous choice of boundary ,",
    "the lower limit on @xmath116 is from the keplerian angular momentum barrier .",
    "however , the upper limit is determined for a different reason in this case .",
    "as the mass accretion rate for given boundary conditions increases , the radial infall velocity at the outer boundary should increase .",
    "but the increasing radial infall velocity eventually becomes larger than the sound speed at the boundary .",
    "the whole flow becomes supersonic from the outer boundary to the innermost radius .",
    "since we are looking for transonic solutions that uniquely determine the mass accretion rate , we disregard these supersonic branch of solutions , and no transonic solutions exist above certain upper limit on @xmath116 .",
    "this upper limit on @xmath116 decreases as @xmath76 decreases because the sound speed decreases with @xmath76 and the flow becomes supersonic at smaller radial velocity , or mass accretion rate , causing rapid decrease of the upper limit on @xmath116 with decreasing @xmath76 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath116 on @xmath84 is also different .",
    "again , @xmath116 decreases as @xmath84 increases , but is not inversely proportional to @xmath84 , nor is independent of @xmath76 .",
    "cooler flow , i.e. , lower @xmath76 , has lower mass accretion rate @xmath116 for a given @xmath84 . when @xmath167 , @xmath116 for @xmath165 is @xmath168 while that for @xmath166 is as low as @xmath169 .",
    "this means that if gas is injected into a given radius with near - keplerian angular momentum but with temperature much below the virial temperature at that radius , the mass accretion rate can be a few orders of magnitude below the bondi accretion rate .",
    "we have constructed global solutions of the rotating , viscous accretion flow within the framework of height - averaged , slim @xmath0 disk with varying amount of specific angular momentum @xmath84 at the outer boundary .",
    "we find that the low angular momentum flow , the flow with @xmath90 , resembles the spherical bondi flow and its mass accretion rate approaches the bondi accretion rate for the same density and temperature at the outer boundary .",
    "the high angular momentum flow , the flow with @xmath89 , on the other hand is the conventional hot accretion disk with advection , but its mass accretion rate can be significantly smaller than the bondi accretion rate for the same density and temperature at the outer boundary .",
    "we also find that solutions exist only within a limited range of the dimensionless mass accretion rate @xmath116 , the mass accretion rate in units of the bondi accretion rate .",
    "when the temperature at the outer boundary is equal to the virial temperature at that radius , solutions exist only when @xmath170 because below @xmath171 the angular momentum of the flow becomes higher than the keplerian value , and the steady accretion is not possible .",
    "the exact value of @xmath171 as a function of the viscosity parameter @xmath0 is not known , but is @xmath172 for @xmath161 .",
    "the upper limit on the mass accretion rate is the bondi accretion rate since it is the mass accretion rate of zero angular momentum flow .",
    "moreover , we also find that the dimensionless mass accretion rate is roughly independent of the radius of the outer boundary but inversely proportional to the angular momentum at the outer boundary in units of the keplerian angular momentum at that same radius and proportional to the viscosity parameter , @xmath6 when @xmath141 .",
    "when the temperature at the outer boundary is much less than the virial temperature , the mass accretion rate can be a few orders of magnitude smaller than the bondi accretion rate .",
    "the fact that the mass accretion rate can be smaller than the bondi accretion rate and depends on the angular momentum of gas at the outer boundary could have interesting implications for many astrophysical accretion systems , especially underluminous agns and galactic centers .",
    "although we now have a better understanding of the behavior of rotating , viscous accretion flows with varying amount of angular momentum , the precise numerical values presented in this work are expected to contain some uncertainties because these hot accretion flows are certain to have real two - dimensional structures , and the one - dimensional , height - averaged approximation adopted in this work will only approximately describe the real flow .",
    "hence , more precise analyses of these accretion flow including other relevant physics such as shocks ( chakrabarti & das 2004 ) , outflows ( stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ) , or radiative heating ( park & ostriker 1999 , 2001 , 2007 ; yuan , xie & ostriker 2009 ; proga , ostriker , & kurosawa 2008 ) will require careful multi - dimensional studies ( see e.g. proga 2007 , kurosawa & proga 2008 , and proga , ostriker , & kurosawa 2008 for current multi - dimensional studies ) .",
    "we thank jerry ostriker for many insightful discussions and careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also thank the referee , ramesh narayan , for useful comments which significantly improved this paper .",
