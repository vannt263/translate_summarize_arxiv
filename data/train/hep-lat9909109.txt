    "in recent years there has been tremendous progress in the computation of baryon masses within lattice qcd .",
    "still , it remains necessary to extrapolate the calculated results to the physical pion mass ( @xmath0 mev ) in order to make a comparison with experimental data . in doing",
    "so one necessarily encounters some non - linearity in the quark mass ( or @xmath1 ) , including the non - analytic behavior associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we recently investigated this problem for the case of the nucleon magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "it is vital to develop a sound understanding of how to extrapolate to the physical pion mass .",
    "chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in qcd and the pion alone is a near goldstone boson .",
    "it is strongly coupled to baryons and plays a significant role in @xmath2 and @xmath3 self - energies .",
    "the one - loop pion induced self - energies of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given by the processes shown in fig .",
    "[ se - fig ] .    in the standard heavy baryon limit ,",
    "the analytic expression for the pion cloud correction to the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are of the form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 here @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the axial charge of the nucleon , @xmath10 is the pion energy and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 form factors associated with the emission of a pion of three - momentum @xmath16 .",
    "the form factors reflect the finite size of the baryonic source of the pion field and suppress the emission probability at high virtual pion momentum . as a result",
    ", the self - energy integrals are not divergent .",
    "the leading non - analytic ( lna ) contribution of these self - energy diagrams is associated with the infrared behavior of the corresponding integrals ; i.e.  the behavior as @xmath17 . as a consequence ,",
    "the leading non - analytic behavior does not depend on the details of the form factors .",
    "indeed , the well known results of chiral perturbation theory @xcite are reproduced even when the form factors are approximated by @xmath18 .    of course , our concern with respect to lattice qcd is not so much the behavior as @xmath19 , but the extrapolation from high pion masses to the physical pion mass . in this context",
    "the branch point at @xmath20 , associated with transitions of @xmath21 or @xmath22 , is at least as important as the lna behavior near @xmath23 .",
    "heavy quark effective theory suggests that as @xmath24 the quarks become static and hadron masses become proportional to the quark mass . in this spirit",
    ", corrections are expected to be of order @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "the presence of a cut - off associated with the form factor acts to suppress the pion induced self energy for increasing pion masses , as evidenced by the @xmath1 in the denominators of eqs .",
    "( [ se - nn - integral - eqn ] ) , ( [ se - nd - integral - eqn ] ) and ( [ se - dn - integral - eqn ] ) . while some @xmath1 dependence in the form factor is expected , this is a second - order effect and does not alter the qualitative feature of the self - energy corrections tending to zero as @xmath27 in the heavy quark limit .    rather than simplifying our expressions to just the lna terms",
    ", we retain the complete expressions @xcite , as they contain important physics that would be lost by making a simplification .",
    "we note that keeping the entire form is not in contradiction with @xmath28pt .",
    "however , as one proceeds to larger quark masses , differences between the full forms and the expressions in the chiral limit will become apparent , highlighting the importance of the branch point and the form factor reflecting the finite size of baryons .    as a result of these considerations ,",
    "we propose to use the analytic expressions for the self - energy integrals corresponding to a sharp cut - off in order to incorporate the correct lna structure in a simple three - parameter description of the @xmath29 dependence of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses . in the heavy quark limit",
    "hadron masses become proportional to the quark mass .",
    "hence we can simulate a linear dependence of the baryon masses on the quark mass , @xmath30 , in this region , by adding a term involving @xmath31 .",
    "the functional form for the mass of the nucleon suggested by this analysis is then : @xmath32 while that for the @xmath3 is : @xmath33      the use of a sharp cut - off , @xmath18 , as a form factor may seem somewhat unfortunate given that phenomenology suggests a dipole form factor better approximates the axial - vector form factor .",
    "however , the sensitivity to such model - dependent issues is shown to be negligible in fig .",
    "[ se - fit ] .",
    "there , the self - energy contribution @xmath34 for a 1 gev dipole form factor ( solid curve ) is compared with a sharp cut - off form factor combined with the standard @xmath35 terms of ( [ n - form - eqn ] ) or ( [ d - form - eqn ] ) .",
    "optimizing @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 provides the fine - dash curve of fig .  [ se - fit ] .",
    "differences are at the few mev level indicating negligible sensitivity to the actual analytic structure of the form factor .    here",
    "we have focused on the pion self - energy contribution to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 form factors .",
    "only the pion displays a rapid mass dependence as the chiral limit is approached .",
    "other mesons participating in similar diagrams do not give rise to such rapidly changing behavior and can be accommodated in the @xmath35 terms of ( [ n - form - eqn ] ) or ( [ d - form - eqn ] ) . moreover",
    ", the form factor suppresses the contributions from more massive intermediate states including multiple pion dressings .",
    "other multi - loop pion contributions renormalize the vertex and hence we use the renormalized coupling @xmath39 as a measure of the pion - nucleon coupling .",
    "we consider two independent dynamical - fermion lattice simulations of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses .",
    "we select results from cp - pacs s @xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41 simulations at @xmath42 , and ukqcd s @xcite @xmath43 simulations at @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ 3fits - n - fig ] displays fits of ( [ n - form - eqn ] ) to the lattice data . in order to perform fits in which @xmath36 is unconstrained",
    ", it is essential to have lattice simulations at light quark masses approaching @xmath45 gev@xmath46 .",
    "it is common to see the use of the following @xmath28pt - motivated expression for the mass dependence of hadron masses , @xmath47 the result of such a fit for the @xmath2 is shown as the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ 3fits - n - fig ] .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath48 term in a three parameter fit is @xmath49 .",
    "this disagrees with the coefficient of @xmath50 known from @xmath28pt ( which is correctly incorporated in ( [ n - form - eqn ] ) and illustrated as the solid and dash - dot curves of fig .",
    "[ 3fits - n - fig ] ) by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this clearly indicates the failings of ( [ naive - eqn ] ) .    the dotted curve of fig .",
    "[ 3fits - n - fig ] indicates the leading non - analytic term of the chiral expansion dominates from the chiral limit up to the branch point at @xmath51 mev , beyond which @xmath28pt breaks down .",
    "the curvature around @xmath52 , neglected in previous extrapolations of the lattice data , leads to shifts in the extrapolated masses of the same order as the departure of lattice estimates from experimental measurements ."
