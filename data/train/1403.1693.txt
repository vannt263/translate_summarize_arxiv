    "@xcite discovered that the universe is expanding by finding a correlation between a galaxy s recession velocity and its distance .",
    "since then , a reliable estimate of the expansion rate of the universe at the current epoch has been a central subject in observational cosmology .",
    "this expansion rate is denoted by the hubble constant , @xmath2 , and it characterizes the nature of the universe , such as the age of the universe , @xmath6 , the observable size of the universe , @xmath7 , and the critical mass density of the universe , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the speed of light , and @xmath10 is the gravitational constant .    a variety of empirical distance - ladder methods have been proposed , which determine the distance to a galaxy through a series of steps , with each step calibrating the next more distant step , such as those with final steps based upon the period ",
    "luminosity relation for cepheid variable stars , the maximum luminosity of type ia supernovae , etc .",
    "the results from these empirical methods have almost converged to a value of @xmath2 at around 73 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "a physical method has the advantage over the empirical methods in that it could , in principle , determine @xmath2 through a reasonable model parameterization without resorting to an empirical distance ladder . the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect @xcite and the use of gravitational lensing @xcite have been proposed .",
    "however , their results for @xmath2 have not converged to agree with those from the empirical methods , because uncertainties associated with parameters in these particular methods do not allow an accuracy comparable to the empirical methods @xcite .",
    "consequently , other physical methods that enable the measurement of extragalactic distances with higher accuracy are eagerly sought .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a new physical method , using a model with simple physics , for extragalactic distance determination .",
    "our model is based on the dust reverberation in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by determining @xmath2 with a value and accuracy comparable to that obtained by the hubble key project using cepheid variable stars .",
    "an agn consists of a hot central engine surrounded by a cooler dust torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust near the central engine is sublimated , creating a gap between the central engine and the inner radius of the torus .",
    "dust grains beyond the sublimation radius , @xmath11 , absorb short wavelength light produced by the central engine , and re - emit the absorbed energy at long wavelengths .",
    "variations in the flux emitted by the central engine are mimicked at long wavelengths by the dust torus after a time delay , @xmath12 , corresponding to the light travel time between the central engine and the inner radius of the dust torus .",
    "apparently , @xmath11 is determined by the absolute luminosity , @xmath13 , of the central engine according to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "thus , by measuring the time delay , @xmath15 , we can obtain the absolute luminosity of the agn , and its distance .",
    "we assume local energy balance between the absorbed short wavelength ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation and the re - emitted long wavelength near - infrared ( nir ) radiation at the inner radius of the dust torus : @xmath16 where @xmath17 in the uv to optical region with the power - law index @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the absolute luminosity in the @xmath20-band , @xmath21 is the plank function for the characteristic dust sublimation temperature @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the absorption coefficient per dust grain of mean radius @xmath24 as a function of @xmath25 taken from literature @xcite .",
    "values of the three parameters , @xmath18 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 , are set using observations of agn .",
    "we have @xmath26 taken from a composite qso spectrum @xcite .",
    "we adopt a rather large uncertainty of @xmath27 which well covers the observed range of qso to qso spectral index variation . with this @xmath28 , we truncate the uv spectrum at @xmath29 @xmath30 m , considering the uv turnover of qso spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the decrease of dust absorption efficiency at shorter wavelength below this truncation @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath31 k evaluated from the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 color temperatures of the variable nir component for a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies observed with the magnum telescope @xcite .",
    "is evaluated from the nir color temperatures of the variable component rather than the average or single - epoch nir spectral energy distributions of the whole component which contains the contribution from the dust of lower temperatures at larger radii beyond @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "agns in our sample show no burst - like flux variation but repeat the brighter and fainter states in turn ( figure 1 ) , keeping their nir colors almost constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dust temperature of the variable component is regarded as staying almost constant during the flux variation .",
    "note that the color temperatures can be determined without subtracting the host - galaxy flux , which would often be an origin of large uncertainty . ]",
    "the value for @xmath22 is consistent with the condensation temperature for solid carbon @xcite . since dust grains other than graphite grains sublimate below this temperature , the absorption coefficient of graphite grains is adopted for @xmath23 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath24 is assumed to have a power - law form of @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 m , and @xmath38 m ( cf .",
    "the mean grain size for this distribution is larger than that in the interstellar medium , based on the analysis of uv extinction curves of radio - quiet agns @xcite .",

    "the @xmath4 figures given for @xmath62 in table 1 represent the uncertainty in the flow models and are half the difference between the correction to @xmath62 obtained from the two models .",
    "in figure 2 , we present the velocity - distance diagram to compare the extragalactic distances measured using our agn time - lag method with distances obtained from cepheid variable stars . our agn time - lag method determines the distance , @xmath53 , through a reasonable physical parameterization , and directly provides the first step in the distance ladder .",
    "we obtain the hubble constant , @xmath64 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 from a least squares fit to @xmath65 using our agn time - lag distances . the hubble constant found from empirically calibrated cepheid distances",
    "is @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "our agn time - lag method , which is based upon a physical model with no empirical calibration , agrees well with the cepheid distances and other empirical distance ladders @xcite , but extends to galaxies 10 times more distant than where cepheid distances can be measured , to where the cosmic recession velocity is not so badly afflicted by the local velocity flow .",
    "the systematic error in @xmath2 is estimated by changing the parameter values of @xmath28 and @xmath22 in their respective ranges of uncertainty , and by changing the distribution of @xmath24 , assumed to have a power - law form of @xmath35 .",
    "our calculation gives @xmath67 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and @xmath68 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 for the uncertainty in @xmath28 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the systematic error in @xmath2 from the uncertainty in @xmath69 is estimated using two extreme size distributions , such as the standard `` mrn '' distribution in the local interstellar medium for our galaxy ( @xmath70 , @xmath37 m , @xmath71 m ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the larger grain enhanced distribution for agns ( @xmath72 , @xmath37 m , @xmath38 m ) , because smaller dust grains are more efficiently sublimated by uv radiation from the central engine @xcite . we adopt an intermediate value of @xmath36 with @xmath37 m and @xmath38 m as our standard grain size distribution .",
    "nir flux - weighted averaging scheme over the full range of @xmath24 is then applied to equation ( 1 ) , and the calibration factor @xmath58 is calculated for the two extreme distributions as well as the intermediate one .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath58 is within the limits of @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 is at most @xmath75 dex from equation ( 2 ) , which is currently the largest source of the systematic error in @xmath2 .",
    "this error in @xmath2 is much reduced for a sample of agns for which their @xmath28 , @xmath22 , and @xmath69 are individually measured , because the target to target variation of these parameters also contributes to the random error in the @xmath2 fitting . in particular ,",
    "if monitoring observations of high - redshift agns were obtained , their uv  optical spectrum could be determined directly from ground based spectroscopic observations , and the accuracy of the @xmath2 determination would be significantly improved .",
    "alternatively , if many of target agns were calibrated by other reliable distance indicators such as cepheids and type ia supernovae , their calibrated distances would not only provide a cross check on our method of distance determination , but also independently constrain the parameter values in a physical model of dust reverberation .",
    "two other reverberation methods of distance determination of agn have been proposed .",
    "one is a method based on the reverberation mapping of the broad line emitting region ( blr ) in agn @xcite , using an empirical relation between the radial distance of blr from the agn center and the agn luminosity .",
    "although the radius - luminosity relation of blr is well established now @xcite , the exact size of blr can not be predicted theoretically .",
    "therefore , this method remains as an empirical method in the sense that it must use empirical distance - ladder methods for calibration .",
    "another is a method based on the wavelength - dependent time delay of uv  optical continuum emission from the central accretion disk in agn @xcite .",
    "this method is a physical one , like our method , which could , in principle , determine the distance without any distance calibration .",
    "however , this method gives @xmath764244 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , which is about a factor of 1.7 smaller than current standard estimates , and even below the recent lower estimate of 67 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 based on planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , this method seems to have some difficulties to be resolved , such as the adequacy of modeling the x - ray reprocessing for the flux variation of uv  optical continuum emission .",
    "in fact , while some agns show a delay of the optical flux variation behind that of x - ray , which is consistent with the x - ray reprocessing , some others show a delay of the x - ray variation behind that of optical , or they show a poor correlation between the x - ray and optical variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that our agn time - lag method can be used to measure extragalactic distances beyond what is possible with cepheids , and we have obtained a value of the hubble constant with our agn time - lag method of @xmath77 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 for a sample of 17 seyfert 1 galaxies observed with the magnum telescope .",
    "we suggest that this method can be used with qsos to study the dark energy in the universe beyond what is possible with type ia supernovae .",
    "we thank the staff at the haleakala observatories for their help with facility maintenance .",
