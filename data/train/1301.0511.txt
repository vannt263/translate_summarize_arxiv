    "asymptotic studies of measures on partitions of representation theoretic origin is a well - known and popular subject .",
    "in addition to its intrinsic importance in representation theory , see e.g. @xcite and references therein , it enjoys close connections to the theory of random matrices , interacting particle systems , enumerative combinatorics , and other domains , for which it often provides crucial technical tools , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a typical scenario of how such measures arise is as follows : one starts with a group that has a well known list of irreducible representations , often parametrized by partitions or related objects .",
    "then a decomposition of a natural reducible representation of this group on irreducibles provides a split of the total dimension of the representation space into dimensions of the corresponding isotypical components ; their relative sizes are the weights of the measure .",
    "this procedure is well - defined for finite - dimensional representations , but also for infinite - dimensional representations with finite trace ; the weight of ( the label of ) an isotypical component is then defined as the trace of the projection operator onto it , provided that the trace is normalized to be equal to 1 on the identity operator .",
    "an alternative approach to measures of this sort consists in defining averages with respect to such a measure for a suitable set of functions on labels of the irreducible representations .",
    "these averages are obtained as traces of the operators in the ambient representation space that are scalar in each of the isotypical components . in their turn , the operators are images of central elements in the group algebra of the group if the group is finite , or in the universal enveloping algebra of the lie algebra if one deals with a lie group .",
    "the central elements form a commutative algebra that is being mapped to the algebra of functions on the labels , i.e. , on partitions or their relatives .",
    "the value of the function corresponding to a central element at a representation label is the ( scalar ) value of this element in that representation .",
    "while one may be perfectly satisfied with such an approach from the probabilistic point of view , from the representation theoretic point of view it is somewhat unsettling that we are able to only deal with commutative subalgebras this way , while the main interest of representation theory is in noncommutative effects .",
    "the goal of this work is go beyond this commutativity constraint .",
    "more exactly , in a specific setting of the finite trace representations of the infinite - dimensional unitary group @xmath0 described below , we consider a family of commutative subalgebras of the universal enveloping algebra such that elements from different subalgebras generally speaking do not commute .",
    "we further consider the limit regime in which the measures for each of the commutative subalgebras are known to approximate the two - dimensional gaussian free field ( gff ) , see @xcite .",
    "we want to study the `` joint distribution '' of these gffs for different subalgebras , whatever this might mean .    for any element of the universal enveloping algebra",
    ", one can define its `` average '' as the trace of its image in the representation .",
    "thus , having a representation , we can define `` averages '' for arbitrary products of elements from our subalgebras , despite the fact that the elements do not commute .",
    "our main result ( fully stated in section [ sc : mainresult ] below ) is that for certain _ plancherel _ representations , these `` averages '' converge to actual averages of suitable observables on a gaussian process that consists of a family of explicitly correlated gffs .",
    "thus , the original absence of commutativity in this limit disappears , and yet the limiting gffs that arise from different commutative subalgebras do not become independent .    the same limiting object ( the collection of correlated gffs ) has been previously shown to be the universal global scaling limit for eigenvalues of various submatrices of wigner hermitian random matrices , cf .",
    ". we also expect it to arise from other , non - plancherel factor representations of the infinite - dimensional unitary group under appropriate limit transitions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ sc : preliminaries ]",
    "we give necessary definitions and collect a few known facts on asymptotics of the plancherel measures for @xmath0 . section [ sc : statement ] contains the statement of our main result . in section [ sc : covariance ] we show how one obtains the variance of the limiting gaussian process .",
    "the final section [ sc : proof ] contains a proof of the asymptotic normality of the chosen `` observables '' .",
