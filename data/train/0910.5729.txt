    "the massive black holes ( mbhs ) that we observe today in local spheroids ( ferrarese & ford 2005 , and references therein ) are expected to have grown through a series of major accretion episodes in symbiosis with the growth of their host galaxies .",
    "gas - rich major mergers may be at the heart of this joint evolution as they may explain the morphology of the hosts and at the same time account for the fueling of the underlying mbhs ( e.g. di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "in the currently favored cold dark matter hierarchical cosmologies , galaxy mergers play indeed a key role in growing galaxies to their present sizes and the coalescence of mbhs in binaries is therefore expected to be relatively common ( menou , haiman & narayanan 2001 ; volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ) .    following a galaxy major merger",
    ", the pair of mbhs first interacts with stars ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ; milosavljevic & merritt 2001 ) and gas ( mayer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the pair loses orbital angular momentum , and it is expected to harden progressively down to subparsec scales where emission of gravitational radiation drives the mbh inspiral down to coalescence . depending on the properties of the coalescing binary ,",
    "the pattern of the gravitational wave emission can be anisotropic , resulting in a non zero recoil velocity ( a `` kick '' ) of the mbh remnant ( redmount & rees 1989 ) .",
    "several attempts to compute analytically the strength of the kick have been undertaken ( peres 1962 ; bekenstein 1973 ; fitchett 1983 ; fitchett & detweiler 1984 ; redmount & rees 1989 ; wiseman 1992 ; favata , hughes & holz 2004 ; blanchet , qusailah & will 2005 ; damour & gopakumar 2006 ; schnittman & buonanno 2007 .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the coalescence of spinning mbhs in full general relativity have been able to calculate explicitly kick velocities for a series of different binary configurations .",
    "it is found that three parameters influence the magnitude of the gravitational recoil of the relic mbh : the binary mass ratio , the spins , and the mutual orientation of the spins with respect to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the recoil is largest , up to @xmath4 , for nearly equal mass mbhs with large spins , when the spin vectors have opposite directions and are in the orbital plane ( campanelli et al . 2007 ) .",
    "by contrast , recoils of @xmath5 are imparted to the mbh remnant if the spins of the progenitors prior coalescence are orthogonal to their orbital plane .",
    "purely general relativistic ( gr ) effects ( i.e. , spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions ) may produce low recoil configurations , when the mbh pairing is driven by gravitational wave emission .",
    "however , those gr effects depend strongly on the initial relative orientation of the mbh spins , and can result in low recoil configurations only for a small region of parameter space ( schnittman 2004 ; herrmann et al . 2009 ; lousto et al . 2009 ) .    in gas - rich mergers between galaxies of comparable mass ( i.e. major mergers ) , close binary mbhs form under the action of dynamical friction against the gaseous and stellar background ( mayer et al . 2007 ; callegari et al . 2009",
    "; see colpi & dotti 2009 for a review ) . during their inspiral mbhs",
    "are surrounded by a dense cocoon of gas that drives their dynamical decay and provides fuel for the feeding of the holes ( dotti et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "since matter carries angular momentum also the spin vector can change during the accretion process .",
    "the details of the dynamics may have a profound influence on the mass and spin evolution of the two mbhs , and thus on the recoil velocity of the mbh resulting from their coalescence , and this is matter of our concern in this paper .",
    "the spin evolution during the mbh inspiral in a gas rich merger remnant has many implications .",
    "spins , prior to coalescence , influence the extent of the gravitational recoil , and so the retention of the relic mbh inside its host galaxy .",
    "accordingly , the spin distribution of the coalescing binaries , is critical as it determines the frequency of mbh retention in the host halo ( volonteri & rees 2006 ; volonteri 2007 ; volonteri , haardt & gultekin 2008 ; gultekin et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the magnitude of the mbh spins and their orientation relative to the orbit during mergers is also critical in shaping the stellar density profiles in ellipticals , as the kicked mbh moving on a return orbit can deposit its excess kinetic energy into the stellar background , causing the formation of stellar core ( boylan  kolchin , ma & quataert 2004 ; gualandris & merritt 2008 )",
    ". a recoiling mbh can have an observational signature when moving across the host galaxy , creating an x - ray tail in the perturbed hot gas ( devecchi et al .",
    "2009 ) , an off - set active nucleus ( loeb 2007 ; volonteri & madau 2008 ) , shocking the inner rim of the accretion disc ( lippai , frei & haiman 2008 ; schnittman & krolik 2008 ) , or dragging a stellar cusp with peculiarly high velocity dispersion ( merritt , schnittman & komossa 2009 ) .",
    "furthermore , spin orientations have important implications for gravitational wave astronomy , and for using gravitational wave measurements to constrain the formation history of mbhs ( vecchio 2004 ; lang & hughes 2006 ; berti & volonteri 2008 ; arun et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) .",
    "bogdanovic , reynolds & miller ( 2007 ) proposed a physical process that could _ align _ the mbh spins with the orbital angular momentum of the binary , thus leading to slow recoils for the mbh remnant .",
    "the key process for alignment is the presence of a coherent gas inflow .",
    "they speculate that accreting gas exerts gravito - magnetic torques that suffice to align the spins of both the mbhs with the angular momentum of the large - scale gas flow in which the orbit is embedded .",
    "spin  disc alignment due to gravito ",
    "magnetic coupling has been studied by a number of authors in the case of isolated mbhs surrounded by their own discs ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ; natarajan & pringle 1998 ; scheuer & feiler 1996 , martin , pringle & tout 2007 ; perego et al .",

    "+ the first requirement can be fulfilled if the mbhs pair inside a dense , massive gaseous nuclear disc ( dotti et al . 2009 ) , such as that predicted to form in remnants of gas - rich major mergers by mayer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . to constrain the second requirement ,",
    "we analyse a set of 3d smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations already discussed in dotti et al .",
    "the high resolution of these simulations enables us to resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of each mbh during their inspiral inside the circumnuclear disc , and to map the distribution of angular momentum of the sph particles in the mbh vicinity .",
    "mbhs are modeled as _",
    "sink _ particles that can accrete gas particles , allowing us to constrain the amount of mass accreted onto each mbh , and the orientation of the mbh spins relative to the angular momentum of the accreted gas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we focus on the sph simulations , and describe the semi - analytical algorithm that evolves the mbh spins ; in section  3 we illustrate our results on the mbh alignment and our prediction for the recoil velocity of the mbh remnant ; in section  4 we present our conclusions .",
    "we follow the dynamics of mbh pairs in nuclear discs using numerical simulations run with the n  body / sph code gadget ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) , upgraded to include the accretion physics .",
    "the simulations discussed in this paper are the same as presented in dotti et al .",

    "two mbhs are placed in the plane of a massive circumnuclear gaseous disc , embedded in a larger stellar spheroid .",
    "the gaseous disc is modeled with @xmath8 particles , has a total mass @xmath9 , and follows a mestel surface density profile @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radial distance projected into the disc plane .",
    "the outer radius of the disc is 100 pc .",
    "the massive disc is rotationally supported in @xmath11 and has a vertical thickness of 8 pc .",
    "the internal energy per unit mass of the sph particles scales as @xmath12 , where the value of the temperature at the outer radius of the disc has been set in order to have the toomre parameter ( toomre 1964 ) @xmath13 everywhere , preventing the fragmentation of the disc ( the average value of @xmath14 over the disc surface is @xmath15 ) .",
    "gas is evolved assuming a polytropic equation of state with index @xmath16 or @xmath17 . in the former case ,",
    "the runs are denoted by `` h '' and are termed `` hot '' as the temperature is proportional to a higher power of density than in the latter class of runs ( `` cold '' cases , runs denoted by `` c '' ) . the cold case has been shown to provide a good approximation to a gas of solar metallicity heated by a starburst ( spaans & silk 2000 ; klessen , spaans , & jappsen 2007 ) .",
    "the hot case instead corresponds to an adiabatic monoatomic gas , as if radiative cooling were completely suppressed during the merger , for example as a result of radiative heating after gas accretion onto the mbhs ( mayer et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the spheroidal component ( bulge ) is modeled with @xmath18 collisionless particles , initially distributed as a plummer sphere with a total mass @xmath19 .",
    "the mass of the bulge within @xmath20 pc is five times the mass of the disc , as suggested by downes & solomon ( 1998 ) .",
    "the two mbhs ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are equal in mass ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the initial separation of the mbhs is 50 pc .",
    "@xmath21 , called primary for reference , is placed at rest at the centre of the circumnuclear disc . @xmath22 , termed secondary , is moving on an initially eccentric ( @xmath24 ) counterrotating ( retrograde mbh , `` r '' runs ) or corotating ( prograde mbh , `` p '' runs ) orbit with respect to the circumnuclear disc .",
    "given the large masses of the disc and the bulge , the dynamics of the moving mbh ( @xmath22 ) is unaffected by the presence of @xmath21 until the mbhs form a gravitationally bound system .",
    "we allow the gas particles to be accreted onto the mbhs if the following two criteria are fulfilled : + @xmath6 the sum of the kinetic and internal energy of the gas particle is lower than @xmath25-times the modulus of its gravitational energy ( all the energies are computed with respect to each mbh ) ; + @xmath6 the total mass accreted per unit time onto the mbh every timestep is lower than the accretion rate corresponding to the eddington luminosity ( @xmath26 ) computed assuming a radiative efficiency ( @xmath27 ) of 10% .",
    "+ the parameter @xmath25 is a constant that defines the degree at which a particle is bound to the mbh in order to be accreted .",

    "note that due to the nature of the above criteria , the gas particles can accrete onto the mbhs only if the time - varying bondi - hoyle - lyttleton radius is resolved in the simulations .    each gas particle accreted by the mbh carries with it angular momentum . from the properties of the accreted particles we can compute , as a function of time , the mass accretion rate and the versor @xmath29 , that defines the direction of the total angular momentum of the accreted particles .",

    "( 2009 ) . here",
    "we summarize this algorithm .",
    "we assume that during any accretion event recorded in our sph simulations , the inflowing gas forms a geometrically thin / optically thick @xmath35-disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) on milli - parsec scales ( not resolved in the simulation ) , and that the outer disc orientation is defined by the unit vector @xmath36 the evolution of the @xmath35-disc is related to the radial viscosity @xmath37 and the vertical viscosity @xmath38 : @xmath37 is the standard radial shear viscosity while @xmath38 is the vertical shear viscosity associated to the diffusion of vertical warps through the disc . the two viscosities can be described in terms of two different dimensionless viscosity parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , through the relations @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the disc vertical scale height and @xmath43 is the sound speed of the gas in the accretion disc .",
    "we further assume @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( lodato & pringle 2007 ) . we assume power law profiles for the two viscosities , @xmath47 , as in the shakura & sunyaev solution .    as shown by bardeen & petterson ( 1975 ) , if the orbital angular momentum of the disc around the mbh is misaligned with respect to the mbh spin , the coupled action of viscosity and relativistic lense - thirring precession warps the disc in its innermost region forcing the fluid to rotate in the equatorial plane of the spinning mbh .",
    "the timescale of propagation of the warp is short compared with the viscous / accretion timescale so that the deformed disc reaches an equilibrium profile that can be computed by solving the equation    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the radial drift velocity , @xmath50 is the surface density , and @xmath51 is the keplerian velocity of the gas in the disc .",
    "@xmath52 is the local angular momentum surface density of the disc , defined by its modulus @xmath53 and the versor @xmath54 that defines its direction .",
    "the boundary conditions to eq .",
    "[ eqn : angular momentum ] are the direction of @xmath55 at the outer edge @xmath56 , the mass accretion rate ( that fixes the magnitude of @xmath50 ) , and the values of mass and spin of each mbh .",
    "all these values but the mbh spins are directly obtained from the sph runs .",
    "in particular , the direction of the unit vector @xmath56 is computed considering those sph particles nearing the mbh gravitational sphere of influence that are accreted according to the criteria outlined in section 2.1 .",
    "also the mbh spin changes , not only because of accretion , but in response to its gravito - magnetic interaction with the disc on a timescale longer than the time scale of warp propagation ( perego et al .",
    "this interaction tends to reduce the degree of misalignment between the disc and the mbh spin , decreasing with time the angle between @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "the mbh spin evolution is followed by solving for the equation @xmath58 the first term in eq .",
    "[ eqn : jbh precession - disc ] accounts for the angular momentum deposited onto the mbh by the accreted particles at the innermost stable orbit ( iso ) , where @xmath59 denotes the specific angular momentum at @xmath60 and @xmath61 the unit vector parallel to @xmath62 , describing the warped disc according to the bardeen - petterson effect .",
    "the second term instead accounts for the gravo - magnetic interaction of the mbh spin with the warped disc .",
    "it modifies only the mbh spin direction ( and not its modulus ) , conserving the total angular momentum of the composite ( mbh+disc ) system ( king et al .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "2 peaks at the warp radius ( @xmath63 ) where the disc deformation is the largest .",
    "is where the vertical viscous time @xmath64 in the disc is comparable to the lense - thirring precession time . because @xmath65 and the radius at which the disc is maximally deformed are comparable ( perego et al .",
    "2009 ) , we simplify the notation in the paper using only @xmath63 . ]",
    "2 incorporates two timescales : the accretion time related to the first right - hand term describing the @xmath66folding increase of the spin modulus , and the shorter timescale of mbh spin alignment ( perego et al .",

    "@xmath68 is the mbh luminosity in units of @xmath26 .",
    "we applied iteratively eq . 1 and 2 using inputs from the sph simulation that give the values of the mass accretion rate , the mbh mass and the direction of @xmath69 .",
    "the algorithm returns , as output , the spin vector , that is , its magnitude and direction . at each timestep",
    "our code therefore provides the angle between the spin vector of each mbh and the angular momentum vector of their relative orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig : theta ] shows the time evolution of the relative angle @xmath70 between the spin of each mbh and the orbital angular momentum of the mbh pair ( @xmath71 ) , for two selected runs ( cp and hr ) .",
    "the initial relative angle ( @xmath72 ) has been arbitrarily set to 2.5 radians ( 143@xmath73 ) , while @xmath74 has initially five different values ( 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 1 ) .",
    "there is a common trend in all the runs for both mbhs : mbhs with lower spins tend to align faster ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] for @xmath75 myr ) and are affected by changes in the plane of the accreting material to a larger extent ( @xmath70 changes rapidly with time and has more pronounced minima / maxima for lower @xmath74 , see again fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] ) . as indicated by eq .  3",
    "a smaller spin modulus implies a shorter alignment time , and this explains the faster response of the mbh to orient its spin orthogonal to the plane of the accreted gas .",
    "a slowly - spinning mbh induces a weaker warp in the disc : the warp radius decreases with decreasing @xmath74 and there the lense - thirring precession time is faster so that the mbh is more responsive to changes in the orientation of the accreted gas ( see perego et al .",
    "2009 for details ) .",
    "the spin evolution depends also on the dynamical properties of the mbhs and on the thermodynamics of the circumnuclear disc .",
    "the effect of the initial orbital parameters is important during the first phase of orbital decay of the two mbhs , before they form a binary .",

    "we assume that the two mbhs can reach coalescence , and we use the distributions of @xmath82 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 shown in figure  [ fig : theta12 ] in order to compute distributions of recoil velocities for the mbh remnant .",
    "we assume also that the distributions of @xmath82 we obtained are representative of the relative angle between the mbh spins and @xmath88 during last phase of orbital decay , when the two mbhs lose efficiently orbital energy and angular momentum due to the gravitational wave emission .",
    "these assumptions are necessary because our simulations ( spatial resolution @xmath112 pc ) can not follow the evolution of the mbhs down to separations where gravitational waves dominate the dynamics .",
    "the two assumptions are valid if one of the following requirements is fulfilled :    @xmath6 the gas accretes onto the two mbhs in a coherent way until star formation and/or agn feedback deplete the galactic nucleus of gas , and no further accretion events ( i.e. due to tidal stripping of stars ) change significantly the direction of the mbh spins ;    @xmath6 the dynamical interaction between the binary and the gas creates a low density region ( the so called `` gap '' , gould & rix 2000 ) , reducing / halting accretion onto the mbhs ( milosavljevic & phinney 2005 ; dotti et al . 2006b ; hayasaki , mineshige , sudou 2007 ; cuadra et al .",

    "for these three fitting formulae we report the distribution of recoil velocities we would obtain assuming that the mbh spins are isotropically distributed ( green lines ) . because of the spin alignment discussed in sections  3.2 and 3.3 , the recoil velocities we obtain analysing the results of our simulations are approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those predicted for isotropically distributed mbh spins , independently of the fitting formula we consider . furthermore , the recoils obtained evolving the mbh pair in a cold circumnuclear disc are always a factor of @xmath122 smaller than the velocities obtained in the hot cases .",
    "this shift is due to the lower level of alignment between mbh spins and @xmath123 for mbhs orbiting in hot discs , as discussed in section  3.2 .",
    "the mean values of recoil velocities for these three fitting formulae and for different gas thermodynamics are shown the first two columns of table  [ tab : kicks ] . because the mean values can be affected by the long tails of the recoil distributions at high velocities , we report also the median values in last two columns of the same table .",

    "we find that :    @xmath6 when evolving a in dense , rotationally supported , structure such as a circumnuclear disc , mbhs in a pair align their spins ( @xmath143 ) to the pair orbital angular momentum ( @xmath88 ) well before the two mbhs bind in a keplerian binary , and independently of the mbhs initial orbital parameters . for a run with @xmath22 initially on a retrograde orbit , the spin of the secondary aligns efficiently only after the `` orbital angular momentum flip '' .",

    "this further reduces the recoil velocity of the mbh remnant .",
    "the degree of alignment between the two spins and between each spin and @xmath88 is preserved ( or even increased ) by spin ",
    "spin and spin  orbit interactions until the plunge phase ( schnittman 2004 ; herrmann et al .",

    "the thermodynamical properties of the environment affect the degree of alignment and , as a consequence , the expected recoil velocities .",
    "@xmath120 is lower ( by a factor of 1.52.2 ) for lower values of @xmath31 ;    @xmath6 assuming the same distribution of @xmath82 , the recoil velocity distributions obtained using different prescriptions are very similar .",
    "the three fitting formulae used predict the same mean and median recoil velocities ( @xmath145 ) within a factor of @xmath136 , with less than few percent of realizations having @xmath146 .",
    "the distributions of recoil velocities that we find have important consequences for retention of mbhs in galactic nuclei .",
    "when mbh binaries form and evolve in gas  rich major mergers , we predict the recoil velocity to be , on average , well below the escape speed from low - redshift galaxies . indeed , because of the extreme efficiency of the spin alignment process , the recoil velocities are likely unimportant even for high - z proto - galactic building blocks .",
