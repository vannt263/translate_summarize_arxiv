    "<S> , the lowest frequency eigenmode is not renormalized by interactions and is protected from decay by the kohn s theorem , which states that center of mass motion decouples from internal dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the combined effect of potential anharmonicity and interactions results in the depolarization shift and final lifetime of the kohn mode . </S>",
    "<S> all other excited modes of sloshing oscillations thermalize with the parametrically faster rate . </S>",
    "<S> our results are significant for the interpretation of recent experiments with trapped fermi gases observed weak violation of the kohn theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction_. properties of quantum liquids in one - dimension ( 1d ) , as realized experimentally in nanoscale semiconducting wires , carbon nanotubes , laser traps of cold atoms , and edge channels of the quantum hall effect , continue to attract tremendous attention in the physics research ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for recent reviews and references herein ) . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing sophistication in high precision measurements and techniques these systems provide serious tests for the existing theoretical models , such as luttinger liquid theory  @xcite , and ultimately challenge their completeness . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the powerful approach of the luttinger liquid formalism allows to account for the interaction effects nonperturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> however , this model does not adequately describe relaxation phenomena due to built - in approximation of the linearized quasiparticle dispersion , which by virtue of the kinematic constraints effectively closes the phase space available for inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> in certain special cases , the lack of relaxation may be a generic property of the many - body system because of its complete integrability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , vanishing relaxation rates may happen because of the reasons prescribed by the kohn theorem  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent experiments @xcite we study relaxation of collective excitations in interacting two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems confined along one of the two spacial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> these systems interpolate between strictly 1d limit of luttinger liquids and the two - dimensional fermi liquids . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical confinement in such systems splits the single band spectrum into multiple 1d subbands . </S>",
    "<S> the convenient and practically justified model idealization is the interacting particles confined by a harmonic potential . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the 1d subbands are equidistantly separated by a frequency of oscillations @xmath0 across the channel . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the spectrum linearization in the strictly 1d liquids , harmonic approximation in the quasi-1d case on one hand simplifies the dynamics , and at the same time does not allow for proper description of thermalization processes . </S>",
    "<S> one necessarily has to account for the confinement anharmonicity , which thermalizes the motion across the channel in much the same way as the spectrum nonlinearity causes the relaxation of charge and spin excitations in 1d quantum wires @xcite .    despite the similarity with 1d </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation of transversal excitations has a few distinct features setting these two problems apart . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematical constrains of momentum and energy conservations operational in 1d are less restrictive in quasi-1d . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the 1d case , which require three - particle scattering processes , the two - body collisions do cause the relaxation via the inter - subband transitions . </S>",
    "<S> thermalization in quasi-1d may nevertheless be prohibited due to the kohn theorem rather than kinematical restrictions .    </S>",
    "<S> this theorem states that the motion of the system as a whole is unaffected by interactions . </S>",
    "<S> classically , it follows as the translationally invariant interaction energy is insensitive to the system displacement as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason , quantum mechanically , the interaction drops out of the center of mass heisenberg equation of motion @xcite . in a quantum fermi liquid </S>",
    "<S> the kohn theorem follows from the landau galilean invariance relation between the quasiparticle effective mass and the first angular harmonic of the interaction amplitude @xcite .    in all of the above cases the kohn theorem </S>",
    "<S> states that if the confining potential is harmonic the collective sloshing oscillations proceed without decay . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the kohn , or so called sloshing mode , @xmath0 , is insensitive to interaction , temperature and particle statistics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this fact makes the observation of the kohn mode possible in a wide variety of systems . in semiconductor quantum wires </S>",
    "<S> the kohn mode is observed in optical transmission at far infrared @xcite . in </S>",
    "<S> trapped ultracold fermi gas of @xmath1li the kohn mode of a half khz frequency was excited by sudden displacement of the trap and detected by absorption imaging of a released cloud @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the weak violation of the kohn theorem due to anharmonicity observed in the above three classes of systems plays a key role in the data interpretation . in the case of the semiconductor quantum wires it controls the line broadening and the higher harmonics of light transmission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed sloshing frequency of an atomic cloud in the optical trap shows systematic deviations from the kohn theorem prediction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such deviations grow with heating as the expanding atomic cloud senses a progressively less parabolic confining potential . here </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on two fundamental aspects of kohn theorem violation : ( i ) depolarization shift of the sloshing frequency , and ( ii ) final lifetime of sloshing oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we approach this problem based on a very general grounds of hydrodynamic theory , which accurately describes most liquids at length scales long compared to the particle - particle mean - free path .     in lagrangian formulation . </S>",
