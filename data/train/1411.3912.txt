    "relativistic hydrodynamics is nowadays the standard approach for modeling ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at highest rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) and lhc ( large hadron collider ) energies .",
    "these dynamical descriptions are either based on ideal  @xcite or dissipative hydrodynamics  @xcite and describe the entire expansion fluid dynamically . in so called hybrid approaches",
    "@xcite only the early hot and dense stage of the expansion is described using hydrodynamics and the later dilute stage by hadron transport .",
    "most of these models use a conceptually similar procedure : given an initial condition , the hydrodynamic equations are solved in the whole forward light cone . near the boundary of vacuum and at the late times of evolution hydrodynamics is not applicable any more , when the density is small and the mean free path is larger than the system size .",
    "therefore , models switch to an off - equilibrium microscopic description in terms of particles in this region . in hybrid approaches particles can scatter , while other models allow only free - streaming and resonance decays . in any case ,",
    "the most commonly used way to convert the fluid - dynamical fields to particles , a process that we call here particlization , is by using the cooper - frye formula .",
    "the cooper - frye formula assumes particlization to take place on infinitesimally thin three - dimensional hypersurface in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "this hypersurface @xmath3 is usually determined a posteriori from hydrodynamical solution in the whole forward light cone , usually as a hypersurface of constant time , energy density , temperature , or knudsen number .",
    "particle distributions on an infinitesimal element of hypersurface , @xmath4 , are calculated using the following formula : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a distribution function and @xmath7 a normal four - vector of hypersurface with length equal to the area of the infinitesimal surface element .",
    "this formula was obtained by cooper and frye  @xcite with the main feature that it respects four - momentum conservation . though formula ( [ cf_formula ] ) is valid for any @xmath6 , the distribution function",
    "is usually assumed to be either the boosted thermal distribution @xmath8^{-1}$ ] ( ideal fluid ) , or a distribution close to the boosted thermal distribution @xmath9 ( viscous fluid ) , where @xmath10 is the dissipative correction .",
    "here @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are temperature , chemical potential and the flow velocity of the fluid , respectively",
    ".    there is , however , a conceptual problem with the cooper - frye formula . where the surface is space - like , _ i.e. _",
    ", its normal vector @xmath7 is space - like , and @xmath14 for some @xmath15 . thus if @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , as is the case for the thermal distribution , @xmath18 for some @xmath15 .",
    "this can be easily seen in the local rest frame of a space - like surface ( which always exists since @xmath19 for space - like surfaces ) , where @xmath20 and thus @xmath18 for momenta directed inward the surface . on the other hand , for those time - like surfaces which normal vector points toward the future ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 for any @xmath15 .",
    "this can be also understood as follows : surface is  escaping ",
    "faster than the speed of light , so no particle can cross it inward .",
    "( for a summary of the properties of time - like and space - like surfaces , see table  [ tab : surf_prop ] ) .",
    ".properties of surface elements . @xmath23 .",
    "the normal vector is directed toward lower density .",
    "rf abbreviates reference frame , @xmath24 denotes particle distribution from the hypersurface element calculated using the cooper - frye formula . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if @xmath25 is interpreted as a phase - space density , negative values of it are clearly unphysical , but instead of giving a literal phase - space density , cooper - frye formula rather counts the world lines of particles crossing the surface element @xmath4 , and gives positive weight to particles moving `` outward '' and negative weight to particles moving `` inward '' .",
    "thus the negative values of @xmath25 , the so - called negative cooper - frye contributions , refer to particles flying inward toward the hydrodynamical region , and which should thus be absorbed back to the fluid .    in pure hydrodynamical models ,",
    "this poses a problem : particlization takes place at freeze - out when rescatterings cease , and particles stream free .",
    "thus , once particles cross the particlization surface , there is nothing from where particles could scatter back toward the surface , and thus there should be no particles flying back . to avoid this problem , one could choose a completely time - like particlization hypersurface , for example a hypersurface of a constant time without any negative contributions .",
    "however , it was shown  @xcite that particle spectra obtained in such an approach are dramatically different from spectra on a constant temperature hypersurface .",
    "another way is to consider cut - off distribution  @xcite : @xmath26 .",
    "such a prescription violates conservation laws , unless one adjusts temperature , chemical potentials , and flow velocity in the particle distribution @xmath6  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", there is no such a problem in hybrid models .",
    "particlization takes place where rescatterings are abundant , and thus it is natural to have particles flying back to the fluid - dynamical region .",
    "the problem is rather a practical one : what does the negative weight of a particle mean when one samples the particle distributions at particlization surface to create an initial state for the hadron transport ?",
    "usually one simply ignores them ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which violates conservation laws .",
    "an attempt to include these negative weights to the hadron transport was recently made in ref  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the transition from fluid to transport takes place in a region where hydrodynamics and transport are equivalent , the negative cooper - frye contributions coincide with the distribution of particles that backscatter to hydrodynamical region .",
    "thus all one needs to do is to remove these particles from the cascade , but such removing is technically challenging , and the problem remains how to find the region where hydrodynamics and transport lead to equal solutions  assuming that such a region exists at all !",
    "thus the ultimate solution to the problem would be to construct a model , solving coupled hydrodynamical and kinetic equations with the kinetic model providing boundary condition for hydrodynamics .",
    "an attempt in this direction was taken by bugaev  @xcite , but these ideas have not yet been implemented in practice .",
    "fortunately , at high collision energies , the explosive expansion dynamics keeps the negative contributions on the level of a few percent .",
    "emission of particles from time - like areas of surface where no negative contributions appear ( so - called volume emission ) is much larger than emission from space - like areas ( so - called surface emission ) , and as we will discuss later , large flow velocity reduces negative contributions from space - like surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , there are very few studies that actually quote the values of negative contributions , and investigations at lower collision energies are lacking completely . in this article the negative contributions arising on the cooper - frye transition surface assuming distribution functions in local equilibrium",
    "are compared to the actual underlying microscopic dynamics to investigate the systematic differences between a transport and a hybrid approach .",
    "therefore , the aim of the current study is to compare the expected negative contributions in a locally equilibrated hydrodynamical approach with the actual number of particles that scatter back through a hypersurface in a coarse - grained microscopic transport approach .",
    "a constant energy density transition surface is constructed and negative cooper - frye contributions are compared to actual backscattered particles . in addition , the magnitude of negative contributions is calculated in a systematic way depending on hadron sort , collision energy , centrality , and choice of the transition surface . in section [ sec : methodology ] the framework for the calculation is explained .",
    "section [ sec : tests ] shows results of tests of the numerical setup and sensitivity to internal parameters of the calculation .",
    "finally , section [ sec : results ] contains physical results : the quantification of cooper - frye negative contributions and their comparison to backscattered particles .",
    "our calculation is based on the hadronic transport approach - ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd 3.3p2 ) @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom in urqmd are hadrons , resonances up to a mass of 2.2 gev and strings and the implemented processes include binary elastic and inelastic scatterings which mainly proceed via resonance formation and decays or string excitation and fragmentation at higher collision energies .",
    "the urqmd particles move along classical trajectories and scatter according to their free - particle cross - sections . in our studies",
    "there are no long range potentials and particle trajectories between collisions are always straight lines . using urqmd",
    "we simulate au + au collisions at laboratory frame energies @xmath27 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 and 160@xmath2 gev .",
    "this energy region is chosen because we expect urqmd to provide a reasonable description of the collision dynamics at those energies , and the cooper - frye negative contributions to become significant in this energy range .",
    "the general procedure for our calculations is :    1 .",
    "generate many urqmd events and coarse - grain them using a 3 + 1d space - time grid .",
    "2 .   find the local energy density in the landau rest frame of each grid cell , @xmath28 , and the collective flow velocity in each cell , @xmath29 .",
    "3 .   construct the hypersurface @xmath3 of a constant energy density @xmath30 .",
    "4 .   calculate the particle spectra on @xmath3 by using the cooper - frye formula and by counting the actual urqmd particles that cross @xmath3 . to obtain these spectra and to compare them to each other",
    "is the goal of the current work .",
    "this procedure mimics switching from hydrodynamics to transport in a hybrid model , but here the ",
    "hydrodynamical  picture is obtained by averaging over particle distributions on a space - time grid . since",
    "all the information is still available in the underlying microscopic approach we are able to compare the negative cooper - frye contributions to the spectrum of actual backscattered particles . in the following",
    "we explain all necessary details for each of these steps of the calculation .      to obtain the energy density in the landau rest frame as a function of space - time , that is necessary to construct the cooper - frye transition surface , the energy momentum tensor and the net baryon current in the computational frame",
    "are calculated @xmath31 where the sum is over all particles in each grid cell at the moment @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the baryon number of each particle .",
    "angular brackets denote averages over @xmath34 urqmd events .",
    "the cell sizes need to be small enough so that gradients of all relevant physical quantities within the cell are small . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cell sizes are too small one needs to generate infeasibly many events to damp statistical fluctuations of @xmath35 components from cell to cell , and obtain a smooth surface @xmath3 . to satisfy these conditions and to ensure energy conservation precisely we choose @xmath36 1 fm , @xmath37 = 0.3 fm and time step @xmath38 = 0.1 fm . for the highest collision energy , @xmath39 gev ,",
    "the gradients are larger , so even smaller grid sizes were taken : @xmath36 0.3 fm and @xmath37 = 0.1 fm .",
    "this choice is further discussed in the section [ sec : tests ] , where the sensitivity of results to the grid size is studied . since even @xmath40 events do not provide enough statistics to obtain a smooth hypersurface , and increase of @xmath34",
    "is not feasible due to limited storage capacities , the individual particles are smeared by marker particles distributed according to a gaussian distribution .",
    "every urqmd particle with coordinates @xmath41 and four - momentum @xmath42 is substituted by @xmath43 particles with coordinates distributed with probability density @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "these marker particles are attributed the 4-momentum and quantum numbers of the original particle divided by @xmath43 . in our calculation @xmath43",
    "= 300 and @xmath46 = 1 fm .",
    "the sensitivity of our results to the width of the gaussian is discussed in section [ sec : tests ] .",
    "when this gaussian smearing is applied , stable results are obtained with only @xmath34 = 1500 events , which we employ for our calculations .      after obtaining @xmath35 in the computational frame ,",
    "it has to be transformed to the landau rest frame ( lrf ) in each cell . by definition , @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the energy flow in the lrf is zero . to find the lrf we solve the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath48 .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is proportional to the 4-velocity of the lrf and the proportionality constant is fixed by the constraint that @xmath49 . after finding @xmath50 the hypersurface of constant landau rest frame energy density",
    "is constructed where @xmath51 , with @xmath52 a parameter that characterizes the hypersurface .",
    "in such a way we mimic the transition surface in hybrid models , which typically use @xmath531 gev/@xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the isosurface is constructed using the cornelius subroutine  @xcite , that provides a continuous surface without holes and avoids double counting of hypersurface pieces .",
    "the subroutine provides the normal four - vectors @xmath7 of the hypersurface .",
    "the physical quantities on the grid , _",
    "i.e. _ , the energy , net baryon density and the flow velocity , are linearly interpolated to the geometrical centers of the hypersurface elements .      to apply the cooper - frye formula",
    "one needs the temperature @xmath11 and chemical potentials on the surface , which do not exist in the microscopic picture . strictly speaking they make sense only in the vicinity of thermal and chemical equilibrium , which may not be the case in our urqmd simulation",
    "nevertheless , we take the lrf energy density and net baryon density to mean equilibrium densities  as is the case when deviations from equilibrium are small  and obtain temperature and chemical potentials from an ideal hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) equation of state ( eos ) containing the same hadrons and resonances as urqmd .",
    "since our eos assumes zero strangeness density , we impose this constraint as well , even if urqmd itself allows local non - zero strangeness . in practice",

    "the negative contributions for 160@xmath2 gev are slightly larger than in our calculation .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy lies in the difference of the velocity profiles on the hypersurfaces : in hydrodynamics the average relative velocity between flow and surface is smaller than in our transport - based approach , which leads to larger negative contributions .",
    "we have investigated negative cooper - frye contributions and backscattering using a coarse - grained molecular dynamics approach .",
    "au+au collisions at @xmath124@xmath125 gev energies have been simulated using urqmd , and a hypersurface @xmath3 of constant landau rest frame energy density has been constructed . on this surface",
    "we have calculated two quantities : the ratio of cooper - frye negative to positive contributions , which assumes local thermal equilibrium , and the ratio of urqmd particles crossing @xmath3 inward to crossing @xmath3 outward , which assumes no equilibrium .",
    "we found that at all collision energies the ratio of inward to outward moving particles calculated counting the urqmd particles is much smaller than the same ratio calculated assuming equilibrium , _ i.e. _ , the cooper - frye negative to positive ratio .",
    "this finding poses a question to the construction of hybrid models , and the treatment of freeze - out in hydrodynamical models : if the cascade leads to distributions nowhere near equilibrium , how are the hydrodynamical and cascade stages to be connected in a consistent fashion ? on the other hand , this result shows that an ideal fluid dynamics hybrid approach contains the worst case scenario for negative contributions and even then they are on the order of max .",

    "what remains to be seen , however , is whether we could get closer to the urqmd result if we allowed dissipative corrections to the distribution function of cooper - frye , or whether the deviations from equilibrium are so large that dissipative expansion is not feasible .",
    "the largest observed impact of negative contributions is to pion rapidity spectrum at midrapidity in central collisions . in thermally",
    "equilibrated cooper - frye calculations it constitutes 813% , but only 0.54% in the counting of urqmd particles .",
    "the cooper - frye value roughly agrees with the values obtained previously for hydrodynamics at 160 gev .",
    "we found several systematic features in these ratios .",
    "they are smaller for larger hadron mass and therefore largest for pions .",
    "the relative negative contributions decrease as a function of collision energy and by going from central to peripheral collisions . on the other hand",
    ", they increase if a higher energy density is chosen as a surface criterion .",
    "the small scale structures on the surface , its `` lumpiness '' , play a significant role : if the surface is not smooth enough both ratios can increase dramatically .",
