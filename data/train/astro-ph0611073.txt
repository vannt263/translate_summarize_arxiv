    "during the late stages of their evolution , stars with initial mass on the main sequence in the range 0.8 - 8 m@xmath2 reach the asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "this phase of stellar evolution is characterised by a strong mass - loss , the star expelling dust and gas at rates up to @xmath5yr@xmath3 .",
    "this is really important for the chemical evolution of our galaxy .",
    "it has been shown that mass - loss from this stars contributes to around half of the gas recycled by stars ( maeder 1992 ) .",
    "the mass - loss mechanism of agb stars is a two step process .",
    "shocks due to pulsations from the star produce gas surdensities that can trigger the formation of dust .",
    "then radiation pressure on dust make this dust escape the gravity of the stars .",
    "gas is thus also expelled thanks to friction with dust .",
    "the importance of agb stars on the chemical evolution of other galaxies is poorly known . in particular , the effect of metallicity on the mass - loss rates of agb stars is not well known .",
    "indeed , in low metallicity environments , less dust is expected to form .",
    "mass - loss rates should thus be lower in low metallicity environments .",
    "a theoritical work by bowen and willson ( 1991 ) predicts that for metallicities below 0.1 z@xmath2 dust - driven winds should be negligeable .",
    "observations in the magellanic clouds and the galaxy have shown that the total mass - loss rates ( dust+gas ) were similar in the three galaxies ( van loon 1999 ) .",
    "in fact the dust mass - loss rates are smaller in the magellanic clouds , but the gas - to - dust mass ratio are higher in these galaxies with low metallicities ( 0.3 z@xmath2 and 0.5 z@xmath2 for the small and large magellanic clouds respectively ) . in order to obtain better constraints on the effect of metallicity on the mass - loss rates from agb stars , and to know",
    "if dust - driven mass loss can occur at very low metallicities , we need to study the mass - loss rates from agb stars with low metallicities .",
    "we thus observed agb stars in the fornax and sagittarius spheroidal dwarf ( hereinafter sgrd ) galaxies .",
    "those galaxies have low metallicities , 0.008 z@xmath2 and 0.3 z@xmath2 respectively .",
    "furthermore the distance of these galaxies is quite known , making the estimation of the mass - loss rates easier than in the galaxy .",
    "the observations were made with the mid  infrared imager visir ( lagage et al .",
    "2004 ) , at the vlt ( paranal , chile ) .",
    "these observations were carried in visitor mode during 4 nights in july 2005 .",
    "we observed 28 agb stars in sgrd and 2 in fornax . due to bad weather and the weakness of the signal for some of the observed stars",
    ", we will present here results for 9 stars in sgrd and 1 in fornax .    to reduce the background emission from the sky and the telescope",
    ", we used the standart mid - infrared technique of chopping and nodding .",
    "we observed all the stars with the visir pah1 filter ( @xmath6=8.59@xmath7 m , @xmath8@xmath9=0.42@xmath7 m ) .",
    "the brightest stars were also observed with the visir pah2 filter ( @xmath6=11.25@xmath7 m , @xmath8@xmath9=0.59@xmath7 m ) .    [ cols= \" < ,",

    "in this work we have shown that agb stars in the sgr d sph and fornax galaxies were losing mass .",
    "dust - driven mass - loss is thus observed for this agb stars in low metallicity galaxies .",
    "we estimate dust mass - loss rate in the range 0.2@xmath0 - 1.3@xmath1 m@xmath2yr@xmath3 for the observed agb stars in sgrd and around 5@xmath4 m@xmath2yr@xmath3 for the observed star in fornax .",
    "to convert this value to total ( gas+dust ) mass - loss rates , one needs to know the gas - to - dust mass ratio .",
    "this ratio is not well known for galactic stars , so that i.e. for irc+10216 , the best studied agb stars , values in the range 170 - 700 are found in the literature ( menshchikov et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "it is difficult to determine this ratio in other galaxies .",
    "however , van loon ( 2000 ) as shown that this ratio was linearly decreasing with metallicity . a simplified view to explain this is that the fraction of metals avalaible for the formation of dust is proportional to metallicity , so that at lower metallicity , less dust is formed . if we consider that the metallicity in sgr d sph and fornax are 0.3 and 0.8 z@xmath2 respectively , then we can crudely estimate that the dust mass - loss rate in these galaxies are 1000 and 3000 times higher than in the galaxy . converting the dust mass - loss rates we estimated would thus lead to total mass - loss rates of the order of @xmath10- @xmath11m@xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "these rates are similar to the highest in the galaxy , but one has to consider these total mass - loss rates as really crude estimates .",
    "for example , the drift velocity ( the velocity difference between the gas and the dust fluid ) is not taken into account in these estimations .",
    "this drift velocity is certainly smaller at low metallicity so that the values estimated just above are certainly overestimated . to better understand the mass - loss of agb stars in these galaxies",
    ", we thus need to improve our models and study a larger sample of agb stars .",
    "such observations have been carried out or are schduled with spitzer or at the vlt and will enable to get constraints on the gas - to - dust mass ratio of agb stars in these galaxies and to study a wider range of infrared colours ( and thus to study the evolution of the mass - loss on the agb ) .",
    "this will be presented in forthcoming works .",
