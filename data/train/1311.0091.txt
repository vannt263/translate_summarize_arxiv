    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed an empirical star formation law between the surface densities of the star formation rate ( @xmath7 ) and the total gas ( @xmath8 ) , widely known as the kennicutt - schmidt ( k  s ) law .",
    "s law is written in the form of @xmath9 as stars are formed from molecular gas instead of atomic gas , @xmath8 in the k ",
    "s law is often replaced with @xmath5 .    with @xmath0co observations and the galactic standard co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor ( @xmath4 @xmath10 2.3 @xmath11 10@xmath12 @xmath13 ( k km s@xmath14)@xmath14 ; @xcite ) ,",
    "numerous works show that @xmath6 is in the range of 1.0  2.0 .",
    "the slope of the k  s law may provide us with clues that will help to explain the mechanism of star formation . for example , if star formation only depends on the mass of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , a constant sfr per unit mass of molecular gas is expected , leading to a linear relation between @xmath15 and @xmath5 and , namely , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if molecular gas is converted to stars with a timescale of free - fall time , and the scale height of gas is approximately constant everywhere in a galaxy , a slope of 1.5 is expected @xcite .",
    "if cloud - cloud collisions trigger star formation , the star formation timescale is set by the collision rate of the virially bound objects , resulting in a slope of @xmath172.0 @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some drawbacks of the current method of deriving the k  s law . at first , @xmath4 is not a constant but a function of metallicity and co intensity @xcite .",
    "observations have also shown that @xmath4 increases with decreasing oxygen abundance @xcite and co intensity @xcite .",
    "because oxygen abundance appears to be a function of the galactic radius in spiral galaxies @xcite , @xmath4 may vary within a single galaxy as well .",
    "for example , @xmath4 is 0.75 @xmath11 10@xmath12 @xmath13 ( k km s@xmath14)@xmath14 within the inner 1@xmath182 of m51 .",
    "it is approximately three times lower than the galactic standard @xmath4 , while its value rises to ( 1  4 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 @xmath13 ( k km s@xmath14)@xmath14 at @xmath19 2@xmath180 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , applying the galactic standard @xmath4 to external galaxies is not ideal .",
    "secondly , the nature of @xmath0co also limits its ability to determine @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath0co is optically thick , so it traces the emissions from the envelope of the gmcs , rather than the dense clumps / cores in the gmcs , where stars are formed . likewise , because of its high opacity , the intensity of @xmath0co does not indicate the amount of gas when gmcs start to pile up along the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath0co can be excited at a density as low as @xmath17 100 @xmath20 as a result of the photon trapping effect , the gas traced by @xmath0co is not necessarily associated with star formation .",
    "finally , diffuse emissions that do not relate to star formation are involved in the tracers of sfr , such as uv , 24@xmath21 m , and h@xmath22 .",
    "although @xcite show that the presence of diffuse emissions can alter the relation of @xmath5 and @xmath7 from linear to nonlinear , @xcite concluded that the contribution from the diffuse emissions alone is not sufficient to explain all the differences in the observed slopes .",
    "inspired by the above issues , we study the k  s law in a nearby galaxy ic 342 in terms of two aspects : the co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factors which depend on the metallicity and co intensity @xcite , and the utilization of an optically thin line @xmath3co ( 10 ) , which is reckoned to be a better tracer of the real mass distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ic 342 is a nearby face - on barred spiral galaxy located at 3.3 mpc .",
    "1@xmath23 corresponds to 16 pc at that distance @xcite .",
    "the co map made with a single dish shows a clear molecular bar with a length of approximately 4.5 kpc @xcite . a primary spiral arm emerging from the southern bar",
    "is found in the co map .",
    "ic 342 is undergoing bar - driven gas inflow @xcite which triggers the starburst at the center and therefore splits the physical environment from the galactic disk , providing a chance to study the k  s law in diverse physical conditions of molecular gas .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : the radio and infrared published data we used in this work are presented in section [ sec_data ] .",
    "the study of the radial distribution of the gas and sfr is shown in section [ raddist ] .",
    "the methods of deriving @xmath5 from @xmath0co ( 10 ) and @xmath3co ( 10 ) are demonstrated in section [ sec_xcolow ] and section [ ks13_high ] , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties of the methods are discussed in section [ uncermass ] .",
    "section [ ks ] presents the derived k  s law with both @xmath0co ( 10 ) and @xmath3co ( 10 ) . in section [ galaxies_literatures ] ,",
    "we examine the k - s law in other nearby galaxies using the published data of @xmath0co and metallicity to confirm the results from ic 342 .",

    "ic 342 is not included in the spitzer local volume legacy survey ( lvl ) and the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) , but in several individual programs , presumably because of its low latitude ( @xmath28=10@xmath2958 ) .",

    "the relevant studies have demonstrated that the metallicity ( 12+[o / h ] ) is a function of the galactocentric radius in spiral galaxies , although the slopes can vary between positive and negative @xcite . for ic 342 ,",
    "only five hii regions were observed to infer the metallicity gradient @xcite .",
    "it seems that the gradient is affected by the number of hii regions observed .",
    "@xcite , however , derive the gradient of metallicity with eight hii regions for ngc 6946 , classified as sab(rs)cd as ic 342 , and the result is consistent with the results derived with more than 200 hii regions in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the comparison demonstrates that the variation of oxygen abundance is on a global scale and the local fluctuation is not significant .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath2 attributed to the oxygen abundance alone is @xmath1740% .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the scatter of the measured oxygen abundance from the general trend at each position .",
    "the isotopic ratio [ @xmath0c]/[@xmath3c ] grows with radius in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , a constant @xmath3co abundance measured for the center is adopted for the entire region in this work because of the lack of abundance ratio along the galactocentric radius of ic 342 .",
    "@xmath3c is produced during the cno cycles of stars . in an active star forming region , e.g. , galactic center , @xmath3c is produced faster , influencing the interstellar isotope abundances .",
    "there are two subsequent mechanisms determining the @xmath3co abundance : fractionation reaction and photodissociation .",
    "the fractionation reaction @xmath83 enriches @xmath3co but requires relatively low temperature ( @xmath53 35k ) @xcite and uv photons to provide the ionized carbons , preferentially happening near the uv - exposed edges of gmcs .",
    "however , uv photons cause the photodissociation of both @xmath0co and @xmath3co as well ( @xmath84 ) . because self - shielding is more effective for h@xmath1 than co lines , photodissociation can reduce the @xmath0co and @xmath3co abundance relative to h@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , because @xmath0co has more effective self - shielding and larger abundance , the photodissociation destroys @xmath3co faster than @xmath0co . combining both phenomena",
    ", the abundance of @xmath3co depends on the relative rate of the fractionation and photodissociation.the combined effect can be small , and these phenomena compensate for one another @xcite , or leads to the underestimation of @xmath85 by 30%50% @xcite .",
    "providing that [ @xmath0c]/[@xmath3c ] ( or [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath3co ] as we have assumed ) has the same gradient as our galaxy @xcite , the isotopic ratio then increases from @xmath1740 at the galactic center to @xmath1750 at the spiral arm at 2 kpc .",
    "this deviation in the isotopic ratio is smaller than the uncertainties suggested by the above chemical processes .",
    "we have insufficient information to quantify the actual error .",
    "a maximum error of 50% contributed from the uncertainty of @xmath3co abundance is quoted in this work , but such large uncertainty is unlikely to be true if the abundance gradient is similar to that of the milky way .",
    "the interaction and energetics of gas and dust are complex . in terms of simulations",
    ", @xcite made starburst models to correlate the observed fir / submm / mm properties of gas and the star formation history of the starburst galaxy .",
    "the model predicts that @xmath65 is close to @xmath66 in high - column - density regions .",
    "@xcite use lvgs model to calculate the radiative transfer of the cooling and heating of gas and dust .",
    "the result shows that in the high - volume - density region with @xmath86 10@xmath87 @xmath20 the gas and dust grains become well coupled and @xmath65 @xmath32 @xmath66 .",
    "recent work has also suggested a similar threshold of 10@xmath88 @xmath20@xcite for good coupling between @xmath65 and @xmath66 . even though the critical density of @xmath3co is @xmath1710@xmath89 @xmath20 ,",
    "tracing the gas with density @xmath19 10@xmath89 @xmath20 , @xmath3co is useful to locate the dense cores embedded in gmcs @xcite , which have a typical density of @xmath1710@xmath90 @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising to see that @xmath3co coexists with 24 @xmath21 m emissions in both the spiral arm and the center of ic 342 @xcite .",
    "hence , the assumption of @xmath65 @xmath32 @xmath66 is rather fair for the molecular gas traced by @xmath3co in terms of gas density .    the inferred dust / gas temperature from sed fitting is @xmath17 20  25 k in the infrared bright galaxy ic 342 .",
    "although the temperature is consistent with the temperature of the cloud complexes in other infrared bright galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the galactic gmcs have typical temperatures of @xmath17 10 k , which is approximately two times lower than that of these infrared bright galaxies . nonetheless , it is unclear whether the external galaxies , especially the infrared bright galaxies , hold gas properties similar to those in our milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because @xmath0co is detected throughout the entire galaxy ( figure [ fig_ico ] ) , the map is first used to perform the k  s plot by using the value of @xmath5 based on @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the fitting of the k  s plot is dominated by the area with @xmath5 @xmath91 100 m@xmath25 pc@xmath26 because of the bulk of data points in this range .",
    "we therefore refer to the results as _ the k  s law in the low-@xmath5 region_. on the contrary , considering the fact that @xmath3co was only observed toward the co bright regions , the k ",

    "the @xmath92 routine @xmath93 @xcite is used to implement all the fitting of the k - s plots in this work . similar as the @xmath77 in  [ ks13_high ] , @xmath93 allows a user - defined function , then performs levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization for the dataset .",

    "the lower end of @xmath5 in @xcite is smaller than our estimate as a result of better sensitivity .",
    "the samples in @xcite have a physical resolution of 750 pc , approximately two times larger than in this study .",
    "previous works show that the physical resolution can affect @xmath6 of the k  s law owing to the evolution of gmcs . for a small scale ( @xmath17 60  100 pc ) ,",
    "discrete star forming systems have different evolutionary stages .",
    "for example , the youngest gmcs have no star formation but large amounts of molecular gas ( large @xmath5 , low @xmath7 ) , whereas old gmcs have the opposite characteristics ( small @xmath5 , large @xmath7 ) .",
    "these populations then scatter the k  s relation @xcite .",
    "our resolution of 320 pc and the 750 pc of @xcite are considerably larger than the physical sizes of the gmcs ; therefore , the abovementioned situation does not exist .",
    "instead , the k  s law represents a time - averaged relation , averaging many elements with various evolutionary stages , and thus the scaling relation of @xmath5 and @xmath7 can be maintained @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 of 1.11 @xmath78 0.02 in ic 342 is comparable to the average slope of 1.0 @xmath78 0.2 among the galaxies in @xcite .",

    "in conclusion , on the basis of the comparison with the larger sample in @xcite , we suggest that the relation of the gas and star formation properties in ic 342 are not considerably different from those of other galaxies . however , we should note that in addition to the influence from the intrinsic properties of gmcs @xcite , @xcite suggest that the configuration of gmcs and stars can affect @xmath6 of star formation law when observations are made with approximately sub - kiloparsec resolution . under this physical resolution ,",

    "the possibility of gravitational instability can not be ruled out because the tommre q parameter is well below unity in the central region of the galaxy ( figure [ fig_toomreq]).the two mechanisms may work together @xcite .",
    "that is , the gravitationally bound molecular clouds ( @xmath1710@xmath131 m@xmath25 ) are formed through the gravitational instability ; at the same time , cloud - cloud collisions are taking place between the clouds to form giant molecular cloud associations ( gmas ) .",
    "this scenario is able to explain the high sfe of the spiral arm in m51 @xcite .",
    "if the above scenario take places in the high-@xmath132 region of ic 342 , @xmath6 = 2  3 in this region represents a mix of the mechanisms .",
    "in addition to the difference in the effective star formation mechanism , the k  s law may be altered because of the change in the intrinsic properties of gmcs .",
    "@xcite have performed theoretical calculations of a two - component star formation law regardless of the galactic - scale process .",
    "the transition of @xmath132 is approximately 85 m@xmath25 pc@xmath26 . in the regions where the @xmath132 is greater than @xmath1785 m@xmath25 pc@xmath26 ,",
    "the galactic ism pressure is sufficiently large to be comparable with the internal pressure of gmcs , and thus the density of gmcs is forced to increase with growing @xmath132 to balance the pressures . at the same time , the free - fall time of the gmcs is reduced @xcite , resulting in faster star formation . on the other hand , at low-@xmath132 regions ,",
    "gmcs are independent of the environment so the @xmath128 is determined only by the gmcs themselves , implying a flattened k  s relation .",
    "we studied the kennicutt - schmidt ( k  s ) law in the nearby barred spiral galaxy ic 342 with published @xmath0co ( 10 ) , @xmath3co ( 10 ) , and infrared data .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .   after correcting for the oxygen abundance and @xmath0co intensity , the @xmath0co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor ( @xmath2 )",
    "was found to be 23 times lower than the galactic standard @xmath4 in the center of ic 342 and @xmath172 times higher than the @xmath4 in the galactic disk (  [ sec_xcolow ] ) .",
    "2 .   the power law index of the k ",
    "s plot is approximately 1.4 in the low-@xmath85 ( @xmath0co,@xmath2 ) regions ( often 25  60 m@xmath25 pc@xmath26 ) , and increases to approximately 2  3 at high-@xmath85 ( @xmath0co,@xmath2 ) regions ( around @xmath19 100 m@xmath25 pc@xmath26 ) (  [ sec_largespatialksxvar ] ,  [ ks12var ] ) .",
    "the larger slope in the environment of high surface density is confirmed with independent measurement of @xmath3co (  [ secks13 ] ) .",
    "3 .   by setting different lower limits of the dynamic range for fitting",
    ", we confirmed that the slope of the k ",
    "s law is gradually steepened with increasing @xmath85 , presumably as a result of the increase in the dense gas fraction (  [ sec_environ_var ] ) .",
    "4 .   using the published data of @xmath85 , @xmath108 ( measured at the sub - kpc scale ) , and the metallicity of nearby galactic disks and starburst centers , we confirm that the environmental variation in the k  s law in ic 342 may be a general case for spiral galaxies (  [ galaxies_literatures ] )",
    ". 5 .   the varied slopes from @xmath171.4 in the low-@xmath85 domain to @xmath17 2",
    " 3 in the central region may indicate the change in the main mechanism of star formation among the sub - regions in ic 342 , that is , the star formation is triggered by gravitational instability in the disk ; at the galactic center , the combination of gravitational instability and cloud - cloud collisions is favored (  [ sec_grav ] and  [ sec_ccc ] ) .",
    "the derived variable k ",
    "s law in a single galaxy also matches the theoretical prediction that the gmc properties change at the @xmath85 of approximately 85 m@xmath25 pc@xmath26 and star formation efficiency increases with @xmath85 (  [ sec_twocomp ] ) .",
