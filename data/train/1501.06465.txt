    "one - dimensional structures appear in various context of industrial applications .",
    "they are used , for example , in the modelling of polymers in suspensions , composite materials , nanostructures , fiber dynamics in turbulent flows and , in particular , fiber lay - down in technical processes of non - woven materials .",
    "furthermore , such structures have been modelled on different levels of description involving different scales . besides microscopic models , mesoscopic kinetic or fokker ",
    "planck equations have been widely used for a statistical description of the fiber or polymer distributions .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for concrete examples in the industry . in this article , we consider non - woven materials , which are webs of long flexible fibers .",
    "production processes and models corresponding to the lay - down of such fibers have been intensively investigated .",
    "see @xcite and the above cited references .    in the above mentioned investigations , the one - dimensional structures ( fibers ) under consideration were assumed to be mutually independent , which clearly does not represent reality .",
    "therefore , the present work aims at including fiber - fiber interaction , thereby describing the size of each fiber and , simultaneously , the absence of intersection among fibers .",
    "this is achieved by simply including the interaction of structures into a well investigated model described in non - woven production processes .",
    "taking into account the interaction of the structures on the microscopic level leads to coupled systems of stochastic differential equations .",
    "its statistical description should also take into account the interactions and will consequently no longer be based on the classical fokker  planck model .",
    "the new model makes use of a microscopic systems of retarded stochastic differential equations , and its mesoscopic description is obtained via formal mean - field procedures .",
    "the mean - field limit is described by a mckean  vlasov type equation with a delay term .",
    "we perform an analytical investigation of the mean field limit , as well as a numerical comparison of microscopic , mean field and macroscopic equations .",
    "the analysis of the limit is based on the work in @xcite . for numerical methods for mean - field type equations",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : starting from a model for independent fibers , we present in section  [ interacting ] a new model for interacting fibers , which takes into account the finite size of the fibers and prevents intersection of the fibers .",
    "the model is based on a system of retarded stochastic differential equations with suitable interaction potentials .",
    "section  [ meanfieldsection ] describes the mean - field equation and a discussion of its stationary solutions .",
    "the core of this section is devoted to the proof of the mean - field limit for the corresponding deterministic system , i.e. , the rigorous derivation of the mean - field equation from the system of retarded deterministic equations .",
    "section  [ diffusionsection ] contains the diffusion limit of the kinetic equation , while section  [ numerics ] contains a description of the numerical methods used for the microscopic and mean - field equations .",
    "the numerical results include an investigation and comparison of stationary states , as well as a convergence analysis of solutions to equilibrium for both the microscopic and mean - field equations .",
    "we finally conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we begin by reviewing a basic , mutually independent fiber model for the lay - down process of fibers , described by a stochastic dynamical system in dimensions @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . using the state space @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the unit sphere in @xmath3 , a fiber is given by a path of the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath4 with initial condition @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the so - called coiling potential , @xmath7 a nonnegative diffusion coefficient and @xmath8 the standard brownian motion .",
    "we use a coordinate free formulation , where @xmath9 denotes the stratonovich integral .",
    "note also that @xmath10 is the projector of @xmath3 onto the unit sphere @xmath2 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for related work .",
    "we equip our state space with the measure @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the lebesgue measure on @xmath3 and @xmath13 the normalized surface measure on @xmath2 .",
    "note that the dimensional scaling @xmath14 is introduced for convenience , in order to achieve a stationary state which does not explicitly depend on the spatial dimension .",
    "the fiber model above only describes the evolution of the center line of the fiber and does not capture the effects of the finite size of the fibers .",
    "hence , self - intersection and intersection among fibers are not prevented in the model . a possibility to remedy this deficiency it to include hysteresis into the system , which enables the system to prevent self - intersection , and for multiple fibers , intersection among them .",
    "considerations along this line of thought lead to the following interacting fiber model .",
    "consider @xmath15 fibers with position and velocity @xmath16 , for each @xmath17 .",

    ", we include a scaled , nonlocal ( in time ) interaction term @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an interaction potential , which is repulsive in our case , so as to avoid any contact among the fibers .",
    "note that a non - retarded version of this system would be similar to a model for swarming with roosting potential ( cf .",
    "in addition to the interaction term , our new model includes a delay term , i.e. , an integration with respect to time , to describe the fact that fibers interact with each other and with itself on the whole fiber length .",
    "the factor @xmath22 leads to the so called weak coupling scaling ( cf .",
    "similiarly , the scaling @xmath23 is a normalization of the potential with respect to the time integration .",
    "also note that the summation does not exclude @xmath24 , which accounts for self - interaction of a fiber with itself .",
    "there is some freedom in the choice of the interaction potential . as a simple example",
    ", one can use a mollifier type potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a nonnegative parameter representing the fiber radius and @xmath27 is a fixed constant describing the strength of the interaction .",
    "alternatively , a potential could be described by a smoothed version of heaviside type potential @xmath28 with heaviside function @xmath29 .",
    "a smooth version of such a potential may be given by @xmath30 for some regularizing parameter @xmath31 .",
    "+    in figure  [ compnoise ] we compare the fiber curves for different noise amplitudes @xmath7 .",
    "we use the coiling potential @xmath32 and the interaction potential @xmath21 from ( [ uinteraction3 ] ) , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "since the computation was done for a short amount of time , we neglect the scaling @xmath23 in front of the interaction part .",
    "we observe that the non - intersecting fiber curves are increasingly altered with increasing noise amplitude .    1 .   for @xmath35 ,",
    "one obtains a fully decoupled system for @xmath36 , and each fiber is described by the mutually independent model given in ( [ 2dmodelcoordfree ] ) .",
    "2 .   to consider inelastic interactions",
    ", one could include damping terms depending on the velocity in the interaction potential .",
    "this would lead to equations where a dissipative force is included in the interaction term .",
    "3 .   as in the case without interaction",
    ", it is also possible to formulate a smooth version of the interacting fiber system .",
    "the basic idea is to replace the brownian motion on the sphere by an ornstein  uhlenbeck process ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to include reference curves @xmath37 into the model , which describes , for example , the motion of a conveyor belt .",
    "this can be done in the following way .",
    "we denote with @xmath38 the actual fiber curves .",

    "we formulate a slightly more general model than ( [ 2dmodelcoordfreeinter ] ) .",
    "since , in reality , the fiber material is transported away by the belt , interaction will not take place for the full history of the fibers .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to consider a cut - off with a cut - off size @xmath49 .",

    "the associated mean - field equation for the distribution function @xmath54 may be formally derived from the microscopic equations following the procedure described , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the equation reads @xmath55 with deterministic force term @xmath56 , given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gradient on @xmath59 , and diffusion operator @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the laplace ",

    "if a reasonable scaling of the computing time with the number of processors is to be achieved , the parts of the code running in parallel have to be as mutually independent as possible , in order to reduce the overhead in communication between parallel threads .",
    "therefore , we divided @xmath200 into smaller groups of fibers , which then interact only within each group , thereby enabling a parallel computation with very little overhead .",

    ", we investigate the time decay of the distance to equilibrium for microscopic and mean - field equations and compare it to the one obtained for the case without interaction .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of the stationary solutions with respect to the parameters of the interaction model is investigated .",
    "for all computations we consider the three dimensional case for ( [ modelshortdelay ] ) .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we choose the interaction potential given in ( [ uinteraction3 ] ) with @xmath262 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "the coiling potential @xmath265 is chosen as @xmath266 .",
    "we are especially interested in the comparison of the numerical results for the mean - field equation and the microscopic stochastic model .",
    "for this comparison , we consider different noise coefficients @xmath7 and a box - shaped initial condition for the mean - field equation given by @xmath267 ^ 3,\\ , \\tau_3>0\\\\ 0 , & \\text{else } \\end{cases},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath268 denotes the third component of the vector @xmath66 and @xmath269 is a normalizing constant .",
    "the corresponding initial condition for the microscopic system can be obtained by randomly placing particles in the cube @xmath270 ^ 3 $ ] with initial velocities having the third component larger than zero .",
    "we start the investigation by studying order of convergence of the numerical method for the mean - field equation described above .      in this section",
    "we give a numerical investigation of the method for the mean field equation for the case without interaction .",
    "although the method is not a second order method , owing to the geodesic grid , the numerical results show that the numerical order of convergence is of order two .",
    "let @xmath271 be the number of spatial grid points in each direction and @xmath272 the number of cells on the sphere , @xmath273 and @xmath274 are the respective grid sizes .",
    "note , that @xmath274 is the average grid size on the geodesic grid .",
    "the spatial step size was chosen to match @xmath274 .",
    "the following grid sizes were simulated :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    from this data , we obtain the convergence plot shown in figure  [ rate ] .          in figure  [ figstat ] , we consider the stationary distributions obtained from the microscopic and mean - field equations for different values of the delay @xmath261 .",
    "we show radial plots of the radially symmetric density function .",
    "the case without interaction is compared to the case with interaction , with delay given by @xmath275 .",
    "the grid resolutions simulated for the mean - field equations were @xmath276 points in each spatial direction with a grid size of @xmath277 for the cases without interaction and the cases @xmath278 . to slightly reduce the computing time , we used a smaller spatial resolution of @xmath279 and @xmath280 in the cases with @xmath281 . in all cases",
    ", the sphere was discretized by 320 geodesic triangles , which led to an average cell midpoint distance of @xmath282 .",
    "these grid sizes where matched by the histograms generated from the microscopic fiber positions and velocities .    to achieve smooth data ,",
    "the total number of simulated fibers has to be chosen sufficiently large . in the case without interaction ,",
    "the microscopic density is generated from @xmath283 simulated fiber positions .",
    "for the cases with interaction , we computed 800 realizations of a system of 600 interacting fibres and generated the histogram from the fibre positions of all the realizations , which means that the histogram is based on @xmath284 microscopic fiber positions .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the interaction computation in the microscopic context is quite costly .",
    "so , although the computing time for @xmath283 fibres without interaction took only a couple of minutes , depending on how many processing cores we have at our disposal , it took up to several days of computing time for the case @xmath285 , which is the most expensive task here .",
    "computing times for the mean - field solver lie in the range of @xmath286 to @xmath287 hours on the given hardware , which was an intel xeon e5 2670 with 8 cores at 3.3ghz .",
    "as expected , the stationary distribution does not change with different values of @xmath261 .",
    "however the stationary distribution for the case with interaction is significantly wider than the distribution for the case without interaction .",
    "we note that the solutions obtained by the microscopic and by the mean - field equation are in very good agreement for the cases considered here .",

    "again , the case without interaction is compared to the case with interaction with cut - off given by @xmath275 . in figure",
    "[ figfleece1 ] , the case @xmath289 is considered , while figure  [ figfleece2 ] shows the case @xmath290 .     and",
    "@xmath289.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   and @xmath289.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the figures provide a strong indication that all cases with interaction converge to the same stationary distribution .",
    "we also observe the exponential decay to equilibrium for the case without interaction ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a theoretical exposition ) .",
    "furthermore , the graph in green shows the case with a strongly retarded potential .",
    "the decay is no longer strictly monotone and it takes more time to achieve the stationary state , in comparison to the cases without significant delay .     and @xmath290.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   and @xmath290.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ a ] displays a comparison between the decay to equilibrium for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "as can be observed , the decay becomes slower and , in particular , less and less regular for smaller values of @xmath7 .     with @xmath132.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "finally , we investigate the behavior of the stationary solution for different parameters in the interaction model .",
    "in particular , we expect a wider profile for larger radii , as well as for stronger interaction , i.e. , @xmath269 large . to numerically analyze the behavior for the different parameters , we consider the stationary equation in fixed - point form ( [ eq : fixedpoint ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the change of the stationary solution for varying parameters @xmath26 and @xmath269 respectively .    in figure  [ fig3fleece ] ,",
    "the stationary solution is shown .",
    "first , we consider the case of varying radius @xmath26 .",
    "we use the potential @xmath21 from ( [ uinteraction3 ] ) and keep @xmath269 and @xmath291 fixed . as we can see in figure  [ fig3fleece ] , the solution @xmath63 is becoming less concentrated for increasing radius @xmath26 .",
    "second we vary @xmath269 keeping @xmath26 and @xmath291 fixed obtaining similiar results as before .     for different values of the radius @xmath26 and different values of the factor @xmath269 in the interaction potential.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for different values of the radius @xmath26 and different values of the factor @xmath269 in the interaction potential.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this work we extended existing models for describing the lay - down process of fibers during the production of non - wovens to a model , which captures the interaction between the fibers by using a system of retarded stochastic differential equations and their corresponding mean - field approximations . a theoretical investigation of the mean - field limit for the deterministic retarded system is included .",
    "the solutions of the ( retarded ) microscopic and mean - field approximations are numerically compared with each other . in particular , the stationary solutions and",
    "the decay to equilibrium is numerically investigated .",
    "different types of interaction potentials are presented and the influence of different parameters in the interaction potential is investigated .",
    "furthermore , a large diffusion scaling for the mean - field equations has been considered .",
    "another interesting theoretical issue which has not been treated in the present work is the analytical investigation of the convergence of the retarded mean - field equation towards equilibrium .",
    "here we give a proof of proposition [ prop : exists ] , compare @xcite .",
    "we begin by writing the differential equation in its integral form @xmath292 let @xmath125 be arbitrary but fixed and set @xmath293\\times\\r^m;\\r^m)$ ] .",
    "we now denote @xmath294 to be the operator on the right hand side , and show the existence of a unique fixed point for this operator .    to see that this operator is well - defined , let @xmath295 .",
    "the first to terms on the right hand side are obviously well - defined .",
    "let us now consider the third term . by definition of the push forward measure , @xmath296;\\text{w--}{\\mathcal{p}}_1(\\r^m))$ ] .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath297 for every @xmath298 $ ] , we infer that @xmath299;{\\text{lip}}_b(\\r^m))\\hookrightarrow { \\mathcal{b}}_t$ ] . a simple reformulation of the term under the integral leads to @xmath300 with @xmath301 . from the assumptions ,",
    "we conclude that this term is continuous in @xmath302 $ ] and lipschitz in @xmath303 .",
    "consequently , the third term is well - defined .",
    "altogether , we have that @xmath304 as required .    as a first estimate",
    ", we obtain @xmath305 from the lipschitz continuity of the mappings on the right hand side . denoting @xmath306",
    "we obtain for the cases @xmath260 , @xmath307 and @xmath259 , the following estimate : @xmath308 where we used integration by parts in the equality . with this estimate at hand ,",
    "we construct a solution by the picard iteration procedure , and show that the generated sequence converges .",
    "we , therefore , define the sequence @xmath309 recursively by @xmath310 for @xmath311 , and denote @xmath312 applying the above estimate iteratively leads to @xmath313 \\sup_{0\\le t_k\\le t}{\\mathcal{e}}_0(t_k).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] elementary computations of the term in the bracket gives @xmath314 for any @xmath311 . since the series @xmath315 summing up the terms @xmath316 in @xmath311 yields @xmath317 and hence @xmath318 pointwise in @xmath104 .",
    "consequently , the picard sequence @xmath319 converges uniformly in @xmath320 to the solution of the integral equation ( [ eq : integral ] ) .",
    "since @xmath321 was chosen arbitrarily , the solution may be extended to @xmath101 .    as for uniqueness , we take two solutions @xmath322 and @xmath323 of the integral equation , and denote its difference by @xmath324 from the estimates above",
    ", we have @xmath325 let @xmath125 be arbitrary but fixed .",

    "since @xmath321 was chosen arbitrarily , this uniqueness result extends to @xmath330 .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath260 .",
    "as above , we establish a unique solution @xmath331 . setting @xmath332 as initial value , the integral form for @xmath333 reads @xmath334 with the same notations as above",
    ", we obtain the following estimate @xmath335 the second term on the right hand side may be expressed in the form @xmath336 where we used integration by parts in the first equality , and the fact that @xmath337 in the last inequality .",
    "consequently , there is a constant @xmath127 , such that @xmath338 constructing a sequence @xmath339 via the picard iteration for some arbitrary but fixed @xmath340 , with @xmath341 for @xmath342 $ ] , we obtain as above @xmath343 notice that @xmath344 on @xmath345 $ ] .",
