    "dielectric resonators have applications in microwave and optical frequency ranges , including antennas @xcite and as building blocks of impedance - matched huygen s metasurfaces @xcite .",

    "these methods are inaccurate for the moderate values of permittivity available at optical frequencies , and more sophisticated methods are needed to account for radiation effects .",
    "open nanophotonic resonators such as meta - atoms , nano - antennas and oligomers are typically strongly radiative systems , where loss can not be treated as a perturbation .",
    "furthermore , in many nanophotonic systems , material dispersion and losses can not be neglected , further complicating the problem of finding their modes .    in radiating and dissipative systems",
    "the modes have complex frequencies @xmath1 , corresponding to damped oscillations of the form @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding modal fields @xmath4 do not possess the orthogonality usually found in the modes of closed systems , and they are commonly referred to as quasi - normal modes @xcite .",
    "they are particularly useful for solving dipole emission problems @xcite , since they allow a mode volume to be defined for open cavities @xcite .",
    "a significant practical difficulty is the requirement to normalise a mode with diverging far - fields @xcite .",
    "a different perspective on this problem can be found within the microwave engineering literature @xcite , originally motivated by time - domain radar scattering problems . by using integral methods to solve maxwell s equation , only currents on the scatterer need to be solved for , avoiding having to explicitly handle the diverging far - fields . as it is based on finding the singularities of a scattering operator ,",
    "this approach is referred to as the singularity expansion method ( sem ) .",
    "the field distributions corresponding to these singularities are identical to the quasi - normal modes at the complex frequencies of the singularities @xmath1 .",
    "when solving scattering problems on the @xmath5 axis , the fields in the sem approach are reconstructed from the dyadic green s function , which remains finite in the far - field .",
    "thus the sem avoids the most significant practical disadvantage of quasi - normal modes based on fields .",
    "recently it has been shown that the singularity expansion method can be applied to meta - atoms and plasmonic resonators @xcite , clearly identifying the modes which contribute to scattering and coupling problems . however , finding all modes within a region of the complex frequency plane requires an iterative procedure with multiple contour integrations@xcite .",
    "this greatly increases the computational burden , and it remains unclear how robust this procedure is .",
    "in addition , it has not yet been demonstrated whether all spectral features can be explained by such a model , particularly the interference between non - orthogonal modes in the extinction spectrum and suppression of back - scattering corresponding to the huygens condition@xcite .    in this work , a robust integral approach to finding modes of open resonators",

    "the singularities of @xmath25 will dominate the spectrum of the response , and by mittag - leffler s theorem the response may be expanded in terms of these singularities @xcite .",
    "they correspond to solutions which can exist in the absence of a source , and hence they can be used to model the response to an arbitrary incident field .",

    "this is typically achieved by overlapping electric and magnetic dipole type resonances .",
    "[ fig : directional - scattering ] shows the forward and backward scattering amplitudes , with peaks labelled according to the corresponding resonant modes .",
    "the first peak of forward scattering corresponds to the overlap of modes i and iii , with almost purely electric dipole radiation , and mode ii , with almost purely magnetic dipole radiation .",

    "it is significant that all of these multipole moments radiate anti - symmetric electric fields into the forward and backward directions .",

    "this suggests that to optimise this generalised huygens effect , the meta - atoms should be placed within a homogeneous dielectric environment , as has been done for all - dielectric huygens metasurface @xcite . a dielectric substrate without a compensating superstrate introduces coupling between modes of opposite symmetry@xcite , greatly complicating the design process and degrading the directionality of scattering",

    "<S> the modes of silicon disk meta - atoms are investigated , motivated by their use as a building block of huygens metasurfaces . </S>",
    "<S> a model based on these modes gives a clear physical explanation of all features in the extinction spectrum , in particular due to the interference between non - orthogonal modes . by performing a vector spherical harmonic expansion of each mode , </S>",
    "<S> the complex features of the far - field scattering spectrum are also readily explained . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in general each mode has contributions from many multipole moments . </S>",
    "<S> higher order modes with appropriate symmetry are also able to satisfy the huygens condition , leading to multiple bands of strong forward scattering and suppressed back scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate a robust approach to find the modes of nano - photonic scatterers , commonly referred to as quasi - normal modes . by utilising an integral formulation of maxwell s equations , the problem of normalising diverging far - fields </S>",

    "<S> the approach is implemented in an open - source code . </S>"
