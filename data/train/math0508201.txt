    "[ q1 ] how many lattice points lie on the circle and 2 .",
    "how are these distributed around the circle ?    ]    why are these questions interesting ?",
    "well , aside from the intrinsic number theoretic and geometric importance , there is , perhaps surprisingly , an application to the boltzmann equation in the kinetic theory of gases .      under certain hypotheses ,",
    "the behavior of a gas is described by the _ boltzmann equation _ : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the _ phase space density _ of the gas , that is , it describes the expected mass density of the gas at time @xmath7 in the point @xmath8 in six - dimensional phase - space , where @xmath9 is a position in space and @xmath10 is a velocity .",
    "+ if we replace @xmath11 with any spatial dimension @xmath12 , the boltzmann equation , although losing its physical sense , is still of mathematical interest .",
    "we will consider the case @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is called the _ collision term _ and is given in the 2-dimensional case by @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the velocities after the collision and @xmath17 those before .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 is a quantity describing the probability that two particles with relative velocity @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 collide with relative deflection angle @xmath21 .",
    "we have the relations @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a unit vector with @xmath24 , which follow from the laws of conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "in other words , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are endpoints of a diameter of a circle with radius @xmath27 , centered at @xmath28 .",
    "+ in a _ discrete velocity model _ ( dvm ) , one considers a discrete set of possible velocities .",
    "( see @xcite for more details . ) here we will consider a dvm where the velocities belong to the set @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is some lattice in @xmath1 . set @xmath32 so that @xmath33 as @xmath34 , in some suitable sense .",
    "we want to prove the _ consistency _ of the dvm , i.e. the property that @xmath35 let @xmath36 then , by a change of variables , @xmath37 when we discretize the integral in , the outer integral turns into a sum over all lattice points @xmath38 , @xmath39 , while for the inner integral we get a sum over all @xmath23 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 belong to @xmath29 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for this is that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus we get @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the area of a fundamental region of @xmath31 and@xmath45    it is clear that @xmath46 is a @xmath47-periodic function of @xmath21 , and so can be expressed as a fourier series .",
    "it turns out that , assuming certain regularity conditions on @xmath46 , a sufficient condition for to hold is that we have sufficient nontrivial cancellation in the exponential sums @xmath48 as @xmath49 grows , if @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "+ fainsilber , kurlberg and wennberg proved @xcite that if we choose @xmath31 to be @xmath52 , then holds provided @xmath46 is a @xmath53-function .",
    "this is done by identifying @xmath52 with the ring of gaussian integers , @xmath54\\subset\\mathbb{c}$ ] , and applying number theoretic methods .",
    "the results of this paper indicate that we can equally well consider the hexagonal lattice defined above , corresponding to the ring of integers in the algebraic number field @xmath55 .",
    "similar methods to the ones used here should give the same results for every imaginary quadratic number field @xmath56 with class number 1 ( and thus unique factorization into irreducibles ) .",
    "there are exactly 9 such fields : @xmath56 has unique factorization if and only if @xmath12 takes one of the values 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 11 , 19 , 43 , 67 or 163 ( see @xcite , ch.13,1 ) .",
    "+ moreover , it is reasonable to expect to hold for any lattice @xmath31 such that @xmath57 for dimensions @xmath58 ( i.e. , including the physically relevant case @xmath59 ) , the consistency of a dvm based on the lattice @xmath60 was proven by bobylev , palczewski and schneider @xcite , using deep number theoretic results .      to answer the questions on page , we will view the lattice not as a subset of @xmath1 but of @xmath61 , and use number theoretic methods .",
    "we identify the lattice with the set @xmath62=\\{a+b\\omega\\ ; \\ a , b\\in\\mathbb{z}\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath63 this is in fact the ring of integers @xmath64 in the algebraic number field @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath66 is a quadratic number field , the norm @xmath67 of an element @xmath68 is just the squared complex modulus @xmath69 .",

    "the key point is , that each lattice point @xmath79 on the circle with radius @xmath4 corresponds to a representaion of @xmath80 as a product of two elements @xmath79 and @xmath81 in @xmath64 .",
    "fortunately , @xmath64 is a principal ideal domain , hence a unique factorization domain , so all such representations can easily be found by factorizing @xmath80 into rational primes .",

    "moreover it is easily seen that @xmath91 is inert , since the equation @xmath92 has no integer solutions .",

    "<S> we study the angular distribution of points in the hexagonal lattice ( i.e. , @xmath0 $ ] ) lying on a circle centered at the origin . we prove that the angles are equidistributed on average , and show that the discrepancy is quite small for almost all circles . </S>",
    "<S> equidistribution on average is expressed in terms of cancellation in exponential sums . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce hecke l - functions and investigate their analytic properties in order to derive estimates on sums of hecke characters . using a version of the halberstam - richert inequality , these estimates then yield the desired results for the exponential sums .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting consequence of these bounds is that the discrete velocity model ( dvm ) for the boltzmann equation is consistent when using a hexagonal lattice . </S>"
