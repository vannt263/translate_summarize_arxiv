    "40004000  = 1000              it was recently reported that the x - ray afterglow of gamma - ray burst grb  011211 , as observed with _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic / pn , contained spectral emission lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , r02 )  the first report of multiple x - ray emission lines from a grb .",
    "these lines , at 0.45 , 0.70 , 0.89 , 1.21 , and 1.44 kev were interpreted to be from he - like  ( rest energy 1.35 kev ) and h - like ( 2.0 kev ) ,  ( 2.62 kev ) ,  ( 3.32 kev ) and  ( 4.10 kev ) , redshifted to @xmath3=1.88 .",
    "the difference between this and the known redshift of the host galaxy @xmath1 was modeled as due to supernova ejecta traveling at @xmath111200 km s , which had originated during a supernova 4 days prior to when the grb jet illuminated it , producing the afterglow ( a more detailed analysis by the same authors was completed after this paper was in its initial form ;    the statistical significance of the individual lines was not reported in r02 ; it was stated that joint analysis of the lines taken together produced an improvement in the  value which , by an f - test , yielded a significance level of 99.7% .",
    "in addition , it was found that monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were unable to produce the the same improvement in  found between the best - fit power - law model and the best - fit five emission - line model more than 0.02% of the time .",
    "specifically , it was found that the best - fit  value for a power - law model was improved by fitting to a model of a mekal plasma with emission lines at rest energies corresponding to unresolved , , , , and  redshifted to @xmath9 in only 0.02% of the simulated spectra ( a 99.98% confidence detection ) .",
    "the implications of the model discussed by r02   a delay between a supernova and a grb on a timescale of days , the formation of a thin shell of supernova ejecta , an apparent under - abundance of fe relative to the detected nuclei  provide severe constraints on gamma - ray burst emission models .",
    "in addition , as demonstrated by r02 , the future detection of multiple emission lines can provide extremely strong constraints on the production mechanisms , due to the inherent required outflow velocity and emission timescales which can be derived from them , not to mention the implied association with supernovae .",
    "similar spectra observed with greater s / n in the future would greatly aid in unravelling the emission mechanisms and geometry of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "therefore , it is of wide theoretical ( e.g. ) and observational interest to further interpret the observed x - ray spectrum of this grb  011211 , in hopes of determining what more could be learned from future , more precise observations .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : anal ] , we describe the observation , and perform a basic spectral analysis using continuum models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] , we compare monte carlo ( mc ) realizations of acceptable continuum models with the grb spectrum , and find that the reported features would be produced in @xmath410% of the continuum model spectra , due only to poisson noise . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ka ] , we adopt the model that the two apparently most significant lines are k@xmath2 lines of  and ; we perform a blind search for features of the same significance in mc realizations of continuum spectra , and find that they would be reported from @xmath41.2 - 2.6% of such spectra , again , due only to poisson noise .",
    "we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : mcbad ] a practical challenge to the reliability of the mc  analysis produced by r02 .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] that the lines are not individually significant in the absence of an imposed model , and are only marginally significant when the adopted model is imposed .",
    "these conclusions conflict with those of r02 .",
    "r02 derived the model ( that is , the observed line energies , or redshift ) from the data , and then applied statistics for detection as if the energies were known prior to examining the data ( that is , single - trial statistics ) .",
    "this is not appropriate when the model line energies are derived directly from the x - ray data , and not from an a priori model ",
    "one derived without examination of the x - ray data ( for example : line energies of multiple features with redshifts of the host galaxy ) .",
    "we adopt statistics appropriate to a blind - search for these features , across a range of energies or redshifts ( multi - trial statistics ) .",
    "this accounts for the diminished significance we find for the features .",
    "we further discuss the reasons for this conflict and conclude in ",

    "we analyzed the identical source and background _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn @xcite spectrum as used by r02  ( their fig .",
    "2 ) , which was kindly made available to us by the authors in electronic form ( j. reeves , priv .",
    "we used the same response matrix ( epn_ff20_sdy9_thin.rsp ) .",
    "the spectrum used 5000 sec of realtime observation beginning at 07:14:33 ut on 12 dec 2001 , with a total live time of 4440 sec .",
    "the pn spectrum used counts comprised of patterns 04 ( singles and doubles ) , from a circular region 46 in radius centered on the source , excluding flagged events ( for which the keyword flag!=0 ) and excluding a region near the edge of the ccd chip .",
    "we performed a basic spectral analysis using xspec v11.1.0 @xcite .",
    "we used data in the 0.2 - 12 kev energy range .",
    "we performed a non - standard spectral binning , implemented to maximize the signal - to - noise associated with the reported emission features at the reported energies .",
    "we first binned data with energy bins centered at the five best - fit line energies found by r02 , with bin - sizes approximately equal to the fwhm epic / pn energy response at each energy ( respectively : 62 ev , 66 ev , 68 ev , 72 ev and 75 ev ; see eq .",
    "[ eq : fwhm ] ) .",
    "the remaining data were binned with 60 ev or greater ( @xmath12 1 kev ) , and 70 ev or greater ( @xmath131 kev ) . between 0.2 and 5 kev ,",
    "each bin has @xmath1315 counts ( although they were not binned on this basis ) , for which @xmath14 fitting is valid .",
    "we fit an absorbed photon power - law spectrum to the data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : best ] .",
    "the model spectrum was statistically acceptable ( model parameters are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] , along with the obtained values ) .",
    "we also fit the model with a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( wabs*bremss ) , and derived an acceptable best fit .",
    "finally , we found best - fit model parameters for the values of the power - law photon slope ( models 2 and 3 ) and @xmath15 ( models 5 and 6 ) at the 90% confidence limits of the best - fit , which will be used in mc simulations in   [ sec : mc ] .",
    "we first determine which of the reported lines are individually statistically significant , when one is searching for emission lines at _ a priori _ known energies .",
    "we compared the observed spectrum with mc simulations of six featureless spectra ",
    "the three absorbed power - law and three absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung which are models 1 - 6 in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we used a `` matched filter '' , convolving the observed pulse - invariant ( pi ) counts spectrum with a gaussian energy response , with the energy resolution response of the detector .",
    "the matched filter approach maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio as a function of energy of unresolved lines in the x - ray pi spectrum .",
    "this approximation was derived from the line in this figure .",
    "the epic / pn energy resolution has been demonstrated to be stable over 9 months of in - flight calibration @xcite .",
    "we expect that this analysis ( and that of r02 , since that work is based on the same energy response matrices ) is valid as long as the energy resolution is within 20% of this approximation ( corresponding to 3 of @xmath415 pi channels at 0.75 kev ) .        where @xmath18 is the number of pi bins , and we sum across pi bins which are within 3@xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the raw pi spectrum , which contains both source and background counts , and @xmath22 is the pi bin number .",
    "the centroid ( average ) energies and energy widths ( @xmath23 ) of the pi bins were taken from the ebounds extension of the response matrix , where @xmath24 is the pi bin number and @xmath25 .",
    "we do not correct the pi spectrum for the detector area ; however the detector area does not change dramatically across the fwhm of the lines . if the area did change dramatically across the fwhm of a line , and a statistical excess",
    "were observed in the area - corrected pi spectrum but not in the raw pi spectrum , then such an excess could well be be due to calibration uncertainties .      to determine if these features are significant , we produced mc spectra of models 1 - 6 ( see   [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "the mc realizations of the raw pi spectra were performed as follows .",
    "we simulated the spectral models 1 - 6 in xspec , using the same response matrix as above , so that the resulting pi spectra ( without poisson noise added ) were convolved as the observed spectrum through the telescope and detector response .",
    "the simulated pi spectra n(@xmath27 ) each had a total of @xmath139 counts in pi bins between 0.2 - 3 kev .",
    "we then produced integrated spectra @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( the integrated normalized model is used for the mc simulation as described below ) .",
    "these constitute our six acceptable featureless spectral models ; we will compare the data with results from all six , as a firm conclusion that emission lines are present should be independent of the underlying broad - band model assumed .",
    "we implemented a background spectral model , to simulate the @xmath410% of the counts due to background .",
    "taking background from a different part of the detector , we find that it can be parameterized by a broken photon power - law ( bknpower ) , with @xmath31 at low energies , break energy 1.35 kev , and @xmath32=0.44 at high energies , between 0.20 - 7.3 kev ( there is a strong background line at 8 kev ) .",
    "in fact , there are statistically significant deviations from this pure continuum model between 0.55 - 0.6 kev ; we ignore these deviations in our background model . in our mc simulation",
    "the effect of ignoring what would appear to be a line in the observed spectrum is conservative , in the sense that by ignoring its presence in the background model , we could detect as `` significant '' a line in the 0.55 - 0.6 kev range which is in fact produced by instrument background .",
    "we simulated spectra between 0.2 and 3 kev , in which there were 560 counts in the observed spectrum , of which we estimate @xmath4661.2 counts are due to background .",
    "we drew , for each mc realization , a number of background counts which is random poisson deviate ( using poidev , ) with an average of 66 counts , with the remaining ( of 560 ) counts from the source .",
    "to produce a simulated spectrum , we generate a random uniform deviate @xmath33 between 0 and 1 , and we place a count in the pi bin in which @xmath34 .    to produce our confidence limits to @xmath35",
    ", we produced 1667 mc realizations each of models 1 - 6 for a total of 10002 realizations .",
    "we set the 99% and 99.9% confidence limits at the 100th and 10th greatest values , respectively , of @xmath35 of all such realizations .",
    "this insures that the conclusions are not dependent upon the assumed featureless spectral model .",
    "the results of this mc simulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : convolve]a .",
    "two of the reported features ( near 0.7 kev and 0.85 kev ;  and ) have single - energy - trial probabilities of @xmath1399% confidence in comparison with the featureless spectral models ( the claimed  line peaks just below the 99.9% confidence limit ; we will treat it as having met 99.9% confidence , while the reader may regard this as an upper - limit ) .",
    "the remaining three lines are not significant in comparison with single - energy - trial probability of 99% confidence .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : convolve ] , we also show @xmath35 for single mc realizations of the best - fit power - law spectrum ( model 1 ) , which also contain apparent features . the bumps in the single simulated spectra appear because in any spectrum which contains poisson noise , the counts will not be distributed uniformly in energy , but will be clustered in energy simply due to counting statistics .      since it was necessary to perform a blind - search for emission line features in the grb spectrum  as the redshifted line energies were not known _ a priori _ , but were measured from the data  it is necessary to estimate the chance probability that the reported features are produced from a featureless spectrum during a blind search for such features .",
    "we produced 10000 mc realizations for each of models 1 - 6 as described in the previous section .",
    "we compared the @xmath35 of these between 0.4 and 1.5 kev against the single - energy - trial 99% and 99.9% confidence limits we found in the previous section , for the models 1 - 6 individually .    in table",
    "[ tab : counts ] we list the fraction of the 10000 mc spectra in which @xmath35 in at least one pi bin reaches a single - energy - trial probability of 99% or 99.9% confidence .",
    "these fractions are 78 - 79% and 14 - 17% , respectively ; if finding a single - energy - trial 99% ( ) and 99.9% ( ) feature were statistically independent , then the probability of observing both a 99% and 99.9% single - energy - trial `` line '' in a single spectrum , such as we find in the present spectrum of grb  011211 , is @xmath3610% .",
    "therefore , in a blind - search of the epic / pn spectrum for emission features , we would expect to find features which have single - energy - trial significance equal or greater to those observed in one of approximately ten observed featureless spectra .",
    "in this section , we examine if the reported lines , taken together , implicate k@xmath2 emission features from the particular redshift of @xmath3=1.88 as reported by r02 .",
    "we do so by summing the @xmath37 , using the values of the rest energies of the reported lines :      where @xmath39 denotes the pi bin number , @xmath40 is the centroid energy of the @xmath39th pi bin , @xmath24 denotes the index @xmath41 $ ] of the five lines reported detected ; @xmath20 denotes the rest energies of the five lines identified by r02 , which were 1.35 ( ) , 2.00 ( ) , 2.62 ( ) , 3.32 ( ) , and 4.10 kev ( ) .",
    "we examined the range of @xmath42 , with a step - size of @xmath43 .",
    "we use pi bins with energies 0.1 - 7 kev , to cover the spectrum past the rest frame energy of .",
    "we find 638 counts in this energy range , of which we estimate 80 are from background .",
    "we use only bins which are within 3@xmath44 of each @xmath45 .",
    "the result of this convolution , if the reported lines are real , should be a maximum in @xmath46 near the optimal redshift value , in excess of that found from mc realizations of data with featureless spectra .",
    "the average value of @xmath47 will systematically increase with increasing @xmath3 as the lines are shifted to lower energies , where the intensity is higher in the power - law spectrum and the detector effective area is larger and so there are a greater number of counts . to examine",
    "if any particular maximum in @xmath46 is significant , we performed this convolution for 10000 mc realizations using the simulated spectral models 1 - 6 , taking the 100th and 10th highest values , as described in the previous section , to produce the 99% and 99.9% confidence limits respectively .",
    "the results of the calculation using all 5 reported lines , as well as the 99% and 99.9% mc confidence limits , are in fig .",
    "[ fig : fivelines ] .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is in excess of the 99% mc confidence limit at @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] , and in excess of the 99.9% mc confidence limit at @xmath50 .",
    "we also performed this convolution and monte - carlo simulation using what appear to be the most significant two lines from fig.2 of r02 (  and ) , the results of which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fivelines ] .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is in excess of the 99% mc confidence limit at @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] , and in excess of the 99.9% confidence limit at @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "what fraction of featureless spectra , with the same number of source and background counts as the observed spectrum , would produce values of @xmath46 of comparable significance to the excess in @xmath54 from the observed spectrum ?",
    "if one examines @xmath46 only at @xmath9 , the answer is @xmath121% , which is the single-@xmath3-trial probability .",
    "however , the reported @xmath9 is different from the known redshift of the host galaxy @xmath5 ; it is therefore unlikely that @xmath9 was the only redshift which would be considered consistent with an _ a priori _ model by r02 .",
    "the pertinent statistical question to ask , then , is what is the fraction of featureless x - ray spectra , examined for a redshifted pair of  and  lines , would produce a value of @xmath46 comparable to the single-@xmath3-trial significance observed , allowing for a blind - search at values of @xmath3 between 1.88 and 2.40 ( a range of equal magnitude redshift and blueshift from the host galaxy ) ?    to address this , we simulated 10000 mc spectra of each of spectral models 1 - 6 , and found @xmath46 in the same way as for the observed spectrum in the previous section .",
    "we used only the 2-line model , as this gave the apparently most significant result near @xmath9 .",
    "we compared @xmath46 with the 99% and 99.9% mc limits , found in the previous section , and noted when these were exceeded in at least one @xmath3 bin for the 99% confidence limit , and in at least seven consecutive @xmath3 bins for the 99.9% confidence limit between @xmath9 and @xmath55 .",
    "we require seven consecutive @xmath3 bins as this is the number of @xmath3 bins in @xmath46 we find in excess of the single - trial 99.9% confidence limit near @xmath9 .",
    "( we require only 1 bin for the 99% confidence limit to satisfy a minimal `` detection '' requirement ; whereas we require seven bins for the 99.9% confidence limit , since this was what was actually observed near @xmath9 , and we wish to evaluate the likelihood of producing the observed @xmath46 excess ) .",
    "the fraction of mc featureless spectra which contained at least 1 @xmath3 bin between @xmath9 and @xmath55 in excess of the single-@xmath3-trial mc probability of 99% are given in table  [ tab : ztab ] . because the observed spectrum gave @xmath56% in seven consecutive @xmath3 bins , we also used this as our criterion to count `` hits '' in the @xmath1399.9% confidence comparison , also shown in table  [ tab : ztab ] .",
    "of 10000 mc spectra , between 20 - 22% produced `` hits '' for the single-@xmath3-trial 99% confidence limit , and 1.5 - 1.9% produced `` hits '' for the the single-@xmath3-trial 99.9% confidence limit .",
    "we note that when we search the range @xmath57 ( instead of 0.26 ) the percentage of featureless spectra which have seven consecutive @xmath3 bins with @xmath46 greater than the 99.9% limit is 3.8 - 5.0% .",
    "however , it is unclear if r02  would have attached equal significance to a detection at @xmath58 as one at @xmath9 , as no limits on excess line emission as a function of assumed redshift are given , and the redshift phase - space examined by r02  was not given .",
    "we therefore rely on our search of the smaller phase - space ; while this may underestimate the number of `` effective trials '' used by r02 , it nonetheless serves as the probability of producing the claimed excess line emission due a statistical fluctuation within the @xmath59 observed .",
    "if the redshift space examined by r02  were 1.14 - 3.14 ( @xmath60 ) , then the probability of finding an excess equal or greater than that observed would be 3.8 - 5.0% .",
    "if the full redshift space of 0 - 5 was in fact examined by r02 then the probability of a false detection is @xmath133.8 - 5.0% .",
    "a mc  test as employed by r02 is not fundamentally flawed as is the analytic  test ( that is , the f - test ) for the application of spectral emission line discovery . in the f - test",
    ", the reference  distribution was derived under the assumption that the null hypothesis lies on the border of the acceptable parameter space @xcite , which is not true in a search for emission lines ; however , this assumption is not made in the mc  test .",
    "thus , the simulated  distribution can , in principle , provide a reliable reference distribution with which the value of from application to real data can be compared to determine the false positive rate .",
    "however , as we show below , the mc  test as employed by r02(and described more fully by r02b ) suffers from a practical problem which makes it an inferior approach to the one we have applied .",
    "specifically , to apply the  statistic using the mc approach , one must assuredly find the _",
    "minimum  for the applied model for every single mc realization ; the description of the analysis performed by r02 ( and r02b ) does not assure that this has occurred .    in the case of  minimization through local mapping of the  surface , as in the modified levenberg - marquart method employed in xspec (;",
    "modified from the curfit algorithm as described by ; see also ) , one finds the vector in multi - parameter space along this surface which provides the most negative derivative , follows along this vector a short way , and iterates , until one reaches a point where there are no negative derivatives in any direction along the  surface ( that is , when one has reached a minimum point .",
    "this approach suffers from the well known problem of local minima , where the true global minimum can lie at a completely different set of parameter values ( see , for example , p. 394 ) . on simple  surfaces , where the second partial derivatives of the  surface are everywhere small  certainly in the case of the 2- parameters power - law spectrum",
    "it is rare that local minima different from the global minimum are found .",
    "however , on complex  surfaces ( those which contain large second partial derivatives of )  as will be the case when fitting a six parameter model of three emission lines of specified rest energy with variable fluxes and redshift plus a power - law ( slope and normalization )  local minima are common ; subsequently , this approach is unsuited to the unassisted discovery ( by computer alone , without human intervention ) of the global minimum .",
    "it is , for example , common occurrence when using a multi - component ( of more than , say , three ) parameters in xspec that some final human assistance is required to find the global minimum , since almost always it is a local minimum which is found unassistedly by the computer ; the quantitative difference in  between the computer - discovered local minimum and the true global minimum will depend on the complexity of the  surface .",
    "in general ,  surfaces become more complex with the addition of more model parameters , and the discrepancy will be greater when there are greater covariances between model parameters ( such as can be expected between flux for line 1 vs. line 2 , or vs. the continuum , or for each of the lines and the continuum , or for the relative flux for the lines and the spectral slope ; and so on ) . the only certain means to overcome this known deficiency is to evaluate  on a parameter grid with resolution in each parameter dimension much smaller than ranges where the  value changes by 1 .    thus , while the global minimum will likely be found from unassisted discovery for the power - law spectral model , it is more likely that only a local minimum will be found for the six - parameter model when the search for this minimum is not human - assisted .",
    "this will underestimate the value of  for that realization ; over the entire ensemble of mc realizations , there are then fewer false positives , and the significance of the  in support of the presence of lines will be overstated .",
    "in addition to the problem of local minima , the local minimum found will be dependent upon initial parameter values ( that is , the algorithm is path - dependent ) ; it therefore does not lend itself to duplication by different groups .",
    "also , the spectral fitting is non - analytic , such that the magnitude of a possible discrepancy can not be evaluated _ a priori_.    xspec  which r02 states was used for the mc simulation  does perform the  minimization approach .",
    "we suggest that it is unlikely that human - assisted spectral fitting  as is common practice when attempting to find the global  minimum for a single spectrum in xspec ",
    "was performed for all 10,000 mc spectra by r02 , as we found ourselves was necessary for the single spectral fit to the real data , as this would be an impractically long task .",
    "we are unable to attempt to duplicate the result of r02 , because performing assisted spectral fitting on 10,000 mc spectra is impractical , and in any case , we know of no deficiency in our present approach .",
    "our approach , in contrast , is analytic and not path - dependent and , therefore , more robust .",
    "we have attempted to confirm the observational statistical significance of emission lines in the x - ray afterglow of grb  011211 . in a blind - search for individual emission lines between 0.4 and 1.5 kev , features of significance equal to those observed",
    "will be found in one in ten featureless spectra .",
    "thus , the reported features can be said to be detected with 90% confidence in a model - independent way .",
    "also , a blind - search for the two - line complex (  and ) at any redshift between the reported value ( @xmath9 ) and a blueshift of equal magnitude from the host galaxy ( @xmath55 ) would find such features with equal significance to that observed in 1 of 60 featureless spectra ( 1.3 - 1.7% of the time , depending on the intrinsic spectrum ) .",
    "thus , the features as reported can be said to be detected with 98.3 - 98.7% confidence , in a model - dependent interpretation , where we search for two features due to  and k@xmath2 redshifted to some value of @xmath3 in the range @xmath612.140.26 .",
    "the difference between the present statistics and those of r02  are due to the different statistical arguments used to establish the existence of the emission lines .",
    "while r02  relies on single - trial statistics , we find the model used by r02  ( k@xmath2 lines , at a redshift different from that of the host galaxy ) was derived directly from the data , which therefore requires a statistical analysis appropriate to a blind search . by expanding the searched phase - space , and taking into account the multiple trials of a blind search , the confidence in the detection drops from the 99.98% of r02  to , the 98.7% ( best case ) we find here .",
    "moreover , r02  did not estimate the individual significances of the lines as we do here ; thus we find that such `` lines '' would appear in between 15 - 78% of observed featureless spectra for a single - trial significance comparable to that of the reported  or  lines .",
    "the analysis of these data has otherwise recently been called into question .",
    "have shown that there is a background line associated with the epic / pn detector edge during the observation , which would have been included in the grb spectrum from the first 5 ksec , when the source was near the detector edge , but not afterwards , after the source had been moved away from the detector edge . in our own analysis , we can not confirm this result unless we adopt non - standard event selection criteria , which differ from the ones used by r02 .",
    "r02  removed events near the ccd detector edge ( flag==0 ) and selected only single and double events ( pattern<=4 ) ( j. reeves , priv . comm . ) .",
    "these selections result in a smooth , featureless background spectrum with with no bright line - like feature near @xmath62 ( as seen in fig .  4f of ) as well as a reduction of the count rate by a factor of @xmath63 in the range @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : masao ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are not able to confirm the applicability of @xcite to the analysis of r02 .",
    "an alternative approach to the one we have taken is employed using xspec , in which one fits a featureless spectrum to the data , and then a spectrum which includes emission lines , to determine if the change in  is significant , as according to an f - test ; this is the approach taken by r02 .",
    "however , this approach for the detection of emission or absorption lines is formally incorrect , and gives false statistical results @xcite particularly so when the true continuum is not well constrained , as in the present case .",
    "we therefore prefer our approach of applying a matched energy response filter for line detection at arbitrary energies , and to compare this with application of the matched filter to mc realizations of featureless spectra .",
    "it is a trivial statistical exercise to demonstrate that matched filtering maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio ( and thus detectability ) for detection of infinitely narrow emission lines .    in estimating the model - dependent confidence limit for the detection of the line complex ( 98.7% )",
    ", we accounted only for searching the redshift phase space between @xmath9 and @xmath55 , symmetric about the host galaxy redshift  an extremely minimal requirement .",
    "we did not account for the full redshift phase space searched by r02 , as such was not given in that reference ; if the redshift phase space searched by r02  covered @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , then the detection significance of the two strongest lines (  and ) together decreases from 98.3 - 98.7% to 95 - 96.2% confidence .",
    "finally , we did not include in this confidence limit the number of trials implicit in searching five x - ray spectra for emission lines , which was performed by r02  for different time periods ( 0 - 5 ksec , 5 - 10 ksec , 10 - 15 ksec , 15 - 20 ksec , and 20 - 27 ksec ) .",
    "if we presume the same search was made on all five spectra , as seems a reasonable _ a priori _ search to perform , then the detection confidence for the  and  lines together decreases to @xmath67@xmath68=77 - 82% .",
    "we regard 98.7% to be a conservative ( in the sense of permitting a higher significance ) upper - limit to the confidence of detecting the  and  lines together , while a more accurate accounting of the number of trials and phase - space searched by r02  produces a 77 - 82% confidence limit .",
    "we consider neither a 90% confidence detection in a model - independent interpretation , nor a 98.3 - 98.7% confidence detection in a model - dependent interpretation , to be sufficient to justify the detection claims and subsequent interpretation put forth by r02 . the 77 - 82% confidence limit , which accounts for the wide @xmath3-phase space and number of spectra examined by r02 , is well below any comfortable detection confidence .",
    "if the @xmath3 phase space actually searched by r02is larger , the number of implicit trials is greater , and our estimate of the confidence level for the detected line complex would decrease .",
    "moreover , if one concludes that the marginal detection of the 2 lines ( si & s ) near @xmath9 is significant , then one must also conclude that the detection of all 5 lines near @xmath8 is equally significant .",
    "in addition , if one concludes that the marginal detection of the 5 lines near @xmath9 is significant , then one must also conclude that the detection of 2 lines ( si & s ) near @xmath7 is equally significant .",
    "therefore , one can not conclude simply that a complex of k@xmath2 line emission is detected near @xmath9 ; these data permit alternate interpretations of such complexes near @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "as the statistical excesses are due to the same `` features '' in the observed spectrum , the interpretation of the statistical excess in the context of the model presented by r02  is degenerate and can not be resolved with these data alone .",
    "prospects for confirmation of line features in grbs are very good , considering that the x - ray spectral integration for grb  011211  was begun 11 hours after the grb was initially detected , and required 1.4 hrs of integration to obtain . decreasing the reaction time would permit a longer integration , while the afterglow is brighter in the x - rays , and the marginal results found here may well be improved upon .",
    "we are grateful to j. reeves , who generously made his observed spectrum of the first 5 ksec of the _ xmm - newton _  observation of grb  011211available to us , that we might independently analyze it .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge useful conversations with a. macfadyen , r. blandford , and d. fox .",

    "<S> a 0.2 - 12 kev spectrum obtained with the _ xmm - newton _  epic / pn instrument of grb  011211 , taken in the first 5  ksec of a 27 ksec observation , was found by reeves  ( 2002 ; r02 ) to contain emission lines which were interpreted to be from , , , , and , at a lower - redshift ( @xmath0 ) than the host galaxy ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the spectrum independently , and find that the claimed lines would not be discovered in a blind search . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , monte carlo simulations show that the significance of reported features , individually , are such that they would be observed in 10% of featureless spectra with the same signal - to - noise . imposing a model in which the two brightest lines would be and  k@xmath2 emission velocity shifted to between @xmath3=1.882.40 </S>",

    "<S> when we account for the number of trials implicit in a search of five energy spectra ( as were examined by r02 ) , and permit a wider @xmath3-phase space search ( @xmath51.0 ) , the detection confidence of the two line complex decreases to 77 - 82% . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath6 line complexes are also found at @xmath7 and @xmath8 of significance equal to or greater than that at @xmath9 . </S>",
