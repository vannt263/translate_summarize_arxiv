    "dense starless cores in nearby low - mass star - forming regions such as taurus represent the simplest areas in which to study the initial conditions of star formation .",
    "the dominant component of starless cores , h@xmath5 , is largely invisible in the quiescent interstellar medium , so astronomers typically rely on spectral line maps of trace molecules and continuum observations of the thermal emission from dust to derive their kinematics and physical state .",
    "however , it is now well established that different species and transitions trace different regions of dense cores , so that a comprehensive multi  line observations , together with detailed millimeter and sub  millimeter continuum mapping are required to understand the structure and the evolutionary status of an object which will eventually form a protostar and a protoplanetary system .",
    "previous studies of starless cores in taurus , as well as other nearby star - forming regions , have shown that the relative abundance of many molecules varies significantly between the warmer , less dense envelopes and the colder , denser interiors ( see ceccarelli et al .",
    "2006 and di francesco et al .",
    "2006 for detailed reviews on this topic ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown that carbon - bearing species such as c@xmath11o , c@xmath12o , c@xmath13s , and cs are largely absent from the cores l1544 , l1498 and l1517b at densities larger than a few 10@xmath3 @xmath14 , while nitrogen - bearing species such as n@xmath5h@xmath6  and ammonia are preferentially seen at high densities . the chemical variations within a starless core are likely the result of molecular freeze  out onto the surfaces of dust grains at high densities and low temperatures , followed by gas phase chemical processes , which are profoundly affected by the abundance drop of important species , in particular co ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the past few years",
    "it has also been found that not all starless cores show a similar pattern of molecular abundances and physical structure .",
    "indeed , there is a subsample of starless cores ( often called pre - stellar cores ) , which are particularly centrally concentrated , that shows kinematic and chemical features typical of evolved objects on the verge of star formation .",
    "these features include large values of co depletion and deuterium fractionation , and evidence of `` central '' infall , i.e. presence of infall asymmetry in high density tracers in a restricted region surrounding the mm continuum dust peak @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that not all _ physically _ evolved cores show _ chemically _ evolved compositions , as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to study in detail a larger number of cores to understand what is causing the chemical differentiation in objects with apparently similar physical ages .",
    "this is why we decided to focus our attention on tmc1c , a dense core in taurus , with physical properties quite similar to the prototypical pre ",

    "[ spectra_map ] shows the profile of the main hyperfine component of the ( 10 ) transition ( f@xmath18,f = 2,3 @xmath19 1,2 ) across the whole mapped area ( see sect .  [ maps ] ) .",
    "we will discuss these spectra in more detail in sect .",
    "[ infall ] , but for now it is interesting to see how the profile shows complex structure , consistent with inward motion ( red boxes ) as well as outflow ( blue boxes ) and absorption from a static envelope .      from fig .",
    "[ iramspec ] and [ spectra_map ] , it is clear that the main ( 10 ) hyperfine components are self - absorbed around the dust peak position .",
    "therefore , a map of the ( 10 ) intensity integrated under the seven components will not reflect the column density distribution .",

    "[ infall_dust_peak ] , where the weakest and the main ( f@xmath18 f = 23 @xmath19 12 ) components toward the dust peak position ( the most affected by self - absorption ) are plotted together for comparison .",
    "the two hyperfines in fig .",
    "[ infall_dust_peak ] have very different profiles : the main component is blue - shifted , suggestive of inward motions ( see sect .  [ infall ] ) , whereas the weak component is symmetric and its velocity centroid is red shifted compared to the main component , indicating optically thin emission .",
    "given that the self - absorption is more pronounced at the position of the dust peak , where the ( 10 ) optical depth is largest , we conclude that the weak component is likely to be optically thin across the whole tmc1c core .",
    "thus , in the case of ( 10 ) self  absorption , we used the weak hyperfine component , divided by 1/27 ( its relative intensity compared to the sum , normalized to unity , of the seven hyperfines ) , to determine the ( 10 ) integrated intensity , line width , and , as shown in sec .",

    "based on hyperfine fits to the c@xmath11o(10 ) transition and a comparison of the relative strengths of the three components , we see that the c@xmath11o(10 ) emission is optically thin throughout tmc1c .",
    "although the noise is generally too high in the c@xmath11o(21 ) data to make indisputable hyperfine fits , the results of such an attempt suggest that the c@xmath11o(21 ) lines are also optically thin , which is expected for thin c@xmath11o(10 ) emission and temperatures of @xmath1710 k. thus , the integrated intensity maps of  lines will reflect the  column density distribution .    in order to estimate the optical depth of the c@xmath12o(21 ) lines , we compare the integrated intensity of c@xmath12o(21 ) to that of c@xmath11o(21 ) .",

    "ammonia observations have shown that tmc1c is a coherent core , having a constant line width across the core at a value slightly higher than the thermal width , and increasing outside the `` coherent '' radius , @xmath170.1 pc @xcite .",
    "our n@xmath5h@xmath6  observations of tmc1c show that the line width remains constant , at a value @xmath172 times higher than the thermal line width , over the entire core ( see fig .",
    "[ fwhmbins ] for a map of the line width and a plot of line width vs. radius ) , though the dispersion in the n@xmath5h@xmath6  line width is very large .",
    "this result is in agreement with the nh@xmath24 observations of tmc1c , and is not consistent with the decreasing n@xmath5h@xmath6  and n@xmath5d@xmath6  linewidths at larger radii seen in l1544 and l694 - 2 , which in other important ways ( density and temperature structure , velocity asymmetry seen in ( 10 ) ) closely resemble tmc1c . to make sure that the lack of correlation of the ( 10 ) line width is not due to geometric effects , considering the elongated structure of tmc1c , we also plotted the ( 10 ) line width as a function of antenna temperature , and found similar results .",
    "this behavior may be due to the coherence of the central portion of the core , which has nearly constant length along the line of sight , and thus the velocity dispersion comes from regions of the core that have similar scales ( see fig . 4 in goodman et al .",
    "cores formed by compressions in a supersonic turbulent flow naturally develop these regions of constant length at their centers @xcite . another reason that the n@xmath5h@xmath6  line widths appear constant across the cloud could be the different `` infall '' velocity profile , with the velocity peaking farther away from the dust peak than in l1544 and l694 - 2 ( though the projected velocity would still be at its maximum at the dust peak ) . in the case of l1544",
    ", @xcite showed that the ( 10 ) line profile is consistent with the @xcite model at a certain time in the cloud evolution , where the `` infall '' velocity profile peaks at a radius of about 3,000 au ( see also myers 2005 for alternative models with similar radial velocities ) .",
    "indeed , in sec .  [ infall ]",
    "we show that the extent of the asymmetry seen in ( 10 ) suggests that the peak of the inward motions is at about 7,000 au , so that one does not expect to see broader line widths within this radius .",
    "in fact , the binned data in fig .  [ fwhmbins ] show a hint of a peak at about 50  ( 7000 au at the distance of taurus ) .    in order to compare the thermal and non - thermal line widths in tmc-1c",
    ", we assume that the gas temperature is equal to 10 k and use the formulae :    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the molecular weight of the species and @xmath28 is the mass of hydrogen .",
    "figure [ fwhmratio ] shows the non - thermal line width plotted against the thermal line width at the position of the dust column density peak . to allow a fair comparison ,",
    "all the data in the figure have been first spatially smoothed at the same resolution of the map ( 1 ) . although c@xmath11o , c@xmath12o , dco@xmath6  and n@xmath5h@xmath6  all have similar molecular weights , they have significantly different values for their non - thermal line widths .",
    "the thermal line width is much smaller than the non - thermal line width for the molecules c@xmath11o  and c@xmath12o , while the ratio is closer to unity for dco@xmath6  and n@xmath5h@xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the isotopologues of co are tracing material at larger distances from the center , with a larger turbulent line width , than are dco@xmath6  and n@xmath5h@xmath6 , which presumably are tracing the higher density material closer to the center of tmc-1c .",
    "the c@xmath12o(21 ) line is slightly thick , and this is probably the reason of its slightly larger line width when compared to the thin c@xmath11o(21 ) line , as shown in figure [ fwhmratio ] .",
    "for each transition observed , we see no clear correlation between the observed line width and the thermal line width ( and therefore with temperature , column density and distance from the peak column density , see section [ dustcolumn ] ) . as in the study of depletion , the lower signal to noise in c@xmath13s(21 ) , dco@xmath6(21 ) and dco@xmath6(32 ) make any possible trends between @xmath29 and @xmath30 more difficult to determine . from fig .",
    "[ fwhmratio ] we note that nh@xmath24 and n@xmath5h@xmath6  have similar non - thermal line widths , which makes sense given that  and  are expected to trace similar material ( e.g. benson et al .",

    "we finally note that the line widths that we measure in c@xmath11o  and c@xmath12o  are larger than the n@xmath5h@xmath6  linewidths throughout tmc1c , which contrasts with the results seen in c@xmath12o  and n@xmath5h@xmath6  in b68 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that tmc1c , unlike b68 , is embedded in a molecular cloud complex and it is not an isolated core .",

[ fchem ] .",
    "note that despite the similar binding energies of co and , the  and drops are steeper than those of  and , which is due to the fact that the co freeze  out ( although lower than in l1544 ) enhances the  production rate , as pointed out by previous chemical models @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the co depletion factor _ within _ the cloud , @xmath135(co)(co ) , used here to indicate the co depletion _ within _ the cloud , should not be confused with @xmath136(co ) , the _ observed _ ( or integrated - along - the - line - of - site ) co depletion factor ( @xmath136 = @xmath137 ; see also crapsi et al .",
    "2004 ) . ] , is significantly lower than in l1544 at radii @xmath138 5,000 au , which reflects the different density profile ( see right bottom panel in fig .  [ fchem ] ) .",
    "the present data , together with previous work , show that there are significant chemical variations among apparently similar cloud cores and that co is not always heavily depleted when the volume density becomes larger than a few @xmath210@xmath3  ( as found in l1544 , l1498 and l1517b ; caselli et al .",
    "2002 , tafalla et al . 2002 , 2004 ) . indeed , the case of l1521e , a taurus starless core , where the central density is 10@xmath85  but",
    "no co freeze  out is observed @xcite , suggests that cloud cores in similar dynamical stages can have different chemical compositions .",
    "this point has been further discussed by @xcite , who underline the importance of the environment in setting the chemical / dynamical stage of a core , so that a core like l1521e ( and l1689b ) may have experienced a recent contraction phase , where the chemistry has not yet had the time to adjust to the new physical structure . on the other hand , the bok globule b68 , being close to equilibrium , may have achieved the present structure a long time ago , so that both co and  had time to freeze  out ( as found by @xcite ) .",
    "the present detailed study of tmc1c adds a new piece to the puzzle : cores which are currently accreting material from the surrounding cloud appear chemically younger , with lower co depletion factors . if the accreting cloud material , at densities @xmath13810@xmath3 , is old enough ( @xmath139 yr ) to have formed observable abundances of  ( as in tmc1c ) , then  lines toward the dust peak will be bright . on the other hand , the chemical structure of cores such as l1521e ( rich in co , but poor in n  bearing species such as  and ) may be understood as young condensations which are accreting either lower density material ( where the chemical times scales for  formation are significantly longer ) or material which spent only a small fraction of 10@xmath85 yr at relatively high densities ( @xmath1710@xmath3 ) .",
    "the former hypothesis may be valid in environments less massive than those associated with tmc1c ( and it does not require large contraction speeds ) , whereas the latter hypothesis needs dynamical time scales shorter than or at most comparable to chemical time scales ( which are about 10@xmath3 yr at densities of @xmath1710@xmath85 , as can be found from the freeze  out time scale of species such as co ) .    in summary , tmc-1c",
    ", being more massive than l1544 and other typical low - mass cores , has a _ larger reservoir _ of undepleted material at densities close to 10@xmath3 , where both co and  are abundant .",
    "detailed chemical models suggest that tmc1c must be at least @xmath140  yr old , to reproduce the observed abundances across the cloud .",
    "our simple chemical code tell us that the observed co depletion factors can be reached in only 10,000 yr .",
    "therefore , the core nucleus is either significantly younger than the surrounding material or the surrounding ( undepleted ) material has accreted toward the core nucleus in the past 10,000 yr . in either case , this is evidence that _ the densest part of tmc1c has recently accreted material_.    from the velocity gradients presented in section [ svel ] it is hard to see a clear pattern of flowing material towards the dust peak , but the `` chaotic '' pattern is reminiscent of a turbulent flow that may be funnelling towards the densest region , aided by gravity . in any case , the extended inward motions deduced from  observations ( see sect .  [ infall ] ) is consistent with material at about ( 510)@xmath210@xmath4  _ currently accreting _ toward the dust peak position at velocities around 0.1",
    ". it will be extremely important to compare this velocity field with those predicted by turbulent simulations of molecular cloud evolution , especially considering the possibility of competitive accretion ( bonnell & bate 2006 ) .",
    "observation of cs will also be important to check our prediction of a larger `` extended infall '' velocity , when compared to l1544 .",
    "a detailed observational study of the starless core tmc1c , embedded in the taurus molecular cloud , has been carried out with the iram 30 m antenna .",
    "we have determined that tmc-1c is a relatively young core ( t @xmath139 yr ) , with evidence of material accreting toward the core nucleus ( located at the dust emission peak ) . the core material at densities @xmath14110@xmath85  is embedded in a cloud condensation with total mass of about 14 m@xmath142 and average density of @xmath110@xmath3 , where co is mostly in the gas phase and  had the time to reach the observed abundances of @xmath110@xmath10 .",
    "the overall structure is suggestive of ongoing inflow of material toward the central condensation .",
    "in addition , we have found that :    \\1 .",
    "( 10 ) lines show signs of inward asymmetry over a region of about 7,000 au in radius .",
    "this is the most extended inward asymmetry observed in  so far .",
    "the data are consistent with simple two  layer models , where the line - of - sight component of the relative ( infall ) velocities range from @xmath170.15  ( toward the dust peak ) to @xmath170.05  ( at a distance from the dust peak of about 7,000 au ) .    \\2 .",
    "co isotopologues and  show increasing depletion as @xmath143 increases and @xmath78 decreases .",
    "the amount of co depletion that we observe is a factor of @xmath175 lower than that of l1544 , whereas  column densities are only a factor of two lower .",
    "also ,  show clear signs of moderate depletion toward the dust peak position .",
    "the gas temperature determined from ( 21 ) is 12  k at the dust peak , indicating that co is not tracing the dense ( @xmath144 ) and cold ( @xmath145 10  k ) regions of dense cores .",
    "the ( 21 ) excitation temperature drops outside the dust peak , and this is consistent with a roughly constant kinetic temperature and a dropping volume density ( _ traced by co isotopologues _ ) from @xmath146  toward the dust peak to @xmath147  at a projected distance from the dust peak of about 11,000  au ( no high s / n data are available to probe larger size scales ) .",
    "n@xmath5h@xmath6(1 - 0 ) line widths are constant across the core , which is consistent with previous nh@xmath24 measurements @xcite , but different from what has been found with n@xmath5h@xmath6  and n@xmath5d@xmath6  observations of l1544 and l1521f @xcite , where line widths are increasing toward the core center .",
    "the increase in line width with radius seen in c@xmath12o  and n@xmath5h@xmath6  in b68 @xcite is not seen in tmc1c , and unlike b68 , the c@xmath12o  line width is significantly larger than the n@xmath5h@xmath6  line width throughout tmc-1c .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that tmc1c , unlike b68 , is embedded in a molecular cloud complex , so that co lines trace more material along the line of sight of tmc1c .",
    "the velocity field that we see in tmc1c does not show the global signs of rotation that were seen in nh@xmath24 observations over a somewhat different area at arcminute resolution in @xcite . nevertheless , one portion of tmc1c encompassing the dust peak position does have a more coherent velocity field , suggestive of solid body rotation with magnitude @xmath14 pc@xmath16 , in the tracers c@xmath11o(1 - 0 ) , c@xmath11o(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath12o(2 - 1 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "the observed chemical structure of the tmc1c core can be reproduced with a simple chemical model , adopting the co and n@xmath5 binding energies recently measured in the laboratory .",
    "we argue here that `` chemically young and physically evolved '' cores like l1521e and l1698b ( those with low co depletion , faint  lines , central densities above @xmath148 @xmath14 and centrally concentrated structure ) have lower density envelopes than tmc1c in which the abundance did not have the time to reach equilibrium values . on the other hand , `` chemically and physically evolved cores '' like l1544 , l694 - 2 and l183 ( those with high co depletion and bright  lines ) are likely to have lower rates of accretion of material from the envelope to the nucleus than in tmc1c ( or it has ended ) , and with a core nucleus undergoing contraction .",
    "finally , `` chemically evolved '' but less centrally concentrated cores ( e.g. l1498 , l1512 , b68 ) , can just be older objects ( age @xmath149 yr ) , close to equilibrium , as suggested by lada et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in the case of tmc1c",
    ", there is evidence that the core is at least @xmath150 yr old and has recently accreted less chemically evolved material .",
    "more comprehensive chemical models , taking into account the accretion of chemically young material , as well as a comparison between the observed velocity patterns and turbulent models of cloud core formation are sorely needed to test our conclusions .",
