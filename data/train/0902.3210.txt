    "wireless operators are in the process of augmenting the macrocell network with supplemental infrastructure such as microcells , distributed antennas and relays .",
    "an alternative with lower upfront costs is to improve indoor coverage and capacity using the concept of _ end - consumer _ installed femtocells or home base stations@xcite .",
    "a femtocell is a low power , short range ( @xmath1 meters ) wireless data access point ( ap ) , functioning in service provider owned licensed spectrum , which provides in - building coverage to home users and transports the user traffic over internet based backhaul such as cable modem .",
    "because of the proximity of users to their aps , femtocells provide higher spatial reuse of spectrum and cause less interference to other users . the spatial reuse ( in @xmath2 )",
    "is readily expressible by the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) @xcite which is a measure of the total obtainable network throughput per unit hz per unit area .",
    "previous studies@xcite have shown a nearly @xmath3x improvement in overall spatial reuse when moving from a macrocell - only network to a two - tier underlay with @xmath4 femtocells per cellsite .",
    "in addition to improved spatial reuse , cellular operators desire to operate both cellular and indoor femtocell users in the same bandwidth ( termed _ universal frequency reuse _ ) , as is assumed in this paper , for cost effectiveness and flexible deployment @xcite . with shared spectrum ,",
    "practical challenges stem from the absence of coordination across tiers @xcite due to scalability issues . because femtocells are consumer deployed in their self - interest and because of reasons of security and limited backhaul capacity , these femtocells will potentially offer privileged coverage only to licensed , subscribed indoor users .",
    "this paper assumes _ closed access _ ( ca ) , which means only licensed home users within radio range can communicate with their own femtocell .",
    "the drawback of such a co - channel closed access deployment of femtocells is that cross - tier interference becomes the capacity - limiting factor .",
    "for example , a cellular user located at the edge of their macrocell may experience unacceptable interference from an actively transmitting femtocell in vicinity .",
    "commercial femtocell offerings ( such as verizon s `` home network expander '' ) provide both public access and closed access operation which are user configurable .",
    "our results provide a networkwide performance benchmark in a closed access setting .",
    "the motivation behind this paper is to understand how exploiting the available degrees of freedom through multiple antenna transmission influences coverage and spatial reuse in a two - tier network with universal frequency reuse .",
    "we consider both single - user ( su ) multiple antenna transmission and multiuser ( mu ) multiple antenna transmission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twotiermutransmission ] ) employed by the macrocell basestation ( bs ) and femtocell aps .",
    "array gain resulting from su transmission provides robustness against cross - tier interference .",
    "multiuser transmission , on the other hand , increases the number of simultaneous transmissions at the expense of reduced signal strength per user terminal and potential inter - user interference .",
    "given a multiple antenna transmission strategy ( su or mu ) , let @xmath5 denote the maximum density ( in femtocells per square meter ) of simultaneously transmitting femtocells  denoted as the _ maximum femtocell contention density _  that guarantees a certain minimum per - tier quality of service ( qos ) requirement . given a certain minimum per - tier target signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) equaling @xmath6 , the qos requirement stipulates that the instantaneous sir at each user should exceed @xmath6 with a probability of at least @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a design parameter .",
    "since the signal power for a cellular user decays as @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the distance from the macrocell bs and @xmath11 is the outdoor path loss exponent ) , satisfying its qos requirement requires @xmath12 to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , satisfying the qos requirement for a femtocell user at @xmath10 necessitates @xmath12 to be monotonically decreasing as @xmath13 .",
    "this paper characterizes near - far effects and the resulting per - tier coverage by defining two quantities of interest namely the _ no - coverage femtocell radius _ and the _ cellular coverage radius_. the no - coverage femtocell radius @xmath14 determines the minimum sir feasible femtocell distance from the macrocell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : femtomacro_coverageradii ] ) . any femtocell user within @xmath15 meters from the macrocell experiences an outage probability greater than @xmath8 due to excessive cellular interference .",
    "this suggests that any user at @xmath16 should communicate with the macrocell because of its potentially higher cellular sir .",
    "the cellular coverage radius @xmath17 denotes the maximum sir feasible distance from the macrocell up to which a cellular user can satisfy its outage probability constraint in the presence of hotspot interference . since there is no coordination between tiers for managing interference , providing greater spatial reuse using femtocells trades off the coverage radii and vice - versa . because the cellular network serves as the primary network to mobile outdoor users",
    ", it is desirable to maximize @xmath17 in the presence of hotspot interference .    assuming that each tier employs either transmit beamforming ( bf ) [ for su transmission ] or linear zero - forcing precoding [ for mu transmission ] with transmission powers @xmath18 and @xmath19 in each resource ( eg . frequency sub - band )",
    ", this work poses the following questions :    * what is the maximum femtocell contention density @xmath12 as a function of the location @xmath10 with respect to ( w.r.t ) the macrocell bs , the ratio @xmath20 , the transmission strategy ( su vs. mu transmission ) , the number of transmit antennas per macrocell bs and femtocell ap , the target per - tier sir @xmath6 , the maximum outage probability @xmath8 and the path loss exponents ?",
    "* given an average of @xmath21 transmitting femtocells per cell - site , how much cellular coverage can the macrocell bs provide to its users ? * how does the no - coverage femtocell radius vary with su and mu transmission strategies ? *",
    "how should femtocells adapt their transmission power for ensuring reliable cellular coverage ?",
    "prior research in tiered networks have mainly considered an operator planned underlay of a macrocell with single / multiple microcells@xcite .",
    "a microcell has a much larger radio range ( 100 - 500 m ) than a femtocell , and generally implies centralized deployment , i.e. by the service - provider .",
    "this allows the operator to either load balance users or preferentially assign high data rate cellular users to the microcell @xcite because of its inherently larger capacity .",
    "in contrast , femtocells are consumer installed and the traffic requirements at femtocells are user determined without any operator influence . consequently , decentralized strategies for interference management may be preferred@xcite .",
    "the subject of this work is related to huang _ _ et al.__@xcite which derives per - tier transmission capacities with spectrum underlay and spectrum overlay .",
    "in contrast to their work which assumes relay - assisted cell - edge users , our work proposes to improve coverage by regulating femtocell transmit powers .",
    "et al.__@xcite have derived transmission capacities in an _ ad hoc _ network with spatial diversity .",
    "our work has extended this analysis to a cellular - underlaid _ ad hoc _ network .",
    "finally , related works on cognitive radios ( cr ) include ( but not restricted to )    analyzing sensing - throughput tradeoffs@xcite for computing optimal sensing time by cr users and    limit transmit powers of cr users@xcite    .",
    "the differentiating aspect of our work is a decentralized femtocell transmit power selection scheme which ensures a per - tier outage probability below a desired threshold .",
    "given @xmath22 antennas at the macrocell bs and @xmath23 antennas per femtocell ap , a maximum tolerable per - tier outage probability @xmath8 and path loss exponents @xmath11 ( outdoor cellular transmission ) and @xmath24 ( during indoor - to - outdoor femtocell transmission ) respectively , this work provides the following contributions .",
    "we derive coverage zones wherein cross - tier interference prevents users in each tier from satisfying their qos requirements .",
    "single - user macrocell transmission is shown to increase the cellular coverage radius by a factor @xmath25 relative to mu transmission .",
    "single - user femtocell transmission is shown to decrease the no - coverage femtocell radius @xmath14 by a factor of @xmath26 relative to mu femtocell transmission .",
    "this suggests that su transmission results in superior coverage in either tier .",
    "we also show that femtocell performance is regulated by cellular interference and hotspot interference is negligible in comparison .",
    "we derive the maximum femtocell contention density @xmath27 at distance @xmath10 from the macrocell bs .",
    "two distinct operating regimes are shown namely a    cellular - limited regime , wherein femtocell users are primarily affected by cellular interference and    hotspot - limited regime wherein both cellular and hotspot users are affected by hotspot interference    .",
    "regime 1 determines the coverage provided to femtocell users , while regime 2 determines @xmath27 and the cellular coverage radius . in regime 2 , su macrocell transmission is shown to increase @xmath27 by a factor of @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the gamma function ) relative to mu transmission .",
    "femtocells maximize their area spectral efficiency by choosing their transmission strategy depending on @xmath24 , with su transmission being desirable with considerable hotspot interference ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this suggests that per - tier su transmission is preferable from a spatial reuse perspective .",
    "we propose a carrier - sensing approach in which a femtocell chooses its transmit power depending on its distance from the macrocell bs for minimizing cross - tier interference .",
    "this strategy provides reliable cellular coverage with up to 60 femtocells per cell site ( with typical cellular parameters ) .",

    "<S> in two - tier networks  comprising a conventional cellular network overlaid with shorter range hotspots ( e.g. femtocells , distributed antennas , or wired relays )  with universal frequency reuse , the near - far effect from cross - tier interference creates dead spots where reliable coverage can not be guaranteed to users in either tier . equipping the macrocell and femtocells with multiple antennas enhances robustness against the near - far problem . </S>",
    "<S> this work derives the maximum number of simultaneously transmitting multiple antenna femtocells meeting a per - tier outage probability constraint . </S>",
    "<S> coverage dead zones are presented wherein cross - tier interference bottlenecks cellular and femtocell coverage . </S>",
    "<S> two operating regimes are shown namely 1 ) a cellular - limited regime in which femtocell users experience unacceptable cross - tier interference and 2 ) a hotspot - limited regime wherein both femtocell users and cellular users are limited by hotspot interference . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis accounts for the per - tier transmit powers , the number of transmit antennas ( single antenna transmission being a special case ) and terrestrial propagation such as the rayleigh fading and the path loss exponents . </S>",
    "<S> single - user ( su ) multiple antenna transmission at each tier is shown to provide significantly superior coverage and spatial reuse relative to multiuser ( mu ) transmission . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a decentralized carrier - sensing approach to regulate femtocell transmission powers based on their location . considering a worst - case cell - edge location , </S>",
    "<S> simulations using typical path loss scenarios show that our interference management strategy provides reliable cellular coverage with about @xmath0 femtocells per cellsite . </S>"
