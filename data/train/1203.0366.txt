    "infectious diseases have caused tremendous losses in human health and lives and they remain as a serious threat to mankind today . to resist infectious disease ,",
    "theoretical investigations have been engaged to study the epidemic behaviors @xcite and immunization strategies were suggested to prevent epidemic spreading when vaccine resources are limited @xcite .",
    "recently , large - scale agent - based simulations have been applied to get more detailed descriptions of disease outbreaks @xcite .",
    "a prominent development among these studies was to abstract the complex social relations into networks , where nodes represent individuals and links represent the contacts among them .",
    "it is found that the basic reproductive number @xmath0 , a key factor determining whether a disease can spread out or not , depends strongly on the variance of the distribution of the contacts @xcite .",
    "extensive results show that the social contacts typically have a fat - tail degree distribution where a small number of people have very large number of contacts @xcite .",
    "this property typically leads to a much higher @xmath0 than that in a network with the same average degree but homogeneous degree distribution @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial features of social networks such as small - world property and fat - tail degree distribution , and the complexity of the dynamics of infectious diseases , lead to some interesting properties of epidemic spreading .",
    "for example , it is found that for a linearly growing network , the evolution of the number of the infected nodes has oscillatory behaviors when the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model is adopted @xcite .",
    "an adaptive mechanism is studied in @xcite , where a susceptible individual may avoid the contacts with his infected neighbors and rewire these contacts to other susceptible individuals .",
    "an important observation is that the interplay of the epidemic dynamics and the network topology may cause a bi - stable phenomenon .",
    "that is , the disease is hard to persist when the infection density is low , yet may enter endemic state when the infection density is high .",
    "network growth is a fundamental property for any healthy systems @xcite and adaptive changes widely exist in most systems when in face of infection .",
    "adaptations to avoid an undesirable outcome can sometimes postpone the onset of the undesirable outcome , at the same time making it more severe @xcite .",
    "hence it is necessary to study the influences of both network growth and adaptive dynamics to the dynamics of epidemic spreading .    in this paper , we study the epidemic spreading in linearly growing networks assuming that the susceptible nodes may break the contacts with the infected nodes .",
    "considering the fact that in general an individual can not survive when s / he is fully isolated in a modern society , the contact breaking process takes place only when both of the two end nodes of a contact still have other neighbors .",
    "interestingly , we observe an epidemic reemergence phenomenon , where the number of infected nodes may stay at a low level for a long time and then bursts up to a high level .",
    "the process may repeat for a long time before the disease finally dies out . in sec .",
    "ii we present the epidemic model .",
    "simulation results are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we give some theoretical analysis to explain our observations .",
    "v presents some further discussion and concludes the paper .",
    "consider a barabasi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite with @xmath1 nodes as the initial network , where the average nodal degree @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the number of links attached by each newly added node .",
    "we use the sis model to describe the epidemiological process , which is widely adopted to describe infectious diseases @xcite . in this",
    "model agents can be in two distinct states : susceptible or infected .",
    "a susceptible agent may get infected if he has infected neighbor(s ) .",
    "suppose a susceptible node has neighbors , of which @xmath4 are infected , and the probability of having contagion with each infected neighbor is @xmath5 .",
    "then the susceptible node may get infected with probability @xmath6 which is approximately @xmath7 when @xmath5 is small . at the same time",
    ", each infected agent will become susceptible at a rate of @xmath8 . in this paper , we set @xmath9 unless otherwise specified .",
    "we first consider the case in which the network is continually growing during epidemic spreading .",
    "assume on average there are @xmath10 susceptible nodes joining the networks at each time step and each new node brings @xmath3 links connected to the existing nodes in a preferential attachment manner .",
    "we assume that the newly added nodes know the infectious states of the existing nodes .",
    "thus they only connect to susceptible ones .",
    "the probability that a susceptible node @xmath11 is connected to a newly added node is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the degree of the susceptible node @xmath11 .",
    "such a network growth model has also been adopted in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : growing ] shows the relation between the fraction of infected nodes @xmath14 after transient process and the disease transmission probability @xmath5 for different values of @xmath10 . in this figure ,",
    "all the curves overlap completely .",
    "therefore , the fraction of infected nodes will not be influenced when we change the network growing rate .",
    "now we consider the case that susceptible nodes may remove their links connected to infected nodes when the network is not growing .",
    "specifically , in each time step each susceptible node may break the link connected to an infected neighbor at a probability @xmath15 . considering that an individual seldom can go isolation in a modern society , we set the constraint that a link removal can happen only when both of the two end nodes of the link have other neighbors .",
    "we term such a constraint as _",
    "isolation avoidance_. obviously , without isolation avoidance , the link removal process can finally lead the network to a disease - free status , since it is equivalent to reducing the effective infection rate @xcite , in the extreme case to zero when all the links to the infected nodes are removed . with the isolation avoidance , however , the link removal process can not guarantee the clearance of the disease , since the mechanism lets each node retain at least one connection and a disease may spread out in the condition of @xmath16 as the reproductive number @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig : breaking ] shows the evolution of the number of infected nodes for the cases with and without isolation avoidance , respectively .",
    "the infectious disease disappears after a transient process when the isolation avoidance mechanism is not considered .",
    "however , when the isolation avoidance is adopted , the number of infected nodes may remain at a low level rather than disappear .",
    "next we consider the case in a growing network where susceptible nodes may remove their links connected to infected nodes without isolation avoidance .",
    "figure [ fig : growing&breaking ] shows the evolution of the number of infected nodes , @xmath18 , with different parameters .",
    "it shows that network growing rate @xmath10 does not have significant influence to epidemic dynamics ; and in all the cases , the infection will finally either go extinction or stay at a low level .",
    "finally we study the case in which network growth , link removal process and the mechanism of isolation avoidance are all involved .",
    "interestingly , we observe the phenomenon of epidemic reemergence .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : growing&breaking&isolationavoidance ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the number of infected nodes stays at a low level for a long time , then suddenly bursts up to a high level before decays to a low level again .",
    "this process may repeat a certain times before the infection finally dies out .",
    "this observation can be explained as follows : on one hand , the link removal process can suppress the epidemic spreading , while the isolation avoidance lets each node have at least one neighbor .",
    "the interplay between these two processes makes the number of infected nodes remain at a low level . on the other hand ,",
    "the newly added nodes connect to susceptible nodes when they join the network . due to the small number of infected nodes and the isolation avoidance",
    ", the infection can not easily reach these newly added nodes . therefore , the newly added nodes can cumulate , connecting susceptible nodes into a large component .",
    "once the infection invades into this component , however , the infection size can quickly burst up .",
    "to reveal the mechanism of the epidemic reemergence in more detail , we illustrate the evolution of the number of infected nodes in the giant component , @xmath23 , the size of giant component , @xmath24 , and the number of components , @xmath25 , respectively , in figure [ fig : detailedevolution ] .",
    "refer to figure [ fig : growing&breaking&isolationavoidance ] , we can see that when the number of the infected nodes @xmath18 is very small , the size of the giant component increases linearly along time and @xmath23 is about zero .",
    "this means that the giant component is basically in the disease - free status .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath25 decreases along time , meaning that the newly added nodes continually merge the existing components into larger ones .",
    "however , once the disease invades into the giant component , the infection may quickly spread over the whole component , leading to a high value of @xmath23",
    ". then the component quickly breaks into small pieces due to the link removals , evidenced by an increasing number of @xmath25 .",
    "the growth of a large giant component plays an important role in inducing the reemergence phenomenon . for a component that is totally composed of susceptible nodes , referred as s - component",
    ", the size of it may keep grow during the network growing process .",
    "however , if a newly added node connects the s - component to a component containing infected nodes , referred as i - component , the infection may reach the s - component by going through the newly added node .",
    "if the size of the s - component is small , it may not make a large impact when it is infected .",
    "when a large s - component is infected , however , the disease may quickly spread over it , causing a sharp increase in the number of infected nodes .",
    "it is interesting to have a closer look at how the small i - components survive the long inter - epidemic periods and how the infection finally invades a large s - component ( in most cases , the giant component ) .",
    "we take the second explosion which happens at around @xmath26 as an example . at @xmath27 , there are totally @xmath28 infected nodes left in the network and they belong to @xmath29 i - components .",
    "one of these i - components is an 18-node star network which is composed of @xmath30 infected nodes including the hub of the star and @xmath31 susceptible nodes .",
    "this explains how the infection remains endemic : the links in the i - component can not be removed due to isolation avoidance . at @xmath32 , the 18-node i - component is connected to the giant component through one of its susceptible nodes .",
    "a few time steps later the infection invades the giant component , leading to an epidemic .",
    "in fact , similar observations apply to all the other epidemics : the long - lived i - components seeding the epidemics almost always have star or star - like topologies .",
    "the isolation avoidance mechanism prevents such i - components from being further fragmented .",
    "the infection therefore has a chance to survive over a long time .",
    "finally , by chance the i - component may be connected to the giant / big s - component , which may lead to an explosion .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot ] illustrates snapshots of network structures right before and after an epidemic explosion .",
    "specifically , when @xmath26 which is just before the epidemic explosion , as we can see in figure [ fig : snapshot](a ) , there is a giant component containing most of the network nodes and all the nodes in this component are susceptible .",
    "meanwhile , a small number of infected nodes exist in several small components .",
    "this observation is accordant with our previous discussion that due to the network growth and isolation avoidance , the network can form a giant component which is basically disease free , while a small number of infected nodes may remain in small clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot](b ) shows the network structure when @xmath33 which is right after the epidemic explosion .",
    "we see that the network breaks into many small pieces , most of which with no more than @xmath29 nodes . in this stage , on one hand , the network still has many infected nodes , thus some i - components may be further decomposed to suppress the infection spreading ; on the other hand , the network has several s - components with relatively large size , which indicates that the new giant component starts to form .",
    "note that a reconnection between an i - component and the giant / big s - component does _ not _ always lead to an explosion .",
    "in fact , in most cases , the giant / big component is finally disconnected from any infected nodes again without any noticeable increase in the number of infected nodes in between .",
    "an explosion typically only happens when the infection manages to reach a high - degree hub in the giant component . in the next section",
    ", we will show in more detail the strong randomness in the reconnection process .",
    "now we do some theoretical analysis to explain the observations in the simulation . we start with the status that the network has just suffered from a large - scale infection and the susceptible nodes have cut off a large number of connections to protect themselves . consequently , the network is broken into pieces .",
    "in such situation , though most nodes have recovered to susceptible status , due to the isolation avoidance , there are still a small number of infected nodes remaining in the network . because the number of infected nodes and the number of the corresponding i - components are very small",
    ", the probability that a newly added node connects to a susceptible node belonging to an i - component is low .",
    "hence , to study the growing speed of the giant component , we can ignore the effects of the infected nodes and the corresponding i - components . upon obtaining the growing behavior of the giant component",
    ", we can then calculate the expected time that the giant component is connected to an i - component .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath34 nodes and @xmath35 links remaining in a network just suffered from a large - scale infection .",
    "therefore on average each node has a degree @xmath36 .",
    "denote the average component size as @xmath37 .",
    "we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the size of component @xmath40 and @xmath41 the number of the components . since the probability that a new node connects to a component is proportional to the number of links remaining in the component and most nodes in the small components are of very low and similar nodal degrees , approximately the probability that a new node connects to a component is proportional to the size of this component .",
    "therefore the average size of the components , other than the giant one , that are chosen by a new node is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "ideally , if a new node connects to only a single node in the giant component and connects to other @xmath44 nodes from other different components , the size of the giant component may be increased by @xmath45 . however , with the growing of the giant component , the probability of having the new node making multiple connections to the giant component increases .",
    "thus the giant component size may be increased at a speed of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the number of components connected to the new node other than the giant one , @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "we assume that each new node connects the giant component by at least one link when he joins the network .",
    "this assumption is reasonable : on one hand , when all components are of small sizes , a new node may not connect to the largest component at that time .",
    "however , since the new node connects a few small components into a larger one , the newly formed component stands a better chance to be connected to more new nodes arriving later and become even bigger . with the growing of the network , the newly formed component has a high chance to be finally included into the largest component .",
    "once this happens , the new node eventually contributes to increasing the size of the giant component . on the other hand ,",
    "when the giant component is large , the probability that it is connected to a new node is high .",
    "based on the above consideration , the evolution of the giant component size , denoted as @xmath24 , can be expressed as follows :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the elapsed time after the network breaks into pieces , @xmath51 is the sum of the degrees of all the nodes at time @xmath50 , and @xmath52 is the sum of the degrees of all the nodes in the giant component at time @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath53 equals the number of nodes when @xmath54 .",
    "the term in the first ( second ) bracket in the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsgdt ] ) indicates the probability that a link sourced from a new node does not ( does ) choose the giant component , in which the preferential attachment is adopted and the effects of i - components are ignored . for the case of @xmath22 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsgdt ] ) goes to @xmath55 solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsgdt - m=2 ] ) , we have @xmath56 where we set @xmath57 .    figure [ fig : sg ] shows the results of figure [ fig : detailedevolution](b ) in the range of @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath59 is around @xmath60 , the network breaks up to a large number of small pieces .",
    "after that the network grows continually until a giant component forms up . in this figure , the circles show the simulation results and the red solid curve shows the theoretical results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sg ] ) .",
    "we can see they match fairly well .",
    "following we analyze the average duration when the giant component can keep growing without getting connected to an i - component . denote @xmath61 as the probability that the giant component connects to i - component for the first time at time @xmath62 .",
    "we have    @xmath63    where @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta ] ) , @xmath65 is the number of susceptible nodes in the i - components which does not change a lot during the network growing process until the infection invades the giant component , and hence is treated as a constant value here .",
    "the first ( second ) term on the right - hand side indicates the probability that none of the @xmath3 links of the new node connects to the i - components ( giant component ) , while the third term indicates the probability that none of the @xmath3 links connects to either the i - components or the giant component .",
    "therefore , @xmath66 presents the probability that a node newly added at time @xmath50 does not connect any i - component to the giant component .",
    "as @xmath10 is the growing rate of the new nodes , @xmath67 represents the probability that all the newly added nodes do not connect any i - component to the giant component at time @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the expected value of the time that the giant component gets connected to an i - component for the first time is @xmath68 which can be simplified to @xmath69    setting @xmath70 , which is obtained from the simulation , and all the other parameters the same as those in figure [ fig : sg ] , we substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : sg ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : compactedexpectedtime ] ) and then solve it numerically .",
    "the result is @xmath71 . using similar method",
    ", we can calculate the standard deviation as @xmath72 .",
    "the very large standard deviation shows that there exist strong fluctuations in the time intervals between reconnections of i - component and the giant component . to demonstrate such strong fluctuations , we plot in figure [ fig : jumps ] the evolution of the overall size of all the i - components represented by the thin red curve .",
    "it is easy to understand that the overall infection size would jump up when a small i - component is connected to the giant component ( which makes the giant component itself an i - component , evidenced by the heights of the jumps closing to the size of the giant component ) .",
    "as we can see , after the transient process , several jumps take place at around time @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 and the time intervals in between are @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "such results are accordant with our theoretical estimation on the expected value of time interval and its deviation .",
    "the observation on the large deviation value has its significance : the strong fluctuations of the reconnection process make it difficult to predict when the next reconnection of an i - component and the giant component would happen though we could estimate the long - term average of the intervals .",
    "further consider the fact that a reconnection ( reflected as a peak of the thin red curve in figure [ fig : jumps ] ) does not always lead to an explosion ( a peak of thick black curve in figure [ fig : jumps ] ) , it would be very difficult , if not impossible , to predict when a reemergence would happen .",
    "once the infection does invade the giant component , the disease may spread over the whole component very quickly and further transmit to other smaller components .",
    "in fact , in the beginning stage of the outbreak , the fraction of infected nodes grows exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "specifically , with mean - field approximation the evolution of @xmath14 and @xmath80 can be expressed as    @xmath81    here we ignore the network growing process since we mainly focus on the drastic change of the infection size in which the time span is short and the number of newly added nodes is very limited .",
    "since @xmath14 is very small in the beginning stage of epidemic explosion , we neglect the high - order terms of @xmath14 . besides , because of the small time interval during this process",
    ", we regard @xmath82 as a constant .",
    "thus , the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : didt&dkdt ] ) can be simplified as @xcite @xmath83 solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : didt - simplified ] ) , we have @xmath84 we see that @xmath85 grows exponentially , which proves that the number of infected can increase very quickly in a short time .",
    "figure [ fig : growing&breaking&isolationavoidance ] illustrates that after each infection peak , the number of infected nodes decreases gradually and this decreasing process sustains much longer than the increasing process . to study the behaviors of the decreasing process , we first consider the dynamics of @xmath85 during a short period of time where @xmath82 can be approximately regarded as a constant . solving the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : didt&dkdt ] ) by assuming @xmath82 as a constant , we have @xmath86 where @xmath87 .    the exponential function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i - kfixed ] ) reveals that the value of @xmath88 determines the typical time it takes for @xmath85 to go to the stable state for a constant value @xmath82 . a larger @xmath88 corresponds to a shorter time . for the specific case as shown in figures [ fig : growing&breaking&isolationavoidance ] and [ fig : jumps ] where @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath9 and @xmath20 , when @xmath85 starts to decrease , @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "this shows that the spreading process is much faster than link removal process .",
    "such observation allows us to simplify our analysis by considering the decreasing process as composed of a series of quasi - static processes .",
    "that is , we divide the decreasing process into a series of very short time intervals and regard each short interval as composed of two different parts : first some links are removed ; then @xmath85 quickly converges to a temporally stable state where @xmath91 for the updated value of @xmath82 . hence , suppose @xmath82 has a small change in each time interval as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a small positive quantity .",
    "we have @xmath94 by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : didt - quasistatic ] ) , the evolution of @xmath85 can be expressed as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a constant depending on the initial condition . as @xmath93 is of a very small positive value , @xmath85 can be further approximated as @xmath97 therefore , we have that approximately @xmath85 evolves inverse - proportionally with time @xmath59 after the infection peak . the log - log plot in figure [ fig : slope ]",
    "shows the simulation results of the evolution of the number of infected nodes @xmath18 after the first and second infection peaks for the case in figure [ fig : jumps ] , where the first ( second ) peak happens around the time @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath18 evolves approximately inverse proportionally with time when it decays from the peak .",
    "when the number of infected nodes decreases to a small value , it will become stable . in this stage ,",
    "the network breaks to an extent that the sizes of i - components are small enough so that the breaking process almost ceases due to the isolation avoidance .",
    "consequently a small number of infected nodes may be preserved in the i - components for a long time until the next epidemic explosion happens .",
    "it has been observed that epidemic reemergence may happen for a wide range of @xmath10 and @xmath3 . to manifest the influences of @xmath10 and @xmath3",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath100 to measure the burstiness of the epidemic reemergence , which is defined as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the maximum value of @xmath18 in the whole disease spreading process . a smaller value of @xmath100 corresponds to a more abrupt burst in the number of infected nodes .",
    "figure [ fig : grayplot ] shows the results of parameter @xmath100 on the @xmath103 plane .",
    "it can be seen that generally speaking slower network growing speed @xmath10 and smaller @xmath3 lead to smaller @xmath100 value .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as follows .",
    "having a higher network growing speed and more links added to the network by each newly added node makes the s - components connect to i - components in a larger probability ; consequently the susceptible nodes may get infected more easily .",
    "if a significant number of s - components are invaded by infection before they form into a large component , the reemergence shall become less bursty .",
    "note that in all our simulations , the infection finally dies out : small fluctuations at a very low infection size sooner or later will push the infection into extinction .",
    "reemergence can not be repeated forever unless it has a stable pool outside the system we have been considering .",
    "based on a simple model which captures basic characteristics of epidemic spreading , we revealed the mechanism of a new phenomenon - _ epidemic reemergence_. specifically , we considered the epidemic spreading in a growing network where a susceptible node may remove the link connecting to an infected neighbor .",
    "such link - removal process , however , is subject to the isolation avoidance constraint .",
    "it is observed that epidemic reemergence may happen in such a simple model : the number of infected nodes may be suppressed to a low level for a long time and then suddenly bursts into a high level .",
    "our findings indicate that an infectious disease may break out repeatedly , and between two explosions the disease may be incubated for a long time by a small number of carriers who are not connected to the main body of the society but are confined in a small area .",
    "the small number of disease carriers however stands a high chance to induce a large - scale epidemic explosion even when most people are intentionally avoiding the disease .    in the current model , si links",
    "are simply removed unless the removal will cause isolation . in real life , however , people may tend to enhance existing ss links or even build up new ones to make compensations to the social connections they have lost . for example , they may tend to spend more time with their family members while reducing social gatherings .",
    "how such `` rewiring '' operations and connection enhancements will affect the epidemic spreading and reemergence is of our future research interest ."
