    "the so - called 1/8 anomaly , namely , the anomalous suppression of superconductivity at @xmath0 ( the hole concentration per cu ) @xmath1 in the high-@xmath8 superconductors has attracted great interest in relation to the stripe correlations of spins and holes and also to the mechanism of the high-@xmath8 superconductivity . the 1/8 anomaly was discovered for the first time in la@xmath9ba@xmath10cuo@xmath11 ( lbaco)@xcite which underwent a structural phase transition from the orthorhombic mid - temperature ( omt ) phase ( space group : bmab ) to the tetragonal low - temperature ( tlt ) phase ( space group : p4@xmath12/ncm ) at a low temperature below 60 k.@xcite in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 ( lsco ) which remains in the omt phase even at low temperatures , on the other hand , the 1/8 anomaly is not so conspicuous .",

    "although the 1/8 anomaly has been found in the zn - free lnczo , no 1/8 anomaly has been observed in the excess - oxygen - doped lbico , as mentioned in section i.@xcite according to the stripe - pinning model , the reason may be as follows .",

    "lbico around @xmath15 has the tht structure where the cuo@xmath12 plane is flat .",
    "therefore , the dynamical stripes are hard to be statically stabilized , leading to no 1/8 anomaly in lbico .",

    "finally , we comment on the staging structure of the excess oxygen , which is known to be formed in the excess - oxygen - doped lco.@xcite in the present lnczo , however , no staging structure has been detected within the accuracy of the powder x - ray diffraction measurements .",

    "we have found the 1/8 anomaly in the excess - oxygen - doped lnczo , where the excess oxygen is doped by the electrochemical technique and the phase separation of the excess oxygen is suppressed .",
    "the 1/8 anomaly has become marked by the 1% substitution of zn for cu .",
