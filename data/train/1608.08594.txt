    "open clusters ( ocs ) are valuable tools in probing the galaxy s chemical evolution ( gce ) .",
    "they provide the opportunity to measure the chemical composition of the galaxy over distances of several kiloparsecs around the sun and over a fraction of the galactic disk s lifetime .",
    "clusters and unbound stellar associations are born in dense molecular clouds . an open cluster is comprised of stars of different masses but with very similar , if not identical , initial chemical compositions . over time , ocs dissolve and cluster members join the population of disk stars , already supplemented by stars from the unbound stellar associations @xcite .",
    "the possibility exists that the majority of field stars now in the galactic disk were born in dense molecular clouds and joined the disk after membership in an oc or an association . in this scenario",
    ", there is a close relationship between the compositions of ocs and the field star population .",
    "composition differences between ocs of a similar generation will be echoed among field stars .",
    "exploration of this idea requires accurate determinations of the compositions of ocs and field stars .    here",
    ", we explore inter - cluster differences in chemical composition and , in particular , search for differences in elemental abundance ratios [ el / fe ] among clusters of a common [ fe / h ] from el = na to eu .",
    "given that the majority of analyzed clusters have a near - solar metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 ) and belong to the thin disk , our investigation is centered on this particular collection of ocs .",
    "our exploration draws on our abundance analyses for 23 elements in 70 red giants belonging to 28 ocs with all analyses based on high - resolution optical spectra analyzed identically using lte model atmospheres and a common line list @xcite . in short",
    ", we prepared a linelist of 300 absorption lines covering 23 elements from na - eu sampling all the major processes of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) were measured manually using the cursor commands in _ splot _",
    "package of iraf by fitting often a gaussian profile and for a few lines a direct integration was performed for the best measure of ew .",
    "we performed a differential abundance analysis relative to the sun by running the _ abfind _ driver of * moog*@xcite adopting the 1d atlas9 stellar model atmospheres of @xcite .    in most cases ,",
    "the abundances are derived from the measured ews but synthetic profiles were computed for lines affected by hyperfine structure ( hfs ) and isotopic splitting and/or affected by blends .",
    "the features analysed by spectrum synthesis included : sc , mn , cu , zn , ba , and eu . our linelists have been tested extensively to reproduce the solar and arcturus spectra before applying them to selected spectral features in the stellar spectra of program stars . we used a standard synthetic profile fitting procedure by running the _ synth _ driver of * moog * adopting the spectroscopically determined stellar parameters .",
    "abundance differences are searched for among elements from all the major processes of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the set of abundances for a given cluster may be considered to be the cluster s",
    "chemical tag , a term introduced by @xcite . with the dissolution of clusters",
    ", the spread in chemical tags will be found among the field star population .",
    "exploration of the chemical tagging technique may proceed in either a forward or a reverse direction . by the forward direction",
    ", we refer to the identification of members of a now dissolved oc from among a sample of field stars with well - determined chemical compositions .",
    "applications of the forward technique may be found in the papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", we refer to the reverse direction as the definition of inter - cluster abundance differences on whose existence successful exploitation of the forward direction obviously rests .",
    "as far as we are aware , the only previous application of a large sample of ocs in this reverse direction is by @xcite .",
    "successful reconstruction of dissolved ocs from the field star population depends on many factors but first and foremost must be the presence , magnitude and nature of inter - cluster chemical tags . our analysis of cluster red giants provide an extensive set of compositions for ocs and , thus , a fine opportunity to address this key issue of chemical tags . here , we present convincing evidence for very particular inter - cluster abundance differences suggested preliminarily earlier @xcite .",
    "our analysis is comparable in scope and accuracy to that reported by @xcite except for one crucial difference ; our selection of elements but not that by @xcite includes several heavy elements la , ce , nd , sm and eu  which provide us with a novel insight into cluster - to - cluster differences in the contribution from the neutron - capture processes to the composition of the ocs . after defining these cluster - to - cluster differences , we searched for similar abundance differences among field dwarfs and giants .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we describe in section 2 the sample of open clusters used to address the issue of chemical tags .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussing the cluster - to - cluster abundance variations among ocs and section 4 to providing the convincing evidence for the abundance differences among field dwarfs and giants .",
    "finally , we present our concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "data on elemental abundances are taken from our analyses of red giant members of 28 ocs reported in @xcite with results for one to four stars per cluster and for usually 23 elements from na to eu .",
    "no attempt was made to combine our sample of ocs with the literature sample of ocs analysed by different authors whose analyses are subjected to systematic uncertainties of unknown magnitude from one another .",
    "the possible sources of systematic errors among the abundance analyses by different authors include differences in the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and resolution of the spectra , discrepancies in continuum tracing , adopted method of equivalent width measurements , differences in the model atmospheres , spectral - line selection , atomic data , abundance analyses technique ( i.e. , spectrum synthesis vs. ew analysis ) and type of stars considered by different authors in their analysis .",
    "we direct the reader to @xcite for a critical review of systematic errors .",
    "a simple merger of published abundances may mask subtle abundance trends .",
    "moreover , a key enhancement of our analysis relative to analyses in the literature is that our ocs are essentially the only ones which sample well the elements from la to eu .",
    "this analysis draws on the selection of clusters belonging to the thin disk with particular attention focused on clusters around [ fe / h ] of zero .",
    "specifically , we consider in detail three groups : i ) [ fe / h ] = 0.0@xmath2 , ii ) [ fe / h ] @xmath3 and iii ) [ fe / h ] @xmath4 .",
    "group i consists of 4 clusters .",
    "group ii is the largest group with 16 clusters and group iii is another sparse group with 5 clusters . with a single exception , these clusters have ages between about 100 myr to 1 gyr . only three clusters , namely ngc 2345 ( [ fe / h]@xmath50.26@xmath60.03 ) , ngc 2266 ( [ fe / h]@xmath50.45@xmath60.04 ) , ngc 2632 ( [ fe / h]@xmath70.08@xmath60.03 ) , are falling outside the [ fe / h ] range defined by the ocs in groups i , ii , and iii and were excluded from the present analysis .",
    "all but ngc 2266 in our total oc sample belong to the thin disk population .",
    "red giants analyzed by us span small ranges in atmospheric parameters so that systematic errors across our sample are likely to be small .",
    "a majority of the red giants have an effective temperature of about 4900 k and a surface gravity of about 2.6 dex with a cool limit at 4200 k and hot limit at 5400 k with a correlated range in surface gravity from 0.9 to 2.8 dex .",
    "comparisons with the literature for main sequence and subgiant stars in clusters and the field will probably encounter offsets in abundances [ el / h ] and abundance ratios [ el / fe ] with several possible causes .",
    "two recent studies of dwarfs and giants in the same cluster have shown that abundance differences are small .",
    "@xcite analyzed five clusters and showed that abundance differences for [ fe / h ] and [ el / fe ] were less than 0.05 dex or almost every element considered except for na which was enhanced in giants , an enhancement largely , if not wholly , arising from the first dredge - up affecting the giants .",
    "@xcite provide a similar comparison for fe in cool dwarfs and giants of the hyades cluster .",
    "abundance analyses of field dwarfs and giants conducted by different investigators may have larger systematic differences .    although few stars were analyzed per cluster , when two or more stars were observed and analyzed consistent results were obtained .",
    "in particular , the paper s principal result  that there are real inter - cluster differences for heavy elements with principal contributions from the @xmath0-process  is supported by each of the few observed stars in key clusters , i.e. , our result is not an artifact arising from the overlooked inclusion of a barium giant ( a star whose @xmath0-process overabundances were contributed through mass - transfer from a companion ) . additionally and significantly , the observed cluster members are at luminosities where internal @xmath0-process enrichment is not anticipated",
    ".    we probe through the figure [ inter_cluster ] the presence of internal chemical homogeneity among members of given cluster and the significant cluster - to - cluster abundance spread in [ el / fe ] for the heavy @xmath0-process elements among clusters of a common [ fe / h ] .",
    "figure [ inter_cluster ] shows the [ la / fe ] values measured for individual cluster members for the ocs in group i. examination of the figure [ inter_cluster ] suggests that the typical star - to - star abundance dispersion in [ la / fe ] as quantified by fitting a gaussian function to the residual abundance of [ la / fe ] of a star is about 0.03@xmath60.01 dex ( see the figure caption ) .",
    "the ocs in figure [ inter_cluster ] demonstrate that the internal chemical homogeneity is very small relative to the cluster - to - cluster inhomogeneity which for [ la / fe ] is 0.4 dex .",
    "the mean [ la / fe ] values for the clusters in figure [ inter_cluster ] range over 0.4 dex ( i.e. , @xmath80.17 dex for ngc 1647 to @xmath90.26 dex for ngc 2527 ) ; this range is almost ten times larger than the internal abundance dispersion found for [ la / fe ] from a given cluster .",
    "inspection of the [ x / fe ] for the other heavy elements confirms that the cluster - to - cluster abundance spread seen in [ la / fe ] is repeated for ce , nd and sm for which we found the typical star - to - star abundance dispersion of 0.027@xmath60.008 dex , 0.032@xmath60.014 dex and 0.035@xmath60.007 dex , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the heavy @xmath0-process elemental abundances , the cluster - to - cluster scatter is small for the light @xmath0-process elements  y ( figure [ labatoeu_oc ] ) and zr .",
    "therefore , the striking spread in the abundances of heavy @xmath0-process elements from one cluster to another whose members exhibit high level of chemical homogeneity within a given cluster confirms that there is real inter - cluster differences in [ el / fe ] for la to sm .",
    "consideration of the red giants compositions led @xcite to suggest that there was a spread in the abundances of heavy elements la , ce and nd which exceeded plausible estimates of the measurement errors and that presence of a spread did not extend to the lighter element y. with our now larger sample of ocs , these preliminary results are confirmed and extended .",
    "figure [ labatoeu_oc ] constructed from our sample of ocs highlight the key aspects of the intra - cluster abundance differences among the heavier elements .",
    "figure [ labatoeu_oc ] for ocs from [ fe / h ] groups i , ii and iii shows that the average [ el / fe ] for each cluster is well correlated for la , ce , nd and sm but y and eu show a very much weaker correlation with [ la / fe ] . for the strong baii 5853   and 6496   lines , the larger abundance uncertainty arising principally from the sensitivity to the microturbulence likely masks the abundance spread .    the spread in [ el",
    "/ fe ] for la to sm is a real effect .",
    "the small offsets ",
    "i.e. , [ ce / fe ] @xmath10 at [ la / fe ] @xmath11  may not be real because of various systematic effects including the adopted @xmath12-values and non - lte effects .",
    "differences in the behavior of la , ce , nd and sm ( also ba ) are approximately correlated with the @xmath0-process contributions made to the solar system abundances for these elements .",
    "synthesis of these elements is provided by both the neutron capture @xmath0- and @xmath13-processes . according to @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0-process contribution to solar system abundances is 85% for ba , 75% for la , 81% for ce , 47% for nd , 34% for sm and only 3% for eu .",
    "this same reference assigns 72% of y and 81% of zr to the @xmath0-process but , as figure [ labatoeu_oc ] indicates , the spread seen in la and ce , for example , is not repeated for y.    the pattern of decreasing heavy element enrichment in the sequence la to eu resembles but does not exactly match that of the solar system @xmath0-process .",
    "linear least - squares fits to the data in figure [ labatoeu_oc ] give slopes for [ el / fe ] versus [ la / fe ] of 0.17@xmath14 ( r@xmath150.52 ) for y , 0.69@xmath16 ( r@xmath150.79 ) for ce , 0.50@xmath17 ( r@xmath150.69 ) for nd , 0.54@xmath17 ( r@xmath150.71 ) for sm and @xmath18 ( r@xmath150.49 ) for eu , where r is the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient .",
    "in particular , the eu trend is not compatible with the 3@xmath19 expected from the solar system s @xmath0-process .",
    "a simple interpretation of figure [ labatoeu_oc ] is that the main @xmath0-process contributions influencing the spread in ba - sm abundances contribute little to the spread in y whose abundance is most likely then set primarily by the weak @xmath0-process occurring during he and c shell hydrostatic burning in massive stars .",
    "the source of the main @xmath0-process is , of course , thermally - pulsing agb stars .",
    "variations from cluster - to - cluster exhibited in figure [ labatoeu_oc ] are at the precision provided by our abundance analyses of red giants uncorrelated with abundances of fe - group and lighter elements .",
    "figure [ almg_heavy ] shows the la@xmath8sm abundances plotted with the al and mg abundances .",
    "the large spread in [ el / fe ] for la@xmath8sm is in sharp contrast with the much smaller spread in [ al / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] .",
    "there may be a tendency for [ al / fe ] and , perhaps , also [ mg / fe ] to decline slightly with increasing [ el / fe ] for la@xmath8sm .    as a supplement to visual inspection for picking out abundance differences among stars of similar metallicities ,",
    "we compare the distributions of [ el / h ] and [ el / fe ] with those expected from the measurement uncertainties and the assumption that all stars have of the same [ fe / h ] have identical [ el / fe ] .",
    "we quantify the cluster - to - cluster scatter in the elemental abundance ratios , [ el / h ] and [ el / fe ] for an element el by fitting a gaussian function to histograms of number of stars ( y - axis ) versus the average abundance ratios ( x - axis ) [ el / h ] and [ el / fe ] of an element el measured for red giants in all ocs in groups i and ii covering the narrow [ fe / h ] interval of 0.0@xmath60.05 dex to @xmath80.10@xmath60.05 dex .",
    "[ sigmas_oc ]    .estimates of @xmath20s from gaussian fits to the histogram of number of stars versus the average abundance of an element el measured for red giants in all the ocs in groups i and ii along with the measurement error expected for the same element el due to uncertainties in the stellar atmospheric parameters and the equivalent width measurements .",

    "( 2014 ) with heavy element abundances provided by battistini & bensby ( 2016 ) .",
    "abundances for [ fe / h ] groups i , ii and iii are presented in figure [ labatoeu_bensby ] with the dashed lines taken from figure [ labatoeu_oc ] but with offsets adjusted to get the best fit . although the dashed lines provide a fair account of the abundances for the dwarfs , the account is not as convincing as that offered by the giants and figure [ labatoeu_mishenina ] .",
    "comparison of the figures for field giants and dwarfs suggests that the scatter about the dashed line in each panel is larger for dwarfs than for giants with a contribution for dwarfs resulting from systematic differences between [ fe / h ] groups i , ii and iii .",
    "systematic shifts between groups are especially noticeable for nd , sm and eu , the three elements with smaller contributions from a main @xmath0-process than la and ce .",
    "y does not exhibit this scatter .",
    "an offset between groups is especially noticeable for eu .",
    "the ages of the thin disk dwarfs ( 2 to 10 gyr ) are considerably greater than for our ocs ( 0.1 to 1 gyr ) .",
    "this age difference and figure [ labatoeu_mishenina ] and [ labatoeu_bensby ] may suggest that the nature of a chemical tag for open clusters evolves over the milky way s lifetime .",
    "possibly , this particular piece of evidence refers to contributions from the @xmath13-process sources ( type ii supernovae or merging neutron stars ? ) .    for an alternative consideration of the abundances across groups",
    "i ii and iii for both luck s ( 2015 ) sample of giants and bensby et al.s ( 2014 ) and battistini & besby et al.s ( 2016 ) sample of thin disk dwarfs , we present in table [ sigmas_battistini ] @xmath21 from the distributions of [ el / h ] and [ el / fe ] .",
    "this table shows that the majority of elements lighter than ni have very similar and small @xmath21s , e.g. , @xmath22 for [ el / h ] and @xmath23 for [ el / fe ] for the dwarfs and giants",
    ". y and eu show a @xmath21 of a similar value for dwarfs and only a slightly larger value for the giants . our ocs sample ( table [ sigmas_oc ] ) show @xmath21 for y and eu",
    "similar to these values .",
    "the reported @xmath21s are similar to the expected values and , thus , the intrinsic contributions to [ el / h ] and [ el / fe ] are small . for heavier elements , the @xmath21s from ba to sm",
    "are larger than expected and , thus , there is a real star - to - star scatter . in the case of ba to eu , @xmath21s for ce and sm for giants may be ignored ( see figure [ labatoeu_luck ] ) but values for ba , la , nd and eu are close to the values ( table [ sigmas_oc ] ) for ocs . for the field dwarfs , the @xmath21s for y to eu",
    "are generally compatible with values for the ocs .",
    "table [ sigmas_battistini ] is , of course , a reflection of figures [ labatoeu_luck ] and [ labatoeu_mishenina ] and their relation to figure [ labatoeu_oc ] .",
    "presence of abundance differences based on heavy element [ el / fe ] for ba to sm has been established for ocs in the thin disk with near solar metallicity ( groups i , ii and iii ) and identified as present among similar metallicity field giants and dwarfs .",
    "thus , there is a possibility that such differences may serve as a chemical tag .",
    "it is of interest to know if the tag may be found among more metal - poor thin disk stars and stars in the thick disk .",
    "to investigate these points , we separated the thin and thick disk field dwarfs analysed by @xcite and @xcite into several metallicity bins .    for the thin disk ,",
    "the available sample extends to about a [ fe / h ] of @xmath24 , the @xmath21s for ni and lighter elements remain small , i.e. , higher abundance precision is needed to extract the intrinsic scatter in [ el / fe ] .",
    "al is a possible exception with the @xmath21 for [ al / fe ] increasing with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "for heavy elements , the @xmath21 for la to eu , as [ fe / h ] declines , depart from the clean pattern in table [ sigmas_battistini ] ( also , that in table [ sigmas_oc ] ) and at [ fe / h ] @xmath25 the @xmath21s for [ el / h ] for la , ce , nd , sm and eu are 0.14 , 0.24 , 0.12 , 0.18 and 0.16 , respectively , and about 40 stars contributing .    for the thick disk which is well sampled to about a [ fe / h ] of @xmath26 ,",
    "the abundance pattern of the chemical tag from the ocs is not perfectly repeated .",
    "in particular sm has a larger spread than nd and eu has a large spread .",
    "this pattern resembles that found for the low [ fe / h ] end of the thin disk .",
    "inspired by a search for chemical tags among open clusters , our abundance analysis using high - resolution optical spectra of a representative sample of ocs led to the first definition of a cluster - to - cluster difference in the abundances of heavy elements .",
    "the pattern of these differences is summarized well by figure [ labatoeu_oc ] for clusters with metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath1 : inter - cluster differences are small for y and eu and larger for la , ce , nd and sm with amplitudes that scale quite well with the neutron capture main @xmath0-process s contribution to solar system material .",
    "a small cluster - to - cluster difference for y suggests the main @xmath0-process contributions are small for this lighter element whose abundance may be set by the weak @xmath0-process from massive stars which also influence the abundances of @xmath27- elements mg and si .",
    "evidence of small inter - cluster differences for eu in excess of that expected from the ` solar system ' main @xmath0-process suggest either a modification of that @xmath0-process or contributions from an @xmath13-process which vary from cluster - to - cluster .",
    "abundance differences ( figure [ almg_heavy ] ) for mg , al , si , cu and zn between the most and least heavy - element enriched clusters also suggest that the @xmath0-process contributors are not the sole contributor of chemical tags . for a given [ fe / h ] , it would appear  and reasonably so  that type ii and type ia supernovae have contributed in different proportions and possibly with a significant dispersion in relative abundances in their contributions .",
    "the main @xmath0-process operates in thermally - pulsing agb stars . in their he - shell",
    ", the relative yields of ba to eu are set primarily by the neutron - capture cross - sections and , thus the fair match of cluster abundances to solar system @xmath0-process fractions is not surprising .",
    "y and zr are separated from ba to eu by the neutron magic number n=50 and @xmath0-process abundances of y and zr relative to ba to eu are largely determined by the neutron flux in the he shell .",
    "similar trends among the heavy elements are seen among field giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 , as anticipated .",
    "consideration of heavy element abundances among thin disk field dwarfs also with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 shows a spread in heavy element abundances .",
    "the age spread in the samples differ substantially : our oc range from 0.1 to 1.0 gyr but the field dwarfs average about 6 gyr .",
    "there is an indication that the heavy element chemical tag changes with time . our present sample of ocs",
    "should be expanded to include ocs with ages greater than 1 gyr .",
    "a few such ocs from both the thin and thick disks have been analysed for iron and lighter elements , as our literature survey @xcite showed , but data on heavy elements is essentially lacking .",
    "comprehensive analyses of older ocs would provide a direct comparison with field stars of the thin and thick disks .",
    "these analyses deserve to be matched with an exhaustive study of the thin and thick disks .",
    "of especial note is the fact discussed in section [ abu_diff : clusters ] , presently available analyses of six associations all with [ fe / h]@xmath28 suggest that they lack the spread in heavy element abundances seen across the sample of open clusters .",
    "if this is not a reflection of an unrepresentative sample of associations or subtle systematic errors , it poses an interesting question awaiting an answer .",
    "a simple inference from the presence of the chemical tag based on heavy elements is that thermally - pulsing mass - losing agb stars have to differing degrees polluted molecular clouds , the birthplaces of open clusters , whose composition is otherwise established primarily by massive stars and their supernovae , type ia supernovae and possibly merging neutron stars .",
    "variations in contributions from these other sources of nucleosynthesis primarily affect relative abundances of lighter elements ( say , mg to zn ) .",
    "expansion of the chemical tag to some or all of these elements will likely require an additional improvement in accuracy with close attention to sources of systematic errors ; table [ sigmas_oc ] shows that the observed dispersions for [ el / h ] and [ el / fe ] for many of the mg to zn elements are comparable to the dispersions from the measurement uncertainties .",
    "this uncovered trend among the abundances of heavy elements would seem to provide a basis for chemically tagging open clusters .",
    "the total spread in la and ce abundances is about 0.5 dex among the ocs examined todate .",
    "mean abundances for a cluster are determined to about 0.07@xmath80.08 dex including uncertainties due to the stellar atmospheric parameters and equivalent width measurements .",
    "it would appear that the abundance spread among ocs is such that several clusters may have identical patterns of heavy element to within the measurement uncertainties . while this overlap may impair the specificity of a heavy element tag , a combination of this tag with one or more elements such as mg , al and si and/or cu and zn ( see figure [ almg_heavy ] ) may yield a more incisive tag .",
    "such a more - detailed exploration of chemical tagging in the forward direction is left for a future paper .",
    "pursuit of chemical tagging in the reverse direction is left for hardier souls .",
