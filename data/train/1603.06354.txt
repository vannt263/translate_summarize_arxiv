    "the investigation of the correlation functions is a useful tool to measure properties of the strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) such as the size or the asymmetries of the medium .",

    "al . developed it to measure the size of the source in heavy ion reactions @xcite .",
    "if the system is not spherically symmetric there could be azimuthal dependence of the hbt radii . in the framework of the buda - lund model",
    "the @xmath0 order oscillation of these radii can be investigated ( see @xcite ) but the experiments show that ( e.g. in @xcite ) there are triangular ( @xmath1 order ) oscillations too . to observed the azimuthal dependence of the radii it has to be investigated in the corresponding reaction plane . in the extended buda - lund model",

    "there are two kinds of asymmetries that can be important to understand the phenomenology of the dynamics , the asymmetry of the space - time distribution and the velocity field distribution .",
    "the asymmetry of the space - time distribution is ensured by a scale parameter @xmath8 .",

    "we can generalize the model through this parameter .",
    "+ let us write up @xmath8 in a cylindrical coordinate system instead of cartesian with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and prescribe the azimuthal angle dependence .",
    "a general case can be written up like : @xmath11 the ellipsoidal case corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "there is a known solution of the hydrodynamics with similar generalization of the @xmath8 in ref .",
