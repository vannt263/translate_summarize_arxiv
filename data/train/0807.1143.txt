    "the wds in polars are highly magnetized with magnetic field strengths that range between 10 - 240 mg . eventually , the accreting material couples to the field lines of the wd and is transported to the magnetic pole(s ) of the star where a dense , standing - shock is formed , with nominal temperatures of 2 - 20 kev , which cools by emitting bremsstrahlung and cyclotron radiation .    am her is the prototype polar ( see tapia , 1977a ) .",
    "it has an orbital period of 3.094 hrs and is nearby ( 78 pc ; thorensten et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "despite being extensively studied many characteristics of the system remain uncertain .",
    "one point of discrepancy is the exact mass of the primary wd with estimates ranging from 0.39 m@xmath5 ( young et al . , 1981 ) to 1.22 m@xmath5 ( cropper et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "additionally , the geometry of the system remains unclear with orbital inclination estimates ranging from @xmath1 = 35@xmath2 ( brainerd & lamb , 1985 ) to @xmath1 = 60@xmath2 - 80@xmath2 ( watson et al . , 2003 ) , although the self - eclipse observed in the x - ray and uv requires that @xmath1 + @xmath3 @xmath6 90@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the magnetic co - latitude .",

    "finally , bailey , ferrario , & wickramasinghe ( 1991 ; henceforth bfw91 ) used a constant lambda ( `` cl '' ) code to model the nir low - state ( v @xmath14 15.0 ) cyclotron spectrum , which were binned into bright - phase ( @xmath15 = 0.46 - 0.88 ) and dim - phase ( @xmath15 = 0.46 - 0.88 ) spectra .",

    "because of the narrow slit size on irtf / spex ( 0.3  ) infrared photometry is required to calibrate the fluxes of the spectra",
    ". the @xmath22 photometry for each object was obtained with sqiid on the kpno 2.1-m telescope ( ellis et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "am her was observed on 2002 september 26 , and st lmi on 2003 april 9 . in addition , we obtained simultaneous @xmath31 photometry on 2005 may 20 for am her .",
    "the @xmath22 photometry was obtained with nic - fps on the apache point 3.5-m , while the optical data set was obtained with the nmsu 1-m ( see harrison et al . , 2003 ) . to aid the reader ,",
    "we have collated all the observational specifics in table 1 .",
    "to produce our cyclotron models , we use a constant - lambda ( `` cl '' ) cyclotron code first developed by schwope ( 1990 ) . in campbell",
    "et al . ( 2008a ; hereafter paper i ) , we presented a theoretical synopsis of cl modeling which will not be repeated here .",
    "the model spectra depend on four global parameters : b ( the magnetic field strength ) , kt ( the plasma temperature ) , @xmath32 ( the viewing angle to the magnetic `` pole '' ) , and @xmath0 ( the `` size parameter '' ) , which is closely tied to the column density along the line of sight through the accretion region . in paper i , we found that we could adequately model the data for ef eri as cyclotron + wd . in campbell et al .",
    "( 2008b ; hereafter paper ii ) , we found that in many polars there are other sources of non - stellar continuum radiation ( e.g. , bremsstrahlung emission ) which contaminate the spectra and need to be taken into account .",
    "for each object in paper ii , the accretion column was self - eclipsed . in this case ,",
    "cyclotron emission is only seen for the part of the orbital cycle when the accretion column is in view ( the `` bright - phase '' ) although it is contaminated by other sources . to subtract these away ,",
    "we assume that the `` dim - phase '' spectra represent all the additional components of radiation which obfuscate the cyclotron emission .",
    "the dim - phase spectrum is then subtracted from the spectra at other phases where accretion column is in view , thus yielding uncontaminated cyclotron spectra over the orbit .",
    "we refer to the dim - phase subtraction method as `` stream - emission subtraction '' ( se - subtraction ) for consistency with schwope et al .",
    "an additional contaminant for the objects in the current work is the irradiated secondary star whose spectral type slowly changes with phase and can not be completely subtracted .",
    "thus , when the se - subtraction technique was applied features due to the secondary star remained .      in figure 1 , we show the @xmath22 lightcurves taken with the sqiid on the kpno 2.1-m on 2002 september 26 , at a time when the system was at @xmath12 = 15.5 .",
    "this is a typical low - state magnitude identical to that of our spex spectroscopy , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . overlaid in each band , are binary star models computed using wd2005 with a m5 secondary at an orbital inclination of @xmath1 = 50@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath29-band morphology is well explained by classic ellipsoidal variations except the lightcurve minimum at @xmath15 = 0.00 is somewhat deeper than predicted and residual structure appears at the @xmath18j = 0.05 mag level .",
    "the derived inclination should be considered a lower limit because other dilution sources may be present .",
    "both the @xmath33 + @xmath10 lightcurves show a large cyclotron component folded - in with the ellipsoidal variations . in fig .",
    "3 , we include additional @xmath31 photometry obtained 2.5 years later on 2005 may 20 , at a time when the system was again at similar brightness .",
    "we find that the same ellipsoidal models provide excellent fits to the @xmath22 data at this epoch . because of the narrow slit size on spex ( 0.3  ) , at each orbital phase we flux calibrate our spectra to the `` cyclotron - free '' @xmath29-band lightcurve .",
    "the irtf phase - resolved spectra from 2005 september 1 are dominated by emission from the secondary star . to remove this component",
    ", we subtracted the spectrum at @xmath15 = 0.42 from every other phase .",
    "the subtraction spectrum is near to both the ellipsoidal minimum ( @xmath15 = 0.50 ) and because of the ongoing self - eclipse , is free of cyclotron emission . to approximate the effect of the ellipsoidal variability , we scaled the subtraction spectrum at each phase to match the magnitude expected from our ellipsoidal models .",
    "the underlying continuum sed and intrinsic water vapor features at 1.35 and 1.85 @xmath34 m in the residual spectra were orbitally variable producing a small blue excess and apparent water vapor emission at ellipsoidal maxima ( @xmath15 = 0.25 , 0.75 ) , and a red excess with apparent water vapor absorption at ellipsoidal minima ( @xmath15 = 0.00 , 0.50 ) , resulting from a changing spectral type as the distorted secondary star changed orientation . from m4 to m6 water vapor absorption becomes ever more pronounced .",
    "thus , even small differences of the secondary temperature are apparent in our data and residuals from the water vapor features remain in our final spectra ( shown in black in fig .",
    "the final cyclotron models are overlaid in green .",
    "no cyclotron emission was observed over the interval 0.27 @xmath35 0.74 due to the self - eclipse of the emission region .",
    "thus , these phases are not shown in fig . 4 to aid in the presentation of data .",
    "between 0.92 @xmath35 0.09 , the spectra appear to show a single strong cyclotron harmonic ( @xmath36 = 4 ) near 2.0 @xmath34 m .",
    "the @xmath36 = 4 , 5 , and 6 harmonics are obvious between 0.20 @xmath37 0.26 and again from 0.75 @xmath37 0.86 .    for our best fit cyclotron models at each phase , see table 2 .",
    "the average parameter values are : b = 13.6@xmath38 mg , kt = 4.0@xmath39 kev , and log@xmath0 = 5.0@xmath40 , with an average @xmath41 = 2.42 .",
    "the statistical limits were derived by finding where the value of @xmath41 changed by 50 % over its fiducial value .",
    "we find that @xmath1 + @xmath3 = 135@xmath2 , with @xmath1 = 50@xmath2 , @xmath3 = 85@xmath2 , @xmath42 = 0.01 , where @xmath42 is defined as the bluest position of the cyclotron harmonics .      in fig . 5",
    ", we present @xmath22 lightcurves of st lmi taken with the kpno 2.1-m during the normal high accretion state of the system . in each band",
    "the morphology is similar : the dim - phase lasts from 0.00 @xmath35 0.55 with mean magnitudes of 14.4 , 13.9 , and 13.9 in the @xmath29 , @xmath33 , and @xmath10-bands , respectively . during the subsequent bright - phase ,",
    "the object brightens significantly ( @xmath43 = 1.5 mag ) . like",
    "am her , a wd2005 ellipsoidal model was fit to the nir lightcurves , finding @xmath1 = 55@xmath2 .",
    "the models well approximate the dim - phase of st lmi in the @xmath29 and @xmath33-bands , while the fit in the @xmath10-band is more uncertain due to the larger scatter in the photometry .",
    "st lmi was observed spectroscopically over its entire orbit once on 2005 february 7 and once on 2006 february 2 . on both occasions , photometry is available within one month of our phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "6 shows the high / low states of st lmi over the entire history of roboscope and also over a shorter , @xmath14 1.5 year baseline surrounding our 2005 and 2006 irtf observations .",
    "for the first dataset , the nearest roboscope data ( february 28 ) shows 17.1 @xmath11 17.8 , similar in brightness to its 1992 - 1997 protracted `` low - state '' .",
    "however , as will be discussed below , our bright - phase spectroscopy show a conspicuous lack of cyclotron emission during this epoch .",
    "for this reason , we believe the object was in fact in an `` extreme low - state '' at the time of observation , similar to that observed on 2006 feb 12 by kafka et al .",
    "( 2007 ) which found 18.0 @xmath11 18.4 .",
    "curiously , our 2006 data was obtained only 10 days prior to that epoch , but shows clear evidence of cyclotron emission and thus must have been in a normal low - state .",
    "we note , however , photometric extreme low - states like that observed by kafka et al .",
    "are short lived , as normal low states were observed within a month both before and after it .",
    "the spectra of st lmi are also strongly contaminated by its secondary star at every phase . during the extreme low - state we found no evidence for cyclotron emission , with the secondary contributing all of the nir flux at each orbital phase . in fig .",
    "7 , we show the observed spex spectrum at @xmath15 = 0.02 of the 2005 dataset with the best - fitting secondary template overlaid ( m6 ) .    for the 2006 low - state , we present se - subtracted data in fig .",
    "the se spectrum was produced by averaging the dim - phase spectra together . since the relative uncertainty in the howell et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ephemeris is rather large ( @xmath44 ) , we phased our data by defining ellipsoidal minimum in our 2003 kpno lightcurve as @xmath15 = 0.50 , and then using the howell et al .",
    "( 2000 ) period . we found that averaging three dim - phase spectra together produced the best se - subtraction spectra , with faint cyclotron features visible during the bright orbital phase at @xmath14 2.25 , 1.85 , 1.53 and perhaps 1.30 @xmath34 m , corresponding to the @xmath36 = 4 - 7 harmonics in a field with b = 12 mg .",
    "like am her , the tidally distorted nature of the secondary star imparts spectral type and overall flux changes that are orbitally modulated allowing residual emission / absorption from the secondary star to remain even after se subtraction has been performed .",
    "indeed , the upturn in the @xmath29-band sed as well as the strong water vapor absorption at @xmath45 0.73 are indicative of subtraction of too cool a secondary star at those phases . in fig .",
    "8b , we display the phase - resolved spectra from the 2005 extreme low - state . like the 2006 low - state the se spectrum was found by averaging three dim - phase spectra together .",
    "while weak cyclotron emission was observed during the 2006 low - state none was seen during the 2005 extreme low - state .",
    "previous work has determined that st lmi is a one pole accretor with 55@xmath2 @xmath23 64@xmath2 and 140@xmath2 @xmath24 150@xmath2 ( schmidt et al . , 1983 ;",
    "potter , 2000 ) .",
    "the primary accretion region also appears to have some structure .",
    "fbw93 computed cyclotron models for st lmi in a high state , finding that two separate emission regions were needed to adequately model the observed spectra from the primary pole : the first is a high temperature / high density region located between magnetic longitudes ( @xmath46 ) 130 and 170 that has kt = 12.0 kev , and log@xmath0 = 7.6 .",
    "the second is located between 170 @xmath47 250 with kt = 5 kev and log@xmath0 = 4.4 .",
    "both regions had magnetic field strengths of @xmath13 12.0 mg , a result which is consistent with the values previously published .",
    "the relevancy of these models to our spex data is unclear since they were determined when the object was in a high state ( @xmath29 = 13.8 ) more similar to that observed in our sqiid photometry than our low - state spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , peacock et al .",
    "( 1992 ) reported seeing a second pole in st lmi during a high - state ( @xmath48 @xmath14 16.7 ) .",
    "their @xmath33-band photometry showed a sudden increase of @xmath18@xmath33 = 0.3 mag at @xmath15 = 0.35 was observed , with the @xmath29-band showing a smaller increase .",
    "simultaneous polarization curves were published along with their photometry that found v / i = 15 - 20% over the duration of the alleged secondary pole .",
    "the errors , however , were extremely large and the data are in fact , consistent with zero polarization . because both the phasing and amplitude of the lightcurve variations are consistent with the wd2005 models found in this study ( fig .",
    "5 ) , we believe the excess @xmath33-band feature may be due to ellipsoidal variability from the secondary star .",
    "we used the published values @xmath1 and @xmath3 to constrain the orbital variation of @xmath32 and thus , effectively limit the possible parameter space to three dimensions , b , kt and log@xmath0 . because of the very low rate of accretion , the models presented here have low temperatures .",

    "we have presented the first phase - resolved ir spectroscopy published for these two sources allowing for enhanced leverage over the parameters modeled .",
    "the data presented in this paper proved the most challenging to model in this series . in paper i , we covered the basics of cyclotron modeling and applied our technique to nir spectra of ef eri finding that it could be modeled using only cyclotron and wd emission . in paper ii , we found that other sources of contamination could be eliminated by subtracting the dim phase spectrum from each phase for which cyclotron emission was observed . in the present work , however , the spectra of both am her and st lmi are dominated by emission from the secondary star in the nir . because of the orbitally modulated nature of both the spectral type and brightness of the secondary , additional issues arose .",
    "naive subtraction of only a single dim - phase spectrum from every other phase is manifested in two ways .",
    "first , variable water vapor absorption / emission is seen at at 1.35 , 1.85 @xmath34 m .",
    "second , the underlying sed cycles twice between a red and blue excess over the orbit .",
    "both artifacts result from the changing spectral type of the secondary star . because we subtract the same phase from each spectrum , the secondary imprint in the se - spectrum alternates between being too cool and too hot when compared to the features seen at other phases .",
    "to assuage the situation , we median combined three dim - phase spectra separated by @xmath30 = 0.25 , to produce the final se spectrum , thus smearing out the effects of a changing secondary star .    in am her , we found that for the bright - phase of the 2006 low - state ( v @xmath13 15.5 ) spex data : b = 13.7 @xmath9 1.0 mg , kt = 4.2@xmath9 1.0 kev , and log@xmath0 = 5.0@xmath9 0.5 .",
    "the result is in dramatic contrast with that found in bfw91 at a time when the system was also in a low , though perhaps slightly higher state ( v @xmath13 15.0 ) : b = 14.5 @xmath9 0.3 mg , kt = 8.5 @xmath9 0.5 kev , and log@xmath0 = 3.3 @xmath9 0.3 .",
    "while the magnetic field strengths for the two epochs agree to within their errors , the same can not be said for both the temperatures and values of log@xmath0 .",
    "our spex data show a system with a cooler plasma than that inferred by bfw91 .",
    "to quantify this difference , we evoke the results of fischer & beuermann ( 2001 ) , which found kt@xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 , which we rewrite as : @xmath54 = ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 .",
    "plugging in the average bright - phase parameters from the two epochs yields that the @xmath57 for the modeled spex data must be a factor of 2.34 lower than that active during the bfw91 observations .",
    "the higher temperatures found in bfw91 may be an artifact of medianing together moving cyclotron harmonics over @xmath14 40 % of the orbit , which artifically broadens each feature .",
    "the final spectra and models allow us to understand the changing morphology of am her s nir light - curves . in fig .",
    "3b , the @xmath29-band is well explained by ellipsoidal variations alone , while in the @xmath33 + @xmath10-bands the cyclotron emission component is substantial , with a maximum contribution of 0.25 mag in both bands and disappearing at @xmath15 = 0.00 .",
    "the @xmath10-band cyclotron component is relatively constant over the phases 0.75 @xmath35 0.25 .",
    "such behavior is explained by the cyclotron models shown in fig .",
    "4 . near @xmath15 = 0.00 the @xmath36 = 4 harmonic dominates due to the low viewing angle ( @xmath58 ) at that time .",
    "consequently , no emission is seen in the @xmath33-band .",
    "later , ( 0.25 @xmath35 0.75 ) the viewing angle is larger causing the higher harmonics ( @xmath36 = 5 and 6 ) to be excited and thus a peak in the @xmath33-band emission is observed . because the @xmath36 = 4 harmonic is mostly optically thick",
    ", however , the cyclotron emission in the @xmath10-band remains relatively constant over the entire bright - phase .",
    "the simultaneous optical photometry are also interesting . in the @xmath59 and @xmath60 bands ,",

    "( 1998 ) modeled similar uv lightcurves as a hot - spot . in that work ,",
    "three uv bands covering wavelength regions of 1150 - 1167@xmath61 , 1254 - 1286@xmath61 , and 1412 - 1427@xmath61 were found to be consistent with a 47000 k hotspot centered on @xmath46 = 0@xmath2 and covering 9 % of the wd surface .",
    "we find the similarity of our @xmath48-band lightcurve to gansicke et al.s uv lightcurves to be striking .",
    "both lightcurves show identical phasing and have amplitudes that are consistent .",
    "we note , however , the large value of @xmath48 - @xmath12 @xmath13 0.15 during the bright phase . for any reasonable hotspot",
    ", @xmath48 - @xmath12 should be closer to 0.00 . because ( a ) the uv lightcurves predict a very similar geometry ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and phase ) to our cyclotron emission region and ( b ) the limited wavelength coverage of the uv lightcurves , we find that this excess emission could be caused by a partially saturated high - field cyclotron harmonic ( @xmath36 = 3 or 4 ) that falls off toward the blue end of the @xmath12-band and extends through the bluest uv band .",
    "such a broad harmonic ( @xmath26 = 0.4 @xmath34 m ) is expected in cyclotron emission ( see am her s @xmath36=4 harmonic in fig .",
    "4 , which is more or less flat from 1.9 @xmath34 m to 2.4 @xmath34 m . )",
    "if the emission were from the @xmath36 = 4 harmonic it would imply a @xmath14 90 mg field .",
    "we also speculated on the presence of a similar secondary high - field pole for ef eri in paper i.    during the bright phase of the 2006 low - state , st lmi displayed cyclotron emission with the following properties : b = 12.1 @xmath9 0.5 m , kt = 3.3 @xmath9 1.8 kev and log@xmath0 = 5.7 @xmath9 0.6 similar to the `` cool spot '' found in fbw93 . in addition , our accretion region appears to be in a similar location on the wd surface : at magnetic longitude @xmath46 = 120@xmath2 , lagging behind the onset of the secondary accretion region found in fbw93 by @xmath62 @xmath13 0.13 , likely due to the accumulation in phase - error between 1991 and 2005 .",
    "unfortunately , no errors are given for any of the cyclotron parameters in fbw93 and thus the significance of the difference in results is hard to assess . however ,",
    "both the fbw93 magnetic field strength , and the plasma temperature agree to within our errors .",
    "more interesting is the non - detection of their primary accretion region which should trail the observed `` secondary '' emission region by about 0.10 in phase , implying an onset at @xmath15 @xmath13 0.60 which is not seen .      in both cases ,",
    "the geometry of the emission region was consistent with a simple single spot model having a constant orbital inclination and magnetic colatitude . in fig .",
    "9 , we plot ( black ) the cyclotron derived values of the viewing angle against the orbital phase for both am her(top ) and st lmi(bottom ) . in red are the simple geometrical models , with the blue shading indicating phases for which the cyclotron regions are self eclipsed .",
    "the models fit the am her data well for nearly all phases , only deviating near self - eclipse ingress and egress , where the viewing angle is changing rapidly compared to the cadence of our spectroscopy . for st lmi ,",
    "the bright phase is relatively short , lasting @xmath13 40 % of the orbit .",
    "consequently , few data were available to constrain its geometry .",
    "we thus used published values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 for an additional constraint , finding that we could match the data with models quite similar to those found in the literature .    for am her",
    ", the cyclotron models imply an orbital inclination of @xmath1 = 50@xmath2 , identical to that found in the ellipsoidal modeling effort , although higher angles are possible if additional sources of dilution remain in the ir light curves .",
    "agreement was also found for the ellipsoidal and cyclotron inclinations for st lmi finding values of @xmath1 = 55@xmath2 and 40@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the later value represents the lowest inclination ellipsoidal model , and values of @xmath1 = 55@xmath2 are more consistent with the lightcurve ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . some caution ,",
    "however , should be given to the fact that the spectroscopy and lightcurves of st lmi were taken at different epochs when the object was in different states , which could affect the accretion geometry .",
    "in schwope et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the authors found that the polar mr serpentis appeared to show longitudinal migration of the accretion spot by @xmath13 30@xmath2 , as well as a 10@xmath2 shift in the magnetic colatitude between its high and low states .      in fig .",
    "8b , we present se - subtracted spex data obtained during our 2005 february 7 observing run , which show a conspicuous lack of cyclotron emission throughout the entire orbital cycle .",
    "the extreme low - state of st lmi is corroborated by near - epoch ( 2006 february 12 ) optical lightcurves obtained with the wiyn 0.9-m , showing the system in a deep low - state . despite the poor telluric correction ( the spectra were faint ) , the only strong feature in the bright - phase ( 0.50 @xmath35 0.85 ) is small `` bump '' longward of 2.2 @xmath34 m , caused by under subtraction of the secondary star at those phases . in this series of papers",

    "were eq cet , the prototype `` low - accretion rate polar '' , mq dra (= sdss 1553 ) , the prototype `` pre - polar '' , and ef eri , well known for its protracted low - state .",
    "intriguingly , in each of these objects strong cyclotron emission was observed , while the extreme low - state dataset of st lmi is the only example where cyclotron emission completely disappeared .",
    "a similar situation probably explains the 2006 feb 12 photometric low - state found by kafka et al .",
    "this suggests that normal polars can have periods that appear completely devoid of detectable accretion .",
    "we obtained a full orbit of phase - resolved ir spectra for both am her and st lmi .",
    "we found both objects to be dominated by emission from the secondary in the ir . to remove this component , we utilized the fact that emission regions for both stars were self - eclipsed .",
    "thus , at each phase we subtract a dim - phase or `` stream - emission '' spectrum .",
    "because of the changing spectral type of the secondary , we found that medianing dim - phase spectra over @xmath13 25 % of an orbit produced a better subtraction .",
    "for am her , we found a phase averaged model of : b = 13.6@xmath38 mg , kt = 4.0@xmath39 kev ( see table 2 for specifics at each phase ) .",
    "additionally , we found that the viewing angle varied in a manner consistent with expectations from a system with @xmath1 = 50@xmath2 and @xmath3 = 85@xmath2 .",
    "for st lmi , we collected two datasets .",
    "the first had st lmi in a low - state with @xmath12 @xmath13 17.4 , and displayed weak cyclotron harmonics that were difficult to decouple from the water vapor signatures leftover after se - subtraction .",
    "we found a phase averaged model of : b= 12.1 @xmath9 0.5 mg , kt = 3.3 @xmath9 1.8 kev in an accretion region consistent with @xmath1 = 55@xmath2 and @xmath3 = 128@xmath2 .",
    "for st lmi , we include a second data set , taken when the object was in an `` extreme low - state '' showing no substantial cyclotron emission .",
    "the non - detection of cyclotron emission contrasts with our earlier data from both eq cet and mq dra both of which show cyclotron emission , even while being in extremely low - states .",
