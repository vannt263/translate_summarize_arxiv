    "the electronic properties of metals on the border of magnetic phase transitions at low temperatures are often found to exhibit temperature dependences that differ from the predictions of fermi liquid theory .",
    "early attempts to explore such non - fermi liquid behaviour have been based on mean - field treatments of the effects of enhanced magnetic fluctuations , as in the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) model.@xcite    in a recent work the prediction of this model for the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath0 was tested in a simple cubic d - metal , ni@xmath8al , at high pressures near to the critical pressure where ferromagnetism is suppressed.@xcite  the @xmath9 temperature dependence of the resistivity seen in ni@xmath8al and other related systems , where the magnetic correlation wavevector @xmath10 is small , appears to be largely consistent with the scr model.@xcite  in the idealized limit @xmath11 at @xmath12 , the scr model predicts that in 3d the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath13 varies linearly with the quasiparticle excitation energy , rather than quadratically as in the standard fermi liquid picture .",
    "this form of @xmath13 is similar to that of the marginal fermi liquid model,@xcite  which is normally associated with a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "however , at the border of ferromagnetism the relevant fluctuations responsible for quasiparticle scattering are of long wavelength and thus are ineffective in reducing the current .",
    "this leads to a transport relaxation rate @xmath14 that differs from @xmath13 and varies not as @xmath15 , but as @xmath9    temperature - composition phase diagram of nis@xmath4se@xmath5.@xcite  lower inset shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of nisse ( @xmath6 ) , which is just on the border of a metallic antiferromagnetic state at low temperatures.@xcite  the upper inset is the pyrite crystal structure of nis@xmath1 and nise@xmath1 .",

    "thus , nis@xmath1 at @xmath3 and nisse at ambient pressure may be expected to be similar except for the level of quenched disorder , which is normally higher in nisse than in nis@xmath1 .",
    "the residual resistivity of nisse is typically an order of magnitude higher than in nis@xmath1.,height=226 ]    in practice , this form of @xmath14 or of the resistivity @xmath0 can be restricted to a relatively narrow range of temperatures and pressures where @xmath10 is small compared with the characteristic wavevector of thermally excited magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the scr model is not restricted to this limit and can in principle include the effects of @xmath10 and even determine @xmath10 in a self - consistent fashion .",

    "the validity of this assumption has not been clearly confirmed theoretically , but seems to be consistent with experiment in the cases mentioned above . in its conventional form",
    "the model does not include the possible effects of inhomogeneities or texture that may arise on the border of first order ferromagnetic transitions as in , e.g. , mnsi.@xcite the scr model is also expected to fail on the border of electron localization , as near a mott transition or close to local quantum critical points in heavy electron compounds.@xcite    the applicability of the scr model has also been questioned for the case of itinerant - electron antiferromagnetism in general , even well away from the border of a mott transition.@xcite  in this paper we present an attempt to test the prediction of the scr model in a metal on the border of metallic antiferromagnetism in 3d for which @xmath16 is predicted to vary as @xmath17 in the idealized limit @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath18 now stands for the correlation wavevector for the staggered magnetization . the exponent of @xmath19 is the ratio of the spatial dimension @xmath20 and the dynamical exponent @xmath21 .",

    "this simple model for the scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations assumes that the scattering rate can be averaged over the fermi surface . within the scr model",
    "this procedure would seem to require the presence of a sufficient level of quenched disorder assumed to have only the simple consequence of inhibiting the short circuiting caused by the carrier on the cold spots of the fermi surface , i.e. , regions far from the hot spots connected by the antiferromagnetic ordering wavevector and thus strongly affected by spin - fluctuation scattering.@xcite the effect of quenched disorder on the temperature dependence of @xmath16 in the scr model shows up particularly clearly in the temperature - dependent resistivity exponent defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the residual resistivity , i.e. , the resistivity extrapolated to @xmath29  k. the resistivity exponent @xmath30 may be described in terms of the fermi wavevector @xmath31 , the elastic mean free path @xmath32 of charge carriers and the reduced temperature @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a characteristic spin fluctuation temperature.@xcitewith increasing @xmath35 , @xmath30 drops from @xmath19 towards unity around @xmath36 , back towards a value of the order of @xmath19 around @xmath37 and then towards zero for @xmath38.@xcite  this undulating behaviour of @xmath30 is a dramatic prediction of the model for relatively pure samples that could in principle be tested by studying a series of samples of the same material with different levels of quenched disorder .",
    "rosch@xcite  introduced this model in an effort to understand the temperature dependence of the resistivity exponent measured for the f - electron metal cepd@xmath1si@xmath1.@xcite  the results were , in this case , not entirely conclusive because of the anisotropic and complex nature of the spin fluctuation spectrum in this material .",
