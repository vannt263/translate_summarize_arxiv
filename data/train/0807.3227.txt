    "quantum interference of electrons in mesoscopic conductors manifests itself in a number of fundamentally important phenomena which can be directly observed in modern experiments .",
    "one of them is the phenomenon of weak localization ( wl ) @xcite . in the absence of interactions",
    "electron wave functions preserve their coherence and , hence , quantum interference remains efficient throughout a large part of the sample making wl a pronounced effect .",
    "interactions between electrons and with other degrees of freedom may limit phase coherence thereby making quantum interference of electrons possible only within a finite length scale @xmath8 .",
    "this so - called electron decoherence length as well as directly related to it decoherence time @xmath9 ( where @xmath7 is diffusion coefficient ) are crucial parameters indicating importance of quantum effects in the system under consideration .    at sufficiently high temperatures quantum behavior of electrons in disordered conductors",
    "is usually suppressed due to various types of interactions . however , as temperature gets lower , certain interaction mechanisms either `` freeze out '' or become less efficient in destroying quantum coherence . as a result , both @xmath8 and @xmath10 usually grow with decreasing temperature and quantum effects become progressively more important .    should one expect @xmath8 and @xmath10 to diverge in the limit @xmath0 ? while some authors tend to give a positive answer to this question , numerous experiments performed on virtually all kinds of disordered conductors and in all dimensions demonstrate just the opposite , i.e. that at low enough @xmath11 both decoherence length and time _ saturate _ to a constant and do not anymore grow if temperature decreases further .",
    "the list of corresponding structures and experiments , by far incomplete , includes quasi-1d metallic wires @xcite , quasi-1d semiconductors @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , 2d metallic @xcite and semiconductor @xcite films , various 3d disordered metals @xcite and ( 0d ) quantum dots @xcite .",
    "though dimensions and parameters of these systems are different , the low temperature saturation of @xmath10 remains the common feature of all these observations .",
    "is this ubiquitous saturation of @xmath10 an _ intrinsic _ or _ extrinsic _ effect ? if intrinsic , decoherence of electrons at @xmath12 would be a fundamentally important conclusion which would shed a new light on the physical nature of the ground state of disordered conductors as well as on their low temperature transport properties .",
    "while extrinsic saturation of @xmath10 could be caused by a variety of reasons , the choice of intrinsic dephasing mechanisms is , in fact , much more restricted",
    ". there exists , however , at least one mechanism , electron - electron interactions , which remains important down to lowest temperatures and may destroy quantum interference of electrons even at @xmath12 @xcite .    in a series of papers",
    "@xcite we offered a theoretical approach that allows to describe electron interference effects in the presence of disorder and electron - electron interactions at any temperature including the most interesting limit @xmath0 .",
    "this formalism extends chakravarty - schmid description @xcite of wl and generalizes feynman - vernon - caldeira - leggett path integral influence functional technique @xcite to fermionic systems with disorder and interactions . with the aid of our approach we have evaluated wl correction to conductance and electron decoherence time in the limit @xmath0 and demonstrated that low temperature saturation of @xmath10 can indeed be caused by electron - electron interactions .",
    "our results allowed for a direct comparison with experiments and a good agreement between our theory and numerous experimental data for @xmath10 in the low temperature limit was found @xcite .",
    "in particular , for quasi-1d wires with thicknesses exceeding the elastic electron mean free path @xmath13 at @xmath0 our theory predicts @xmath14 , where @xmath7 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this scaling is indeed observed in experiments for not very strongly disordered wires typically with @xmath15 @xmath16/s ( see sec . 6 for more details ) .    on the other hand , for strongly disordered structures with smaller values of @xmath7 this scaling is not anymore fulfilled and , moreover , an opposite trend is observed : @xmath10 was found _ to increase _ with decreasing @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this trend is _ not _ described by our expressions for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "another interesting scaling was observed in quantum dots : saturated values @xmath10 were argued @xcite to scale with the dot dwell times @xmath3 as @xmath17 .",
    "our theory @xcite can not be directly used in order to explain the latter scaling either .    in order to attempt to reconcile all these observations within one approach",
    "it is necessary to develop a unified theoretical description which would cover essentially all types of disordered conductors .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the technique @xcite is formally an exact procedure which should cover all situations .",
    "however , for some structures , such as , e.g. , quantum dots and granular metals , it can be rather difficult to directly evaluate the wl correction within this technique for the following reasons .",
    "first of all , our description in terms of quasiclassical electron trajectories may become insufficient in the above cases , and electron scattering on disorder should be treated on more general footing .",
    "another  purely technical  point is averaging over disorder .",
    "in our approach @xcite it is convenient to postpone disorder averaging until the last stage of the calculation . in some cases  like ones studied below  it might be , on the contrary , more appropriate to perform disorder averaging already in the beginning of the whole consideration .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to deal with the model which would embrace various types of conductors with well defined properties both in the long and short wavelength limits . this feature will help to construct a fully self - contained theory free of any divergencies and additional cutoff parameters .",
    "recently @xcite we made a first step towards this unified theory .",
    "namely , we adopted a model for a disordered conductor consisting of an array of ( metallic ) quantum dots connected via junctions ( scatterers ) with arbitrary transmission distribution of their conducting channels .",
    "this model allows to easily crossover between the limits of a granular metal and that with point - like impurities and to treat spatially restricted and spatially extended conductors within the same theoretical framework , as desired . within this model in ref .",
    "@xcite we analyzed wl corrections to conductance merely for non - interacting electrons and included interaction effects by introducing the electron dephasing time @xmath10 just as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "systematic analysis of the effect of electron - electron interactions on weak localization within this formalism will be developed in this paper .",
    "this approach will allow to microscopically evaluate @xmath10 for all the structures under consideration .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we will discuss qualitative arguments illustrating the role of scattering and interactions in electron dephasing . in sec .",
    "3 we introduce our model of an array of quantum dots and outline a general theoretical framework which is then employed in sec . 4 and 5 for rigorous calculations of the wl correction to conductance and electron decoherence time in the presence of electron - electron interactions . a detailed comparison of our results with numerous experiments performed in various disordered conductors is carried out in sec .",
    ". a brief summary of our main results and conclusions is presented in sec .",
    "before turning to a detailed calculation it is instructive to discuss a simple qualitative picture demonstrating under which conditions electron dephasing by interaction is expected to occur .     and @xmath18 are assumed to drop only across the barriers and not inside the dot.,width=200 ]    consider first the simplest system of two scatterers separated by a cavity ( quantum dot , fig .",
    "1 ) the wl correction to conductance of a disordered system @xmath19 is known to arise from interference of pairs of time - reversed electron paths @xcite . in the absence of interactions for a single quantum dot of fig .",
    "1 this correction is evaluated in a general form @xcite .",
    "the effect of electron - electron interactions can be described in terms of fluctuating voltages .",
    "let us assume that the voltage can drop only across the barriers and consider two time - reversed electron paths which cross the left barrier ( with fluctuating voltage @xmath20 ) twice at times @xmath21 and @xmath22 as shown in fig .",
    "it is easy to see that the voltage - dependent random phase factor @xmath23 acquired by the electron wave function @xmath24 along any path turns out to be exactly the same as that for its time - reversed counterpart .",
    "hence , in the product @xmath25 these random phases cancel each other and quantum coherence of electrons remains fully preserved .",
    "this implies that for the system of fig .",
    "1a fluctuating voltages ( which can mediate electron - electron interactions ) _ do not cause any dephasing_.    this qualitative conclusion can be verified by means of more rigorous considerations .",
    "for instance , it was demonstrated @xcite that the scattering matrix of the system remains unitary in the presence of electron - electron interactions , which implies that the only effect of such interactions is transmission renormalization but not electron decoherence . in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar conclusion was reached by directly evaluating the wl correction to the system conductance .",
    "thus , for the system of two scatterers of fig .",
    "1a electron - electron interactions can only yield energy dependent ( logarithmic at sufficiently low energies ) renormalization of the dot channel transmissions @xcite but not electron dephasing .    ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath18 are again assumed to drop only across the barriers.,width=283 ]    let us now add one more scatterer and consider the system of two quantum dots depicted in fig .",
    "we again assume that fluctuating voltages are concentrated at the barriers and not inside the cavities .",
    "the phase factor accumulated along the path ( see fig .",
    "2 ) which crosses the central barrier twice ( at times @xmath21 and @xmath27 ) and returns to the initial point ( at a time @xmath22 ) is @xmath28}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the fluctuating voltage across the central barrier . similarly , the phase factor picked up along the time - reversed path reads @xmath30}$ ] .",
    "hence , the overall phase factor acquired by the product @xmath25 for a pair of time - reversed paths is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 averaging over phase fluctuations , which for simplicity are assumed gaussian , we obtain @xmath33 where we defined the phase correlation function @xmath34 should this function grow with time the electron phase coherence decays and , hence , @xmath19 has to be suppressed below its non - interacting value due to interaction - induced electron decoherence .",
    "the above arguments are , of course , not specific to systems with three barriers only .",
    "they can also be applied to any system with larger number of scatterers , i.e. virtually to any disordered conductor where ",
    "exactly for the same reasons ",
    "one also expects non - vanishing interaction - induced electron decoherence at any temperature including @xmath12 . in the next sections we will develop a quantitative theory which will confirm and extend our qualitative physical picture .",
    "we are going to give a complete quantum mechanical analysis of the problem which fully accounts for fermi statistics of electrons and treats electron - electron interactions in terms quantum fields produced internally by fluctuating electrons . below we will non - perturbatively evaluate wl correction @xmath19 for arrays of metallic quantum dots in the presence of electron - electron interactions which will be shown to reduce phase coherence of electrons at any temperature down to @xmath12 .",

    "each quantum dot is characterized by its own mean level spacing @xmath37 .",
    "adjacent quantum dots are connected to each other via barriers which can scatter electrons .",
    "the first and the last dot are also connected to the leads ( with total resistance @xmath38 ) , i.e. altogether we have @xmath35 scatterers in our system .",
    "each such scatterer is described by a set of transmissions of its conducting channels @xmath39 ( here @xmath40 labels the channels and @xmath41 labels the scatterers ) .",

    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite we have already applied the model of fig . 3 in order to analyze wl effects in the absence of electron - electron interactions . in that paper",
    "we have used the scattering matrix formalism combined with the non - linear @xmath52-model . in order to incorporate interaction effects into our consideration",
    "it will be convenient for us to describe inter - dot electron transfer within the tunneling hamiltonian approach , as specified above .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this choice is only a matter of technical convenience , since the approaches based on the tunneling hamiltonian and on the scattering matrix are fully equivalent to each other .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us briefly remind the reader the relation between these two approaches .",
    "consider , e.g. , the @xmath41-th barrier between the @xmath50-th and @xmath41-th quantum dots and define the matrix elements @xmath53 between the @xmath54th wave function in the @xmath50-th dot and @xmath55th wave function in the @xmath41-th dot .",
    "electron transfer across this barrier can then be described by the set of eigenvalues of this matrix @xmath56 .",

    "let us first consider the system of three scatterers @xmath79 ( two quantum dots ) .",
    "this system is important both in the context of electron dephasing in quantum dots @xcite and as a relatively simple example which illustrates all significant features of the effect of electron - electron interactions on wl in more complicated systems .    here",
    "we will treat interaction effects practically _ without any approximations_. for the sake of simplicity we will assume that the central ( i.e. second ) barrier is a tunnel junction with @xmath80 for all its transmission channels .",

    "practically all data points are now located in - between the solid and dashed lines which indicate the dependence ( [ d3 ] ) with respectively @xmath422 and @xmath423 .",
    "we can not exclude that the remaining scatter among the data points with similar values of @xmath7  to a certain extent  may be due to relatively small amount of magnetic impurities possibly residing in some samples .",
    "also minor differences in metal parameters ( e.g , fermi velocities ) may contribute to this effect .",
    "it appears , however , that sample - to - sample fluctuations of the geometry parameter @xmath338 play the most important role .",
    "this parameter is defined as a ratio between the square root of the inter - dot ( inter - grain ) contact area @xmath424 and the average dot ( grain ) size @xmath425 , i.e. @xmath338 accounts for _ local _ properties of the sample which can be highly non - universal .",
    "electrons in metallic wires get scattered both in the bulk and on the surface .",
    "hence , e.g. , the surface quality and/or details of the wire geometry  along with other factors  may significantly impact the value of @xmath338 .",
    "since @xmath261 ( [ d3 ] ) depends quite strongly on @xmath338 , it is by no means surprising that different wires with similar values of @xmath7 may have decoherence times differing by few times .",
    "as an illustration of this point let us consider 4 quasi-1d aupd samples c , d , e , f @xcite with nominally identical values of @xmath426 @xmath16/s .",
    "although these samples were fabricated in the same way and measured in one experiment @xcite , their dephasing times were found to differ by up to @xmath427 times .",
    "this difference can hardly be ascribed to magnetic impurities since the measured level of dephasing would require unrealistically high concentration of such impurities ( in the range of 100 ppm ) and , in addition , rather exotic values of the kondo temperature @xmath373 . at the same time , sample - to - sample fluctuations of the parameter @xmath338 of only @xmath428 per cent ( which is easy to assume given , e.g. , somewhat different geometry of the samples ) would fully account for the above difference of dephasing times .",
    "we conclude that our theoretical expression ( [ d3 ] ) is in a good quantitative agreement with the available experimental data for quasi-1d metallic wires with diffusion coefficients in the range 9 @xmath16/s @xmath429 @xmath16/s .",
    "now let us return to fig .",
    "6 and consider the data for strongly disordered conductors with @xmath430 @xmath16/s . as we already pointed out , the agreement between the data and the dependence ( [ d-3 ] ) predicted within our simple model @xmath336 is reasonable , in particular for samples with @xmath431@xmath16/s . at higher diffusion coefficients",
    "most of the data points indicate a weaker dependence of @xmath261 on @xmath7 which appears natural in the vicinity of the crossover to the dependence ( [ d3 ] ) .",
    "the best fit for the whole range 0.3 @xmath16/s @xmath432 @xmath16/s is achieved with the function @xmath371 with the power @xmath433 .",
    "further modifications of our  clearly oversimplified ",
    "model @xmath336 can help to achieve even better agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "although such modifications can certainly be worked out , it is not our aim to do it here .",
    "more importantly , our analysis of sec .",
    "5.2 allows to qualitatively understand and explain seemingly contradicting dependencies of @xmath261 on @xmath7 observed in weakly and strongly disordered conductors .",
    "while the trend `` less disorder  less decoherence '' ( [ d3 ] ) for sufficiently clean conductors is quite obvious , the opposite trend `` more disorder  less decoherence '' in strongly disordered structures requires a comment .",
    "effectively the latter dependence implies that with increasing disorder electrons spend more time in the areas with fluctuating in time but spatially uniform potentials which do not dephase , as we also discussed in sec .",
    "2 . in other words , in this case an effective dwell time @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) becomes longer with increasing disorder and , hence , the electron decoherence time @xmath261 does so too .",
    "is the physical picture of @xmath7 _ decreasing _ with increasing dot ( or grain ) size ( employed within the model @xmath336 ) realistic ?",
    "although for cleaner conductors the tendency is usually just the opposite , for strongly disordered structures increasing resistivity with increasing grain size has been observed in a various experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , since local conductance fluctuations increase with increasing disorder , several grains can form a cluster with internal inter - grain conductances strongly exceeding those at its edges . in this case",
    "fluctuating potentials remain almost uniform inside the whole cluster which will then play a role of an effective ( bigger ) grain / dot . accordingly , the average volume of such `` composite dots '' @xmath434 may grow with increasing disorder , electrons will spend more time in such bigger dots and , hence , the electron decoherence time ( [ t1 ] ) will increase .",
    "the above comparison with experiments confirms that our previous quasiclassical results for @xmath261 @xcite are applicable to relatively weakly disordered structures with @xmath435 @xmath16/s , while for conductors with stronger disorder different expressions for @xmath261 ( e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ d-3 ] ) ) should be used .",
    "for instance , the claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite `` disagreement '' between our theory and some experiments by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude is solely due to misuse of our results @xcite far beyond their applicability range . a glance at fig . 6 is sufficient to realize that any attempt to apply eq .",
    "( [ d3 ] ) to structures with , e.g. , @xmath436 @xmath16/s can easily lead to a `` disagreement '' with the data , say , by 6 orders of magnitude or so .",
    "this observation , however , does not imply any real disagreement , rather it indicates that more general results for @xmath261 , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) , should be used .",
    "the same argument invalidates the comparison between our quasiclassical results @xcite and the data for the sample au-5 @xcite , see fig .",
    "@xcite , or , to a somewhat lesser extent , for the sample c of ref .",
    "@xcite , see table ii of that paper @xcite .",
    "finally , our analysis allows to rule out scattering on magnetic impurities as a cause of low temperature saturation of @xmath10 .",
    "this mechanism can explain neither strong and non - trivial dependence of the electron decoherence time on @xmath7 ( see our figs .",
    "6 and 7 as well as , e.g. , fig . 4 in @xcite , fig . 1 in @xcite and",
    "fig . 5 in @xcite ) nor",
    "even the level of dephasing observed in numerous experiments .",
    "e.g. , in order to be able to attribute dephasing times as short as @xmath437 s to magnetic impurities one needs to assume huge concentration of such impurities ranging from few _ hundreds _ to few _ thousands _ ppm which appears highly unrealistic , in particular for systems like carbon nanotubes , 2degs or quantum dots .",
    "similar arguments were independently emphasized by lin and coworkers @xcite . even in metallic wires with high values of @xmath7 and long dephasing times , at @xmath374 one observes clear saturation of @xmath10 @xcite which is in a _ quantitative _ agreement with our theory of electron - electron interactions ( see fig . 7 ) and is very hard to explain otherwise @xcite .",
    "thus , although electron dephasing due to scattering on magnetic impurities is by itself an interesting issue , its role in low temperature saturation of @xmath10 in disordered conductors is sometimes strongly overemphasized .",
    "since the latter phenomenon has been repeatedly observed in _ all _ types of disordered conductors , the physics behind it should most likely be universal and fundamental .",
    "we believe  and have demonstrated here  that it is indeed the case : zero temperature electron decoherence in all types of conductors discussed above is caused by electron - electron interactions .",
    "in this paper we have employed a model of an array of quantum dots / scatterers ( fig .",
    "3 ) which embraces various types of disordered conductors and allows to study electron transport in the presence of interactions within a very general theoretical framework .",
    "we have non - perturbatively analyzed the impact of electron - electron interactions on weak localization for such structures with the emphasis put on the interaction - induced decoherence of electrons at low temperatures .",
    "we have formulated a fully self - contained theory free of any divergencies and cutoffs which allows to conveniently handle disorder averaging and treat electron scattering without residing to quasiclassics . in the case of two quantum dots ( or three scatterers )",
    "it was possible to find an exact solution of the problem ( sec .",
    "4 ) and to evaluate the wl correction to the system conductance practically without approximations .    with the aid of our approach",
    "we have formulated a unified description of electron dephasing by coulomb interaction in different structures including ( i ) weakly disordered conductors ( e.g. , metallic wires with @xmath15 @xmath16/s ) , ( ii ) strongly disordered conductors ( @xmath370 @xmath16/s ) and ( iii ) metallic quantum dots .",
    "we have demonstrated that in all these cases at @xmath0 the electron decoherence time is determined by the same simple formula @xmath438 . in the case ( i )",
    "this formula yields @xmath439 and matches with our previous quasiclassical results @xcite while in the cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) it illustrates new physics which was not yet explored before .",
    "in particular , this formula emphasizes the dependence of @xmath261 on the electron dwell time @xmath3 in single quantum dots @xcite and helps to understand the ( at the first sight counterintuitive ) trend `` more disorder ",
    "less decoherence '' observed in strongly disordered conductors @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a detailed comparison of our theoretical predictions with the results of numerous experiments for the whole scope of structures ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) ( sec .",
    "6 ) . in all cases",
    "we found a good agreement between theory and experiment which further supports our main conclusion that low temperature saturation of @xmath10 is universally caused by electron - electron interactions .",
