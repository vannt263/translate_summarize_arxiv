    "the quest for supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at @xmath16 has been a remarkable success @xcite . however , the detection of such smbhs as massive as @xmath17 at such early epochs with cosmic age @xmath18 gyr has opened a number of questions that remain essentially unanswered .",
    "black holes ( bhs ) grow from an initial seed by accreting the surrounding gas .",
    "naive smbh seed candidates are stellar - mass bhs formed after the death of massive ( possibly pop iii ) stars , with a typical mass @xmath19 or even smaller @xcite . however , even assuming a continuous accretion at the eddington limit , the time required to grow a @xmath20 smbh by @xmath21 is comparable or even longer than the hubble time at that redshift .",
    "even worse , in the early evolutionary stages , radiative feedback reduces the accretion rate significantly . as a result , for most of the time the bh grows slowly @xcite .",
    "furthermore , reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) may also significantly hamper the growth process @xcite .    to overcome these problems , an alternative scenario in which a smbh grows from a seed more massive than @xmath22",
    "has become popular ( see e.g. review ) .",
    "such massive seeds are nicely produced by the so - called  direct collapse \" process occurring in metal - free atomic - cooling halos with virial temperature @xmath23  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "if in these halos @xmath1 formation and cooling is suppressed , metal - free gas can only cool via ly@xmath24 radiation that becomes inefficient when the gas cools below @xmath25 k. then , the gas contracts almost isothermally with @xmath26 k and avoids fragmentation during the cloud collapse @xcite .",
    "eventually at the center a bh with mass @xmath27 forms @xcite .",
    "thereafter such a direct collapse black hole ( dcbh ) continues to accrete the gas and may merge with other bhs .",
    "a fully - fledged smbh is then produced in time scale much shorter than the hubble time .    the suppression of h@xmath28 formation requires either a strong lyman - werner ( lw , @xmath29 ev ) uv radiation field that directly dissociates h@xmath28 , or a strong continuum radiation field from near - infrared ( nir ) to uv band ( @xmath30 ev ) that detaches the most important @xmath1 formation catalyst , h@xmath31 .",
    "the required critical field intensity and the clustering of the dark matter halos determine the actual abundance of dcbhs in high-@xmath10 universe @xcite .",
    "the dcbh abundance has been studied by many authors and the predicted number density at @xmath32 ranges from @xmath33 mpc@xmath15 to @xmath34 mpc@xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless such number density is much smaller than that of galaxies in the high-@xmath10 universe .",
    "generally , in this scenario the required critical field intensity is very high .",
    "for an ideal blackbody spectrum with effective temperature @xmath35 k , @xmath36 @xcite ; for a realistic galaxy spectrum @xmath37 @xcite , where @xmath38 is the specific intensity of the radiation field at 13.6 ev and in units @xmath39 erg s@xmath14@xmath5hz@xmath14sr@xmath14 . such a strong radiation field can be attained only when the radiation source is very close to the dcbh - forming gas cloud . in spite of this stringent requirement ,",
    "the discovery of two high-@xmath10 dcbh candidates in the candels / goods - s survey has been recently reported @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the lyman alpha emitter ( lae )  cr7 \" has been observed and reported as a dcbh candidate by some authors , because its strong ly@xmath24 and heii 1640    line luminosities are hard to be provided by pop iii stars ; and the two nearby pop ii galaxies are ideal sources for providing strong external radiation , although this detection is still a matter of debate ( @xcite ; pacucci et al .",
    "2016 , in prep ) .",
    "in @xcite we proposed that an accreting and compton - thick dcbh can provide a radiation field that suppresses h@xmath28 formation in a more efficient way compared with a galaxy .",
    "the advantages here are : the ratio of the h@xmath31 photo - detachment rate to the h@xmath28 photo - dissociation rate is a most straightforward indicator of the h@xmath28 suppression efficiency @xcite , for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a compton - thick dcbh this ratio is higher than for normal star - forming galaxies ; and a bh is usually brighter than a galaxy .",
    "moreover , there is an additional advantage : if the source also produces x - ray and ionizing photons , in general it may hamper dcbh formation @xcite ; however if the source is a compton - thick dcbh , except a few very hard x - ray photons ( i.e. @xmath40 10 kev ) during most of the accretion stage it does not emit x - rays and ionizing photons . in this case , the abundance of high-@xmath10 dcbhs can be higher than currently expected .    in this work ,",
    "we derive the critical field intensity for the formation of a new dcbh inside a collapsing gas cloud irradiated by a nearby previously - formed dcbh by means of the one - zone model in which the whole cloud is assumed to have uniform properties .",
    "the seds of the dcbh are taken from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we consider three sed models with _ initial _ column number densities @xmath41 @xmath5 , @xmath42 @xmath5 and @xmath43 @xmath5 respectively . throughout",
    "this paper @xmath2 refers to the column number density of the gas envelope that encloses the accretion disc , at the time when accretion just starts .",
    "the real column density filtering the bh radiation is time - dependent and decreases as accretion processes .",
    "regarding the x - ray radiation , although during most of its accretion process the nearby dcbh only emits hard x - ray photons that negligibly influence the h@xmath28 formation , the collective x - ray emission from distant dcbhs and galaxies builds up a high-@xmath10 x - ray background ( xrb ) that ionizes the gas and may promote the @xmath1 formation .",
    "we also investigate the impact of such high-@xmath10 xrb on the dcbh formation .",

    "we introduce the one - zone model and the dcbh seds . in section [ results ]",
