    "+ a possible improvement could be provided by the finite charging energy of the nanowire , which raises the energy of all the states and lifts the huge degeneracy of quasiparticle states close to @xmath33 . for a single pair of majorana states , the charging energy also introduces an undesired splitting between the filled and unfilled zero - energy state .",

    "<S> we consider the problem of quasiparticle poisoning in a nanowire - based realization of a majorana qubit , where a spin - orbit - coupled semiconducting wire is placed on top of a ( bulk ) superconductor . by making use of recent experimental data exhibiting evidence of a low - temperature residual non - equilibrium quasiparticle population in superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> we show by means of analytical and numerical calculations that the dephasing time due to the tunneling of quasiparticles into the nanowire may be problematically short to allow for qubit manipulation .    devising a physical system where to experimentally observe for the first time the presence of majorana fermions has become in the last years a serious and stirring challenge in the condensed - matter physics community . apart from the importance _ </S>",
    "<S> per se _ of observing the signature a majorana fermion , the strong hope is to realize a majorana - based qubit , which would offer an intrinsically improved protection against decoherence due to the peculiar delocalized structure of the majorana state itself . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the setup we consider,@xcite a topological superconducting state ( tsc ) in a semiconducting nanowire is created , with a mid - gap mode @xmath0 at energy @xmath1 , whose wavefunction is strongly localized at the two ends of the nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> such topological state can be induced through the combined effect of @xmath2wave pairing , spin - orbit coupling and magnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting pairing is inherited most typically via proximity effect from a bulk superconductor placed below the wire ( around the wire in some proposals ) . even without restricting ourselves to this specific setup , superconductivity is a key ingredient needed in essentially all the proposals to produce observable majorana excitations in condensed - matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> the considerations we make in this paper are thus qualitatively valid and relevant for a wide range of configurations , while the quantitative results are specific to the proximized nanowire setup .    </S>",
    "<S> the zero - energy many - body excitation @xmath3 in the tsc can be exploited to store information in an ideally dephasing - free qubit . defining the @xmath4 state as the many - body state where the @xmath3 is empty , and correspondingly @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the subspace spanned by @xmath4 and @xmath6 is a degenerate ground - state subspace , which offers intrinsic protection against dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> however , coherent states of the type @xmath7 can not be prepared , because there is no physical coupling which could create such superposition . strictly speaking , then </S>",
    "<S> , a system where the states @xmath4 and @xmath6 differ by fermion parity ( occupation of a single bcs - like mode ) can not be used as a qubit . to obtain a proper quantum bit </S>",
    "<S> , one needs at least two of these zero - energy states , that is , four majorana fermions . in such case , there are four degenerate states : @xmath8 the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( possible choice for the qubit ) share now the same fermion parity , and if we choose them as qubit computational states , coherent superpositions are possible thanks to the superconducting pairing which induces fluctuations in the number of electrons , in jumps of two , due to the hopping in and out of cooper pairs .    if the superconductor can only exchange cooper pairs and not single , unpaired electrons with the wire , then the fermion parity ( _ i.e .  _ </S>",
    "<S> the number of electrons modulo two ) is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> this is at the base of the protection these systems benefit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if instead single electrons could enter the nanowire , then the system would be driven out of the topological subspace @xmath11 , populating @xmath12 , @xmath13 or some higher - energy states . in the case of a single tsc segment , with only one zero - energy mode , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of unpaired electrons would instead cause @xmath14 errors , causing transitions @xmath15 and viceversa .    </S>",
    "<S> there have already been a couple of works  @xcite pointing out that majorana - based qubits are prone to standard decoherence mechanisms when one allows for single - electron tunneling from a generic external ( noisy ) environment . </S>",
    "<S> the specific phenomenon of the possible disturbing presence of unpaired electrons in the superconductor , dubbed `` quasiparticle poisoning '' , constitutes a similar but more subtle problem , since the tunneling electrons are coming from the superconductor itself , which is an indispensable ingredient in these type of proposals . </S>",
    "<S> the issue has already been taken into consideration in the majorana - fermion community  @xcite but , to the best of our knowledge , no explicit estimation has been made for a specific setup . </S>",
    "<S> rather , some estimates for quasiparticle tunneling rate from the superconductor into the wire have been borrowed from some recent experiments dealing with equilibrium superconductivity  @xcite . in such experiments , like in several other investigations before  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , low - temperature quasiparticle poisoning has been observed , and evidence has been provided that the quasiparticle density does not drop to zero at the smallest temperatures , as predicted by theory , but rather saturates to a constant value . a clear and widely accepted explanation for this phenomenon is still lacking , but the observation of excess quasiparticles has been repeatedly confirmed . for instance , a very recent experimental investigation on quasiparticle kinetics inducing energy relaxation in a transmon qubit has measured poisoning times below @xmath16s  @xcite .    in an ideal superconductor at zero temperature all the electrons are forming cooper pairs and out of the condensate no quasiparticles exist  @xcite . at finite but small temperature , the average density of quasiparticles in a superconductor _ at equilibrium _ follows the activation behavior ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 valid at @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the normal - state , single - spin density of states at the fermi level , @xmath21 the temperature and @xmath22 the energy gap of the superconductor . the corresponding average quasiparticle recombination time ( lifetime ) </S>",
    "<S> is evaluated as  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the critical temperature of the superconductor and @xmath25 a material dependent , characteristic electron - phonon interaction time . </S>",
    "<S> eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : nqp ] ) and  ( [ eq : taur ] ) predict a very low quasiparticle density and correspondingly a very long quasiparticle lifetime at temperatures @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> as anticipated above , experimental data show agreement to the exponential behavior eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : taur ] ) only for not - too - low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the work ref .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] obtains a zero - temperature saturation @xmath27 ms in the quasiparticle lifetime for temperatures below 160 mk , and a corresponding saturating quasiparticle density @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> these large quaisparticles lifetimes of the order of ms have been sometimes used in the literature as an estimate for the tunneling rate of quasiparticles into the tsc nanowire , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ an estimate for the qubit lifetime , leading to the conclusion that quasiparticle poisoning is not a serious issue .    such experiments  @xcite , however , analyze the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath29 in an isolated superconducting system ( two - dimensional in the case of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] ) , and not in a hybrid structure where two subsystems are put into contact , and a subsystem can be poisoned by the other one .    here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that the rate of tunneling into the qubit subsystem ( the nanowire ) , and thus the average dephasing time of our majorana qubit , is _ not _ given by the quasiparticles lifetime as measured in an isolated superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for example in the case of our sc / tsc junction , quasiparticles in the superconducting reservoir can well tunnel into the tsc wire and tunnel out again , many times before a recombination event may take place after the typical time @xmath29 . since even a single detour of the quasiparticle into the qubit part of the system could destroy the coherence of the qubit itself , it is important to calculate or measure explicitly the tunneling rate of quasiparticles @xmath30 into the nanowire . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt a well - established formalism , already employed in earlier calculations for @xmath30 which were performed for the case of josephson qubits , adapting them to the present case of a sc interfaced to a tsc nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , depending on the parameters , the tunneling rate of quasiparticles can vary in the range @xmath31 mhz , imposing therefore a much more serious constraint on the feasibility of error - free qubit manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes particularly clear in the last section of this paper , where we produce quantitative estimates for the poisoning rate in typical configurations , and we compare them with the time scales required for adiabatic computations . </S>"
