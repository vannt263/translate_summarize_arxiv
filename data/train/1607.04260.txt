    "according to recent _ kepler _ statistics , most of the population of known transiting planets ( including planetary candidates ) around gfkm stars is dominated by planets of size between one and four earth radii ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . from small to large , those planets can be basically categorized into earth - size planets , super - earths and mini - neptunes ( @xcite ) .",
    "many of them are expected to harbor atmospheres , several of which have been characterized , including gj1214b ( @xcite ) , gj436b ( @xcite ) , hd 97658b ( @xcite ) , gj 3470b ( @xcite ) , and hat - p-11b ( @xcite ) . when the planet is smaller than jupiter and especially neptune or uranus , the atmosphere might no longer be solely dominated by hydrogen ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "compositional diversity of the atmospheres emerges , as seen on the terrestrial planets in the solar system .",
    "however , identifying the compositions of those atmospheres is difficult because the transit spectroscopic measurements are influenced by hazes or clouds .",
    "in fact , four out of the above five planets show featureless transmission spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , except hat - p-11b that exhibits water absorption in a hydrogen environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , the observable outer envelopes of the atmospheres of the sub - jupiter - size planets could exhibit a variety of compositions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the primordial constituents of the atmosphere are mostly determined by the metallicity of the protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the details of gas accretion during planetary formation , location of the planetary formation , and subsequent migration tracks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the atmospheric bulk compositions will also be greatly influenced by many processes during evolution after planetary formation .",
    "those processes include planetary and asteroid impacts , volcanism and outgassing ( @xcite ) , plate tectonics ( @xcite ) , atmosphere - surface interaction , atmosphere - ocean exchange , atmospheric escape ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and possible biospheric processes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "atmospheric dynamics and chemistry will also play significant roles in determining the observable atmospheric composition ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    as a result",
    ", we expect to observe a large compositional diversity among sub - jupiter - size exoplanets . there could be hydrogen - dominated atmospheres as on jupiter and hot jupiters ; more metal - rich ( but still hydrogen - dominated ) atmospheres like uranus and neptune ; evaporated atmospheres dominated by helium ( proposed for gj436b , @xcite ) ; or carbon dioxide atmosphere like those of venus and mars ; water worlds ( proposed for gj1214b , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; nitrogen and oxygen atmosphere like earth ; nitrogen and methane atmosphere like saturn s moon titan ; atmosphere of sulfur compounds like jupiter s moon io , carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon atmospheres ( @xcite ) , or some metallic - based or silicon - based atmospheres if the planet is very close to the host star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more quantitatively , given the metallicity and effective temperature , thermochemical and photochemical calculations have predicted a variety of possible bulk constituents for exo - planetary atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most known exoplanets are close to their host stars and expected to be tidally locked with a synchronized rotation around the central star .",
    "weather on those planets is intriguing .",
    "however , to date , there has not been a systematic study on bulk composition effects on the atmospheric dynamics and general circulation of tidally locked planets .",
    "previous studies mostly focused on the hydrogen atmospheres of hot jupiters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and earth - like environments for earth - size planets in the habitable zone ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has considered the effect of different atmospheric opacity sources on the general circulation for gj436b , but the bulk composition of the atmosphere is still hydrogen .",
    "recently , the dynamical simulations by @xcite for super - earth gj1214b illustrate the effects of metallicity and possible compositions on the atmospheric dynamics .",
    "it is found that atmospheres with a lower mean - molecular weight have smaller day - night and equator - to - polar temperature contrast than higher mean - molecular weight atmospheres .",
    "they also show that a water atmosphere exhibits an equatorial prograde jet , but a carbon - dioxide atmosphere is dominated two high - latitude jets , suggesting significant bulk composition effects on the atmospheric dynamics .",
    "there are three important properties of an atmospheric species that could influence the atmospheric dynamics : opacity , molecular weight , and heat capacity .",
    "opacity fundamentally controls the heating and cooling rates in the atmosphere , which drives the dynamics .",
    "molecular weight greatly affects the scale height of an atmosphere , the buoyancy frequency , atmospheric wave properties such as gravity wave speed , and the deformation radius , which is a typical dynamical length scale in the atmosphere .",
    "heat capacity also affects the radiative heating and cooling rates , buoyancy , wave speed and deformation radius , but in a different way from that of the molecular weight .",
    "given the complicated roles the bulk composition could play , it is difficult to disentangle the underlying mechanisms if we consider all those effects together . instead",
    ", here we use an idealized general circulation model ( gcm ) to study individual effects .",
    "specifically , we investigate the effects of the molecular weight and heat capacity while holding fixed the day - night heating scheme .",
    "note that gas opacity is commonly dominated by trace species that do not significantly affect the molecular mass , e.g. , water and carbon dioxide in the case of earth ; water , carbon monoxide , and methane in the case of hot jupiters .",
    "jupiter itself has significant opacity contribution from the background hydrogen , but also from trace hydrocarbons including methane , ethane , and acetylene ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we leave a thorough investigation of the opacity effect for the future .",

    "we aim to build quantitative theories for the bulk composition effects using a series of analytical expressions and predict some observable signatures , including the spatial maps of wind and temperature , day - night temperature differences and thermal phase curves .",
    "it is expected that the atmospheric dynamics will have significant effects on these observables",
    ". for tidally locked planets , the day - night temperature difference and the shape of the thermal phase curve can be greatly influenced by the day - night heat redistribution efficiency and the presence of an equatorial prograde jet ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the atmospheric wind speed might be directly measured through ultra - high resolution doppler mapping techniques that have been applied to hot jupiter hd209458b ( @xcite ) and hd189733b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "measuring phase curves and winds might provide some hints on the properties of the bulk composition in the atmosphere .",
    "this may serve as an alternative way to overcome the current difficulties in determining the atmospheric composition of transiting super - earths / mini - neptunes that exhibit featureless spectra , such as gj1214b .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will first provide some theoretical background on the effects of compositions on atmospheric dynamics .",
    "we will introduce the atmospheric circulation model and qualitatively summarize the main results from our simulations in section 3 .",
    "then we will dig into the underlying physical mechanisms by which the temperature and wind patterns are affected by molecular weight ( section 4 ) and molar heat capacity ( section 5 ) .",
    "we will also derive a series of analytical expressions to interpret the simulation results .",
    "this paper ends with a conclusion and implications for the observations in section 6 .",
    "the analytical treatment of temperature , wind and thermal phase shift are detailed in the appendices .",
    "thermochemical and photochemical models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) predict a variety of possible bulk constituents , depending on the metallically of the atmosphere , carbon to oxygen ratio , stellar flux , and atmospheric evolution .",
    "plausible constituents exhibit a wide range of mean - molecular weight ( @xmath11 ) and molar heat capacity at constant pressure ( @xmath12 ) , summarized in table 1 and fig .",
    "1 . molecular weight can vary by a factor of @xmath1320 , from @xmath14 to @xmath15.the heat capacity , however , can only vary by a factor of @xmath134 , from @xmath16 for helium to about @xmath17 for high - temperature methane , where @xmath18 is the molar gas constant .",
    "the molecular weight and molar heat capacity are independent properties of a gas molecule .",
    "the latter is solely controlled by the degrees of freedom of the molecule . the monatomic gas , helium , which could conceivably comprise the background atmospheric gas as a result of atmospheric escape processes ( @xcite ) , has the lowest @xmath12 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "diatomic gases , such as hydrogen , carbon monoxide , nitrogen and oxygen , have molar heat capacities ranging from @xmath19 at low temperature up to @xmath20 at high temperature for the vibrational modes to be fully excited .",
    "multi - atomic molecules , such as a triatomic linear molecule carbon dioxide and more complex - structured molecules like water and methane , usually contain a larger number of degrees of freedom and therefore span a large range of @xmath12 .",
    "for example , the molar heat capacity of methane can reach more than @xmath17 at 2000 k , although thermochemical equilibrium prefers forming carbon monoxide instead of methane at high temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from thermochemical calculations , co and @xmath21 will never dominate the bulk atmosphere , but their contribution to the mean molecular weight and molar heat capacity could be significant .      through what physical mechanisms",
    "could the molecular weight and molar heat capacity influence the atmospheric dynamics on a tidally locked planet , including observational signatures such as temperature and wind speed ?",
    "for a tidally locked planet in the moderate temperature range , if the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) effect can be ignored , the photospheric dynamics is approximately governed by the hydrostatic primitive equations . in pressure ( @xmath22 )",
    "coordinate , the equations are :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is density ; @xmath11 is molecular weight ; @xmath25 is temperature ; @xmath12 is molar heat capacity in units of @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is vertical velocity ; @xmath28 is geopotential where @xmath29 is gravitational acceleration and @xmath30 is altitude ; @xmath31 is coriolis parameter where @xmath32 is the planetary rotation rate and @xmath33 is latitude ; @xmath34 is the horizontal gradient at constant pressure ; @xmath35 is the horizontal velocity at constant pressure where @xmath36 is the zonal ( east - west ) velocity and @xmath37 is the meridional ( north - south ) velocity ; @xmath38 is the radiative heating / cooling rate in units of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the material derivative ; @xmath41 is a drag term representing missing physics such as sub - grid turbulent mixing ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both the molecular weight and molar heat capacity appear in the thermodynamic equation ( 1d ) and the molecular weight is also present the equation of state ( 1e ) .",
    "a change of the thermodynamic properties in the atmosphere ( e.g. , temperature ) will directly feed back to the geopotential field and lead to a change of atmospheric motion .",
    "the major effects on the atmospheric dynamics can be categorized into radiative effects and dynamical effects .",
    "the radiative heating and cooling is the primary driving force of the atmospheric dynamics on tidally locked planets . in principle",
    ", the three - dimensional profiles of heating and cooling ( e.g. , the strength and pressure - dependence of the dayside heating and nightside cooling ) are affected by opacities and therefore composition . as noted before",
    ", we do not investigate the opacity effect in this study . in order to isolate the effect of composition on the opacity from the other bulk composition effects , the simulations in this study share the same reference properties such as",
    "atmospheric opacity , planetary effective temperature , planetary mass , planetary radius , the same distance from the same host star and same cooling mechanism , but only differ in bulk compositions .",
    "the temperature change due to radiative heating and cooling also depends on the molecular weight and molar heat capacity ( eq . 1d ) .",
    "a higher molecular weight implies less molecules at a given pressure , resulting a greater temperature change rate , or equivalently a smaller radiative timescale .",
    "a higher molar heat capacity suggests that the atmosphere is more difficult to be heated and cooled , leading to a larger radiative timescale .",
    "for example , the radiative timescale in a hydrogen atmosphere is more than 15 times longer than the @xmath1 atmosphere solely due to the effects of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamical effect is also significant .",
    "a typical dynamical timescale in the atmosphere is the wave propagation timescale @xmath42 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath43 is a typical horizontal length scale ( e.g. , radius of the planet ) , @xmath44 is the buoyancy frequency ( brunt - v@xmath45is@xmath45l@xmath45 frequency ) of the atmosphere , and @xmath46 is the pressure scale height .",

    "an exception occurs if the temperature profile is close to an adiabat , because in that situation , @xmath52 is close to @xmath53 in eq .",
    "small variations in @xmath12 can cause large fractional variations in the factor in square brackets , and therefore large fractional changes to the wave speeds and possibly the entire dynamic regime .",

    "is complicated and often leads to noticeable effects on atmospheric dynamics .",
    "@xcite showed that hot jupiters should experience two distinct circulation regimes depending on the relative importance of wave propagation and radiative relaxation .",
    "if the radiative timescale is sufficiently short compared with wave propagation timescale , the waves will be damped and jet formation will be inhibited ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore the general circulation pattern in the atmosphere is dominated by a substellar - to - antistellar ( day - to - night ) divergent flow pattern instead of the equatorial zonal jet . in this situation , there is a large day - night temperature difference and small atmospheric hot spot shift in the thermal phase curve . on the other hand ,",
    "if the radiative timescale is sufficiently long compared with wave propagation timescale , the atmospheric flow will self - organize to form a zonal jet pattern .",
    "if we assume the radiative timescale increases with pressure , as generally it does ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the general circulation pattern in the atmosphere is expected to exhibit a  regime shift \" from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet - dominated regime in the deeper atmosphere .",
    "just such a transition in fact occurs in gcm simulations of hot jupiters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an intuitive measure of this transition is the ratio of radiative timescale versus the wave propagation timescale : @xmath67 , and both the molecular weight and molar heat capacity play important roles in this ratio .",
    "to quantitatively understand the above effects on a tidally locked planet , we simulate the atmospheric circulation using a three - dimensional ( 3d ) general circulation model ( mitgcm ) that has been extensively used in studying atmospheric dynamics on planets in and out of the solar system ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for simplicity ,",

    "the equilibrium temperature difference @xmath84 is 600 k at the top of the atmosphere and decreases towards zero at the bottom in a linear fashion with @xmath85 .",
    "the mean temperature @xmath86 is calculated using a simplified radiative scheme from @xcite ( fig .",
    "the vertical temperature profile is designed to be stably stratified , meaning that its vertical gradient , @xmath87 , does not exceed @xmath52 for all compositions .     and",
    "@xmath88).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we assume a linear drag scheme in the momentum equation ( eq .",

    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that the day - night temperature difference is controlled by several intrinsic timescales in the atmosphere , including the rotational timescale , radiative timescale , wave propagation timescale , horizontal and vertical advection timescale , and the frictional drag timescale ( if drag is present ) . by combining the horizontal momentum equation and the thermodynamic energy equation under the `` weak temperature gradient '' ( wtg ) approximation ( @xcite ) ,",

    "this theory implies that in the limit of very high molecular mass ( @xmath122 ) , the atmospheric temperature structure tends toward radiative equilibrium .",

    "this same discrepancy between model and theory have been seen in hydrogen atmosphere simulations ( hot jupiters ) in @xcite with large drag timescale and radiation timescale , and fig .",

    "<S> super earths and mini neptunes likely have a wide range of atmospheric compositions , ranging from low - molecular mass atmospheres of @xmath0 to higher molecular atmospheres of water , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or other species </S>",
    "<S> . the effect of atmospheric composition and molecular mass on the transit spectra have been extensively investigated , but almost no attention has been paid to the question of how molecular mass and composition affect the underlying atmospheric dynamics . here , we systematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub - jupiter - sized planets , using an idealized three - dimensional general circulation model ( gcm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk composition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent variables : molecular weight and molar heat capacity . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of molecular weight dominates . </S>",
    "<S> as the molecular weight increases , the atmosphere tends to have a larger day - night temperature contrast , a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the equatorial super - rotating jet also becomes narrower and the  jet core \" region , where the zonal - mean jet speed maximizes , moves to a greater pressure level . </S>",
    "<S> the zonal - mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher - molecular - weight atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small . </S>",
    "<S> but if the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic , molar heat capacity will play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet - dominated flow in the lower atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> six possible observables exhibit trends with molecular weight in our simulations : </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) day - night temperature difference ; ( ii ) thermal phase shift ; ( iii ) root - mean - square of the wind speed ; ( iv ) latitudinal widths of the equatorial jets ; and ( v ) pressure of the jet core region ; and ( vi ) maximum zonal - mean zonal jet speed </S>",
    "<S> . we also present analytical theories that quantitatively explain the above trends . </S>",
    "<S> those observables could be used to indirectly determine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub - jupiter - sized planets . </S>"
