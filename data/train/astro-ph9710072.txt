    "the extragalactic diffuse ir background has long been recognized to contain important information about the evolution of galaxies .",
    "more recently , studies of the ir background have become important to very - high - energy astronomers because pair - production interactions of multi - tev with extragalactic ir photons are an important source of extinction of extragalactic ( stecker & de jager 1977a and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , one empirical way to determine the ir background flux is to look for absorption of tev in the spectra of blazars ( stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ) .",
    "stecker , puget & fazio ( 1977 ) made an early estimate of the extragalactic ir background and showed that if galaxies radiate a significant fraction of their energy from stellar nucleosynthesis in the mid to far ir range , the background flux would be of the order of 10 nw m@xmath0sr@xmath1 .",
    "the cobe - dirbe detector has now obtained extragalactic residual flux measurements which approach or reach this range ( hauser 1996 ) .",
    "there have been many attempts to model the expected ir background from galaxies ; they have recently been reviewed by lonsdale ( 1996 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we take an alternate approach . rather than modeling the ir emission from galaxies using assumptions such as theoretical dust temperature distributions",
    ", we base our calculations on empirical studies of the ir spectra of galaxies with a wide distribution of intrinsic luminosities , and on empirically determined luminosity functions for these galaxies .",
    "the starlight spectra of all but the youngest galaxies have a peak in @xmath4 from red giants around 11.5 , and drop as a jeans tail at wavelengths longer than 2 . at wavelengths longer than 3 ,",
    "spiral galaxies emit by thermal radiation from dust grains , which are warmed to a very wide range of temperatures , from a minimum of 1520 k to a maximum which can exceed 800 k ( joseph , meikle , robertson & wright 1984 ) . because of this very large temperature range",
    ", modelling of the diffuse mod - ir and far - ir background from thermal dust emission from a large sample of galaxies by choosing one , or even two temperatures is not realistic .",
    "this is why our empirical appoach is preferable to what has been done previously .",
    "observations with the infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ) , combined with other data , have indicated that the infrared ( 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 hz ) spectra of all types of spiral galaxies depend systematically on their total luminosity .",
    "there are well - determined relations between the luminosity emitted in a given infrared waveband with the luminosity at 60@xmath7 m .",
    "spinoglio , ( 1995 ) established tight empirical correlations relating 100 , 60 , 25 , 12and 1.22.2(nir ) luminosities with the bolometric luminosity of seyfert and non - seyfert galaxies .",
    "we have combined these relations so that for any given value of @xmath8 or @xmath9 , we can predict the luminosities at all other infrared wavelengths .",
    "the luminosities at 2.2 and 3.5 in @xmath10 were estimated from the relation for @xmath11 ( given in watts ) , as @xmath12 = 2.05 @xmath13 for seyfert 1 galaxies , @xmath14 for seyfert 2 galaxies , and @xmath15 for non - seyfert galaxies .",
    "we have extrapolated to wavelengths longer than 100using the correlation of far - infrared color temperature with the parameter @xmath16 given by spinoglio , ( 1995 ) in their appendix b , derived from far - infrared photometry data obtained from the kuiper airborne observatory .",
    "luminosities at all other wavelengths were then estimated by linear interpolation in @xmath17 versus @xmath18 .",
    "the largest proportions of hot dust are found in galaxies with the highest rates of current star formation .",
    "this results in a systematic trend for more luminous galaxies to emit relatively hotter infrared spectra .",
    "we illustrate this gradual trend in figure 1 , which shows the ir spectra of galaxies with luminosities taken differing by various factors of 10 from @xmath19 = 10@xmath20 w hz@xmath1 , ranging from 10@xmath21 @xmath19 to 10@xmath22 @xmath19 .",
    "the luminosity correlations among the various ir wavebands are very tight for all kinds of non - seyfert spiral galaxies ( @xmath2 90% of spirals ) , including those classified as ",
    "normal \" ,  liner \" , and ",
    "ultraluminous \" . thus over more than four orders of magnitude of luminosity ,",
    "the infrared spectra of galaxies change gradually and continuously .",
    "the data do not support any clear quantitative distinction into separate categories of galaxies ( such as  starbursts \" or  hyperluminous \" or  dwarfs \" ) .",
    "for this reason , we can use a single luminosity function ( lf ) obtained from 60surveys to represent all ir emitting galaxies .",
    "( elliptical galaxies , being dust - poor , are not significant enough mid - ir and far - ir emitters to be included in our calculation ) .",
    "the total diffuse ir background at a given frequency is calculated by integrating over the luminosity function of galaxies and then integrating over redshift .",
    "( see , , the formalism in stecker & salamon ( 1996 ) for a derivation of diffuse background flux from unresolved point sources ) .",
    "we have used two different assumed galaxy luminosity functions , both of which are derived directly from iras source catalogs having complete spectroscopic redshift measurements .",
    "the first is the extended 12 micron galaxy sample ( rush , malkan & spinoglio 1993 ) , which is based on a 12flux - limited sample of 893 galaxies .",
    "the second is the sample of 2818 galaxies selected at 60by saunders 1990 ) .",
    "both differential luminosity functions are adequately fitted by a double - power - law function of the form : @xmath23^{-\\beta}\\ ] ] with low - luminosity slopes of @xmath24 and 1.7 for the respective 12and 60lf s , steepening by @xmath25 and 3.6 respectively , around a  knee \" at @xmath26w hz@xmath1 and @xmath27w hz@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the value given by saunders , ( 1990 ) for the normalization constant of the 60lf is @xmath28 mpc@xmath21dex@xmath1 .",
    "the value for the 12normalization constant , obtained from the data of rush , ( 1993 ) , is @xmath29 mpc@xmath21dex@xmath1 .",
    "the saunders , ( 1990 ) luminosity function is similar to that of the qdot survey ( lawrence , 1986 ) and the bgs ( soifer , 1987 ) . in particular all of these lf s agree extremely well on the volume density of galaxies within an order - of - magnitude of @xmath19 .",
    "we confirmed that our results are hardly changed ( by less than 10% at any frequency ) by substituting any of these 60lfs into our integration .",
    "in order to calculate the total contribution to the ir background from sources emitting at various redshifts , we must extrapolate the luminosity function data , obtained mainly for low - redshift galaxies , all the way to the redshift of initial galaxy formation , @xmath30 . at present , ir observations of galaxies at high redshifts are severely limited .",
    "although optical and ultraviolet searches tend to discover high - redshift galaxies with apparent visual absorptions of less than half a magnitude , near - infrared searches are capable of finding substantially dustier galaxies ( malkan , teplitz and mclean 1995 ; 1996 ) .",
    "a recent deep isocam 7image of the hubble deep field appears to have reliably detected 13 galaxies at @xmath31 ( rowan - robinson , 1997 ) . assuming these identifications are correct",
    ", they imply a very high rate of mid - infrared emission from luminous ir galaxies at z=1 .",
    "the redshift evolution of the infrared galaxy lf is only weakly constrained at present .",
    "saunders , ( 1990 ) found that their data could be fitted by a luminosity evolution with q = @xmath32 .",
    "a more recent analysis of a deep sub - sample of the iras faint source survey by bertin , dennefeld & moshir ( 1997 ) finds evidence for strong evolution of iras galaxies with @xmath33 out to a redshift of 0.3 .",
    "previous studies by soifer , ( 1987 ) , lonsdale , ( 1990 ) and pearson & rowan - robinson ( 1996 ) have come to similar conclusions regarding the redshift evolution of iras sources .",
    "the analysis of gregorich , ( 1995 ) , which indicated even stronger evolution , and which would lead to predictions of a higher ir background , appears to disagree with other analyses ; their sample may have been contaminated by false detections ( bertin , 1997 ) .",
    "lilly , ( 1996 ) found strong galaxy evolution at 280 nm , a wavelength which reflects instantaneous ( rather than cumulative ) star formation activity .",
    "their value for q was was in the range of 3 to 4 , depending on the cosmological model chosen .",
    "if , as is generally believed , short - wavelength emission from hot , young o and b stars is reradiated by dust in the far ir , a consistency with the iras and iso studies emerges .",
    "pei & fall ( 1995 ) analysed the evolution of neutral hydrogen gas in damped ly@xmath34 systems seen in quasar spectra .",
    "their study indicated that the star formation rate in the universe peaks at a redshift between 1 and 2 , evolving roughly as @xmath35 at lower redshifts and falling off at higher redshifts .",
    "such evolution is consistent with recent studies of the redshift distribution of galaxy emissivity and corresponding star formation history by lilly , ( 1996 ) , cowie , songaila , hu & cohen ( 1996 ) , madau , ( 1996 ) , and connelley , ( 1997 ) .",
    "we have therefore evolved the locally - determined galaxy lf to higher redshift assuming ( 1 ) pure luminosity evolution of the form @xmath36 for @xmath37 , ( 2 ) no evolution , _ i.e. _ , @xmath38 = const , for @xmath39 , and ( 3 ) no emission , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath40 , for @xmath41 .",
    "since it has been fairly well established that the stellar emissivity from galaxies peaks at a redshift between 1 and 2 ( see above ) , we assumed values for @xmath42 of 1 and 2 , @xmath30 = 4 , and q = 3 for our `` best upper and lower estimates '' .",
    "( we checked that pure density evolution @xmath43 , which has less physical plausibility , gave very similar results . )",
    "the upper two ( heavier ) solid curves in figure 2 show the result of our computation with q = 3 for values of @xmath42 of 1 and 2 and a @xmath30 of 4 .",
    "( the solid lines are based on the 60lf , while the dashed lines were obtained using the 12lf with only the @xmath44 case and the conservative lower limit shown . )",
    "the estimated ir background is on average @xmath220% higher using the 60lf .",
    "( note that , as given in the discussion following eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath45 is greater than @xmath46 ) .",
    "this might be attributed partly to some possible incompleteness in the 12 survey versus the 60surveys with better sensitivity .",
    "we also note that the 12lf refers only to non - seyfert galaxies , and therefore has a very steep high - luminosity cut - off .",
    "the 60lf , which does not separate out the seyferts , therefore includes some extremely red galaxies with peak luminosities around 60that were not included in the 12calculation .",
    "seyfert galaxies make up approximately 10% of the ir background at 12and even less at longer wavelengths where non - seyfert galaxies are relatively brighter .",
    "a crude indication of the relative contributions to the 12background from low - redshift seyferts can be inferred from the fact that 53 of the 893 ( 6% ) 12 micron galaxies are classified as type 1 , and 63 ( 7% ) are classified as type 2 .",
    "we have calculated their contribution to the diffuse background and determined that it is less than 10% , assuming the same evolution as non - seyferts .",
    "a very conservative lower limit on the ir background spectrum was derived by assuming the least amount of galaxy luminosity evolution consistent with the iras galaxy counts , _",
    "i.e. _ , q=2 and a maximum redshift @xmath47 .",
    "this is the smallest @xmath30 and evolution exponent which are allowed ( , rowan - robinson , 1997 ) .",
    "the conservative lower limit is shown by the lower light lines in figure 2 ( with the 60lf calculation as the solid line and the 12calculation as the dotted line ) .",
    "the amplitude of this lower limit flux is less than half of that calculated for the @xmath42 = 1 , @xmath30 = 4 estimate and less than one third of that calculated for the @xmath42 = 2 @xmath30 = 4 estimate .",
    "the predicted shape of the lower - limit background spectrum is similar to that of our @xmath42 = 1 estimate ; it differs from the @xmath42 = 2 case because the peak is shifted to slightly shorter wavelengths owing to the redshift cut - off . for similar reasons ,",
    "the 3bump from redshifted starlight is relatively weaker , since we have cut off emission beyond z = 1 .",
    "we can compare our best - estimate ir background spectra ( the darker solid lines in figure 2 ) with the presently existing data , and with previous calculations based on modelling .",
    "figure 2 shows the cobe - dirbe residuals given by hauser ( 1996 ) , upper limits determined from a fluctuation analysis of the cobe - dirbe maps by kashlinsky , ( 1996 ) , and the upper limit obtained from the lack of significant absorption in the spectrum of mrk 421 up to @xmath2 3 tev by stecker and de jager ( 1993 ) .",
    "our results are also consistent with upper limits obtained by dwek & slavin ( 1994 ) , also using tev data from mrk 421 . a power - law extrapolation of our results to wavelengths greater than 500would be consistent with upper limits obtained in that range from the firas data by fixsen , ( 1996 ) .",
    "our best - estimate background spectrum agrees quite well with the claimed detection levels at wavelengths greater than 150obtained by puget , ( 1996 ) ( not shown ) based on an analysis of firas data .",
    "there are several uncertainties which could affect our results :    \\(1 ) the redshift corresponding to the maximum star formation rate is , at present , not well defined .",
    "\\(2 ) uncertainties in the galaxy lf at low luminosities do not affect our result much because the integrated infrared luminosity is dominated by the contributions of galaxies within an order of magnitude of the luminosity knee at @xmath19 .",
    "\\(3 ) the contributions from galaxies at redshifts greater than those where the luminosity function is strongly evolving are substantially reduced by the cosmological factors involving geometry and energy redshifting . for this reason , our choice of the maximum redshift does not influence the results much .",
    "there is a more significant dependence on the redshift , @xmath42 , below which we assume @xmath48 luminosity evolution and beyond which we assume that no evolution occurred .",
    "our results are within 50% of previous results obtained by theoretical modeling ( see review by lonsdale 1996 ) .",
    "they are in general agreement in flux level with the most recent calculation of franceschini , ( 1997 ) . however , our spectrum , being based on empirical data , is somewhat different from many previous results which are based on theoretical modeling , _",
    "e.g. _ , franceschini .",
    "( 1997 ) and previous work ) .",
    "in particular , the `` valley '' between stellar emission at a few and dust emission at @xmath2 100is almost non - existent in our spectrum , because our empirical galaxy spectra automatically account for the very wide range of dust temperatures present .",
    "the extragalactic infrared background fluxes calculated in this paper have been used to make new calculations of the absorption of extragalactic high energy .",
    "the results of those calculations will be presented elsewhere ( stecker & de jager 1997b , c ) .",
