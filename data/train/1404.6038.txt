    "the galactic center ( gc ) has many outstanding structures that are not seen in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , several lines of evidence indicate that the magnetic field plays an important role in this region .",
    "a strong magnetic field of 50 @xmath7 g has been suggested as an averaged figure within the central 400 pc region by an analysis of the non - thermal radio spectrum @xcite , and many unique astrophysical structures related to the magnetic field have been discovered so far .",
    "many linear , non - thermal radio filaments are present in the radio arc @xcite , in which highly ordered magnetic field lines distributed vertically to the galactic plane are traced by their radio synchrotron emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their origin is still elusive , though numerous ideas have been advanced @xcite . on a larger scale , @xcite discovered two giant molecular loops @xmath2700 pc away from the center with a height of @xmath2200 pc , and they propose that they are a result of magnetic buoyancy driven by the parker instability .",
    "follow - up studies reveal that the footpoints of the loops have highly turbulent molecular clumps with velocity dispersions of @xmath250 km s@xmath1 , and magnetic reconnection has been discussed as the origin of these clumps @xcite .",
    "the double helix nebula ( hereafter dhn ) was discovered @xmath2100 pc above the galactic center by @xcite using infrared observations with spitzer ( figure [ dhn ] ) .",
    "it has an apparent helical morphology that can be seen in dust emission , implying that it is organized by a magnetic field . @xcite",
    "suggest that the dhn was created by torsional alfvn waves emitted from the circum - nuclear disk ( cnd ) which surrounds the supermassive black hole , sgr a*. on the other hand , @xcite use radio polarization measurements to hypothesize that the dhn is an extension of the polarized northern lobe of the magnetic radio arc .",
    "an interesting clue that supports the magnetic nature of the dhn is the presence of non - thermal radio emission distributed along the western rim of the dhn @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite present the observations of a @xmath8 area of the gc in the @xmath9co(@xmath6=21 ) transition obtained using the nanten2 4 m telescope with a beam size of 100@xmath10 , finding that two molecular features at radial velocities of @xmath1135 km s@xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath1 ( hereafter the @xmath1235 km s@xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath1 features ) coincide with the dhn .",
    "they also find that these features are located at the tops of molecular ridges elongated vertically to the galactic plane , having lengths of @xmath2150 pc at the gc distance . indeed",
    ", they estimate the distance of the ridges as 8@xmath132 kpc , which is consistent with the distance to the gc , by carrying out an analysis of the @xmath14-band stellar extinction .",
    "it therefore seems quite likely that the dhn and its molecular counterparts have their origin at the gc .",
    "however , a spatial resolution of 100@xmath10 , which corresponds to @xmath24 pc at the gc , is much coarser than the typical size of the helical filaments of the dhn , @xmath212 pc , and detailed comparisons of molecular emission with the 24 @xmath7 m spitzer image have not yet been possible .    in this study",
    ", we present results of new molecular observations toward the dhn using the cso and mopra telescopes .",
    "the improved spatial resolutions of @xmath233@xmath10 ( @xmath21.3 pc ) enable a more detailed description of the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath1 features and help clarify whether they are physically associated with the dhn .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; section 2 summarizes the observations and section 3 the results .",
    "the discussion is given in section 4 and a summary in section 5 .",
    "in this study , we adopt a gc distance of 8.0 kpc .",
    "observations of the @xmath9co(@xmath6=21 ) and @xmath15co(@xmath6=21 ) transitions were carried out with the 10.4 m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) in june 2011 .",
    "the half - power beamwidth ( hpbw ) of the telescope was 33@xmath10 at 230 ghz , which corresponds to 1.4 pc at the distance of the gc .",
    "the 230 ghz sis receiver provided a typical single - sideband ( ssb ) system temperature , @xmath16 , of @xmath2400500 k at 230 ghz and enabled us to observe the @xmath9co(@xmath6=21 ) and @xmath15co(@xmath6=21 ) transitions simultaneously .",
    "the spectrometer was a fast fourier transform spectrometer ( ffts ) with 8192 channels , providing a velocity coverage of @xmath21300 km s@xmath17 with a velocity resolution of 0.16 km s@xmath1 at 230 ghz .",
    "we observed the nine 4@xmath18 @xmath19 4@xmath18 regions shown in figure [ dhn ] with the on - the - fly ( otf ) mode .",
    "the output grid of the observations is spaced by 15@xmath10 .",
    "we smoothed the velocity resolution and spatial resolution to 0.79 km s@xmath1 and 45@xmath10 , respectively , to achieve a better noise level .",
    "the pointing accuracy was checked and adjusted every hour to be better than 5@xmath10 using observations of sio masers .",
    "the obtained spectra were converted into a @xmath20 scale with a beam efficiency of 0.698 . in the final maps",

    "noise fluctuations of @xmath20.08 k per channel .",
    "observations of the @xmath9co(@xmath6=10 ) and @xmath15co(@xmath6=10 ) transitions were carried out using the 22 m atnf mopra mm telescope in australia in october 2011 , which provided a hpbw of 33@xmath10 at 110 ghz , the same as that of the @xmath6=21 lines measured at the cso .",
    "the otf mode was again used toward the eight 4@xmath18 @xmath19 4@xmath18 regions shown in figure [ dhn ] .",
    "the typical ssb system noise temperature was 500 k. the mopra backend system `` mops '' provides 4096 channels across 137.5 mhz in each of the two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "the effective velocity resolution was 0.088 km s@xmath1 and the velocity coverage was 360 km s@xmath1 at 115 ghz .",
    "the pointing accuracy was checked every hour to be better than 7@xmath10 using observations of 86 ghz sio masers .",
    "the spectra were gridded to a 15@xmath10 spacing , and smoothed to a 45@xmath10 beam size .",
    "we observed orion - kl ( ra , dec.)=(@xmath21 , @xmath22 ) for the absolute intensity calibration and carried out comparisons with the results of @xcite . the `` extended beam efficiency '' in @xcite was estimated to be 0.38 by dividing the observed peak antenna temperature of orion - kl by 100 k , which is the corrected absolute intensity shown in figure 6 of @xcite .",
    "after calibrating the spectra , we finally smoothed the channels in velocity to a resolution of 0.86 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the typical r.m.s noise levels achieved in the @xmath9co(@xmath6=10 ) and @xmath15co(@xmath6=10 ) spectra are 0.14 k and 0.07 k , respectively .",
    "the reference position of the otf scans used in the cso and mopra observations is @xmath23 , which is chosen to have no significant emission over a velocity range of @xmath13100 km s@xmath1 at an r.m.s noise level of @xmath20.05 k per channel in both transitions .",
    "in figure [ lb ] we present the integrated intensity distributions of the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 feature and the 0 km s@xmath1 feature in @xmath9co(@xmath6=10 ) and @xmath15co(@xmath6=10 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 feature shown in figures [ lb](a ) and [ lb](b ) is distributed between @xmath24 and @xmath25 km s@xmath1 , widely covering the whole dhn .",
    "it extends to @xmath26 , beyond the top of the dhn where the 24 @xmath7 m emission becomes too faint to discern any possible continuation of the helical pattern .",
    "the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 co gas shows the strongest emission just to the west and north of the dhn and is spatially complementary to the western edge of the dhn , suggesting a possible association . in figures [ lb](c ) and [ lb](d ) , the 0 km s@xmath1 feature shows a remarkably good coincidence with the dhn .",
    "it has brighter co emission and traces the helical distribution of the dhn .",
    "the width of the 0 km s@xmath1 feature is @xmath24 pc , comparable to that of the dhn .",
    "the 0 km s@xmath1 feature is also extended to @xmath26 , where the infrared emission also fades out .",
    "the excellent spatial coincidence between the co and infrared emission provides robust evidence that the 0 km s@xmath1 feature is physically associated with the dhn , while association of the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 feature is less clear .    in appendix",
    "a , we show in figure [ lb2 - 1 ] the integrated intensity of the co(@xmath6=21 ) emission , and in figures [ channel_all1 ]  [ channel_0 ] , the velocity channel maps of @xmath9co(@xmath6=10 ) and @xmath9co(@xmath6=21 ) emission .",
    "another co feature around 8 to 15 km s@xmath1 ( hereafter the 10 km s@xmath1 feature ) overlaps the dhn , as seen in figure [ channel_all1 ] , but the gas distribution does not coincide with the dhn , thus it seems not to be associated .",
    "this feature is also seen in the large scale view of @xcite , and they conclude that a relationship with the dhn is unlikely",
    ".    figures [ peakv](a ) and [ peakv](b ) show the distributions of the first moment maps of the spectra in the @xmath1235 km s@xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath1 features , respectively . here",
    "@xmath9co(@xmath6=21 ) is used , which has less complicated profiles than @xmath9co(@xmath6=10 ) . in the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 feature , a velocity jump up to 2 km s@xmath1 which coincides spatially with the dhn",
    "is seen at @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ channel_m35 ] of appendix a , the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 feature consists of three filamentary structures that are distributed almost parallel to the dhn ; two of them occur around @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and the third one , which coincides with the dhn , is found near @xmath29 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the apparent velocity jump seen in figure [ peakv](a ) is due to the velocity difference between these filamentary structures . in figure [ peakv](b ) , around the top of the dhn ( @xmath30@xmath31 ) , the 0 km s@xmath1 feature shows an east - west velocity gradient of 1 km s@xmath1 pc@xmath1 . at the lower - latitude part of the 0 km s@xmath1 feature , the velocity distribution is much more complicated .",
    "we find a velocity jump of 2 km s@xmath1 around the intersection of the dhn strands at @xmath32 .",
    "to show the velocity distributions of the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath1 features in more detail , we define a new coordinate parallel to the dhn . a linear fit to the infrared emission of",
    "the dhn shows it to be tilted at a position angle of @xmath12116 relative to galactic north .",
    "we adopt the term `` dhn coordinate '' to refer to positions along this axis , with the origin taken to be @xmath33 .",

    "the top of the @xmath1235 km s@xmath1 feature shows a velocity width of @xmath25 km s@xmath1 , broader than the rest of the feature .",
    "figure [ lb+bv_0+m35](d ) shows a sinuous velocity variation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 along the y - axis , which results largely from the velocity jump found at @xmath32 in figure [ peakv](b ) .",

    "the 0 km s@xmath1 feature and the 10 km s@xmath1 feature are surrounded by diffuse molecular gas which is likely located in the foreground , and thus not necessarily associated with the dhn features .",

    "@xmath45 lies at the northern edge of `` the connecting feature '' identified by @xcite , which possibly links the @xmath0 feature and the 0 km s@xmath1 features .",
    "next we discuss the excitation condition of the molecular gas in the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath1 features .",
    "figure [ ratio_all ] shows the distributions of the @xmath9co @xmath6=21/@xmath6=10 velocity - integrated intensity ratios for the @xmath25 km s@xmath1 , 0 km s@xmath1 and 10 km s@xmath1 features .",
    "the individual velocity channel distributions of the line ratios for each of these features are presented in figures [ ratiochannel_m35 ]  [ ratiochannel_10 ] in appendix a. the @xmath0 , 0 , and 10 km s@xmath1 features all show typical ratios of @xmath20.8 and up to 1.1 , whereas the foreground emission which is seen at velocities between @xmath46 and @xmath47 km s@xmath1 in figure [ ratiochannel_0 ] shows lower ratios of less than 0.4 .",

    "the ratio 0.8 indicates excited condition of molecular gas with high temperature @xmath51  k and/or high density @xmath52 @xmath53 , while the ratio 0.4 indicates only low temperature ( @xmath54 k ) at low density 10@xmath55 @xmath53 .",
    "a high excitation condition of the molecular gas is one of the major characteristics of the cmz .",
    "the high observed co ratios therefore lend support to the placement of the candidate molecular counterparts of the dhn  the 0 and @xmath1235 km s@xmath1 features  near the gc , as also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the 10 km s@xmath1 feature in figure [ ratio_all](c ) also shows high excitation conditions and thus is perhaps located in the gc , although , as discussed above , the gas distribution of the 10 km s@xmath1 feature does not coincide spatially with the infrared emission of the dhn , suggesting that it is an independent , unrelated feature .",
    "we also note here that the less excited foreground emission can reduce the co intensities and thus can alter the intensity ratios in the dhn feature by absorption .",
    "we present model calculations of the absorption in appendix b using the lvg assumption , indicating that , although absorption can alter the ratios , ratios larger than 0.9 still indicate high excitation gas in the dhn .",
    "we here estimate the total molecular masses of the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 feature and the 0 km s@xmath1 feature .",
    "we adopt the x - factor  the conversion factor from the integrated intensity of @xmath9co(@xmath6=10 ) to h@xmath50 column density  of 0.7@xmath1910@xmath56 ( k km s@xmath1)@xmath1 @xmath57 @xcite , and derive the masses of the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and 0 km s@xmath1 features as @xmath5 m@xmath4 and @xmath3 m@xmath4 , respectively , consistent with previous estimates using nanten2 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the previous subsection , absorption by foreground gas can differentially reduce the co intensities .",
    "our model calculations shown in appendix b suggest that these total molecular masses can be underestimated by 3080 % .",

    "@xcite find that the @xmath0 and 0 km s@xmath1 features are continuations to higher latitude of molecular ridges that extend down to the galactic plane ; they also find that they are located in the gc .",
    "the ridge at 0 km s@xmath1 appears to be pointing toward the cnd rather than to the radio arc , although this does not provide an incontrovertible clue supporting the cnd hypothesis .",
    "the results presented here for the detailed distribution of molecular emission toward the dhn indicate that the both the @xmath0 and 0 km s@xmath1 features are associated with the dhn ; this was not conclusive in @xcite .",
    "these two molecular features can not be easily understood with either of the two present scenarios , so further investigations including theoretical studies are required .",
    "the warm the warm temperature of the molecular counterparts of the dhn is a characteristic that helps associate these features with the clouds of the central molecular zone .",
    "the energy injection rate required to keep the high temperature is estimated to be @xmath68 erg s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "here we assume a cylinder with a length of 30 pc for each feature to roughly estimate its volume , the diameters of which are estimated to be 10 pc and 5 pc for the @xmath0 km s@xmath1 feature and 0 km s@xmath1 feature , respectively , and we also assume a uniform density of 10@xmath69 @xmath53 and uniform temperature of the molecular gas , 30 k. it is reasonable to expect that the heating mechanism for the molecular gas is similar to that operating throughout the cmz since 30  k is within a range of the typical temperatures of molecular gas in the cmz , although the heating mechanisms in the cmz are still under active discussion .",
    "one possibility is heating by uv radiation from the large population of massive stars in the cmz .",
    "we estimate the total infrared luminosity toward the dhn ( @xmath70@xmath71 , @xmath72@xmath73 ) as @xmath74 l@xmath4 = @xmath75 erg s@xmath1 using the integrated fluxes of the four iras bands and the equation given in the table 1 of @xcite , 3.5 orders of magnitude larger than the cooling energy of the gas estimated above . in the 24 @xmath7 m image in figure [ dhn ] , the diffuse emission distributed around the dhn accounts for roughly about 50  % of the flux density of the dhn .",
    "thus , if we consider the contribution of the diffuse emission , the total infrared luminosity is still much larger than the cooling energy .",
    "stellar heating is therefore a possible explanation of the observed warm gas .",
    "cosmic - rays are also a possible heating source for the molecular gas in the dhn .",
    "the non - thermal radio emission which is used to probe the distribution of the cosmic - ray electrons shows a distribution extending to high latitude @xcite , including the northern part of the polarized lobe @xcite .",

    ", highly turbulent molecular gas with a strong magnetic field possesses plenty of energy , but the velocity widths of the molecular features in the dhn are only about a few km s@xmath1 , much smaller than the typical figures in the cmz , making it less likely as the origin of the warm molecular gas in the dhn .",
    "the present study is summarized as follows ;    1 .",
    "we have carried out new observations of @xmath9co(@xmath6=10 ) , @xmath15co(@xmath6=10 ) , @xmath9co(@xmath6=21 ) and @xmath15co(@xmath6=21 ) emission using the cso and mopra telescopes toward the dhn with angular resolutions of @xmath233@xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath21.3 pc at the distance of the gc , 8 kpc .",
