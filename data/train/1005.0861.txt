    "solid - state semiconductor lateral quantum dots are strong candidates for the physical realization of qubits . these artificial systems can be designed to allow for the observation of coherent oscillations between their quantum states . since its first proposals,@xcite",
    "a wide variety of experiments have demonstrated control over the spin degree of freedom of confined electrons in quantum dots,@xcite as well as charge states.@xcite solid - state quantum computer architectures with qubits encoded in dopant atoms in semiconductor crystals have also been proposed.@xcite quantum dots present the ubiquitous advantages of being manufactured from highly developed semiconductor technology and may offer easier scalability , the latter being key in enabling the manufacturing of large - scale quantum computers in the future .",
    "a drawback to their use in quantum computers is that they also couple rather effectively to external degrees of freedom which lead to decoherence .",
    "semiconductor qubits are susceptible to various decoherence mechanisms .",
    "hyperfine coupling to lattice nuclear spins reduces the phase coherence of electron spins,@xcite while qubits based on the charge degree of freedom are particularly sensitive to decoherence mechanisms related to charge motion , such as coupling to phonon modes and to charge traps in the substrate .",
    "several of these sources have been investigated.@xcite        in this paper we focus on charge - based qubits .",
    "the simplest realization of a charge qubit is a doubl - quantum - dot ( dqd ) system with an odd number of electrons , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "so far measurements of quality ( @xmath2 ) factors of coherent oscillations in these systems have yielded rather low values in the range of 39.@xcite in an effort to identify the main sources of decoherence , theoretical estimates of the @xmath2 factor have been carried out assuming mainly the coupling to acoustic phonons.@xcite however , a discrepancy of at least one order of magnitude remains between the experimental value and the theoretical estimates , with the latter predicting larger @xmath2 factors .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that the phonons may not be the dominant noise source in current experimental setups .",
    "thus , an investigation of other possible environmental decoherence mechanisms is in order . here , we consider the coupling of the dqd charge - based qubit systems to voltage fluctuations in the gates .",

    "[ sec : estimates ] we estimate the equivalent circuit parameters and in sec .  [ sec : rates ] we calculate upper bounds to the decoherence rates and @xmath2 factors .",
    "our main finding is that voltage fluctuations cause only a very small decoherence effect in dqd charge qubits . since double - dot _ spin _ qubits are also susceptible to decoherence due to charge motion , in sec .",

    "for the sake of maintaining some generality in our study , we will only treat electromagnetic fluctuations which can be expressed as eq . ( [ eq : hnoise ] ) . in addition , we will model the voltage fluctuations through frequency - dependent impedances along the gate transmission lines .",

    "decoherence due to the coupling between orbital ( charge ) and environmental degrees of freedom also occurs in certain spin - based quantum dot qubits . for instance , in the double - dot system introduced by the harvard group @xcite , the computational basis is formed by the singlet and the @xmath243 triplet states of a dqd system possessing an overall excess of two electrons .",
    "single qubit operations are performed by modulating the gate - voltage difference between the two dots , as well as through the coupling to an inhomogeneous overhauser field .",

    "gate voltage fluctuations will couple to this spin qubit similarly to the case of the dqd charge qubit.@xcite therefore , for small biases ( @xmath254 ) , we can study decoherence induced by electromagnetic fluctuations in the spin qubit employing the same analysis developed in the previous sections for the charge qubit .",
    "we note that several studies of decoherence due to other mechanisms also present in these qubits have been done.@xcite    the decoherence rates will depend strongly on the qubit operation point , given that the prefactor @xmath255 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hspin ] ) varies rapidly with @xmath22 .",
    "qubit operations around this point require pulsing the exchange coupling @xmath246 for a time interval @xmath256 , during which the qubit may be vulnerable to dephasing due to electromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "an estimate of the corresponding decoherence time can be obtained by using the curve @xmath246 plotted in fig .",

    "near @xmath257 mv , one finds @xmath258 .",
    "since decoherence rates are proportional to the square of the bath - qubit coupling , namely , @xmath259 in this case , we conclude that the decoherence times due to electromagnetic fluctuations are @xmath260 larger than those found for the dqd charge qubits , hence ranging from tens to hundreds of millisecond . in practice , these times are much larger than @xmath256 , which is typically a few hundreds of picosecond .",
    "we can conclude that gate - voltage fluctuations are also not a significant source of decoherence for spin qubits .",
    "in this paper , we have modeled noise introduced by gate - voltage fluctuations in double - quantum - dot systems .",
    "we attempted to model the circuits leading to the dqd in a way that put us as close to real experimental values as possible , while still being able to estimate all the relevant parameters and calculate decoherence rates and quality factors .",
    "we chose to place our noise sources in our gates because we believe they give the largest contribution to decoherence during qubit operations .",
    "for additional considerations , noise sources could also be placed , for example , in the drain and source electrodes .",
    "we have estimated the effect of fluctuations in the electrodes feeding the quantum dots and shown the influence that parameters such as temperature and inter - capacitive coupling between electrodes have on decoherence in qubit operation .",
    "we have also shown that , similarly to decoherence by phonon coupling , temperature degrades coherence in the state superpositions , reinforcing the need for efficient refrigeration of the leads .",
    "this effect can be explained analogously to the radiation of a black body , which increases with temperature .",
    "contrary to what was initially expected , it was found that a stronger inter - capacitive coupling between electrodes actually introduces stronger decoherence in the qubit system .",
    "thus , in order to mitigate this effect , it is important to keep the leads gating each quantum dot in the system as isolated as possible from each other .",
    "there are a few possible refinements to the model presented here .",
    "one such improvement includes adding the electrical resistance in the leads , which in practice requires the use of a lossy transmission line model for the effective circuit .",
    "it may also be important to take into account the drag effect on the leads due to the proximity to the 2deg .",
    "this effect will change the effective circuit parameters , thus influencing the calculation of relaxation and dephasing times .",
    "we have found that electromagnetic fluctuations in dqd systems do not introduce a dominating decoherence effect .",
    "the quality factors calculated for our system at room temperature ( @xmath261 ) are still well above the @xmath2 factors found in systems under the effect of phonon coupling ( @xmath262).@xcite if we compare these results with the experimental results ( @xmath263 ) for @xmath2 factors , the discrepancy is even larger.@xcite    the disagreement between theoretical estimates and measured decoherence times in charge based dqd system leads us to believe that there must be another possible noise source that accounts for the short decoherence times observed in these systems .",
    "for instance , it has been recently argued that electron - electron interactions can enhance the effect of fluctuating background charges on the charge qubits.@xcite    in order to identify the leading decoherence mechanism in charge - based qubits , it would be very helpful if the dependence of the @xmath2 factor on the qubit operating frequency @xmath201 were measured .",
    "for instance , for bosonic environments , this would yield the spectral function . with this information in hand",
    ", one could perhaps trace back the physical process underlying the decoherence mechanism . a candidate for such source",
    "is the presence of fluctuating background charges trapped in the insulating substrate or at the gaas / gaalas interface .",
