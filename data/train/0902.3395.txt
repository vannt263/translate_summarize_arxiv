    "this work can be viewed as a continuation of the project started by borodin and myself , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but it can be also read independently . the goal of the project is to study markovian stochastic dynamics in certain infinite - dimensional models that originate from random partitions .",
    "the main difference of this paper from the previous ones is in introducing a new parameter @xmath3 , the so - called jack parameter , which is analogous to the @xmath4-parameter ( inverse temperature ) in the log - gas systems ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "exact statements of our results can be found in the next subsection .",
    "meanwhile , we would like to explain some ideas behind this work and to describe our motivation .",
    "several classes of infinite - dimensional markov processes are known . a large part of the literature on those deals with interacting particle systems on a lattice , and also with similar systems in @xmath6 that are related to gibbs measures .",
    "statistical mechanics serves as the main motivational source for such models .",
    "another source of infinite - dimensional markov processes is population genetics .",
    "a very interesting but not very well studied problem is construction of dynamics for particle systems with nonlocal interaction of log - gas type ; such systems naturally arise as large @xmath7 limits of @xmath7-particle random matrix type ensembles .",
    "the model that we study in this paper is of a different origin  it came up in the asymptotic representation theory of symmetric groups .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out to be somewhat similar to log - gas systems on one hand , and on the other hand it is closely connected to one of the well - known models from population genetics @xcite .",
    "constructing markov dynamics on an infinite - dimensional state space often constitutes a nontrivial problem .",
    "for example , it may be difficult to assign rigorous meaning to an intuitive definition of the infinitesimal generator of the markov process .",
    "see , e.  g. , the paper by spohn @xcite , where the problem of the justification of the large @xmath7 limit transition for dyson s log - gas systems is discussed . in order to construct a markov generator ,",
    "one often uses dirichlet forms .",
    "this is a very effective yet technically demanding analytic method . in this paper",
    "we follow a more direct approach in which analysis is largely replaced by algebra and combinatorics .",
    "i hope that some ideas below may be useful for studying the dynamics in log - gas systems as well .",
    "let us now describe ( in very general terms ) the model considered below .",
    "denote by @xmath8 the set of partitions of the natural number @xmath9 .",
    "we identify partitions @xmath10 and young diagrams with @xmath9 boxes . for any @xmath11",
    "we introduce a probability distribution @xmath12 on @xmath8 that depends on three continuous parameters @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting ensemble of random partitions can be compared to @xmath7-particle random matrix ensembles ; the role of the parameter @xmath7 is played by @xmath9 .",
    "let me not give an exact expression for the weights @xmath14 here , as it requires a fairly long discussion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . instead , let me note that this expression can be represented in the form very much reminiscent of the joint probability density for random matrix @xmath4-ensembles : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the length of the partition @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a function on partitions that can be split into the sum of one - particle and two - particle `` interaction potentials '' , @xmath19 the two - particle potential on large distances is asymptotically equivalent to the logarithmic one : @xmath20 the analogy between random partitions and random matrices that looked startling 10 years ago ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , is nowadays viewed as commonplace @xcite .    the key property of the distributions @xmath12 is the fact that they are related to each other via a certain canonical chain of markovian transition functions @xmath21 ( @xmath11 ) , that depend only on @xmath3 , and that are defined in terms of the jack symmetric functions corresponding to the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "according to a general theorem proved in @xcite , this coherency property implies the existence of the limiting probability distribution @xmath22 which lives on the infinite - dimensional compact space is related to the fact that young diagrams are _ two - dimensional _ objects  they have rows and columns that play equal roles in our model . ]",
    "@xmath23 the space @xmath24 is called the _ thoma simplex _ , and the limit measures @xmath25 are called the ( boundary ) _ z - measures_.    the above - mentioned theorem from @xcite claims that there exists a one - to - one correspondence @xmath26 between the probability distributions @xmath27 on @xmath24 and the _ coherent families _",
    "@xmath28 , that is , sequences of probability distributions related by the markovian ( @xmath3-dependent ) transition functions @xmath21 mentioned above .",
    "in fact , this theorem contains more : it provides a possibility of constructing a _ canonical _ markov dynamics on @xmath24 that preserves the given distribution @xmath27 .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "there exists a simple and natural way of constructing , for any coherent family @xmath28 , a sequence of reversible markov chains @xmath29 with stationary distributions @xmath30 .",
    "we call those the _ up - down chains_. now it is natural to raise a question whether the up - down chains converge , as @xmath31 , to a markov process on @xmath24 that has @xmath27 as its stationary distribution . in the concrete case of z - measures",
    "@xmath27 we can answer this question in the affirmative .. ]    although the results of this paper are stated in probabilistic terms , the main content of the paper is algebraic , and it can be phrased as follows .",
    "consider the algebra @xmath32 of symmetric functions , and identify it with the algebra of polynomials in countably many generators @xmath33 ( the power sums ) .",
    "further , denote by @xmath34 the markov operator for the @xmath9th up - down chain .",
    "originally @xmath34 is defined as an operator in the space of functions on the finite set @xmath8 .",
    "however , we show that there exists a uniformly defined ( for all @xmath11 ) representation of the operators @xmath34 in terms of certain operators in the algebra @xmath32 ( essentially we carry the operators @xmath34 over to a common space ) . the most difficult part of the work is the computation of this representation in the form of a differential operator with respect to formal variables @xmath33 .",
    "the techniques that we apply here are discussed in subsection [ 1 - 5 ] below .    after bringing @xmath34 s to a suitable form",
    ", we find the pre - generator of the markov process on @xmath24 as the limit ( in a certain rigorous sense ) @xmath35 the factor @xmath36 corresponds to scaling time  one step of the markov chain with large number @xmath9 is equated to a small time interval of size @xmath37 .",
    "the justification of the limit transition is performed using standard techniques ( trotter - type theorems , see the book @xcite ) , as well as some ideas from the paper @xcite .",
    "this paper and its relation to the present work is further discussed in subsection [ 1 - 2 ] below .      in the remarkable paper @xcite published in 1981 ,",
    "ethier and kurtz studied a one - parameter family of diffusions on the space @xmath38 the space @xmath39 is compact in the topology of coordinatewise convergence and can be regarded as an infinite - dimensional simplex .",
    "we call it the _ kingman simplex_. the diffusions are determined by infinitesimal generators acting on an appropriate space of functions on @xmath39 and can be written as second order differential operators @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the parameter .. we use another symbol because of a conflict of notations .",
    "we have also omitted the factor of @xmath42 in the formula of @xcite .",
    "] each of the diffusions has a unique stationary distribution and is reversible and ergodic .",
    "this is a nice example of infinite - dimensional markov processes , especially interesting because the stationary distributions are the famous poisson - dirichlet distributions ( about them , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the 3-parameter family of markov processes on the thoma simplex @xmath24 , constructed in the present paper , is a wider model of infinite - dimensional diffusions , containing ethier ",
    "kurtz s diffusions as a limit case . in our model , in contrast to that of ethier  kurtz , the infinitesimal generator can not be written as a differential operator in natural coordinates @xmath43 on the state space @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless , the restriction of the generator on an appropriate invariant core @xmath44 admits an explicit expression .",
    "specifically , the core @xmath44 is the algebra of polynomials @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 are the following functions on @xmath24 @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the jack parameter mentioned above . and @xmath49 , cf . @xcite . about the link between supersymmetry and young diagrams ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "these functions are continuous and algebraically independent .",
    "we call them the _ moment coordinates _ for the following reason : let us embed @xmath24 into the space of probability measures on the closed interval @xmath50\\subset{\\mathbb r}$ ] by assigning to an arbitrary point @xmath51 the atomic measure @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the dirac measure at @xmath54",
    ". then @xmath55 is equal to the @xmath56th moment of the measure @xmath57 .",
    "even though the moment coordinates are not true coordinates on @xmath24 in the conventional differential - geometric sense , they allow us to define the markov pre - generator as a second order differential operator acting in the polynomial algebra @xmath44 and depending on the jack parameter @xmath3 and two additional continuous parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 : @xmath60\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}q_i}\\\\ + { \\theta}\\sum_{i , j\\ge0}(i+j+3)q_i q_j\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}q_{i+j+2}}\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",

    "\\(i ) the operator is closable in @xmath62 and its closure serves as the infinitesimal generator of a diffusion process on @xmath24 .",
    "\\(ii ) the process has a unique stationary distribution and is reversible and ergodic .",
    "\\(iii ) the closure of the pre - generator in the @xmath0 space with respect to the stationary distribution is a self - adjoint operator with purely discrete spectrum @xmath64 where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath65 equals the number of partitions of @xmath66 without parts equal to @xmath1 .",
    "\\(iv ) the stationary distribution is the z - measure @xmath25 .    about the z - measures see the next subsection .",
    "the restrictions on parameters @xmath67 are indicated below in proposition [ 5.3 ] .    in the limit regime as @xmath68",
    "our model degenerates to the ethier  kurtz model with parameter @xmath69 .",
    "let me explain this informally :    observe that as @xmath70 , the interval @xmath50 $ ] shrinks to @xmath71 $ ] so that the @xmath4-coordinates disappear from .",
    "this explains why the thoma simplex @xmath24 degenerates to the kingman simplex .",

    "note also that in the regime , the z - measures weakly converge to the poisson - dirichlet distribution with parameter @xmath69 .",
    "the z - measures form a distinguished family of probability measures on the thoma simplex @xmath24 .",
    "theses measures first emerged in the note @xcite in connection with the problem of harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group , see also @xcite for a detailed exposition and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all these papers concerned the special case @xmath74 .",
    "then the z - measures are the spectral measures governing the decomposition of some analogs of the regular representation ; here it is worth noting that @xmath24 is a kind of dual space to the infinite symmetric group . the case @xmath75 is also related to a problem of harmonic analysis ( see @xcite ) , while ( as was already mentioned above ) the limit case @xmath76 corresponds to the poisson - dirichlet distributions . for general @xmath48 ,",
    "the z - measures were defined in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a different approach ) .",

    ", @xmath14 is a rational function in @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath3 , whose explicit expression can be found in @xcite .    for any fixed @xmath48 ,",
    "the set of admissible values of @xmath67 ( for which the z - measure is well defined as a probability measure on @xmath24 ) is precisely the set of those @xmath67 for which the quantities @xmath14 are nonnegative for all diagrams @xmath17 ( about the meaning of this condition , see the next subsection ) . since @xmath14 does not change under transposition @xmath95",
    ", one can equally well take as parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 ; in these new coordinates , the set of admissible values becomes a closed subset of @xmath98 with a nonempty interior .",
    "this set can be divided into two parts depending on whether the integrals are strictly positive for all @xmath17 ( the nondegenerate series ) or vanish for some @xmath17 ( the degenerate series ) . for more detail , see @xcite .",
    "the present paper focuses on the nondegenerate series but i would like to give some comments on the degenerate series , because the degenerate z - measures demonstrate in miniature some features of the general z - measures .",
    "the characteristic property of the degenerate series is that the corresponding z - measure @xmath25 is supported by a finite - dimensional subset in @xmath24 .",
    "the simplest example is @xmath99 then the support of the z - measure is the subset @xmath100 which is a simplex of dimension @xmath101 ; the measure itself has the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 stands for the lebesgue measure on the simplex .",
    "it is worth noting that in this special case , the integrals turn into selberg - type integrals , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more refined examples of degenerate z - measures involve both the @xmath81 and @xmath4 coordinates and provide super - analogs of the selberg integral ( see @xcite ) . in a certain sense",
    ", the general z - measures on @xmath24 can be viewed as an infinite - dimensional ( super ) generalization of the selberg measures .",
    "closely related to is the following probability measure on the cone @xmath104 in @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the lebesgue measure on the cone .",
    "note that determines the @xmath7-particle _ laguerre ensemble _ with the beta parameter @xmath77 .",
    "this example builds a bridge between the z - measures and random matrix type ensembles and illustrates the thesis that the jack parameter @xmath3 plays the role of the beta parameter of random matrix theory .",
    "as was already mentioned above , the diffusion processes of theorem [ 1.1 ] arise as limits of some finite markov chains .",
    "here is an outline of the construction .",
    "recall that by @xmath8 we denote the set of young diagrams with @xmath9 boxes , @xmath108 .",
    "let us return to integrals and write them in abstract form @xmath109\\,\\int_{\\omega}\\mathcal p^\\circ_{{\\lambda};{\\theta}}({\\alpha};{\\beta})m(d{\\alpha}\\,d{\\beta } ) , \\quad { \\lambda}\\in{\\mathbb y}_n\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is an arbitrary probability measure on @xmath24 .",
    "one can prove that the functions @xmath89 are nonnegative on @xmath24 , which implies that the numbers @xmath110 are nonnegative , too .",
    "furthermore , for any fixed @xmath9 , one has @xmath111 so that @xmath112 is a probability measure on the finite set @xmath8 .",
    "next , one can prove that there exist embeddings @xmath113 such that the push - forwards @xmath114 converge to @xmath27 in the weak topology .",
    "it is worth noting that the embeddings do not depend on the initial measure @xmath27 .",
    "thus , for each fixed @xmath48 , there exists an approximation of the compact space @xmath24 by finite sets @xmath8 providing an approximation of any probability measure @xmath27 on @xmath24 by some canonical sequence @xmath28 of probability measures on the sets @xmath8 .",
    "this fact is a refinement of thoma s theorem @xcite , essentially due to vershik and kerov @xcite . for general @xmath48",
    "this is the result of @xcite .",
    "a similar fact holds in the limit case @xmath76 , with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath39 : this is kingman s theorem , see @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "the sequences @xmath28 coming from probability measures on @xmath24 can be characterized by a system of relations , @xmath115 where @xmath9 and @xmath116 are arbitrary and @xmath117[p_1 \\mathcal p_{\\mu;{\\theta}}:\\mathcal p_{{\\lambda};{\\theta}}]}{[p_1^n:\\mathcal p_{{\\lambda};{\\theta}}]}.\\ ] ]    thus , establishes a bijective correspondence between probability measures @xmath27 on @xmath24 and sequences @xmath28 of probability measures on the sets @xmath8 , satisfying the relations .",
    "such sequences are called _ coherent systems_. ,",
    "coherent systems were earlier introduced by kingman under the name of _ partition structures _ , see @xcite . ]",
    "the quantities are nonnegative and , for fixed @xmath10 , @xmath118 so that they determine transition kernels from @xmath8 to @xmath119 , for each @xmath9 .",
    "we call them the _ down transition probabilities _ ( these are the markovian transition functions mentioned above in subsection [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the relations mean that the down transition kernels transform @xmath30 to @xmath120 , for each @xmath9 .",
    "now assume that @xmath27 is nondegenerate in the sense that for the corresponding coherent system @xmath28 , all quantities @xmath110 are strictly positive .",
    "this condition is fulfilled , for instance , if the topological support of @xmath27 is the whole space @xmath24 .",
    "then one can define some _ up transition probabilities _",
    "@xmath121 which determine transition kernels in the reverse direction , from @xmath8 to @xmath122 , and transform @xmath30 to @xmath123 , for each @xmath9 .",
    "let us emphasize that the up transition probabilities depend not only on @xmath3 ( as the down probabilities ) but also of the coherent system , that is , of the initial measure @xmath27 .",
    "taking the superposition of these two transition kernels we get , for each @xmath9 , a transition kernel from @xmath8 to itself , @xmath124 it determines a reversible ergodic markov chain on @xmath8 which has @xmath30 as the stationary distribution .",
    "we call this chain the @xmath9th _ up - down markov chain _ associated with @xmath27 .",
    "thus , given @xmath27 , we dispose not only of a canonical approximation @xmath125 but also of a natural reversible markov chain preserving the @xmath9th measure , for each @xmath9 .",
    "this fact forms the basis of the work : the idea is to analyze the asymptotics of the up - down chains associated with a nondegenerate z - measure , as @xmath31 , and show that the chains have a scaling limit leading to a markov process on @xmath24 .",
    "this idea was first realized for the special case @xmath74 in the paper @xcite by borodin and myself .",
    "however , our computation of the limit pre - generator in the moment coordinates relied on a combinatorial result of lascoux and thibon @xcite for which no jack analog is available . in the present paper",
    "i apply another method ; its basic ideas and related concepts are described in the next subsection .",
    "let @xmath126 be the space of functions on the finite set @xmath8 and @xmath127 be the one - step operator of the @xmath9th up - down markov chain , induced by the transition kernel : @xmath128 we show that @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the differential operator .",
    "although the pre - limit operators live in varying spaces , one can give a sense to the limit transition by making use of the projections @xmath131 , which are induced by the embeddings @xmath113 mentioned above .",
    "here we employ a well - known formalism , described in @xcite .",
    "then , using a refined version of trotter s theorem ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.5 ) ) , we show that @xmath130 is closable and generates a markov semigroup in @xmath62 .",
    "the remaining claims of theorem [ 1.1 ] are established in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "the heart of the paper is the proof of . to handle",
    "the transition probabilities entering formula we use an ingenious trick invented by kerov @xcite : kerov s idea was to consider _ anisotropic young diagrams _ made of rectangular boxes of size @xmath132 and to parametrize such diagrams by pairs of interlacing sequences , which encode the positions of the outer and inner corners ( for more detail , see section [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this trick allows one to completely avoid the hard machinery related to jack symmetric functions and reduce the proof of to a computation in the algebra of _ @xmath3-regular functions _ on the set @xmath80 of young diagrams .",
    "this algebra , denoted as @xmath133 , consists of _ @xmath3-shifted symmetric functions _ in coordinates @xmath134 . according to the original definition of the algebra @xmath133 ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "it is generated by the `` @xmath3-shifted '' analogs of power sums @xmath135 , \\qquad m=1,2,\\dots , \\quad { \\lambda}\\in{\\mathbb y}.\\ ] ] on the other hand , an important fact is that @xmath133 also admits a nice description in terms of kerov s interlacing coordinates .    note also that the computation of the limit operator in substantially employs an asymptotic formula for @xmath3-regular functions , established in @xcite ( see theorem [ 9.5 ] below ) .",
    "schur s q - functions span a proper subalgebra in the algebra of symmetric functions .",
    "as well known , these functions play the same role in the theory of projective characters of symmetric groups as the ordinary schur functions do for ordinary characters .",
    "an analog of z - measures related to schur s q - functions was found in @xcite , see also @xcite . replacing the ordinary young diagrams by the so - called shifted young diagrams ( which correspond to strict partitions ) ,",
    "one can define again the up - down markov chains .",
    "their scaling limits were studied by petrov @xcite .",

    "the long section [ 7 ] contains the key computation .",

    "<S> the family depends on three continuous parameters , one of which , the jack parameter , is similar to the beta parameter in random matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> the processes arise in a scaling limit transition from certain finite markov chains , the so called up - down chains on the young graph with the jack edge multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> each of the limit markov processes is ergodic and its stationary distribution is a symmetrizing measure . </S>",
    "<S> the infinitesimal generators of the processes are explicitly computed ; viewed as selfadjoint operators in the @xmath0 spaces over the symmetrizing measures , the generators have purely discrete spectrum which is explicitly described .    </S>",
    "<S> for the special value @xmath1 of the jack parameter , the limit markov processes coincide with those of the recent work by borodin and the author ( prob . </S>",
    "<S> theory rel . </S>",
    "<S> fields 144 ( 2009 ) , 281318 ) . in the limit </S>",
    "<S> as the jack parameter goes to @xmath2 , our family of processes degenerates to the one - parameter family of diffusions on the kingman simplex studied long ago by ethier and kurtz in connection with some models of population genetics .    </S>",
    "<S> the techniques of the paper are essentially algebraic . </S>",
    "<S> the main computations are performed in the algebra of shifted symmetric functions with the jack parameter and rely on the concept of anisotropic young diagrams due to kerov .    </S>",
