    "within the field of data analysis , there are several difficult problems that need to be addressed in order to extract information from the data that will be taken by advanced detectors .",
    "these include determining when a signal occurred , where this signal came from , and what the properties of the signal s source are . in this paper , we summarize how has been used to ease the computational burden of answering these questions .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows : sect .",
    "[ sect - svd ] gives a brief overview of , sect .",
    "[ sect - waveforms ] describes how can be used to approximate different classes of waveforms , sect .",
    "[ sect - compdetstat ] illustrates how has be used to construct composite detection statistics , sect .",

    "decomposes an arbitrary matrix @xmath0 into three components : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a unitary matrix of basis vectors such that the columns of @xmath3 are the right eigenvectors of @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a unitary matrix of reconstruction coefficients such that the columns of @xmath5 are the left eigenvectors of @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a diagonal matrix of singular values whose non - zero components are the square root of the eigenvalues associated with @xmath4 or @xmath8 .",
    "denotes the complex conjugate - transpose of matrix @xmath9 . ]",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath2 and @xmath5 are ordered such that the entries of @xmath7 are in descending order .",
    "we will see in the following sections that the properties of @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 have been used in different contexts .",
    "signal waveforms can be classified into two groups : those that are well modelled , and those that are not .",
    "collections of waveforms of both types can be called _ waveform catalogs _ , however here we restrict use of that term for non - well - modelled waveforms . we will refer to waveforms that are well modelled as _ template banks_. further discussion of temaplte banks and waveform catalogs can be found in sect .",
    "[ subsect - banks ] and [ subsect - catalogs ] , respectively .",
    "an example of a type of waveform that can be used to construct a template bank is a signal from the inspiral of a .",
    "these waveforms are well described theoretically by the approximation .",
    "this has allowed the construction of a metric on the signal parameter space that characterizes the distance between two points on parameter space based on the mismatch between the two waveforms.@xcite using this metric , a template bank can be constructed with these waveforms such that any point within a chosen region of parameter space will be no more than a specified distance from the nearest template , commonly chosen such that maximum mismatch between any template in the bank and any signal in the region of interest is @xmath10 .    in order to meet this requirement with the fewest number of templates , for a two dimensional parameter space with a constant metric",
    ", adjacent templates will have a mismatch of 9% , which means they have an overlap of 91% .",
    "investigated how the could compress a matrix @xmath0 whose rows are composed of the highly overlapping waveform time - series from such a template bank.@xcite they derived the expected fractional loss @xmath11 of approximating the waveforms in the template bank by the truncation of the of @xmath0 to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14th entry of @xmath7 , @xmath15 is the number of rows of @xmath0 or twice the number of templates in the template bank , and @xmath16 is where the is truncated . in addition",
    ", the maximum phase - averaged fractional loss can be bounded by @xmath17 which can be derived from the unitarity of the reconstruction coefficients .",
    "this approach to waveform compression has been implemented within a low - latency search for inspiral waveforms as one of the techniques to reduce the computational cost of data processing.@xcite similar techniques have also been applied to other types of signals using gram - schmidt orthogonalization.@xcite      waveform catalogs are necessary for waveforms that are not well modelled theoretically .",
    "such waveforms can arise from numerical simulations that are either too computationally expensive to study the parameter space thoroughly ( _ e.g. _ , numerical simulations of merging spinning binary black holes ) , or from numerical simulations that include matter ( _ e.g. _ , numerical simulations of or coalescing binary neutron stars ) .",
    "first proposed decomposing waveform catalogs of waveforms using gram - schmidt orthogonalization .",
    "ref .   expanded on this approach using the and comparing it to gram - schmidt orthogonalization .",
    "both approaches were found to perform similarly , being able to extract and prioritize waveform characteristics from the waveform catalogs .",
    "however , in the only a single decomposition of the catalog was needed , and additional information was obtained .",
    "namely , features that were present in many waveforms produced basis vectors with large singular values , whereas features present in only a few produce basis vectors with small singular values .",
    "constructing detection statistics when searching for signals is different depending on what type of search you are doing .",
    "searches can be classified into two groups , those searching for known signal waveforms and those searching for unknown signal waveforms .",
    "the standard approach to search for any known signal within data from a collection of waveforms is to matched filter the data , producing a time - series of , with each of the template waveforms .",
    "signals are then identified by identifying which templates at certain times produce large values of .@xcite    if one is only interested in answering the time component of the question , a _ composite detection statistic _ can be used , which tells whether the data looks like anything from a collection of template waveforms.@xcite cannon _ et al .",
    "_  showed how the can be used to construct such a composite detection statistic @xmath18 associated with a region of parameter space covered by a template bank of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the expected signal amplitude squared and @xmath21 is the associated with the @xmath22th basis vector.@xcite this statistic was derived using the orthonormality of the reconstruction coefficients and the basis vectors , as well as the ordered significance given by the singular values .",
    "it shows promise in reducing the computational cost of searching data for signals of known waveforms .",
    "when searching for a signal of unknown waveform , the search can be performed by looking at other aspects of how the signal interacts with the detectors . in particular , when there is a network of detectors in operation , the data from these detectors can be combined in such a way to produce coherent data streams that are direction dependent.@xcite    wen outlined how the detector responses associated with a given direction can be coherently combined and condensed using the .@xcite the of the network detector responses @xmath23 provides the basis vectors @xmath2 , singular values @xmath7 , and reconstruction coefficients @xmath5 . the data from the different detectors @xmath24 can be recombined into new data streams @xmath25 using the reconstruction coefficients @xmath26 the detection statistics for an unmodelled search could then be constructed using @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a chosen weight associated with different basis vectors , and the sum can be over different combinations of the new data streams .",
    "different choices for each of these parameters results in different optimizations of the detection statistic .",
    "producing the waveforms in the first place can be a computational challenge , which is the case for binary black hole coalescence waveforms produced by numerical relativity . to help solve this problem ,",
    "there have been several efforts to parameterize these waveforms , allowing waveforms from arbitrary points in parameter space to be produced .",
    "these efforts are based on models of the waveforms that need to be tuned .",
    "et al . _ have pursued a different approach by showing that the basis vectors from the of waveforms from a template bank approximately enclose the space of waveforms from that region of parameter space.@xcite further , they have also laid out a procedure that could be used to interpolate waveforms to high accuracy from arbitrary points in parameter space using the components of the .@xcite this is done by interpolating the reconstruction coefficients .",
    "once the interpolated reconstruction coefficients @xmath29 are in hand , the interpolated waveforms can be generated using @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a matrix containing interpolated waveforms at the locations where @xmath29 was interpolated . with a sufficient density of numerical relativity waveforms ,",
    "highly accurate interpolated waveforms could be produced for arbitrary points in parameter space .",
    "once it is known that there exists a signal in a data set , the next question that comes up is what are the parameters of the source of the signal .",
    "several sets of authors have used the toward this goal in different contexts .",
    "wen identified how the could be used to construct _",
    "null data streams _ and _ semi - null data streams_.@xcite null data streams are linear combinations of data from a network of detectors that will contain no signals,@xcite which are associated with zero - valued singular values from the of the response of a network of detectors .",
    "similarly , semi - null data streams are associated with small - valued singular values from the of the response of a network of detectors .",
    "_ showed how analyzing these semi - null data streams could improve the accuracy with which one could locate the source of a signal on the sky.@xcite    wen also explained how the could be used to extract a signal waveform from the data of a network of detectors.@xcite this was done by truncating the of the detector response matrix in order to regularize it .",
    "the extracted waveform @xmath32 is then the data from all detectors @xmath24 combined using the inverse of the regularized detectors response matrix , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the detectors response matrix regularized by truncating the after the @xmath16th singular value .",
    "rver _ et al .",
    "_ applied the of waveform catalogs to the parameter estimation problem.@xcite using the basis vectors associated with the of a waveform catalog , a parameter estimation search based on methods extracted the amplitudes of the signal associated with each of the basis vectors . by associating the extracted amplitudes with those of the waveforms in the catalog , physical parameters of the simulated signal could be estimated .",
    "extending the previously mentioned work , logue _",
    "_ applied the to multiple waveform catalogs , each associated with different production mechanisms or different types of stellar cores.@xcite by computing the bayes odd ratios associated with these different models by nested sampling techniques , the correct model for the can be determined .",
    "finally , cannon _ et al .",
    "_ discussed how the likelihood function , which is the quantity computed for parameter estimation , could be interpolated to decrease the computation cost of parameter estimation searches.@xcite using the interpolated reconstruction coefficients , the interpolated likelihood function would be given by @xmath35 where the locations the likelihood function is estimated are given by the locations where the reconstruction coefficients are interpolated .",
