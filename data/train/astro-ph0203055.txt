    "globular clusters contain some of the oldest stars in the universe and have long been vital clues to the earliest phases of the star formation in galaxies @xcite . in our own galaxy",
    "the known globular clusters are very old @xcite but there is evidence that they can form at lower redshift in suitably extreme conditions , generally associated with merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "the great age and low metallicity of globular cluster systems indicates that they should be present at very high redshifts and predate the bulk of their eventual host galaxies stars .",
    "the exciting prospect is that direct studies of globular cluster formation and evolution will soon become possible .",
    "the next generation of optical - infrared telescopes on the ground and in space will have the capability to detect objects at the nano - jansky level .",
    "an estimate of the faint number counts in the optical was undertaken for hst @xcite but we concentrate on the ir where the redshifts and rise in numbers is much more dramatic . in the 2 to 5 micron bands ,",
    "the combination of large k - corrections and substantial stellar brightening raises the fluxes from high redshift clusters into the range of 29 - 32 ab mag .",
    "these nanojansky flux levels are within the capabilities expected of future telescopes .    today s globular globular clusters are likely the survivors of a larger population present at the various times of formation @xcite . if their co - moving density increases by an order of magnitude over those at low redshift then the globular clusters are likely to appear with numbers at a given flux level that are comparable to sub - galactic mass dark matter halos which are the sites of the `` first stars '' @xcite .",
    "this paper calculates the magnitude limited distribution of the expected numbers , @xmath2 , the redshift distribution , @xmath3 , and estimates the angular clustering properties of the globular cluster population relative to their host galaxies .",
    "the predictions are made for filter pass bands sufficiently red that lyman @xmath4 trough absorption will not normally be an issue . in the next section",
    "we describe the calculation of the co - moving number density of globular clusters ( gc ) as a function of redshift for different evolutionary assumptions . in section 3",
    "we present the results of the number calculations .",
    "section 4 considers the apparent sky clustering of the distant gc .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the opportunities and complications that this population presents .",
    "the calculations are presented in a cosmology for which @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the expected sky density of gcs at magnitude @xmath8 and redshift @xmath9 depends on the product of the cosmological volume element and their luminosity function , @xmath10 , integrated with the volume element along the line of sight .",
    "the luminosity function has three sources of evolution .",
    "first , it is generally accepted that galactic tidal fields and stellar dynamical `` shocks '' erode a more numerous high redshift gc population into the remnant population we see today .",
    "we use the results of a relatively secure theoretical analysis of the evolution of the population , but also show results for a non - evolving distribution .",
    "second , as the stellar population becomes younger with increasing redshift its spectral energy distribution changes .",
    "third , the gcs form at some high , but as yet poorly determined , redshift . our approach to each of these evolutionary terms along with the normalization to the present day globular cluster population is discussed in the following section .",
    "recently fall & zhang ( 2001 , hereafter referred to as fz ) have discussed a generalized dynamical model for the evolution of the mass distribution of gcs .",
    "they find that within 1 - 2 gyr of origin , a wide range of initial gc mass distribution assumes a characteristic form which then evolves in a nearly self - similar way . at small mass , all clusters ( in the same tidal field )",
    "go to zero mass at the same rate due to two - body relaxation driven evaporation . at high mass , gravitational shocks impose a characteristic maximum mass above which there is a rapid cutoff of numbers .",
    "the continual depletion of gcs implies that over a hubble time about 10% of the initial cluster population survives , under the assumptions that the system is not replenished and that the galactic potential does not change .",
    "fz have kindly made their results for the evolution of the globular cluster mass distribution available for use in this paper .",
    "specifically we use the differential number of gcs at mass @xmath11 at time @xmath12 , @xmath13 , which fz present in their figure 3 .",
    "it should be noted that the fz model _ predicts _ the mass of the peak . to test this aspect of the models",
    "fz have put the milky way globular clusters on a mass scale using @xmath14 , as is appropriate for an old , metal poor stellar population .",
    "the agreement between model and observation is impressively good .",
    "the extensive testing of fz shows that the results should not change much with galaxy mass or galaxy type .",
    "the fz model results are specified at times of 0.01 , 1.5 , 3 , 6 and 12 gyr .",
    "we use a double spline function in the variable @xmath11 and @xmath15 to interpolate to other times .",
    "we extrapolate slightly beyond their 12 gyr model to the age of 13.4 gyr age of our cosmology .",
    "the minimum age of their models is a 0.01 gyr , where the `` formation distribution '' is close to a power law in mass",
    ". we will show the sensitivity of our results to the gc number evolution .",
    "we require the redshift dependent globular cluster luminosity function , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the observed luminosity in some filter band centered around @xmath18 .",
    "the conversion from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is made using a spectral synthesis model which gives the entire spectral energy distribution , @xmath21 , as a function of model age for given metallicity and star formation history .",
    "we use the pegase.2 code @xcite to calculate @xmath22 , the observed frame luminosity per unit mass in the filter band @xmath18 ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24/(1+z)$ ] is the model s mass normalized absolute flux in the observed frame and @xmath25 is the filter transmission function . noting that the photon redshift and the time dilation are included in eq .",
    "[ eq : ml ] , an object of mass @xmath11 gives an observed flux in the @xmath18 filter of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the co - moving distance in the adopted cosmology .",
    "the observed flux is converted to magnitudes using the definition @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is 31.4 ab magnitudes at 1 nano - jansky .",
    "the luminosity functions of the gc systems of the milky way and more than 50 nearby galaxies have been studied @xcite .",
    "a single galaxy s gc luminosity function is conventionally described as a gaussian ( in absolute magnitude , hence a lognormal distribution in luminosity ) centered at @xmath30 mag with a dispersion of about 1.2 magnitudes .",
    "although a more complex function , the fz mass model appears to describe the data at least as well as a gaussian .",
    "moreover , it is based on a dynamical theory that allows its history to be predicted . to use the fz function in our calculation we need to fix the volume normalization and we will also introduce a small shift in the @xmath31 value",
    ".      the mass normalization of the fz models is determined by the dynamics of the gcs within the model galaxy .",
    "although fairly insensitive to variations in the potential , the mass function does shift slightly depending on the specific galactic potential . here",
    "we need the luminosity function typical of a mix of galaxies .",
    "we adopt the functional form of the fz mass function and could adopt their @xmath14 value , however we prefer to make a small adjustment to provide an alternate match to the observational data .",
    "the fz mass function is a power law on the low mass side and much steeper than a gaussian on the high mass side .",
    "here we chose an @xmath32 value that brings the mean luminosities of the fz distribution to the mean of the gaussian fits .",
    "a numerical integration finds that @xmath33 mag should be identified as @xmath34 , which implies an @xmath35 .",
    "this small @xmath31 change is well within the uncertainty of stellar population modeling . in particular",
    ", @xmath32 is @xmath36 for the @xmath37 solar pegase models we compute at an age of 13.4 gyr .",
    "our normalization effectively raises the @xmath31 values of the pegase models by a multiplicative factor of 1.57 .",
    "the v band luminosity is widely used to describe low redshift clusters .",
    "however , it is beneficial for the accuracy of our application to high redshift galaxies main application to use k band luminosities .",
    "furthermore , the gc population is most closely connected to the old stellar population which is most accurately measured at low redshift by k band luminosities .",
    "the conversion from v to k must use the ir colors of a population with a metal abundance of about one - tenth solar , @xmath38 mag @xcite .",
    "the @xmath39 pegase models find @xmath40 mag at 13.4 gyr which is in essentially exact agreement with the observational relation .",
    "using this color we find that the mean peak k band luminosity for gcs is @xmath41 .",
    "this value is converted to the flux based ab magnitude system with the addition of @xmath42 mag .",
    "the mean co - moving density of gcs for a single galaxy is modeled as being directly proportional to its luminosity , @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the galaxy s absolute magnitude in the v band and @xmath45 is the total number in a gaussian luminosity function .",
    "the @xmath46 relation has significant variations with hubble type and possibly environment but appears to be accurate in the mean @xcite .",
    "since gc are most clearly associated with old stellar light it is natural to use a k band luminosity function , in which case , @xmath47 where a galaxy with solar metallicity has @xmath48 mag @xcite .",
    "adopting the gardner  ( 1993 ) luminosity function ( for our purposes , similar to the recent cole et al .",
    "2001 results ) , for which @xmath49 mag , we find that in the k band the number of globular clusters around a galaxy rises linearly with luminosity , @xmath50    to convert the normalization from globular cluster per galaxy to a volume normalization we use the luminosity density of galaxy light in the k band , @xmath51 .",
    "the normalizing constant for the gc luminosity function is defined such that the integral over all gc luminosities must be equal to the mean number of gc expected for the mean amount of galaxy light in that volume .",
    "that is , @xmath52 for gardner s ( 1993 ) @xmath53 schechter luminosity function fit @xmath54 , where @xmath55  mpc@xmath56 .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath57 cancels in eq .",
    "[ eq : norm ] . then the co - moving volume density is gcs is @xmath58  mpc@xmath56 , where @xmath59 .",
    "we adopt @xmath60 as a reasonable and somewhat conservative value , given that the bulk of the k light emerges from relatively luminous early type galaxies .",
    "figure  4 and table  3 of harris ( 1991 ) might suggest a value of about 3 for the early type galaxies , with evidence that strongly clustered early type galaxies have higher @xmath46 .",
    "of course the origin of these effects may well be directly visible in the future .",
    "the outcomes is that our complete gc luminosity function is , @xmath61       \\,dl_{\\bar{\\lambda}}.\\ ] ]    the redshift distribution per unit sky area of gc at a given flux level , is simply @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the volume element within the model cosmology .",
    "integrating over the redshift distribution gives the number - magnitude relation in practice , these calculations are done using magnitudes rather than fluxes .",
    "with the modeling apparatus in hand we first pause to show the low redshift @xmath64 at @xmath65 and @xmath66 mag in figure  [ fig : nzr ] .",
    "the total sky densities of the fz model at these depths are 87 , 321 , 1,260 and 4,840 per square degree per magnitude , respectively . these gcs will be clearly associated with relatively bright galaxies , typically about @xmath67 mag , with the redshift distributions shown .",
    "precisely how globular clusters form is , at this time , unknown .",
    "part of the point of this paper is that the plausible formation redshifts for the bulk of gcs will shortly come within reach of telescopes . to try to bracket the situation",
    ", we examine a number of somewhat extreme alternative models and look at the effects of co - ordinated bursts in a galaxy . to examine the importance of `` luminosity spikes '' at the time of formation , we use ( arbitrarily",
    ", for the purpose of illustration ) 10 bursts of star formation of duration 10  myr spread over the 0 to 1 gyr time interval .",
    "the formation age of all of the gc is put at 0.5 gyr .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : nzl ] .",
    "such bursts would only effect the counts in an area small enough that only a few dozen actively gc forming galaxies were present .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nzl_alt ] we use the same set of ten star formation bursts but shifted in time to the 1 to 2 gyr time interval with a uniform formation age of 1 gyr . clearly",
    "the bursts of star formation produce spikes in the redshift distribution but those effects quickly die away .",
    "it could be that the earliest phases of globular cluster formation are cloaked in dust which later disperses , following an age - extinction relation @xcite . in that case",
    "the high luminosity peaks will be a briefly obscured phase in the life of gcs .",
    "however the figures show that if those short - lived bright spikes are removed , neither the counts or redshift distribution will be greatly altered .",
    "the difference between the no - evolution and fz density evolution models are small at redshifts below about three , under the assumption that most globular clusters were formed at redshifts greater than three .",
    "the differences would be much larger if significant globular cluster formation continued to much lower redshift .",
    "the numbers predicted with a non - evolving mass model are nearly a full decade below the evolving model beyond redshifts of five .",
    "since density and luminosity evolution are independent in these models the same difference applies to all formation histories .",
    "the number - magnitude relation is shown in figure  [ fig : nm ] in the v , r ,",
    "j , k , l and m bands ( spanning roughly 0.5 to 5 microns ) for our model with ten , bursts of 10% of the mass , spread between 0 and 1  gyr .",
    "there are two effects . at low redshift",
    "the counts rise with increasing magnitude at a rate governed by the volume element , enhanced by k - corrections in an old , low metallicity , population .",
    "although not shown , at 1  njy in the v band the @xmath64 peaks at about redshift 0.3 . at 1  njy in the r band",
    "@xmath64 peaks at about redshift 0.5 , with a few of the actively star - forming @xmath68 clusters in formation being visible .",
    "clearly deep optical band observations are not the ideal way to probe the formation epoch .",
    "the character of the redshift distribution changes in the infrared bands as the peak of the spectrum is redshifted into them .",
    "the combination of k - correction and luminosity evolution causes the counts in the redder bands to rapidly climb to several million per square degree . as figure",
    "[ fig : nm ] shows , the counts are steeper than euclidean near 30 ab mag in the ir bands .",
    "the predicted counts for a wide range of model star formation histories are shown in figure  [ fig : nme ] .",
    "we display the l band counts for models having ten bursts of 10% of the final mass star formation extending over 10  myr in the 0 - 1 gyr interval ( triangles ) , the 1 - 2 gyr interval ( diamonds ) , and exponential models with @xmath69 pentagons ) , 2 ( heptagons ) and 4 gyr ( hexagons ) for both evolving and non - evolving mass function .",
    "the number - magnitude relation shows substantial model dependencies beginning at about 1  njy ( @xmath1 mag ) .",
    "however , the result that the l band counts will be around @xmath70 per mag per square degree at 0.2  njy is reasonably robust . it does not depend a lot on star formation , internal internal dust shrouding in the early phases , and is not unduly sensitive to the exact amount of gc density evolution .",
    "the biggest potential over - prediction of numbers is if gc initially form in dusty disk environments which makes them hard to detect .",
    "as long as the clusters become visible within about 2 gyr of formation the numbers predicted here should be fairly accurate .",
    "the basic prediction that the sky density becomes about @xmath0 per square degree around 1 njy is difficult to escape , given the assumptions about globular cluster origins , evolution and visibility made in this paper .",
    "globular clusters are strongly concentrated around their host galaxies . at the very low flux levels we are investigating here",
    "it is natural to ask to what degree this clustering will remain evident and whether the nano - jansky sky will effectively be covered with a nearly uniform distribution of gc . a prediction of clustering uses the results above but requires additional information about the degree to which galaxies and their gc systems merge into larger and larger units .",
    "furthermore , the host galaxies may not always be visible at the highest redshifts considered here , since galaxies are generally younger and much lower surface brightness than gcs .",
    "hence , the following estimates of galaxy - gc cross - correlations will be upper limits , although we do incorporate a model for galaxy merging into our calculations .",
    "the real space cross - correlation of galaxies and gcs can be derived from the average radial profile of gcs in their host galaxies . as shown below the auto - correlation of galaxies",
    "makes no significant contribution at the angles of interest .",
    "the fz calculations find that after approximately 1 to 2 gyr the radial distribution converges to a stable , nearly power - law form .",
    "an approximate power law fit to the milky - way data of harris ( 1996 ) is , @xmath71 if there is a core in the radial distribution it appears at a radius of order a few kpc where the gcs become superimposed on significant galaxy light and hard to find .",
    "the milky way is probably somewhat less than @xmath72 in luminosity and its gc system , with a total of @xmath73 clusters @xcite , has numbers about 2/3 half of the 240 expected at @xmath72 . to calculate the cross - correlation function with galaxies we need @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the mean density .",
    "we normalize these numbers to the volume average for @xmath72 galaxies .",
    "the mean gc density of @xmath76mpc@xmath56 we derived above becomes a physical density of @xmath77  kpc@xmath56 for @xmath78 .",
    "consequently we can re - express eq .",
    "[ eq : gcr ] , as the over - density , @xmath79 converting this to the standard correlation length form and using co - moving co - ordinates ( @xmath78 ) , @xmath80 where we have included the luminosity dependence , with @xmath81 being the luminosity of the host galaxy . note that an alternate description of this correlation length is @xmath82 . in this calculation we have assumed that the low redshift @xmath83 relationship holds in the earliest phases of the life of a galaxy which needs to be tested .",
    "an overall density normalization change has no effect on the correlations since the mean field density changes at the same rate , leaving @xmath84 invariant .",
    "gc systems appear to always be associated with more or less virialized galaxies .",
    "they are not part of a clustering hierarchy that extends into the linear regime .",
    "therefore we describe the over - density distribution as being fixed in physical co - ordinates .",
    "we therefore multiply eq .  [ eq : xi ] by the correlation function evolution term @xmath85 .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 is equal to @xmath87 for fixed over - density in physical co - ordinates , as is appropriate here .",
    "galaxies are assembled over time through the merger process .",
    "a simple model for the increase of mass @xmath11 is @xmath88 .",
    "approximating @xmath89 ( as in an empty universe ) this integrates to @xmath90 note that @xmath91 goes to zero for finite @xmath9 for @xmath92 .",
    "reasonable values are @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the resulting redshift dependent co - moving correlation function , @xmath95 , is , @xmath96    the angular correlation function is simply related to the volume correlation through a projection over redshift , @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath101 .",
    "we express the results as an angular correlation @xmath102 .",
    "we evaluate the integral using the l band @xmath64 at 1njy . for our @xmath103 mpc , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , we find @xmath106 and @xmath107 , with @xmath108 for @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , respectively and 21 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 for the same @xmath113 .",
    "correlation angles of @xmath114 correspond to physical distances of about 100  kpc around redshift three .",
    "therefore the bulk of the gcs will be clearly associated with their host galaxies .",
    "the galaxies , if they exist and are not obscured , will be some @xmath115 mag brighter than the gcs , depending on the relative roles of merging and luminosity evolution . at @xmath116 mag galaxies",
    "have mean sky separations of @xmath117 , so the sky will be effectively covered , albeit with a concentration toward galaxies , or , the still - dark halos that will become the sites of galaxies .",
    "the gc - galaxy cross - correlation calculation ignores the contribution due to galaxy - galaxy clustering .",
    "the same of calculation shows that the much shallower @xmath118 of galaxy clustering the auto - correlation angle is about 2 arcsec , for @xmath119 . for the gcs their steep cross - correlation with galaxies",
    "allows them to rapidly climb out of the projected distribution , which does not occur for the galaxy - galaxy correlation .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy contribution will only be visible at about an arc - minute , where the projected clustering amplitude is only @xmath120 . at angles",
    "less than 20  the contribution is less than 10% , given our modelling for clustering .",
    "of course globular cluster formation during merging is a special case .",
    "globular clusters are , in the main , very old objects , likely formed in the first quartile of the age of the universe , implying strong luminosity evolution at high redshift .",
    "the combination of k - corrections and luminosity evolution put the bulk of their energy in the 3 to 5 micron bands .",
    "for a fairly wide range of density and luminosity evolution models there should be approximately @xmath0 gc per square degree per magnitude , with a continuing steep rise in counts . in the optical bands the counts rise slowly with few gc appearing beyond redshift one .",
    "source confusion noise in flux and position measurements increases in proportion to the density of sources relative to the beam density , @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the problems associated with confusion begin to arise when the source density is about @xmath122% of the beam density .",
    "moreover the strong clustering of gc toward galaxies will create enhanced confusion in the neighborhood of galaxies .",
    "a diffraction limited 6 m telescope operating at @xmath123 will have one source per beam ( severe confusion ) at a sky density @xmath124 per square degree .",
    "for the relatively steep source counts found here and the high confidence detections that would be of interest to photometric redshift estimation techniques , the source density below about 1  njy presents an issue to be carefully approached . in detail",
    "this problem could be more quantitatively addressed with simulated observations using the predicted counts . in a future paper",
    "we will also consider a more detailed model that incorporates dust and emission line nebula effects and a number of potential astrophysical complications .    the large density of high redshift gcs is both an opportunity and a challenge . in as much as gc are key indicators of how the extended low metallicity stellar halos of galaxies came into being , observations at njy flux levels will directly probe their origins . on the other hand ,",
    "the sky densities and flux levels are similar to those predicted for zero metallicity , `` first light '' objects .",
    "it will require some care to distinguish a young cluster of fairly normal stars with strong ionizing radiation from the unusual zero metallicity stars that are the first luminous objects .",
    "it will be fascinating to understand the relationship between these two `` early light '' populations .",
