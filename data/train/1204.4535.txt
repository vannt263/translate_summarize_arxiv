    "a5/1 _ was developed in 1987 , then gsm was not considered for use outside europe . the description of the _ a5/1 _ was initially kept secret , but its design was disclosed in 1999 by reverse engineering @xcite .",
    "the gsm organization later confirmed the correctness of the algorithm @xcite .",
    "there are multiple versions of the encryption algorithm which belong to the _",
    "a5 _ family : _",
    "a5/0 _ is a dummy cipher with no encryption ; _",
    "a5/1 _ is the original _",
    "a5 _ algorithm ensures over - the - air communication privacy and confidentiality of conversations in gsm mobile phones ; _",
    "a5/2 _ is an intentionally weaker encryption algorithm created for export ; while _",
    "_ is a strong encryption algorithm created as part of the 3rd generation partnership project _ ( 3gpp ) _ which is currently responsible for maintaining and developing gsm technical specifications around the world @xcite .",
    "anderson @xcite , golic @xcite and babbage @xcite were the pioneers in cryptanalyzing the _",
    "a5/1 _ encryption algorithm when only a rough outline of the _ a5/1 _ was leaked .",
    "_ was reverse engineered , it was analyzed by biryukov , shamir and wagner @xcite ; biham and dunkelman @xcite ; ekdahl and johansson @xcite ; maximov , johansson and babbage @xcite ; barkan and biham @xcite ; keller and seitz @xcite ; and a few other researchers .",
    "several attacks on the _",
    "a5/1 _ stream cipher were designed in the past twenty years , but only a few of those were implemented .",
    "attacks on the gsm protocol can work even if the network supports only _",
    "a5/1 _ or _",
    "encryption , as long as the mobile phone supports _",
    "_ encryption .",
    "the main flaw that allows the implementation of these attacks is that the same key is used regardless of whether the phone encrypts using _ a5/1 _ , _ a5/2 _ , or _",
    "a5/3 _ algorithm .",
    "therefore , the attacker can mount a man - in - the - middle attack , in which the attacker impersonates the mobile to the network , and the network to the mobile ( by using a fake base station ) . the attacker might use _",
    "_ for communication with the network and _ a5/2 _ for communication with the mobile .",
    "but due to the flaw , both algorithms encrypt using the same key .",
    "the attacker can obtain the key through a passive attack on _ a5/2_. the attacker who is in the middle can eavesdrop , change the conversation , perform call theft , etc .",
    "the attack applies to all traffic including short message service ( sms ) @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we describe a new _ guess - and - determine _ attack on the _ a5/1 _ stream cipher .",
    "this attack has an average time complexity of @xmath0 , which is much less than a brute - force attack of @xmath1 .",
    "for every _ possible _ 19 bits of the register @xmath2 , we require storage of 100 mb to determine registers @xmath3 and @xmath4 given a known keystream ks .",
    "our attack can be briefly described as follows : we assume that the register @xmath2 is full with 19 bits and registers @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be filled progressively as the attack progresses . at any stage of this attack , @xmath2",
    "is completely filled and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are partially filled .",
    "we call these states as * state candidates*. once all three registers are completely filled , we call that state candidate a * complete state candidate*. this attack has a 100% success rate and requires about 5.65 gb storage . with the knowledge of only 11 bits of the known keystream , the attack algorithm is able to determine a set of 64-bit _ complete state candidates _ which may contain the key . with every additional clocking round of the attack , the number of complete state candidates increases .",
    "thus , the probability of finding the key among all the complete state candidates increases with every additional round after 11 clocking rounds .",
    "we provide a detailed description of our new attack along with its implementation and results in sections 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "the _ a5/1 _ stream cipher is built from three short linear feedback shift registers ( lfsrs ) of lengths @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 bits , denoted by @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the rightmost bit in each register is labeled as bit zero .",
    "the tapping bits of @xmath8 are at bit positions @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; the tapping bits of @xmath15 are at bit positions @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; and the tapping bits of @xmath10 are at bit positions @xmath18 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath6 ( table [ par ] ) .",
    "_ a5/1 _ register parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table ]",
    "our attack is based on the _ guess - and - determine _ approach proposed by anderson @xcite , but with several modifications . in this attack ,",
    "all bits of the first register @xmath8 are assumed to be known and all bits of registers @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined with 64 bits of the known _ keystream _ ( ks ) .",
    "this attack has an average time complexity of @xmath0 , which is much smaller than an exhaustive search . the average number of rounds necessary to obtain the correct key from the set of complete state candidates is 15.5 . with every round of clocking after 11 rounds , the number of complete state candidates increases .",
    "thus , the probability of finding the key increases with every clocking round .",
    "one can do the post - processing phase for a round simultaneously with the determination phase for the next round , and thus save time .",
    "the attack is successful with 100% probability and requires about 5.65 gb storage . with this",
    "we conclude that our attack is better than all known guess - and - determine attacks on the _ a5/1 _ stream cipher ."
