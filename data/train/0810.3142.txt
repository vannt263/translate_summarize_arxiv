    "color superconductivity(csc ) is expected to be the ground state in a quark matter of sufficiently high baryon density but low temperature @xcite .",
    "the most favorable pairing channel in the chiral limit is between quarks of different flavors . at the baryon density accessible in a compact star",
    ", however , the nonzero strange quark mass induces a significant mismatch between fermi momenta of different flavors that suppresses the phase space available for pairing .",
    "a lot of exotic csc states or mixed states have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "but the result of their competition remains under debate .",
    "since the single flavor pairing is free from the fermi momentum mismatch , it has been considered as an interesting alternative in this circumstance .",
    "the corresponding gap function in this case should contain higher total angular momentum as required by pauli principle , the obvious alternative is to consider the p - wave pairing(@xmath1)@xcite . a large variety of pairing structures of the single flavor csc has been discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "except for the color - spin - locked(csl ) state , none of the energy gaps is spherical .",
    "all these works restrict the angular dependence of a non - spherical gap within a single partial wave , @xmath2-wave , which is valid if the pairing potential consists of the @xmath2-channel only , such as that in the superfluid @xmath3 .",
    "the forward singularity of diquark scattering in qcd , however , brings in all angular momentum channels to the pairing potential . because of the nonlinearity of the gap equation , all partial waves contribute to a non - spherical energy gap at the _ same _ order of the qcd running coupling . in a previous paper@xcite",
    ", we examined this angular momentum mixing effect in the non - spherical csc with longitudinal pairing , in which the two pairing quarks carry the same helicity .",
    "we found that the energy gap ( gap function evaluated at zero matsubara energy ) takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the chemical potential , @xmath6 is the direction of the relative momentum in a cooper pair and the function @xmath7 is an infinite series in spherical harmonics of all @xmath8 s . in particular , we find @xmath9\\ ] ] in contrast with @xmath10 reported in the literature for the polar phase .",
    "the contributions from higher partial waves , however , are numerically small .",
    "the same effect is expected for the transverse pairing and the parallel analysis will be carried out in this paper .    the free energy density of the superconductivity with angular momentum mixing will be lowered relative to that containing p - wave pairing only . in the toy model considered in @xcite , which maximizes the forward singularity ,",
    "the magnitude of the condensation energy is increased by a factor of 1.54 . without including the angular momentum mixing , the gaining factor of the magnitude of the condensation energy in csc by forming the spherical csl state compared with the non - spherical polar state",
    "is 1.54 for the longitudinal pairing and 1.14 for the transverse pairing @xcite .",
    "this raises the issue to recalculate the condensation energy of various non - spherical pairing states of the single - flavor csc in the light of the angular momentum mixing and to compare the result with that of the spherical csl .",
    "so we did in previous works @xcite @xcite for the polar and a phases of the longitudinal pairing .",
    "the formulation we developed can be carried over readily to the polar and a phases of the transverse pairing and the parallel analysis is made in this work .",
    "we found that , like the longitudinal pairing case , the amount of mixing is numerically small so the slightly reduced free energy of the polar and a phases is not low enough to compete with the spherical csl phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we examine the quark propagator with transverse pairing .",
    "the condensation energy density and the gap equation will be obtained from the cjt effective action in section iii .",
    "the gap equation will be reduced to an nonlinear integral equation for the angular dependence with zero and nonzero azimuthal quantum number in section iv and their numerical solutions will be given there as well .",
    "we conclude in sec . v. some technical details about the full quark propagators and the relevant spherical harmonics are deferred to appendices a and b. our convention for the metric tensor",

    "our units are @xmath12 and 4-vectors are denoted by capital letters , @xmath13 with @xmath14 the matsubara energy , which becomes continuous at zero temperature , @xmath15 .",
    "though the general structure of the quark propagator in csc state has been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite , the formulation we developed below is particularly suitable to explore the angular momentum mixing in a transverse pairing state .",
    "we start with the thermal nambu - gorkov quark propagator @xmath16 , defined as @xmath17 > = t\\sum_\\nu\\int \\frac{d^3{\\bf p}}{(2\\pi)^3}e^{ip\\cdot x}{\\cal s}(p ) \\label{definition}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the nambu - gorkov(ng ) spinors , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath14 the matsubara energy and @xmath22 the euclidean time , @xmath23 imposes the euclidean time ordering and ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) run over the ng , dirac and color indexes . at zero temperature , @xmath26 .",
    "the ng spinors are defined by @xmath27 where , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are written in terms of the ordinary quark spinors , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the charge - conjugate spinors with the tilde standing for the transpose , and @xmath32 .",
    "it follows from the definition ( [ definition ] ) and the self - conjugation relation @xmath33 with @xmath34 that @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 the relation ( [ conjugation ] ) was proved in @xcite and the proof of ( [ antisymm ] ) proceeds similarly .",
    "the ng structure of the inverse propagator is @xmath39 where each block is a @xmath40 matrix with respect to dirac indexes and a @xmath41 matrix in color indexes .",
    "we shall focus on the off - diagonal blocks @xmath42 below .",
    "it is convenient to work in the chiral representation where @xmath43 and their charge - conjugate counterparts @xmath44 with @xmath45(@xmath46 ) the two - component left - handed(right - handed spinors ) and @xmath47 the second pauli matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 are decomposed accordingly .",
    "for example , @xmath49 with each block a @xmath50 matrix with respect to spinor indexes . for transverse pairing between different chiralities , @xmath51 .",
    "next , we consider the off - diagonal block @xmath52 and write @xmath53 where the circular basis @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 the unit vectors of the spherical coordinates of @xmath57 .",
    "we have @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60    performing a rotation about @xmath57 by an angle @xmath61 , we find @xmath62 for a copper pair of two quarks or two antiquarks of opposite helicity , the projection of its angular momentum in the direction @xmath57 has to be @xmath63 , which implies that @xmath64 . up to now , the coefficients @xmath65 s remain @xmath41 antisymmetric matrices in color space . for the polar phase and a phase considered in this work , we set @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the second gell - mann matrix .    the dirac structure of other off - diagonal elements in eq.([3 ] )",
    "can be deduced from the relations ( [ conjugation ] ) and ( [ antisymm ] ) .",
    "we now could write down the inverse full quark propagator in chiral representation using the dyson - schwinger equation and ignoring the contribution from the wave - function renormalization , and reads @xmath69 inverting the matrix ( [ 21])(see the appendix a for details ) , we find that @xmath70 with    @xmath71    [ 25 ]    we notice that @xmath72 associates with particles and @xmath73 with antiparticles . the is because we designate implicitly the momentum @xmath74 to the quark of positive helicity in a cooper pair .",
    "since the contribution from the cooper pairs of antiquarks goes beyond the subleading order , we shall approximate @xmath75 and introduce the gap function @xmath76 via @xmath77 as is the same with 2sc , the solution to the gap equation gives rise to an even function in the matsubara energy , we have @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in this section , we shall derive the gap equation for the transverse pairing .",
