    "about a year ago , we reported that the compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 exhibits heavy fermion superconductivity below a critical temperature @xmath2 k @xcite .",
    "the heavy fermion state is characterized by an effective mass @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the free electron mass . to our knowledge , this is the first heavy fermion superconductor based on pr ; all of the other known heavy fermion superconductors ( about @xmath6 ) are compounds of ce or u. in an effort to obtain information about the interactions that are responsible for the heavy fermion state and the superconductivity of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , we have performed measurements of certain normal and superconducting state properties of this compound as a function of temperature , pressure , and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "an analysis of magnetic susceptibility @xmath7 , specific heat @xmath8 , and inelastic neutron scattering ins measurements on pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 within the context of a cubic crystalline electric field ( cef ) yielded a pr@xmath9 energy level scheme with a @xmath10 nonmagnetic doublet ground state that carries an electric quadrupole moment , a low lying @xmath11 triplet excited state at @xmath12 k above the ground state , and @xmath13 triplet and @xmath14 singlet excited states at much higher energies ( @xmath15 k and @xmath16 k , respectively ) .",
    "this scenario suggests that the underlying mechanism of the heavy fermion behavior in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 may involve electric quadrupole fluctuations , rather than magnetic dipole fluctuations .",
    "it also raises the possibility that electric quadrupole fluctuations play a role in the superconductivity of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 . in magnetic fields",
    "greater than @xmath17 t and at temperatures below @xmath18 k , we have also found evidence for the existence of a region in which there is magnetic or quadrupolar order @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the superconducting phase may occur in the vicinity of a magnetic or quadrupolar quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the first evidence that the superconductivity of the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 develops out of a heavy fermi liquid emerged from measurements of the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath8 .",
    "specific heat data from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in the form of a plot of @xmath19 vs @xmath20 between @xmath21 k and @xmath22 k for a pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 pressed pellet ( formed by pressing a collection of small single crystals in a cylindrical die ) are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath8 data have been corrected for sb inclusions derived from the molten sb flux in which the crystals were grown .",
    "the line in the figure represents the expression @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are electronic and phonon contributions , respectively , and @xmath26 represents a schottky anomaly for a two level system consisting of a doublet ground state and a triplet excited state at an energy @xmath27 above the ground state .",
    "the best fit of this expression to the data yields the values @xmath28 = @xmath29 mj / mol k@xmath30 , @xmath31 mj / mol k@xmath32 ( corresponding to a debye temperature @xmath33 k ) , and @xmath34 k. superimposed on the schottky anomaly is a feature in the specific heat due to the onset of superconductivity at @xmath2 k which is also observed as an abrupt drop in @xmath35 to zero and as a sharp onset of diamagnetism in @xmath36 .",
    "the feature in @xmath37 due to the superconductivity is also shown in the top inset of fig .",
    "[ heat ] along with an entropy conserving construction from which the ratio of the jump in specific heat @xmath38 at @xmath39 to @xmath39 , @xmath40 mj / mol k@xmath30 , has been estimated . using the bcs relation @xmath41 , this yields an estimate for @xmath28 of @xmath42 mj / mol k@xmath30 .",
    "this value is comparable to that inferred for the fit of the @xmath19 vs @xmath20 data in the normal state above @xmath39 , and indicative of heavy fermion behavior . a similar analysis of the @xmath8 data taken at the university of karlsruhe on several single crystals of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 prepared in our laboratory yielded @xmath43 mj / mol k@xmath30 , @xmath44 k , @xmath45 k , and @xmath46 , much higher than the bcs value of 1.43 and indicative of strong coupling effects @xcite .",
    "although the values of @xmath28 determined from these experiments vary somewhat , they are all indicative of a heavy electron ground state and an effective mass @xmath3 .",
    "divided by temperature @xmath20 , @xmath19 , vs. @xmath20 for a pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 pressed pellet .",
    "the line represents a fit of the sum of electronic , lattice , and schottky contributions to the data .",

    "lower inset : @xmath19 vs @xmath20 near @xmath39 for pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 single crystals , showing the structure in @xmath38 near @xmath39 .",
    "data from ref . @xcite . ]    further evidence of heavy fermion superconductivity is provided by the upper critical field @xmath50 vs @xmath20 curve shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] @xcite .",
    "the slope of the @xmath50 curve near @xmath39 can be used to determine the orbital critical field @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the flux quantum , and , in turn , the superconducting coherence length @xmath53 , yielding the value @xmath54  .",
    "the bcs relation @xmath55 can be used to estimate the fermi velocity @xmath56 and , in turn , the effective mass @xmath57 by means of the relation @xmath58 . using a simple free electron model to estimate the fermi wave vector @xmath59 ,",
    "an effective mass @xmath60 has been obtained @xcite .",

    "phase diagram of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 showing the regions containing the superconductivity ( sc ) and the high field ordered phase ( hfop ) .",
    "the dashed line is a measure of the splitting between the pr@xmath62 ground state and @xmath11 excited state ( see text for further details ) .",
    "data from refs . @xcite . ]",
    "several features in the superconducting properties of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 indicate that the superconductivity of this compound is unconventional in nature .",
    "first , @xmath8 follows a power law t - dependence , @xmath63 , after the schottky anomaly and @xmath25 lattice contributions have been subtracted from the @xmath8 data .",
    "second , there is a ` double - step ' structure in the jump in @xmath8 near @xmath39 in single crystals ( lower inset of fig .  [ heat ] ) that suggests that there are two distinct superconducting phases with different @xmath39 s : @xmath64 k and @xmath65 k @xcite .",
    "this structure is not evident in the @xmath8 data near @xmath39 taken on the pressed pellet of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ heat ] , possibly due to strains in the single crystals out of which the pressed pellet is comprised that broaden the transitions at @xmath66 and @xmath67 so that they overlap and become indistinguishable .",
    "however , at this point , it is not clear whether these two apparent jumps in @xmath8 are associated with two distinct superconducting phases or are due to sample inhomogeneity .",
    "it is noteworthy that all of the single crystal specimens prepared in our laboratory and investigated by our group and our collaborators exhibit this ` double - step ' structure .",
    "multiple superconducting transitions , apparently associated with distinct superconducting phases , have previously been observed in two other heavy fermion superconductors , upt@xmath68 and u@xmath69th@xmath70be@xmath71 .",
    "measurements of the specific heat in magnetic fields reveal that the two superconducting features shift downward in temperature at nearly the same rate with increasing field , consistent with the smooth temperature dependence of the @xmath72 curve .",
    "these two transitions have also been observed in thermal expansion measurements @xcite , which , from the ehrenfest relation , reveal that @xmath66 and @xmath67 have considerably different pressure dependencies , suggesting that they are associated with two distinct superconducting phases .",
    "recent transverse field @xmath73sr @xcite and sb - nqr measurements @xcite on pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 are consistent with an isotropic energy gap . along with the specific heat ,",
    "these measurements indicate strong coupling superconductivity .",
    "these findings suggest an s - wave , or , perhaps , a balian - werthamer p - wave order parameter .",
    "recently , the superconducting gap structure of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 was investigated by means of thermal conductivity measurements in magnetic fields rotated relative to the crystallographic axes by izawa et al .",
    "these measurements reveal two regions in the @xmath74 plane , a low field region in which @xmath75 has two point nodes , and a high field region where @xmath75 has six point nodes .",
    "the line lying between the low and high field superconducting phases may be associated with the transition at @xmath67 , whereas the line between the high field phase and the normal phase , @xmath72 , converges with @xmath66 as h @xmath76 .",
    "clearly , more research will be required to further elucidate the nature of the superconducting state in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "magnetic susceptibility @xmath77 measurements on pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 indicate that it has a nonmagnetic ground state . according to lea , leask , and wolf @xcite , in a cubic cef , the pr@xmath78 hund s rule multiplet splits into a @xmath14 singlet , a @xmath10 nonmagnetic doublet that carries an electric quadrupole moment , and @xmath13 and @xmath11 triplets . in order to analyze the @xmath77 data",
    ", it was assumed that the pr@xmath9 ions are , to first approximation , noninteracting and the nonmagnetic ground state corresponds to either a @xmath14 singlet or @xmath10 nonmagnetic doublet ground state @xcite .",
    "although reasonable fits to the @xmath77 data could be obtained for both @xmath14 and @xmath10 ground states , the most satisfactory fit was obtained for a @xmath10 nonmagnetic doublet ground state with a @xmath11 first excited triplet state at @xmath79 k and @xmath13 and @xmath14 second and third excited states at 130 k and 313 k , respectively .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements on pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 reveal transitions at @xmath80 mev ( @xmath81 k ) and @xmath82 mev ( @xmath83 k ) that appear to be associated with transitions between the @xmath10 ground state and the @xmath11 first and @xmath13 second excited states , respectively , that are in good agreement with the pr@xmath9 cef energy level scheme determined from the analysis of the @xmath7 data . as noted above , the schottky anomaly in the @xmath8 data on pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 taken at ucsd and at the university of karlsruhe @xcite can be described well by a two level system consisting of a doublet ground state and a low lying triplet excited state with a splitting of @xmath84 k , a value that is comparable to the values deduced from the @xmath77 and ins data . however ,",
    "a @xmath14 ground state can not , at this point , be completely excluded .    while a magnetic @xmath13 or @xmath11 pr@xmath9 ground state could produce a nonmagnetic heavy fermion ground state via an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( kondo effect )",
    ", the behavior of @xmath85 of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 in the normal state does not resemble the behavior of @xmath85 expected for this scenario . for a typical magnetically induced heavy fermion compound",
    ", @xmath85 often increases with decreasing temperature due to kondo scattering , reaches a maximum , and then decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature as the highly correlated heavy fermion state forms below the coherence temperature . at low temperatures",
    ", @xmath85 varies as @xmath86 with a prefactor @xmath87 [ @xmath88  cm  k@xmath30(mj / mol)@xmath89 @xmath90 that is consistent with the kadowaki - woods relation @xcite . in contrast",
    ", pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 has a very typical metallic resistivity with negative curvature at higher temperatures and a pronounced ` roll off ' below @xmath91 k before it vanishes abruptly when the compound becomes superconducting .",
    "the ` roll off ' in @xmath85 appears to be due to a decrease in charge or spin dependent scattering from the low lying pr@xmath9 cef energy level due to the decrease in population of this level as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the @xmath85 data can be described by a temperature dependence of the form @xmath86 between @xmath91 k and @xmath92 k , but with a prefactor @xmath93  cm / k@xmath30 that is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than that expected from the kadowaki - woods relation which yields @xmath94  cm / k@xmath30 for @xmath95 mj / mol k@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "( interestingly , @xmath85 is consistent with @xmath96 behavior with a value @xmath97  cm / k@xmath30 in fields of @xmath98 t in the high field ordered phase discussed in section @xmath99 . )",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath100 is similar to that observed for the compound prinag@xmath101 which has an enormous @xmath28 of @xmath102 j / mol k@xmath30 and a @xmath10 nonmagnetic doublet ground state @xcite .",
    "the compounds pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , prinag@xmath101 , and another pr - based skutterudite , prfe@xmath103p@xmath1 @xcite , may belong to a new class of heavy fermion compounds in which the heavy fermion state is produced by electric quadrupole fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , magnetic dipole fluctuations are widely believed to be responsible for the heavy fermion state in most ce and u heavy fermion compounds ( with the possible exception of certain u compounds such as ube@xmath104 ) .",
    "another possible source of the enhanced effective mass in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 may involve excitations from the ground state to the the low lying first excited state in the pr@xmath9 cef energy level scheme @xcite .",
    "evidence for a high field ordered phase was first derived from magnetoresistence measurements in the temperature range @xmath105 mk @xmath106 k and magnetic fields up to @xmath107 tesla @xcite .",
    "the @xmath74 phase diagram , showing the superconducting region and the high field ordered phase is shown in fig .",
    "the line that intersects the high field ordered state represents the inflection point of the ` roll - off ' in @xmath35 at low temperatures and is a measure of the splitting between the pr@xmath9 ground and the first excited states which decreases with field .",
    "the high field ordered phase has also been observed by means of large peaks in the specific heat @xcite and thermal expansion @xcite and kinks in magnetization vs magnetic field curves @xcite in magnetic fields @xmath108 t and temperatures @xmath109 k.",
    "experiments on the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 have revealed a number of extraordinary phenomena : a heavy fermion state characterized by an effective mass @xmath4 , unconventional superconductivity below @xmath39 = @xmath110 with two distinct superconducting phases , and a high field phase , presumably associated with magnetic or electric quadrupolar order .",
    "analysis of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath85 , and ins data indicate that pr@xmath9 has a nonmagnetic @xmath10 doublet ground state that carries an electric quadrupole moment , a low lying @xmath11 triplet excited state at @xmath12 k , and @xmath13 triplet and @xmath14 singlet excited states at much higher energies .",
    "this suggests that the interaction between the quadrupole moments of the pr@xmath9 ions and the charges of the conduction electrons and excitations between the @xmath10 ground state and @xmath11 low lying excited state may play an important role in generating the heavy fermion state and superconductivity in this compound .",
