    "over the past several years there has been a renewal of interest in the physics of lorentz symmetry violation .",
    "these investigations are largely motivated by the enduring problem of quantum gravity and also cosmological mysteries such as the dark matter and dark energy problems .",
    "lorentz violation ( lv ) effects in standard model extensions and modified particle dispersion relations are currently tightly constrained by high precision tests @xcite , however constraints on gravitational lv effects are not as severe .",
    "various approaches to incorporating lv into gravity have been investigated , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper we will consider  einstein - aether \" theory ( or ae - theory , for short )",
    "@xcite , which consists of a dynamical unit timelike vector field @xmath0 coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "the @xmath0  aether \" field can be thought of as the 4-velocity of a preferred frame .",
    "the lv here is a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking , since the unit timelike constraint requires the vector field to have a non - zero value everywhere in any solution , even flat spacetime .",
    "the lagrangian of ae - theory depends on four dimensionless coupling constants @xmath1 . by studying the phenomenology of ae - theory",
    "it can be compared with observations in order to constrain the @xmath2 values and possibly rule the theory out entirely as a description of nature .",
    "observational constraints on ae - theory have been determined from parameterized post - newtonian analysis  @xcite , stability and energy positivity  @xcite , primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite , and vacuum cerenkov radiation  @xcite .",
    "the combined constraints from all of these are reviewed in ref .",
    "they are all consistent with a large ( order unity ) 2d region in the 4d parameter space .",
    "agreement with weak field radiation damping ( such as in binary pulsar systems )  @xcite is expected to restrict the parameters to a narrow band of width @xmath3 in that 2d region , and combined constraints from many such systems may further narrow the allowed region to a small neighborhood of the origin , with size of order @xmath4-@xmath5 .",
    "it is likely that theories with lv can generally be more tightly constrained by examining strong field solutions .",
    "in addition , the properties of such solutions may also be of interest from a purely mathematical physics perspective since the additional fields that couple to gr can produce interesting new sorts of solutions and phenomena .",
    "black hole solutions have been considered in the ghost condensate theory @xcite , and spherically symmetric solutions in the relativistic mond theory were studied in @xcite .",
    "work on this subject in ae - theory was begun long ago in special cases  @xcite , and a study of the solutions for general values of the coupling parameters was completed recently in @xcite and @xcite .    in these papers",
    "the time independent spherically symmetric solutions in ae - theory were characterized by examining the field equations as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "it was demonstrated that there is generically a three parameter family of solutions to these equations .",
    "imposing the boundary condition of asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity reduces the solution space to a two parameter family .",
    "this differs from gr , in which there is a unique spherically symmetric solution , the schwarzschild metric , which is automatically asymptotically flat .",
    "the one parameter subset of solutions where @xmath0 is aligned with the timelike killing vector was found analytically and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that this solution describes the exterior of a static fluid star .",
    "regular black holes in ae - theory must be described by a different solution , since the aether is a timelike vector so it can not coincide with the killing vector which is null on the horizon and spacelike inside .",
    "that is , the aether must be flowing into the black hole .",
    "moreover , the theory possesses spin-2 , spin-1 , and spin-0  massless \" wave modes that travel at speeds that differ from one another and from the metric speed of light  @xcite . to qualify as a black hole ,",
    "a solution must therefore contain a region where all of these wave modes are trapped .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that in spherical symmetry , regularity at the metric , spin-2 , and spin-1 horizons is automatic , but regularity at the spin-0 horizon is a supplementary condition .",
    "this condition reduces the two - parameter family of asymptotically flat solutions to a one - parameter family characterized by the total mass or horizon area .",
    "particular black hole solutions with regular spin-0 horizons were found by numerical integration for special cases of the coupling parameters . like the schwarzschild solution",
    ", these solutions have spacelike singularities at the origin , and in the exterior the metric functions are very close to the familiar schwarzschild solution , even for fairly large coupling constants @xmath2 .",
    "( the differences become more pronounced in the black hole interior . ) for certain large values of the coupling constants no black hole solution with a regular spin-0 horizon was found .    from an astrophysical point of view ,",
    "an important question is which solutions describe the final state of a gravitational collapse of matter fields . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that the solutions with regular spin-0 horizons  when they exist  are the ones that arise from collapse of initially nonsingular data .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to test that conjecture by numerical evolution of the time dependent spherically symmetric field equations given appropriate collapsing initial data .",
    "a massless scalar field coupled only to the metric will serve as the matter field .",
    "in section [ aetheory ] we review the nature and status of einstein - aether theory , and discuss the nature of black holes in this theory .",
    "section [ ivform ] together with the appendix develops the initial value formulation under the assumption that the aether vector is hypersurface orthogonal , as is always the case in spherical symmetry .",
    "the results of numerical collapse simulations are presented in section [ numresults ] .",
    "we find that the collapsing scalar field does indeed reach a final stationary black hole state with a regular spin-0 horizon , for the range of coupling constants found in @xcite to allow such states . outside this range of @xmath2",
    "we find solutions that develop a finite area singularity at the would - be spin-0 horizon .",
    "the numerical evolution procedure also allows for wider explorations of space of @xmath2 than was done in  @xcite .",

    "thus after writing out the einstein field equations one must solve them for these second time derivatives .",
    "in particular , some straightforward but tedious algebra applied to equation ( [ aestress ] ) yields ( h^ab + u^au^b ) & = & - ( c_13 + 3c_2)l_u k + c_14(d_aa^a+a_aa^a ) + & + & 2p^2 - 2 c_13k_abk^ab + c_123 k^2 [ splusrho ] + - h_a^bu^ct_bc & = & - p d_a + & - & c_14 ( 2 k_aba^b - k a_a + l_ua_a ) [ tzeroi ] where @xmath105 and @xmath106 . using equation ( [ splusrho ] ) in equation ( [ evolvek ] ) and solving for @xmath107 yields ( 2+c_13 + 3c_2 ) & l_u k & = ( c_14 - 2)(d_aa^a+a_aa^a ) + 2 p^2 + & + & 2(1-c_13)k_abk^ab + c_123k^2 .",

    "however , eliminating this term using equation ( [ evolvea ] ) yields the following constraint = ( 1+c_2)d_ak - p d_a[constraink2 ] which can be used to rewrite the equation of motion for @xmath109 as & = & - 2 k_aba^b+ka_a + c_13 p d_a + & - & c_123 d_a k. [ evolvea2 ]    the usual hamiltonian constraint of general relativity is r+k^2-k^abk_ab = 2 t_abu^au^b [ hamrel ] where @xmath110 is the scalar curvature of the spatial metric .",
    "however , it follows from equation ( [ aestress ] ) that 2 t_abu^au^b & = & 2 c_14 d_aa^a + p^2 + d_a + & + & c_14 a_aa^a - c_2 k^2 - c_13k_abk^ab .",

    "[ hamrel2 ]    we now impose spherical symmetry .",
    "we use as a radial coordinate @xmath50 the length in the radial direction ( rather than an area coordinate ) .",
