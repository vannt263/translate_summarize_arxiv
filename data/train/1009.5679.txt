    "@xmath7cdm cosmological models ( e.g. , @xcite ) for structure formation in the universe predict many compact dark - matter structures , _ minihalos _ , in the regions near galaxies and galaxy groups .",
    "@xcite predicts that minihalos may have a late phase of gas accretion , which will be detectable in h i  observations .",
    "it has been proposed that at least part of the population of neutral hydrogen high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) surrounding the milky way may represent these h i  -embedded dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "other possible origins of the hvcs include galactic fountains @xcite , tidal stripping from major and satellite galaxy interactions @xcite , and cold accretion of primordial gas @xcite .",
    "observations of the north galactic polar region by the alfalfa survey may have revealed low h i  mass minihalos surrounding the milky way @xcite ; however , these clouds may also be part of the magellanic stream .",
    "searches for h i  counterparts to these minihalos within galaxy groups have yielded non - detections or detections that do not match the predicted phase space ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper , we conduct an h i  survey of a 8.7@xmath0 @xmath1 21.3 @xmath0 region of a nearby complex of galaxies known as the  m81 filament \" @xcite , in an extensive search for h i  clouds that may trace in h i  a population of  @xmath8 dark matter minihalos  @xcite .",
    "the m81 filament includes the m81/m82 and ngc 2403 galaxy groups and the region between them .",
    "it is likely that the linearly shaped set of galaxies is contained within a dark - matter filament of the type commonly seen to form in cosmological simulations .",
    "the extent of the dark - matter and hot gaseous halos of these two groups is unknown  in fact , the m81/m82 group is sometimes considered to encompass the ngc 2403 group as part of one cluster @xcite .",
    "if this is true , then we may expect to detect pressure - confined clouds that trace cold accretion and h i  -laced dark matter halos in between the two groups , as well as galaxy interaction - generated h i  clouds near the strongly interacting m81 group . with wide velocity coverage and high sensitivity over such a large area ,",
    "this campaign was designed create a census of the more massive h i  clouds , which may be counterparts to minihalos or generated by galaxy interactions .    in section [ obsec ] ,",
    "we summarize the observations . in section [ datasec ]",
    ", we describe the data reduction process . in section [ interp ]",
    ", we discuss the interpretation of the data and sensitivity limits .",
    "section [ ressec ] describes our detections . in section [ simsec ]",

    "finally , section [ consec ] contains discussion , and we draw conclusions and discuss future work . in appendix",
    "a , we present the h i  properties of the galaxies in the observed volume .",
    "observations were carried out with the 100 m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the nrao in 40 sessions between june 2003 and august 2009 .",
    "this includes data taken for previously published observations of the m81/m82 and ngc 2403 galaxy groups ; see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "we combined the 40 observing sessions into a single 8.7@xmath0 @xmath1 21.3 @xmath0 map centered at 08@xmath940@xmath1037.0@xmath11 , 69@xmath017@xmath1216@xmath13 .",
    "figure [ mom0 ] shows a layout of the observations .",
    "the filament was observed by moving the telescope in declination and sampling every @xmath14 with an integration time of 1 - 3 seconds per sample , depending on the observation session .",
    "strips of constant declination were spaced by @xmath14 .",
    "corresponding maps were made by moving the telescope in right ascension to form a ` basket weave ' pattern over the region .",
    "total integration time for the entire map was approximately 187 hours . in figure [ rmsfig ]",
    "it is possible to infer the rms noise and corresponding mass sensitivity of the map as a function of position .",
    "the gbt spectrometer was used with a bandwith of either 12.5 or 50 mhz , depending on the observation session .",
    "the combined bandwidth for the final map is 10.5 mhz , corresponding to a velocity range from -890 to 1320 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the typical system temperature for each channel of the dual - polarization receiver was @xmath15 20 k.    our observations cover a large angular area in order to make a complete study of the h i  properties across the entire extent of the filament .",
    "the beam size of the gbt in the 21 cm line is @xmath16 , which maps to approximately 10 kpc at the distance of the m81 filament .",
    "this is well matched to the angular size of known h i  clouds above our mass detection threshold @xcite .",
    "predictions for the sizes of dark - matter minihalos range from 3 - 30 kpc in diameter @xcite ; we may be unable to detect minihalo clouds with a @xmath17 10 kpc diameter due to beam dilution .",
    "the gbt data were reduced in the standard manner using the gbtidl and aips data reduction packages .    in order to match our velocity resolution to the expected linewidths of h i   clouds in the group ,",
    "spectra were smoothed to a channel spacing of 24.4 khz , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 5.2 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a reference spectrum for each of the observation sessions was made using an observation of an emission - free region , usually from the edges of the maps .",
    "the reference spectrum was then used to perform a ( signal - reference)/reference calibration of each pixel .",
    "the calibrated spectra were scaled by the system temperature , corrected for atmospheric opacity and gbt efficiency .",
    "we adopted the gbt efficiency equation ( 1 ) from @xcite with a zenith atmospheric opacity @xmath18 = 0.009 .",
    "velocities are in the kinematic lsr velocity frame .",
    "the frequency range observed was relatively free of rfi , with less than 0.2% of all spectra adversely affected .",
    "the spectra exhibiting rfi were identified by tabulating the rms noise level in channels free of neutral hydrogen emission .",
    "spectra that showed high values of rms noise across many channels were flagged and removed .",
    "observations were gridded using the aips task sdimg , which also averages polarizations .",
    "after amplitude calibration and gridding , a 1st - order polynomial was fit to line - free regions of the spectra and subtracted from the gridded spectra using the aips task imlin . only the channels in the velocity range -400 to -800 km",
    "s@xmath2 were used for the fit .",
    "this simple baseline fit was extrapolated to the positive velocity range , where galaxies make a baseline fit unreliable .",
    "this baseline velocity range for the fit yielded a flat baseline for areas free of strong continuum radio sources , which is true of the majority of the region .",
    "the effective angular resolution , determined from maps of 3c286 , is 9.15@xmath19 0.05 . to convert to units of flux density , we observed the calibration source 3c286 , whose flux density is 14.57 @xmath19 0.94 jy at 1.418 ghz @xcite .",
    "the calibration from k to jy was derived by mapping 3c286 in the same way that the h i  maps were produced .",
    "after all corrections for the gbt efficiency and the mapping process , the scale factor from k / beam to jy / beam images is 0.43 @xmath19 0.03 . due to the patchwork nature of the observations ,",
    "the rms noise varies considerably across the datacube , ranging between 6 - 30 mjy / beam .",
    "the average rms noise in the final data cube is 20 mjy per 24.4 khz channel .",
    "figure [ rmsfig ] shows the map sensitivity as a function of position .",
    "the instrumental parameters are summarized in table 2 , and table 3 gives a summary of the observations .",
    "the spectral line images are available on - line .",
    "in order to detect either h i  clouds associated with dark matter minihalos , or cold accretion , a large - area map is required .",
    "h i  clouds in dark matter minihalos are predicted to be found at distances of up to 1 mpc from a major halo @xcite .",
    "cold accretion clouds and interaction - generated clouds are expected to be contained within a @xmath15 60 kpc radius around large galaxies @xcite .",
    "our map has a projected size of 480 kpc @xmath1 1.2 mpc , which is adequate to detect all three phenomena .",
    "spectral maps were made in the velocity range overlapped by all observations , from -890 to 1320 km s@xmath2 .",
    "spectral maps were visually inspected for possible new h i  clouds .",
    "we required a cloud candidate to be visible in at least two channels , therefore the lowest velocity width that could be detected was 10 km s@xmath2 . for each candidate ,",
    "a plot of intensity versus velocity was also produced and checked . at the locations of strong continuum radio sources ,",
    "the linear spectral baseline fit was occasionally poor . in these cases",
    ", the spectra would show a broad slope , @xmath20 400 km s@xmath2 wide , either increasing or decreasing with frequency .",
    "candidates in the regions with poor spectral baseline were also discarded .",
    "only 26 of the more than 10,000 gbt beams covering the map showed spectra with poor spectral baselines .",
    "the mass detection threshold was calculated assuming that clouds would be unresolved in the gbt beam , using the relation :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the average distance to the filament , @xmath23 is the rms noise in one channel , @xmath24 is the channel width , and @xmath25 is the number of channels required for a secure detection . for this calculation",
    ", we used an h i  cloud linewidth of 20 km s@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "this assumed linewidth strikes a balance between narrower hvc lines @xcite and the wider linewidths of massive h i  clouds @xcite .    adopting the m81 distance of 3.6 mpc , the 1@xmath4 mass detection threshold ranges from 2.5 to 12.9 @xmath1 10@xmath27 m@xmath6 , as shown in figure [ rmsfig ] .",
    "the average 5@xmath4 detection threshold for h i  mass was 3.2 @xmath1 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 . with this threshold , we would be able to detect analogues to the most massive clouds around m31 and m33 , the m81/m82 clouds , the m101 cloud , and large milky way objects such as complexes c and h and the magellanic stream",
    ". we would also be able to detect cold accretion clouds found in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "we discovered 5 new h i  clouds .",
    "we divide these clouds into two groups , those associated with the m81 filament and those associated with the milky way .",
    "we determine the most likely association of each cloud based on its position and velocity .",
    "there is some overlap in velocity space between the m81 filament and the milky way , and over the velocity range -85 to 25 km s@xmath2 , we can not discriminate between local and distant emission .",
    "in addition , the galactic hvc complex a , which ranges in velocity from -120 km s@xmath2 to -200 km s@xmath2 , coincides with part of the mapped region @xcite .",
    "therefore we can not distinguish h i  clouds in this position and velocity range from complex a.    all of the h i  clouds we previously detected @xcite are visible in this extended image .",
    "their locations are marked in figure [ mom0 ] . in order to unify the clouds identified in this paper with those in @xcite and @xcite , and any h i  clouds identified with the gbt in our current and future observations",
    ", we have re - designated the clouds with the identifier gbc for  green bank cloud \" , and the coordinates of the cloud , i.  e.   gbc jhhmmss.s+ddmmss .",
    "these designations are found in table [ fil_cloudprop ] . to distinguish the newly discovered clouds from the clouds previously discovered ,",
    "the new clouds are designated with c10 - 1 to c10 - 5 .",

    "spectra are shown in figure [ cloud_ispec ] .",
    "figure [ fil_analysis ] shows the locations of all h i  clouds that we have determined to be located within m81 filament .",
    "cloud masses were calculated using    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the total flux of the cloud .",
    "error estimates on the masses difficult to obtain , given the wide range in rms noise values over the map .",
    "the dominant error contribution is the approximately 7% uncertainty in the absolute calibration for these observations .",
    "cloud c10 - 1 ( gbc j092635.8 + 702850 ) is to the northwest of the m81 group . with a velocity of -178 km s@xmath2 , cloud c10 - 1 may be part of complex a. however , complex a does not overlap in position with cloud c10 - 1 , so we include this cloud in further analysis of h i  clouds in the m81 filament .",
    "cloud c10 - 2 ( gbc j101926.3 + 675222 ) is south of ic 2574 and an adjacent hijass source , hijass j1021 + 6840 @xcite and has a velocity of 38 km s@xmath2 .",
    "cloud c10 - 3 ( gbc j091952.7 + 680937 ) is to the southwest of the m81 group and has a velocity of -108 km s@xmath2 .",

    "cloud c10 - 4 has a velocity of 69 km s@xmath30      cloud c10 - 5 ( gbc j071051.4 + 654428 ) is west of the clouds reported in @xcite and shows a high negative velocity .",
    "it is visible in 5 channels and is extended spatially .",
    "it is offset by about 100 km s@xmath2 from complex a , and may be a separate milky way hvc .",
    "cloud c10 - 5 has a velocity -301 km s@xmath2 , which falls outside the velocity range of complex a @xcite .",
    "there are galactic hvcs detected with velocities a large as -450 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these observations can not confidently determine whether cloud 10 - 5 is associated with the m81 filament or with the milky way .",
    "in order to determine whether the h i  clouds in the m81 filament have the properties expected for gas - embedded dark - matter halos , we have compared their properties statistically with the properties of dark matter halos generated by n - body simulations .",
    "analysis includes the clouds detected in this paper , in addition to the clouds from @xcite and @xcite . for this analysis",
    "we only include the h i  clouds located in the 8@xmath0 @xmath1 8@xmath0 region centered on m81 , due to the greater rms noise and contamination by complex a in other regions of the map",
    ". therefore this analysis excludes clouds c10 - 5 , c09 -1 , c09 - 2 , and c09 - 3 .",
    "figure [ fil_analysis ] shows the region of the m81 filament that was compared to the simulation , with h i  clouds marked .",
    "we conducted two dark matter - only cosmological n - body simulations for comparison .",
    "one simulation uses initial conditions from wmap3 , and one from wmap5 .",
    "we simulated a 50@xmath31 mpc@xmath31 volume of the universe from z=149 to z=0 using 256@xmath31 particles .",
    "at redshift zero , we selected a volume 10 mpc on a side to resimulate with 512@xmath31 particles with a zoom technique aimed to preserve the tidal field outside the higher resolution volume .",
    "this smaller volume was selected to host a @xmath32 halo at z=0  this halo is consistent with the m81 galaxy .",
    "figure [ simfig ] shows a z=0 snapshot of the simulation .",
    "we used a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length of @xmath33 to identify dark matter halos , and used a subfind technique to determine the bound subhalos .    in order to connect the numerical simulations with the properties of h i  observations , we require an estimate of the h i  to dark matter mass fraction",
    "the distribution of h i  gas compared to the dark matter halo distribution is very uncertain . for the purpose of comparing our observations with the h i  clouds , we assume that h i  gas follows the dark matter distribution .",
    "we include in our comparison the prescription of @xcite , which includes a mass cutoff such that a dark matter halo with mass less than 2 @xmath1 10@xmath34 m@xmath35 has no associated h i  gas .",
    "we take as the scaling factor from dark matter to h i  gas mass the @xcite results , summarized in @xcite .",
    "their values yield a h i  to dark matter mass fraction of 0.0018 @xmath19 0.0003 .    after scaling the simulated dark matter to h i",
    ", the wmap3 simulation contains 7 dark matter halos with a simulated h i  mass between 10@xmath36 m@xmath6 , and the wmap5 simulation contains 8 .",
    "this is approximately consistent with the m81 h i  mass of 2.67 @xmath1 10@xmath37 m@xmath6 . for each of these major halos ,",
    "we extract a box corresponding to the 8@xmath0 @xmath1 8@xmath0 region centered on m81 .",
    "we then apply the 5@xmath4 h i  mass threshold and velocity limits of our survey .    for each major halo , we find the properties of sub - halos that would be detectable as h i  clouds in our observations .",
    "we repeat this process rotating the cube three ways .",
    "the difference between the expected and observed number of clouds is striking . in the simulation , we find an average of 41 clouds for the wmap3 simulation and 50 clouds for the wmap5 simulation ( ranging from 12 - 135 and 16 - 162 clouds , respectively ) per major halo with sufficient mass to be detected in our observations .",
    "recall that 9 clouds were detected in the corresponding region of our observations .",
    "we compare the positions and velocities of the detected clouds with the dark matter halos identified in the simulation , using a 2-dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "figure [ 2dhistfig ] is a 2-dimensional phase - space diagram showing the distribution of positions and velocities of all observed h i  clouds , along with all detectable subhalos , around each major halo , including all rotations , in the simulation .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the h i  clouds do not fall in the same region as the simulations ; the h i  clouds are much more concentrated around the central galaxy in both position and velocity than the dark - matter halos .",
    "the results of the 2-dimensional ks - test bear this out , giving an average probability of 8.0 @xmath38 for wmap3 and 7.0 @xmath38 for wmap5 ( across all rotations of all major halos ) that the position - velocity distributions are consistent .",
    "we observed a wide area of the nearby m81 filament in an attempt to find h i  clouds tracing dark matter minihalos predicted by @xmath7cdm cosmological simulations .",
    "we detected 5 new h i  clouds , bringing the total to 13 h i  clouds in the m81 filament including our previously published observations .",
    "of the 13 clouds detected in the observed region , 4 are likely to be part of the milky way hvc system .",
    "we compared the properties of the remaining 9 h i  clouds to two cosmological dark matter n - body simulations .",
    "we find that there are far fewer h i  clouds than simulations predict , and that the phase space distribution of the detected h i  clouds does not match that of the simulated clouds .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this discrepancy , both of which may be true .",
    "first , the h i  to dark matter mass fraction in minihalos may be less than 0.18@xmath38 .",
    "secondly , the phase space distribution of dark matter minihalos predicted by @xmath7cdm cosmological simulations may be incorrect .    because our simulations are dark - matter only , none of the simulated clouds are tidal debris ( which would contain no dark matter ) . with these simulations",
    ", we can not predict the properties of h i  clouds representative of tidal debris , but we can confidently say that the clouds we have detected do not match the properties expected for dark - matter minihalos .",
    "the detected h i  clouds are also not compatible with cold accretion , since we do not detect clouds near non - interacting galaxies  cold accretion clouds should be detectable regardless of interactions .",
    "in fact , recent research suggests that cold accretion clouds should be _ more _ prevalent in non - interacting groups , due to the lack of mitigating environmental effects @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the h i  clouds we have detected are not likely to be tracers of the predicted dark - matter minihalos in the m81 filament . instead , they are most likely generated through galaxy interactions . in order to understand the detailed role of galaxy interactions in generating h i  clouds ,",
    "further simulations including gas physics and deeper observations of more filaments are needed .",
    "this study allows us to constrain the number of detected h i  clouds that may be self - gravitating . in a study of gravitationally bound molecular clouds",
    ", @xcite found a strong correlation between velocity dispersion and cloud size , given by    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the diameter of the cloud .",
    "our survey detection threshold of @xmath41 = 10 km s@xmath2 gives a cloud size of 330 pc , so the angular resolution of our observations ( 10 kpc ) is the limiting factor in detecting self - gravitating h i  clouds .",
    "all of our clouds are unresolved in the gbt beam .",
    "our angular resolution limit gives a velocity dispersion of 36 km s@xmath2 , so for any of the detected clouds to be self - gravitating they must have a velocity dispersion less than or equal to this value .",
    "only two of the 9 clouds that we have determined to reside in the m81 group satisfy this constraint .",
    "the implication of this constraint is that most interaction - generated h i  clouds in our detection space are not self - gravitating .    on a side note ,",
    "dark - matter filaments such as the m81 filament are predicted to have diffuse h i  emission @xcite .",
    "the emission is predicted to be approximately 3 times fainter than our survey .",
    "our observations do , however , place an upper limit on diffuse h i  emission from the cosmic web .",
    "to estimate this , we determined our column density sensitivity using :    @xmath42    the average 5@xmath4 detection threshold for h i  column density was 4.4 @xmath1 10@xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "this column density falls within the  h i  desert \" , where the gas in the cosmic web is not affected by self - shielding and is therefore photoionized @xcite .",
    "hence , we did not expect to detect diffuse h i  in the filament between the two galaxy groups .",
    "our lowest 5@xmath4 detection threshold for h i  column density was @xmath15 1 @xmath1 10@xmath43 @xmath44 , which is approximately 3 times too high to detect the diffuse cosmic web in h i  emission .",
    "more sensitive gbt and evla observations of smaller regions , or surveys by future radio telescopes , could reach the sensitivity required to detect this emission .",

    "our survey encompasses a large volume and we have detected a significant number of galaxies in h i  .",
    "we calculated h i  masses of all known galaxies in the observed volume using :        distances for galaxies in the m81 filament were taken from @xcite . distances to background galaxies were taken from ned where available ; otherwise , they were calculated from the radial velocity , assuming a hubble constant of h@xmath46 = 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 . because of the high number of galaxies and continuum sources in the field , each galaxy spectrum was re - baselined using a first - order fit to the surrounding spectral region , in order to calculate an accurate h i  mass .",
