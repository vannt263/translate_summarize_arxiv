    "solar models constructed with recently determined heavy element abundances ( asplund et al . 2005 ; see also lodders 2003 ) disagree by many times the quoted measuring errors with helioseismological determinations of solar properties ( bahcall et al .",
    "this disagreement has led to a number of attempts to reconcile the solar models and the helioseismological measurements .",
    "so far there has not been a successful resolution of this problem ( see , for example , bahcall & pinsonneault 2004 ; bahcall et al .",

    "2004 , basu & antia 2004 , bahcall et al .",
    "however , a recalculation and refinement by the opacity project ( op , badnell et al .",
    "2005 ) of the radiative opacity used in the solar models yielded values for the radiative opacity that were very close to the previously used values ( opal , iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , and therefore the revision is insufficient to explain the disagreement between solar modelling and helioseismology .",
    "of course , there could still be inadequacies in the calculation of the opacity in the region of interest that are common to both opal and op evaluations .",
    "it is also natural to ask if changing the theoretical diffusion rate from the standard estimates could remove the discrepancies .",
    "guzik et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have explored solar models with a variety of diffusion treatments and conclude that the required increases in diffusion rates are unphysically large ( for example , an order of magnitude increase compared to the 15% uncertainty estimated by thoul et al .",
    "1994 ) ( see also turcotte et al . 1998 ; delahaye & pinsonneault 2005 ; and seaton 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , none of the variations of the diffusion rates restored completely the good agreement between helioseismology and solar modelling that was obtained ( e.g. , bahcall et al .",
    "2005a ) with the previously - estimated ( higher ) heavy element abundances of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .",
    "we note that the excellent agreement between the helioseismological measurements and the solar model predictions made using the older grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) abundances could be an accident .",
    "there are many uncertainties in the treatment of the external layers of the star .",
    "the discrepancies between solar model predictions made with the newer asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) abundances and helioseismological measurements represent a stimulating challenge to make further improvements .",
    "could the discrepancies between helioseismology and solar modelling be due to errors in one ( or a few ) poorly measured element abundances ?",
    "antia & basu ( 2005 ) have constructed envelope models of the sun which incorporate the seismologically - determined profile of sound speeds and the seismologically - inferred abundance of hydrogen and depth of the convective zone .",
    "they constructed a series of envelope models in which they changed the abundance of certain elements in order to test the effect of the abundance changes on the helioseismologically determined density profile .",
    "antia & basu ( 2005 ) inferred that ( with op opacities ) an increase in the ne abundance by @xmath3 dex relative to the asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) preferred value yielded agreement with the density profile .",
    "thus they found that , with the assumptions made regarding the envelope model , an abundance of [ ne / h ] = 8.47 reconciled the disagreement between envelope models and helioseismology .",
    "moreover , antia and basu found that satisfactory agreement with the density profile could also be achieved by simultaneously increasing the c ,",
    "n , o , and fe abundances by 0.05 dex and the ne by 0.40 dex relative to the asplund et al . ( 2005 ) recommended values .    in this paper",
    ", we evolve a series of complete solar models , interior plus atmosphere , to test the effects of abundance changes upon the full set of helioseismologically determined parameters : sound speed profile , depth of the convective zone , surface helium abundance , and density profile .",
    "the complete solar models have three advantages over envelope models : 1 ) the complete models incorporate solar evolution and a full description of the solar interior ; 2 ) the complete models can be tested against all of the helioseismologically determined parameters , not just the density profile ; and 3 ) the complete models can be used to determine how a given composition affects the calculated solar neutrino fluxes .    like antia and basu",
    ", we consider that the neon abundance could possibly change by much more than the quoted uncertainty , 0.06 dex ( asplund et al .",
    "the reason is that neon can not be measured spectroscopically in the solar photosphere and must be determined in regions in which the physical conditions are less well understood ( see , e.g. , the discussion in lodders 2003 ) . for exactly the same reason ,",
    "we consider that the argon abundance could possibly change by much more than the quoted uncertainty , 0.08 dex . in addition",
    ", it should be noted that the contribution of neon to the radiative opacity in the solar radiative interior is very important in the range of temperatures between @xmath4  k , precisely in the region the opacity needs to be increased in order to solve the discrepancy between solar model predictions and helioseismology ( bahcall et al .",

    "the top right panel shows that adding neon is not a panacea .",
    "the panel establishes this result with the aid of two solar models from table  [ tab : models ] , model  12 ( + 0.6 dex of neon respect to asplund et al . 2005 ) and 13 ( + 0.3 dex of neon with respect to asplund et al . 2005 ) .",

    "the antia - basu envelope models could only be tested against the density profile since their models had by construction the correct sound speed profile .",
    "however , the predicted sound speed profile of model  12 is much worse than for bs05(op)and figure  [ fig : inversion ] shows that the sound speed profile is unacceptable .",
    "the principal reason that the profile of the sound speed is unacceptable while the density profile is acceptable is that the sound speed is measured much more accurately than the density .",
    "we note that the successful composition changes are essentially a way of increasing the opacity in the region in which the model predictions differ from the measured helioseismological properties .",
