    "since the `` finding '' of the universal profile by navarro , frenk , and white ( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) , the structure of dark matter halos formed through dissipationless hierarchical clustering from cosmological initial setting has been explored by many researchers .",
    "nfw performed a number of @xmath3-body simulations of the halo formation using 10 - 20k particles and found that the profile of dark matter halo could be fitted to a simple formula ( hereafter , nfw profile ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a characteristic density and @xmath6 is a scale radius .",
    "they also argued that the profile has the same shape , independent of the halo mass , the power spectrum of the initial density fluctuation or other cosmological parameters .",
    "several groups reported the results of similar simulations with much higher resolutions .",
    "however , disagreement concerning the inner structure still remains .",
    "some researchers claimed that the slope of the inner cusp is steeper than that in the nfw s results .",
    "fukushige and makino ( 1997 ) performed a similar simulation with 768k particles and found that the galaxy - sized halo has a cusp steeper than @xmath7 .",
    "moore et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 hereafter m99 ) and ghigna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) performed simulations with up to 4 m particles and obtained the results that the profile has a cusp proportional to @xmath8 both in galaxy - sized and cluster - sized halos .",
    "m99 proposed the modified universal profile ( hereafter , m99 profile ) , @xmath9}.   \\label{eqm99}\\ ] ] fukushige and makino ( 2001 , paper i ; 2003 , paper ii ) performed two series of @xmath3-body simulations , and found that the halos have density cusps proportional to @xmath8 , independent of the halo mass and cosmological models .    on the other hands",
    ", other researchers obtained the slope of inner cusp shallower than @xmath2 and close to that in the nfw profile .",
    "jing and suto ( 2000 , 2002 ) performed a series of @xmath3-body simulations and concluded that the power of the cusp depends on mass .",
    "it varies from @xmath2 for galaxy mass halo to @xmath10 for cluster mass halo .",
    "klypin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) obtained the slope at the center that could be approximated by @xmath8 .",
    "they , however , argued that the nfw fit is still good up to their resolution limit .",
    "power et al .",
    "( 2003 ) simulated an lcdm galaxy - sized halo with 3 m particles and claimed that their circular velocity profile obtained is in better agreement with the nfw profile than with the m99 profile .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the inner structure of the dark matter halo by means of @xmath3-body simulations with about 10 times higher mass resolution than that of previous simulations .",
    "we simulated the formation of 8 cluster - sized halos in the scdm and lcdm models using parallel barnes - hut treecode on parallel grape cluster .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the model of our @xmath3-body simulation . in section 3",
    ", we present the results of simulation .",
    "section 4 is for conclusion and discussion .",
    "we consider two cosmological models , scdm model ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and lcdm model ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the density parameter , @xmath19 is the dimensionless cosmological constant , and @xmath20 at the present epoch .",
    "the amplitudes of the power spectrum in cdm models are normalized using the top - hat filtered mass variance at @xmath21 mpc according to the cluster abundance ( kitayama & suto 1997 ) .",
    "we simulate the formation of the dark matter halos using the `` re - simulation '' method , which has been a standard method for the simulation of halo formation since nfw ( 1996 ) . the procedure for setting the initial condition of halos",
    "are the same as that used in paper ii .",
    "we first performed large scale cosmological simulations with @xmath22 particles in a sphere of 300@xmath23mpc comoving radius .",
    "we regard spherical overdensity regions around local potential minima within @xmath24 as candidate halos .",
    "we define the radius @xmath24 such that the spherical overdensity inside is 178@xmath25 times the critical density for scdm and 178@xmath26 times for lcdm model ( eke , cole , frenk 1998 ) .",
    "we selected 8 halos from the catalog of candidate halos .",
    "the selected halos are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we selected the three most massive halos and one halo randomly from halo candidates lying within 200@xmath23mpc from the center in both models ( so that the external tidal field can be included ) .",
    "we express a region within @xmath27 from the center of the halo at @xmath28 in the cosmological simulation with larger number of particles .",
    "we place particles whose mass is as same as that in the cosmological simulation in a sphere of @xmath29 100@xmath23mpc comoving radius surrounding the high resolution region , in order to express the external tidal field .",
    "the total number of particles , @xmath3 , is listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the generation of initial density fluctuation were done on hitachi sr8000 ( 1 node ) in information technology center , university of tokyo using cosmics2 package ( bertschinger 2001 ) .    .run",
    "properties[tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at the inner region ( @xmath30 mpc ) , we can see the density keeps almost unchanged from relatively higher redshift for all runs .",
    "this fact also can be seen in the evolution of the cumulative mass shown in figure [ fignevtb ] .",
    "this means that the density at the inner region is determined by that of the smaller halo that collapsed at higher redshift .",
    "the density profile of the outer region is formed as the halo grows and shows universality .",
    "moreover , the agreement with the m99 profile at higher redshift is very well down to the radius at which the cusp shallowing can be seen at @xmath28 , independent of the cosmological model we simulated in this paper .",
    "figure [ figr0 ] shows the relation between the scale radius @xmath31 and density @xmath32 obtained by the fitting .",
    "we can see clearly an evolutionary pass along a line , @xmath33 , also independent of the cosmological model .      in section [ secm99 ]",
    ", we see that the agreement with the m99 profile is not good at the inner region ( @xmath34mpc ) , and also that with the nfw profile is worse in the whole range of profile in section [ secnfw ] .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to fit the results to other profiles . here , we try to fit the results to two different profiles .",
    "firstly , we fit the results to a profile that has an inner cusp shallower than that of the m99 profile and steeper than the nfw profile [ fitting ( 1 ) ] , given as @xmath35 } \\label{eqprof1}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the power of the inner cusp and we set @xmath37 . in figure",
    "[ figfits ] , we fit the density profiles to the profile given by equation ( [ eqprof1 ] ) .",
    "the fitting here was done using @xmath38 and the least square fit of @xmath39 for @xmath40 mpc ( down to the reliability limit ) .",
    "the scale radii @xmath41 obtained by the fitting are summarized in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "figure [ figresnew ] shows the residual @xmath42 . the agreement is better than both the m99 and nfw profiles .",
    "we also tried to add another power law region ( @xmath43 ) to the m99 profile [ fitting ( 2 ) ] , given as @xmath44^{1.5-\\beta } \\left[1+(r / r_{\\rm 0})^{1.5}\\right ] } \\label{eqprof2}\\ ] ] where @xmath45^{1.5-\\beta},\\ ] ] @xmath46 is another scale radius .",
    "although this profile includes more parameters to fit , it is based on the observation that two different mechanisms might be working in the growth of the halo as suggested by the analyses in section [ secev ] .    in figure",
    "[ figfits ] , we fit the density profiles to the profile given by equation ( [ eqprof2 ] ) . here , for simplicity , we set @xmath47 for all runs and , therefore , the equation ( [ eqprof2 ] ) becomes @xmath48^{1.5 } \\left[1+(r / r_{\\rm 0})^{1.5}\\right ] } \\label{eqnew}\\ ] ] where @xmath49^{1.5}\\ ] ] the fitting here was done using @xmath6 obtained in the fitting to the m99 profile and the least square fit of @xmath50 at @xmath40 mpc .",
    "the scale radii @xmath46 obtained are summarized in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "figure [ figresnew ] shows the residual , @xmath51 . as a matter of course , agreement is better than that for any other profile , since we increased the number of fitting parameters .",
    "unfortunately , in the present simulations , the region that we can use to determine which fitting formula is more appropriate is not so large .",
    "further studies with simulations with higher resolution and larger number of samples would be necessary .",
    "we performed @xmath3-body simulations of dark matter halo formation in scdm and lcdm models .",
    "we simulated 8 halos whose mass range is @xmath0 to @xmath1 using up to 30 millions particles .",
    "* we found that , in all runs , the slope of inner cusp within @xmath52 is shallower than @xmath2 , and the radius where the shallowing starts exhibits run - to - run variation , which means the profile is not universal .",
    "* we found that the profile is in agreement with the m99 profile for @xmath53 , and are not in agreement with the nfw profile .",
    "we present different fitting formulae to describe the whole range of the simulation results .",
    "although we found interesting features in the inner structure of dark matter halo by new simulations with much higher resolution , we could not achieve the final understanding of the structure .",
    "one question remained is whether the cdm halo has a flat core or not .",
    "another question is whether the same shallowing can be seen in the halo of galaxy or dwarf galaxy size .",
    "the origin of the inner structure is also still unclear . in order to answer these questions",
