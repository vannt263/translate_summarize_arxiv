    "light quark masses are important unknown parameters of the standard model , and a number of lattice qcd calculations have been carried out to evaluate quark masses employing the wilson , clover or kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermion action  @xcite . among the results ,",
    "those with the ks action appear more accurate than others because of small lattice discretization errors and small statistical errors .    a worry with the ks result",
    ", however , has been that the employed one - loop renormalization factor takes a large value of @xmath8 in the range of @xmath9 studied , calling into question the viability of perturbation theory . in this article",
    "we report a study to circumvent this problem : we calculate the renormalization factor of bilinear quark operators for the ks action non - perturbatively using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite developed for the wilson / clover actions .",
    "this calculation is carried out in quenched qcd at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 on an @xmath10 lattice .",
    "the results , combined with our previous calculation of bare quark masses  @xcite , lead to a non - perturbative determination of the light quark mass .",
    "the renormalization factor of a bilinear operator @xmath11 is obtained from the amputated green function , @xmath12 where the quark two - point function is defined by @xmath13 .",
    "the quark field @xmath14 with momentum @xmath15 is defined from the original one - component field @xmath16 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 $ ] .    the renormalization condition imposed on @xmath22",
    "is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the amputated green function at tree level and @xmath25 is the wave function renormalization factor which can be calculated by the condition @xmath26 for the conserved vector current .",
    "the relation between the bare operator on the lattice and the renormalized operator in the continuum takes the form , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the renormalization - group running factor , and @xmath29 is the matching factor from the @xmath30 scheme defined by ( [ eq : ri ] ) to the @xmath31 scheme , calculated perturbatively in the continuum .",
    "for the light quark mass we apply relation ( [ zzz ] ) in the scalar channel in the chiral limit .",
    "we use a source in momentum eigenstate to evaluate quark propagators .",
    "this results in very small statistical errors of @xmath32 in the green functions .",
    "the external momentum @xmath15 should be taken in the range @xmath33 in order to keep under control higher order effects in continuum perturbation theory , non - perturbative hadronization effect on the lattice , and discretization errors on the lattice . in this work",
    "we choose @xmath34 momenta in the range @xmath35 for all values of @xmath9 .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] we compare the scalar renormalization factor @xmath36 with that for pseudoscalar @xmath37 for three values of bare quark mass @xmath38 at @xmath0 . from chiral symmetry of ks fermions",
    ", we expect naively @xmath39 for all momenta @xmath15 in the chiral limit",
    ". clearly this relation does not hold with our result toward small momenta , where @xmath37 rapidly increases as @xmath40 , while @xmath41 does not show such a trend .    to understand this result",
    ", we note that chiral symmetry of ks fermion leads to the following identities : @xmath42 with @xmath43 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] @xmath44 in the chiral limit obtained by a linear extrapolation in @xmath45 is plotted .",
    "it rapidly dumps for large momenta , but takes large values in the small momentum region .",
    "combined with ( [ zp ] ) this implies that @xmath37 diverges in the chiral limit for small momenta , which is consistent with the result in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the function @xmath44 is related to chiral condensate as follows : @xmath46      = \\sum_p \\frac { m(p ) } { c_\\mu(p)^2 + m(p)^2 } \\ ] ] where @xmath47/ \\cos(p_\\mu a)$ ] .",
    "a non - vanishing value of @xmath44 for small momenta would lead to a non - zero value of the condensate .",
    "therefore the divergence of @xmath48 near the chiral limit is a manifestation of spontaneous symmetry breakdown of chiral symmetry ; it is a non - perturbative effect arising from the presence of massless goldstone boson .",
    "we expect this non - perturbative effect to affect the scalar renormalization factor @xmath41 much less , since the scalar operator can not interact directly with the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "indeed the quark mass dependence is quite small as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .      in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the momentum dependence of the ratio @xmath49 calculated in the chiral limit where we set @xmath50 and use the three - loop formula  @xcite for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "while the ratio should be independent of the quark momentum @xmath15 , our results show a large momentum dependence which is almost linear in @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "a natural origin of the linear dependence on @xmath53 is the lattice discretization error of the scalar operator , which differs by terms of @xmath55 from that of the continuum for the ks fermion .",
    "we then remove this error from the renormalization factor by a linear extrapolation in @xmath53 to @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the fitting lines are plotted , where filled data points are used for the linear extrapolation . for comparison ,",
    "the ratio calculated with the one - loop value equals @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath5 .",
    "hence one - loop perturbation theory underestimates the ratio by @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "our final results for the averaged up and down quark mass at @xmath50 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] by filled symbols .",
    "here we use the jlqcd results for bare quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the values are substantially larger than those obtained with one - loop perturbation theory ( open circles for @xmath5 and squares for @xmath7 ) .",
    "furthermore they exhibit a significant @xmath62 dependence , which we ascribe to the discretization error of the quark mass itself . making a linear extrapolation in @xmath62 , our final result in the continuum limit",
    "is given by @xmath63 this value is @xmath61 larger than the perturbative estimates : @xmath64 for @xmath5 and @xmath65 for @xmath7 .",
