    "vortex motion is highly sensitive to thermal fluctuations and nonlinear interactions between vortices and other excitations in the fluid  @xcite , and many experiments depend on the presence  @xcite or formation  @xcite of a rotating thermal reservoir to take the superfluid from a non - rotating state to one containing vortices . in an annular trapping geometry , such as may be created using an obstacle potential in a harmonic trap  @xcite , a vortex can be pinned to the obstacle to create a bec in a state of perpetual motion , forming a _ persistent current _  @xcite . in the absence of coherent optical manipulation  @xcite , the dynamical evolution from a non - rotating ground state to one containing a topologically stabilized superflow",

    "we present a study of persistent current formation via dissipative vortex dynamics in the presence of a large , high - temperature thermal reservoir .",
    "while dissipative vortex dynamics in harmonically trapped becs have been treated numerically  @xcite , the predictions for vortex lifetimes have not yet been tested experimentally .",
    "here we perform large - scale numerical simulations of an experimental forcing sequence that generates a long - lived persistent current via forcing and thermal dissipation  @xcite . to describe the conditions of the experiment we use the stochastic projected gross - pitaevskii equation ( spgpe )  @xcite for the dynamical evolution of a system of partially coherent matter waves in contact with a thermal reservoir of high - energy , incoherent atoms .",
    "we compare the spgpe and damped gpe ( dgpe )  @xcite ( obtained by neglecting the noise in the spgpe ) with experimental observations of the formation of a persistent current .",
    "our results provide an _ ab initio _ quantitative experimental test of the spgpe , and indicate the need for both damping and noise terms to give a quantitative account of vortex motion in a high - temperature bose - einstein condensate .",
    "as highly controllable degenerate matter wave systems , dilute bose gases offer a unique window into the realm of many body quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "yet developing a quantitative non - equilibrium description of high - temperature bose gases poses a major theoretical challenge  @xcite , particularly near the critical temperature where the breakdown of mean - field theory renders two - fluid theories  @xcite inoperative .",

    "the equation of motion resembles the projected gross - pitaevskii equation ( pgpe )  @xcite , but also contains damping and noise terms arising from the reservoir interaction , and evolves both the condensed and non - condensed fractions of the bose field lying below a specified energy cutoff .",
    "the cutoff is a central formal and technical aspect of the theory , allowing its consistent extension beyond one spatial dimension  @xcite ( note also the non - projected sgpe of refs .",

    "we use the _ simple - growth _ spgpe  @xcite , a treatment that provides a description of a reservoir with definite temperature and atom number , but neglects reservoir interactions involving number - conserving scattering between the classical field and thermal reservoir atoms @xcite .",
    "these processes induce energy damping and diffusion , and are known to be weak in quasi - equilibrium situations @xcite . in a simple - growth spgpe study of vortices occurring spontaneously during the phase - transition  @xcite , a single fitted parameter ( the reservoir coupling strength ) was used to give vortex formation data in close agreement with the experiment . however , in near - equilibrium situations the reservoir interaction parameters can be determined _ a - priori _",

    "we choose two values of @xmath41 at the upper and lower values of the experimental uncertainty in the measured value respectively .",
    "we then create an initial equilibrium state by evolving eq .",
    "( [ sgpesimp ] ) with the gaussian potential at @xmath43 , and verify its properties .",
    "our parameter sets are :    \\(a ) @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ,    \\(b ) @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "these self - consistently determined parameters allow us to sample the equilibrium ensemble of the spgpe , for a total of @xmath50 @xmath51 atoms in the toroidal trapping potential at temperature @xmath52  , matching the experimental values for atom number and temperature .",
    "to model the dynamics , the gaussian obstacle is shifted to @xmath53 , moving it in a circle of radius @xmath54 , about the point @xmath55 , with angular frequency @xmath56 ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) , as is done in the experiment .",
    "after one circular orbit , the potential is held at the trap center . using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dampingrate ] ) , both parameter sets ( a ) and ( b ) give @xmath57 , setting the dissipation rate during the dynamics . for each parameter",
    "set we propagate 16 trajectories of the spgpe .",
    "our implementation of the damped gpe is identical to that of the spgpe , except that the noise is set to zero in eq .",
    "( [ sgpesimp ] ) .",
    "we quantitatively compare the spgpe and dgpe by calculating the number of vortices at a given time in the numerical simulations , and comparing this with the number found in the experiment .",
    "experimentally , the vortices were counted from time - of - flight images after ramping down the gaussian beam over 250 ms .",
    "the experimental data are analyzed differently for the time interval immediately after the stir ( @xmath58s ) , and for later times where the average number of vortices reaches a quasi - equilibrium state ; we refer to the latter interval as _ equilibrium _ , but it should be noted that even at the longest observation times of the experiment there remains a small rate of free vortex observation , and a slow decline of the mean observed winding number , and hence true equilibrium does not occur",
    ". however , the mean total number of vortices reaches equilibrium in our simulations , and quasi - equilibrium in the experiment , after @xmath59s .",
    "after this equilibrium is achieved , the winding number of the persistent current is experimentally determined by introducing an extra 3 s hold after ramping down the obstacle .",
    "this allows multiply charged vortices that are no longer stabilized by the obstacle beam to break up into individual vortices of unit circulation @xcite , that are readily observed . for the short - time data ( @xmath58 s ) , we use a different technique .",
    "we again count free vortices , but do so immediately after ramping down the obstacle . without the hold time , multiple vortices simultaneously pinned to the obstacle do not decay into individual vortex cores . instead , the density minimum at the center of the flow that formed the multiply charged core acquires a new area that depends on the winding number . as recently shown , the area of the density minimum at the core is proportional to the winding number  @xcite ; we use this relationship to infer the pinned winding number prior to obstacle ramp - down .",
    "the observed vortex number thus includes free vortices and any vortices pinned to the gaussian beam prior to the imaging sequence .    in our simulations",
    "we extract the total vorticity to be compared with the experimental data via @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number free of vortices ( of both positive and negative circulation ) in the region of detection , and the @xmath62 is the inner boundary of the toroidal atomic density , so that the winding number from pinned vortices is @xmath63 . in equilibrium , @xmath64 corresponds to the size of the stable persistent current . to avoid",
    "counting thermal fluctuations as vortices , we limit our region of vortex detection to radii of significant atomic density ( after the stir , this is the region @xmath65 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figsequence ] by blue dashed circles ) , consistent with the limitations of experimental vortex detection .    during the post - stir hold period [ fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ( e ) ] , there is an additional cooling stage of the experiment , however this has a negligible effect on the vortex dynamics of the simulations . a discussion of this and other technical features of our simulations and experiment is given in section [ disc ] .",
    "fig .  [ figsequence ] shows a comparison of individual trajectories of the spgpe and dgpe for parameter set ( a ) .",
    "the dynamics of both methods are qualitatively similar .",
    "multiple vortices are nucleated during the stirring procedure , and then decay through a range of processes : decay to the exterior condensate boundary , internal vortex - antivortex annihilation , or via pinning at the central potential   for movie s1 showing a single spgpe trajectory . ] .",
    "finally the system evolves into a stable persistent current of winding number @xmath66 , with no free vortices in the bulk fluid .",
    "the timescale of the decay of free vortices in spgpe and dgpe differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "the spgpe evolution generates a stable @xmath67 persistent current after 2.8  s. in contrast , the dgpe requires over 25  s to evolve into a stable persistent current with @xmath68 .    in fig .",
    "[ figvortexnumber ] we plot @xmath69 for the spgpe ensemble average , and for the dgpe simulations .",
    "we first show the long - time data in the main plot of fig .",
    "[ figvortexnumber ] , which includes data for the experiment near equilibrium where a stable persistent current has formed .",
    "the timescale of equilibration , i.e. the average time at which @xmath70 , is shown for the spgpe @xmath71 and dgpe @xmath72 .",
    "both spgpe calculations agree well with the first experimental data point at @xmath73  s , lying within the experimental uncertainty . at this stage",
    "@xmath69 has reached a stable value for the spgpe simulations and all free vortices have left the condensate , leaving a persistent current .",
    "the spgpe calculations agree well with the experiment for @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast , free vortices exist in the dgpe simulations for the first 25  s of evolution with @xmath75 for both parameter sets .",
    "eventually the dgpe evolves into equilibrium with @xmath68 for ( a ) , and @xmath76 for ( b ) , differing from the experimental observations , and indicating a high sensitivity to the precise value of @xmath41 used .",
    "note that the long time decay of the experimental value of @xmath69 is possibly due to a slow drift in the magnetic trap center , rather than the decay of free vortices  @xcite .",
    "the short - time dynamics ( during the stir ) are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figvortexnumber ] , where we compare the numerical results with experimental data .",
    "the early time dynamics show a rapid initial rise in @xmath69 as angular momentum is injected by the stir , with more vortices nucleated in the spgpe simulations .",
    "the peak number of vortices occurs at @xmath77  s in both spgpe ensemble averages , after which there is a dramatic drop in @xmath78 . in comparison ,",
    "the dgpe vortex number peaks at @xmath79  s , followed by a very slow decline . in general ,",
    "the spgpe results agree well with experiment for both parameter sets ( a ) and ( b ) , while the dgpe shows a slower decay for @xmath69 , and a strong dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "while the dgpe describes the dynamics qualitatively , the the timescale of stable persistent current formation is a factor of 10 slower than observed in spgpe , and at least a factor of 3 slower than observed in the experiment .",
    "these quantitative differences are our main result : the discrepancies in the dgpe signify a breakdown of the dgpe validity , which in combination with the accuracy of the spgpe show that the noise is necessary to _ quantitatively _ reproduce the available experimental data , in both the non - equilibrium and equilibrium stages of the evolution .    in fig .",
    "[ figvortexnumber ] we see that the main effect of varying @xmath41 is to change the size of persistent current formed . within the dgpe a larger barrier height leads to a smaller persistent current , @xmath76 , much smaller than the experimentally observed value of @xmath80 .",
    "in contrast to the dgpe , in spgpe a larger barrier leads to a _ larger _ persistent current ; this suggests that fluctuations enhance vortex mobility near the barrier .",
    "in this section we discuss the consistency of our simulations , and aspects of vortex imaging , the cooling sequence , and the role of experimental uncertainties .",
    "our numerical method is a spectral galerkin method based on gauss - hermite quadrature @xcite . due to large particle number , the trap oblateness , and the need for a high energy cutoff , we require @xmath81 modes in the @xmath9-region , making each trajectory numerically challenging   days of wall clock time to propagate for @xmath82 s of system evolution , on the university of otago vulcan computing cluster with 2.66 ghz cpus . ] .",
    "however our method is advantageous since our choice of basis allows us to precisely implement a consistent energy cutoff for this system in the single - particle basis , since at sufficiently high energies the many - body hamiltonian is diagonalized by this basis .",
    "since the spgpe is a formally projected theory , the cutoff independence should be verified before make quantitative predictions . for our system",
    ", the chosen cutoff energy @xmath14 gives an average occupation at the cutoff of @xmath83 .",
    "cutoff independence was checked by performing simulations with @xmath14 lowered by 12% .",
    "this resulted in a similar mean cutoff occupation of @xmath84 , and no discernible differences in the dissipative evolution of spgpe simulations .",
    "note also that the gaussian potential is well represented in the basis of single - particle states defining the * c*-rgeion due to a separation of energy and length scales : @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "thus our basis gives a complete representation of the @xmath9-region field in the combined trap .",
    "there are two simplifications of our spgpe treatment that require further discussion .",
    "firstly , we have neglected the dynamics of the atoms in the * i*-region . in general",
    "this can be a significant effect @xcite , but in the system we consider the thermal fraction is very large ( @xmath87 ) , justifying the approximation that the effect of the condensate on the thermal cloud is negligible . from a technical standpoint , a theoretical framework that encompasses",
    "spgpe dynamics for the * c*-region and includes dynamics of the * i*-region is yet to be developed .",
    "secondly , we have neglected the so - called _ scattering _ terms  @xcite , involving the number - conserving exchange of energy between * c*- and * i*-regions .",
    "such terms are significant when the * c*- and * i*-regions are far from mutual equilibrium , so it is possible that these terms have a significant effect during the stir .",
    "however we see that the simple growth model accurately reproduces the available experimental data during the short time evolution .",
    "the accuracy of our spgpe simulations is because the system rapidly evolves into quasi - equilibrium [ see fig .  [ figsequence]-[figvortexnumber ] ] , ensuring the validity of the simple growth model .",
    "vortex imaging involves ramping down the obstacle potential , introducing the possibility that vortices initially pinned to the barrier could decay prior to imaging . simulations of this ramp down show the vortex number is preserved , as can be expected on physical grounds since the vortex decay time is much longer than the ramp time .",
    "the time - of - flight imaging also does not change the vortex number , as it occurs after the trap potential is snapped off , causing ballistic expansion of the cloud and rapid extinguishing of any further mean - field dynamics .",
    "preservation of vortex number during imaging has also been verified in experiments with identical expansion parameters performed in ref .",
    "@xcite where vortex numbers consistent with known forcing were observed .      as discussed in section [ numerics ]",
    ", there is an additional cooling stage at the end of the experimental sequence that we do not present data for here .",
    "after @xmath88 s the system is cooled to @xmath89 , with @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "we have simulated this cooling by instantaneously changing reservoir parameters at @xmath88  s to @xmath91 , to give a reservoir atom number and temperature consistent with the end state of the experimental sequence . modeling this process revealed no significant modification to the spgpe value for @xmath92 , consistent with a quasi - equilibrium state associated with a stable winding number being reached before the cooling process begins .",
    "in addition to the main parameter we have considered ( @xmath41 ) , there is further experimental uncertainty in other parameters including atom number , temperature , stirring velocity , beam width , and beam position .",
    "numerical simulations with variations in these parameters would also lead to variations in the final persistent current size .",
    "however we expect that the most significant change will be due to including thermal driving noise in the spgpe , which significantly increases vortex decay rates  @xcite .",
    "thus the persistent current formation time in spgpe can be expected to be much faster than in dgpe , irrespective of these various experimental uncertainties .",
    "in this work we have modeled the persistent current experiment of neely _ et al . _ @xcite using a grand - canonical c - field theory of reservoir interactions .",
    "we have performed an _ ab initio _ quantitative test of the spgpe with no fitted parameters .",
    "the spgpe theory quantitatively reproduces the dynamics observed in the experiment at short times , and accurately predicts the experimentally observed persistent current formation time _ and _ winding number .",
    "while the damped gpe is qualitatively correct it is not quantitatively informative , as could be expected in the high - temperature regime of the experiment @xmath93 . in general , both damping and noise are required to give a quantitative description of dissipation in open quantum systems , and",
    "our results demonstrate the central importance of thermal noise in high - temperature bose - gas dynamics , with particular emphasis on the motion of quantized vortices .",
    "our approach provides a general quantitative framework for modelling the high - temperature dynamics of trapped bose - einstein condensates .",
