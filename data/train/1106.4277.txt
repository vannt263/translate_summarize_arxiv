    "medical imaging modalities aim to combine high resolution with high contrast between healthy and unhealthy tissues .",

    "the ultrasound modulation of electrical or optical properties of tissues and the combination of simultaneous electrical and magnetic resonance measurements both offer the possibility to combine high resolution with high contrast . for the acquisition of ultrasound - modulated measurements ,",
    "we refer the reader to , e.g. , @xcite for works in the mathematical literature . for the acquisition of internal information on electrical conductivities by magnetic resonance imaging ,",
    "we refer the reader to , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "mathematically , we aim to reconstruct a scalar diffusion coefficient @xmath8 in an elliptic equation from knowledge of internal information of the form @xmath11 for @xmath2 and @xmath12 , where @xmath3 and @xmath13 are solutions of the elliptic problem with different boundary conditions ; see and below .",
    "coupling impedance ( or diffusion ) with acoustic waves or magnetic resonance correspond to the cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "such information can be obtained from functionals of the form @xmath14 by standard polarization ( expressions of the form @xmath15 ) .",
    "this problem was first solved in the two dimensional setting in @xcite in the case @xmath16 and @xmath6 .",
    "the three dimensional setting was addressed in @xcite with @xmath17 and @xmath6 . in these papers ,",
    "the elliptic equation is recast as a system of equations for quantities of the form @xmath18 using the elliptic equation and the fact that @xmath19 is curl free .",
    "this strategy allows one to eliminate @xmath8 from the system of equations and solve for the vectors @xmath20 .",
    "the stable reconstruction of @xmath8 is then straightforward .",

    "it is shown in that paper that the stable reconstruction of @xmath8 may not be possible from such non - redundant measurements .",
    "this justifies the analysis of redundant measurements .",
    "the objectives of this paper are twofold .",
    "we first generalize the reconstruction of @xmath8 to the case of arbitrary space dimension @xmath23 and almost arbitrary @xmath2 . assuming that the vectors @xmath20 form a frame , we obtain a system of equations for the vectors @xmath20 that involves @xmath24 but no longer @xmath8",
    ". the resulting system of equations may be seen as an overdetermined nonlinear system of equations . by appropriately choosing the boundary conditions used to construct the internal functionals @xmath25 , we obtain a global uniqueness and stability result for the reconstruction of the scalar quantity @xmath0 .",
    "although several portions of the algorithm generalize to the reconstruction of anisotropic diffusion tensors , we restrict ourselves to the scalar case in this paper .",
    "we also describe and investigate the compatibility conditions associated with such a redundant system .",
    "the second objective of the paper is to present a system of elliptic equations for the solutions @xmath3 with constitutive parameters that depend on the measurements @xmath26 but not on the unknown diffusion coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the system is uniquely solvable when a fredholm alternative holds .",
    "we obtain existence and uniqueness results for the proposed system for all but a discrete number of values of the dimension @xmath23 and the coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "both algorithms require boundary conditions for the elliptic solutions that ensure that @xmath23 of the vectors @xmath20 form a frame in @xmath27 at each point of the domain of interest .",
    "whereas such a condition is easy to meet in two space dimensions , in dimensions three and higher , the only available technique that guarantees such an independence is based on using complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) solutions .",
    "we generalize here the cgo construction of @xcite to the multi - dimensional setting and for almost all values of @xmath10 .",
    "the inverse diffusion problems with internal functionals considered here are examples of hybrid inverse problem where two imaging modalities are combined to provide both high resolution and high contrast .",
    "for recent works on the mathematics of hybrid inverse problems and their many applications in medical imaging , we refer the reader to the articles in the book @xcite and to the recent review paper @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",

    "the redundant system of equations for the vectors @xmath20 is addressed in section [ sec : ode ] while the system of linear equations for the solutions @xmath3 is given in section [ sec : elliptic ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : comp ] presents further reconstruction algorithms in the two dimensional case and analyzes the compatibility conditions satisfied by the redundant data and their potential use .",

    "the case @xmath7 with @xmath21 related to mreit and cdii ( current density impedance imaging ) is addressed in @xcite .    following a similar approach to @xcite",
    ", we first perform the change of unknown functions @xmath35 for every @xmath36 and define @xmath37 we also equip @xmath38 with its euclidean metric @xmath39 in the canonical basis @xmath40 . for a given vector field @xmath41 defined on @xmath28 ,",

    ", we obtain the set of equations for @xmath310 @xmath565 ( @xmath566 are not being summed over but @xmath567 are ) .",
    "this is also a quadratic system of the form with different matrices @xmath562 .        * either give us compatibility conditions on the data ( that do not depend on the unknown frame ) , thus characterizing the range of the measurement operator , * or they may allow us to invert algebraically for the cosines and sines of the @xmath360 spherical angles that parameterize the @xmath338-valued @xmath121 frame .",
    "this in turn may come at the price of other compatibility conditions that only depend on the data .",
    "it remains an interesting , so far unresolved , question to find an algorithm that enforces the compatibility conditions as the system of odes is used to ensure that the reconstruction does not depend on the choice of integration paths .      the system of elliptic equations for the scalar solutions @xmath3 is well - posed for almost all values of @xmath10 and @xmath23 .",
    "once the solutions @xmath3 are obtained , it remains to solve the equation for @xmath568 .",
    "the only remaining compatibility condition is therefore that the latter term indeed be a gradient . in a similar manner to what we just saw for the ode - based method , writing the condition @xmath556 yields @xmath336 equations of the type @xmath569 where the matrices @xmath562 depend only on the data @xmath26 .",

    "<S> this paper concerns the reconstruction of a scalar diffusion coefficient @xmath0 from redundant functionals of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a solution of the elliptic problem @xmath4 for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath6 is used to model measurements obtained from modulating a domain of interest by ultrasound and finds applications in ultrasound modulated electrical impedance tomography ( umeit ) , ultrasound modulated optical tomography ( umot ) as well as impedance acoustic computerized tomography ( impact ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath7 finds applications in magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography ( mreit ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we present two explicit reconstruction procedures of @xmath8 for appropriate choices of @xmath9 and of traces of @xmath3 at the boundary of a domain of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the first procedure involves the solution of an over - determined system of ordinary differential equations and generalizes to the multi - dimensional case and to ( almost ) arbitrary values of @xmath10 the results obtained in two and three dimensions in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , in the case @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the second procedure consists of solving a system of linear elliptic equations , which we can prove admits a unique solution in specific situations .    </S>",
