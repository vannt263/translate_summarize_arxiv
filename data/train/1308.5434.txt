    "the capacity of wireless interference networks is a rapidly evolving research front , spurred in part by exciting breakthroughs such as the idea of interference alignment @xcite which provides fascinating theoretical insights and shows much promise under idealized conditions .",
    "the connection to practical settings however remains tenuous .",
    "this is in part due to the following two factors .",
    "first , because of the assumption of precise channel knowledge , idealized studies often get caught in the minutiae of channel realizations , e.g. , rational versus irrational values , that have little bearing in practice .",
    "second , by focusing on the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of fully connected networks , these studies ignore the most critical aspect of interference management in practice  the differences of signal strengths due to path loss and fading ( in short , network topology ) . indeed",
    ", the dof metric treats every channel as essentially equally strong ( capable of carrying exactly 1 dof ) .",
    "so the desired signal has to actively avoid _ every _ interferer , whereas in practice each user needs to avoid only a few significant interferers and the rest are weak enough to be safely ignored .",
    "therefore , by trivializing the topology of the network , the dof studies of fully connected networks make the problem much harder than it needs to be .",
    "non - trivial solutions to this harder problem invariably rely on much more channel knowledge than is available in practice .",
    "thus , the two limiting factors re - enforce each other .    evidently , in order to avoid these pitfalls , one should shift focus away from optimal ways of exploiting precise channel knowledge ( which is rarely available ) , and toward optimal ways of exploiting a coarse knowledge of interference network _",
    "topology_. this line of thought motivates robust models of interference networks where only a coarse knowledge of channel strength levels is available to the transmitters and no channel phase knowledge is assumed .",
    "this is the _ multilevel _ topological interference management framework .",
    "it is a generalization of the elementary topological interference management framework introduced in @xcite , wherein the transmitters can only distinguish between channels that are connected ( strong ) and not connected ( weak ) .",
    "existing wireless interference networks are based on two robust interference management principles  1 ) _ ignore _ interference that is sufficiently weak , and 2 ) _ avoid _ interference that is not . in slightly more technical terms",
    ", ignoring interference translates into treating it as noise , and avoiding interference translates into access schemes such as tdma / fdma / cdma .",
    "the intuitive appeal of these principles lies in their robustness , and in particular , their minimal channel knowledge requirements .",
    "recent work has explored the optimality of both of these principles .    1 .   _ tin : _ the optimality of the first principle , _ treating interference as noise _ ( tin ) when it is sufficiently weak , has received much attention @xcite .",
    "most recently , in @xcite , geng et al . show that in a general @xmath0 user gaussian interference channel setting , if for each user the desired signal strength is no less than the sum of the strengths of the strongest interference _ from _ this user and the strongest interference _ to _ this user ( all values in db scale ) , then tin is the optimal scheme for the entire capacity region of this network , up to a constant gap of no more than @xmath1 bits . 2 .",
    "_ tim : _ the optimality of the second principle , _ avoidance _ , has been investigated most recently by @xcite , as the _ topological interference management _ ( tim ) problem . with channel knowledge at the transmitters limited to a coarse knowledge of network topology ( which links are stronger / weaker than the effective noise floor )",
    ", tim is shown in @xcite to be essentially an index coding problem @xcite .",
    "tim subsumes within itself the tdma / fdma / cdma schemes as trivial special cases , but is in general much more capable than these conventional approaches .",
    "the two principles  avoiding versus ignoring interference  which are mapped to tim and tin , respectively , naturally correspond to interference management in terms of signal _ vector spaces _ and signal _ power levels_. tim uses the interference alignment perspective @xcite to optimally allocate signal vector subspaces among the interferers .",
    "note that in order to resolve desired signal from interference based on the signal vector spaces , the strength of each signal is irrelevant .",
    "what matters is only that desired signal and the interference occupy linearly independent spaces .",
    "tin , on the other hand , optimally allocates signal power levels among users by setting the transmit power level at each transmitter and the noise floor level at each receiver .",
    "thus tin depends very much on the strengths of signals relative to each other . associating tim with signal vector space allocations and tin with signal power level allocations within the multilevel topological interference management framework",
    ", we refer to the joint allocation of signal vector spaces and signal power levels as the tim - tin problem .",
    "_ tim - tin problem : _ with only a coarse knowledge of channel strengths available to the transmitters , we wish to carefully allocate not only the beamforming vector directions ( signal vector spaces ) but also the transmit powers ( signal power levels ) to each of those beamforming vectors .",
    "the necessity of a joint tim - tin perspective is evident as follows . in vector space allocation schemes",
    "used for dof studies , the signal space containing the interference is entirely rejected ( zero - forced ) .",
    "this is typically fine for linear dof studies because all signals are essentially equally strong , every substream carries one dof , so any desired signal projected into the interference space can not achieve a non - zero dof .",
    "however , once we account for the difference in signal strengths in a generalized degrees of freedom ( gdof ) framework , the signal vector space dimensions occupied by interference may not be _ fully _ occupied in terms of power levels if the interference is weak .",
    "so , non - zero gdof may be achieved by desired signals projected into the same dimensions as occupied by the interference , where interference is weaker than desired signal .",
    "it is this aspect that we wish to exploit in the multilevel topological interference management framework . in this preliminary work , which represents our first steps in this direction",
    ", our focus will not be on optimality , but rather on simplicity and robustness .",
    "in particular , we will formulate the problem and identify a natural baseline against which more sophisticated schemes may be compared .",
    "similar to @xcite , we represent the channel model in the following form , @xmath2 where at each time index @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the transmitted symbol of transmitter @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the received signal at receiver @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the complex channel gain and phase value from transmitter @xmath5 to receiver @xmath7 , and @xmath10 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at receiver @xmath7 .",
    "all symbols are complex .",
    "each transmitter @xmath5 is subject to the power constraint @xmath11\\leq 1 $ ] .",
    "we will call the exponent @xmath12 the channel strength level of the link between transmitter @xmath5 and receiver @xmath7 , and as done in @xcite , we will assume the @xmath12 values are non - negative ( the negative values are mapped to zero ) .",
    "the definitions of messages , achievable rates , capacity region , generalized degrees of freedom ( gdof ) are all standard ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) so they will not be repeated here .",
    "consider the general @xmath0-user interference channel presented in ( [ equ_channel ] ) .",
    "suppose over @xmath13 channel uses each user @xmath14 sends out @xmath15 independent scalar data streams , each of which carries one symbol @xmath16 and is transmitted along the @xmath17 beamforming vector @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "note the symbol @xmath16 comes from independent gaussian codebooks , each with zero mean and unit power , and the beamforming vectors @xmath18 are scaled to have unit norm . then over @xmath13 channel uses , at receiver @xmath7 we obtain the @xmath17 vector ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the @xmath17 awgn vector at receiver @xmath7 , and @xmath22 is the power allocated to the @xmath23-th data stream of user @xmath5 . all @xmath24 because of the power constraint .    for receiver @xmath7 ,",
    "the covariance matrix of the desired signal is @xmath25 and the covariance matrix of the interference from transmitter @xmath26 @xmath27 so that the covariance matrix of the net interference - plus - noise @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an @xmath30 identity matrix .",
    "then for each user @xmath7 , given the beamforming vectors and power allocation for each data stream , the achievable rate per channel use is @xmath31\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{n}\\big\\{\\log[\\det(\\mathbf{q}^d_k+\\mathbf{q}^{n+i}_k)]-\\log[\\det(\\mathbf{q}^{n+i}_k)]\\big\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the gdof @xmath32 can be written as @xmath33-\\log[\\det(\\mathbf{q}^{n+i}_k)]}{n\\log p}\\ ] ] to optimize a gdof tuple for such a tim - tin scheme , it is clear that one needs to optimize over both the directions of all beamforming vectors and the allocated power for all data streams .",
    "let us simplify the achievable gdof expression into a more intuitive form .",
    "consider a term of the type @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are @xmath17 beamforming vectors .",
    "we assume @xmath37 without loss of generality .",
    "then we consider the beamforming vectors one by one . for @xmath38 , we relabel it as @xmath39 and correspondingly its associated power exponent @xmath40 as @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , if it falls into @xmath43 , we remove it and then proceed to @xmath44 ; otherwise , we relabel it as @xmath45 and correspondingly its associated power exponent @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",

    "since the joint optimization of signal power levels and signal vector spaces for the general tim - tin problem seems challenging , we present a natural baseline based on a decomposition of the problem into tim and tin components , which can be solved separately and then combined to produce an achievable gdof tuple for the original problem . a tim - tin decomposition is defined as follows .",
    "given an interference network , two copies of the network are created , called the tim component and the tin component .",
    "the desired links are copied in both networks . however , each interfering link is mapped to either the tim component or the tin component ( but not both ) . note that many different tim - tin decompositions are possible .    in fig .",
    "[ 5user_1 ] , we give an example to show one possible decomposition of a @xmath91-user interference channel into a tin component and a tim component . in this figure ,",
    "the black and red links have strength 1.0 and the blue links have strength 0.5 . in the tim - tin decomposition shown in the figure ,",
    "the blue interference links are mapped to the tin component and the red ones to the tim component .",
    "the purpose of the tim - tin decomposition is to simplify the problem by solving the tim and tin components separately .",
    "first consider the tim component only .",
    "we assume all the non - zero links that are mapped to the tim component are equally strong ( even if they are not ) and find a linear tim solution to obtain the gdof tuple @xmath92 , which identifies the _ fraction _ of the interference - free signal space that is available to each user .",
    "next , we consider the tin component only .",
    "suppose through appropriate power control and tin , the gdof tuple @xmath93 is achievable , which identifies the available signal power levels .",
    "then the product of the two fractions for each user , i.e. , the gdof tuple @xmath94 is achievable , which identifies the net signal dimensions available to each user by this decomposition - based approach .",
    "the convex hull of all similarly achieved gdof - tuples corresponding to different tim - tin decompositions is also achievable through time - sharing .",
    "+    in fig . [ 5user_1](c ) , the tim component achieves symmetric dof of @xmath95 .",
    "this is seen from the alignment and conflict graphs shown in fig . [",
    "5user_1](d ) because there are no internal conflicts @xcite . in the tin component , which contains all the interfering links with strength 0.5 ,",
    "its symmetric gdof is determined by the longest zigzag chain embedded in the network topology @xcite .",
    "since the length of the longest zigzag chain is @xmath96 , the symmetric gdof of this network is @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , by tim - tin decomposition the achievable symmetric gdof for the original network is @xmath98 .",
    "the achievable scheme is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ 5user_1 ] .",

    "while the tim - tin decomposition is flexible , i.e. , any interfering link can be mapped into either tim or tin components , generally one would expect that to obtain a `` good '' achievable gdof region , the tim component should contain the appropriate `` strong '' interfering links and the tin component should contain the appropriate `` weak '' interfering links .",
    "this is , however , not always the case .    for the example of fig .",
