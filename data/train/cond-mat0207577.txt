    "in 1938 fallot@xcite discovered that ordered bcc fe@xmath1rh@xmath1 undergoes a first order metamagnetic transition from an antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase with increasing temperature .",
    "this transition occurs at @xmath2 and is accompanied by a volume increase of about @xmath3.@xcite the curie temperature @xmath4 of the fm phase is of the order of @xmath5.@xcite in contradiction to the first hypothesis of fallot and horcart,@xcite x - ray diffraction measurements showed that the transition is isostructural.@xcite from mssbauer and neutron diffraction measurements one knows that the fm phase has collinear magnetic moments of @xmath6 per fe atom and @xmath7 per rh atom.@xcite at low temperatures an af - ii spin structure is found with fe moments of @xmath8 and with vanishing rh moments ( see figure  [ fig : structure]).@xcite application of hydrostatic pressure suppresses the fm phase , i.e. for a critical pressure of @xmath9 the system immediately transforms from the af to the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase .",
    "an early explanation for this behavior was based on the phenomenological _ exchange inversion model_@xcite by kittel ( which originally was designed to explain metamagnetic transitions in other materials like cr - modified mn@xmath10sb with a layered magnetic structure ) . in this model",
    "the exchange parameter varies linearly with the lattice constant and changes sign for a critical value @xmath11 .",
    "however , experimental findings like the rather large entropy change@xcite at @xmath12 , which is of the order of @xmath13 , as well as elastic properties could not correctly be described.@xcite tu _ et al._@xcite used a different approach by considering the large difference of the low - temperature specific heat constants , @xmath14 , of the af and the fm phases : measurements suggest that @xmath15 is about four to six times larger than @xmath16.@xcite based on these observations , tu _ et al .",
    "_ explained the transition by a change in entropy of the band electrons between the af and the fm phases .",
    "an estimation of the free energy shows that these contributions have the right order of magnitude to explain the af  fm transition , if one assumes that the electronic densities of states at the fermi level do not vary considerably from low temperatures up to the transition .",
    "however , since the fm phase can not be stabilized at low temperatures for stoichiometric ferh , @xmath17 has been measured in slightly more iron - rich alloys . with respect to the strong sensitivity of the magnetic phase diagram to small departures from stoichiometry,@xcite one may doubt that the low temperature specific heat can be considered to be independent of concentration.@xcite a further drawback considering the explanation of tu",
    "_  arises from the fact that adding @xmath18 iridium boosts @xmath19 by almost an order of magnitude to a value of @xmath20:@xcite the compound fe@xmath21rh@xmath22ir@xmath23 also undergoes a metamagnetic transition with @xmath12 shifted to higher temperatures.@xcite since the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath17 is reversed in this material , the previously sketched explanation can not be applied to this case .    in 1992",
    "moruzzi and marcus performed _ ab initio _ calculations using spin polarized density functional theory ( dft ) in the framework of the local density approximation ( lda ) and the augmented spherical wave ( asw ) formalism.@xcite they calculated the total energy of ferh as a function of volume for different magnetic structures .",
    "they found that the af - ii spin structure is the ground state , whereas the fm structure is another stable solution with higher energy and a larger volume .",
    "for the moments they obtained @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( af phase ) and @xmath26 ( fm phase ) , in agreement with experimental results . in this work , we present further _ ab initio _ total energy calculations of stoichiometric @xmath0-ferh using the asw formalism and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite the corresponding code also allows to evaluate noncollinear alignment of spins ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "for many cases lda gives a reasonable description of the ground state properties of solids .",
    "however , in some cases it predicts the wrong ground state as e.g.  for iron@xcite .",
    "for fe , the hcp structure is found to be @xmath27mry lower in energy than the bcc phase .",
    "because ferh has also a bcc ground state lattice structure ( unlike pure rh ) , it is necessary to go beyond lda by using gga .",
    "we have considered different possible magnetic ground state structures presented in section  [ sec : abinitio ] . based then on the specific energetic order of resulting energy versus volume curves ,",
    "we discuss a new mechanism for the temperature driven metamagnetic transition in ferh .",
    "in contrast to prior explanations , our model does not rely on ground state properties or low temperature data alone .",
    "instead , we propose that thermal excitations at finite temperatures are the driving force for the transition .",
    "this is demonstrated in section  [ sec : simple ] on the basis of monte carlo simulations of an ising - type spin model , showing that a competition between af fe - fe exchange - interactions and a nonmagnetic rh state on the one hand and fm fe - rh interactions on the other is sufficient to explain the metamagnetic transition of ferh .",
    "inclusion of spatial degrees of freedom ( section  [ sec : extended ] ) by adding pair potentials and assuming a linear variation of the exchange parameter with the lattice parameter proves that this model explanation is in accordance with the _ ab initio _ data and leads furthermore to a nearly quantitative description of experimental details .",
    ".comparison of ab initio results.here , @xmath28 is the equilibrium volume of af and fm phases , @xmath29 is the energy difference per atom , @xmath30 is the fe magnetic moment , @xmath31 is the bulk modulus , and @xmath32 the density of states per formula unit at the fermi level .",
    "the moment on the rh sites is @xmath33 in the fm phase and zero in the af phase in all calculations . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      for the evaluation of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ext ] ) we use a textbook isothermal - isobaric monte carlo method ( e.g.  ref .  ) consisting of alternating spin and position updates for each atom and a global volume update step after finishing each lattice sweep .",
    "this algorithm has been used by the the authors in previous calculations and is explained in detail in the corresponding references.@xcite in order to simulate the metamagnetic transition , an additional global spin update step has to be introduced .",
    "we use the same algorithm as described in the last section for the spin system in connection with a simultaneous volume adaption .",
    "since the latter reduces the acceptance probability considerably , the global update scheme has to be repeated several thousands of times .",
    "it is not practicable to use a new spin configuration for each trial step , because the evaluation of the energy is comparatively time consuming . on the other hand",
    ", the new energy after solely rescaling the volume can be calculated very quickly , since due to the use of lennard - jones potentials the energy can be written as a function of integral powers of the lattice parameter . therefore , we choose a trial spin configuration as described before and compute the new energy .",
    "then we attempt a previously fixed number @xmath34 of metropolis steps , each with a newly chosen volume .",
    "if one step is accepted , we continue with the original spin configuration as trial system ( and so on ) until @xmath34 steps have been made .",
    "since the number of trial steps @xmath34 has been previously fixed , _ detailed balance _ is still valid .",
    "we have performed simulations with system sizes of @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "a direct metamagnetic transition could only be seen for system sizes up to @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation time ranged from @xmath38 up to @xmath39 lattice sweeps around @xmath12 with values from @xmath40 to @xmath41 for @xmath34 .",
    "as before we estimated gibbs free energy for zero pressure by integrating the specific heat according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) .      for a comparison of our model properties with the results of ab initio calculations , we calculated in isochoric simulations the energy as a function of the volume at low temperatures for different fixed spin structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t4 ] ) . here , we cooled a system of size @xmath42 exponentially down from @xmath43k down to @xmath44k .",
    "we find good agreement with the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : asw ] in the sense that the order of magnetic phases is similar .",
    "although the _ ab initio _ total energy differences are somewhat larger , this indicates that our model hamiltonian ( [ eq : ext ] ) is a qualitatively correct description of the mechanisms leading to a metamagnetic transition in ferh .    as in the simple model without volume - dependent terms , we find an abrupt increase of the magnetization in combination with a discontinuous decrease for the staggered magnetization with increasing temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p00 m ] ) .",
    "consequently the mean moment at the rh sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p00s2 ] ) also raises sharply around the metamagnetic transition temperature of @xmath45k . around the curie temperature",
    "@xmath46k the magnetization decreases more smoothly than for the simple model .",
    "this may be due to the enhancement of the effective exchange parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) which is caused by the lattice expansion .",
    "as expected from the low temperature calculations , the volume of the af phase is smaller than the volume of the fm phase throughout the stability range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p00v ] ) . for the freely fluctuating system",
    "a volume jump of @xmath47 occurs at @xmath12 .",
    "below @xmath4 the volume expansion is reduced in the fm phase , which is in qualitative agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "the bulk modulus @xmath48 of the af phase is about @xmath49 larger than the fm bulk modulus throughout the stability range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p00bs ] ) . around @xmath12 and @xmath4",
    "we find a considerable weakening of the material which is caused by the magneto - volume anomalies .",
    "the values for @xmath48 at low temperatures can be estimated more accurately by using a polynomial fit to the @xmath50-@xmath51 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : t4 ] .",
    "we find @xmath52gpa for the af phase and @xmath53gpa for the fm phase .",
    "these values are in good agreement with results of isobaric calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p00bs ] . compared with the results of _ ab initio _ calculations ( table  [ tab : ab_initio ] ) the absolute values are too large , whereas these calculations do not give a unanimous prediction for the sign and the magnitude of the difference @xmath54 ( with respect to the magnetic structures ) .",
    "experimental measurements@xcite of young modulus suggest that the bulk modulus of the af phase should in fact be lower than in the fm phase .",
    "the modulus of the af phase , however , has only been estimated in the vicinity of @xmath12 , where a weakening of the material ( as a precursor of the transition ) is present ( as in our simulations ) .",
    "the specific heats obtained for the extended model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p00cp ] ) resemble the findings for the spin - only hamiltonian  ( [ eq : simple ] ) , except that now additional contributions due to atomic displacements are included .",
    "this shows that the proposed explanation of the metamagnetic transition is still valid . since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ext ] )",
    "does not contain any kinetic terms , the low temperature value of the specific heat is only half of the dulong - petit limit of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the kinetic gas constant .",
    "the calculation of gibbs free energy @xmath57 for the model with classical motion ( [ eq : ext ] ) is more complicated than in the spin - only case ( [ eq : simple ] ) .",
    "first of all absolute values of @xmath57 can not be given , since the specific heat at zero temperature is finite and the resulting entropy would diverge .",
    "but since the limit for @xmath58@xmath59@xmath60 of @xmath61 is @xmath62 and hence the same for all magnetic structures , differences of free energies can be computed .",
    "in contrast to the previous section , the entropy contribution at zero temperature @xmath63 must be considered . as before a contribution from the magnetic system can be neglected , while we have to account for the differences in the elastic properties of fm and the af phases .",
    "since we only need the entropy at zero temperature , we choose an ensemble of harmonic oscillators as an approximation for our spatial degrees of freedom , neglecting the anharmonicity of the potentials and the coupling of the oscillators . differentiating the free energy obtained from the logarithm of the partition function leads then to a simple expression for the entropy difference , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the force constants of the harmonic potentials which are estimated from the curvature of the ground state energy ( versus lattice parameter ) curve . for the entropy difference",
    "we obtain then : @xmath67 . taking this into account",
    ", we achieve again a rather good value for @xmath12 . from the differences of internal energies at @xmath12",
    "we obtain for the entropy jump at the transition @xmath68 , which is within the range of experimental results .",
    "comparison of the calculated free energy with experimental values for @xmath69 shows excellent agreement .",
    "the experimental values have been obtained by a graphical integration of the magnetic field expressed as a function of the measured magnetization.@xcite extrapolation of experimental values to zero temperature shows that the energy difference @xmath70 between the af and fm phases is much better described by our model parameters than by _ ab initio _ results , since the latter show that @xmath71 is one order of magnitude too large .",
    "this discrepancy has already been noticed by moruzzi and marcus@xcite who relate this to the omission of zero point energy corrections in their total energy calculations .",
    "we propose on the basis of new _ ab initio _ results a mechanism for the metamagnetic transition in ferh at finite temperatures .",
    "in contrast to previous explanations , our model does not rely on a large difference between the low temperature specific heat constants of both phases .",
    "these are expected to be sensitive to external influences as both experimental measurements and band structure calculations suggest , so that it seems implausible that a constant contribution of the given magnitude might survive up to room temperature . instead , we propose that the existence of two magnetic states of rh atoms connected with competing fm fe - rh and af fe - fe exchange interactions are at the origin of the metamagnetic transition .",
    "the magneto - volume effects can simply be explained on the basis of distance dependent exchange parameters .",
    "the applicability of this mechanism to the fe - rh problem has been verified by monte carlo model calculations , showing that a metamagnetic transition of the desired kind does in fact occur and , by extending the model , magneto - volume effects and other experimental properties can be sufficiently well described .    as we have pointed out ,",
    "our explanation is in agreement with existing experimental data .",
    "however , a further check of our model would be a comparison with ( non - existing ) specific heat data from above @xmath4 down to very low temperatures for both , the af and fm phases . from this one",
    "could then estimate the magnetic contribution by subtracting the lattice part within the debye approximation , the electronic part and the contribution by the anharmonicity of the potentials.@xcite so far , the specific heat has only been determined in the range from @xmath43k to @xmath72k and only for the nearly stoichiometric rh - rich alloy.@xcite systematic measurements on the fe - rich side with a fm ground state and measurements under pressure , suppressing the metamagnetic transition would yield information whether a schottky - type excitation plays an important role , which should show up around @xmath73k in the magnetic contribution to the specific heat of ferromagnetic samples .",
    "monte carlo simulations with applied pressure are left for future work , since with increasing pressure and hence increasing @xmath12 a reliable estimation of the transition temperature is rather difficult and requires an improvement of the global mc step .",
    "first tests , however , showed that the location of the phase boundaries under pressure is in sufficient agreement with experimental data for pressures below @xmath74kbar and above @xmath75kbar , where the metamagnetic transition is completely suppressed .",
    "the tricritical point , if one exists , should be located somewhere between @xmath74kbar and @xmath75kbar for the parameters used here ."
