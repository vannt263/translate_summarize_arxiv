    "investigation of solar activity has a long history .",
    "the 11-year sunspot cycles were discovered by schwabe ( 1844 ) .",
    "detailed observations of sunspots locations on the solar disk and their sizes provided the latitudinal distribution during the cycle , known as the `` butterfly diagram '' . discovered by hale ( 1919 ) the flip - flop phenomenon of the global solar magnetic field with a period of 22 years showed the connection between variations of the sunspots number and the magnetic field evolution .",
    "taking into account the hale s law bracewell ( 1953 ) proposed to include the information about the periodical reversals of the magnetic field in the sunspot number series by assigning alternating positive and negative signs to the sunspot cycles , thus representing the sunspot cycles as a 22-year oscillation .",
    "bracewell suggested that the nonlinear temporal distribution of the sunspots number can be written in the form of a three - halfs law @xcite : @xmath0^{3/2}$ ] , where @xmath1 is a new `` linearized '' sunspot number , which is supposedly proportional to a typical strength of the sun s toroidal magnetic field .",
    "for an explanation of the magnetic field generation parker ( 1955 ) proposed a simple dynamo model , which describes the phenomenon as an action of two factors : the differential rotation and cyclonic convective vortices .",
    "the mean - field theory and discovery of the @xmath2-effect give us a general description of the process of magnetic field generation @xcite .",
    "for recent reviews we refer to charbonneau ( 2005 ) and brandenburg and subramanian ( 2005 ) .",
    "it is known that the dynamo process is characterized by algebraic and dynamic nonlinearities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the algebraic nonlinearity can be determined as influence of the magnetic field on fluid motions and on the kinetic helicity .",
    "this results in quenching of the electromotive force and limits the growth of the magnetic field .",
    "the evolution of the small - scale magnetic helicity in the turbulent plasma causes a dynamical nonlinearity in the dynamo process .",
    "the turbulent helicity conditionally can be divided into two parts : hydrodynamic and magnetic .",
    "the kinetic helicity describes helical turbulent fluid motions ; the magnetic helicity determines the order of twisted magnetic field lines . due to the fact that the kinetic helicity makes the magnetic field small - scaled",
    ", the back influence on the turbulent fluid motions can restrict the unlimited growth of the magnetic field . in the mean - field approach",
    "the magnetic helicity is separated into large- and small - scale components .",
    "because of the conservation of the total helicity a growth of the large - scale magnetic helicity due to the dynamo action is compensated by the growth of the small - scale helicity of opposite sign @xcite .",
    "thus , the small- and large - scale magnetic fields grow together and are mirror - asymmetrical .",
    "this means that the condition of magnetic helicity conservation is , perhaps , more severe for a restriction of the dynamo action than the condition of the energy conservation , which leads to quenching of the kinetic helicity . since the concept of magnetic helicity was introduce into the dynamo theory by pouquet _",
    "et al . _ ( 1976 ) many magnetic helicity models were suggested . for modeling the solar cycle we choose the formulation of kleeorin and ruzmaikin ( 1982 ) , explicitly based on the idea of magnetic helicity conservation .",
    "observational data of solar magnetic fields are in a reasonable agreement with the idea of the magnetic helicity conservation @xcite .",
    "similar dynamo models with magnetic helicity have been also considered in the context of galactic dynamos @xcite and have included helicity transport by mean flows @xcite , which prevents the effect of ` catastrophic ' helicity quenching ( e.g. brandenburg and subramanian , 2005 ) . in our model , we do nt include the helicity transport and consider the helicity quenching with a free parameter .    in this paper",
    ", we consider nonlinear behavior of the parker s dynamo model ( without magnetic helicity ) and the kleeorin - ruzmaikin model ( with magnetic helicity ) , and show that the latter can reproduce the qualitative behavior of the sunspot number variations during the solar cycles , including periodic and chaotic solutions for conditions of the solar convective zone . for simplicity , we use a `` low - order model '' approach ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reducing the dynamo equations to a simple nonlinear dynamical system . in section 2 , for consistency , we reproduce the formulations of the parker s and kleeorin - ruzmaikin s models , and discuss conditions of linear stability and solar parameters . in section  3",
    ", we present the numerical solutions and compare these with observed properties of the sunspot number variations in solar cycles .",
    "in a kinematic approximation the dynamo problem can be described by the induction equation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the vector of magnetic field , @xmath5 is the vector of fluid velocity , @xmath6 is the molecular magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the magnetic field , @xmath7 , and the fluid velocity , @xmath5 , can be separated in two components representing mean and fluctuating ( turbulent ) parts , or @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 represents the averaged over longitude magnetic field , @xmath11 is the fluctuating part of @xmath7 , @xmath12 represents mean global - scale motions in the sun , ( such as the differential rotation ) , @xmath13 is velocity of turbulent convective motions . taking into account that the average of fluctuations is zero ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) for the case of isotropic turbulence we obtain the following mean - field induction equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 describes the total magnetic diffusion , which is the sum of the turbulent and molecular magnetic diffusivity , @xmath18 ( usually @xmath19 ) ; parameter @xmath2 is helicity .",
    "the first term of the equation describes transport of magnetic field lines with fluid , the second term describes the @xmath2-effect , and the last term determines diffusion and dissipation of the field .    for describing the average magnetic field , following @xcite , we choose a local coordinate system , @xmath20 , where axis @xmath21 will represents the radial coordinate , axis @xmath22 is the azimuthal coordinate and axis @xmath23 coincides with colatitude ( figure 1 ) .",

    "the solutions grow in time for @xmath35 , and decay for @xmath36 .",
    "as described in section 3 , in the one - mode approximation the classical parker s dynamo model even in nonlinear cases gives only non - chaotic oscillatory solutions , and , therefore , can not explain the observed variations of the sunspot number in the solar cycles . for creating chaotic variations of the magnetic field in the low - mode approximation",
    "it is necessary to add to the parker s model a third equation describing variations of the magnetic helicity and its interaction with the large - scale magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we note that the absence of chaotic solutions in the parker s model with a simple algebraic quenching may be caused by the low - order truncation @xcite , and that in a general pde formulation chaotic solutions may appear @xcite .      in this section for clarity",
    "we reproduce the derivation of the equation for the magnetic helicity variations following @xcite . for this",
    "we consider helicity @xmath2 as a variable consisting of two parts , hydrodynamic ( @xmath37 ) and magnetic ( @xmath38 ) @xcite : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the lifetime of turbulent eddies , @xmath42 is the characteristic scale of turbulent motions in the convective zone , and @xmath43 is the turbulent diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is convenient to define the influence of the magnetic helicity on magnetic field using spectral density @xmath44 @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fluctuating part of the vector - potential of magnetic field , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is a wavevector .    to derive an equation for the averaged helicity density we multiply the basic induction equation written without the differential rotation term @xmath49 by the fluctuating part of the vector potential , @xmath50 ; and",

    "retain only the first two terms for the mean electric field @xcite @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58    then we find a relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath59 .",
    "for this we assume that in inertial range @xmath60 the last term of ( 15 ) can be written as @xmath61 where the helicity density spectrum , @xmath62 , can be described as @xcite : @xmath63^{-1}.\\ ] ] here @xmath64 is an outer scale of a turbulence , @xmath65 is the scale of the helicity spectrum cutoff .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath66 depends on the type of nonlinear interactions in the turbulent plasma .",
    "for example , @xmath67 describes the case of the kolmogorov spectrum , and @xmath68 corresponds to turbulence of interacting alfvn waves ( kraichnan s spectrum ) .",
    "in addition , factor @xmath66 was selected in such a way that coefficient @xmath69 coincides with the mean helicity .",
    "consequently , the magnetic helicity given by ( 8) becomes @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is relaxation time , averaged over the energy spectrum .    taking into account that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and substituting ( 17 ) into ( 18 ) we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "finally , multiplying equations ( 15 ) and ( 20 ) we obtain the expression for variations of the magnetic helicity in terms of the mean magnetic field : @xmath78-\\frac{\\alpha_{m}}{t},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 equation ( 21 ) is written for the case of an uniform turbulent diffusion ( @xmath80 ) , and when the magnetic reynolds number is large , @xmath81 . in this model",
    "we do not include transport of magnetic field by flows .    for further analysis of the kleeorin - ruzmaikin model",
    "we transform equations ( 4)-(5 ) and ( 21 ) in a nonlinear dynamical system in non - dimensional variables . following the approach of weiss _ et al . _",
    "( 1984 ) we average the system of equations ( 4 - 5 and 21 ) in a vertical layer to eliminate @xmath21-dependence of @xmath82 and @xmath31 and consider a single fourier mode propagating in the @xmath23-direction assuming @xmath83 ; then we get the following system of equations @xmath84.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this transformation allows us to investigate more easily various nonlinear regimes , from periodic to chaotic , and obtain relationships of the basic properties , such as the cycle growth and decay times , duration and amplitude .",
    "however , we note that the formulation and the interpretation of solutions of the simplified system are not straightforward because it does not adequately describes nonlinear coupling of the spatial harmonics .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a self - consistent method of reducing the dynamo equations , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , to a dynamical system .",
    "in particular , it follows from their study that the dominant modes of the toroidal field in the case of the solar dynamo are described by the harmonics , which are antisymmetric with respect to the equator ( in accordance with the hale law ) , @xmath85 , where @xmath23 is colatitude , and the wavenumber , @xmath48 , is even : @xmath86 the first @xmath87 harmonic has the largest growth rate .",
    "we retain only this mode in our dynamical model .",
    "this nonlinear dynamical system is solved numerically by using standard _",
    "mathematica _ software for high - precision integration of potentially stiff problems .",
    "for interpretation of solutions of the dynamical system in terms of the sunspot number properties we use the imaginary part of the toroidal component @xmath88 because it gives the amplitude of the antisymmetric harmonics , and approximate the sunspot number , @xmath89 , as @xmath90 , following bracewell s suggestion .",
    "of course , there might be different definitions of the relationship between characteristics of the magnetic field and the sunspot number parameter .",
    "we note that the solutions of the dynamical system are qualitatively similar for the different harmonics .",
    "nevertheless , we choose the parameters , which correspond to the solar situation .    making the following substitutions : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is a layer radius ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and taking into account that @xmath98 we obtain : @xmath99,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the non - dimensional dynamo number and helicity , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the alfvn speed , @xmath105 ( here we assume that @xmath106 is close to @xmath107 then @xmath108 @xcite ) and @xmath109",
    ", @xmath48 is a characteristic wavelength , rm is the magnetic reynolds number . in the next section",
    "we discuss the ratio of parameters when the variations become autonomous .",
    "first , we simplify the third equation of system ( 24 ) by neglecting the last term , because @xmath110 is very small for large magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "note , that hereafter we omit the hat symbol for all non - dimensional variables . hence ( 24 ) becomes @xmath111.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using a linearization procedure , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and taking into the account that the dynamo number is @xmath115 , we obtain the following equations @xmath116.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , considering solutions in the form @xmath117 we obtain the condition of linear stability : @xmath118 , in the approximation of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath121 the magnetic field does not grow .",
    "for @xmath122 we have a periodical solution like in the parker s model .",
    "the linear theory also provides the direction of the migration of the dynamo waves with latitude .",
    "these waves travel from higher to lower latitudes if @xmath34 is negative , and in the opposite direction for positive @xmath34 .",
    "thus , to make the model consistent with the butterfly diagram we consider the case of negative @xmath34 .      in order to estimate the range of parameters of the kleeorin - ruzmaikin model , and for modeling the solar cycle we used the standard model of the interior structure of the sun for the top , bottom and middle areas of the convective zone ( table 1 ) .",
    "the key parameter of the model is the dynamo number @xmath115 , because its magnitude determines behavior of the magnetic field .",
    "we remind that according to the condition of linear stability , @xmath123 should be greater than 2 . taking into account that @xmath102 , we assume that @xmath124 , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is a typical rotational velocity",
    ", @xmath95 is the radius of convective layers .",
    "parameter @xmath110 determines the influence of vector - potential @xmath82 on variations of magnetic helicity @xmath38 . from our estimates",
    "it follows that for the solar conditions @xmath127 .",
    "consequently , we can neglect the term with @xmath110 .",
    "the last non - dimensional parameter , @xmath128 , included in equations ( 24 ) describes the ratio of two characteristic times , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "parameter @xmath96 is estimated using the values of turbulent diffusivity @xmath131 from the mixing - length model , where @xmath132 is the pressure scale height , @xmath133 is the convective velocity . in the absence of helicity fluxes the value of the damping parameter @xmath128 is small .",
    "however , in reality the helicity fluxes increase the dissipation rate .",
    "this can be modeled as a damping term , which increases the effective value of @xmath128 @xcite . because of this the value of @xmath128 is to some extent uncertain .",
    "according to the model of parker ( equations 4 and 5 ) , the pure harmonic variations of the magnetic field occur for the dynamo - number @xmath134 .",
    "it is also known , that for @xmath135 we have solutions with increasing amplitude . following a standard procedure",
    ", we included a nonlinearity ( alpha - quenching ) as @xmath136 @xcite , where @xmath137 is a quenching parameter , which limits the growth of the magnetic field amplitude .",
    "examples of nonlinear solutions for the parker s model are shown in figure 2 .",
    "however , our numerical calculation showed that in the nonlinear regime the variations of the toroidal field ( figure 2a ) and the sunspot number ( figure 2b ) are also periodic and similar to the classical case of the linear harmonic solution for @xmath138 . for calculations of the model sunspot number we used bracewell s suggestion ( private communication ) of the connection between the toroidal field strength , @xmath31 , and the sunspot number , @xmath89 , in the form of the three - halfs law : @xmath139 .",
    "we note that the model shows a larger amplitude of variations for the poloidal component than for the toroidal field , and that there is a phase shift between them . however , comparing of the observed profiles of the solar cycles ( figure 9 ) with the solutions for the parker model ( figure 2b ) , we see that , in general , the model solutions have a sinusoidal character and do not describe the basic properties of the sunspot profiles with rapid growth and slow decay .    , and quenching parameter @xmath140 : @xmath141 ( solid black curve ) , @xmath142 ( grey curve ) , @xmath143 ( dotted curve ) and @xmath144 ( dashed curve ) . ]    for the kleeorin - ruzmaikin model , given by equations ( 24 ) , the linear instability condition is also @xmath145 .",
    "however , in this case the profile of the periodic solutions is not sinusoidal , and depends on the initial conditions , @xmath146 and @xmath147 . for higher initial values",
    "the amplitude of the nonlinear oscillations in the stationary state is higher .",
    "however , the shapes of the oscillation profiles are similar .",
    "figure 3 illustrates solutions for the model of kleeorin - ruzmaikin , and the corresponding variations of the sunspot number for different initial conditions .",
    "as mentioned , changes of initial values for magnetic field components @xmath148 and @xmath149 leads to very similar profiles . in high amplitude cases , dual peaks may appear in the variations of the vector potential , @xmath82 , of the poloidal field .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic helicity represents a relatively smooth growth followed by a sharp decay .",
    "the helicity has maxima when the toroidal field is zero . in these calculations",
    "the value of parameter @xmath128 , which describes damping rate of magnetic helicity and depends on the turbulence spectrum and the dissipation though helicity fluxes , is of the order of unity .",
    "finally , the variations of the sunspot number , @xmath89 , with the amplitude increase are characterized by higher peaks and shorter rising times ( figure 3d ) .",
    "note that in the sunspot number profile we can recognize the well - known general properties of the sunspot number profile with the rapid growth at the beginning of a cycle and a slow decrease after the maximum .",

    "the general behavior with growing cycle amplitudes and subsequent recessions continues , but the variations of amplitude become increasingly more chaotic ( figures 6 c , d ) .",
