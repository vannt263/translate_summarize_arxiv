    "the large number of recent publications on braneworld cosmology is a testament to the richness and difficulty of this comparatively new field ( see , for example , @xcite ) . despite the large gap in complexity between possible string / m - theory realisations and the greatly simplified models currently being investigated ,",
    "even the simplest models are extremely rich in new physics .",
    "many such five - dimensional toy models @xcite are motivated by the dimensional reduction of hoava - witten m - theory @xcite to five dimensions but miss out most of the resulting large number of bulk degrees of freedom.the extra dimension is assumed to have the topology of an @xmath0 orbifold , with two 3-branes residing at the boundaries of the spacetime at the two fixed points .",
    "the increase in complexity from a purely four - dimensional universe to one confined to a brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk is considerable .",
    "we shall therefore mainly focus on the randall - sundrum model @xcite , where the bulk is empty apart from a cosmological constant .",
    "we assume that the branes contain no matter and carry equal and opposite tensions finely tuned with respect to the bulk cosmological constant such that their induced cosmological constants vanish , although the conclusions of this paper will not depend sensitively on these assumptions . in the background case , where the transverse dimensions are assumed to possess cosmological symmetry , the lack of non - gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk then implies the existence of a _ birkhoff _ frame in which the bulk is manifestly static with anti - de - sitter(ads)-schwarzschild geometry , parameterised by @xmath4 ( related to the black hole mass ) and the lengthscale @xmath5 .",
    "the velocities of the branes are then determined entirely by their positions , and the system can be solved exactly even in the presence of matter on the branes ; the only deviation from four - dimensional einstein gravity is the presence in the friedmann equation of quadratic terms in the brane stress - energy and a dark radiation term proportional to @xmath4 , which contains all of the gravitational effects of the bulk .",
    "when one comes to include cosmological perturbations @xcite , however , the problem rapidly becomes intractable , largely due to the considerable increase in number of the gravitational degrees of freedom in going from four to five dimensions . to achieve any sort of analytic result on the propagation of braneworld perturbations one needs to resort to approximations .",
    "the simplest is to work to lowest order in the brane velocities , assuming also that the energy content of the branes is much less than their tensions .",
    "the result is a four - dimensional effective scalar - tensor theory @xcite , valid at low energies , formulated for example in terms of the induced metric of one of the branes .",
    "the scalar degree of freedom , known as the radion , corresponds to the distance between the two branes .    attempting to go beyond the very limiting low - energy approximation requires a method of solving the five - dimensional einstein equations .",
    "while a great deal of progress has been made recently @xcite , the problem is still very difficult .",
    "the five - dimensional analysis is rendered simpler by choosing a gauge in which the branes are located at fixed positions .",
    "the further assumptions that the coordinate @xmath1 parameterising the extra dimension is chosen such that both the cross terms @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 labels the transverse time and space dimensions ) vanish and @xmath8 result in a particularly useful gauge , henceforth referred to as a _ simple fixed - brane _ ( sfb ) gauge .",
    "several publications @xcite have already assumed , without proof , the existence of sfb gauges to derive effective theories with different , more useful regimes of validity than the low - energy scalar - tensor theory .",
    "in particular they focused on the small - radion limit pertinent to recent attempts to model the big bang as a brane collision @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in  [ 5d formalism ]",
    "we discuss the general problem of constructing sfb gauges , specialising in  [ background ] to the special case of background spacetimes with cosmological symmetry . for the case of two branes moving apart after a collision , initially considered in the birkhoff frame , we construct in  [ t expansion ] the required coordinate transformation as a power series in the sfb time @xmath9 , equivalent to an expansion in the radion .",
    "we show that such a gauge can be found correct to arbitrary orders in @xmath9 , although there is in general no analytic expression for the terms in the series and one must resort to numerical methods",
    ". we also comment on the convergence of this series and its relation to the horizon structure of the bulk .",
    "a second method is derived in  [ c expansion ] , namely an expansion in @xmath10 , which is equivalent to the velocity of the branes .",
    "this turns out to be simpler , with analytic expressions available at all orders .",
    "finally we discuss cosmological perturbations in  [ perturbations ] , and show the existence of the gauge transformations which will accommodate general perturbations into an sfb gauge .",
    "we take our spacetime to be an @xmath0 orbifold with two boundary branes at the fixed points .",
    "we assume first of all the existence of a gaussian - normal coordinate system relative to the positive tension brane at @xmath11 , with metric [ gn metric ] s^2=^2 + h_(,)^^.throughout this paper greek indices will run over @xmath12 and denote the transverse spatial @xmath13 and temporal @xmath14 coordinates , and @xmath15 etc .",
    "are five - dimensional indices running over @xmath12 and @xmath16 for the orbifold dimension .",
    "the location of the positive - tension brane at @xmath17 is not crucial for the discussion , of more importance is the form of the metric with @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the sake of simplicity in the following argument .",
    "though the coordinate system ( [ gn metric ] ) is particularly simple , the second brane will , in general , lie on a spacetime - dependent trajectory @xmath20 . implementing the israel junction conditions on a moving brane",
    "is a complicated procedure @xcite ; far simpler is to use a coordinate system in which the branes lie at fixed positions , at the cost of losing the simple form of the metric ( [ gn metric ] ) .",
    "a general coordinate transformation to bring the branes to fixed positions will introduce off - diagonal terms @xmath21 and a non - trivial @xmath22 to the metric .",
    "however , the aim of this paper is to show the existence of a ` simplest possible ' sfb gauge where both the non - diagonal metric terms vanish and @xmath22 has no dependence on the extra dimension @xmath23 [ fixed gauge ] s^2=d(x)^2y^2+g_(x , y)x^x^,in which the branes lie at the fixed positions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the metric coefficient @xmath26 can then be viewed as a four - dimensional scalar field which plays the rle of the radion , giving the proper distance between the branes on curves of constant @xmath27 .",
    "note that , as discussed in @xcite , this definition of the radion is frame dependent . as we shall see in  [ background dynamics ] , this function is expected to be monotonically increasing ( for the homogeneous cosmological background ) for the case of two branes moving apart after a collision , and vanishes only at the surface of collision .    defining the diffeomorphism [ f , g 5d ] ^=f^(x^,y),=g(x^,y),we",
    "must then find @xmath28 functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that [ diag ] g+h_(f^,g)f^&=&0 + [ k ] ( ) ^2+h_(f^,g)&=&d(x^)^2>0.the new metric is then of the form ( [ fixed gauge ] ) .",
    "@xmath31 must then satisfy boundary conditions related to the positions @xmath32 of the branes in the original frame ( [ gn metric ] ) [ g bc ] g(x,0)=_+(f(x,0)),g(x,1)=_-(f(x,1))in order to bring the positions of the branes in the new frame to @xmath24 for the positive - tension brane and @xmath25 for the negative - tension brane .",
    "note that there is a residual gauge freedom of @xmath33-reparameterisation which leaves both the form of the metric and the brane positions invariant .",
    "this system of non - linear , partial differential equations is extremely difficult to tackle in general .",
    "however , since we are ultimately interested in cosmological braneworlds , we will at first only need to consider these equations for the homogeneous case , effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem from five to two .",
    "furthermore , this paper is only concerned with randall - sundrum style braneworlds where the bulk contains only a ( negative ) cosmological constant ; staticity of the bulk then follows in the homogeneous case from birkhoff s theorem .",
    "this static _ birkhoff frame _ is of the form ( [ gn metric ] ) and we investigate its properties in the next section .",
    "we will describe two methods of constructing the coordinate transformation satisfying ( [ diag ] ) and ( [ k ] ) for the background , and then turn our attention to cosmological perturbations .",
    "in this section we re - derive some standard results on the propagation of branes in the static birkhoff frame background @xcite , with metric [ birkhoff ] s^2=y^2-n^2(y)t^2+a^2(y)^2 where [ a ] a^2(y)&=&e^-2 y / l+  e^2 y",
    "/ l + [ n ] n^2(y)&=&a^2-a(y)=-n(y)/l the bulk geometry is schwarzschild - ads , with the ads lengthscale @xmath5 related to the cosmological constant @xmath34 by @xmath35 and the parameter @xmath4 proportional to the mass of the bulk black hole .",
    "we assume that the brane tensions are fine - tuned to the usual values @xmath36 where the five - dimensional gravitational constant has been set to unity for convenience .",
    "the spatial curvature is assumed to vanish for simplicity .    in this frame",
    "the branes will not be static , but follow trajectories @xmath37 .",
    "assuming for the moment that the branes are empty , the israel junction conditions are simply [ junction ] k^a _ b=-^a_bwhere @xmath38 are the extrinsic curvatures of the branes . the space - space components of this equation then give the first - order equations of motion @xcite [ dydt ] ( ) ^2=cwhere @xmath39 etc .",
    "since we are interested in brane collisions we assume that @xmath40 are of opposite signs , specifically that @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the proper time @xmath43 on the branes can then be determined , giving the world velocities and accelerations as [ world velocity ] = & , & = + [ acceleration ] = -&,&=-the above equations imply that , for empty , fine - tuned , spatially - flat branes , one can not achieve a consistent embedding into the negative mass schwarzschild - ads spacetime with @xmath44 .",
    "it also implies that , under the same conditions , the @xmath45 solution is the trivial case where the branes remain static and the frame reduces to the usual ads warp - factor profile , although from ( [ acceleration ] ) we see that the branes are still accelerating .",
    "we shall therefore henceforth only consider the case of _ positive _ spacetime mass @xmath46 . in this case",
    "there is a horizon in the bulk where @xmath47 vanishes , given by [ horizon ] y_=.the coordinate system ( [ birkhoff ] ) will only be valid in a particular coordinate patch bounded by the horizon .",
    "one would therefore expect any results in this paper derived from this coordinate system only to be valid up to the point where one of the branes hits the horizon ( in other words , for the physical slice of spacetime bounded by the two branes to develop a horizon ) . since @xmath48-translation is a symmetry of the metric ( [ birkhoff ] ) we can assume that the brane collision occurs at @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "1 shows the branes trajectories in the birkhoff frame with @xmath51 .",
    "note that a brane crossing the horizon will do so in finite proper time but will require an infinite @xmath52 , since from ( [ dydt ] ) we see that the brane velocity with respect to the birkhoff time @xmath48 tends to zero as the horizon is approached . the corresponding picture as a penrose diagram is illustrated in fig .  2 , showing the region of the extended schwarzschild - ads spacetime corresponding to the coordinate patch ( [ birkhoff ] ) .",
    "in this picture , the horizon at @xmath53 can be interpreted as the event horizon of the bulk black hole .",
    "note that the physical spacetime is just the slice bounded by the two branes ( or , rather , two copies of it due to the orbifold nature of the complete spacetime ) .",
    "importantly , it follows from ( [ dydt ] ) and ( [ world velocity ] ) that the friedmann equation on the brane is simply @xmath54 , i.e. the background geometry is finite at the collision @xcite .",
    "the event is , however , singular from a five - dimensional perspective , in that the fifth dimension momentarily vanishes . in general perturbations",
    "will diverge due to the blue - shifting of their energies as the radius of the fifth dimension vanishes , although several authors recently have claimed that this need not be an obstacle to the propagation either of cosmological perturbations @xcite or , more fundamentally , string excitations @xcite across the bounce .    .",

    "the trajectory of the positive- tension brane is denoted by the solid ( dashed ) line .",
    "the physical region of spacetime is that bounded by the two branes .",

    "we can therefore just leave these coordinates alone , , and focus on the two - dimensional @xmath55 portion of the metric .",
    "as before , we consider a diffeomorphism [ fg 2d ] t = f(y , t ) ,  y = g(y , t).the conditions ( [ diag ] ) and ( [ k ] ) on the form of the new metric become [ eqn 1 ] g_y g_t&=&n(g)^2 f_y f_t + [ eqn 2 ] g_y^2&=&n(g)^2 f_y^2+d(t)^2,giving [ fixed metric ] s^2=d(t)^2y^2 - b(y , t)^2t^2 + a(y , t)^2 ^2where @xmath56 it is at this point that the assumption that the metric ( [ birkhoff ] ) is static ( i.e. that we are concerned only with randall - sundrum - style braneworlds , with no non - gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk ) comes in .",
    "this implies that @xmath57 is only a function of @xmath30 , rather than @xmath58 as would be expected more generally .",

    "[ background dynamics ] , the distance between the two branes is a monotonically - increasing function after the collision .",
    "this implies that one can exploit the @xmath9-reparameterisation of the metric to fix [ t gauge fix ] d(t)=t.it turns out that this gauge choice ensures the existence of a perturbative expansion of the functions @xmath59 and @xmath30 in powers of @xmath9 , as well as corresponding to the linear approximation for close branes used in @xcite .",

    "the fact that the branes are moving in opposite directions , not immediately apparent from the boundary conditions since the @xmath75 sign in ( [ gt0 ] ) has been lost , follows from the choice of gauge ( [ t gauge fix ] ) .",
    "we now proceed to solve ( [ g  ] ) subject to the boundary conditions ( [ gy bc ] ) as a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath9 .",

    "the accuracy of the agreement is high , as can be seen from the fig .",
    "also plotted are the trajectories calculated using only the first - order expression for @xmath81 , with the same range of @xmath9 ; these clearly differ wildly from the higher - order results as the horizon is approached .",

    "an alternative method of finding the required gauge ( [ fixed gauge ] ) is to consider an expansion in the velocity of the branes ( [ dydt ] ) .",

    "<S> we focus on models where the bulk is empty apart from a negative cosmological constant , which , in the case of cosmological symmetry , implies the existence of a static frame with schwarzschild - ads geometry . considering the background case with the branes moving apart after a collision </S>",
    "<S> , we show that such a gauge can be constructed perturbatively , expanding in either the time after collision or the brane velocity . </S>",
    "<S> finally we examine how cosmological perturbations can be accommodated in such a gauge .    </S>",
