    "multi - component fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states appear in a wide variety of two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des )  @xcite , such as multilayer or multisubband quantum wells  @xcite , systems with small zeeman energy where the electron spin plays an active role , and systems with multiple valley degrees of freedom , such as graphene  @xcite , silicon  @xcite , and alas  @xcite .",
    "these systems offer several tunable parameters , which allow the observation of rich zero temperature phase diagrams involving topologically distinct fqh states even at a fixed total filling fraction , and indeed novel fqh phases of multicomponent systems have been experimentally observed .",
    "most notable perhaps is the observation of the so - called 331 abelian even - denominator fqh state in half - filled bilayer systems  @xcite .",
    "however , in many cases , little is known about the myriad possible fqh phases and phase transitions that can be experimentally realized in multi - component 2des",
    ".    recently , motivated by the possibility of a non - abelian state at @xmath6 in gaas quantum wells  @xcite , there have been detailed numerical studies at total filling fraction @xmath7 ( @xmath1 integer ) in two - component systems @xcite .",
    "while @xmath8 has been studied in great detail , the problem at @xmath2 has received comparatively less attention from numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "such systems were first studied experimentally over 20 years ago , where a two - component to single - component phase transition was observed in monolayer ( presumably due to spin ) and bilayer systems  @xcite .",
    "there are three abelian fqh states that can be realized at @xmath9 : the @xmath10 state , @xmath11 consisting of two decoupled @xmath12 laughlin states in each layer where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for @xmath15 are the complex coordinates of the electrons in the two layers , and here and hereafter we have omitted the gaussian factor @xmath16 for all wave functions , a pseudo - spin singlet abelian state , here called the @xmath17 state , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lll projection operator , and the particle - hole conjugate of the @xmath12 laughlin state , referred to here as the @xmath20 laughlin state , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wave function for the @xmath23 integer quantum hall state .",
    "the pseudo - spin singlet @xmath17 state can be easily understood within composite fermion theory as composite fermions filling the lowest spin - up and spin - down levels in a reversed effective magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "early numerical work on @xmath24 bilayers considered the overlap of model wave functions with the exact ground state of the system for @xmath25 electrons on a torus  @xcite , finding these three phases in the two - component 2d system ( for the monolayer spinful system , the @xmath10 state is unlikely ) .    .",

    "these states occur at different shifts @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of flux quanta .",
    "the fibonacci state , as a single - component system , has a shift of 6 ; as a two - component system , it has a shift of 3 per layer . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     different theoretical studies have suggested five possible exotic non - abelian fqh states can occur at @xmath24 , yet have not been numerically investigated ( see table  [ statestable ] ) .",

    "it should be noted that the @xmath3 parafermion and the intralayer pfaffian states are defined only when the number of electrons @xmath34 is divisible by @xmath36 .",
    "as a result , the @xmath37 overlap study  @xcite did not actually rule out the possibility of having stable non - abelian phases even in the lowest landau level .",
    "the @xmath3 and fibonacci states have been shown theoretically to exhibit continuous phase transitions from the @xmath10 state  @xcite , suggesting these states might be stabilized nearby more conventional ones if appropriate microscopic parameters are found and tuned experimentally . the goal of our work is to investigate numerically the possible existence of exotic non - abelian 2/3 ( or generally , @xmath38 ) fqh states in realistic 2des .",
    "the fibonacci fqh state contains the non - abelian fibonacci quasiparticle , whose braiding statistics is known to be powerful enough to be utilized for universal topological quantum computation ( tqc )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 parafermion fqh state is based on the @xmath39 topological quantum field theory , which has been discovered to allow for universal tqc  @xcite .",
    "the bonderson - slingerland hierarchy state at @xmath2 , and the interlayer pfaffian state , can also be used for universal tqc if realized on topologically non - trivial spaces with topological operations known as dehn twists  @xcite that can be realized in a physically realistic experimental setup  @xcite .",

    "this unexpected new finding suggests the already experimentally observed @xmath41 fqh state may be the exotic @xmath3 non - abelian state , rather than the usual abelian laughlin state .",
    "given the existence of the @xmath42 fqh state in the sll , thought to be the non - abelian moore - read state , the possibility that the sll @xmath41 fqh state might also be a ( different ) non - abelian state is plausible and consistent with the fact that the experimental @xmath41 state typically is considerably weaker than the 5/2 state as manifested in the measured energy gaps  @xcite .",

    "we refer to ref .   for the details of the monte carlo energy calculation and ref .   for the efficient evaluation of composite fermion wavefunctions .",
    "it turns out that the anti - symmetrization used to construct @xmath107 [ eq .  ( [ eq : z4 ] ) ] is prohibitively expensive for numerical calculations , hence , we leverage the jack polynomial representation of @xmath107 to directly obtain its second - quantized amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this technique allows us to obtain the state and compute its variational energy , i.e. , the expectation value of hamiltonian for @xmath107 , for up to @xmath108 electrons , well beyond the scope of exact diagonalization .",
    "we assess the relative stability of different phases of the two - component system by comparing their variational energies .",
    "to estimate the energy per particle in the thermodynamic limit , we use quadratic extrapolation in @xmath109 , weighted by the statistical error on each data point  @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated energy has an error between @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the phase diagram is determined according to the wavefunction with the lowest energy , and we characterize the phase stability using the energy advantage @xmath104 of the dominant wavefunction over its closest competitor . figure  [ fig : mc - lll - sll ] shows the contour plots of @xmath112 . in the lll , the phase diagram determined by variational energies is in qualitative agreement with the ed results .",
    "we find that the non - abelian @xmath3 and the interlayer / intralayer pfaffian states remain energetically unfavorable throughout the phase diagram , and the singlet 112 occupies a very small corner of the parameter space . in the sll , while the halperin 330 state still dominates at large layer separation @xmath59 , the laughlin state at large @xmath44 is now much less stable compared with the lll .",
    "the main competition comes from the non - abelian @xmath3 state .",
    "in fact , for much of the phase diagram , the energy difference between the two is on the same order as the estimated extrapolation error @xmath113 for the @xmath3 state .",
    "this is in strong agreement with our gap and overlap calculations using ed , namely , that the non - abelian @xmath3 state is highly competitive with the laughlin state .",
    "incidentally , we also find a small region in the parameter space that favors the intralayer pfaffian state , but we do not find any parameter set that stabilizes the interlayer pfaffian state .",
    "based on our exact diagonalization and monte carlo studies , we find that @xmath4 bilayers in the lll , in the limit of weak ll mixing , most likely do not realize the non - abelian @xmath3 parafermion state .",
    "most remarkably , in the single - component limit of the sll , the non - abelian @xmath3 phase may be favorable for the @xmath41 fqh state relative to the laughlin state .",
    "indeed , previous studies of the experimentally obtained energy gaps of fqh states in the sll have already indicated the possibility that the electron correlations are sufficiently different from those of the lll and that novel exotic states might be realized  @xcite . while weak quasiparticle tunneling experiments through a quantum point contact  @xcite suggest that @xmath102 is the 2/3 laughlin state , it can not be considered to be definitive yet and more experiments are necessary .",
    "the implication of our finding that the observed @xmath41 sll fqh state may be the parafermionic @xmath3 non - abelian phase is enormous since this state can be utilized for universal topological quantum computation .",
    "as this work was being completed , we became aware of a related manuscript  @xcite by geraedts et al . by utilizing primarily the density matrix renormalization group technique",
    ", they reported that the interlayer pfaffian is stabilized for a modified lll interaction with a hollow core , which is very different from the lll and sll realistic coulomb interactions considered in our work .",
    "it is an interesting open question whether the disparity between the present work and that of ref .",
    "is due to differences in techniques , differences in models , or both .",
