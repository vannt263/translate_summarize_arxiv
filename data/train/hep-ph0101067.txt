    "it also persists in the presence of a nonzero electron chemical potential @xmath3 , so long as @xmath3 is not too large @xcite . in the absence of any interaction ( and thus in the absence of cfl pairing ) either a quark mass difference or a nonzero @xmath3 pushes the fermi momenta for different flavors apart , yielding different number densities for different flavors . in the cfl phase , however , the fact that the pairing energy is maximized when @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 number densities are equal enforces this equality @xcite .",
    "this means that if one imagines increasing either the strange quark mass @xmath7 or @xmath3 , nothing happens until a first order phase transition , at which cfl pairing is disrupted , ( some ) quark number densities spring free under the accumulated tension , and a less symmetric state of quark matter is obtained @xcite .",

    "whereas in the bcs state , obtained for @xmath19 , pairing occurs between quarks with equal and opposite momenta , when @xmath16 it is favorable to form a condensate of cooper pairs with nonzero total momentum . this",

    "the direction of @xmath27 is chosen spontaneously .",
    "the loff phase is characterized by a gap parameter @xmath28 and a diquark condensate , but not by an energy gap : the quasiparticle dispersion relations vary with the direction of the momentum , yielding gaps which vary from zero up to a maximum of @xmath28 .",

    "the intricacy arises from the fact that the definition of the boundary of the pairing region involves @xmath28 itself .",
    "a derivation in which one simply makes an ansatz for the quantum numbers of the condensate and then `` turns a field - theoretical crank '' and sees this intricate result emerge would be helpful both by virtue of being more straightforward and because the use of variational methods to obtain a gap equation is by now less familiar to many readers .",
    "we provide such a diagrammatic derivation here .",

    "@xcite , we restrict our attention here to the simplest possible `` crystal '' structure , namely that in which the condensate varies like a plane wave . wherever this condensate is favored over the homogeneous bcs condensate and over the state with no pairing at all ( i.e. where @xmath34 ) we expect that the true ground state of the system is a condensate which varies in space with some more complicated spatial dependence .",
    "the formalism we set up can be generalized to derive gap equations for , and hence to analyze and compare , condensates with arbitrary crystal structures in order to learn which one is favored . *",
    "the diagrammatic analysis we present uses a point - like interaction between quarks , but the formalism is easily generalized to treat the exchange of a propagating gluon , as appropriate at asymptotically high densities .",
    "even if such analyses , pioneered at @xmath39 in ref . @xcite and since studied in considerable detail by many authors @xcite , are to date of quantitative value only at inaccessibly high densities @xcite , it would be very interesting to see crystallization occurring in a controlled analysis beginning directly from the qcd lagrangian .",

    "the result would be a condensate which varies in space like a sum of plane waves .",
    "for example , a cubic crystal arises as a sum of six plane waves . the favored crystal structure for the crystalline color superconductor is not known . in this paper , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we only consider the simplest possibility ( [ loffcondensate ] ) .",

    "anomalous propagation does not only mean picking up or losing two quarks from the condensate .",
    "it also means picking up or losing momentum @xmath59 .",

    "that the condensate is explicitly antisymmetric in flavor .",
    "color and dirac indices remain suppressed . as desired , the off - diagonal blocks describe anomalous propagation in the presence of a condensate of diquarks with momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the choice of basis we have made is analogous to that introduced previously in the analysis of a crystalline quark - antiquark condensate@xcite .",
    "this work also points the way toward the generalization of ( [ psi ] ) needed to handle a condensate which varies in space like a cubic crystal rather than the plane wave ( [ loffcondensate ] ) .",

    "@xmath68 looks unusual , because it depends on both @xmath70 and the `` offset '' @xmath27 .",
    "this is a consequence of our choice of basis ( [ psi ] ) , and would be a legitimate if perverse way to describe noninteracting fermions .",
    "this choice of basis is natural in the crystalline color superconducting phase .",

    "@xcite , we choose to caricature the interaction between quarks as a point - like four - fermion interaction with the quantum numbers of single - gluon exchange .",

    "dropping @xmath102 on the right - hand side before integration ( but keeping them on the left - hand side ) should therefore be a good approximation .",

    "we now turn .",
    "we can now derive the gap equation for the loff state at nonzero temperature .",
    "we begin with . using the standard formalism",

    "we may deform the contour so that it encircles , with negative orientation , the poles off the imaginary axis .",

    "the reason is that at @xmath182 , specifying the boundaries of @xmath139 of ( [ preg ] ) , and thus the limits of integration , can be a numerical challenge . at any nonzero temperature , instead",
    ", no limits of integration need be specified .",
    "the @xmath183 factors impose the required limits as @xmath184 gets small .",

    "we choose @xmath74  mev , and explore different values of @xmath12 . at @xmath182@xcite",
    ", we find nonzero solutions to the gap equation ( [ abrgapeq ] ) for @xmath188 . above @xmath33 ,",
    "no pairing between @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks is possible .",
    "the crystalline color superconductor phase has lower free energy than the ordinary bcs phase as long as @xmath189 , where a first order phase transition occurs .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath40 requires expressions for the free energy of both phases",
    ". the free energy of the crystalline color superconductor phase could be obtained from the gap equation along the lines described in section 4.3 of ref .",
    "however , @xmath40 is well approximated by the @xmath12 at which the bcs and unpaired states have equal free energy , which turns out to be @xmath190 @xcite . at @xmath35 , @xmath191  mev @xcite .",
    "for @xmath38 from below , @xmath28 vanishes like @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "the window @xmath34 widens if the interaction includes attraction in the spin - one channel .",
    "we expect this window to widen at asymptotic density , where quarks interact by exchanging a propagating gluon .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show the dependence of @xmath28 on the temperature @xmath184 at @xmath35 .",
    "we find that the critical temperature above which the crystalline color superconductivity is lost is @xmath193  mev , corresponding to @xmath194 . in fig .",

    ". this agrees with the previously known result that @xmath198 for @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "there are two _ a priori _ reasons why one may have questioned whether @xmath41 in the crystalline color superconducting phase would turn out to be proportional to @xmath195 .",
    "first , this phase is in fact gapless .",
    "there are directions in momentum space ( which intersect the boundaries of the blocking regions ) for which gapless excitations exist at zero temperature .",
    "one may wonder whether the presence of these gapless modes , which can be excited at arbitrarily low temperature , might lower @xmath41 .",
    "second , the condensation energy in the crystalline color superconductor phase is of order @xmath199 @xcite , whereas that in the ordinary bcs phase is of order @xmath200 .",
    "one may therefore wonder whether the @xmath41 for crystalline color superconductivity scales differently with @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out , however , that the simplest expectation holds true : @xmath28 is the gap in the fermion spectrum in directions in momentum space along which pairing is maximized and destroying the condensate therefore requires a temperature @xmath41 which is of order @xmath28 .",
