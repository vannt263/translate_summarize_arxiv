    ", a local limit theorem holds stating that @xmath179 with @xmath180 defined by @xmath181 , @xmath182 ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "all classical discussions of such results make heavy use of fourier transform techniques .",
    "it is easy to use these techniques to see that if a symmetric probability density @xmath4 with generating support on @xmath125 has finite @xmath171-moment for some @xmath78 , then we must have @xmath183 and @xmath184 as laws that are in the domain of attraction of a symmetric stable law of index @xmath185 have finite @xmath171-moment , we also get that @xmath186 hence @xmath187 .",
    "note that determining the exact behavior of @xmath188 appears to be a somewhat subtle problem and will not be discussed here .",
    "both the fourier transform and explicit examples such as symmetric stable laws are not available on most noncommutative groups so that the arguments outlined above must be replaced by different ideas . our approach is as follows :    our lower bounds on @xmath189 are obtained and expressed via the function @xmath43 given by  ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "this function @xmath43 describes the decay of convolution powers of symmetric , nondegenerate densities with finite second moment on the group @xmath0 . to transfer the information contained in this function @xmath43 and",
    "make it relevant to the study of the convolution powers of measures with finite @xmath171-moment , we will use a sort of interpolation argument , the comparison of dirichlet forms and the notion of von neumann trace .",
    "each one of these ingredients plays a crucial role in obtaining our lower bounds .",
    "section  [ sec - compd ] contains the proof of proposition  [ pro1 ] as well as an interesting and important variation on definition  [ def1 ] .",
    "it also develops the key interpolation argument which leads to the comparison of important quadratic forms including the dirichlet forms of the probability measures we want to study .",
    "the role of the notion of von neumann trace is explained in the where related needed material is described .",
    "the results developed in the are the tools that allow us to turn the comparison of quadratic forms obtained in section  [ sec - compd ] into lower bound for @xmath189 .",
    "to obtain upper bounds on @xmath189 , it suffices to exhibit some probability densities satisfying the desired moment condition and whose convolution powers can be estimated . on a general noncommutative group",
    ", this is not necessarily an easy task .",
    "one possible technique  discrete subordination  uses bernstein functions to produce probability densities on @xmath0 that include laws that can be thought of as analogs of symmetric stable laws .",
    "the decay of the convolution powers of these laws can be precisely expressed and controlled in terms of the group invariant @xmath43 at  ( [ phi ] ) , and this technique is quite interesting in its own right .",
    "this idea , which the authors developed for the purpose of the present paper , is presented in detail in  @xcite .",
    "we will use some of the results of  @xcite .",
    "however , the moment properties of these subordinated laws are directly related to the rate of escape of the basic simple random walk on the underlying group . in particular , for groups with a rate of escape that is faster than the classical @xmath190 , the moment conditions satisfied by these subordinated laws are not what one would expect from a simplistic analogy with the classical case of @xmath142 .",
    "for instance , on a finitely generated group with linear rate of escape , the `` symmetric stable law '' of exponent @xmath191 [ by definition , the law obtained via discrete @xmath192-subordination from the law of simple random walk ] will only have a finite @xmath193-moment for @xmath194 ( instead of @xmath185 in the classical case ) .",
    "what this means is that , in general , upper bounds obtained by using  @xcite will not match closely the lower bounds discussed in ( 1 ) above .",
    "they will only do so if there exists a simple random walk on @xmath0 that has a rate of escape of type @xmath190 as in the classical case of @xmath142 .",
    "this is a subtle requirement since it is not known whether or not all random walks associated with finite symmetric generating sets on a given finitely generated group have the same rate of escape .",
    "there is a more elementary way to produce probability distributions with finite @xmath171-moment and whose convolution powers can be estimated .",
    "this technique goes back to  @xcite .",
    "it is revisited in section  [ sec - upvol ] .",
    "it works well for groups where the invariant @xmath43 behaves precisely as predicted by the available upper bounds based on volume growth ( e.g. , polycyclic groups ) .",
    "it does not work well for wreath products such as @xmath161 , @xmath195 .",
    "for such groups neither of the techniques in ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) produce upper bounds on @xmath189 matching the lower bounds obtained via ( 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , section  [ sec - wreath ] shows that the lower bounds obtained via ( 1 ) are essentially tight even in the case of these wreath products .",
    "this requires an ad hoc argument that takes advantage of the precise structure of these groups .",
    "this section develops the key technique that we use to obtain lower bounds on the functions @xmath2 introduced in definition  [ def1 ] , namely , comparison of dirichlet forms .",
