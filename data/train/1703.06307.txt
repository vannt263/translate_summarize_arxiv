    "derivative coordinate functions allow us to define multivalued analytic functions to represent smooth binary symmetric tree fractals as sets of partially overlapping analytical paths [ 1 ] .",
    "we found that with this formulation we can express a binary symmetric tree fractals as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the derivative coordinate functions and @xmath5 is the multivalued unit function that has values @xmath6 except at branch points when @xmath7 . under integration",
    "this generates left and right branches starting from each branch point [ 1 ] .",
    "we note that the check mark over a variable indicates that this is a fractal variable which represents a set of values that correspond to a specific position along a set of branches of the same generation .",
    "for example , the midpoint between the 3rd and 4th generation of branches is a set of @xmath8 values .",
    "we also state that such fractal variable is by definition dependent on the path variable @xmath9 and will not always specifically state the path variable . for example",
    "@xmath10 .    to simplify the notation we use the dot notation which is justified if we recognize that @xmath11 is a velocity function along the fractal paths and @xmath12 is the angular frequency , i.e. relative change of angle .",
    "so equation 1 is written as @xmath13    to remind ourselves what this represents , below is an example of a tree fractal that uses derivative coordinate functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 .     and",
    "@xmath16,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    this tree fractal was generated with the smooth tree fractal explorer [ 2 ] .",
    "using derivative coordinate functions and the formulation of analytic tree fractals , we can now develop a new geometric that is centered around the fractal paths , i.e. the branches . to facilitate the discussion ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a single branch of a smooth tree fractal and then extend this to the full tree fractal .",
    "the general definition of smooth tree fractals generates arbitrary binary symmetric tree fractals but we will limit ourselves to the most basic smooth tree fractal , such as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constant .",
    "this represents a smooth tree fractal with branches that shorten ( or lengthen ) exponentially and where the branches curl constantly .",
    "when considering a single branch , we can drop the unit branch function @xmath5 and for @xmath20 get the path function of the most right hand branch    @xmath21    we define the new geometry by introducing a coordinate pair @xmath22 with the condition that @xmath23 is perpendicular to @xmath24 , i.e. its path of progression is rotated by @xmath25 with respect to the path of progression of @xmath24 . to project a point @xmath26 on the fractal space",
    ", we first move @xmath27 in the @xmath24 direction and then in the @xmath23 direction .",
    "we can represent this as a path integral .",
    "in general we can define a point found by coordinates along a path function as    a point @xmath28 determined by coordinates @xmath29 such that @xmath24 progresses along a path @xmath30 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and then rotated by @xmath25 , continuous by @xmath23 along a path @xmath30 from @xmath32 to @xmath33 is given as @xmath34        for the fractal branch under consideration , we can substitute @xmath30 ,    @xmath35    with ( 6 ) we can now calculate any point @xmath36 with respect to the fractal .",
    "figure 2 shows a coordinate grid for whole values of @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "we have chosen the most right hand branch of the tree fractal .",
    "we can now extend this new geometry to all branches of the fractal by reintroducing the fractal function @xmath37and define the fractal space :    the fractal geometric space @xmath38 centered around a fractal @xmath39 for all coordinates @xmath29 is defined as @xmath40    using fractal functions with derivative coordinate functions , we obtain the fractal geometric space @xmath41    we are reminded that these integrals return values for each branch path as determined by specific branch instances of the unit fractal function . for example when @xmath42 , the right hand spiralling branch is generated .",
    "note the missing check mark on @xmath43 indicating that this is a path function , not a fractal function .",
    "when @xmath44 , the central right `` snaking '' path is generated .",
    "figure 3 shows an example of a the coordinate grid for the complete tree fractal .",
    "using the definition of the fractal geometric space , we can plot images of well known objects such as conics .",
    "figure 3 shows an ellipse plotted on the new geometry for the first 4 generations of all branches of an analytic tree fractal .",
    "we can see the key features of the new geometry :    * shrinkage of the scale as the ellipse progresses along the fractal .",
    "* ever sharper bending of the fractal branches point . * symmetric replication of the ellipse at each branch point , starting from a single point of at the bottom edge of an ellipse at the trunk of the tree fractal .",
    "tree fractals may turn and twist around their own branches and the geometry will follow , as shown image 4 which replicates the first few iterations of the koch curve . if anything this shows the complexity of basic shapes in a fractal geometric space .",
    "one objective in defining a fractal geometry is to study fractal functions in their canonical form , i.e. when the fractal does not branch or scale .",
    "this corresponds to the case when @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it would be more accurate to describe this as a fractal where all branches degenerate into overlapping branches .",
    "figure 5 shows the same function as in figure 3 and 4 but with the degenerate condition that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as such",
    "we see the function in its canonical form , in this case a parametric ellipse .     and @xmath46.,scaledwidth=17.0% ]",
    "from the introduction , we see that there is an overlap between the spaces of adjacent branches . depending on the values of @xmath11 and @xmath16",
    "the branches may even cross over as they loop around .    in practical applications",
    "the overlap of branch space is not always desirable . we can remove the overlap by restricting the range of the fractal function after a branch point .",
    "how the range is restricted is arbitrary and the overlap is only avoided locally but this may be sufficient from an application perspective .",
    "figure 6 shows an example where the range of two symmetric branches has been limited to avoid overlap .",
    "this geometry may be extended to higher dimensions by using the formulation of derivative coordinate functions as described in [ 1 ] .",
    "the derivative coordinate function in @xmath0 is given by    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the multi - valued cartesian fractal coordinate functions and @xmath53 , @xmath12 and @xmath54 are the derivative spherical coordinate functions of the fractal tree .",
    "following a similar argument that led to definition 2.2 and subsequently to equation 7 , we construct a path to a general fractal point @xmath55    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59 rotations in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 directions respectively .",
    "this approach may be generalized to any dimension .",
    "first we define the derivative coordinate function of a fractal tree @xmath62 in @xmath63 through a recurrence relation with respect to a fractal tree @xmath64 in @xmath65    @xmath66    where @xmath67    now that we have a definition for a fractal tree @xmath62 in @xmath63 we can define a path to a fractal point @xmath68 in @xmath63 as follows    @xmath69    where @xmath70 are @xmath59 rotations in the @xmath71 directions .    now that we have a description of the fractal point @xmath68 in @xmath63 by extension we have defined the full fractal geometric space around the smooth tree fractal @xmath37 in @xmath63 .",
    "the fractal geometric space @xmath38 centered around a fractal @xmath39 for all coordinates @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73",
    "as a geometry , this fractal geometry does nt have the intrinsically useful properties that we find in other geometries .",
    "except in the degenerate case , it is not conformal , as attested by the overlapping geometry of different branches .",
    "its main usefulness is its ability to allow us to project functions and shapes onto a smooth and continuous tree fractal space .",
    "since such fractals are very common in nature , this may provide a useful tool for studying the fundamental geometry of natural fractals .",
    "in particular it allows us to ask questions like : what would a natural form look like in its canonical form when @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    without providing evidence ,",
    "any natural tree would be reduced to a perfectly cylindrical log and leaves would be reduced to discs .",
    "river deltas would be represented as canal segments with constant water flow . that last example lifts the veil perhaps .",
    "although care needs to be taken with the transfer of quantities like flow across branch points , the entire fractal system is defined and described by the canonical form i.e. the idealized trunk , the branch `` transfer functions '' and the fractal coordinate functions @xmath11 and @xmath16 and the fractal unit function @xmath5 .    to fully make this case",
    ", we need to formalize the notion of branch node transfer functions and go beyond symmetric binary fractal trees , i.e. asymmetric n - ary fractal trees . both of these have been studied and will be the object of separate papers ."
