    "in a seminal work , @xcite predicted that the is surrounded by a tenuous , hot corona .",
    "provided that the temperature of such gas was below the escape temperature for a galaxy , he showed that the gas should extend several kiloparsecs above the midplane .",
    "spitzer s original arguments have been extended to a more general theory of the dynamical evolution of the gaseous disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "this so called `` galactic fountain '' model ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) postulates that the hot gas produced by multiple overlapping supernovae would be buoyant in the thin , cold disks of gas in spiral galaxies . as the hot gas rises from the thin disk into the halo",
    ", it cools , perhaps forming condensations of neutral material which then fall back towards the thin disk as high- or intermediate - velocity clouds .",
    "the existence of such gas in the milky way is now well documented through observations of strong absorption ( e.g. savage et al .",
    "2000 ) and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the 1032/1038 doublet transition of li - like oxygen ( ) is an important tracer of hot , collisionally ionized material . at temperatures of @xmath5k , where gas of near - solar metallicity cools most efficiently , emission from the doublet",
    "can be the primary coolant .",
    "hence , observations of emission provide a direct probe of the cooling rate of material near this temperature .",
    "furthermore , because the cooling of gas at temperatures of a few times 10@xmath6k is so much more efficient than that of material at higher ( or lower ) temperatures , emission traces rapidly cooling material that may condense into clouds in the galactic fountain scenario .",
    "observations of from this `` transition temperature '' gas in the halos of galaxies provide fundamental information on the circulation of material within spiral galaxies .",
    "an absorption line survey of the milky way @xcite showed that the observed was best explained by a patchy disk corotating with the galactic plane with signs of outflows . observed in emission in the milky way has been associated with gas in or around the local bubble ( welsh et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) and an outflow from the perseus arm ( otte , dixon , & sankrit 2003 ) . with our improving understanding of the distribution inside the milky way",
    ", it becomes necessary to search for emission in other galaxies as well in order to be able to distinguish between peculiarities and common properties of galaxies .",
    "we analyzed spectra of two galaxies ( and ) taken by the _",
    "far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. both galaxies are nearly edge - on ( i.e. allow clear distinction between disk and halo gas ) and known for strong extraplanar emission in radio continuum , optical lines , and soft x - rays ( sxr ) .",
    "thus , they appear to be good candidates to search for evidence of galactic fountains . while the spectra of ngc891 did not reveal any emission , we detected the doublet in ngc4631 .",
    "this is the first detection of in emission in a spiral galaxy other than the milky way and its companions .",
    "we obtained spectra with the low resolution aperture ( @xmath7 ) of _ fuse _ at two positions above the disk of ngc4631 ( see figure [ 4631pos ] ) as part of project p134 .",
    "position a is at the peak of the 1/4 kev x - ray emission detected by @xcite using _ rosat_. position b is between two h@xmath1 arcs that were believed to form the walls of an open chimney into the halo ( rand , kulkarni , & hester 1992 ) , although a recent _ hubble space telescope _ h@xmath1 image @xcite indicates that this feature may be a superposition of several loops .",
    "all _ fuse _ observations were conducted in ttag mode where the detectors record the arrival time , x- and y - position , and the pulse height of each event @xcite .",
    "about 2/3 of each observation was conducted during orbital night .",
    "the lines in the ngc4631 spectra were extracted from the raw data files .",
    "only events with a pulse height between 4 and 15 , inclusive , were used in the analysis .",
    "nearby airglow lines were used to determine the height of the extraction windows , and the spectra were summed perpendicular to the dispersion direction .",
    "emission free regions adjacent to the lines in the dispersion direction were used to determine the background .",
    "figure [ 4631sp ] shows a plot of the extracted spectra for both pointings toward ngc4631 .",
    "the wavelength scale was determined by running the spectra through the _ fuse _ data pipeline v2.0.5 .",
    "its uncertainty is about one pixel ( 0.007 ) .",
    "both the redshifted 1032 and 1038 line were detected on the lif1a channel .",
    "however , the latter was blended with the @xmath81039.23,1040.94,1041.69 airglow triplet .",
    "the background at wavelengths @xmath9  was increased due to a stripe of scattered light within the satellite .",
    "the emission lines were also seen on the lif2b segment for position b ; however , the lower effective area significantly reduced the quality of the data .",
    "therefore , we have used only data from the 1032 emission line of segment lif1a in the analysis .    a comparison of day - plus - night versus night - only data yielded the same flux in the @xmath101032 line and therefore ruled out the possibility that the emission arose from scattered solar emission in the lif channels .",
    "deep integrations towards other lines of sight ruled out detector artifacts , scattered light , and stray light contamination at the positions of the detected lines .",
    "the background was not significantly higher during the sunlit portion of the orbit ; therefore , we have used the combined day and night data in our analysis .",
    "the resulting signal - to - noise ratios for the integrated @xmath101032 intensities are 4.5 ( position a ) and 6.0 ( position b ) .",
    "the data for ngc891 were obtained as part of _ fuse _ guest investigator cycle 2 program b114 .",
    "two positions below the disk and one position above the bulge of ngc891 ( see figure [ 891pos ] ) were observed .",
    "the data reduction was identical to the data reduction for ngc4631 above .",
    "approximately 85% of the observations were conducted during the night portion of the orbit .",
    "the observational data for both galaxies are listed in table [ obs ] . given the large random errors in the intensities of ngc891 , we do not believe that any of these detections are significant .",
    "ngc4631 is an sc / sbd type galaxy at a distance of about 7.6mpc with an inclination of @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction between ngc4631 and its two neighboring galaxies and might have triggered the active star formation observed in ngc4631 today .",
    "the galaxy possesses a complex system of h@xmath1 filaments and bubbles @xcite and an extended radio halo with spurs up to 10kpc above the disk @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of ngc4631 revealed a sxr bubble on the north side of the disk @xcite and a halo of gas extending up to 8kpc above the plane with temperatures of @xmath12k @xcite .",
    "both the radio and the x - ray halo appear asymmetric with the larger extent being on the north side of the disk .",
    "the two _ fuse _ pointings for ngc4631 were chosen to lie within the sxr bubble observed with _",
    "( wang et al .",
    "1995 , see figure [ 4631pos ] ) .",
    "assuming an effective area of 27.0@xmath13 for the lif1a segment and 900arcs@xmath14 for the aperture area , we derive @xmath101032 intensities of @xmath15photonss@xmath4@xmath16sr@xmath4 ( position a ) and @xmath17photonss@xmath4@xmath16sr@xmath4 ( position b ) . table [ intensity ] lists the intensities ( also converted to ergss@xmath4@xmath16sr@xmath4 ) and the corresponding height above the disk .",
    "the @xmath101032 intensity at position b is a factor of five smaller than the 2@xmath18 upper limit of @xcite , who observed the southern portion of the galaxy with the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ on the astro-2 mission .",
    "the full extent of the emitting gas is unknown .",
    "however , it is useful to consider two cases . in the first scenario ,",
    "the emission is confined to the region of the sxr bubble on the north side of the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission may extend across the full hot halo revealed by the _ chandra _ observations of @xcite .",
    "the former would correspond to a single large bubble breaking out into the halo , while the latter implies a full galactic fountain .",
    "therefore , we will calculate the luminosity for both cases assuming that the average surface brightness is equivalent to the average of positions a and b. the @xmath101032/@xmath101038 line ratio approaches two in optically thin gas and is reduced in optically thick gas due to self - absorption .",
    "we assumed the upper limit for this line ratio of 2 in order to account for the @xmath101038 emission in our calculations . ignoring extinction ( see below )",
    "we calculated a lower limit for the total luminosity of @xmath19ergss@xmath4 for the bubble and @xmath20ergss@xmath4 for the entire halo .",
    "the milky way extinction toward ngc4631 is @xmath21 ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) . using a galactic extinction curve by cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 )",
    ", we derived an optical depth @xmath22 , i.e. the uv flux is attenuated by a factor of 1.28 .",
    "the corrected values for the luminosities are @xmath23ergss@xmath4 for the bubble and @xmath24ergss@xmath4 for the entire halo .",
    "the amount of extinction within ngc4631 is uncertain .",
    "long slit optical spectroscopy of the balmer lines by @xcite has revealed evidence for significant and patchy extinction due to dust in the halo of ngc4631 up to 5kpc from the plane .",
    "however , another group found almost no extinction at a height of @xmath25kpc on the northern side of the disk @xcite .",
    "we obtained long slit spectra of ngc4631 with the 2.3 m steward observatory on kitt peak , arizona , on 2002 april 79 .",
    "the slit was about @xmath26 wide and orientated north - south to cross both _",
    "fuse _ positions .",
    "the measured h@xmath1/h@xmath27 line ratios are comparable to those measured by @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that extinction within the halo of ngc4631 is negligible .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the emission is an important coolant for hot ionized gas .",
    "in fact , for gas in heating - cooling equilibrium , the emission cooling at intermediate temperatures ( few @xmath28k ) should dominate the radiative cooling in the sxr emission of @xmath29k gas @xcite .",
    "the sxr intensities in the @xmath30kev range measured by _",
    "chandra _ and integrated over the area of the _ fuse _ positions are @xmath31ergss@xmath4@xmath16sr@xmath4 ( position a ) and @xmath32ergss@xmath4@xmath16sr@xmath4 ( position b ) yielding sxr/ ratios of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for positions a and b , i.e. the intensities are more or less comparable between the doublet and the sxr emission . however , the used @xmath81032,1038 emission was a lower limit ( see paragraph [ n4631 ] ) and not corrected for galactic extinction ( because we did not know the galactic extinction for the sxr emission ) ; the sxr/ ratios did not account for any dust in ngc4631 either .",
    "thus , the quoted ratios are probably lower limits suggesting that the gas is not in equilibrium .",
    "the total luminosity ( corrected for galactic extinction , see paragraph [ ext ] ) , if assumed to cover the whole halo of ngc4631 , is by a factor of 9 lower than the two component fit of the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath35ergss@xmath4 , wang et al .",
    "1995 , corrected for different distances ) .",
    "the corresponding temperature of this x - ray luminosity was approximately @xmath36k , i.e. a temperature about twice as high as the one for the peak of the cooling curve .",
    "this again implies that the gas is not cooling efficiently in , i.e. it is not in equilibrium .",
    "however , the uncertainties here are higher than for the comparison above , as we now have compared observational data with a model using different simplifications ( e.g. for the shape and extent of the emitting halo ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that the mechanical energy input from supernovae is about @xmath37ergss@xmath4 , i.e. the observed luminosity can account for at most @xmath38% of the total energy input from supernovae . if the gas is in equilibrium , then the remaining energy input has to be used to transport the gas from the disk into the halo against the gravitational potential of the galaxy and against the pressure of the magnetic field lines and is partially lost due to cooling of @xmath39k hot gas by species other than oxygen . from the cooling flow models of @xcite , we calculate that the full halo case is equivalent to a mass flux of 2.8m@xmath40yr@xmath4 for cooling at constant density and 1.8m@xmath40yr@xmath4 for cooling at constant pressure . in case of a single cooling bubble",
    "the corresponding mass fluxes are 0.74m@xmath40yr@xmath4 ( isochoric ) and 0.48m@xmath40yr@xmath4 ( isobaric ) . a rough estimate for the mass flux derived from _ rosat _",
    "observations is @xmath41m@xmath40yr@xmath4 @xcite . despite the large uncertainties due to unknown extinction and the differences in the cooling models , the data suggest that the emitting region is larger than the sxr bubble , but smaller ( within a factor of @xmath38 ) than the x - ray halo observed with _ chandra_.",
    "this means that outflows are more significant in the central region of the galaxy , as indicated by the filamentary structure in the h@xmath1 image @xcite .",
    "if , in fact , there was strong , patchy extinction along our lines of sight , the actual luminosities could be much higher than the observed luminosities and could account for a significant fraction of the input energy from supernovae . on the other hand , if the emission originated in the interface between cold clouds moving through the hot coronal gas , the relationship between sxr and emission would become more complicated .      we fitted the observed @xmath101032 emission line by a convolution of a tophat ( 106kms@xmath4 wide to represent the filled _ fuse _ @xmath42 square aperture ) and a gaussian profile ( to represent the spectral resolution of _ fuse _ ) .",
    "we used @xmath43 calculations to determine the best central wavelengths and intrinsic velocity dispersions for the emission lines at positions a and b. in order to estimate 1@xmath18 uncertainties for these parameters , we varied each parameter independently until the corresponding minimum @xmath43 increased by 1 relative to the best fit @xmath43 .",
    "the derived values are @xmath44  and @xmath45kms@xmath4 for position a and @xmath46  and @xmath47kms@xmath4 for position b. the corresponding radial velocities ( geocentric ) are @xmath48kms@xmath4 ( position a ) and @xmath49kms@xmath4 ( position b ) .",
    "an offset of @xmath50 and @xmath51kms@xmath4 , respectively , yields local standard of rest velocities .",
    "if the emitting gas does not fill the lwrs aperture and is not centered in it , the maximum additional offset in the line centroid is 50kms@xmath4 ( for a point source at the border of the aperture ) .",
    "the line broadening due to the satellite s orbital motion is @xmath52kms@xmath4 , i.e. well within the uncertainties of the fwhm .",
    "the intrinsic fwhms , if assumed to be thermal widths , correspond to temperatures of @xmath53k ( position a ) and @xmath54k ( position b ) .",
    "these temperatures are an order of magnitude higher than the hottest component of the sxr emission .",
    "this suggests that the line widths are caused by turbulent motion or differential rotation rather than thermal motion . from position - velocity diagrams",
    "@xcite , one can expect an offset of about 50100kms@xmath4 between the systemic velocity ( 606kms@xmath4 ) and the velocity of gas corotating in the disk at the distances of the _ fuse _ positions projected onto the major axis . a combination of the size of the low resolution aperture ( 30@xmath55 or about 1.1kpc ) and differential rotation yields a velocity dispersion of up to 200kms@xmath4 in the galactic plane near the center .",
    "the velocity centroids and fwhms closely match those of the gas in the disk of ngc4631 .",
    "thus , the line - of - sight component of the motion of the emitting gas appears to follow the rotation of the underlying disk gas .",
    "due to the galaxy s high inclination , the velocity of the emitting gas perpendicular to the disk is unknown .",
    "although not conclusive , this strong relationship to the disk gas implies that the emitting material originated in the disk .      if the gas has an exponential distribution in the vertical direction above the disk , we can calculate the density scale height of the gas from the two observations at positions a and b using : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the vertical heights of the projected aperture above the plane of the galaxy , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the measured specific intensities at positions a and b , respectively . the 2 in equation [ scale_height ] results from the fact that the intensity is proportional to the square of the density . using the intensities and @xmath61 heights from table [ intensity ] , we find @xmath62 the large uncertainty in the density scale height results from the large uncertainties in the measured specific intensities at positions a and b. however , it appears that the scale height of gas in ngc4631 is significantly larger than the 2.3kpc scale height found by @xcite for the milky way . using the intensities from paragraph [ sxr ]",
    ", we find a scale height of about 6.6kpc for the sxr emission in ngc4631 , whereas hummel , beck , & dahlem ( 1991 ) reported a scale height of about 8kpc for the magnetic field .",
    "scale heights derived from optical emission lines range between 0.9 and 1.2kpc , not considering the roughly constant intensity at @xmath63kpc @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties , the scale heights of the and sxr emission and the magnetic field appear to be comparable .",
    "the sb spiral galaxy ngc891 is at a distance of about 9.6mpc with an inclination of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we observed three positions in the halo of ngc891 and did not detect in emission to a level greater than @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ 891sp ] ) .",
    "the @xmath65 intensity limits can be obtained from table [ intensity ] .",
    "the milky way extinction in this direction is @xmath66 @xcite . assuming a standard interstellar extinction curve @xcite , the uv flux is attenuated by a factor of 2.4 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "if we assume that the emitting halo of ngc891 is the same size as the x - ray emitting halo seen by @xcite , and that the average specific intensity of the halo in ngc891 is equal to the average at positions 1 and 2 , then the upper limit to the @xmath101032 luminosity is @xmath68ergss@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite found that the sxr ( 0.12.5kev ) band luminosity is @xmath69ergss@xmath4 with a cooling rate of 0.08 m@xmath40yr@xmath4 ( corrected for @xmath70mpc ) .",
    "this predicts an @xmath101032 luminosity @xcite of @xmath71ergss@xmath4 ( isochoric ) and @xmath72ergss@xmath4 ( isobaric ) , well within our limits .",
    "we have not attempted any correction for extinction in the halo of ngc891 itself .",
    "ngc4631 has a stronger radio halo than ngc891 , but a comparable far - ir luminosity .",
    "rand , kulkarni , & hester ( 1992 ) concluded from these observations that ngc4631 probably has a larger star formation rate than ngc891 .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "images of @xcite clearly show loops , arcs , and filaments as would be expected from galactic chimneys .",
    "_ rosat _ observations @xcite revealed the presence of a large region of sxr emission directly above the arcs and filaments , indicating that some of the hot supernovae gas has vented into the halo . in this paper , we reported the detection of emission at two locations above the arcs at the peaks of the sxr emission with a line - of - sight velocity similar to the disk gas and a fwhm broader than what might be expected from thermal motions of hot gas .",
    "the observation of emitting gas suggests that the hot gas originated in the disk and is cooling . due to the large uncertainties in the intensities and luminosities and the range in the luminosities and mass flux rates predicted by cooling flow models",
    ", it is not clear whether the cooling flow in ngc4631 is ( yet ) in equilibrium with the mass flux derived from x - ray observations .",
    "however , given all this evidence , we believe that , because of its edge - on nature , ngc4631 is the first spiral galaxy in which has been detected in emission unambiguously from the galactic halo and in which all the expected components for a full cycle of gas in a galactic fountain have been observed .",
    "the lack of reliable measurements for ngc891 is likely explained with the large foreground extinction of the milky way and the amount of dust in ngc891 itself .",
    "the luminosities predicted from cooling flow models are well within our 3@xmath18 limits for ngc891 .",
    "the ngc 4631 data were obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ mission operated by the johns hopkins university . financial support to u. s. participants has been provided by nasa contract nas5 - 32985 .",
