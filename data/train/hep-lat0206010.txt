    "although there has recently been interest in coulomb gauge  @xcite and generic covariant gauges  @xcite , the usual gauge for these studies has been landau gauge , because it is a ( lattice ) lorentz covariant gauge that is easy to implement on the lattice , and its popularity means that results from the lattice can be easily compared to studies that use different methods .",
    "finite volume effects and discretization errors have been extensively explored in lattice landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , lattice landau gauge suffers from the well - known problem of gribov copies . although the ambiguity originally noticed by gribov  @xcite is not present on the lattice , the maximization procedure used for gauge fixing does not uniquely fix the gauge .",
    "there are , in general , many local maxima for the algorithm to choose from , each one corresponding to a gribov copy , and no local algorithm can choose the global maximum from among them . while various remedies have been proposed  @xcite , they are either unsatisfactory or computationally very intensive . for a recent discussion of the gribov problem in lattice gauge theory , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to operate in the so - called laplacian gauge  @xcite .",
    "this gauge is `` landau like '' in that it has similar smoothness and lorentz invariance properties  @xcite , but it involves a non - local gauge fixing procedure that avoids lattice gribov copies .",

    "laplacian gauge is a nonlinear gauge fixing that respects rotational invariance , has been seen to be smooth , yet is free of gribov ambiguity .",
    "it reduces to landau gauge in the asymptotic limit , yet is computationally cheaper than landau gauge .",

    "the resulting gauge should be unambiguous so long as the nth and ( n+1)th eigenvectors are not degenerate and the eigenvectors can be satisfactorily projected onto @xmath10 . a complex @xmath21 matrix can be uniquely projected onto @xmath14 , but this is not the case for @xmath10 . here",
    "we can think of the projection method as defining its own , unambiguous , laplacian gauge fixing .    in the original formulation  @xcite , which we shall rather perversely refer to as @xmath13",
    ", the lowest @xmath22 eigenvectors are required to gauge fix an @xmath10 gauge theory .",

    "we see that @xmath33 and hence @xmath34 .",
    "when this is applied to the transformed gauge field it will be taken to exactly the same point on the gauge orbit as the original gauge field went to when gauge fixed .",
    "thus all points on the gauge orbit will be mapped to the same single point on the gauge orbit after laplacian gauge fixing and so it is a complete ( i.e. , gribov - copy free ) gauge fixing .",
    "this method was investigated for @xmath35 and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that any prescription for projecting @xmath25 onto some @xmath36 , which preserves the property @xmath34 under an arbitrary gauge transformation @xmath30 , will also be a gribov - copy free laplacian gauge fixing .",
