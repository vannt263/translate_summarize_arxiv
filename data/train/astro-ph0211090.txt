    "it has recently become apparent that traditional hydrodynamical simulations , where the gas is only allowed to heat adiabatically and through shocks , have difficulties in matching observations in the central regions of clusters , with a significant underestimation of the temperature corresponding to a given cluster mass .",
    "this is potentially important for attempts to use the observed temperature function of clusters to constrain the matter power spectrum on short scales , a topic which has been studied by many authors over the years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vl99 ) ; @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , most of which use hydrodynamical simulations to relate mass to temperature .",
    "such concerns have been given further impetus by a recent paper by @xcite , who used an observed relationship between cluster temperature and mass @xcite , rather than one derived from hydrodynamical simulations , to find a normalization for the matter power spectrum significantly lower than that of earlier works .",
    "in a recent paper ( @xcite ) we showed that the inclusion of extra gas physics , namely radiative cooling of the gas and possible preheating of the gas before cluster formation , can bring simulations into good agreement with recent _ chandra _ observations of the cores of clusters ( @xcite ) , suggesting that these may be crucial ingredients in obtaining an accurate description of clusters .    in this paper",
    ", we derive a constraint on the matter power spectrum normalization @xmath6 in a way which improves on previous work in several ways . on the theoretical side ,",
    "we incorporate the temperature  mass relationship , and its scatter , as obtained from the simulations described above . on the observational side , we compare with the data published in ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , whose raw catalogue contains around one hundred clusters , most with data from both _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca_. finally , on the data analysis side we use a novel approach , whereby monte carlo simulations are used to generate mock galaxy cluster catalogues , which through comparison with the data published in ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) lead to a simultaneous constraint on the x - ray temperature to luminosity relationship , including its scatter , and on the matter power spectrum normalization @xmath6 .",
    "the galaxy cluster catalogue containing the best available x - ray data is that compiled by ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 ) .",
    "the master catalogue contains 106 clusters , selected by their x - ray _ rosat _ flux from available cluster catalogues , with 88 among them having been observed by _",
    "asca_. imposing a flux cut in the _ rosat _ [ 0.1 , 2.4 ] kev band of @xmath7 , a flux - limited sample of 63 clusters is then obtained , called _ hiflugcs _ , which is claimed to be statistically complete ( reiprich & bhringer 2002 ) .",
    "ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) use a slightly different sample in their analysis , obtained by excluding the two lowest temperature clusters from _ hiflugcs _ , ending up with a sample of 61 clusters with x - ray temperatures ranging from 1.4 kev up to 11 kev . among these ,",
    "56 have x - ray temperatures derived by ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from _ asca _ data by means of a two - temperature model that takes into account a possible contribution from a cooler component at the cluster core .    in order to define the observed cluster sample with which to compare the artificially - generated cluster catalogues",
    ", we will impose more restrictive selection criteria on _ hiflugcs _ than ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) did .",
    "we will only consider clusters with measured x - ray flux in the [ 0.1 , 2.4 ] kev band above @xmath8 , x - ray temperature higher than 2 kev , and a redshift between 0.03 and 0.10 ( when performing tests , we found that including clusters with @xmath9 seems to lead to an increase in the best - fit @xmath10 by a few per cent ) .",
    "these ranges were chosen to maximize confidence in completeness of the sample , minimize cosmic variance , and because the luminosity  temperature relation is expected to deviate from a power law below 2 kev due to non - gravitational physics .    so that we can account for the measurement errors both in flux and temperature , which can lead to incompleteness effects when imposing either flux or temperature criteria in the sample selection procedure , we used monte carlo simulations to generate 40 realizations of the _ hiflugcs _ catalogue , with the measurement errors in flux and temperature modelled as gaussian distributed .",
    "we then imposed our cluster selection criteria , described above , on these catalogues to obtain a set of 40 observed cluster samples , with very similar but not identical numbers of clusters , representing different possible realizations of the chosen observed cluster sample .",
    "we performed extensive tests to determine the minimum number of monte carlo realizations of _ hiflugcs _ that should be generated , so as to properly account for the effect of the measurement errors on the distribution of the cluster properties , within the observed data sample which we will use to compare with the artificially - generated cluster catalogues .",
    "we found that 40 realizations are enough , and increasing their number to 200 or 1000 has a negligible effect both on the typical distribution of cluster properties and on the final probability distribution for @xmath10 .",
    "we also generated bootstrap realizations of _ hiflugcs _ , to determine whether the flux and temperature measurement errors provided by ikebe et al .  ( 2002 ) were realistic .",
    "they seem to be , given that the bootstrap realizations share the same mean statistical properties as the monte carlo ones , leading to negligible differences in the final probability distribution of @xmath10 values .",
    "finally , there does not seem to be any systematic shift in the mean statistical properties of both the monte carlo and bootstrap catalogues with relation to _ hiflugcs _ , which is reflected by the fact that our result on @xmath10 does not change even if we just apply our selection criteria to _ hiflugcs _ , and then compare the resulting cluster sample with the artificially - generated cluster catalogues .",
    "the direct simulation of x - ray cluster catalogues from hydrodynamical simulations is beyond present computational means due to the excessive number of particles required to obtain statistically - robust cluster abundances with temperatures above a few kev .",
    "instead , we appeal to the method used by holder , haiman & mohr ( 2001 ) , which is to use generalized mass functions of dark matter haloes to generate catalogues of clusters identified by their redshift and mass , and then estimate their x - ray temperatures using the mass  temperature relation of clusters in hydrodynamical simulations . with relation to previous work , the main improvement in this paper is the use of a mass  temperature relation that is drawn from simulations with more detailed models of the intracluster gas physics than have previously been implemented , and which closely match the x - ray properties of observed clusters ( thomas et al .  2002 ; muanwong et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter mtkp02 ) .      currently no standard definition of a dark matter halo exists , although it is convenient to define a halo as an overdense concentration of matter using the results of the spherical top - hat collapse model ( sthcm ; e.g.  @xcite ; although see also @xcite ) . for @xmath11 , the boundary of a halo predicted by the sthcm",
    "contains a mean internal overdensity of 18@xmath12 relative to the critical density .",
    "this result has led many authors to define haloes using an overdensity contrast of 200 ( which we take as our fiducial case ) .",
    "note that even with the current generation of x - ray satellites it is not feasible to measure spatially - resolved properties of clusters to such large radii .",
    "a comprehensive study of the mass function of cold dark matter haloes was carried out by jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter jen01 ) , who compared results from the largest @xmath1-body simulations available ( the hubble volume simulations simulated by the virgo consortium , which used sufficiently large volumes to obtain reliable abundances of haloes on scales corresponding to rich clusters of galaxies ) to the mass function predicted by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the simulated mass function predicts a lower abundance of haloes at low masses than the press  schechter function , but a higher abundance at high masses .",
    "although they did not investigate the cause of this discrepancy , they pointed out that the press  schechter _ ansatz _ that all mass is contained in bound objects is untrue in the simulations for conventional halo definitions .",
    "jen01 produced fits to simulated mass functions using two different estimators : the spherical - overdensity ( so ) and friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithms .",
    "the first case , as implemented by @xcite , finds and ranks the densest dark matter particles and , starting from the densest , grows a sphere until the mean internal density equals some multiple of the critical density , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "particles within this halo are then removed from the list and the procedure is repeated until all haloes are found down to a given mass limit . the fof algorithm @xcite links particles together using a fixed linking length of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean particle density .",
    "fof does not impose spherical symmetry on the shapes of the haloes ( which are typically triaxial ) but can sometimes link together haloes which are in close proximity .",
    "it is important to use a consistent definition for cluster masses to define both the mass function and the mass  temperature relation : failure to do so can lead to errors of 10 per cent in the derived value of @xmath6 .",
    "a further result from the jen01 analysis was that the mass functions , when expressed as a function of @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the generalization of @xmath6 to any mass - scale ) , are independent of cosmology if haloes are defined using either a fixed linking length ( e.g. @xmath19 ) in the fof case or defining the spherical - overdensity threshold with respect to the mean background density ( e.g. @xmath20 ) in the so case .",
    "this was confirmed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter evr02 ) , who also provided fits ( as a function of @xmath21 ) to simulated mass functions using a so algorithm with @xmath22 ( i.e. overdensity measured with respect to the critical density ) . for this paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath23 as the fiducial definition of cluster mass , and use the evr02 fits to estimate the mass function at different @xmath24 .",
    "we have checked that our method for measuring cluster masses from the simulations ( required for the calibration of the mass  temperature relation ) produces almost identical results to the so method used by jen01 and evr02 ( the median difference in halo masses is less than 0.5 per cent ) .      in this section ,",
    "we use results drawn from simulations carried out using the hydra /hydrodynamics code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) on the cray t3e computer at the edinburgh parallel computing centre as part of the virgo consortium programme of investigations into structure formation in the universe .",
    "details of the method and choice of simulation parameters were discussed by mtkp02 ; we summarize details pertinent to the results of this paper below .",
    "we adopt the currently - favoured @xmath0cdm cosmological model , setting the density parameter @xmath25 , cosmological constant @xmath26 , baryon density @xmath27 , hubble parameter @xmath28 and linear power spectrum shape parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide constraints on @xmath6 and so it may seem premature to pick one particular value for our simulations .",
    "however , the mass  temperature relation of clusters is largely independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the simulations presented in mtkp02 use @xmath30 ; we have subsequently repeated one of the simulations with a lower normalization , @xmath31 , and find an identical relation within the uncertainties .",
    "mtkp02 presented 3 simulations which differed in the way in which the gas was heated and cooled . in the first simulation ,",
    "non - radiative _ model , the gas could undergo heating by adiabatic compression and shocks but could not cool radiatively .",
    "consequently , the resulting clusters are far too luminous for their mass and so do not agree with observed x - ray scaling relations ( mtkp02 ) .",
    "we do not use results from this simulation .    in the _ radiative _ simulation",
    ", gas was able to cool radiatively using the collisional ionization equilibrium tables of @xcite .",
    "cooled material was permitted to form stars , removing low - entropy material with short cooling times from the centres of the clusters . finally ,",
    "in the _ preheating _ simulation ( which also includes cooling ) , the specific thermal energy of the gas was raised by 1.5 kev per particle at @xmath32 , to crudely model the effects of energy injection by galactic winds .",
    "both models reproduce key x - ray cluster scaling relations at @xmath33 , although the former predicts too much cooled gas ( i.e.  stars and galaxies ) compared to observations and the latter too little .",
    "we estimate the x - ray temperature of each cluster by weighting the contribution from each hot gas ( @xmath34k ) particle by its bolometric flux @xmath35 here , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the mass , density and temperature of the particles , @xmath39 is their metallicity and @xmath40 is the bolometric cooling function from @xcite .",
    "adopting a soft - band cooling function ( appropriate for _ rosat _ observations ) makes no significant difference to the estimated temperature .",
    "many clusters show enhanced emission from the cluster core that has a lower temperature than the cluster mean ( mtkp02 ) .",
    "for this reason , we present results for the mass  temperature relation both including and excluding the x - ray emission from within the ` cooling radius ' , defined as the radius within which the mean cooling time of the gas is 6gyr .",

    "this mainly results from the different resolutions of the simulations ( though in the case of emn96 their method of temperature estimation also plays a part ) .",
    "also , on average , at fixed temperature the cluster masses in table  [ tab : mtsim ] are higher than those in table  1 .",
    "this is due to the absence of radiative cooling ; cluster cores are full of dense , cold gas with short cooling times and this leads to low emission - weighted temperatures .",

    "we then exclude from the 1000 mock catalogues any cluster whose x - ray temperature does not exceed 2 kev .    to compare our simulated catalogues with the data we still need to impose the chosen flux selection criterion , which forces us to use a relation between x - ray luminosity ( in the [ 0.1 , 2.4 ] kev rest - frame band ) and temperature . in order to be consistent",
    ", we determine this relation from the data simultaneously with @xmath6 ( see also diego et al .",
    "we take it to be a power - law of the form @xmath60 with a dispersion @xmath61 taken to be independent of temperature , and construct a grid of values ( with dimensions @xmath62 ) of the normalization @xmath63 , slope @xmath64 and dispersion . for each point in this grid , and for every one of the 1000 catalogues available for each @xmath6 , we create 50 realizations of the luminosity ( extensive tests have shown that such number is enough to lead to a dense coverage of the range of possible luminosity distributions , and increasing the number of realizations to e.g. 200 had a negligible effect on the final probability distribution for @xmath10 ) for every cluster by randomly drawing from a gaussian distribution in ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) with the appropriate mean and dispersion .",

    "we took into account that their assumed normalization for the cluster mass ( @xmath23 ) to x - ray temperature relation ( estimated as if @xmath100 ) is somewhat higher , such that for a 3 kev cluster they assume a cluster mass around 4 per cent higher than we , while at 6 kev the difference increases to 13 per cent , as well as the fact that they do not take into account a possible dispersion in the cluster x - ray temperature at fixed mass .",
    "a most probable value of @xmath101 was obtained by applying our procedure , with good agreement also found for the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath61 . given that some differences remain between the two analysis , our results thus seem to be consistent with those of ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    in order to determine which type of information in the data is driving the results , we determined the most probable values for the four parameters under consideration by applying in isolation the 2d kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test to the three available distributions of cluster properties  ( @xmath68 ) , ( @xmath69 ) and ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is essentially unconstrained by the ( @xmath69 ) distribution .",
    "all the information comes from the two others , with the ( @xmath70 ) distribution being slightly more constraining than the ( @xmath68 ) one .",
    "consistently , the former prefers @xmath102 as the most probable value for @xmath6 , while the latter settles for @xmath103 .",
    "the information on the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath61 is roughly equally distributed amongst the three distributions , though again ( @xmath70 ) and ( @xmath104 ) are always the most and least constraining respectively , and when taken in isolation all three distributions lead to very similar results .    in fig .",
    "4 we compare the cluster properties between a realization of the _ hiflugcs _ sub - sample selected for the analysis , the mock sample that most resembles it , generated for the most probable set of parameters , and the underlying cluster population .",
    "notice that the incompleteness of the flux - limited samples increases considerably as the cluster x - ray temperature gets lower , so that below a x - ray temperature of about 5 kev we can conclude that _ hiflugcs _ is vastly incomplete .",
    "our analysis is for @xmath3 , being the value for which the large hydrodynamical simulations were run .",
    "the spectacular recent results from wmap ( bennett et al .  2003 ;",
    "spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) are consistent with this , but their best - fit is somewhat lower at @xmath4 .",
    "while we are unable to run new large simulations , we can predict the effect on @xmath6 using the scaling found in earlier analyses .",
    "vl99 found that for flat cosmologies @xmath105 , and using this scaling we obtain a best - fit @xmath6 of 0.88 for @xmath4 .",
    "given the small range over which this scaling is needed , the fractional uncertainty in @xmath6 should be unchanged .",
    "to set the context for the following discussion , we first remind the reader of the constraint from vl99 , which for @xmath106 gave @xmath107 within [ 0.73 , 1.12 ] at 95 per cent confidence . by contrast , in seljak ( 2002 ) a value of @xmath108 was obtained , based on the cluster mass to x - ray temperature relation derived in finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from cluster data .",
    "the calculation of @xmath6 performed in this paper is substantially different from that carried out in vl99 : the semi - analytical modelling featured a change in the normalization of the assumed cluster mass  temperature relation and in the shape of the assumed cluster mass function ; a different observational dataset was used ; and the method of estimating @xmath6 from monte carlo simulations differed from the previous likelihood - type calculation , where no dispersion in the cluster relations was considered .",
    "although , the most probable value for @xmath6 is quite different in both cases , the 95 per cent confidence intervals happen to be very similar .    in order to find the most important factors behind the different results",
    ", we ran several monte carlo simulations .",
    "firstly , we found that the inclusion of dispersion in the mass  temperature relation at the level considered in this paper does not seem to make much difference .",
    "secondly , and more surprisingly , we found that replacing the evr02 mass function with the press ",
    "schechter or the jenkins et al .",
    "( 2002 ) mass function also changes the most probable value for @xmath6 by less than two per cent .",
    "this appears in contradiction with claims in the literature , including our own ( wu 2001 ; pierpaoli et al .",
    "2001 ; viana et al .",
    "2002 ) , that the choice of mass function can change @xmath6 by five to ten percent .",
    "however that statement is only true if one keeps the mass  temperature relationship unchanged , but in fact these different mass functions refer to different masses ; evr02 gives the number density of haloes with mass @xmath23 , press ",
    "schechter uses the virial mass which for the cosmology assumed here is about @xmath109 , and the jen01 mass function corresponds to @xmath110 for the same cosmology .",
    "if we use the nfw cluster density profile to scale these mass functions to the same mass definition ( e.g.  the virial mass ) , most of the difference in @xmath6 disappears .",
    "we note however that this similarity of results may be specific to the cosmology adopted here .    a change that does make a difference is that , as compared to vl99 , this paper uses a much lower normalization of the cluster mass to x - ray temperature relation . so that we could determine the influence of such normalization on our results , and be able to compare them more easily with others , we calculated the dependence of the most probable @xmath6 on the value of the assumed present - day mass ( @xmath111 ) of a 5 kev cluster ( approximately the median temperature of the _ hiflugcs _ sub - sample we work with ) .",
    "taking the index of the cluster mass to x - ray temperature relation to be the standard 1.5 , we found @xmath112 note that in our main calculation we assumed @xmath113 , for an index of 1.54 .",
    "given that in vl99 it was assumed @xmath114 , we obtain @xmath115 as the value we would expect from vl99 if the only significant difference between the analyses was that change in the normalization . comparing with the vl99 value of @xmath116",
    ", this seems to be correct , with the _ hiflugcs _ sub - sample we consider favouring just a slightly higher normalization than the henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) dataset used in vl99 .",
    "although it is difficult to untangle all the competing effects , we suspect that together the new analysis method and the _ hiflugcs _ dataset allow for a much better estimate of incompleteness which would help explain why they favour a higher normalization .    turning to comparison with other work ,",
    "the reason why seljak ( 2002 ) obtained a significantly smaller value for @xmath6 with relation to vl99 ( to which it is more easily compared ) , is the assumption at fixed cluster temperature of a mass that is about 2.4 times lower than that assumed in vl99 , though this effect is mitigated by seljak s assumed local cluster abundance at about 6 kev ( from pierpaoli et al .",
    "2001 ) which was higher than that of vl99 . in this paper",
    "we too have a cluster mass at 6 kev which is much smaller than vl99 , but the reduction is by a smaller factor of 1.6 .    as we were completing this work , a paper by pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) appeared in which a similar analysis to ours and that in ikebe et al .  ( 2002 ) was carried out .",
    "the observed cluster sample is also derived from _",
    "hiflugcs _ , but otherwise they use a different approach to obtain constraints on @xmath6 . while both here and in ikebe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) it is attempted to constrain @xmath6 simultaneously with the x - ray temperature to luminosity relation , in pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) such a relation is assumed _ a priori _ ( to be that given by expression  3 in ikebe et al .",
    "we have attempted to reproduce the constraint obtained for @xmath6 by pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) when they derive the observed cluster sample just from _ hiflugcs_. such a constraint can be read from the full line in figs .  4 and 5 of pierpaoli et al .",
    "concentrating on the case of @xmath25 , and performing an analysis equivalent to that in pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , taking care to make the same assumptions and apply the selection criteria in the same manner , but using the 2d - ks method instead , we found a most probable value for @xmath6 and the 90 per cent confidence interval very similar to theirs ( a slight overestimation by @xmath117 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we just change in our own analysis the cluster mass to x - ray temperature relation so that @xmath118 at present and its index to 1.5 , as in pierpaoli et al .  ( 2003 ) , the result for @xmath6 is again very similar ( about @xmath119 ) to that obtained in pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . clearly , the most significant factor leading to the different _ hiflugcs _ based result obtained here and in pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) regarding @xmath6 , is the difference in the normalization of the cluster mass to x - ray temperature relation .",
    "our results do not indicate a dramatic reduction in @xmath6 derived from the abundance of x - ray clusters .",
    "several other recent analyses have favoured low @xmath6 , for instance from 2df and cmb data ( efstathiou et al .",
    "2002 ; lahav et al .",
    "2002 ) , from using weak lensing to estimate cluster masses ( viana et al .",
    "2002 ) , and from the local x - ray cluster luminosity function ( allen et al .",
    "2002 ) , but those are at least marginally compatible with our present result given the uncertainties .",
    "indeed , results from wmap have forced a modest increase in estimates of @xmath6 via cmb data ( spergel et al .",
    "our estimated value for @xmath6 is compatible with all published weak lensing measurements ( e.g bacon et al .",
    "2002 ; hkstra et al .",
    "2002 ; refregier , rhodes & groth 2002 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2002 ) , though only marginally with the very low results of brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , hamana et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and jarvis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as well as at the other extreme with that of maoli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    in the near future ,",
    "a decrease in the uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath6 from x - ray clusters could come from essentially two sources . on the theoretical side",
    ", it would be important to reliably estimate the x - ray luminosity of clusters using hydrodynamical @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "this would enable one to bypass the x - ray temperature as the cluster mass estimator .",
    "though temperature is more reliable , it ends up not being as useful as it could be due to the fact that all cluster catalogues are flux - limited instead of temperature selected , so an estimation of the cluster x - ray flux always needs to be made . on the observational side , both an improvement in the temperature determination and an increase in the range of redshift probed ( i.e. a decrease in the x - ray flux detection limit ) would help bring down the uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath6 .",
    "hopefully , both can be achieved with the x - ray satellites _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. in particular , it is expected that the serendipitous cluster survey _ xcs _ ( romer et al .",
    "2001 ) to be assembled with _",
    "xmm - newton _ data will help greatly in both issues .",
