    "the mf calculations , the ed simulations and the rg analysis all predict a spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry in the ground state , that is characterized by the nesting vector @xmath0 .",
    "the ground state is twofold degenerate as there are two types of crossed plaquettes ( `` strong '' and `` weak '' plaquettes ) .",
    "these ground states can be approximatively described as product states of localized two - particle states on the `` strong '' plaquettes , which are equal amplitude superpositions of a singlet wave function on each of the six bonds . in this way",
    "the two electrons forming a singlet gain the magnetic energy @xmath134 and the kinetic energy @xmath135 .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a third electron on the crossed plaquette which would cost a n.n .",
    "repulsion energy @xmath136 is avoided .",
    "therefore , the bow instability is a cooperative effect that results from a simultaneous optimization of kinetic and interaction energy .",
    "note , that for negligible kinetic energy ( @xmath137 ) other phases can be realized on the quarter - filled checkerboard lattice . and",
    "@xmath138 , where the constraint of two particles per crossed plaquette allows only states where occupied sites form closed ( or infinite ) loops on the checkerboard lattice . for @xmath72",
    "all these states are degenerate but for finite @xmath11 the states , where all loops have the minimal length four , are ground states , as the magnetic energy per electron for the loops of length four is minimal .",
    "the closed loops of four electrons around open plaquettes can be placed in a periodic pattern where the centers of the loops are connected by the vectors @xmath139 ( cf .",
    "[ app : weakcoupling ] ) .",
    "note , that in this periodic arrangement all four electron plaquettes on a diagonal can simultaneously slide along a diagonal line by @xmath140 or @xmath141 at no energy cost .",
    "therefore , the ground state is in fact infinitely degenerate .",
    "] an interesting issue for further theoretical studies are the properties and the excitations of the weakly doped bow phase , e.g. , the question whether the additional holes or particles pair and lead to a superconducting phase where the u(1 ) gauge symmetry and the translation symmetry are simultaneously broken .    in conclusion with the discovery and the description of the bow phase on the quarter - filled checkerboard lattice",
    "we show how a strongly frustrated system can avoid the local frustration at fractional filling by exploiting the bipartite arrangement of larger units .",
    "we hope that with our work we can stimulate further progress in the challenging and exciting field of strongly correlated electrons on frustrated lattices .",
