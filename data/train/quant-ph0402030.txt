    "the non relativistic scattering theory , and in particular the partial wave expansion method , is a very well known issue .",
    "an extensive literature @xcite exists in this subject . in the relativistic case , however , the scattering problem with a potential , has almost not been discussed .",
    "this has to do , probably , with the fact that relativistic quantum mechanics is , in fact , a theory of many particles and , therefore , quantum field theory is a more appropriate language to discuss these kind of problems .",
    "we think , however , that the scattering problem in the frame of the dirac equation deserves some attention .",
    "this fact has motivated us to make use of a simple mathematical method , valid for central potentials , the so called _ relativistic partial wave expansion method _ provides us with valuable information for relativistic particles near the low energy limit , giving us also values for the phase shifts and cross section of the scattered wave for different channels of the angular momentum .",
    "this method will be used to complement the work done in @xcite , a discussion for bound states in the presence of a delta potential , which shows how to fix the boundary conditions for the wave function when crossing the @xmath0 potential .",
    "we will like to remark that there are general treatments for boundary conditions for this kind of singular potentials , in the frame of the construction of self adjoint extensions for the dirac hamiltonian @xcite .    in this work we use the relativistic partial wave expansion method with the boundary conditions mentioned above , making a simple analysis for the scattering states .",
    "moreover , we will also introduce a double delta potential of the form @xmath1 .",
    "the idea is to discuss the behavior of the differential and total cross section when we vary the energy of the incident particles , analyzing the occurrence of certain resonances in different channels .",
    "we also find a useful relationship between the phase shifts and the total cross section .",
    "this work is complemented with the use of the born approximation , that gives us a more general perspective of this problem .",
    "as it is extremely well known , asymptotically , we expect that the wave function in the non relativistic case will behave as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the momentum .",
    "the differential cross section is then @xmath4    for scattering at high energies of 1/2-spin particles , we must consider the dirac equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the usual @xmath8 dirac matrices , and @xmath9 is the four - component dirac spinor .    we know that for a free particle , the one dimensional solution of the above equation is @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "when working with a spherical symmetric potential it is better to transform the dirac equation into spherical coordinates @xcite , where the complete set of commuting operators is given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total angular momentum and @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22    the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath19 are given by @xmath23    if we parametrize the four - component spinor by separating the radial and angular dependence according to the ansatz @xmath24 where @xmath25 being @xmath26 are the appropriate glebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath21 operator satisfies the following relationship with the angular momentum - spin function @xmath27    for the two different coupling , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the eigenvalues are given by @xmath30    the dependence of @xmath19 on the eigenvalues of the angular momentum will be extremely important for our calculations .",
    "everything will be function of @xmath31 .",
    "however , in the future we will replace @xmath19 with the respective @xmath32 remembering the existence of the ls coupling .",
    "we notice that : @xmath33 and @xmath34    the dirac equation in spherical coordinates has the form @xmath35    the solution of this equation for a free particle with the ansatz given in ( [ ansatz ] ) is : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the regular and irregular bessel functions respectively .",
    "here we will present the relativistic wave expansion method .",
    "the reader can see the details in @xcite .",
    "this method shows us how to calculate the differential and total cross section just by knowing the phase shift of the scattered wave .",
    "let us consider the asymptotic behavior of a 1/2-spin scattered wave @xmath42    to be able to find the effects of the scattering in the spin of the particle , we must first notice that not all the components of the spinor that represents the free particle are independent , which , in turns , allows us to see that not all the @xmath43 components are independent .",
    "for example if we have a spin parallel to the direction of incidence ( spin up ) , we have : @xmath44 @xmath45    now , if the spin is anti - parallel to the direction of incidence ( spin down ) we have @xmath46 @xmath47    the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are called _ scattering amplitudes _ ( similar to the non relativistic case ) .",
    "with these amplitudes we can calculate the differential cross section for a non polarized beam , making the change @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 getting @xmath53 where the new scattering amplitudes are given by @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56+l[\\exp{(2i\\eta^{-}_{l})}-1]\\},\\ ] ] @xmath57.\\ ] ]    we can see that the differential cross section has a direct dependence on the phase shifts of the wave function .",
    "the notation @xmath58 gives us the dependence of the wave function on the angular momentum and on the two different coupling ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "it is easy to calculate the total cross section , just by integrating the differential cross section , obtaining @xmath60",
    "as we mentioned before , we will apply the wave expansion method to a spherical potential given by @xmath61    to be able to find the phase shifts , in order to obtain the differential and total cross section , we must use the boundary conditions described in @xcite : @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 y @xmath65 are the solutions of the dirac equation outside the potential ( @xmath66 ) , and @xmath67 y @xmath68 are the solutions inside the potential ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "@xmath70 is an dimensionless constant that involves the constant @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the first boundary condition tells us that the absolute value of a function with real part @xmath73 and imaginary part @xmath74 is constant , which is nothing but the continuity of the probability density .",
    "the second boundary condition will be essential to calculate the phase shifts .",
    "first we must find the solution of the dirac equation in all regions of space .",
    "since we are dealing with a delta type potential , it will only influence the wave function in the support @xmath75 , being , therefore , the solution is the same as in the free particle case . separating the space in two regions :    i.- for @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78    the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 do not appear in the above equation , because the wave function must remain finite at the origin .",
    "ii.- for @xmath66 @xmath81 @xmath82    here we have written @xmath83 and @xmath84 as the phase shifts of the scattered wave .",
    "these phase shifts can be found using the boundary conditions .",
    "equation ( [ condeborde1 ] ) does not give us much valuable information .",
    "it only allows us to find the constant @xmath85 in the wave functions .",
    "we will concentrate on the second boundary condition ( [ condeborde2 ] ) . here",
    "the constant @xmath85 disappear , leaving us @xmath86 as the only variable .",
    "a simple algebra gives us : @xmath87 where @xmath88    the spherical bessel functions can be obtained through the following recurrence relations @xcite : @xmath89 @xmath90    ) , @xmath91 ( solid curve ) , @xmath92 ( dotted curve ) , @xmath93 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the super @xmath94 index corresponds to the different angular momentum - spin couplings , the sub index indicates the angular momentum channel .",
    "here we use @xmath95 and @xmath96    the undulatory behavior for the phase shifts in figure 1 shows the typical dependence on the bessel functions . notice the occurrence of discontinuities in each angular momentum channel , for certain value of energy .",
    "this discontinuities , which we will identify as resonances , appear when the @xmath86 get the value @xmath97 , with @xmath98 a natural number . in our work",
    "we will only discuss the case where @xmath99 .",
    "however , we will see that this resonances in the phase shifts , will not affect the cross section .",
    "now , using the results of the phase shifts , we can find an expression for the differential and total cross section using the equations ( [ sigmadiferencial ] ) and ( [ sigamtotal ] ) for different values of the angular momentum .",
    "figure 2 shows the total cross section for different values of the energy . here",
    "@xmath100 is the sum of @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the sum of @xmath103 ( see equation ( [ sigamtotal ] ) ) .    ) , @xmath104 ( solid curve ) , @xmath105 ( dashed curve ) , @xmath106 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "here we use @xmath95 and @xmath107 ]    we first notice that those resonances in the phase shift analysis do not seem seem to have any consequences in the total cross section , in spite on their direct influence in equation ( [ sigamtotal ] ) .",
    "this has to do with the fact that the resonances in the phase shifts appear at different values of energies .",
    "the cross section vanishes smoothly for high energies . for low energies ( near @xmath108 ) the dominant channel of the angular momenta is @xmath109 ( as expected ) .",
    "it is also important to mention that if we increase the delta radius or the coupling constant @xmath71 from the potential , the total cross section decreases and vanishes faster when we increase the energy .",
    "let us consider a two concentric delta potential : @xmath110    we will carry out the same procedure as before . we separate the space into three regions , finding the corresponding solution of the dirac equation .",
    "our potential will only affect us when @xmath111 and , hence , the solutions are the same as for a free particle :    \\1 ) for @xmath112 @xmath77 @xmath113    \\2 ) for @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116    \\3 ) for @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119    using the boundary conditions for each delta and having in mind that @xmath120 and @xmath121 , we can find an expression for the phase shifts : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124    in equation ( [ pikoro ] ) all bessel functions depend only on @xmath125 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath126 is concentrated on the function @xmath127 as shown on ( [ goku ] ) .",
    "now , if we choose @xmath128 or @xmath129 the problem , and hence the solution , reduces to a one delta potential .    knowing the phase shifts for a two - delta potential , we can obtain an expression for the total cross section .",

    "here we use @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 ]    again we can see that the resonances of the phase shifts do not have any notorious influence on the total cross section , in the same way as happened for a one delta potential .",
    "it decays smoothly to zero for high energies . for small energies , near @xmath108 ,",
    "the dominant angular momentum is the @xmath109 channel .",
    "once again , we must remember that @xmath100 stands for the sum of @xmath101 , and @xmath102 stands for the sum of @xmath103 .",
    "let us remember our potential @xmath134    following the same steps shown in itzykson - zuber @xcite ( equation 2 - 126 ) , we get for the scattering amplitude : @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",

    "@xmath147    using the fact that @xmath148 and @xmath149 we obtain @xmath150    since we are interested in the cross section for a non polarized beam , we must sum over all @xmath70 and @xmath151 that appear on the function @xmath152 , this means @xmath153    we will concentrate directly on the sum over @xmath70 and @xmath151 .",

    ". one important thing to notice , when working with the partial wave method , we focus on different channels of the angular momentum .",
    "but , however , we take the sum of all the angular momenta in the born approximation .",

    "we must notice that the factor @xmath94 is not taken into account .",
    "as before we realized that there will be no influence on the results if both delta potentials are repulsive or attractive .",
    "the case where the sign of @xmath85 is different from the sign of @xmath83 will also not give new information .",

    "figure 4 shows the dependence of the total cross section while we vary the energy of the particles .",
    "we notice that the total cross section has the same behavior found in the partial wave method . on the other hand",
    "if we take a @xmath172 , we can see that the behavior is again similar to the one we found in the partial wave method .    ) with the born approximation .",

    ", we were unable to find geometric conditions related to the separation of the two delta potentials , and the possible occurrence of resonances as peaks in the total cross section .",
    "the general idea of this work was to use the boundary conditions obtained in @xcite , when working with delta type singular potentials , in particular for a spherical potential like @xmath175 in the scattering region .",
    "we studied the behavior of the phase shifts , the differential and total cross section .",
    "we found a direct relation between the phase shifts of the scattered wave and the cross section . with this",
    "we were able to calculate values of the cross section for different angular momentum channels , giving us valuable information , in particular , the dependence of the cross section on the @xmath109 channel in the low energy limit .",
    "it is important to notice that the behavior of the cross sections for each channel of the angular momenta is very similar for repulsive and attractive potentials , in the one and two delta cases .",
    "we confirmed our results through the calculation of the cross section within the born approximation .",
    "this method does not require the knowledge of the boundary conditions , but it does not give us information about the angular momenta of the particles .",
