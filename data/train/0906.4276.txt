    "in the realm of quantum many - body systems the atomic nucleus poses unique challenges that do not appear in the theoretical description of other systems .",
    "one of them results from the fact that the nucleus is a finite self - bound system . unlike , e.g.",
    ", the many - electron systems in atomic , molecular , and condensed matter physics , and chemistry , in which the binding originates from an external potential created by much heavier atomic nuclei that define a reference frame , the nucleus is bound solely by the interactions between the constituent nucleons without any external confinement .    in the exact theory , the many - body state @xmath3 of the nucleus factorizes into the intrinsic state @xmath4 and a state @xmath5 describing the dynamics of the center - of - mass ( cm ) , @xmath6 only this complete decoupling guarantees that the intrinsic state of the nucleus is translationally invariant and , as result , that all intrinsic observables are free of spuriousities induced by the cm state of the system .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath4 is governed solely by the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the intrinsic kinetic energy and @xmath9 is the nuclear interaction .    generally , the wave function factorization given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : decoupling ] ) no longer holds in approximate calculations .",
    "one way to enforce it is through the use of jacobi coordinates , as in , e.g. , the translationally invariant formulation of the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite , the hyperspherical harmonics approach @xcite , and , implicitly , also the green s function monte carlo method @xcite . due to the computational complexity ,",
    "these approaches are limited to small few - body systems .",
    "for this reason , most approaches aimed at heavier nuclei adopt some finite - dimensional model space spanned by slater determinants constructed with a single - particle basis set , such as the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis .",
    "generally , the individual slater determinants are not translationally invariant and most model spaces do not restore this invariance automatically , i.e. , the solution of the many - body problem for @xmath10 leads to states with a coupling between intrinsic and cm motions which is induced by and depends on the structure of the model space .",
    "the one exception is the @xmath2 space of ncsm @xcite . for a slater - determinant basis of ho single - particle states truncated with respect to the ho excitation energy @xmath11",
    "there exists a unitary mapping onto a jacobi - coordinate basis .",
    "thus , the exact factorization of eq . is possible in the @xmath2 space . for other single - particle bases or model - space truncations ,",
    "the factorization is lost and a coupling of intrinsic and cm states emerges . in this communication , we provide a quantitative analysis of the cm contamination in the truncated _ ab initio _",
    "configuration interaction ( ci ) and coupled - cluster ( cc ) calculations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "because a direct analysis of the ci and cc wave functions with respect to the factorization given by eq . is not feasible , we need a practical tool to assess the degree of unphysical coupling between intrinsic and cm motions resulting from the truncations used in the ci and cc calculations . a stringent yet simple probe can be proposed based on replacing @xmath10 entering the ci and cc calculations by @xmath12 which includes a hamilton - type operator @xmath13 acting exclusively on the cm part of the many - body state of interest , with parameter @xmath14 controlling its strength . in principle , any operator depending on the cm position @xmath15 and momentum @xmath16 , with a spectrum bounded from below ,",
    "could be used for this purpose , but we further require that the exact ground state of @xmath13 can be represented in the model space .",
    "thus , in a ground - state calculation with @xmath17 for non - zero @xmath14 the cm is in its exact ground state if the corresponding many - body wave function @xmath18 factorizes .    for calculations based on slater determinants of ho single - particle states ,",
    "an operator which meets these requirements is @xmath19 as was first adopted by palumbo @xcite as well as gloeckner and lawson @xcite in the context of the cm problem in the valence - space shell model @xcite . in an @xmath2 space , the lowest @xmath20 eigenstates ( including both parities ) of @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmhamiltonian ] ) , are reproduced exactly .",
    "hence , as long as the @xmath21 space is a subspace of the model space used in the ci or cc calculation , the solution of the @xmath13 eigenvalue problem leads to the exact cm ground - state energy , which is zero by construction . for a closed - shell nucleus , the use of the @xmath22 determinant as a reference state guarantees this .    by solving the schr \" odinger equation for @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonianmod ] ) , using different @xmath14 values we can determine to what extent the intrinsic and cm components of the many - body wave function of interest are coupled .",
    "if a given many - body method leads to a factorized state @xmath23 , as in eq . , the intrinsic component @xmath4 and the intrinsic observables become independent of @xmath14 . in this case , the @xmath24 part of @xmath17 can only affect the cm component of @xmath23 , which has no effect on intrinsic properties .",
    "however , if the many - body scheme used to solve the schr \" odinger equation for @xmath23 can not factorize intrinsic and cm motions , the intrinsic observables , most notably the expectation value of @xmath10 , will acquire an unphysical dependence on @xmath14 . to quantify the strength of this unphysical coupling and its impact on the intrinsic energy , we need to monitor the expectation value @xmath25 computed with the eigenstates @xmath18 of @xmath17 . a necessary condition for the wave function factorization given by eq .",
    "is that @xmath25 is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we adopt the change of the intrinsic energy , @xmath26 , when going from @xmath27 to a finite @xmath14 , as a _ primary criterion _ for assessing the cm contamination in the wave function .",
    "this criterion provides a quantitative measure of the impact of the cm contamination on the intrinsic energy , while identifying states @xmath23 that factorize according to eq . which satisfy @xmath28 .    as a _ secondary criterion _ we use the expectation value of @xmath13 obtained for non - zero values of @xmath14 .",
    "if a given ground - state calculation allows for a factorization of the wave function , we can expect @xmath29 to be _ exactly _ equal to the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath13 , i.e. , zero in the case of @xmath13 defined by eq . .",
    "the non - zero @xmath29 value at a finite @xmath14 indicates a coupling of cm and intrinsic motions .",
    "we must emphasize , however , that the use of @xmath29 alone is treacherous , since it does not provide any quantitative measure of the effect of the coupling of the intrinsic and cm motions on intrinsic properties .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath13 at @xmath27 , which is sometimes used to judge the magnitude of cm contamination in approximate many - body calculations , does not provide any quantitative information , since @xmath30 can assume any positive value when the calculated wave function @xmath23 is factorizable .",
    "we use @xmath17 , eq . , solely for probing the spurious cm coupling at moderate @xmath14 values , although its original use as a way to eliminate the cm contamination was tied to large values of @xmath14 ( @xmath31 ) @xcite . in a ci calculation , the use of @xmath17 with large @xmath14 amounts to a projection of the model space onto the largest embedded @xmath2 space . in comparison to ncsm , this approach is inefficient and numerically problematic .",
    "we employ the above diagnostics to analyze cm contaminations in _ ab initio _ ci and cc calculations , which rely on the model spaces spanned by slater determinants constructed from the ho single - particle states that satisfy the condition @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the principal quantum number , i.e. , model spaces that violate translational invariance from the outset .",
    "the first method we consider is the importance - truncated ci ( it - ci ) approach introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the ci eigenvalue problem in the above model space is further reduced through the use of an importance measure for the individual many - body basis states derived from perturbation theory .",
    "we focus on the it - ci approach with up to @xmath34 excitations from the initial reference state @xmath35 [ it - ci(@xmath34 ) ] , which for the closed - shell nuclei examined in this work is the determinant obtained by occupying the @xmath36 lowest single - particle ho states . in the limit of vanishing importance threshold , it - ci(@xmath34 ) becomes equivalent to the ci method with all singly , doubly , triply , and quadruply excited determinants relative to @xmath35 [ @xmath37 . in this study , we follow the recipe described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which we perform a sequence of it - ci(@xmath34 ) calculations with decreasing thresholds and extrapolate the results to the vanishing importance threshold limit , thus obtaining a very good approximation to a complete cisdtq calculation .",
    "the it - ci approach offers two important advantages for the present study .",
    "first , it allows for a computationally inexpensive evaluation of the exact quantum - mechanical expectation values @xmath25 and @xmath29 which require much less effort than the corresponding cisdtq calculations .",
    "second , we can apply the same importance - truncation methodology to other model space truncations , such as the @xmath2 space of ncsm . in the limit of vanishing importance threshold , the resulting sequential importance - tuncation it - ncsm(seq ) scheme , which we make use of in this study as well ,",
    "reproduces the model space of the full ncsm approach @xcite .",
    "the second many - body approach we employ is the single - reference cc theory @xcite .",
    "the specific cc models considered in this study include ccsd ( cc singles and doubles ) @xcite and cr - cc(2,3 ) @xcite , both used in our recent nuclear structure work @xcite . in the ccsd approach , the cluster operator @xmath38 defining the cc ground state @xmath39 , where in the exact case @xmath40 and @xmath41 designates the @xmath42 component of @xmath38 , is truncated at the @xmath43 clusters @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath44 clusters are determined by solving the system of non - linear , energy - independent equations obtained by inserting the cc wave function , in which @xmath45 , into the schr \" odinger equation and projecting on the singly and doubly excited determinants relative to @xmath35 . the ccsd energy is calculated afterwards using the converged @xmath46 and @xmath44 clusters .",
    "since @xmath47 clusters are important to obtain a quantitative description of closed - shell systems , we correct the ccsd results for their effect through the suitably defined non - iterative corrections to ccsd energies , calculated using the ccsd values of @xmath46 and @xmath44 , defining the cr - cc(2,3 ) approach @xcite . the main advantages of cc methods , as compared to truncated ci approaches , are size extensivity and the computationally efficient description of the higher - order components of the wave function beyond a ci model space truncated at the same excitation level via products of cluster operators . for example , the basic ccsd method describes @xmath34 excitations through , e.g. , a product of two @xmath44 clusters .",
    "the details of the ccsd and cr - cc(2,3 ) methods and their comparison to it - ci can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the cc",
    "approaches the evaluation of expectation values of operators is more involved than in the ci methods . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have to rely on a response formulation or the equivalent derivatives of cc energies , since the traditional expectation value expression with the cc wave function produces a non - terminating power series in cluster amplitudes that does not lead to practical computational schemes .",
    "moreover , non - iterative cc methods , such as cr - cc(2,3 ) , rely on corrections to the energy only and do not have the corresponding wave function .",
    "thus , to determine the cc analogs of @xmath25 and @xmath29 , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we evaluate the cc energy @xmath48 for the hamiltonian @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath14 , and @xmath51 around the nominal value of @xmath14 we are interested in , where the step @xmath52 equals 0.01 .",
    "then , using a centered finite - difference form to approximate the first derivative , we compute @xmath29 as @xmath53 and from that obtain @xmath54 .",
    "we have checked the stability of the finite - difference calculations of @xmath25 and @xmath29 by including up to five @xmath55 points around @xmath14 and using a few different @xmath52 values .",
    "a cross - check of this prescription was also performed for the it - ci approach , where a comparison with the exact expectation values was possible .",
    "the experience with performing cc calculations in quantum chemistry is that the difference between the conventional quantum - mechanical expectation values and the corresponding energy derivatives , as described above , are very small , since the approximate cc methods , such as those used in this work , provide results close to full ci and full ci , being an exact diagonalization , satisfies the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "all calculations were performed with the @xmath56 interaction introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and employed in refs .",
    "@xcite . it is a pure two - body interaction derived from the argonne v18 potential @xcite via a unitary transformation to account for short - range central and tensor correlations @xcite .",
    "we consider a few representative oscillator frequencies from the range @xmath57 mev , which includes the minima of the ground - state energy of @xmath1 obtained with the many - body methods and single - particle basis sets used in this work ( see ref .",
    "as a first demonstration of the impact of the model space truncation on the coupling of intrinsic and cm motions , we analyze the it - ncsm(seq ) and it - ci(@xmath34 ) results for the ground state of @xmath1 .",
    "the it - ncsm(seq ) approach is based on the @xmath2 space of full ncsm , which allows for the exact wave function factorization given by eq . , but the importance truncation formally breaks this factorization property and so we have to check the magnitude of the resulting cm contamination . in the case of it - ci(@xmath34 ) , the underlying cisdtq model space violates translational invariance even before the importance truncation is invoked and so we expect the unphysical coupling between intrinsic and cm degrees of freedom to be more severe than in the it - ncsm(seq ) case .

    "we again resort to calculations using @xmath17 with @xmath72 . when @xmath82 mev , the typical @xmath80 values in the larger model spaces are about @xmath85 mev for it - ci(@xmath34 ) , @xmath64 mev for ccsd , and @xmath86 mev for cr - cc(2,3 ) , i.e. , all schemes suffer from a sizable cm contamination of the intrinsic energies .",
    "the energy changes @xmath80 are rather stable and do not show a clear trend for the different model spaces considered here , except for cr - cc(2,3 ) which seems to show a decrease with increasing @xmath78 .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath13 for @xmath72 and @xmath82 mev are in the @xmath87 kev range . for it - ci(@xmath34 ) and ccsd they decrease with increasing @xmath78 , whereas for cr - cc(2,3 ) they slightly increase . due to this behavior and our computational limitations we are unable to draw definite conclusions on a possible reduction of the cm contamination when going to model spaces with very large @xmath78 .",
    "note , however , that unlike in the @xmath0 case , neither it - ci(@xmath34 ) nor ccsd or cr - cc(2,3 ) recover the full many - body hilbert space for @xmath1 in the @xmath88 limit , because none of these approaches describes all of the relevant @xmath42 excitations . therefore , even when @xmath88 , the factorization of the resulting ground states is not possible .    concerning the dependence on @xmath79",
    ", we observe a systematic increase of @xmath80 and @xmath89 with increasing @xmath79 for all ci and cc methods and all model - space sizes used in this work .",
    "although @xmath30 follows this trend as well , a closer inspection of the behavior of @xmath30 in comparison to @xmath80 again reveals that the expectation value of @xmath13 at @xmath27 can not be used to quantify the degree of cm contamination .",
    "for example , in the it - ci(@xmath34 ) calculations for @xmath90 mev and @xmath83 we obtain @xmath30 of less than @xmath91 kev although @xmath80 is about @xmath92 mev .",
    "we find the virtually identical @xmath80 value in the cr - cc(2,3 ) calculations for @xmath61 mev and @xmath60 , but the corresponding @xmath30 of @xmath93 mev is larger than the aforementioned it - ci(@xmath34 ) value of @xmath30 by more than an order of magnitude .    if we compare the general picture emerging from the it - ci(@xmath34 ) , ccsd , and cr - cc(2,3 ) calculations for @xmath1 , where @xmath80 is typically in the range of @xmath94 mev , with the analogous results for @xmath0 , where @xmath80 is typically @xmath95 kev , then the popular belief that the cm contamination is suppressed as @xmath96 becomes questionable .",
    "there are other mechanisms affecting the cm contamination which counteract a simplistic @xmath96 scaling , the truncation of the many - body model space at a fixed excitation level @xmath97 and the accuracy of a given many - body method relative to full ci , which accounts for all @xmath42 excitations , being some of them .",
    "the restriction of the model space to up to @xmath34 states in it - ci(@xmath34 ) provides a far less complete approximation to the full hilbert space in the case of @xmath1 than in the @xmath0 case , where it - ci(@xmath34 ) is virtually exact .",
    "for ccsd and cr - cc(2,3 ) the situation is more complex , since the truncation of the cluster operator @xmath38 , which enters the exponential ansatz for the wave function , at @xmath44 or @xmath47 brings a variety of product excitations through the _ disconnected _ clusters , such as @xmath98 , @xmath99 , etc .",
    ", which are beyond the @xmath34 excitation level of ci , but still , ccsd and cr - cc(2,3 ) are not the exact theories , so the problem remains . for the closed - shell nuclei described by pairwise interactions , such as @xmath1 , the role of higher - order _ connected _ clusters , such as , e.g.",
    ", @xmath100 , in describing the intrinsic energy , is expected to be small @xcite , but it is not entirely clear what the significance of the higher - order cluster components of the wave function neglected in ccsd and cr - cc(2,3 ) on the cm motion and its coupling with the intrinsic state of the nucleus is .",
    "therefore , the ability of the model space used in the ci and cc calculations to represent a factorized eigenstate @xmath23 is getting progressively worse with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "we have formulated simple and rigorous criteria for diagnosing the cm contamination in many - body approaches to the nuclear structure problem .",
    "they are based on the fact that for a factorized many - body state the cm component can be manipulated , e.g. , by adding a cm contribution @xmath24 to the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath10 , without affecting the intrinsic part .",
    "the existence of an unphysical coupling between cm and intrinsic motions manifests itself in a dependence of the change of the intrinsic energy expectation value @xmath101 on @xmath14 , since @xmath28 for all @xmath14 when the nuclear state factorizes .",
    "the analysis of @xmath101 is our primary diagnostic .",
    "a secondary measure of the magnitude of the coupling between cm and intrinsic motions is the expectation value of @xmath13 at non - zero @xmath14 , which should be zero for factorizable states .",
    "in contrast to these two quantities , the expectation value @xmath29 at @xmath27 , which is sometimes used to examine the degree of cm contamination , does not provide a meaningful measure since it can have any positive value for a many - body state that factorizes .",
    "furthermore , we have shown examples where @xmath30 is on the order of a few hundred kev when @xmath80 is on the order of a few mev , indicating a sizable cm contamination .    using our diagnostics",
    "we have demonstrated that the it - ncsm approach , which is based on the @xmath2 model - space cutoff , exhibits a very good approximate factorization with @xmath101 below 150 kev for all @xmath14 in spite of the fact that the importance truncation used to select the dominant contributions to the ncsm wave function formally breaks the rigorous factorization of the @xmath2 space .",
    "switching from the @xmath102- to the @xmath78-truncation of it - ci(@xmath34 ) leads to a sizable cm contamination , with @xmath101 reaching a few mev as @xmath14 increases .",
    "similarly , the ccsd and cr - cc(2,3 ) calculations show sizable cm contaminations , with @xmath80 typically somewhat larger than in the it - ci(@xmath34 ) case . with increasing @xmath78 , the degree of cm contamination decreases for @xmath0 , but one",
    "does not observe the same clear trend for @xmath1 .",
    "this difference can be explained by the fixed maximum excitation level of the truncated ci and cc calculations used in this work .",
    "the exact solution of the schr \" odinger equation , which leads to perfect decoupling of intrinsic and cm degrees of freedom , is approached only when the ci or cc calculation allows for all possible @xmath42 excitations and when @xmath103 .",
    "the fixed excitation level @xmath97 used in the ci and cc calculations for @xmath1 prevents this .",
