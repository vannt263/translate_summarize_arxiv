    "classification of a star as a be star has long been recognised as consignment to a loosely defined phenomenological group , rather than as a definition of the evolutionary status of the star .",
    "presently the be stars may be divided into three main groups : ( i ) the classical be stars , generally thought of as the most rapidly rotating near main sequence b stars ( see e.g. slettebak , 1988 ) ; ( ii ) the herbig be stars , first identified by herbig ( 1960 ) as stars in the b spectral type range whose association with star - forming regions and emission line character might indicate that they are very young ; ( iii ) the b[e ] stars ( allen & swings , 1976 ; zickgraf et al .  1985 ) , noted for the presence of forbidden line as well as hi emission in their spectra and strong ir continuum excesses ( also seen in herbig be stars ) .",
    "while it was initially thought that b[e ] stars are preferentially supergiants , recent work ( gummersbach et al .",
    "1995 ) has demonstrated from deep lmc observations that b[e ] characteristics may also be seen at significantly lower luminosities .",
    "it is now widely accepted that classical be stars are encircled at their equators by ionized , low opening angle , almost keplerian , disks , that are optically - thick in h@xmath3 . by contrast , the circumstellar geometry of herbig be and b[e ] stars is rather more of an open question . in this work , we will open up another avenue for exploring this issue .",
    "we present medium resolution spectropolarimetry across the h@xmath3  line , a technique that , in the case of the detection of polarization changes across the line can provide an answer to the most basic question `` is the ionized material around these stars spherically symmetric or not ? '' .    by comparing h@xmath3  polarization with that of the continuum one can exploit the fact that line and continuum respectively form within a larger and smaller volume and",
    "subsequently ` see ' different scattering geometries .",
    "essentially , h@xmath3  is not significantly scattered by the ionized envelope in which it forms , whereas the continuum arising primarily from the central star embedded in the envelope undergoes electron scattering . in the case",
    "that the ionized envelope s projection on to the plane of the sky is non - circular , a net linear polarization is imprinted on the continuum light , but not on h@xmath3 producing a drop in the polarization percentage across the line ( ` line - effect ' ) .",
    "the addition of further continuum polarization by either a dusty envelope or the ism modifies this change and may even produce a net percentage rise across the line ",
    "but , significantly , it can not nullify the change .",
    "for example , schulte - ladbeck et al .  (",
    "1994 ) showed that the h@xmath3  emission line of ag car displayed enhanced polarization at one epoch while on other occasions a de - polarization across the line was observed .",
    "after the correction for isp however , h@xmath3  was de - polarized with respect to the continuum on all occasions .",
    "the advantage of spectropolarimetry over broadband polarimetry is that a result can be obtained even where it is not possible to distinguish the various contributions to the total continuum polarization .",
    "furthermore , by spectrally - resolving the h@xmath3 line profile one can hope to pick out more subtle effects arising in cases where the assumption that the h@xmath3  emission is unscattered , and hence unpolarized , breaks down .",
    "qualitatively these were demonstrated in model calculations by wood , brown & fox ( 1993 ) .",
    "when there is significant scattering of h@xmath3 the line profile in linear polarized light becomes a probe of the velocity field in the electron - scattering medium . using this tool we have already shown in the case of the b[e ] star , hd 87643 , that there is direct evidence of a rotating and expanding outflow ( oudmaijer et al 1998 ) .",
    "the pioneering work in this area was made in the seventies , when clarke & mclean ( 1974 ) , poeckert ( 1975 ) and poeckert & marlborough ( 1976 , hereafter pm ) conducted narrow - band polarimetric studies of be stars that compared the linear polarization on and off h@xmath3 .",
    "many instances of line de - polarization were found , showing that the envelopes of be stars do not project as circles onto the sky . after this time",
    ", polarimetric studies were made of several classes of object , but due to observational difficulties it remained a specialist activity .",
    "however in the past few years there has been rising interest in the technique .",
    "spectropolarimetry has been performed on several strong h@xmath3  emitting evolved stars , such as ag car and hr car ( schulte - ladbeck et al .",
    "1994 , clampin et al .",
    "1995 ) , where the position angle of the spatially - unresolved flattened electron scattering region has been shown to agree with the observed extension of the optically visible nebulae surrounding these objects .",
    "both the b[e ] and herbig be stars are ideal objects to subject to this style of observation , since they are strong h@xmath3  emitters and often optically bright enough to render studies at medium resolution with high photon counts feasible with 4-meter class telescopes .",
    "furthermore there is a clear need for this type of observation since a change in the linear polarization across h@xmath3  can be the only direct evidence of electron scattering operating on the scale of a few stellar radii as opposed to polarization by a dusty envelope .    in the first instance , the observations presented here were motivated by the aim of examining herbig be stars for the presence of ionized circumstellar disks .",
    "these reputedly intermediate mass objects present a phenomenology that suggests they are approaching or have recently achieved a main sequence location on the hr diagram ",
    "they are the higher mass counterparts of the t tauri stars .",
    "the paradigm for star formation invokes a collapsing cloud and conservation of angular momentum that results in the formation of a flattened circumstellar ( accretion ) disk , that eventually accretes or is blown away by an outflow .",
    "however there is not yet a consensus that accretion disks are commonly associated with the known herbig be ( and ae ) stars .",
    "there is a certain irony that t tauri stars , their lower mass counterparts , are generally accepted to have disk - like envelopes ( e.g. hh30 in burrows et al .",
    "1996 ) , while evidence is accumulating that their higher mass counterparts , the optically obscured massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) are also surrounded by disk - like structures ( e.g. hoare & garrington 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "merlin radio data on mwc 297 , a nearby radio - bright early herbig be star , also reveals an elongated ( but ionized ) structure on a spatial scale of @xmath6100  au ( drew et al .",
    "more direct high resolution imaging is clearly worthwhile and of course spectropolarimetry can help identify interesting targets .",
    "nevertheless , at the present , there persists a debate that the observed spectral energy distributions require , on the one hand , dusty disks ( e.g. malfait , bogaert & waelkens , 1998 ) or , on the other , that they can be fit satisfactorily by spherically symmetric dusty envelopes ( miroshnichenko , ivezi & elitzur , 1997 ; see also the overview of this issue in pezzuto , strafella & lorenzetti 1997 ) . the recent direct detection of a rotating disk around a herbig ae star by mannings , koerner & sargent ( 1997 ) indicates that at least some of these objects have disk - like geometries .",
    "broad - band polarimetry of a number of herbig stars has revealed variability of the polarization of the objects which could imply deviations from spherical symmetry of the dusty envelopes ( e.g. grinin et al .",
    "1994 , who studied ux ori ; jain & bhatt , 1995 ) .",
    "by contrast , the h@xmath3spectropolarimetry traces scales even closer to the star , the ionized material .    with regard to the b[e ] stars , first picked out by allen & swings ( 1976 ) , the argument for embedding them in disk - like equatorial structures has largely been won in that there is widespread acceptance of zickgraf s phenomenological model ( zickgraf et al 1985 , 1986 ) .",
    "this is because there is compelling spectral evidence of a fast , presumably polar , wind at uv wavelengths , that combines with a high emission measure , much more slowly expanding , presumably equatorial , flow traced by strong optical emission lines .",
    "broad - band polarimetry by zickgraf & schulte - ladbeck ( 1989 ) and magalh@xmath7es ( 1992 ) indicate that for a sub - sample of b[e ] objects , the circumstellar dust , located at larger distances from the star , is distributed in a geometry deviating from spherically symmetric .",
    "the unresolved issue is how these axially - symmetric structures arise and indeed what the stellar evolutionary status of this object class really is .",
    "the fact that b[e ] stars are far from being exclusively supergiants deepens the mystery . in this context , herbig s ( 1994 )",
    "concern about the difficulty of distinguishing herbig be from b[e ] stars becomes all the more intriguing .",
    "to progress in understanding how b[e ] disks arise , a more complete description of the disk density and velocity field is highly desirable .",
    "it is in this respect that h@xmath3  spectropolarimetry has the potential to provide unique insights .    because of the problems of distinguishing between the b[e ] and herbig be categories",
    ", there is always a significant probability that a herbig be sample contains some b[e ] stars .",
    "indeed , for galactic b[e ] stars it is often difficult to determine whether an object is a luminous evolved object or a less luminous pre - main sequence object ( see e.g. the discussions on hd 87643 ; oudmaijer et al.1998 , mwc 137 ; esteban & fernndez 1998 , and hd 45677 ; de winter & van den ancker 1997 ) .",
    "here we exploit this in that our programme of h@xmath3spectropolarimetry programme includes as targets relatively clear - cut examples of post main sequence b[e ] stars alongside undisputed herbig be stars and objects that might be either . in this paper",
    "we give an overview of our observing campaign to date . in section  2 , the way in which targets were selected and the observations are discussed .",
    "the results and their interpretation are presented on a case - by - case basis in sec .",
    "sec .  4 contains a discussion on the power of spectropolarimetry and what we have learned from this program .",

    "the errors on the equivalent widths of the h@xmath3  lines are expected to be of order 5% , the errors cited for the polarization data are based on photon - statistics only , and rounded upwards .",
    "systematic ( i.e. external ) errors in the polarization are estimated to be of order 0.05%  0.1% .",
    "the optical linear spectropolarimetric data were obtained using the rgo spectrograph with the 25 cm camera on the 3.9-metre anglo - australian telescope during three observing runs in january 1995 , december 1995 and december 1996 respectively . during the first two runs ,",
    "the weather provided some spectacular views of lightning from the telescope , but only limited data . during clear time",
    ", we aimed at observing the brightest objects in order to make the best of lower - than - desired count rates .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting polarization measurements proved to be very stable .",
    "the last run was mostly clear , opening the way for time to be spent on some of our fainter targets .",
    "the instrumental set - up was similar during all observing runs and consisted of a rotating half - wave plate and a calcite block to separate the light into perpendicularly polarized light waves .",
    "two holes of size 2.7 arcsec and separated by 22.8 arcsec in the dekker allow simultaneous observations of the object and the sky .",
    "four spectra are recorded , the o and e rays of the target object and the sky respectively .",
    "one complete polarization observation consists of a series of consecutive exposures at four rotator positions . per object ,",
    "several cycles of observation at the four rotator positions were obtained in order to check on the repeatability of the results .",
    "indeed , we find that multiple observations of the same star result in essentially the same polarization spectrum .",
    "to prevent the ccd from saturating on the peak of h@xmath3 , shorter integration times were adopted for those objects with particularly strong h@xmath3emission .",
    "spectropolarimetric and zero - polarization standards were observed every night .",
    "a 1024 @xmath9 1024 pixel tek - ccd detector was used which , combined with the 1200v grating , yielded a spectral range of 400 @xmath8 , centered on h@xmath3 .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed by observing a copper - argon lamp before or after each object was observed . in all observations reported here a slit width of 1.5@xmath10",
    "a log of the observations is provided in table 1 .",
    "bias - subtraction , flatfielding , extraction of the spectra and wavelength calibration was performed in iraf ( tody 1993 ) . the resulting spectral resolution as measured from arc lines",
    "is 60 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the e and o ray data were then extracted and imported into the time series / polarimetry package ( tsp ) incorporated in the figaro software package maintained by starlink .",
    "the stokes parameters were determined and subsequently extracted .    a slight drift of a few degrees in position angle ( pa )",
    "was calibrated by fitting its wavelength dependence in nightly 100% polarized observations of bright unpolarized stars ( obtained by inserting an hn-22 filter in the light - path ) and removed from the polarization spectra .",
    "the instrumental polarization deduced from observations of unpolarized standards proved to be smaller than 0.1% in all cases .    in july 1998 , mwc 297 was observed in service time with the isis spectrograph and polarimetric optics on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope , la palma .",
    "the instrumental set - up included the 1200r grating and a 1124@xmath91124 tek2 detector , providing a wavelength coverage of 400 @xmath8  around h@xmath3  and a spectral resolution of 40 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the data reduction was the same as for the aat data .",
    "polarization accuracy is in principle only limited by photon - statistics .",
    "one roughly needs to detect 1 million photons per resolution element to achieve an accuracy of 0.1% in polarization ( the fractional error goes at @xmath6 1/@xmath11 ) .",
    "however , although it is probably fair to say that the internal consistency of a polarization spectrum follows photon - statistics , the external consistency ( i.e. the absolute value for the polarization , checking for variability ) is limited due to systematic errors . for example , when calculating the polarization of a given spectral interval one can reach polarization percentages with a statistical error of several thousandth of a percent .",
    "however , instrumental polarization ( less than 0.1% ) , scattered light and low - level intrinsic variability of the polarization standards may influence the zero - points .",
    "the quality and amount of data taken of spectropolarimetric standard stars is at present not yet sufficient to reach absolute accuracies below the 0.1% mark ( see manual by tinbergen & rutten , 1997 ) .",
    "a feeling for the possible accuracies in our data can be obtained by studying some of the objects that have been observed on different occasions .",
    "seven , respectively 6 independent observations of the be star hd 76534 and the polarization standard hd  80558 yield a mean polarization and rotation of ( 0.49 % with an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.03 % , 124@xmath12with a scatter of 3@xmath12 ) and ( 3.19 @xmath13 0.11% , 162 @xmath13 1.6@xmath12 ) respectively .",
    "it is encouraging to note that our independent continuum measurements stretching over more than a year are mostly within 0.1% , and often within 0.05% , in polarization .",
    "some h@xmath3  parameters and continuum polarizations are presented in table  2 . in the following ,",
    "the results across the full range of targets observed are summarized .",
    "these are grouped such that we begin with those objects showing no discernable polarization changes across h@xmath3  (  3.1 ) , and then move on to objects which do show percentage changes and/or rotations (  3.2 ) .",
    "unless specifically stated , we have made no attempt below to correct for the interstellar polarization ( isp ) .",
    "this decision is based on the following : the main goal of this study is the detection of polarimetric changes across the h@xmath3  line . since the wavelength dependence of the interstellar polarization only becomes apparent on wavelength ranges larger than our spectra provide , the isp will only contribute a constant polarization vector in ( q , u ) space to the observed spectra .",
    "a further reason to refrain from isp corrections here , is that the methods commonly used for this ( field - star method and continuum variability , see e.g. mclean & clarke 1979 ) do not always return unambiguous values .",
    "however , in the absence of isp correction , it is useful to remember the point raised in the introduction that the isp can change what might otherwise be a reduction of the linear polarization percentage across the h@xmath3  line into an increase in polarization , or an apparently constant polarization , but accompanied by a significant rotation in the position angle .",
    "the same effect can occur in the event of additional polarization due to circumstellar dust .    nevertheless , regardless of the influence of the isp and polarization due to circumstellar dust , it is possible to derive the _",
    "intrinsic _ angle of the electron - scattering material ( e.g. schulte - ladbeck et al.1994 ) . assuming the line is depolarized , the vector connecting the line- and continuum polarization in the qu plane will have a slope that is equivalent to the intrinsic angle of the scattering material responsible for the continuum polarization .",
    "since the wavelength dependence of both circumstellar dust polarization and isp is small , they add only a constant qu vector to all points in both line and continuum , and thus will not affect the difference in line - to - continuum polarization .",
    "this slope is measured as @xmath14 = 0.5@xmath9atan(@xmath15u/@xmath15q ) .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the objects that do not show a line - effect . in principle",
    "such an observation implies that the projection of the ionized region on the plane of the sky is ( mostly ) circular .",
    "we will find that this does not necessarily have to be the case .",
    "the objects falling into this group are lk  h@xmath3  218 , hen  3 - 230 , as  116 , hd  52721 , v380  ori , hd  76534 , @xmath4  ori and mwc  297 .",

    "for example in the case of lk  h@xmath3  218 , there seems enhanced polarization at the position of the stronger redshifted emission component in the line .",
    "however this is not strictly even a 2@xmath16 detection .",
    "coarser binning can yield a 3@xmath16 enhanced polarization in the line ( at smaller resolution this is only present in one pixel however ) but in truth it would appear that 100 minutes exposure is not enough for this object .",
    "the null results for hen  3 - 230 and as  116 are more sure .",
    "both targets have extremely bright line emission . as previous observations of them",
    "are extremely sparse , their evolutionary status remains undetermined .",
    "based on its low excitation spectrum stenholm & acker ( 1987 ) argue that hen 3 - 230 is not a planetary nebula , despite having figured in many previous papers to be one . as 116",
    "was appeared in a catalogue of emission line stars of miller & merrill ( 1951 ) , since then not much work has been published .",

    "both , nevertheless , present significant continuum polarizations . since hd  52721 presents little of an infared continuum excess ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "1992 ) , it might seem plausible that this star is a low - inclination classical be star behind a significant interstellar column . indeed the single - peaked h@xmath3 emission is consistent with this , but in contrast to the @xmath18 measurement of 400@xmath1340 km s@xmath2 reported by finkenzeller ( 1985 ) suggesting high inclination .",
    "v380  ori exhibiting a strong infrared continuum excess , would appear to be optically - veiled and hence sits more convincingly in the haebe object class .",
    "the absence of a line - effect in v380  ori may simply imply lower inclination to the line of sight .",
    "[ [ hd-76534 ] ] hd 76534 + + + + + + + +    the initial 1995 data on this source have already been presented by oudmaijer & drew ( 1997 ) .",
    "there it was shown that these data did not indicate any changes across h@xmath3 .",
    "our new data confirm this and show no hints of pronounced polarization variability in its modest @xmath60.5% level .",
    "this is despite the source s propensity for spectral variability clearly illustrated by the 11 january 1995 transformation of h@xmath3  absorption into well - developed double - peaked emission within hours ( oudmaijer & drew 1997 ) .",
    "table  2 lists the h@xmath3  equivalent widths at the various occasions that the object was observed .",

    "pm find that h@xmath3  shows a polarization dip while clarke & brooks ( 1984 ) find the same in h@xmath19 .",
    "this difference is presumably connected with the stronger h@xmath3  emission reported by pm ( line to continuum ratio of 1.8 versus our figure of 1.4 - which was not binned to the same narrow band , and is thus a strong upper limit ) , and higher linear polarization ( 0.38% versus our 0.30% ) . since classical",
    "be stars and , indeed , herbig be stars are known to be emission line variables , this change is probably due to a lowering of the ionized emission measure of the equatorial disk around this star . given the great disparity between the thomson scattering and h@xmath3 absorption cross - sections , a relatively modest drop in the h@xmath3 equivalent width could well be accompanied by a collapse in the percentage of linearly - polarized scattered starlight .",

    "furthermore , the 5 ghz radio image ( see drew et al .",
    "1997 ) , which provides an extinction - free view of the ionized circumstellar medium around mwc  297 , indicates an elongated geometry that would suggest a line effect ought to be apparent in such a bright emission line source .",
    "although at first sight very surprising , we consider two different hypotheses that may explain this apparent paradox .",
    "firstly , we can conclude we are seeing the h@xmath3  line directly , and that the line - forming region is indeed round .",
    "since the h@xmath3  line is formed in a potentially much smaller volume than the continuum 5 ghz radiation , the rounder appearance of the h@xmath3  line - forming region indicates that the geometry changes between the near - stellar scale and the larger scale sampled at radio wavelengths .",
    "spatial evolution of this type has been predicted for lower mass stars ( see frank & mellema 1996 ) .",
    "secondly , it may be that h@xmath3  is formed in an edge - on disk like structure , but that the optical light does not reach us directly , and is completely obscured in the line - of - sight .",
    "the light that we see could then be ` mirrored ' by scattering dust clouds located above and/or beneath the obscuring material .",
    "if the scattering dust - clouds ` see ' a nearly circularly symmetric h@xmath3  emitting region , it will not see any de - polarization across the line either .",
    "consequently , the light reaching us will not show any polarization changes across h@xmath3 .",
    "that dust - scattering plays a role in this object is already suggested by the spectral energy distribution , which shows a notable excess in the @xmath20-band ( bergner et al .  1988 ; hillenbrand et al 1992 ) , possibly due to the ` blueing ' effect .",
    "we may therefore have a similar situation to that in the red rectangle ( see e.g. osterbart , langer & weigelt 1997 , waelkens et al 1996 ) , where it was only recently realized that the central star is actually not the star itself , but its reflection against dusty knots located above and below a very optically thick dust lane .",
    "this finding explained the long - standing problem of the energy balance ; the apparently absorbed light from a star with such a modest reddening ( @xmath21 of order 1 ) is orders of magnitude less than that being re - radiated in the infrared .",

    "this would not be completely unexpected , as mwc 297 is in certain respects an intermediate object between the optically visible herbig be stars , and their more massive counterparts , the becklin - neugebauer ( bn ) type objects , which suffer from large optical extinctions ( @xmath22  often in excess of 20 ) .",

    "how does this relate to the view taken by schulte - ladbeck et al .",
    "( 1992 ) of their similar detection of enhanced h@xmath3  linear polarization ? in their isp - corrected spectrum , h@xmath3  is still enhanced with respect to its adjacent continuum .",
    "they explained this in terms of an ionized region much closer to the circumstellar dust than the stellar point source : the h@xmath3  line then sees a larger solid angle of scattering material and is thus more polarized than the continuum .",
    "this seems to us an unlikely alternative to the conventional view that the ionized region , with a temperature of @xmath610000  k , is located within a very much smaller volume around the star than the dust , which should have an equilibrium temperature below @xmath61500  k , the dust condensation temperature ( see e.g. the spectral energy distribution modelling of hd  45677 by sorrell 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore , the isp correction adopted by schulte - ladbeck et al.(1992 ) was the _ ad hoc _ value proposed by coyne & vrba ( 1976 ) on the basis that it should be comparable with the relatively steady observed polarization in the blue ( the red is much more variable ) .",
    "whatever this correction actually does correspond to , there is no reason to suppose that it accounts for both the isp and circumstellar dust polarization .",
    "if both sources of foreground polarization can be removed with confidence , only then can it be discerned whether there is an intrinsic linear polarization enhancement across h@xmath3 .",
    "hence , for the timebeing , we retain the more conventional view that the observed polarization change across h@xmath3  is due to electron scattering in the ionized region , which may project as an oblate ` disk ' or as a prolate ` bipolar flow ' .",
    "now we turn to consider the change in polarization of the continuum points .",
    "as it is likely that the isp is constant in time , the additional , potentially variable , mechanisms involved are electron - scattering and circumstellar dust scattering . in the same manner as the polarization changes across",
    "h@xmath3  move along a constant angle , temporal changes , due to a polarization mechanism that becomes stronger or weaker , may only affect the magnitude of polarization and not the pa .",
    "if we adopt this principle here , the intrinsic pa of the polarizing material responsible for the change in continuum polarization is then @xmath6 20@xmath12 .",
    "since the intrinsic pa of the electron scattering region is @xmath6 75@xmath12 , and its effect on the h@xmath3  line appears not to have changed significantly , the variable component does not seem to be electron scattering .",
    "this leaves circumstellar dust scattering as the likely variable .",
    "although the polarization variability of hd 45677 is well known , dating back to the paper in 1976 by coyne & vrba , it is only the high spectral resolution of the current data that allows us to discriminate between electron and dust scattering .",
    "the major question remaining is why the apparent rotation of about 55@xmath12  between the major axis of the ( variable ) dust polarization and the h@xmath3  line forming region exists . in principle , this would suggest that multiple geometries , such as a combination of an equatorial disk and a bipolar flow , would show a rotation of 90@xmath12 , regardless of the respective opening angles .",
    "the cancellation of perpendicularly - oriented polarization vectors tends to increase for larger opening angles , decreasing the observed polarization percentage , but the 90@xmath12  rotation will remain intact . an answer may lie in the clumpiness of the dusty material around the object .",
    "hd 45677 is photometrically variable , a property attributed to the presence of various dust - clouds surrounding and even orbiting the object ( de winter & van den ancker 1997 ) .",
    "clumpy material is also revealed by the spectroscopic variability .",
    "grady et al .  ( 1993 ) show the presence of variable redshifted absorption lines which are attributed to infalling and evaporating cometary bodies .",
    "these indicate patchiness of the circumstellar material as well .",
    "the result of such clumpy material on the polarization angle is relatively easy to understand .",
    "if ( one of ) the scattering regions is clumpy , a rotation of 90@xmath12  is only retrieved if the clumps are symmetrically distributed around the central star .",
    "if not , not all perpendicularly oriented polarization vectors will cancel out , and the net effect is that the observed position angle does not represent the time - averaged mean orientation of the scattering material . a similar argument has been brought forward by trammell et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to explain the rotation of 70@xmath12  ( instead of 90@xmath12 ) in the spectrum of iras 08005 - 2356 .",
    "it seems thus that the rotation between the dust ring and the h@xmath3  line forming region , which is less than 90@xmath12 , could be the result of scattering with incomplete cancellation in an inhomogeneous region .",
    "a word of caution should be given here with regard to the ` true ' orientation of the dusty material .",
    "the 20@xmath12  that was measured between the continuum points in fig .",
    "[ qu ] , and its comparison with the intrinsic angle of the electron scattering region points to the clumpiness .",
    "however , this direction along which the variation occurred should not now be associated with the orientation of the scattering region , since we only measure incomplete cancellation of dust clumps at changing positions",
    ". only sequences of observations of this type may give a clue as to whether the variable dust component arises from a region perpendicular to or colinear with the electron scattering region .",
    "the main result of the new observations of hd 45677 is that it is possible to discriminate between the _ electron _ scattering and the _ dust _ scattering regions .",
    "the former can be probed by the change across h@xmath3  while the latter is probed by the variability of the polarization of the continuum .",
    "this paper concerned medium resolution spectropolarimetry of a relatively large sample of b[e ] and herbig be stars , objects which so far have never been observed in this way .",
    "we have described the results of these exploratory observations in a qualitative way and we summarize the highlights of both non - detections and detections below , and then briefly discuss the implications of the results .",
    "the main goal of the observations was to answer the basic question `` does the ionized material around these stars project to circular symmetry on the sky , or not ? '' by investigating whether or not a ` line - effect ' is seen across h@xmath3 . in principle , a non - detection should imply a circular projection .",
    "this encompasses three - dimensional geometries that are spherically - symmetric , or disk - like seen close to face - on .",
    "two of the non - detections failed in quite different ways to fit into this simple picture :    first , in the case of mwc  297  a young b1.5 star in the aquila rift ( drew et al .",
    "1997 )  observation over two hours or so produced evidence of , at most , a subtle line effect .",
    "this was despite the fact that the radio image of this object shows a clearly elongated ionized gas distribution .",
    "an intriguing interpretation , testable by high resolution imaging , is that we view mwc  297 only indirectly at optical wavelengths .",
    "if the direct sightline to the disk should reveal an edge - on structure , but if the disk is obscured from view due to the large extinction , scattering dust clouds may see a more circularly symmetric structure , such as a face - on disk , and reflect a polarization spectrum without a line effect to the observer .",
    "second , we have presented data on @xmath4  ori , a star that has been reported twice before in the literature as showing an h@xmath3  line effect ( in both instances the observations were narrow - band rather than spectropolarimetric ) .",
    "the absence of any such effect in our data suggests that the ionized envelope is smaller than at previous occasions because the , optically thin , electron - scattering is more sensitive to changes in ionization than the optically thick h@xmath3  emission .",
    "the non - detection in @xmath4 ori implies that single epoch measurements are not always sufficient to provide a definitive answer on the circumstellar geometry of these objects .    in both cases ,",
    "it is clear that h@xmath3  spectropolarimetry is best judged in the context of other observational constraints on the target .",
    "indeed they warn not to assume _ too _ quickly that the ionized regions in stars without a line effect are face - on disks or spherically - symmetric .",
    "in contrast , the detection of a line - effect immediately tells us that the scattering region does not project to circular symmetry on the sky .",
    "the data presented in this paper provide a new , richer variety of line effects than has hitherto been seen in the literature .",
    "this is in part due to their relatively high spectral resolution .",
    "the curious cases of the somewhat similar situations of hd 37806 and hd 50138 offer great opportunities to understand the conditions close to the star .",

    "both stars also exhibit a superposed single component of h@xmath3  emission that is also picked out by a change in linear polarization at much the same wavelength .",
    "this suggests that the line profile as a whole may be the result of two kinematically - distinct phenomena .",

    "this of course means that almost half have ( namely hd  259431 , hd  37806 and hd  53367 ) and should encourage further campaigns of this nature . using narrow bands , poeckert & marlborough ( 1976 ) surveyed 48",
    "be stars and found that 21 showed the line effect at a 3@xmath16 level , while a further 8 show the line effect at a 2 - 3@xmath16 level .",
    "they investigated the relation between the intrinsic polarization of these be stars ( measured from the h@xmath3polarization change ) with @xmath38 ( as measure of inclination ) and found that their observations could well be explained by inclination effects .",
    "although based on very small number statistics , the comparable incidence of line effects in the herbig be stars observed does hint that flattened ionized circumstellar structures are quite common for this object class as well , and that the non - detections in our sample could be due to random sampling of the full range of inclinations .",
    "one of our non - detections is of course mwc  297 , an object revealed by radio imaging to be non - circular ( albeit on a scale of tens of au ) .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the h@xmath3  polarization effect is sensitive to much smaller structures than are presently probed directly by imaging .",
    "analytical calculations such as those by by cassinelli , nordsieck & murison ( 1987 , their fig .",
    "7 ) demonstrate that the bulk of electron scattering occurs on scales as small as two to three stellar radii .",
    "if the herbig be stars we have observed are indeed young or even pre - main sequence objects , then the deviation from spherical symmetry of the ionized region is presumably a consequence of the way in which they have formed . viewed in these terms , the structures that we detect now via these polarization measurements could well be accretion disks that reach to within a stellar radius or so of the stellar surface .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with the magnetospheric accretion model widely regarded as applicable to t  tau stars , wherein magnetic channeling inhibits the formation of the inner disk ( see shu et al .",
    "1994 ) . for herbig",
    "be stars it remains a more open question as to how far magnetic fields determine the accretion geometry .",
    "since the main sequence destiny of these more massive stars is to possess radiative envelopes , it leaves more room to doubt that magnetic fields must play a big role at the stage in which we are able to observe them",
    ". it will be interesting to see if further h@xmath3  spectropolarimetry continues to uncover plausible disk accretors .",
    "a conceptual model of how these objects may look , still embedded in accretion disks reaching into the stellar surface , has recently been devised by drew , proga & stone ( 1998 , building on the work of proga , stone & drew 1998 ) .",
    "this work shows how observationally - significant disk winds , driven by radiation pressure , would be created .",
    "a further piece in the puzzle of herbig be and bn objects that these predicted flows can help explain is the high contrast , quite narrow hi line emission often observed at earlier b spectral types ( drew , 1998 ) .",
    "a further very strong outcome of this study is that all objects that can be classified as ( evolved ) b[e ] stars , presented significant polarization changes across h@xmath3 .",
    "a factor that clearly helps increase the likelihood of detecting a spectropolarimetric line effect in b[e ] stars is that their h@xmath3  profiles are typically extremely high contrast and often somewhat broader than in herbig  be stars .",
    "pre - eminent among our b[e ] group is hd  87643 which has already been discussed in a separate paper ( oudmaijer et al .",
    "1998 ) . here",
    "we have presented mwc  137 ( probably an evolved b[e ] star ) , hd  45677 and hd  50138 .",
    "the fact that _ all _ observed galactic b[e ] stars in our sample show the line - effect in one incarnation or another lends strong support to the zickgraf et al .",
    "( 1985 , 1986 ) model .",
    "the variety of line - effects observed in our data illustrate that the structures around these stars have their deviation from spherical symmetry in common , but that the details in each case are different .",
    "so far , the discussion of these data has been largely qualitative . as models simulating",
    "these phenomena begin to be calculated there will no doubt be a considerable sharpening of insight .",
    "apart from providing some striking insights into a number of the targets observed , the programme of observations we have described here has offered some lessons in how best to obtain single - line spectropolarimetric data .",
    "it is clear that the spectral resolution available to us ( @xmath39 ) has in most instances been just enough . as",
    "numerical modelling becomes more commonplace , the case for increased spectral resolution will become stronger .",
    "the main issue , nevertheless , is the achievement of high enough data quality .",
    "our 8@xmath40 magnitude and brighter objects have come out well in under an hour s telescope time , while 10@xmath40 to 12@xmath40 magnitude objects require several hours observation with a 4-metre class telescope in at least middling weather conditions .",
    "ultimately , these fainter sources will be best served by 8-metre class facilities where the shorter total integration times will be less subject to weather influence ",
    "presently they can be an uncertain struggle .",
    "the overall conclusion of this study is that this relatively unexplored mode of observing does yield valuable new insights . in some instances",
    "we have encountered deepening mysteries that suggest conclusions drawn from other data have missed something .",
    "mwc  297 and hd  45677 are both good examples of this . at the same time",
    ", h@xmath3spectropolarimetry readily throws up examples that demand sophisticated numerical modelling of a type that is just beginning to become available ( hillier , 1996 ; harries , 1996 ) .",
    "we thank the staff at the anglo - australian telescope for their expert advice and support .",
    "conor nixon and graeme busfield are thanked for their help during some of the observing runs .",
    "the allocation of time on the anglo - australian telescope was awarded by patt , the united kingdom allocation panel .",
    "rdo is funded by the particle physics and astronomy research council of the united kingdom .",
    "the data analysis facilities are provided by the starlink project , which is run by cclrc on behalf of pparc .",
    "part of the observations are based on data obtained from the william herschel telescope , tenerife , spain , in the isaac newton group service scheme .",
