    "the soft - hadronic observables measured in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic ( transverse - momentum spectra , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath0 , and the hbt radii ) are described very well by the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics or by viscous hydrodynamics with a small viscosity to entropy ratio ( for recent reviews see , for example , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the implicit in this success is the use of a rather early thermalization time that is quite often well below 1 fm  . ]",
    "the early starting time of hydrodynamics , that is identified with the thermalization time , is justified in a natural way if the quark - gluon plasma is a strongly interacting system @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are attempts to describe the rhic data with the help of models which do not assume very fast thermalization .",
    "the success of such models in reproducing the data may indicate that the quark - gluon plasma is not necessarily a strongly interacting system .",
    "an example of such a model has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors assume that the perfect - fluid stage is preceded by free streaming of partons , see also @xcite .",
    "another example is a model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the initial stage consists of partons with thermalized transverse degrees of freedom only @xcite .",
    "recently , we have formulated a framework of highly - anisotropic and strongly - dissipative hydrodynamics ( adhydro ) @xcite .",
    "this model interpolates between a highly - anisotropic initial state ( where the longitudinal and transverse pressures may be substantially different from each other ) and the regime described by the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "it may be used to analyze the effects of early anisotropic pressure on the subsequent evolution of matter .",
    "adhydro may be treated as an important generalization of the models introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite because the change from the early highly - anisotropic system to the subsequent locally isotropic stage is described as a continuous process .",
    "we note that in @xcite a similar change was described with the help of the landau matching conditions which demand that the energy flux in the transition is conserved but do not demand the continuity of all components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "our formulation of the model in @xcite has been followed by the papers by martinez and strickland @xcite , where a similar approach has been derived from the kinetic theory with the collision term treated in the relaxation time approximation . in the case of purely longitudinal expansion",
    "one may show that the approaches introduced in @xcite and @xcite lead to the same structure of equations that determine the evolution of pressure asymmetry and entropy density .",
    "the only difference may be found in the form of the entropy source .",
    "interestingly , if the pressure asymmetry is small , both approaches are strictly equivalent and they agree with the second - order israel - stewart theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown additionally , that the entropy source terms used in @xcite and @xcite lead to practically the same results even if the initial pressure asymmetry is very large .    in this paper , besides the boost - invariant longitudinal motion , the transverse expansion is also taken into account .",
    "in such a general case , the explicit connections between adhydro , the underlying kinetic theory , and the israel - stewart theory have not been established yet .",
    "however , in the initial stage where the effects of pressure asymmetry are most significant , the longitudinal motion dominates the dynamics of the system , and we deal with a situation that is quite similar to that described in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , at the stage where the transverse flow becomes substantial , the pressure asymmetries are eliminated and the system s expansion is well described by the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "therefore , we consider adhydro as a good candidate for the model which extrapolates well between an initial highly - anisotropic state and a later perfect - fluid phase  .",
    "in this paper we use adhydro and show that as long as the initial energy density profile is unchanged the calculated observables remain practically the same .",
    "this result indicates the insensitivity of the analyzed observables to the initial anisotropy and suggests that the complete thermalization of the system may be delayed to easily acceptable times of about 1 fm . in this way we find further support to ideas presented in @xcite .",
    "the fact that different initial pictures lead to the same results for hadronic observables means that the freeze - out conditions for different physical scenarios are similar .",
    "this suggests the formation of universal flow in heavy - ion collisions , as pointed out first in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", different initial conditions may affect other observables , that have not been studied here .",
    "in particular , the early pressure anisotropy may have an important impact on the directed flow , as shown recently in @xcite .",
    "the study of this problem requires , however , a generalization of the adhydro code to 3 + 1 dimensions , which is a work in progress .",
    "the adhydro model is based on the following form of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite , @xmath1 here @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the energy density , transverse pressure , and longitudinal pressure , respectively . in the case where the two pressures are equal , , we recover the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid .",
    "the four - vector @xmath5 in ( [ tmunudec ] ) is the hydrodynamic flow , @xmath6 and @xmath7 defines the longitudinal ( beam ) direction , @xmath8 the four - vectors @xmath5 and @xmath7 satisfy the following normalization conditions : @xmath9 in the local - rest - frame ( lrf ) of the fluid element we have @xmath10 and , and the energy - momentum tensor is reduced to a simple form ,    @xmath11    thus , the formula ( [ tmunudec ] ) allows for different pressures in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",

    "for the model results agree with the data . for larger values of transverse - momentum , the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics overshoots the experimental data , which is a known effect .",
    "in this paper , a recently formulated model of highly - anisotropic and strongly - dissipative hydrodynamics ( adhydro ) has been used to study the effects of strong initial anisotropy of pressure on soft hadronic observables studied at rhic ( transverse - momentum spectra , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath0 , and the hbt radii ) .",
    "we have found that the initial conditions with different anisotropies lead to similar results , provided the initial energy density profile in the transverse plane is the same .",
    "this result agrees well with earlier findings where the perfect - fluid stage starting at about 1 fm was preceded by free streaming of partons or by expansion of matter thermalized only in the transverse direction .",
    "the main conclusion from those studies is that the complete thermalization of matter may take part at the times of about 1 fm . in order to reproduce the elliptic flow of pions ,",
    "it is not necessary to assume that matter thermalizes within a fraction of one fermi , as the decrease of spatial eccentricity of the reaction zone is compensated by the building of the transverse flow in an early non - equilibrium stage ( described as free streaming , transverse hydrodynamics , or highly - anisotropic and strongly - dissipative hydrodynamics used in this paper ) .",
    "the conservation laws ( [ enmomcon ] ) and ( [ engrow ] ) can be integrated over the spatial transverse coordinates .",
    "this leads to the global conservation laws . in the case of eq .",
    "( [ engrow ] ) we obtain @xmath139 = \\tau \\int d^2 x_\\perp \\sigma ( \\tau,{\\bf x}_\\perp ) .",
    "\\label{g1}\\ ] ] if the entropy source term @xmath140 vanishes , the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) is zero .",
    "this implies that the entropy per unit rapidity is conserved . in the case of eq .",
    "( [ engrow ] ) we define the quantity @xmath141 , @xmath142 the integration of ( [ enmomcon ] ) yields @xmath143 = -   \\int d^2 x_\\perp   p_\\parallel ( \\tau,{\\bf x}_\\perp ) .",
    "\\label{g2}\\ ] ] if the longitudinal pressure @xmath144 vanishes , no work is done in the longitudinal direction , and eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) leads to the conservation of the energy per unit rapidity .",
    "equations ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) are useful for checking the numerical code .",
    "we have found that in our calculations they are satisfied with the accuracy of about 0.001% .",
