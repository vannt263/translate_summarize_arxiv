    "the icosahedral ( i- ) alpdre alloy has unique electronic properties compared to all the other quasicrystalline alloys discovered so far . specifically , some of the more resistive i - alpdre polycrystalline samples lie on the insulating side of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , with conductivity at 4k as low as @xmath3 and resistance ratios between 4k and 300k ( @xmath4 ) larger than 200 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "this alloy of metals becomes an insulator , the origin for this remarkable result being attributed to the specificity of the i - alpdre phase .",
    "however , in the early 2000 s , electrical measurements performed on i - alpdre single - grains @xcite showed significantly higher conductivity @xmath5 and lower @xmath6 , thereby placing i - alpdre single grains on the metallic side of the mit .",
    "these values are similar to those observed in the i - alcufe and i - alpdmn phases .",
    "a controversy followed as to wether the high electrical resistivities observed in some i - alpdre polycrystalline samples are intrinsic to the i - phase or due to extrinsic effects , such as impurities , secondary phases or grain boundaries .",
    "extrinsic origin proponents argued @xcite that the high resistivities of polycrystalline i - alpdre ingots result from a combination of a high porosity and the existence of oxygen - rich insulating regions in the material .",
    "a granular model was further proposed @xcite to describe the electronic properties of the i - alpdre polycrystalline samples .",
    "counter - arguments were raised later @xcite , based on the similarity of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the conductivity @xmath7 for polycrystalline ribbons and ingots , in spite of their different morphology .",
    "the main point of the controversy @xcite is that there is so far no physical picture which includes all the i - alpdre samples , i.e. single- and poly - grains .    in this paper , we comment on these recent publications and include unpublished results on a large number of melt - spun ribbons @xcite .",
    "we give a comprehensive overview of all types of i - alpdre samples ( single - grains , polycrystalline ingots , ribbons and thin films ) from the literature and our own work .",
    "in particular , quantitative chemical composition analysis of ribbons and ingots shed some new light on the origin of high resistivity values . our main point can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we provide arguments why the case for an extrinsic origin of the insulating behavior in i - alpdre samples @xcite is inconclusive .",
    "specifically , our chemical analysis shows that the composition range common to highly resistive ribbons and ingots is significantly different from that of the few metallic single - grains measured .",
    "detailed investigation of existing data disproves the granular electronic model @xcite , the role of porosity and questions the oxidation effect .",
    "2 .   despite difference in their microstructure",
    ", ribbons and ingots show insulating behavior , in agreement with previous report by poon and rapp @xcite . the presence of defects and chemical inhomogeneity influences the electrical properties ( especially at low temperature ) , but can not explain the difference between metallic and insulating samples .",
    "different types of i - alpdre samples have been produced ( see table [ tablesamples ] and ref . therein ) : single - grains , polycrystalline ingots , ribbons and thin films . note that the thin films have not been included in the recent discussions about the origin of the high resistivity values .",
    "fabrication of ingots @xcite and ribbons @xcite starts with arc - melting an ingot , containing the desired proportion of al , pd and re , as homogeneously as possible .",
    "the ingot then can be cut in small bars of typical size @xmath8 ( called `` ingots '' ) , or melt - spun into ribbons of typical size @xmath9 .",
    "thin films , typically 200 nm thick , were made by using either co - evaporation @xcite or sequential evaporation techniques @xcite . with the co - evaporation technique , al - pd and re sources are used , and depending on the substrate position during evaporation , different re content can be achieved . with the sequential evaporation technique , layers of pure elements are evaporated sequentially and the relative thickness of each layer determines the chemical composition of the film . for all these polycrystalline samples ,",
    "a subsequent annealing is necessary to get a sample of high structural quality and high resistivity values ( see subsection [ annealing ] ) .",
    "single - grains of millimetre size were grown by a slow cooling technique starting from a homogeneous melt of compositions close to the icosahedral phase domain @xcite .",
    "the single - grains can then be separated from the remaining melt by decanting at low temperature .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these results explain the choice of a different heat treatment : a slow heating rate ( @xmath10 ) up to a short ( @xmath11 ) plateau at a temperature just below the melting point ( @xmath12 ) to avoid any significant composition change and a slow cooling rate ( @xmath13 ) to room temperature .",
    "a slow cooling rate should favour a good relaxation of the structure . with such heat treatments",
    ", we were able to get ( almost ) homogeneous ribbons of high structural quality ( see picture at the bottom of figure [ figurea2 ] ) .",
    "these ribbons are called `` high t '' ribbons in the main text .",
    "the remaining composition fluctuations are then of the order of 1 at.% for the different elements ( see subsection [ compositionorder ] ) .",

    "histograms of the rrr values are presented in figure [ figurea3 ] .",
    "first , samples from the same batch can have broadely different rrr , between 2 and 200 .",
    "second , the @xmath16 value strongly influences the rrr distribution .",
    "annealing at @xmath19 , very close to the melting point of the alloy , gives rrr below 30 or above 130 but with no intermediate values . by comparison ,",
    "annealing at @xmath20 gives rrr values spread in the range 10 to 90 .",
    "this effect of @xmath16 on the rrr distribution may result from composition heterogeneity in the melt before melt - spining that produces ribbon of various average compositions .",
    "the effect of annealing will depend on how close @xmath16 is from the melting point of the ribbon ( that depends on its chemical composition ) .",
    "interestingly , we have observed that when no high rrr ribbons can be produced from an ingot , the ribbons are usually completely molten at @xmath19 , probably due to a significantly different composition from high rrr ribbons . in this regard , we have observed that batches of ribbons of low rrr usually melt at @xmath19 , probably due to a composition significantly different from that of high rrr ribbons .",

    "in our i - alpdre ribbons , the rrr varies from less than 2 to more than 200 , with a mit at rrr around 20 @xcite . but",
    "how good a parameter is rrr to describe the electronic properties of all our ribbons ?",
    "in other words , is there a one - to - one relation between the rrr values and the observed electronic properties , like the temperature dependence of the conductivity ?    the resistance ratio rrr is , by definition , the resistance ( resistivity , resp . ) at 4k divided by the resistance ( resistivity , resp . ) at 300k .",
    "this parameter has been extensively used to categorized the i - alpdre samples regarding the mit .",
    "usually , in disordered systems undergoing a mit , the driving parameter is known ( for example the dopant concentration in doped semi - conductors ) and can be used to categorize the samples .",
    "but in i - alpdre , the parameter(s ) that drive(s ) the mit is ( are ) not clearly identified and can not be quantified ( see section [ polycrystallinesamples ] ) . to categorize the samples ,",
    "one may use the room temperature resistivity or conductivity , or better the low temperature conductivity , which is more sensitive to the approach of the transition . for our annealed ribbons",
    "@xmath24 varies between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see figure [ figureb1 ] ) .",
    "however in most of polycrystalline samples , the resistivity can not be determined accurately because of the porosity of the ingots , the irregular shape of the ribbons , the uncertainties in the geometry of the electrical contacts , etc . in our ribbons ,",
    "we evaluate the uncertainty in the resistivity or conductivity values to be about 20% , which is too large to accurately sort out the samples .",
    "the rrr is a better parameter .",
    "it can be determined with a much higher precision ( it does not depends on geometrical factors ) and it increases rapidly close to the mit .",
    "the rrr was indeed sometimes used also in doped semiconductors since it is much more sensitive than the room temperature resistivity to changes in the dopant concentration around the mit ( see for example ref .",
    "the rrr of our ribbons varies by two orders of magnitude ( from 2 to 200 ) and its uncertainty is reasonable ( about 1% ) . within the experimental uncertainties on the resistivity ,",

    "most @xmath27 curves plotted in figures [ figureb2 ] , [ figureb3 ] and [ figureb4 ] display a steady evolution with the rrr , as reported previously @xcite , but this is not always the case .",
    "for example , in figure [ figureb3 ] , a ribbon of rrr = 25 has an `` anomalous '' temperature dependence compared to two other ribbons of similar rrr .",
    "the difference is more pronounced at low temperature .",

    "the @xmath37 values plotted in figure [ figureb5 ] increase from 1 to about 1.5 as a function of the rrr spaning a range 2 to 200 . the scattering in the data reflects the absence of an universal behavior for all the ribbons .",

    "the anomalous @xmath27 behaviors appear therefore related to larger chemical homogeneity in the ribbons .",

    "this simple experiment shows that the rrr value measured on a ribbon is the result of some complex electrical combinations of smaller size domains that have different rrr values .",
    "differences in the amplitudes or the typical length scales of these electrical inhomogeneities can obviously give differences in @xmath27 curves .",
    "we have also studied the electrical homogeneity in the thickness of the ribbons by measuring the @xmath27 curves on two ribbons of @xmath38 before and after one third of the film thickness was removed by polishing .",

    "the high temperature behavior ( above 50k ) is almost unchanged by polishing while the conductivity variations are less pronounced at low temperature .",
    "the @xmath27 curves of the polished ribbons are also anomalous compared to non polished ones of similar rrr .",
    "wether this result is related to the small chemical gradient , often observed in the thickness of the ribbons , or if it is due a disordered and more conducting layer induced at the surface of the ribbons by the mechanical polishing process remains an open question .",
