    "the characteristics of the host galaxies in which quasars reside may provide clues about the mechanisms that produce the observed energetic phenomena . to understand quasars",
    ", we would like to know answers to the following key questions : what kind of galaxies display the quasar phenomena ?",
    "how old are the galaxies ? do the hosts show signs of interactions or of star formation ? how are the quasars fed ?",
    "how long is a quasar active in any galaxy ?",
    "what fraction of galaxies show quasar phenomena ?",
    "the search for quasar host galaxies to help answer these questions was initiated by the pioneering work , using photographic plates , of kristian  ( 1973 ) and wyckoff et  al .",
    "the use of two - dimensional electronic detectors and charge coupled devices ( ccds ) made possible major improvements in the studies of quasar environments ; some representative papers are hutchings , janson , & neff  ( 1989 ) , hutchings & neff ( 1992 ) , dunlop et  al .",

    "these ground - based studies indicated the presence of host galaxies of many quasars and suggested that some of the hosts appeared to be disturbed by a gravitational encounter ( _ e.g. _ , hutchings & campbell 1983 , hutchings , crampton , & campbell 1984 ) .",
    "several spectroscopic studies of the nebulosity surrounding quasars have indicated that the nature of the emission is starlight from the underlying galaxy ( boroson , oke , & green 1982 ; boroson & oke 1982 , 1984 ; balick & heckman 1983 , kukula et  al .",
    "in particular , kukula et  al .",
    "obtained optical off - nuclear spectra of active galaxies and estimated the ages of the stellar populations using spectral synthesis models .",
    "the @xmath7 opened a new window to the study of quasar host galaxies .",
    "the high angular resolution of the @xmath7 has produced spectacular images of a number of quasars ( bahcall et  al .",

    ". 1995a ) has a companion galaxy located only 3.5  kpc in projection ( for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) from the quasar center .    in bahcall",
    "( 1996b , 1997 ) , we reported the results of our study of 20 nearby ( @xmath10 ) luminous quasars observed with the @xmath7-wfpc2 in f606w .",
    "the quasars in this local sample occur in diverse environments that include bright ellipticals , apparently normal elliptical and spiral galaxies , very faint hosts , and complex systems of gravitationally interacting components .",
    "the hosts of all six radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) in the sample are bright elliptical galaxies or interacting systems .",
    "however , contrary to widespread expectations based on ground - based observations of radio galaxies and seyfert galaxies ( see balick & heckman 1982 and references therein ) , the radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) occur in both elliptical _ and _ spiral galaxies .",
    "a tendency for high - luminosity quasar to occur in early - type galaxies was suggested by mcleod & rieke ( 1995b ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained by taylor et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on ground - based near - infrared imaging .",
    "only six rlqs are included in the local sample , which motivates us to obtain observations of more rlqs to better understand the connection between the radio emission and the quasar environment .    in this paper , we present @xmath7-wfpc2 observations of three additional rlqs : 3c  48 , b2  1425 + 267 , and 3c  345 .",
    "their redshifts are 0.367 , 0.366 , and 0.594 , respectively , higher than all the redshifts of the local sample quasars and comparable to the objects studied by hooper et  al .",

    "the quasars 3c  48 , b2  1425 + 267 , and 3c  345 were observed with the wide field / planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ; see biretta et  al .",

    "b2  1425 + 267 was placed near the center of the wide - field camera ccd  3 ( wf3 ) , while 3c  48 and 3c  345 were placed near the center of the planetary camera ( pc ) .",
    "four images of each quasar were obtained in each filter : two short exposures ( 50  s ) to investigate the small scale structure close to the nucleus , and two long exposures ( 1400  s in f555w and 1700  s in f814w ) to examine the parent galaxy , nearby galaxies , and other extended structure .",
    "the image scales of the pc and wf3 are 00455  pixel@xmath17 and 00996  pixel@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the adopted photometric zero - point for 1  @xmath18 is 24.58  mag for the f555w filter , and 24.13  mag for the f814w band ( biretta et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "narrow - band images , centered at redshifted [ o  iii]@xmath14 5007 emission , were obtained of 3c  48 using the linear ramp filter fr680n18 .",
    "the fr680n18 filter covers the wave - band from 6800   to 6921   ( rest wavelengths of 4974    to 5063   ) .",
    "the linear ramp filters are divided into four parallel strips where the central wavelength across each strip varies by @xmath19 .",
    "each ccd pixel is mapped to a unique central wavelength with a fwhm bandwidth of approximately 1.3% of the central wavelength ( biretta et  al .",
    "three exposures of 1100  s , 1300  s , and 1100  s were obtained .",
    "the initial data processing ( bias frame removal and flat - field calibration ) of the broad - band images was performed at the space telescope science institute with their standard software package .",
    "the narrow - band images were not flat - fielded in the stsci calibration pipeline ; we obtained the appropriate flat - field reference image from the @xmath7 archive and flattened the data .",
    "cosmic rays were identified by a pixel - by - pixel comparison of pairs of images of similar exposure time ; the intensity of a pixel containing a cosmic ray was replaced by the scaled value of the intensity of the pixel in the other image .",
    "the calibration of the [ o  iii ] image was done using the linear ramp filter calculator , and following standard procedures described in the stsci - wfpc2 world - wide - web home page .",
    "figure  [ figqso ] shows the three rlqs in the f555w and f814w bands .",
    "the host galaxies of 3c  48 and 3c  345 are clearly visible in the f814w images ; the host of b2  1425 + 267 is less prominent , but can be seen with confidence upon careful inspection of the f814w image .",
    "a journal of the observations is given in table  [ journal ] .",
    "the most challenging aspect of the data analysis is removal of the signal due to the quasar nucleus , which is a heavily saturated point source in the long exposures .",
    "we performed point - spread - function ( psf ) subtraction and subsequent analysis using the techniques described in bahcall et  al .",
    "briefly , we found a `` best - fit '' subtraction for each image by performing a @xmath20 minimization of the residuals in an annulus between @xmath21  away from the quasar center .",
    "we used empirical ( wfpc2 images of stars ) and model psfs constructed using the tiny  tim software ( krist 1993 ) , which resulted in host galaxy magnitudes that agreed within @xmath22  mag .",
    "subsequently , all analysis was performed using the tiny  tim subtracted images .",
    "figure  [ figqsosub ] shows the three quasars after subtraction ; galaxy parameters derived from these images are given in table  [ size ] .",
    "we determined host galaxy magnitudes by analyzing the psf - subtracted images using the three techniques detailed in bahcall et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) : aperture photometry outside of the nucleus ; one - dimensional fits of disk and de vaucouleurs profiles to azimuthally averaged radial profiles ; and two - dimensional fits of disk and de  vaucouleurs laws to the images themselves .",
    "the parameters and results of these analyses are given in table  [ magtab ] .",
    "the 1-d and 2-d fits are in excellent agreement .",
    "both approaches yield somewhat brighter magnitudes than the aperture photometry , as expected because the annular apertures omit light from the bright central parts of the hosts .    to check for a possible effect of the psf - subtraction on the color of the host galaxies we also performed two - dimensional fits on the unsubtracted quasar images : the amplitude of the point - source was fit simultaneously with the galaxy .",
    "the root - mean - square ( @xmath23 ) difference between the host galaxies magnitudes obtained with the two - dimensional fits to the unsubtracted and to the psf - subtracted quasar images is less than 0.3  mag ; the @xmath23 difference in color @xmath24 is 0.1  mag .",
    "figure  [ figgalcolors ] compares the measured colors , @xmath24 , for the three hosts with the predicted galaxy colors for different morphological types . for the normal galaxy colors , we use the results of fukugita et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "all the three host galaxies have @xmath25 colors at least 1  mag bluer than predicted for elliptical hosts at the same redshift .",
    "do the bluer colors indicate that the light from the quasar is contaminating the measurements ? to investigate this possibility , we measured the @xmath26 color in a large annular aperture centered on the quasar .",
    "the large aperture colors average only 0.13  mag redder than the two - dimensional fit ; @xmath24 = + 0.7 , + 1.0 , and + 1.3 for 3c  48 , b2  1425 + 267 , and 3c  345 , respectively , for annular aperture radii 14 to 55 , 30 to 40 , and 14 to 23 .",
    "we conclude that the bluer colors of the host galaxies are not the result of contamination by quasar light . in plotting the colors of the host galaxies shown in figure  [ figgalcolors ]",
    ", we used the average of the large annular aperture and the two dimensional fit photometry as the `` best - estimate '' , and one - half the difference between the two methods as a measure of the uncertainty .",
    "the measured colors suggest that the host galaxies of the three rlqs contain a younger stellar population than expected for elliptical or spiral galaxies at the redshifts of the quasars .    the estimated absolute @xmath12 and @xmath13 magnitudes of the quasar hosts",
    "are included in table  [ magtab ] ; the measured f555w and f814w magnitudes were transformed to @xmath12 and @xmath13 by applying @xmath27-corrections calculated by fukugita et  al .",
    "figure  [ figgalcolors ] shows that the @xmath24 color indices for the hosts of 3c  48 and b2  1425 + 267 are close to the predicted values for irregular galaxies at redshifts similar to the quasars , while for the host of 3c  345 , the measured color index is between that predicted for irregulars and scd galaxies .",
    "given the redshift of the quasars and the morphological type inferred from figure  [ figgalcolors ] , we used tables  6 to 8 from fukugita et  al .",

    "the radio loud - source 3c  48 was the first quasar to be optically identified ( matthews et  al .",
    "1961 ) . the first deep images of 3c  48 revealed extended emission , and suggested that quasars were associated with the centers of galaxies .",
    "3c  48 was also the first quasar to be shown to have a spatially resolved emission - line region ( wampler et  al .",
    "1975 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 broad band images , figures  [ figqso ] , [ figqsosub ] , and [ fig3c48knots ] , show that 3c  48 is surrounded by extensive nebulosity , permeated with brighter spots , probably h  ii regions , and traces of faint tidal tails that extend tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "the morphology of the host of 3c  48 indicates that strong gravitational interaction has taken place , confirming the evidence of merging suggested by previous studies ( see stockton & ridgway 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "the f555w and f814w images look similar to one another , although the tidal tails and extended nebulosity are more prominent in the f814w image .",
    "the f814w image of 3c  48 was published by canalizo , stockton & roth ( 1998 ) when they reported the discovery of a broad - absorption line quasar at @xmath31 located 41  southwest of 3c  48 .",
    "the tidal tail extends for @xmath32 kpc at pa @xmath33 ( we adopt the standard convention for position angle : north is at @xmath34 and east at @xmath35 ) ; it then curves almost in a right angle to the southwest for another @xmath36 kpc .",
    "the surface brightness of the tidal tail in the f814w images ranges from 23.2 mag  arcsec@xmath37 at @xmath38 4  ( 12 kpc ) from the quasar center to @xmath39 mag  arcsec@xmath37 at the outer parts .",

    "the morphology of this feature is complex ; on top of the higher - surface - brightness region there is a ring ( indicated by an arrow in the f555w image in figure  [ figqsosub ] ) .",
    "this ring - feature resembles ghost images seen in previous wfpc2 data ( pg  1307 + 085 , bahcall et  al .",

    "there are five knots in common between the [ o  iii ] and the broad - band images : c , i , l , o , q.      boroson & oke ( 1982 ) obtained spectra of the faint nebulosity 2  north and south of the center of 3c  48 .",

    "stellar absorption lines were also detected in the nebulosity ; the integrated light has both a @xmath43 color and absorption features indicative of middle to late a stars , suggesting that a massive star formation burst was triggered at @xmath44 years ago .",

    "in the f814w band image , the host of b2  1425 + 267 appears to be an elliptical galaxy , while in the f555w image , the host galaxy appears rounder and displays an arc - like feature at an average distance from the quasar of 15 . we have inspected dozens of wfpc2 images of stars in our search for a stellar psf to match the present quasar images ; none of the stellar images possess a feature like the arc seen in b2  1425 + 267 .",
    "the arc could , in principle , be a spiral arm or the debris trail of a small galaxy disrupted by the quasar host ; better images are required to reach a definitive conclusion . the results of the one - dimensional and two - dimensional fits are consistent with the host of b2  1425 + 267 being an elliptical galaxy . in the absence of definitive evidence to the contrary",

    "there are a number of suggestions in the literature that b2  1425 + 267 is an interacting system .",

    "1995b , to evaluate the statistical significance of the close companions observed , we built a comparison sample by counting galaxies in similar regions imaged at the same time and with the same instrumental configuration as each of the quasar fields .",
    "we counted galaxies in circular areas that are within 25 kpc ( at the quasar redshift ) of the quasar position shifted to ccd 2 and ccd 4 ; the quasar images in the local sample are all close to the center of ccd 3 of the wfc2 .",
    "in the 40 fields of ccd 2 and ccd 4 that accompany the twenty quasar images of the local sample , there are 8 galaxy companions that would have satisfied the _ a priori _ criteria for inclusion in our complete sample of close companions had they been found at the same coordinate positions in ccd 3 . for three fields ,",
    "the expected number of companions would be 0.60 .",
    "the poisson probability of finding five or more projected close galaxy companions as listed in table  [ comps ] is @xmath82    if we use the wf frames ( 8) that accompany the three rlqs to draw a control sample , we find 6 galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria . for three fields ,",
    "the expected number of companions would be 2.3 .",
    "the poisson probability of finding five or more projected close galaxy companions is @xmath83    we conclude that the presence of the projected close companions around the three rlqs is statistically significant .",
    "a similar result was found by bahcall ( 1995b,1997 ) and fisher et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the local sample .",
    "ellingson & yee ( 1994 ) measured the redshifts of 31 galaxies in the field of 3c  345 .",
    "eight of their galaxies have velocities within 3000  @xmath84 of the quasar .",
    "five of those galaxies are included in the @xmath7 images , although only one of them is close enough to appear in the field of view shown in figures  [ figqso ] and [ figqsosub ] .",
    "the five galaxies in the hst images known to be at the same distance as 3c  345 have measured colors @xmath24 that are consistent to the colors expected for normal galaxies of similar morphology and redshift .",
    "the main results of this study are : 1 ) the three rlqs studied have bright ( several @xmath85 ) host galaxies ; 2 ) the hosts of rlqs are , on average , about 1  mag more luminous than the hosts of rqqs ; and 3 ) the host colors @xmath24 are substantially bluer than expected for galaxies of similar morphological types at the same redshifts as the quasars .",
    "ground - based observations have produced contradictory evidence regarding the stellar populations of the quasar hosts galaxies .",
    "orndhal et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) report that quasar host galaxies have @xmath86 colors typical of late - type spirals , whereas kukula et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , concluded from near - infrared observations that the non - interacting hosts of rlqs are systems with old , red stellar populations .",
    "the ability of @xmath7 to address this question suggests that one should further investigate the colors of the hosts of the low - redshift quasars to determine whether 1 )  the host galaxies of luminous quasars are generally bluer than `` normal '' galaxies of similar morphological type , 2 )  host galaxies of rlqs are bluer than the hosts of rqqs , or  3 )  we are witnessing an extraordinary evolutionary effect in the colors of host galaxies .",
    "the @xmath7 images of 3c  48 reveal tidal tails extending for @xmath87  kpc , confirming previous suggestions of a strong gravitational interaction in this system .",
    "evidence for a massive host was presented earlier from ground - based imaging and spectroscopy ( boroson & oke 1982 ; malkan 1984 ; stockton & ridgway 1991 ) , observations of co ( scoville et  al . 1993 ) and far - infrared emission ( neugebauer et al . 1985 ) .",
    "the host galaxy of 3c  48 has @xmath88  mag , brighter than a typical brightest cluster galaxy ( @xmath89 , hoessel & schneider 1985 ; postman & lauer 1995 ) for @xmath90 and @xmath91 km s@xmath17mpc@xmath17 , and brighter than any host in the 20 member local sample .",
    "the hosts of b2  1425 + 267 and 3c  345 both have light distributions similar to luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , for b2  1425 + 267 , the presence of clumps and a faint galaxy lying within the host galaxy may indicate ongoing gravitational interaction .",
    "all nine rlqs we have studied ( either in the local sample or in this paper ) observed with @xmath7 have light distributions consistent with their hosts being elliptical galaxies , or occurring in interacting systems ; in some cases there is evidence for both .",
    "several groups have reported on a positive correlation between the luminosity of the active nucleus and that of the host galaxy ( mcleod & rieke 1994b , 1995a ; hooper et  al .",
    "1997 ; kotilainen et  al .",
    "mcleod & rieke ( 1995a , 1996 ) suggested that for low - redshift quasars brighter than @xmath92 , there is a minimum mass for the host galaxy that increases with increasing nuclear power , implying that a more luminous host galaxy is required to fuel a more luminous quasar .",
    "laor ( 1998 ) found a correlation between the luminosity of the quasar host galaxies in the local sample , and the inferred ( from h@xmath15 ) black hole mass .",
    "laor points out that the correlation is similar to the black hole mass versus bulge luminosity correlation found for normal galaxies ( magorrian et  al .",
    "1998 ) , suggesting that quasars reside in normal galaxies .",
    "figure  [ figmv ] shows the two - dimensional model absolute @xmath12 magnitudes ( from table  [ magtab ] ) of the host galaxies versus the absolute @xmath12 magnitudes of the quasars ( table  [ journal ] ) in the present study and in the local sample .",
    "the best linear fit to all the data yields : @xmath93 the linear correlation coefficient ( pearson s r ) indicates only a @xmath94 probability for the optical absolute magnitudes of the quasar and the host to be uncorrelated .",
    "the two most striking aspects of the figure  [ figmv ] visible by eye are : 1 )  there is essentially no correlation of @xmath95 and @xmath96 if we consider the rqqs and rqls separately ( probability of no correlation higher than @xmath97 ) , and 2 )  the rlqs have host galaxies that are about a magnitude brighter than the host galaxies of rqqs .    several previous studies have compared the luminosities of the host galaxies of rqqs and rlqs , but a consensus has not been achieved .",
    "there are suggestions that the hosts of rlqs are more luminous than the hosts of rqqs ( hutchings , janson & neff 1989 ; vron - cetty & woltjer 1990 ; mcleod & rieke 1995a , bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ) and also that there is no significant difference between the host luminosities ( dunlop et  al .",
    "1993 , orndahl et  al .",
    "1996 , taylor et  al .",
    "1996 , hooper et  al .",
    "1997 ) .    for the 23 members of our @xmath7 sample ( 20 in the local sample and 3 rlqs discussed in this paper ) ,",
    "the hosts of the rlqs are on average 1  mag brighter than the hosts of the rqqs .",
    "the average best - fit 2-d model magnitudes for the hosts of the 14 rqqs and 9 rlqs are : @xmath98 @xmath99 where the error given is the error of the mean ( the standard deviation is @xmath100 times larger ) .",
    "we applied the student s t - test to measure the significance of the difference of means .",
    "the probability that the host galaxies of the rlqs and rqqs have the same mean absolute @xmath12 magnitude is @xmath101 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test give a probability of @xmath102 for the distributions of the absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies of the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars to be the same .",
    "one must view these statistical tests with caution , however , as a glance at figure  [ figmv ] shows that the distributions of the optical luminosities of the rqqs and rlqs are significantly different .",
    "the four most optically luminous quasars in the entire sample are rlqs , and the average luminosity of the classes differs by nearly a magnitude @xmath103 @xmath104 if the luminosity of the host depended on the optical luminosity of the quasar , our sample would indicate a rqq / rlq difference even if the host galaxy luminosity was independent of quasar radio properties .",
    "we selected a subsample of quasars in which the rlqs and the rqqs have the same absolute magnitude range in order to limit the comparison to quasars with similar optical properties . in the range @xmath105 , there are 6 rqqs and 7 rlqs ; both subsamples of quasars have the same average absolute @xmath12 magnitudes ( @xmath106  mag ) .",
    "for those two subsamples the average best - fit 2-d model magnitudes of the host galaxies ( and error of the mean ) are : @xmath107 @xmath108 the host galaxies of rlqs in this group are on average 1.1  mag ( 3.1 @xmath109 ) brighter than the hosts of the rqqs , similar to the result obtained for the whole sample .",
    "could the difference be an artifact of the galaxy model used in the fitting ? this is a concern because of the extrapolations required to calculate the total luminosity ; the very center of the galaxy is masked by the quasar , and one can only fit out to a few ( at best ) effective radii or scale lengths . since we are restricted to data at intermediate radii , a de vaucouleurs model fit produces a total magnitude that is systematically brighter than the value obtained with an exponential disk , because the de vaucouleurs model rises more steeply in the very center and falls more slowly at large radii than does a disk model . for the 23 quasars in our sample , the two - dimensional gdv model gives magnitudes for the host that are on average 0.6  mag brighter than the exponential disk estimates .",
    "for the limited 13 member sample with @xmath110 , we fit all the hosts with a two - dimensional gdv galaxy model , and also with an exponential disk model . in both cases ,",
    "the hosts of the rlqs are on average 0.8  mag brighter than the hosts of the rqqs ( difference higher than 3@xmath109 ) , implying that the difference in the host luminosities of rlqs and rqqs is real .",
    "figure  [ figradio ] shows the radio luminosity of the quasars at 6  cm , from the vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) catalog , versus the two - dimensional model absolute visual magnitudes of the host galaxies .",
    "figure  [ figradio ] includes 9 rlqs and 8 rqqs for which vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) list a detected emission at 6  cm .",
    "this figure shows that the strongest radio sources tend to occur in more luminous host galaxies .",
    "as seen in figure  [ figmv ] , there is no trend for correlation inside the two radio classes .",
    "the trend shown in figure  [ figradio ] can be represented by a linear regression : @xmath111 the linear correlation coefficient indicates that there is less than a 0.1% probability of the luminosity of the host and the quasar radio power being uncorrelated .",
    "we conclude that the difference in the luminosities of the host galaxies of the rlqs and rqqs is significant and robust .",
    "the apparent correlation between the optical luminosities of the host and the quasar ( figure  [ figmv ] ) is mainly due to the rlqs occurring in brighter galaxies than the rqqs .",
    "the results suggest that the radio emission of the quasars is connected with the magnitude / mass of the host galaxy , indicating that only galaxies brighter than a certain limit would be able to harbor a radio - loud quasar .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of our colleague and friend jerome kristian , an outstanding scientist who played a key role in the development of this field of research .",
