    "where are the baryons , the ordinary non - exotic matter of the universe ? if we consider the universe at redshift two , a consistent picture emerges : the amount of mass seen directly by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in stellar systems is very small ( @xmath6 [ for h=0.70 ] ; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) , when compared either to the amount seen in the local universe or to the critical cosmological density .",
    "but the amount of hydrogen and helium observed as absorption lines in the lyman alpha forest is considerable .",
    "recent analyses ( rauch 1997 ; weinberg 1997 ) give @xmath7 from observations of the lyman alpha forest at redshift two , where @xmath8 is the density in units of the critical density , @xmath9km / s / mpc , and @xmath10 is adopted for the last term in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the above quoted lower limit on @xmath8 might be too conservative by as much as a factor of @xmath11 , due primarily to the uncertainty in the observationally determined metagalactic radiation field .",
    "the observed light - element ratios , combined with standard nucleosynthesis , allow to compute the expected baryon density for standard models ( burles & tytler 1998 ) as @xmath12 the approximate consistency between these two completely independent methods of estimating the baryon density is reassuring , as is the fact that theoretical models incorporating ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and standard theory for the growth of structure reproduce , in great detail , numerous features ( column density dependence , redshift dependence , spatial correlations , etc ) of the observed lyman alpha forests ( cen 1994 ; zhang 1995 ; miralda - escud 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "but at redshift zero , in the present day universe , every analysis ( e.g. , fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1997 ) indicates that , after summing over all well observed contributions , the local baryon density appears to be far lower than indicated by equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : @xmath13 for @xmath10 .",
    "thus , either most of the baryons in the present day universe are yet to be detected or a serious error has been made in the arguments that led to equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . several authors ( e.g. , wolfe 1995 ) have noticed that the mass density seen in the damped lyman alpha systems at moderate redshift ( @xmath14 ) approximately corresponds to the mass density in the stellar component of galaxies at @xmath15 . while important and roughly true , this point does not help us much , since only a small fraction ( approximately @xmath16 ) of the lyman alpha forest is seen in the neutral high column density damped systems and , correspondingly , @xmath17 is about @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the puzzling question remains .",
    "where are the baryons in the universe today ? there have been a number of proposals to account for the missing baryons ( oneil 1997 ; burkert & silk 1997 ; bristow & phillips 1994 ) .",
    "now , the whereabouts and state of those missing baryons can be computed from standard initial conditions , in realistic large - scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we have concluded that a substantial fraction of the missing baryons are to be found in intergalactic gas in a temperature range @xmath19k , where they have been difficult to detect and which we call  warm / hot gas \" .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief descriptions of the simulations is presented in  2 .",
    "results are given in  3 and  4 concludes the paper with a discussion of the robustness of the results and ways to detect this warm / hot gas .",
    "this result is based on a computation of the evolution of the gas in a cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ; the model is normalized to both the microwave background temperature fluctuations measured by cobe on large scales ( bunn & white 1997 ) and the observed abundance of clusters of galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , cen 1998 ) , and it is close to both the concordance model of ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ) and the model indicated by the recent high redshift supernova results ( riess 1997 ) .",
    "the relevant model parameters are : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath10 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 tensor mode contribution to the cmb fluctuations on large scales .",
    "two simulations with box sizes of @xmath26mpc are made , each having @xmath27 cells and @xmath28 dark matter particles .",
    "the conclusions drawn in this paper are not significantly affected by the finite resolution . although based on simulations of a specific model , we believe that the result is generic and would occur in any model consistent with other large scale structure results .",
    "the description of the numerical methods of the cosmological hydrodynamic code and input physical ingredients will be presented elsewhere .",
    "to briefly recapitulate , we follow three components separately and simultaneously : dark matter , gas and galaxies , where the last component is created continuously from the former two during the simulations in places where real galaxies are thought to form as dictated mostly by local physical conditions . self - consistently , feedback into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from young stars in the  galaxies \" is allowed , in three related forms : supernova thermal energy output , uv photon output and mass ejection from the supernova explosions .",
    "the model reproduces the observed uv background and metallicity distributions among others .",
    "before describing our detailed results , it is useful to give a simple and surprisingly accurate order of magnitude physical argument . in all standard pictures for the growth of structure there",
    "is imprinted at an early time a spectrum of perturbations , with the amplitude of the fluctuations being largest at small scales and smaller at larger scales . after decoupling at @xmath29 ,",
    "all waves grow ( due to self - gravity ) roughly as @xmath30 .",
    "they have reached the nonlinear length and mass scales of @xmath31mpc and @xmath32 , respectively , by @xmath15 ( our fiducial model is adopted for this illustration ) .",
    "when a perturbation of a given scale @xmath33 collapses at time @xmath34 due to gravity , geometry indicates it must do so with a velocity @xmath35 and , as opposite sides of the collapsing perturbation meet and attempt to cross one another , a shock is generated behind which the sound speed is @xmath36 . combining these simple arguments and noting that @xmath37 gives us @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a numerical constant and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the hubble constant and nonlinear length scale at epoch @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "applying this to the current epoch ( with @xmath43 ) gives @xmath44km / s , which corresponds to a temperature of @xmath45k .",
    "this should correspond to the typical temperature of recently collapsed ( i.e. high density ) objects , with the global mean temperature somewhat lower . note that @xmath39 is only a dimensionless number to indicate the nature of the scaling relation and is not intended to model shock jump conditions .",
    "figure 1 shows the mean computed temperature as a function of redshift from the @xmath46mpc@xmath47 ^ 3 $ ] simulation .",
    "the volume weighted average temperature at @xmath15 is @xmath48k , the mass ( @xmath49 ) weighted average temperature is @xmath50k ( the value given by equation 1 with @xmath43 ) and the @xmath51 weighted average ( roughly speaking emission weighted ) is @xmath52k .",
    "thus , the high density regions are in just the temperature domain indicated by equation ( 4 ) with the constant taken to be unity .",
    "figure 1 shows that equation ( 4 ) ( adopting @xmath43 ) in fact roughly tracks the density weighted averages from redshift three onwards , confirming the simple physical picture presented earlier .",
    "now let us examine the results in greater detail , dividing the gas into three temperature ranges ( 1 ) @xmath53k ( the normal x - ray emitting gas , predominantly in collapsed and virialized clusters of galaxies ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath54k@xmath55k gas , which we will call the warm / hot gas and is mainly in unvirialized regions ; ( 3 ) @xmath56k warm gas , which is seen in optical studies both in absorption and emission . a last component ( 4 )",
    "is the cold gas that has been condensed into stellar objects , which we designate  galaxies \" , and which will contain stars and cold gas .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of these four components , and the results are consistent with our other knowledge .",
    "most of the volume is always filled with warm ( lyman alpha forest ) gas , but the mass fraction in this component declines from @xmath57 at @xmath58 to @xmath59 at @xmath15 , consistent with the hst observed clearing of the forest and of low - z redshift @xmath1 cloud gas ( shull 1996,1997 ) .",
    "note that at low reshift denser gas in and around galaxy halos may make significant contributions to the observed low redshift @xmath1 clouds , which compensates somewhat the decrease of the warm component and incidentally leads to a leveloff of @xmath1 clouds at low redshift ( bahcall 1996 ) .",
    "the hot component increases in mass fraction , reaching @xmath60 by mass at @xmath15 , and is consistent with observations of the local properties of the x - ray emitting great clusters ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1994 ; bryan & norman 1998 ) . the condensed component remains small ( 12% and is possibly overestimated in this simulation ) , consistent with the known mass density in galaxies .",
    "but we wish to focus attention on the solid circles in figure 2b : the warm / hot gas rises dramatically in abundance with increasing time and dominates the mass balance by @xmath15 , reaching @xmath61 of the noncondensed mass fraction or 47% of the total baryons .    figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of this gas .",
    "we see a filamentary structure ( in green ) where , at the high density nodes ( red ) ,  galaxies \" have formed or been collected .",
    "the spectral features of this warm / hot gas are in the euv and soft x - ray , which are very difficult to observe at low redshift because of the interstellar medium in the galaxy . in the soft x - ray the galaxy is a strong source of emission at an effective temperature of @xmath62k , whereas the neutral hydrogen in the galaxy prevent observations of the euv at @xmath63a .",
    "finally , figure 4 shows the distribution of emission of the gas , which convolves the density weighted distribution with the familiar cooling curve @xmath64 .",
    "we see , at @xmath15 , two peaks , one at @xmath65k and a higher and broader one at @xmath66k , with a broad flat valley in between .",
    "note that cooling due to metals is included in the calculation , where metals are produced self - consistently in the simulation .",
    "the computed metallicities are consistent with observations where comparisons can be made .",
    "how robust are these results to variation of model assumptions ? we believe that any model which is consistent with other well measured local universe observations would give essentially the same result .",
    "the reason for this is simply that the temperature is determined by the nonlinear mass scale ( equation 4 ) , and that , in turn is close to the @xmath67mpc scale which fixes the abundance of rich clusters and is fairly robustly determined to a narrow range ( e.g. , cen 1998 ) : @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "only a very small extrapolation is needed to go from this well observed scale to the nonlinear scale , so the estimated temperature of collapsed regions that we find will be common to all models based on the gravitational growth of structure - as normalized to local cluster observations .",
    "in fact , analysis of our earlier work ( ostriker & cen 1995 ) covering nearly a dozen different models ( at lower resolution ) has shown that from one - half to two - thirds of all baryons in all models are consistently and robustly in this warm / hot gas at @xmath15 .",
    "we also show in figure 2b the warm / hot component for two other models , an open cdm model with @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( dotted curves ) , and a mixed hot and cold dark matter model with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( dashed curves ) computed completely independently by bryan & norman ( 1998 ) . yet",
    ", their results are in excellent agreement with ours .",
    "the density fluctuation amplitude normalization of their mixed dark matter model is somewhat below that required to produce the abundance of local galaxy clusters .",
    "therefore , an appropriately normalized mixed dark matter model would yield the warm / hot gas fraction in still better agreement with the other two models .",
    "how robust are these results to the input modeling physics ?",
    "in addition to gravity and hydrodynamics , there are three major pieces of relevant input physics : the meta - galactic radiation field , energy deposition into igm from young galaxies and metal cooling .",
    "all these three pieces of physics are already included in the simulations examined here .",
    "let us discuss them in turn .",
    "first , changing the meta - galactic radiation field would not make any significant difference to the baryons at the relevant temperature and density ranges , because the warm / hot gas is heated primarily by collisions .",
    "second , energy feedback from young galaxies is secondary compared to shock heating due to structure collapse .",
    "an estimate can be made : the equivalent kinetic energy input per unit mass due to supernova energy feedback , averaged over all baryons , is @xmath74(km / s)@xmath75 , or @xmath76k , [ where @xmath77 is the mass fraction of baryons that is formed into galaxies by @xmath15 ( open squares in figure 2b ) , and @xmath78 is the fraction of energy that supernovae deposit into igm in terms of total rest mass ] , which is compared to the mass - weighted temperature at z=0 , @xmath79k ( dotted curve in figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , it seems that supernova feedback contributes about @xmath80 in the overall energy budget .",
    "finally , the metal cooling time is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the density of the gas in units of the global baryonic mean and @xmath84 is the cooling rate ( bohringer & hensler 1989 ) . assuming a typical metallicity of @xmath85 solar , we obtain @xmath86 , at @xmath87k , respectively , where @xmath88 is the current hubble time . for most of the warm / hot gas , @xmath83 is about a few .",
    "therefore , most of the warm / hot gas has not cooled significantly and will not be able to cool in the next hubble time , especially considering the steady input of gravitational energy .",
    "a small fraction of gas at the lower end of the temperature range ( @xmath89 ) has , of course , cooled to form galaxies and a smaller fraction will continue to cool to form more galaxies in the next hubble time .",
    "but most of the gas , including part of the gas that may otherwise be able to cool , will likely be incorporated into larger and hotter systems , due to merger as well as breaking of still longer waves .    how can this gas be observed ?",
    "cen ( 1995 ) argued , from a less accurate computation than the present one , that a significant fraction of the soft x - ray background @xmath90kev was due to this warm / hot gas and that this could be verified by association of this soft x - ray background radiation field with relatively nearby large scale structure features , as well as by the soft x - ray angular auto - correlation function ( soltan 1996 ) .",
    "a more accurate prediction is now underway .",
    "recent rosat observations of the soft x - ray background ( wang & mccray 1993 ) seem to hint the existence of this warm / hot gas .",
    "another useful method of detecting the soft x - ray background is to search for shadows cast by nearby neutral hydrogen - rich galaxies ( wang & ye 1996 ; barber , roberts , & warwick 1996 ) using axaf .",
    "second , hellsten ( 1998 ) , on the basis of simulations similar to those reported on here , have predicted the existence of an x - ray absorption forest due to ionized oxygen ( o vii 574  ev line ) in the warm / hot temperature range .",
    "perna & loeb ( 1998 ) have also made similar calculations based on simplified models for the igm .",
    "work underway with t. tripp and e. jenkins indicates that vacuum uv absorption lines ( ovi 1032a,1038a doublets ) should be detectable by current instruments due to gas in this temperature range primarily in the distant outskirts of galaxies .",
    "third , strong soft x - ray emission lines from highly ionized species ( such as o viii 653  ev line ) should also be observable ( jahoda 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "fourth , recent work on euv observations ( mittaz , lieu , & lockman 1998 ) may indicate emission structures coincident with or projected onto rich x - ray clusters due to the warm / hot component as seen figure 3 .",
    "fifth , the warm / hot gas may show up as very broad , relatively weak ( mostly having @xmath91@xmath92 with a small fraction at higher column densities ) , low redshift @xmath1 clouds but observations more sensitive than current ones ( shull 1996,1997 ) are required .",
    "finally , this gas may be detected through cross - correlating soft x - ray background ( refregier , helfand , & mcmahon 1997 ) or sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( refregier , spergel , & herbig 1998 ) with galaxies .",
    "overall , on the basis of preliminary computations ( by scaling @xmath8 down from @xmath93 to @xmath94 using latest observations and noting the @xmath95 scaling relation ) , we expect that @xmath2 of the extragalactic soft x - ray background ( at @xmath3kev ) comes from this diffuse warm / hot gas : @xmath96kev / sec / cm@xmath75/kev / sr is compared to the wang - ye ( 1996 ) estimate of @xmath98kev / sec / cm@xmath75/kev / sr for the diffuse extragalactic sxrb .",
    "half is emitted by structures at redshift @xmath4 and three - quarters from @xmath5 ; so one should be able to identify the optical features associated with the emitting gas . in sum , several experiments using existing or planned facilities have the possibility of detecting , in a relatively precise way , the abundance and cosmic distribution of this warm / hot gaseous component of the universe , which is likely to contain most of the baryonic matter at the current epoch .",
