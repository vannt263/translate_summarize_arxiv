    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars develop strong mass loss at rates up to @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 or more .",
    "the optical light of agb stars with the highest @xmath0 is almost entirely absorbed by their dusty circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) , and re - emitted at longer wavelengths .",
    "these obscured agb stars become very bright infrared ( ir ) objects , outshining any other star in a galaxy except for a few red supergiants ( rsgs ) . during a brief period in their lives , they loose 50 to 80% of their initial mass .",
    "this makes them important contributors to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism )  they are possibly the main sources of dust particles in the universe .",
    "individual galaxies differ in their metal content as a result of different star formation histories .",
    "for instance , two of our nearest neighbours , the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc & smc ) have current metallicities a factor @xmath5 and @xmath6 less than the average metallicity in the milky way ( @xmath7solar ) . when pursuing a quantitative description of the history of star formation and chemical enrichment within a galaxy , it is essential to correctly take into account the mass loss from agb stars and rsgs .",
    "this requires the dust - to - gas ratios in their cses to be known .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "2 formulae are derived for deriving mass - loss rates and dust - to - gas ratios from measurements of optical depths and either luminosities or expansion velocities .",
    "3 introduces samples of obscured agb stars in the mcs and in the milky way and addresses the near - ir colours of their circumstellar envelopes .",
    "relative mass - loss rates and dust - to - gas ratios are determined in sect .",

    "5 . in appendix",
    "a new identifications of mass - losing agb stars with iras point sources in the lmc are presented and in appendix b expansion velocities are discussed .",
    "the optical depth @xmath8 is proportional to the column density and dust - to - gas mass ratio @xmath1 .",
    "the column density is proportional to the total mass density @xmath9 and inner radius @xmath10 of the dusty cse .",
    "the dust grains in the dust - formation zone are assumed to be in radiative equilibrium with the incident stellar radiation field , keeping the effective temperature @xmath11 and the dust condensation temperature @xmath12 fixed .",

    "the drift velocity  the velocity difference between the gas and dust fluids  is neglected , i.e.  gas and dust are assumed to be well coupled ( cf .",
    "lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) . gas pressure and wind - driving mechanisms other than radiation pressure on dust",
    "are neglected as well , although they become important for wind speeds below a few km s@xmath4 ( e.g.  steffen et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "it follows that the optical depth @xmath16 the constant of proportionality includes a factor @xmath17 , the wavelength - dependent opacity of the dust , and a temperature dependence as @xmath18 .    in a radiation - driven outflow the matter - momentum flux is coupled with the stellar photon - momentum flux via the momentum equation ( gail & sedlmayr 1986 ) @xmath19 with @xmath8 the flux - weighted optical depth . in general , the ratio of @xmath8 and @xmath20 depends on the mass - loss rate .",
    "detailed computations such as those presented in habing et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , however , show that this dependence vanishes for @xmath21 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , which applies to the class of obscured agb stars under study here ( van loon et al .",

    "these samples are based on the identification of optical and near - ir counterparts of point sources detected at 12 and/or 25 @xmath38 m by iras .",
    "the smc photometry is mainly from groenewegen & blommaert ( 1998 ) .",
    "bolometric magnitudes for the smc stars were determined in the same way as for the lmc stars by spline fitting to the spectro - photometric energy distribution ( see whitelock et al .",

    "also included are two newly identified obscured agb stars in the lmc ( appendix a ) .",
    "the reddest , optically thickest stars , with @xmath39 mag , are found among agb stars with @xmath40 to @xmath41 mag .",
    "no such red objects are known in the mcs among the brightest agb stars with @xmath42 mag , nor amongst the rsgs .",
    "this is partly because bolometrically fainter stars have smaller inner radii of the dusty cse and smaller expansion velocities , yielding larger @xmath8 ( eq .  ( 1 ) ) and redder @xmath37 colours at a given mass - loss rate .",
    "whitelock et al .  (",
    "1994 ) have searched for long period variables ( lpvs ) in the south galactic cap ( sgc ) .",
    "their sample consists of both optically bright and obscured agb stars .",
    "their @xmath37 colours are plotted versus bolometric luminosity in fig .  2 ( the mira @xmath43-@xmath24 relation was applied ) , where different symbols are used according to the 25 @xmath38 m flux density measured if the star were at the distance of the lmc .",
    "the obscured stars that are detected by iras in the lmc have @xmath44 jy .",
    "their sgc equivalents have very red @xmath37 colours , though not redder than the reddest in the lmc ( crosses ) .",
    "optically bright agb stars in the sgc sample have typically @xmath45 and @xmath46 to @xmath47 mag .",
    "the mc samples do not contain such objects because their mid - ir emission is too faint to have been detected by iras at the distances of the mcs . on the other hand ,",
    "the sgc sample is devoid of the brightest agb stars with @xmath42 mag as well as rsgs , because in the milky way such massive stars are preferentially found in the galactic plane .",
    "there is a cluster of sgc stars with @xmath48 and @xmath49 mag ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "these stars clearly show circumstellar reddening , but the mid - ir emission from their cses is just below the detection limit of iras when placed at the distance of the lmc .",
    "this leaves open the possibility of the existence in the lmc of a potentially large population of agb stars with moderate mass - loss rates and luminosities .",
    "indeed , in paper iii several field stars were found that are not related to a nearby iras source but that nevertheless had near - ir colours indicative of reddening .",
    "recent iso observations confirm the presence of this agb population ( loup et al .  1999 ) .",
    "wood et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find lpvs in the galactic centre with k - band magnitudes from 5 to 13 after correction for interstellar extinction . at the distance of the lmc",
    "this would yield k - band magnitudes from 9 to 17 , i.e.  within the sensitivity of the searches in papers ii & iii and in groenewegen & blommaert ( 1998 ) .",
    "the interstellar extinction corrected @xmath37 colours of the galactic centre lpvs average @xmath5 mag and are @xmath50 mag maximum , similar to the @xmath37 colours of the obscured agb stars in the lmc .",
    "wood et al.argue that their sample includes stars with initial metallicities a few times solar , and blommaert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) indeed find very red objects with @xmath51 mag as inferred from their k- and l - band photometry .",
    "groenewegen et al .  (",
    "1998 ) observed and modelled obscured carbon stars in the milky way .",
    "they used the @xmath43-@xmath24 relation for carbon miras to infer distances to the individual stars , that are found to be typically within 2 kpc from the sun .",
    "their two most obscured carbon stars have @xmath52 and 8.0 mag .",
    "they also compiled a sample of oxygen - rich stars with near - ir photometry , pulsation periods and expansion velocities , without overlap with the sgc and galactic centre samples .",
    "the most obscured of these m stars have @xmath53 mag .",
    "in determining mass - loss rates and dust - to - gas ratios in the mcs one can rely on the use of luminosities and eliminate @xmath15 from eq .",
    "luminosities are difficult to measure for stars in the milky way , however , due to unknown distances and severe interstellar extinction .",
    "often the mira @xmath43-@xmath24 relation is applied to infer distances to individual stars , but this relation possibly breaks down for stars whose stellar mantles have been significantly reduced due to mass loss ( e.g.  blommaert et al .  1998 ; wood et al .",
    "1998 ; wood 1998 ) , or obscured agb stars may fall on other , parallel sequences ( bedding & zijlstra 1998 ; wood 1999 ) . for the milky way stars ,",
    "@xmath24 is eliminated from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , leaving @xmath15 to be measured . because @xmath15 has been measured for only a few lmc stars , eq .",
    "( 3 ) will be used for the remaining lmc stars to estimate @xmath15 from @xmath24 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "although these estimates are likely to be accurate within a few km s@xmath4 , the contribution of the uncertainty in @xmath15 is enlarged by a factor three in eq .",
    "( 4 ) & ( 5 ) are used here to compare the combination of mass - loss rate and dust - to - gas ratio between the mcs and between the lmc and the milky way , respectively .",
    "if the mass - loss rate depends on luminosity but not on initial metallicity and if the luminosity distributions of the stars in these samples are identical  implying identical star formation histories  then the distributions over the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are identical except for possible offsets due to different mean values for @xmath1 among the different samples .",
    "the stars within each of the samples are likely to cover a range in initial metallicities due to their different progenitor masses and hence different formation epochs .",
    "similar star formation histories , however , are anticipated to result in similar distributions over initial metallicity , and it is therefore meaningful to assign a mean initial metallicity and a mean value for @xmath1 to each of the samples .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in conclusion , the comparison between the dust - to - gas ratios and mass - loss rates of obscured agb stars in the smc , lmc , and milky way suggests that the dust - to - gas ratios in the outflows of obscured agb stars depend approximately linearly on the initial metallicity .",
    "this was suspected by habing et al.(1994 ) but still awaited observational support .",
    "the total ( gas+dust ) mass - loss rates of obscured agb stars show a much weaker dependence on initial metallicity .",
    "no appreciable differences are found between these relations for obscured m - type agb stars and obscured carbon stars .",
    "periods of weather conditions that were too poor for long - term photometric monitoring at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) at sutherland , south africa , in december 1997 were used to search for near - ir counterparts of iras point sources in the direction of the lmc .",
    "this was done on the 1.9 m telescope with the mk  iii scanning photometer in the k - band .",
    "an aperture of @xmath54 was used , chopping and nodding with a throw of @xmath55 .",
    "the search was limited to objects brighter than @xmath56 mag .",
    "the areas around five iras point sources suspected to be obscured agb stars ( paper i ) were searched .",

    "there are two much brighter near - ir sources with moderately red @xmath61 nearby , of which the third listed in table a1 is a cluster of @xmath62 stars within a diameter of @xmath63 .",
    "the proposed near - ir counterparts of li - lmc987 and 1795 have near - ir colours consistent with red giants without mass loss and are probably not associated with the iras sources .",

    "li - lmc1522 is also identified as a dust - enshrouded star , with ir colours suggesting oxygen - rich dust .",

    "<S> the properties of their circumstellar envelopes can be explained in a consistent way if , both for obscured m - type agb stars and for obscured carbon stars , the total ( gas+dust ) mass - loss rate @xmath0 depends only weakly on initial metallicity whilst the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath1 depends approximately linearly on initial metallicity . </S>"
