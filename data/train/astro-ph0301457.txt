    "dwarf galaxies account for only a small fraction of the total mass and light of galaxy clusters ; nevertheless , they are a key element in the evolution of galaxy clusters .",
    "evidence is gathering that evolution of rich clusters can be gauged by its present population of dwarf galaxies .",
    "tidal interactions which whittle away at ( moore et al.1996 , bekki , couch , & drinkwater 2001a ) and even disrupt entire systems ( gregg & west 1998 ) can liberate debris from bright galaxies , giving rise to large populations of dwarf galaxies ( lopez - cruz et al.1996 ) . in the opposite direction , dwarfs may lose their individual identities by accreting onto the central elliptical , creating cd galaxies .",
    "this ebb and flow of the dwarf galaxy population may be episodic and a measure of the dynamical state of a cluster ( lopez - cruz et al .",
    "1996 ) , and a complete understanding of galaxy clusters must incorporate not only the present state of dwarf galaxies but also their life histories .    the _ fornax cluster spectroscopic survey _ ( fcss ; drinkwater et al .",
    "2000a ) is using the 2-degree field 400-fiber spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope to obtain spectra for every object down to @xmath0 in a @xmath1 area centered on the fornax cluster , about 14000 targets in all .",
    "the fcss is unique in targeting _",
    "all objects , stellar and nonstellar _ on schmidt plates .",
    "this complete sample of galaxies over a large range of magnitude and surface brightness will permit study of the luminosity function and dynamics of fornax in greater detail than has been done previously ( e.g. , ferguson 1989 ) .",
    "now @xmath2 finished , the most exciting find from the fcss is the identification of seven objects from the unresolved `` stellar '' targets which are `` ultra - compact dwarf '' ( ucd ) cluster members with @xmath3 , and sizes @xmath4  pc .",
    "distributed widely across the cluster , the ucds are not , as a class , associated with bright galaxies ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2000b ; phillipps et al .",
    "the ucds are @xmath5 magnitudes brighter than the largest globular clusters in ngc  1399 ( figure  1 ) and have absorption - line spectra indicative of older , moderately metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "all are classified as stellar in schmidt plate material , which provides the target lists for the fcss , and all but the brightest ucd are still essentially unresolved in ground - based ccd images in @xmath6 seeing ( figure  1 ) .",
    "such objects are passed over by galaxy redshift surveys , rejected because of their stellar appearance .",
    "because the 7 ucds are near our spectroscopic survey magnitude limit , we predict that many fainter ucds exist in the cluster .",
    "though tiny and hard to find , the ucds provide interesting insights into the longer term evolution of galaxies in a dense environment .",
    "our favored interpretation of ucds is that they are the durable central nuggets of nucleated dwarf ellipticals which have had their fragile , puffy halos tidally stripped or `` threshed '' by repeated close and intense encounters with the largest galaxies in the cluster ( bekki , et al .",
    "both the stripped halos , accounting for @xmath7 of a de s total light ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ; freeman 1993 ) , and the surviving nuclei are dispersed into intracluster space or added to the envelopes of the brighter galaxies , especially cds like ngc  1399 .",
    "such phenomena are not unique to rich clusters ; tidally liberated streams of stars have been recognized around m31 and the milky way ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "2001a , b ) , and can perhaps account for the origin of m32 ( bekki et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "we have obtained hst stis images of 5 ucds plus a comparison de in fornax .",
    "these images do just resolve the ucd cores and show that they are structurally a good match to the nucleus of the comparison de , after model subtraction of the de halo ( figure  2 ) .",
    "to further investigate the possible links among ucds , des , and globular clusters , we have obtained echelle spectra of 5 of the ucds at the vlt using uves and keck with esi .",
    "when placed in the m@xmath8@xmath9 plane along with ellipticals , des , and galactic+m31 globular clusters ( figure  3 ) , the ucds appear to be more closely related to brighter ellipticals than to globulars .",
    "the bright early types follow the well known @xmath10 faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relation , while the globulars lie along a different locus with @xmath11 ( djorgovski et al.1997 ) .",
    "the ucds , though lying closer to globulars in this plane , fall along the extrapolated faber - jackson relation and are an order of magnitude too bright for their velocity dispersions to join the globular cluster relation .",
    "if the threshing model of bekki et al .  ( 2001a ) is correct and the ucds have lost their envelopes  98% of their light  while the nuclei are little affected , then the ucds would have begun life @xmath12 magnitudes brighter , in the regime of the nucleated dwarf ellipticals ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the ucds may hold the answer to the old puzzle of why cd and some other cluster ellipticals have such high `` specific frequencies '' of globular clusters , factors of several or more greater than globular populations around spirals like the milky way . during the gravitational interactions which remove their halos , many ucds",
    "may be captured by the central elliptical where they can masquerade as globulars , accounting for the brightest cd halo star clusters . threshing",
    "may also be able to explain the rest of the specific frequency excess in cds .",
    "figure  2 shows fcc303 , a typical de ; in its halo are @xmath13 globulars ( seen as point sources at the distance of fornax ) .",
    "the specific frequency of des is high ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , comparable to that of a typical cd .",
    "recycled de halo material accumulated by a cd over a hubble time provides a natural explanation for the large globular cluster populations of giant ellipticals in clusters . through such tidal interactions in rich environments the evolution of bright galaxies and the cluster as a whole",
    "are intimately linked to the population of dwarf galaxies .",
