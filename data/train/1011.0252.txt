    "when single neutral atoms or quantum dots are strongly coupled to quantized electromagnetic fields through dipole - interaction inside a high-@xmath0 cavity , it has long been a central paradigm for the study of open quantum systems and plays a leading role in defining research goals .",
    "this coherent interaction is referred to cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which offers an almost ideal system for the generation of entangled states and implementation of small - scale quantum information processors recently qed1,qed2 .",
    "the reason is that atoms are particularly well suited for storing qubits in long - lived internal states , and photons are the best qubit carrier for fast and reliable communication over long distances .    for cavity qed study ,",
    "three representative optical microcavities have been proposed and investigated up to the present @xcite : the conventional fabre - perot(fp)-type cavities consisting of two concave dielectric mirrors at a distance of tens of microns , the nanoscale optical cavities in photonic crystal where a dot or line defect is introduced , and the dielectric optical microcavities supporting whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) . over past few years , the strong coupling regime ( i.e. , the light - matter coherent interaction strength exceeds both the cavity and dipole decay rates ) has been realized using either fp - type microcavities @xcite or photonic crystal nanocavities @xcite .",
    "experiments with single atoms have been at the forefront of these advances with the use of optical fp resonators .",
    "nevertheless , the extremely technical challenges will be typically involved in further improving the resonators and scaling to large numbers of microcavities .",
    "thus there is an increasing interest in the development of alternative microcavity systems .",
    "wgms in a rotational - symmetry geometry exhibit exciting characteristic such as extremely high quality factor , small mode volume , and excellent scalability @xcite . as a result",
    ", this system has been of particular interest to reach the strong light - matter coherent interaction . in experiment ,",
    "single cold caesiums coupled to a silica microtoroid @xcite , nanocrystalline quantum dots coupled to microsphere cavities thomas , park , and single quantum dots coupled microdisks peter , painter have been reported .    except single etched quantum dots embedding in the microdisks , single cold atoms or nanocrystalline quantum dots are locating on the outer surface of cavity .",
    "in this case , only weak evanescent field of the cavity mode is used to interact with atoms / quantum dots , and thus the coherent coupling strength can not reach its maximum . in this paper , we study cavity qed in a silica toroid microcavity coated with a high - refractive - index nanolayer .",
    "the idea is at least twofold .",
    "first , with an increasing in nanolayer thickness , the optical field of a wgm in the coated microtoroid moves to outside the silica surface where quantum dots are located , which results in strongly enhancing the coherent interaction strength between the wgm and coupled quantum dots .",
    "second , the high - refractive - index layer compresses the radial optical field of the wgm , which may reduce the mode volume .",
    "the geometry of the proposed nanolayer - coated microcavity is shown in fig .",
    "1 . a silica microtoroid with a refraction index @xmath1  can be prepared on a silicon chip through the standard photolithography technique and co2 laser reflow @xcite , with the major radius @xmath2 and the minor radius @xmath3 .",
    "the toroidal microcavity is then coated by a layer of polymer material , such as su-8 , which is transparent over visible to infrared su8 , and has a large refraction index @xmath4 .",
    "the coating thickness is a nanometer scaling , denoted by @xmath5 . beyond the coated polymer ,",
    "it is the air with refraction index @xmath6 .",
    "recently , this type of polymer coated microcavities has been utilized for enhancing the sensitivity of a cavity - based biosensor @xcite , suppressing the thermal - optic noise in silica resonator @xcite , and observing electromagnetically induced transparency - like effect in a single cavity @xcite . in this paper , however , we focus on the cavity qed with coated microcavity . in the following study , we vary the major radius @xmath2 and the coating thickness @xmath5 , but fix the size of minor radius @xmath7 for simplicity .    in order to investigate the properties of coated microtoroids for cavity qed , we focus our attention on the dipole transition with a zero - phonon line at @xmath8 of the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) defect in diamond nanocrystal . nv centers are well suited for cavity qed and quantum information because they have a long - lived spin triplet ( over @xmath9 ) in its electronic ground state @xcite  that can be initialized , manipulated , and read out through highly stable optical and microwave excitations at room temperature . experimentally , single nv centers have been studied as a photostable single - photon source without photobleaching for quantum communication @xcite , quantum register , rabi oscillations and conditional two - qubit quantum gates for quantum information and computation @xcite .",
    "single nv center strongly coupling to a cavity mode has also been demonstrated nv6,park , benson .",
    "in essence , the investigation of the coupling between a nv center and a cavity mode field can be specified by three cavity - qed parameters : the quality factors @xmath0 of the cavity mode , the mode volume @xmath10 , and the effective dipole - cavity coupling coefficient @xmath11 at the nv center s location @xmath12 . in whispering gallery cavity qed experiment",
    ", the nv centers typically interact only with the evanescent field of the cavity mode .",
    "thus , we assume that single nv centers are located near the microcavity surface .",
    "different from a spherical microcavity , there is no analytic solution for a microtoroid though the perturbative analytic theory has been proposed min . for a nanolayer coated microtoroid ,",
    "the perturbative analytic theory may still work but it should be much more complicated . therefore , to explicitly achieve the useful metrics of the coated toroidal microcavity , such as resonant wavelengths , quality factors and mode volumes , we resort to numerical simulations . in figs .",
    "2a and 2b , by using a full - vectorial finite element method ( fem ) , we show two typical wgms in a coated silica microtoroid in the wavelength of @xmath8 . here",
    "the major and minor radii of the silica toroid are set as @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 , respectively , and the coating thickness is @xmath16 .",
    "similar to an uncoated microtoroid , the mode field in the coated toroidal microcavity can be treated as quasi - te or quasi - tm modes . for quasi - te modes ,",
    "the dominant electric field components are in the azimuthal vertical direction , as shown by the red arrows in fig . 2a ; while for quasi - tm modes , the dominant electric fields are in the radial direction , as shown in fig .",
    "their normalized squared transverse electric fields are also plotted in figs . 2c and 2d , respectively .",
    "it can be found two important indications . on one hand , for quasi - te modes ,",
    "the electric field shows a relatively smooth boundary change along the radial direction since it dominates in the azimuthal vertical ( transverse ) direction which has continuous nature of dielectric boundary @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , there is some minor discontinuty at the boundary interface , as indicated in the ellipse in fig .",
    "the reason is that the toroidal geometry has been strongly compressed with respect to a microsphere , and strictly speaking , the quasi - te modes are hybrid modes . as a result ,",
    "the nontransverse electric field does exist though they remain relatively small . for quasi - tm modes ,",
    "as expected , a large discontinuty of the electric fields on the boundary occurs .",
    "this is because the dominant electric field component of the quasi - tm mode is in the radial direction ( normal to the boundary interface ) which satisfies the discontinous boundary condition @xmath18 . on the other hand , in the presence of the nanolayer coating , the maximum of the electric field of the wgms further move to the silica - polymer boundary interface compared to that of an uncoated silica toroidal microcavity . for quasi - te modes ,",
    "the maximum can even be located in the polymer layer for a smaller coating thickness .",
    "this qualitatively demonstrates the first motivation of this paper that the effective dipole - cavity coupling rate when the nv center is placed the outer surface of the silica can be increased for a coated microcavity . in the following sections , we in turn discuss the quality factors @xmath0 and the mode volume @xmath19 of the wgms in the coated silica microtoroid , and the effective dipole - cavity coupling rate @xmath20",
    "also , we will only consider the fundamental modes for both the quasi - polarizations , as they possess the smallest mode volumes and thus the largest coupling strengths .",
    "for cavity qed experiment , the quality factor of the wgm is one of important parameters .",
    "it is related to the several different optical loss mechanisms . in general",
    ", the overall quality factor can be calculated by adding the different contributions in the following express@xmath21 and@xmath22 where @xmath23 is due to purely radiative losses for an ideal dielectric microcavity ; @xmath24 results from non - ideal material properties , including the contributions the scattering losses from residual surface inhomogeneities ( @xmath25 ) , absorption losses due to water on the outer surface of the coating polymer ( @xmath26 ) , and bulk absorption in the silica and polymer material ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "typically , the silica toroid has an atom - scale surface due to its laser - reflow fabrication , and this smooth surface will transfer to the polymer , resulting a very small scattering losses from residual surface inhomogeneities ; on the other hand , the water absorption can be suppressed in a vacuum environment .",
    "thus here we consider only radiation - related quality factor @xmath23 , material absorption - related quality factor @xmath27 , and the total quality factor @xmath28 .",
    "since in this paper we focus on the dipole transition of nv defect at center wavelength @xmath8 , we set the absorption losses of silica and su-8 @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .    in order to study how the quality factors depend on the coating thickness @xmath5 , figs .",
    "3a and 3b illustrate @xmath28 , @xmath23 , and @xmath31 for quasi - tm and te modes , respectively . for an uncoated silica toroid ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the total quality factor @xmath33 behaves the radiation loss limited ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) since the absorption of silica is much smaller ( resulting @xmath35 ) for both the tm and te modes .",
    "this is valid if we neglect the surface scattering loss for a small sized microsphere . for the coated silica toroid with a large coating thickness , for example @xmath36 ,",
    "however , @xmath28 is limited by the absorption loss ( thus @xmath37 ) since in this case the absorption of polymer plays the dominant role in the whole loss mechanisms .",
    "this can be partly demonstrated in figs . 3c and 3d . with increasing the coating thickness , more and more energy distributes in the nanolayer .",
    "when the thickness @xmath5 ranges from @xmath38 and @xmath39 , it is a little complicated .",
    "there is a tradeoff between @xmath23 and @xmath40 . in general , with increasing the thickness @xmath5 , the radiation loss rapidly decreases due to the  protection of the high - index nanolayer ( leading to a quick increasing of @xmath23 ) , while the absorption loss increases because more mode energy distributes in the relatively high loss polymer layer ( resulting in a decreasing of @xmath27 ) .",
    "for both the modes , when the coating thickness @xmath5 increases from @xmath38 , the total quality factor @xmath28 first shows a slight increase , because the increasing rate of the absorption loss is less than the decreasing rate of the radiation loss . at a certain thickness @xmath5 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 for quasi - tm and te modes , respectively )",
    ", @xmath28 reaches the maximum when the increasing rate of the absorption loss is right compensated by the decreasing rate of the radiation loss .",
    "then with the coating thickness increases further , @xmath28 decreases because the increasing rate of the absorption loss exceeds the decreasing rate of the radiation loss .",
    "quality factors are also dependent on the the size of toroid .",
    "here we give the coating thickness @xmath43 and the minor radius @xmath44 @xmath45 , and study their dependence on the major radius @xmath2 , as shown in figs . 4a and 4b , for quasi - tm and te modes , respectively .",
    "we have the following results .",
    "first , the absorption related quality @xmath46 only experiences slight increase with the major radius @xmath2 changing .",
    "second , at small major radius , the radiation loss is much higher than the absorption loss , resulting in the radiation - limited total quality factor @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "third , when the major radius @xmath2 increases , the radiation loss decreases and becomes comparable with the absorption loss . in this case ,",
    "@xmath28 increases fast with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "finally , when @xmath2 is large enough , the radiation loss becomes much lower than the absorption loss , resulting in the absorption - limited @xmath28 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the other important parameter for cavity qed is the modal volume @xmath50 of wgm , defined as@xmath51 using eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , the modal volume is numerically calculated in fig . 5 for different coating thickness and major radius .",
    "the mode volume may increase or decrease at different coating thickness .",
    "to better explain this phenomenon , we note that the mode volume also could be approximately expressed as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the effective radius of the ring - type cavity , and @xmath54 represents the effective mode area in the cross section ( see figs .",
    "1a and 1b showing the cross sectional distributions for quasi - te and tm mode fields ) . typically , there are the following three regions .",
    "( i ) when the su-8 polymer coating thickness on the silica microtoroid is small , the mode volume first exhibits an obvious increasing with @xmath5 for both the quasi - te and tm modes .",
    "this is due to the increase of the effective radius @xmath55 , approximately proportional to @xmath56 , while @xmath54 keeps almost unchanged ( minor energy in the coating nanolayer ) .",
    "( ii ) with the coating thickness increasing , it is interesting that @xmath19 starts to decrease .",
    "this can be understood by considering the fact that the refractive index @xmath4 of su-8 polymer is larger than the silica .",
    "the coating polymer film forms a kind of film waveguide , where light could be well confined in the film by the total internal reflection at both the polymer - silica and polymer - silica interfaces .",
    "the guiding modes in film must satisfy the cut - off conditions . as a result ,",
    "when @xmath5 is as large as @xmath57 , the most field energy of the mode could be well confined in the film , resulting in the reduced mode area @xmath54 .",
    "the decreasing rate of @xmath54 exceeds the increasing rate of @xmath55 , so that the mode volume decreases in a range of @xmath5 .",
    "( iii ) finally , with @xmath58 keeping increased , the polymer - silica interface plays a minor role in confining light , so the mode volume increases again with @xmath5 ( the decreasing rate of @xmath54 is less the increasing rate of @xmath55 again ) .",
    "the change of the mode volumes for quasi - te and tm polarized modes are slightly different , originating from the different cut - off condition of guide mode for different polarization .",
    "as we mentioned above , the ultimate goal of this paper is to employ the wgms of coated silica microtoroids as cavity modes for achieving strong coupling to nv centers within the setting of cavity qed .",
    "based on the above basic results , we can analyze the coupling coefficient @xmath59 , which is the coupling frequency of a nv center to a particular cavity mode and corresponds to one - half the single - photon rabi frequency .",
    "since we assume that the nv center in a diamond nanocrystal is located just at the outer surface of the silica toroid and interacts with a wgm , we can define an effective coupling coefficient @xmath60 , given by@xmath61 where the coefficient @xmath62 defining the electric field at the outer silica - polymer interface normalized to the maximum , and @xmath63 with @xmath64 @xmath65 representing the dipole moment of nv center transition . in this section ,",
    "we analyze @xmath66 and @xmath67 depending on the coating thickness , and point out the potential of enhanced interaction between the nv center and the cavity mode in coated microcavity .",
    "figure 6 depicts the coefficient @xmath66 when the major radius @xmath2 is @xmath68 , @xmath13 , and @xmath42 @xmath45 , and the coating thickness @xmath5 ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath69 nm . for the quasi - te mode , @xmath66 first increases and then decreases smoothly .",
    "the underlying physics is that the maximal electric field s position of the quasi - te mode is drawn to the outside from inside of the silica toroid when the coating thickness is increasing . at a critical thickness(for instance , about @xmath70 nm for @xmath71 @xmath72this critical thickness slightly decreases for a smaller major radius ) , @xmath66 approaches @xmath14 . in other words ,",
    "the maximal electric field of the quasi - te mode in this case locates at the silica - polymer interface . for the quasi - tm mode",
    ", it is a somewhat complicated .",
    "the coefficient @xmath66 suddenly decreases in the present of the nanometer - sized polymer coating layer , because of the discontinous boundary condition for quasi - tm modes .",
    "then @xmath66 gradually increases and decreases similar to he quasi - te mode , with increasing the coating thickness . unlike the quasi - te mode case ,",
    "the maximal @xmath66 is about @xmath73 , smaller than both @xmath74 and @xmath14 .",
    "the former is due to the presence of the non - radial electric field ; while the latter is because of the discontinous condition at silica - polymer boundary for the quasi - tm mode .",
    "moreover , the electric field approaches the maximum within a very large range of the thickness @xmath5 because the maximal electric field is exactly on the inner surface of the silica in this range .",
    "by now , we have obtained the mode volume @xmath19 and the coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we calculate the effective coupling coefficient @xmath75 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , as shown in fig . 7 for both the quasi - te and tm modes . since the coating nanolayer moves the maximum of the mode field to the silica - polymer interface , the effective coupling coefficient @xmath60 is greatly enhanced . for example",
    ", @xmath76 is of the order of , and exceeds twice of the uncoated case for the quasi - te mode .",
    "thus , an enhanced interaction can be achieved between the wgm in the polymer - coated silica microtoroid and the coupled nv center .",
    "we now turn to compare the effective coupling coefficient @xmath60 , the cavity mode decay rate @xmath77 , and the transverse spontaneous emission rate @xmath78 for the dipole transition of nv center . for an intuitive comparison , we give an example showing quantitative values of them . for an polymer coated silica toroid with the parameters @xmath71 @xmath45 , @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and the coating thickness @xmath82 , the effective coupling coefficient @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 , the cavity decay rate @xmath86 @xmath87 for a quasi - te mode .",
    "therefore , we can easily know that the coated silica toroid provides a good platform to achieve strong coupling regime because of @xmath88 .",
    "in the section above , we have theoretically demonstrated the enhanced nv center - wgm interaction for an coated silica microcavity .",
    "one may argue that the coating layer may also reduce the total quality factor @xmath89  of the cavity mode ( as shown in fig .",
    "3 ) , as well as an actually degraded @xmath90 though @xmath60 can be improved . thus more discussions on the coated microcavity are necessary .",
    "first , as pointed out in the section iii , the total quality factor @xmath28 is limited by the su-8 polymer absorption loss when the coating layer exceeds a certain thickness . as a result",
    ", @xmath28 has already reduced before the coupling system reaches the maximal coherent interaction ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) . to exploit the enhanced - interaction advantages of the coated microcavity ,",
    "su-8 polymer coating is particularly suitable for a smaller silica toroid .",
    "for example , when the major radius @xmath92 @xmath45 , @xmath93 is still limited by the radiation losses even in the presence of the coating layer ( @xmath43 @xmath94 ) . in this case , @xmath60 is strongly enhanced while @xmath95 keeps unchanged .",
    "second , the reduction of @xmath95 can be relaxed by choosing a lower loss polymer , such as pmma , leading to an almost unaffected @xmath47 ( high up to @xmath96 ) in a pmma - coated silica microsphere @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the refraction index of pmma @xmath97 is about @xmath98 , which is closed to that of silica .",
    "thus , not only the coefficient @xmath99 of the quasi - te mode is increasing , but also @xmath100 can be further improved to @xmath101 .",
    "third , in an actual wgm cavity qed experiment , the deposition of quantum dots or diamond nanocrystals on the silica surface will inevitably degrade the total quality factor due to additional scattering losses , particularly for the case when silica cavity is immersed in a solution and then withdrawn @xcite .",
    "the existence of the polymer coating nanolayer , however , could recover the high total quality factor because the polymer nanolayer has a much more smooth surface which strongly reduce the scattering losses .",
    "finally , compared to the conventional case that single atoms or nanocrystals are just adsorbed on the silica surface , the polymer nanolayer provides a protection , and single nanocrystals can stably locate on the silica surface .",
    "it is also noted that the spontaneous emission rate given above is the value in the vacuum . when nv centers are placed in a dielectric",
    ", this rate will be changed , and can be approximately calculated as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are dielectric constants for surrounding medium and diamond @xcite , respectively . in the present paper , it is much more complex since the surrounding medium includes both silica and su-8 polymer .",
    "nevertheless , the difference is estimated about @xmath105 if we take the average value for silica and su-8 polymer .",
    "this change may partly reduce the cavity qed parameter @xmath106 .",
    "the experimental realization of the polymer coating on the silica surface is the essential requirement in this study .",
    "fortunately , polymer generally has a low surface tension enabling it to wet many materials including silica .",
    "polymer - coated silica microcavities have been experimentally demonstrated recently @xcite , and atomic force microscope scans reveal that the rms roughness of the polymer surface is comparable to that of bare silica .",
    "this makes our design has a highly experimental feasibility .",
    "we have theoretically studied both the quasi - te and tm fundamental whispering gallery modes in polymer coated silica microtoroids .",
    "both the modes show very high quality factors and small mode volumes .",
    "it is of importance that the coated silica microcavity strongly enhances the coherent interaction strength at least twice between the wgm and the coupled nv center , compared to the uncoated microcavity , because ( 1 ) the coating layer ( though nanometer sized ) can draw the maximal electric field of the mode to the outside of the silica toroid where nv centers are located ; ( 2 ) the mode volume can be reduced due to the high refraction index polymer layer . furthermore , the coating nanolayer makes the cavity qed system more robust .",
    "thus , the polymer coated microtoroid is highly feasible in experiment and offers a good platform to study strong - coupling cavity qed , quantum information and quantum computation .",
