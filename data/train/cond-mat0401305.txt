    "the theoretical investigation of the interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations has a long history .",
    "the concept of a polaron , which describes an electron which carries with it a lattice deformation , was introduce first by landau in 1933  @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful theories of the last century , the bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity  @xcite is based on the observation that phonons induce an effective attraction between electrons .",
    "the discovery of high @xmath1 superconductors renewed the interest in the study of the electron - phonon interaction , and the bipolaron problem in particular . in the cuprate materials",
    "the strength of the interaction between electrons and phonons is believed to be in the intermediate regime .",
    "because of this rather strong interaction the lattice ions change their equilibrium position when they are in the vicinity of charge carries , i.e the charge carries drive a phonon vacuum instability  @xcite .",
    "the classical migdal - eliashberg approach to the theory of superconductivity  @xcite , which neglects these effects and is valid only for small electron - phonon coupling , can not be applied to cuprates . therefore special theoretical attention was given to scenarios where electrons ( or holes ) form pairs in real space ( bipolarons ) , which suffer bose - einstein condensation , leading to superconductivity  @xcite . in this respect alexandrov and",

    "its solution is important for understanding the competition between the phonon - induced electron - electron attraction and the electron - electron coulomb repulsion . as our calculation ,",
    "based on a quantum monte carlo algorithm , shows , in the intermediate and strong electron - phonon coupling regions , phonons strongly renormalize the effective hopping integral of the electrons , strongly reduce the effective on - site coulomb repulsion but do not significantly affect the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction .",
    "this gives rise to low - energy effective hamiltonians with a large antiferromagnetic interaction relative to the the effective hopping and the effective repulsion terms , which could nt be derived starting from pure electronic models .",
    "we find that , depending on the value of the coulomb repulsion , two electrons can form an on - site strongly bound state for small @xmath0 or a weakly bound nearest - neighbor localized state for larger @xmath0 .",
    "the former state appears when the effective on - site attraction due to phonons overcome the coulomb repulsion and the later is a result of the exchange interaction which wins over the strongly renormalized electron ( polaron ) kinetic energy .",
    "we developed a diagrammatic quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) algorithm suitable for studying the two - dimensional hh bipolaron .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first two - dimensional calculation which considers dynamical phonons and does not entail any artificial truncation of the hilbert space .",

    "we can look for all the symmetries given by the representations of the @xmath201 point group .",

    "we have to generate diagrams where the time @xmath115 is obtained after a translation and a point group operation applied to the time @xmath60 .",
    "in other words the electronic configurations of the diagrams ends should be connected by a space group operation . for every operation",
    "there is a certain factor @xmath202 which separates the different representations , and the value of an observable is calculated analogues to eq .",

    "<S> we present a diagrammatic monte carlo study of the properties of the hubbard - holstein bipolaron on a two - dimensional square lattice . with a small coulomb repulsion , @xmath0 , and with increasing electron - phonon interaction , and when reaching a value about two times smaller than the one corresponding to the transition of light polaron to heavy polaron , </S>",
    "<S> the system suffers a sharp transition from a state formed by two weakly bound light polarons to a heavy , strongly bound on - site bipolaron . aside from this rather conventional bipolaron a new bipolaron state </S>",
    "<S> is found for large u at intermediate and large electron - phonon coupling , corresponding to two polarons bound on nearest - neighbor sites . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss both the properties of the different bipolaron states and the transition from one state to another . </S>",
    "<S> we present a phase diagram in parameter space defined by the electron - phonon coupling and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical method does not use any artificial approximation and can be easily modified to other bipolaron models with longer range electron - phonon and/or electron - electron interaction . </S>"
