    "the study of asymmetric superconductivity , i.e. , of superconductivity in systems where different types of quasi - particles coexist at a common fermi surface has raised a lot of interest in the last years .",
    "this in part is due to the relevance of this problem for many different areas in physics .",
    "it arises in cold atomic systems with superfluid phases @xcite , in color superconductivity in the core of neutron stars @xcite and in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore it is closely related to inhomogeneous superconductivity , as fflo phases @xcite , since this is a possible ground state for asymmetric systems . in condensed matter , as inter - metallic materials , due to electrons from different orbitals at the fermi surface , there is a natural mismatch of their fermi wave - vectors .",
    "this arises because of the different effective masses of these quasi - particles or because they occur in distinct numbers per atom .",
    "then , in multi - band systems , even in the absence of external magnetic fields , one has to consider the possibility of inhomogeneous superconductivity or other types of exotic ground states as gapless superconducting phases @xcite or phase separation @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the problem of driving a multi - band superconductor to the normal state by applying external pressure .",
    "when this occurs continuously , this transition is associated with a sqcp .",
    "the theories which have been proposed for the sqcp rely in general on the presence of disorder or magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "however , there is no reason to expect that this should play a role in clean systems driven to a normal state by external pressure . in the model",
    "we discuss here , mixing transfers electrons that participate in cooper pairing to a normal band eventually destroying superconductivity .",
    "since there is no dissipation in the normal band , superconductivity disappears due to a loss of coherence in the system .",
    "our model considers two hybridized bands in the presence of inter and intra - band attractive interactions .",
    "these interactions are competing and determine the nature of the zero temperature phase transitions to the normal state as hybridization ( pressure ) increases .",
    "we show that only when intra - band interactions are dominant this transition is continuous . otherwise it is first order and accompanied by phase separation as usual in this case .",
    "the problem of superconductivity in systems with overlapping bands has been treated originally by suhl , matthias and walker @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the different interactions @xcite has been discussed in terms of an energy associated with the fermi surface mismatch , @xmath2 and the critical temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "only when the former is much smaller then the latter inter - band interactions become important . in our approach",
    "the mismatch @xmath4 depends on hybridization and can be controlled by pressure .",
    "we consider a model with two types of quasi - particles , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with an attractive inter - band interaction @xcite @xmath7 , an attractive intra - band interaction @xmath8 and a hybridization term @xmath9 that mixes different quasi - particles states @xcite .",
    "this one - body mixing term @xmath0 is related to the overlap of the wave functions and can be tuned by external parameters , like pressure , allowing to explore the phase diagram and quantum phase transitions of the model .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are creation operators for the light @xmath5 and the heavy @xmath6 quasi - particles , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath13 .",
    "the dispersion relations @xmath14 and the ratio between effective masses is taken as @xmath15 . for simplicity ,",
    "we renormalize all the energies in the problem by the chemical potential @xmath16 of the band @xmath5 ( the _ non - tilde _ quantities ) .",
    "furthermore we take @xmath17 . in this case , the dispersion relations can be written as , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath0-term is responsible for the transmutation among the quasi - particles . in metallic systems , as transition metals@xcite , intermetallic compounds and heavy fermions@xcite , it is due to the mixing of the wave - functions of the quasi - particles in different orbitals through the crystalline potential . in the quark problem , it is the weak interaction that allows the transformation between up and down - quarks@xcite . for a system of cold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice with two atomic states ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the @xmath0-term is due to raman transitions with an effective rabi frequency which is directly proportional to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "then , the physical origin of the @xmath0-term is different for each case .",
    "the main point is that at least in inter - metallic systems , hybridization can be easily controlled by pressure or doping@xcite allowing to explore their phase diagram using these quantities as external parameters .",
    "notice that since hybridization transforms a quasi - particle into one another , in its presence only the total number of particles is conserved",
    ".    the order parameters that characterize the different superconducting phases of the system described by the above hamiltonian are , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these are related to inter - band and intra - band superconductivity , respectively .",
    "the anomalous correlation functions can be obtained from the greens functions which also yield the spectrum of excitations in the superconducting phases .",
    "we use the equation of motion method to calculate standard and anomalous greens functions @xcite .",
    "excitonic types of correlations that just renormalize the hybridization @xcite are neglected .",
    "the relevant anomalous greens functions are , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . when we write the equations of motion for them , new greens functions",
    "are generated @xcite .",
    "some of these are of higher order , as they contain a larger number of creation and annihilation operators than just the two of the initials greens functions . for these",
    ", we apply a bcs type of decoupling @xcite to reduce them to the order of the originals propagators . finally , writing the equations of motion for the new greens functions , we obtain a closed system of equations that can be solved @xcite .",
    "the anomalous propagators from which the order parameters are self - consistently obtained are given by @xcite ,  @xmath25 with@xmath26 and@xmath27   } { \\omega^{4}+c_{2}\\omega^{2}+c_{1}\\omega+c_{0 } } \\label{eq03}\\ ] ] where@xmath28 \\label{eq04}\\\\ c_{1 }   &   = 4\\delta_{ab}\\delta\\nonumber\\\\ c_{0 }   &   = \\left [   \\epsilon_{k}^{a}\\epsilon_{k}^{b}-\\left (   v^{2}-\\delta _ { ab}^{2}\\right )   \\right ]   ^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\epsilon_{k}^{a2}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as mentioned before , the poles of these propagators give the excitations of the system . also from the discontinuity of the greens functions on the real axis",
    "we can obtain the anomalous correlation functions characterizing the superconducting state .",
    "in general the appearance of exotic superconducting phases is related to the existence of soft modes in the spectrum of excitations @xcite . in the present case , for the energy of the excitations to vanish , it is required that @xmath29   ^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\epsilon_{k}^{a2}=0 $ ] .",
    "this can occur by tuning the hybridization parameter , such that , @xmath30 in which case gapless excitations appear at @xmath31 where @xmath32 . without this fine tuning",
    "there are no gapless modes .",
    "however , in case the intra - band interaction vanishes there is a zero energy mode for the wave - vector @xmath33 , such that , @xmath34 . we will see the effects of this behavior in the next section .",

    "the right hand sides of eqs.[eq07 ] and [ eq10 ] define the gap functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in the next section",
    "we discuss the behavior of the dispersion relations , of the gap functions and obtain the free energy of the system . from these quantities",
    "we obtain the phase diagrams for finite and zero temperatures .",
    "for completeness we discuss briefly the behavior of the system at zero temperature@xcite . for purely inter - band interactions the transitions are discontinuous and",
    "there is no sqcp in the system ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . from the ground state energy",
    "we can identify three characteristic values of the hybridization .",
    "starting from the superconducting ground state , as hybridization increases at a value @xmath55 appears a minimum in the ground state energy at the origin @xmath56 that coexists with an absolute minimum at finite @xmath57 associated with the superconducting state . further increasing @xmath0",
    "there is a first order phase transition to the normal state at @xmath58 , for which the energies of the normal and superconducting states are degenerate . for still larger @xmath0 ,",
    "the superconducting state remains as a metastable state until @xmath59 where it stops being a minimum of the energy .",
    "the values @xmath55 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for a fixed set of parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath50 , @xmath60 ) yield zero temperature phase diagrams shown in ref .",
    "it is interesting to point out that in the inter - band case sufficiently large values of @xmath0 can give rise to soft modes in the dispersion relations which are associated with the presence of fermi surfaces in the superconducting state@xcite .    for purely intra - bands",
    "interactions@xcite , as in the general case , the dispersion relations of the excitations in the superconductor do not vanish for any @xmath33 or @xmath0 , since the equation @xmath61",
    "^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\epsilon_{k}^{a2}=0 $ ] does not present any non - trivial solution . for @xmath62 ,",
    "differently from the inter - band case , as @xmath0 increases the value of @xmath63 the minimum of the ground state energy vanishes continuously as the system enters in the normal phase @xcite .",
    "there are no metastable states in this case .",
    "we also observe from the gap equation that a minimum value of the interaction @xmath64 is required to sustain superconductivity . at this value of the interaction",
    "there is a continuous second order phase transition and this mixing dependent critical interaction @xmath65 ( or interaction dependent critical hybridization ) characterizes a superconducting quantum critical point . in practice",
    "this sqcp can be reached applying pressure to the system which is a common procedure , for example , in the study of hf materials @xcite .      in this section",
    "we consider both intra and inter - band interactions and discuss the phase diagrams in the presence of controlled mixing and finite temperatures . for simplicity , and to show clearly the effect of each term we assume strong inter or intra - band terms and in each case the other interaction",
    "is added perturbatively or neglected .",
    "for dominant inter - bands interactions , such that , @xmath67 , we see in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] that the phase transitions that were initially discontinuous , of first order , become continuous as temperature increases .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the inter - band gap function as a function of the order parameter @xmath57 and temperature .",
    "notice that close to where the transition changes from first to second order , there is a reentrant behavior which can also be seen in figure [ fig3 ] . in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we took @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "similar values for the parameters were used in the other figures .",
    "we now treat the case of dominant intra - band interactions , the inter - band term being considered perturbatively ( @xmath72 ) with minor effects . in practice for inter - metallic compounds",
    "this is the case of greater interest .",
    "therefore , we will analyze how the usual intra - band superconductivity changes under the influence of temperature and pressure ( hybridization ) .",
    "we obtain the variation of the electronic term of the specific heat in the normal phase as hybridization changes and the system goes through the sqcp .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the phase diagram where the critical temperature is plotted as a function of hybridization .",
    "the critical line is a line of second order phase transitions . for these values of parameters",
    "we observe that hybridization initially increases the critical temperature before destroying superconductivity .",
    "since the transitions are continuous there is a sqcp at a critical value of the hybridization @xmath1 . for values of @xmath0 close to @xmath1 ,",
    "the critical line vanishes at the sqcp as @xmath73 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .        the free energy of the system can be obtained in terms of the elementary excitations .",

    "notice that instead of obtaining the gap functions from the greens functions they can be found by minimization of the free energy with respect to the order parameters .",

    "we notice that the maximum @xmath105 occurs in a region of the phase diagram where @xmath106 is increasing with @xmath0 . at the critical value of the hybridization the coefficient of the linear term is passing through a broad maximum .",
    "the values of @xmath106 can be measured all along in the normal phase , above @xmath105 , as hybridization is increasing with external pressure and passes through the superconducting quantum critical point at @xmath1 .",
    "a behavior of @xmath106 as a function of pressure as that shown in figure [ fig5 ] would be a strong indication that the present mechanism is responsible for destroying superconductivity . since @xmath106 is proportional to the total density of states at the fermi level figure [ fig5 ]",
    "is helpful to understand the initial increase of @xmath105 with hybridization as shown in figure [ fig3 ] . in the bcs approximation used here this",
    "is related to the density of states at the fermi level and this , as shown by the behavior of @xmath106 , increases initially as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the results of this paper are obtained using a mean field approximation which does not include fluctuations .",
    "the mean - field character of the theory is reflected , for example , in the shape of the critical line that vanishes as @xmath107 close to the sqcp as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the specific heat calculated above was obtained in the normal phase and is due solely to the contributions of unpaired quasi - particles in the hybridized bands .",
    "there are no effects of fluctuations since they are not taken into account .",
    "due to the nature of the approximations we used , we can expect that the superconducting temperatures reflects the variations in the density of states and consequently in @xmath106 as hybridization is changed . as pointed out before the increase in @xmath105 for small @xmath0 is entirely consistent with the behavior of @xmath106 shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "what is remarkable however is that superconductivity is destroyed while still both bands contribute to the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath108 , such that , hybridization increases the mismatch @xmath109 between the fermi wave - vectors of the hybrid bands .",
    "as it is well known@xcite this can give rise to superconducting instabilities which however always occur discontinuously through first order transitions .",
    "in the present case the @xmath62 superconductor - normal transition is continuous being associated with a sqcp . since there is no dissipation in the electronic bands but a lack of coherence in one of them we may attribute to this the destruction of the superconducting phase .",
    "it is clear that in inter - metallic systems hybridization occurs even at zero pressure .",
    "the point we wish to emphasize is that this depends on applied pressure and for this reason it can be used as a control parameter .",
    "a final remark is that as a matter of fact the control parameter is @xmath110 which is the ratio of hybridization over the bandwidth of the light quasi - particles .",
    "the latter also depends on pressure and although we have naturally assumed that the ratio _ increases _ with pressure , this is not immediate and may depend on the particular system .",
    "we have investigated a mechanism to drive a multi - band superconductor to a superconducting quantum critical point through the application of pressure or doping@xcite . it does not rely on the presence of magnetic impurities or disorder , but on the sensitivity of hybridization to these external parameters .",
    "evidence that the mechanism we are proposing is in action can be obtained from measuring the coefficient of the linear term of the electronic specific heat just above the superconducting transition as a function of pressure .",
    "this shows features which can be correlated with the behavior of @xmath105 .",
    "superconductivity is destroyed when all hybrid bands still contribute to the density of states and the zero temperature transition is from the superconductor to a metallic state .",
