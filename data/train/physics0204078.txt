    "the lorentz angle @xmath0 , by which charge carriers are deflected in a magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field , is defined by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 corresponds to the drift distance along the electric field and @xmath3 to the shift of the signal position ( see fig .",
    "if the ionization is produced at the surface , the drift distance equals the detector thickness .",
    "if the ionization is produced homogeneously by a traversing particle , the averaged drift distance is only half the detector thickness .",
    "the drift mobility in a magnetic field , called the hall mobility , is denoted by @xmath4 , the drift mobility without magnetic field by @xmath5 .",
    "they are related by the hall scattering factor @xmath6 .",
    "this factor describes the mean free time between carrier collisions , which depends on the carrier energy @xcite .",
    "the hall scattering factor has a value of @xmath70.7 for holes and @xmath81.15 for electrons at room temperature @xcite .",
    "an important question is the dependence of the lorentz shift on the irradiation dose .",
    "radiation damage can change the drift properties , which will change the lorentz shift .",
    "such a shift appears as a misalignment of the detector as function of radiation dose , which itself is a function of the distance from the interaction point .     _",

    "a comprehensive study of lorentz shifts of non - irradiated and irradiated sensors was performed at karlsruhe @xcite .",
    "the lorentz angle has been measured for electrons and holes separately . a temperature range of 77k-300k",
    "was covered .",
    "the lorentz angle is measured by injecting charges at the surface on one side and observing the drift through the sensor by measuring the position of the charge on the opposite side ( see fig .",
    "alternative methods are described in @xcite .",
    "charges are generated by injecting laser light with a wavelength of @xmath10@xmath11650 nm , which has an absorption length of @xmath113@xmath9 m at 300k . in this case",
    "charge carriers of one type are collected at the nearest electrode , whereas the carriers of the other type drift towards the opposite side .",
    "this allows the measurement of the lorentz angle for electrons and holes separately by injecting laser light either on the p- or n - side .",
    "the laser from fermions lasertech @xcite has a maximum power of 1mw , which could be adjusted by the pulse height and width of the input pulse to the laserdiode .",
    "typically a laser pulse with a width around 1ns was generated.the laser pulse was sent to the sensor via a single - mode fibre with an inner diameter of a few microns .",
    "so the beam spot on the detector could be varied from a few micron onwards by changing the distance between fibre and sensor .    for the measurements",
    "the jumbo magnet from the forschungszentrum karlsruhe @xcite has been used in a @xmath12@xmath1310 t configuration with a warm bore of 72 mm .",
    "the sensors are double sided microstrip detectors of approximately 2x1 cm from the hera - b production by sintef @xcite .",
    "they have a strip pitch of 50@xmath9 m on the p  side and 80@xmath9 m on the n  side ; the strips on opposite sides are oriented at an angle of 90@xmath14 with respect to each other .",
    "the capacitively coupled read out strips are connected through a 1m@xmath15 resistor to the bias ring .",
    "the read out chip for the strip detectors is the premux128-chip with a shaping time of 45ns @xcite .",
    "the chip s common mode is suppressed by a double correlated sampling technique , which substracts the signal s baseline .",
    "the threshold could be adjusted but the signal to noise ratio from the laser pulse , corresponding to a few times the signal from a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) , was sufficiently high , so that the thresholds were not critical .",
    "the averaged signal position @xmath16 is computed from either a fit with the sum of two gaussians or from the center of gravity of the pulse heights @xmath17 on neighbouring strips @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 . both methods gave comparable results .",
