    "is that the @xmath253 expression vanishes when working with a wide band , @xmath254 , and assuming coupling to just one majorana @xmath255 , @xmath256 , i.e. , @xmath257 = ( \\gamma^l)_{kk } g^k(t=0)_{kk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath258\\big\\rangle = 0 $ ] .",
    "thus , in the wide - band limit with coupling to just one majorana @xmath255 , one obtains the expression @xmath259 valid both in non - interacting and interacting setups .",
    "the very cumbersome feature brought by the majoranas is that even in the interacting case the current expression remains completely independent from the occupation state of the system and depends only on spectral properties .",

    "that only when the sign of @xmath45 corresponds to the parity of physical fermions in the system , the resulting structure is a true supersymmetry between bosons and fermions . in general , the symmetry of the hamiltonian is not in any way related to actual fermions or bosons present in the system .                  alternatively , one could work with the nambu - dyson equation  , which contains the different dynamics through the anomalous green s functions of type @xmath276 , @xmath277 .",
    "we have checked that this does not qualitatively alter the results and thus we proceed with the simpler approach , i.e. , the decoupling given in the main text .",
    "the conductance can also be expressed as a function of @xmath278 centered around the second resonance at @xmath190 through the symmetry @xmath279 and @xmath280 which can be used for the analysis of the expression close to @xmath190 ."
