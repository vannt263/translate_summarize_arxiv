    "the electron and hole wave functions acquire an extra phase when moving in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic flux . the acquired extra phase will be different for electrons and holes , and this phase difference can be observed through photoluminescence ( pl ) experiments , which exhibits an optial aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .",
    "experimental verification of this effect has been reported in pl measurements of radially polarized neutral excitons in a type - ii quantum dot structure  @xcite . however , the optical ab effects will be strongly suppressed  @xcite when both the electron and the hole are spatially confined within the same region due to the coulomb interaction , i.e. in a quantum ring ( type - i quantum dot ) .",
    "this has spurred a considerable search and study of the optical ab effect of neutral excitons in semiconductor quantum rings by both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite groups .",
    "the optical ab effect in a quantum ring can be enhanced when the exciton is radially polarized , either by the application of an external electric field  @xcite or due to a radial asymmetry in the effective confinement for electrons and holes  @xcite .",

    "we will show that the ab effect is strongly affected by the shape of the nano - ring structure and the external electric field which has a large effect on the coulomb interaction between the electron and the hole , especially for quantum rings with a large height .",

    "<S> by applying an electric field perpendicular to a semiconductor quantum ring we show that it is possible to modify the single particle wave function between quantum dot ( qd)-like to ring - like . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints on the geometrical parameters of the quantum ring to realize such a transition are derived . </S>",
    "<S> with such a perpendicular electric field we are able to tune the aharanov - bohm ( ab ) effect for both single particles and for excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the tunability is in both the strength of the ab - effect as well as in its periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the strain induce potential inside the self assembled quantum ring and the effect of the strain on the ab effect . </S>"
