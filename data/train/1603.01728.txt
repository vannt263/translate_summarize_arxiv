    "many accretion - powered x - ray sources display rapid variability , coupled with a time - averaged spectrum consisting of a power law terminating in an exponential cutoff at high energies .",
    "the ubiquitous nature of the observations suggests a common mechanism for the spectral formation process , regardless of the type of central object ( e.g. black hole , neutron star , agn , etc . ) . over the past few decades",
    ", the interpretation of the spectral data using steady - state models has demonstrated that the power - law component is most likely due to the thermal comptonization of soft seed photons in a hot ( @xmath0k ) coronal cloud ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) .",
    "while the spectral models yield estimates for the coronal temperature and optical depth , they do not provide much detailed information about the geometry and morphology of the plasma . on the other hand , observations of variability , characterized by time lags and power spectral densities ( psds ) ,",
    "can supplement the spectral analysis , yielding crucial additional information about the structure of the inner region in the accretion flow , where the most rapid variability is generated .",
    "in particular , the study of x - ray time lags , in which the hard photons associated with a given fourier component arrive at the detector before or after the soft photons , provides a unique glimpse into the nature of the high - frequency variability in the inner region .",
    "fourier time lags offer an ideal tool for studying rapid variability because , unlike short - timescale spectral snapshots , which become noisy due to the shortage of photons in small time bins , the fourier technique utilizes all of the data in the entire observational time window , which could extend over hundreds or thousands of seconds .",
    "hence the resulting time lag information usually has much higher significance than can be achieved using conventional spectral analysis .",
    "the fourier method for computing time lags from observational data streams in two energy channels was pioneered by van der klis et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , who proposed a novel mathematical technique for extracting time lags by creating a suitable combination of the hard and soft fourier transforms for a given value of the circular fourier frequency , @xmath1 .",
    "the method utilizes the complex cross - spectrum , denoted by @xmath2 , defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the fourier transforms of the soft and hard channel time series , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath8 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the fourier transforms are calculated using @xmath9 and likewise for the hard channel , @xmath10 the phase lag between the two data streams is computed by taking the argument of @xmath2 , which is the argument angle in the complex plane , and the associated time lag , @xmath11 , is obtained by dividing the phase lag by the fourier frequency . hence we have the relations @xmath12 where the fourier frequency , @xmath13 , is related to the circular frequency @xmath1 via @xmath14 as a simple demonstration of the time lag concept , it is instructive to consider the case where the hard and soft channels , @xmath7 and @xmath6 , are shifted in time by a precise interval @xmath15 , so that the two signals are related to each via @xmath16 where @xmath17 would indicate a hard time lag .",
    "next we take the fourier transform of the hard channel time series to obtain @xmath18 introducing a new time variable , @xmath19 with @xmath20 , allows us to transform the integral in equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) to obtain @xmath21 it follows from equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) that the resulting complex cross - spectrum is given by @xmath22 and hence the resulting time lag is ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) ) @xmath23 this simple calculation confirms that the time lag computed using the fourier method gives the correct answer when a perfect delay is introduced between the two channels , as expected .",
    "it is also important to note that time lags are only produced during a transient .",
    "we can see this by setting the hard and soft signals equal to the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this case , the resulting fourier transforms @xmath5 and @xmath4 have the same phase , and consequently there is no phase lag or time lag .",
    "hence observations of time lags necessarily imply the presence of variability in the observed signal .",
    "the fundamental physical mechanism underlying the x - ray time lag phenomenon has been debated for decades , but it is generally accepted that the time lags reflect the time - dependent scattering of a population of seed photons that are impulsively injected into an extended corona of hot electrons ( e.g. , van der klis et al .",
    "1987 ; miyamoto et al . 1988 ) .",
    "this initial population of photons gain energy as they comptonize in the cloud , and the hard time lags are a natural consequence of the extra time that the hard photons spend in the cloud gaining energy via electron scattering before escaping . in contrast with the time lags ,",
    "the time - averaged ( quiescent ) spectra are thought to be created as a result of the compton scattering of _ continually _ injected seed photons .",
    "the time - dependent upscattering of soft input photons is discussed in detail by payne ( 1980 ) and sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) , who present fundamental formulas for the resulting x - ray spectrum . since that time",
    ", many detailed models have been proposed , most of which focus on a single aspect of radiative transfer , usually by making assumptions about the physical conditions in the disk / corona system regarding the electron temperature , the input photon spectrum , and the size and optical depth of the scattering corona .    the fourier time lags observed from accreting black - hole sources generally decrease with increasing fourier frequency , @xmath13 . in the case of cyg",
    "x-1 , for example , the time lags decrease from @xmath28  sec as @xmath13 increases from @xmath29hz - @xmath30hz .",
    "early attempts to interpret this data using simple compton scattering models resulted in very large , hot scattering clouds , which required very efficient heating at large distances ( @xmath31 ) from the central mass ( poutanen & fabian 1999 , hua et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter hkc ) .",
    "furthermore , the observed dependence of the time lags on the fourier frequency was difficult to explain using a homogeneous compton scattering model .",
    "for example , van der klis et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) found that a homogeneous corona combined with monochromatic soft photon injection resulted in time lags that are _ independent _ of the fourier frequency , @xmath13 , in contradiction to the observations .",
    "this led miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) to conclude , somewhat prematurely , that thermal comptonization could not be producing the lags",
    ". however , in the next decade , hkc and nowak et al . ( 1999 ) developed more robust compton simulations that successfully reproduced the observed time lags , although the large coronal radii @xmath32 continued to raise concerns regarding energy conservation and heating .",
    "hkc computed the time lags and the time - averaged spectra for a variety of electron number density profiles , based on the injection of low - temperature blackbody seed photons at the center of the coronal cloud .",
    "they employed a two - region structure , comprising a central homogeneous zone , connected to a homogeneous or inhomogeneous outer region that extends out to several light - seconds from the central mass . in the inhomogeneous case , the electron number density , @xmath33 , in the outer region varied as @xmath34 or @xmath35 . in the hkc model , the injection spectrum and the injection location were both held constant , and a zero - flux boundary condition was adopted at the center of the cloud .",
    "hkc found that only the model with @xmath34 in the outer region was able to successfully reproduce the observed dependence of the time lags on the fourier frequency . on the other hand , in the homogeneous case , hkc confirmed the miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) result that the time lags are independent of the fourier frequency , in contradiction to the observational data .",
    "this result was also verified later by kroon & becker ( 2014 , hereafter kb ) for the case of monochromatic photon injection into a homogenous corona .      despite the progress made by hkc and other authors ,",
    "no successful first - principles theoretical model for the production of the observed x - ray time lags has yet emerged . in the absence of such a model ,",
    "one is completely dependent on monte carlo simulations , which are somewhat inconvenient since the resulting time lags are not analytically connected with the parameters describing the scattering cloud .",
    "monte carlo simulations are also noisy at high fourier frequency , which is the main region of interest in many applications , although this can be dealt with by adding more test particles . compared with an analytical calculation",
    ", the utilization of monte carlo simulations makes it more challenging to explore different injection scenarios , such as the variation of the injection location and the seed photon spectrum .",
    "the situation changed recently with the work of kb , who presented a detailed analytical solution to the problem of time - dependent thermal comptonization in spherical , homogeneous scattering clouds . by obtaining the fundamental _ photon green s function _ solution to the problem",
    ", they were able to explore a wide variety of injection scenarios , leading to a better understanding of the relationship between the observed time lags and the underlying physical parameters .",
    "kb verified the miyamoto result , namely that monochromatic injection in a homogeneous cloud produces time lags that are independent of fourier period .",
    "the magnitude of this ( constant ) lag depends primarily on the radius of the cloud , @xmath36 , its optical thickness , @xmath37 , and the electron temperature , @xmath38 . following hkc , they employed a zero - net flux boundary condition at the center of the corona ( essentially a mirror condition ) , so that injection could occur at any radius inside the cloud .",
    "the photon transport at the outer edge of the cloud was treated using a free - streaming boundary condition in order to properly account for photon escape .",
    "kb demonstrated that the injection radius and the shape of the injected photon spectrum play a crucial role in determining the dependence of the resulting time lags on the fourier frequency .",
    "in particular , they established for the first time that the reprocessing of a broadband injection spectrum ( e.g. , thermal bremsstrahlung ) can successfully reproduce most of the time lag data for cyg  x-1 and other sources .    in the study presented here ,",
    "we expand on the work of kb to obtain the radiation green s function for _ inhomogeneous _ scattering clouds .",
    "we also present a more detailed derivation of the _ homogeneous _ green s function discussed by kb .",
    "the analytical solutions for the fourier transform of the time - dependent green s function in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases are then used to treat localized bremsstrahlung injection via integral convolution , as an alternative to the essentially monochromatic injection scenario studied by hkc .",
    "in addition to modeling the transient time lags as a result of _ impulsive _ soft photon injection , we also compute the time - independent x - ray spectrum radiated form the surface of the cloud as a result of _ continual _ soft photon injection .",
    "we show that acceptable fits to both the time - lag data and the x - ray spectral data can be obtained using a single set of cloud parameters ( temperature , density , cloud radius ) via application of our integrated model .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce the time - dependent and steady - state transport equations in spherical geometry , and we map out the general solution methods to be applied in the subsequent sections . in section",
    "3 we obtain the solution for the fourier transform of the time - dependent photon green s function and also the solution for the time - averaged green s function in a homogeneous corona . in section  4 ,",
    "we repeat the same steps for the case of an inhomogeneous corona with electron number density profile @xmath39 .",
    "we discuss the reprocessing of thermal bremsstrahlung radiation in section  5 , and we apply the integrated model to cyg  x-1 and gx  339 - 04 in section  6 .",
    "our main conclusions are reviewed and further discussed in section  7 .",
    "our focus here is on understanding how time - dependent compton scattering affects a population of seed photons as they propagate through a spherical corona of hot electrons overlying a geometrically thin , standard accretion disk .",

    "the transient that produces the soft seed photons is not treated in detail here , but we note that the outer edge of the corona is a region which the disk suddenly expands in the vertical direction , possibly leading to various types of plasma instabilities . in particular , the abrupt change in magnetic topology may generate rapid reconnection events that can result in the injection of a significant population of soft seed photons via bremsstrahlung emission ( e.g. , poutanen & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast with the behavior of the monochromatic injection scenario studied by miyamoto ( 1988 ) , the results depicted in figure  6 show that in the case of broadband ( bremsstrahlung ) seed photon injection into either a homogeneous or inhomogeneous cloud , comptonization can produce fourier frequency - dependent time lags that agree with the observational data for both cyg  x-1 and gx  339 - 04 .",
    "the diminishing time lags at high fourier frequency are explained as a natural results of the prompt escape of broadband seed photons , combined with the delayed escape of upscattered comptonized photons over longer timescales .",
    "this indicates that the critical quantities for determining the shape of the time - lag profile are the overall optical thickness of the cloud and its temperature , which have nearly the same values in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous corona models .",
    "we therefore conclude that the actual configuration of the cloud ( i.e. the detailed radial variation of the electron number density ) is not well constrained by either the observations of the time lags or the observations of the time - averaged x - ray spectrum , and indeed , either cloud configuration works equally well , although there is a slight difference in the resulting cloud radius @xmath36 , as indicated in table  2 .      in our model ,",
    "the time lags are computed based on analytical expressions for the fourier transform of the emitted radiation spectrum .",
    "since these expressions are stated in terms of series expansions , it is important to examine the convergence of the results obtained for the time lags as one increases the truncation level of the series .",

    "the red and blue curves are the same as the final results for the time lags plotted in figure  6 .",
    "the time lags generally require about 20 terms to fully converge , whereas the expansions for the time - averaged spectra converge immediately ( see figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "we have obtained the exact analytical solution for the problem of time - dependent thermal comptonization in a spherical scattering corona , based on two different electron density profiles . by working in the fourier domain ,",
    "we have obtained a closed - form expression for the green s function corresponding to the injection of monochromatic seed photons into a cloud at a single radius and time .",
    "the radiated fourier transform , evaluated at the surface of the cloud , can be directly substituted into the time lag formula introduced by van der klis et al .",
    "( 1987 ) in order to compute the predicted dependence of the lags on the fourier frequency for any selected x - ray channel energies . in our approach , the time - averaged x - ray spectrum and the time lags are both computed using the same set of physical parameters to describe the properties of the scattering cloud , and therefore our formalism represents an integrated model that fully describes the high - energy spectral and timing properties of the source .",
    "the study presented by hkc is similar to ours , although their methodology and input assumptions are somewhat different .",
    "hkc focused exclusively on a single injection scenario , namely the injection of essentially monoenergetic , low - temperature blackbody seed photons at the center of the scattering cloud .",
    "based on this injection spectrum , they concluded that the observed time lag behavior in cyg  x-1 could not be reproduced unless the electron number density profile was inhomogeneous , with @xmath34 for example . in this case , although the predicted time lags fit the observed dependence on the fourier period , the resulting dimensions of the cloud are so large that the requisite heating is difficult to accomplish based on any of the standard dissipation models .",
    "another notable difference between the work of hkc and the results developed here is that we have obtained a set of exact mathematical solutions , whereas hkc utilized a numerical monte carlo simulation method .",
    "this distinction is important , because by exploiting the exact solution for the fourier transform of the green s function , we are able to explore a much wider range of injection scenarios , in which we can vary both the location of the initial flash of seed photons , and its spectral distribution .",
    "based on our analytical formalism , we are able to confirm the results of hkc regarding monochromatic injection , but we have also generalized those results by exploring the implications of varying the seed photon injection radius and spectrum .",
    "we find that the injection of _ broadband _ ( bremsstrahlung ) seed photons relatively close to the surface of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous cloud can fit the observed time lag profiles at least as well as the hkc model does , but with a cloud size an order of magnitude smaller . in section  7.2",
    "we discuss the physical reasons underlying the success of the bremsstrahlung injection scenario .",
    "the treatment of electron scattering in our work differs from that utilized by hkc , since we have adopted the thomson cross section , whereas hkc implemented the full expression for the klein - nishina cross section . in principle ,",
    "utilization of the klein - nishina cross section would be expected to affect the hard time lags , due to the quantum reduction in the scattering probability at high energies . however , for the photon energy range of interest here , @xmath369kev , combined with our maximum electron temperature , @xmath370kev , not many photons are likely to sample the reduced cross section , which requires an incident photon energy exceeding @xmath371kev as seen in the rest frame of the electron . hence it seems surprising that hkc observed a significant change in the normalization of their computed time lags when they adopted the klein - nishina cross section instead of the thomson value .",
    "we suspect that this may be due to the somewhat higher electron temperature they used , @xmath372kev .    to explore this question quantitatively , we can compute the fraction of electrons such that an incident photon of a given energy in the lab frame exceeds @xmath371kev in the electron s rest frame . the relevant thermal distribution function for the calculation",
    "is the relativistic maxwell - jttner distribution , given by ( e.g. , ter haar & wergeland 1971 ; hua 1997 ) @xmath373 where @xmath374 and @xmath375 denotes the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the probability that a randomly - selected electron has a lorentz factor in the range between @xmath376 and @xmath377 is equal to @xmath378 .    in order to compute an upper bound on the probability of generating a scattering in the klein - nishina regime , we shall focus on the most energetic possible collision scenario , which is a head - on collision between the electron and the photon . in this case , the incident photon energy in the electron s rest frame , @xmath379 , is given by @xmath380 where @xmath381 is the incident photon energy in the lab frame . by integrating the maxwell - jttner distribution , we can compute the probability , @xmath382 , that a randomly - selected electron has sufficient energy to create the required incident photon energy of at least @xmath371kev in the rest frame .",
    "the probability is given by @xmath383 where the lower bound @xmath384 is the root of the equation @xmath385 setting the incident photon energy @xmath386kev as an extreme example , we find that the lower bound is @xmath387 . adopting the hkc temperature value , @xmath372kev , we obtain @xmath388 , in which case the probability given by equation  ( [ maxjutprob ] ) is @xmath389",
    ". this probability may be large enough to explain the variation of the hkc time lag results observed when they switched between the thomson cross section and the klein - nishina cross section , if some of the photons inverse - compton scatter up to high enough energies to sample the klein - nishina regime , before returning to lower energies via compton scattering .",
    "we can also compute the scattering probability @xmath382 based on the maximum electron temperature that we have adopted in our applications , @xmath370kev , which yields @xmath390 . in this case",
    ", one finds that the maxwell - jttner integration gives @xmath391 , which is much smaller than the hkc result .",
    "hence we conclude that utilization of the klein - nishina cross section would probably not make a significant difference in our applications .",
    "however , we ca nt reach any definitive conclusions about this question using the model developed here since it is based on the assumption of thomson scattering in the electron s rest frame .",
    "the somewhat surprising difference between the time lag profiles produced when the injection spectrum has a monoenergetic shape versus a broadband shape can be explored by using the inverse fourier transform to compute the time - dependent light curves for the hard and soft energy channels in the two cases . to accomplish this , we must make use of the inversion integral ( cf .",

    "evaluation of equation  ( [ eq132 ] ) requires numerical integration since the inversion integral can not be performed analytically .",
    "we therefore focus on a few simple examples in order to illustrate the dependence of the light curves on the injection model .    in figure  9 , we plot the hard and soft channel light curves computed using equation  ( [ eq132 ] ) for the case of a homogeneous cloud experiencing impulsive injection of either low - energy monochromatic seed photons or broadband ( bremsstrahlung ) seed photons .",
    "the parameters describing the monochromatic injection scenario are temperature @xmath393 , injection location @xmath394 , injection energy @xmath320kev , soft channel energy @xmath358kev , and hard channel energy @xmath365kev . in the case of bremsstrahlung injection , we set @xmath393 , @xmath394 , @xmath395kev , @xmath358kev , and @xmath396kev",
    ". one can immediately identify the characteristic fast rise exponential decay ( fred ) shape ( e.g. , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) for each channel signal . as expected ,",
    "the hard channel curve is delayed in time relative to the soft channel curve due to upscattering , but the detailed relationship between the two light curves depends qualitatively on whether the injection spectrum is monochromatic or broadband .",
    "one clearly observes that the two fred curves resulting from monochromatic injection in a homogeneous cloud are of the same shape , and are simply shifted by a perfect delay with respect to one another on all timescales ( see figure  9 ) .",
    "this yields a constant time lag across all fourier frequencies ( or periods ) , in agreement with the miyamoto result that hkc and kb have confirmed .",
    "our physical understanding of this behavior is as follows .",
    "since all of the initial photons start with the same energy in the monochromatic case , the time lag is purely a result of compton reverberation , where the upscattering timescale is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of the hard to soft energies ( payne 1980 ) .",
    "based on this simple example , we conclude that monochromatic injection anywhere in a homogeneous cloud can not produce fourier frequency - dependent time lags , in contradiction with the observational data .",
    "the relationship between the two fred light curves plotted in figure  9 for the case of bremsstrahlung injection is qualitatively different from the monochromatic example . in this case , the initial fast rise in both channels is coherent , meaning that the hard and soft channel signals track each other relatively closely .",
    "this results in a small time lag at high fourier frequencies , because the fast rise portion of each curve represents the most rapid variation in the system .",
    "physically , this part of the process corresponds to the prompt escape of `` pristine '' bremsstrahlung seed photons that are almost unaffected by scattering . because bremsstrahlung is a broadband emission mechanism ,",
    "both hard and soft photons exist in the initial distribution , and the prompt escape is therefore coherent across the energy channels .",
    "this is , of course , _ not _ true in the case of low - energy monochromatic injection , because in that scenario , photons require sufficient time to upscatter into both the soft and hard energy channels .    at longer timescales ( smaller fourier frequencies ) in the bremsstrahlung case ,",
    "the hard light curve approaches a delayed version of the soft light curve , reflecting the time it takes for the photons to compton upscatter to the hard channel energy .",
    "this part of the process is similar to the monochromatic case , and indeed , we see that the time lags level off to a plateau at small fourier frequencies , just as in the monochromatic example",
    ". to summarize , the overall behavior of the bremsstrahlung injection model matches the observational data much more closely then does the monochromatic injection scenario because of the combination of prompt escape ( the fast rise part of the light curves ) along with compton reverberation ( exponential decay ) on longer timescales .",
    "this explains the origin of the qualitative difference in the behavior of the time lags at high fourier frequencies exhibited in the monochromatic and bremsstrahlung injection scenarios , depicted in figures  5 and 6 , respectively .      both our model and that analyzed by hkc require the presence of hot electrons with temperature @xmath397k at distances @xmath398 from the black hole .",
    "this temperature distribution is consistent with a substantial number of studies that focus on energy transport in inefficient accretion flows , with accretion rates that are significantly sub - eddington , as first established by nayaran & yi ( 1995 ) in the context of the original , self - similar advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model .",
    "similar results for the temperature distribution were later obtained using more complex numerical simulations by oda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , rajesh & mukhopadhyay ( 2010 ) , yuan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , mandal & chakrabarti ( 2005 ) , liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , raska & czerny ( 2000 ) , and you et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . in these hot adaf flows",
    ", the density in the outer region is so low that bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton cooling are very inefficient . the lack of efficient cooling drives the electron temperature in the corona close to the virial value , out to distances of hundreds or thousands of gravitational radii from the black hole , in agreement with the temperature profiles assumed here .    in the study presented here",
    ", we have assumed that the electron scattering corona is isothermal in order to accomplish the separation of variables that is required to obtain analytical solutions to the radiation transport equation .",
    "the resulting analytical solutions allow us to determine the physical properties of the scattering corona in a given source by computing the time - averaged x - ray spectrum and the time - lag profile and comparing the theoretical results with the observational data .",
    "the assumption of an isothermal corona is roughly justified by studies indicating that the temperature does not vary by more than a factor of a few across the corona ( e.g. , you et al .",
    "2012 ; schnittman et al .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth asking whether our results would be significantly modified in the presence of a coronal temperature gradient .",
    "if the electron temperature varied across the corona , then in general one would expect the plasma to be hotter in the inner region , where the density is likely to be higher as well . in this scenario ,",
    "the photons in the hot inner region would compton upscatter faster than those in the cooler outer region , but they would spend more time ( on average ) scattering through the cloud before escaping due to the greater optical depth in the inner region .",
    "we estimate that these two effects would roughly offset each other , leaving the time lag profile close to the isothermal result derived here , if the temperature were set equal to the average value in the corona .",
    "hence we predict that the results obtained for the time lags in the presence of a temperature gradient would be qualitatively similar to those obtained here using the isothermal assumption",
    ". moreover , while the electrons may approach the virial temperature in the outer region , it is likely that in the inner region , the electron temperature is thermostatically controlled by compton scattering ( e.g. , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) .",
    "the combination of these two effects will tend to produce a relatively high , but uniform , electron temperature distribution , as we have assumed here .",
    "if the transients responsible for producing the observed x - ray time lags in accreting black hole sources are driven by the deposition of a large amount of energy , then the properties of the corona ( temperature , density ) would be expected to respond .",
    "if this response occurs on time scales comparable to the diffusion time for photons to escape from the corona , then the resulting time lag profiles would be modified compared with the results obtained here , since we assume that the properties of the corona remain constant .",
    "malzac & jourdain ( 2000 ) have considered the possible variation of the coronal properties during x - ray flares using a non - linear monte carlo simulation to study the flare evolution as a function of time , along with the associated variation of the temperature and optical depth in the corona .",
    "they do not compute fourier time lags , but they do present simulated light curves in the soft and hard energy channels . in their model ,",
    "the flares are driven by a sudden increase in the disk s internal dissipation , which produces a large quantity of soft photons .",
    "the temperature and optical depth of the corona change self - consistently during the transient , and then return to the equilibrium state .",
    "they find that hard time lags are produced during the flare if the energy deposition is substantial .",
    "the approach taken by malzac & jourdain ( 2000 ) is based on the pulse - avalanche model of poutanen & fabian ( 1999 ) .",
    "the model does not explicitly include compton upscattering as a contributor to the time - lag phenomenon , nor was the significance of the injection spectrum considered .",
    "the simulated light curves generated by malzac & jourdain ( 2000 ) sometimes display temporal dips , but the time dependence does nt seem to resemble that observed during the transients in cyg  x-1 . since these authors do not compute fourier time lags ,",
    "it is difficult to directly compare their results with ours .",
    "however , we note that the transients under study here represent relatively small variations in the x - ray luminosity , which suggests that the energy deposition may not be large enough to significantly alter the large - scale properties of the scattering corona during the time it takes the photons to diffuse out of the cloud ( nowak et a. 1999 ; cassatella et al .",
    "this supports our assumption that the temperature and density of the corona remain essentially constant during the formation of the observed time lags .",
    "our goal in this paper is to develop an integrated model , based on the diffusion and thermal comptonization of seed photons in an optically - thick scattering cloud , that can naturally reproduce both the observed x - ray spectra and the time lags for cyg  x-1 and gx  339 - 04 using a single set of cloud parameters ( density , radius , temperature ) .",
    "we have derived and presented a new set of exact mathematical solutions describing the comptonization of seed photons injected into a scattering cloud of finite size that is either homogeneous , or possesses an electron number density that varies with radius as @xmath34 .",
    "the results developed here include new expressions for ( a ) the green s function describing the radiated time - averaged x - ray flux ( corresponding to the reprocessing of continually injected monochromatic seed photons ) , ( b ) the green s function for the fourier transform of the time - dependent radiation spectrum resulting from the impulsive injection of monochromatic seed photons , and ( c ) the associated x - ray fourier time lags .    by exploiting the linearity of the fundamental transport equation , we used our results for the green s function to explore a variety of seed photon injection scenarios .",
    "one of our main conclusions is that the integrated model can successfully explain the data regardless of the cloud configuration ( homogeneous or inhomogeneous ) , provided the optical thickness and the temperature are comparable in the two models , as expected based on the compton reverberation scenario ( payne 1980 ) .",
    "our results demonstrate that the bremsstrahlung injection model fits the observational time - lag data reasonably well for both cyg  x-1 and gx  339 - 04 , whether the scattering corona is homogeneous or inhomogeneous .",
    "we therefore conclude that the constant time lags found by hkc in the homogeneous cloud configuration were the result of their utilization of a quasi - monochromatic ( low - temperature blackbody ) injection spectrum for the seed photon distribution .",
    "the injection location in our model is different from that considerd by hkc , who assumed that the seed photons were always injected at the center of the spherical cloud . in our model ,",
    "the injection location is arbitrary , and we find that the best agreement with the time lag data is obtained when the injection is relatively close to the surface of the cloud , so that the prompt escape of some of the unprocessed bremsstrahlung seed photons is able to explain the diminishing time lags observed at high fourier frequencies . at longer timescales ,",
    "the standard thermal comptonization process sets the delay between the soft and hard channels , and this naturally leads to the observed plateau in the time lags at low fourier frequencies .    in future work",
    ", we plan to develop a more general green s function in which the injection occurs on a ring or a point , rather than on a spherical shell as in the model considered here . as in the present paper , the resulting fourier transform of the time - dependent green s function in the general case",
    "will allow us to investigate a variety of seed photon energy distributions ( e.g. , blackbody or bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "the additional geometric flexibility in the general model should allow us to further improve the agreement between the model predictions and the data , hence providing new insights into the structure of the scattering corona and the underlying accretion disk .",
    "we also plan to examine scenarios in which the electrons cool during the transient in response to the upscattering of the injected photons .",
    "this may help to explain the soft time lags observed in some accreting black - hole sources ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous referee who provided a variety of insightful comments that helped to strengthen and clarify the results presented here .",
    "in order to use the series expansions developed in sections  3 and 4 to represent the green s functions for the time - averaged ( quiescent ) spectrum and for the fourier transform of the time - dependent spectrum , it is necessary to establish the orthogonality of the various spatial eigenfunctions . in this section ,",
    "we present a global proof of orthogonality of the spatial eigenfunctions for both the homogeneous case ( utilizing the mirror inner boundary condition ) and for the inhomogeneous case ( utilizing the dual free - streaming boundary condition ) .",
    "first we define the generic spatial ode , encompassing equations  ( [ eq44 ] ) , ( [ eq67 ] ) , ( [ eq83 ] ) , and ( [ eq102 ] ) , by writing @xmath399 such that , @xmath400 @xmath401 and @xmath402    to establish orthogonality , we multiply equation  ( [ eq133 ] ) by @xmath403 and then duplicate it with the indices exchanged , after which we subtract the second equation from the first , yielding @xmath404 next , we integrate by parts with respect to @xmath70 over the computational domain @xmath405 to obtain , after simplification , @xmath406 the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq138 ] ) needs to be evaluated separately for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases , since the spatial boundary conditions are different in the two situations .",
    "we consider each of these cases in turn below .",
    "for the homogeneous cloud configuration , with @xmath78 and @xmath128 , the inner and outer spatial boundary conditions can be written as ( cf .",
