    "in the standard cosmological model , the universe is dominated by cold dark matter combined with a cosmological constant or dark energy ( @xmath7cdm ) . while the existence of dark matter is supported by dynamical tests , gravitational lensing and fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ,",
    "the evidence for a cosmological constant is primarily through geometric constraints on the redshift - distance relation ( standard candles , standard rulers ) and hence on the expansion history of the universe ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wmap7+bao+@xmath8 ) .",
    "modified gravity theories , however , can mimic the expansion history of the @xmath7cdm model .",
    "@xcite has emphasized that it is essential to measure the growth of structure as a function of cosmic time as this allows one to break this degeneracy .",
    "he also shows that for many models , the logarithmic derivative of the growth of structure can be parametrized as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the redshift , @xmath11 is the linear perturbation growth factor , @xmath12 is the expansion factor and @xmath5 is 0.55 for @xmath7cdm @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for example , @xmath13 in the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dgp ) braneworld modified gravity model @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to measure the amplitude of the dark matter power spectrum at redshifts lower than that of the cmb , including cosmic shear from weak gravitational lensing and the abundance of rich clusters .",
    "another promising way to probe the growth _ rate _ of structure is via peculiar velocities @xcite .",
    "peculiar velocities are directly proportional to the derivative of the growth factor , i.e.  proportional to @xmath14",
    ".    there are two ways to measure peculiar velocities .",
    "the first method is statistical : given a galaxy redshift survey , the distortion of the power spectrum or correlation function in redshift space depends on @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a galaxy bias parameter @xcite . on large scales",
    ", we may assume that linear biasing holds , i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the root - mean - square density contrast within an 8 mpc/@xmath19 sphere , @xmath19 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc , and the subscript `` g '' indicates the fluctuations in the galaxy density , whereas no subscript indicates fluctuations in the mass density contrast .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys also allow one to measure @xmath20 directly , so one can combine the observables to obtain the combination @xmath21 . by combining redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) measurements of @xmath22 at different redshifts",
    ", one can study the growth of linear structures over a range of redshifts @xcite .",
    "a second method is to measure peculiar velocities directly , by measuring distances to individual galaxies ( via standard candles or standard rulers ) , and comparing these distances to their redshifts .",
    "we refer to this method as  measured distance \" ( md ) .",
    "the measured peculiar velocities can then be compared with the peculiar velocities predicted from a galaxy density field , @xmath23 , derived from an independent redshift survey , under the assumption that fluctuations in the mass are linearly related to those in the galaxy density . specifically , we have @xcite @xmath24 this comparison of the two measured quantities @xmath25 and @xmath23 yields a measurement of the degenerate combination @xmath15 , which can be converted into the combination @xmath26 in the same way as for rsds . note that because this is a velocity - density cross - correlation , unlike rsds , it is not affected by cosmic variance .",
    "instead , the noise arises from the precision of the mds themselves .",
    "the two peculiar velocity probes are complementary : rsds require large volumes , driving one to surveys at higher redshifts .",
    "mds have errors which are a constant fraction of distance .",
    "hence the error in peculiar velocity in units of increases linearly with distance and so md surveys are necessarily restricted to low redshifts . however , as we will show it is the lowest redshift data that have the most `` lever arm '' for constraining the cosmological parameters considered here .",
    "the important point is that by combining high and low redshift measurements of @xmath27 , we can break many degeneracies in the cosmological parameters .",
    "an outline of this letter is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the data used in our analysis .",
    "section 3 presents fits in the @xmath28-@xmath2 plane for the @xmath7cdm class of models . in section 4 ,",
    "we allow @xmath5 to vary , but use cmb data to constrain the amplitude of @xmath29 .",
    "we discuss future prospects in section 5 and summarize in section 6 .",
    "we will combine measurements of @xmath22 from the two distinct methods discussed above .",
    "the majority of the data are from rsd measurements , many of which were previously compiled in @xcite , but adding recent results from boss @xcite and 6dfgs @xcite .",
    "these are summarized in table 1 .",
    "lcccl thf & 0.02 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & 1 + dnm & 0.02 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & 2 + 6df & 0.07 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & 3 + 2df & 0.17 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & 4 + lrg1 & 0.25 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & 5 + lrg2 & 0.37 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 & 5 + wz1 & 0.22 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & 6 + wz2 & 0.41 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & 6 + wz3 & 0.6 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & 6 + wz4 & 0.78 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & 6 + boss & 0.57 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & 7 + vvds & 0.77 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & 8    as discussed above , it is also possible to measure @xmath54 from the comparison of peculiar velocity and density fields , where peculiar velocities are obtained directly from mds .",
    "most of the results from this method ( up to 2005 ) were summarized in table 3 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ph ) .",
    "they showed that results from estimates of @xmath54 were consistent and making an additional correction from the non - linear @xmath55 using @xcite and assuming @xmath56 . ] with @xmath57 .",
    "however , since both the peculiar velocity and redshift survey datasets overlap somewhat , the measurements are not independent and it is therefore difficult to assess the uncertainties .    its possible to obtain a value of @xmath54 using non - overlapping datasets : by comparing peculiar velocities from the `` composite '' sample of @xcite to predictions derived from the iras point source catalog redshift ( pscz ) survey galaxy density field @xcite , we find @xmath58 after marginalizing over residual bulk flows .",
    "this yields @xmath59 , in good agreement with the ph mean value quoted above .",
    "these uncertainties may underestimate possible systematics , however , since only one density field ( pscz ) is used and , furthermore , the same comparison method is used for all peculiar velocity samples .",
    "therefore , in order to make a fair ( albeit conservative ) estimate of the uncertainties in the methods , in this letter we focus on only two recent measurements of @xmath26 from md surveys .",
    "the first of these is from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter thf ) , who compiled the ` first amendment ' ( hereafter a1 ) set of 245 peculiar velocities from type ia supernovae ( sne ) with @xmath60 .",
    "the a1 peculiar velocities were compared to predictions from the iras pscz galaxy density field , yielding @xmath61 at a characteristic depth of @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the uncertainties on @xmath26 are marginalized over possible residual bulk flows .",
    "the results are also insensitive to details of , for example , corrections for extinction in the sn host instead of the default @xmath63 changes @xmath26 by only 0.05 .",
    "@xcite fit @xmath64 , so the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a factor 2.8 times the systematic error . hence the 1-@xmath67 @xmath68 systematic effect on @xmath22 ( @xmath69 ) is much smaller than the random errors ( @xmath70 ) ] .",
    "further details about the uncertainties and light curve fitters used for the a1 sne can be found in thf .",
    "the second low-@xmath10 md result is from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dnm ) , who analyzed 2830 tully - fisher peculiar velocities at @xmath71 and compared these to the predictions from the galaxy density field derived from the two micron all - sky survey redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the analysis differs from thf : rather than the simple point - by - point comparison of predicted and observed peculiar velocities , dnm applied a spherical harmonic decomposition to both fields and found @xmath72 .",
    "we note that a straight average of the thf and dnm results yields @xmath73 in excellent agreement with the composite vs. pscz result found above .",
    "we stress the that these two distance measurement results are completely independent : they use different peculiar velocity samples , different density fields and different reconstruction and comparison methods .",
    "the two measurements are consistent with each other : the difference in @xmath22 is @xmath74 . the rsd and md measurements are shown in figure [ fig : fsig8 ] .     as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the data and errorbars are labelled as in table 1 . the @xmath7cdm model with wmap7+bao+@xmath8 parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76",
    "is shown by the solid magenta curve .",
    "note that the high - redshift rsd points assume the @xmath7cdm redshift - distance relation to correct for the ap effect and hence the appropriate value of @xmath77 .",
    "the dotted curves are normalized to have the correct @xmath18 at @xmath78 but have different possible @xmath5 values starting at 0.50 at the top and increasing in steps of 0.05 towards the bottom . the dashed and dash - dot curves show predictions of flat and open dgp models , respectively , normalized to the amplitude of the fluctuations in the cmb ( see text for details ) .",
    "[ fig : fsig8 ] ]",
    "in the @xmath7cdm model , @xmath79 . the model allows us to predict the value of @xmath80 and @xmath81 at any redshift , assuming their values at redshift @xmath82 ( denoted by subscript `` 0 '' ) . for the fits",

    "* hereafter ap ) effect .",
    "if we assume a flat universe , then the redshift - distance relation , and hence the ap distortion are all fixed by our choice of @xmath28 . with the ap distortion fixed , the appropriate @xmath22 values can then be calculated , but only for those surveys that have published the covariance matrix between the ap effect and @xmath54 : wz and boss .",

    "[ fig : omsig8 ] ]    figure [ fig : omsig8 ] shows the results of the fit in the @xmath28 versus @xmath2 parameter plane with @xmath79 .",
    "while the wz+boss - only fit is quite degenerate in the @xmath89 plane , these degeneracies are broken when low-@xmath10 data are included in the fit . assuming a fixed @xmath79 , the best fit is @xmath3 and @xmath4 but the wmap7+bao+@xmath8 value is consistent with these results .",
    "some @xmath7cdm variants , such as those with a non - standard effective number of relativistic species , are disfavored .",
    "the figure shows one such example ( @xmath90 ) , from @xcite .",
    "we stress that these results depend only on growth measurements and hence are independent of other determinations ( cmb , sne , bao etc . )",
    "as discussed above , it is also interesting to measure the growth rate index @xmath5 .",
    "however , once @xmath5 is included as a third parameter , the fits become very degenerate .",
    "these degeneracies can be broken using cmb data , for example from wmap7+bao+@xmath87 .",
    "let us assume that the friedman equation ( and hence the expansion history ) is the same as for the @xmath7cdm model , but treat @xmath5 as a phenomenological growth parameter which is allowed to differ from 0.55 . at high redshifts ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 to high accuracy and",

    "although for purposes of illustration we have focussed on a constant scale - independent @xmath5 , peculiar velocity data also allow one to test more complicated modified gravity scenarios ( see e.g.  the review by * ? ? ?",
    "one example is the dgp braneworld model .",
    "1 shows the predicted values of @xmath22 for a self - accelerating flat dgp model , with parameters chosen to match the expansion history and cmb constraints @xcite , and with a perturbation amplitude at early times chosen to match the cmb .",

    "furthermore , its @xmath13 also differs considerably from the @xmath7cdm value .",
    "these effects lead to lower growth and much lower values of @xmath22 at @xmath103 .",
    "this model , already disfavored at the @xmath104 level from other data @xcite , is excluded at the @xmath105 level using only the @xmath22 measurements discussed here .",
    "an open dgp model , which is a better fit to the redshift - distance relation , is excluded at the @xmath106 level by growth measurements alone .",
    "this suggests that alternative modified gravity models will be strongly constrained by the requirement of simultaneously matching the @xmath7cdm expansion history and the @xmath7cdm growth history .",
    "the prospects for improving the measurements of @xmath5 are excellent . at present , the error budget is _ dominated _ by the wmap7+bao+@xmath8 estimates of the parameters at high redshift .",
    "planck will reduce the cmb uncertainties so that these become subdominant .",
    "peculiar velocity measurements will continue to improve , leading to a reduction in the observational errors in @xmath54 .",
    "the boss measurement will improve with further data releases .",
    "rsd measurements are also being made at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "however the statistical power _ all _ of the rsd measurements combined ( which are based on 800,000 redshifts ) is similar to that of md ( based only on @xmath107 peculiar velocity measurements ) , the subsamples having uncertainties of 0.060 and 0.077 respectively in @xmath5 ( table 2 ) .",
    "it is therefore clearly of great interest to improve the statistics of mds . at low redshift",
    ", supernovae will continue to accumulate .",
    "we can also look forward to fundamental plane peculiar velocities from 6dfgs @xcite , and later an order of magnitude increase in the number of tully - fisher peculiar velocities from wallaby .",
    "finally , the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect will be used to measure the velocity field of clusters at intermediate redshift @xcite .",
    "the redshift survey data used to construct the density field and hence the predicted peculiar velocities is also improving @xcite .",
    "it remains to better understand systematics , by comparing measurements using the same sets of peculiar velocity and density data , but different methods .",
    "we have shown that by combining measurements of @xmath77 at different redshifts , and in particular by including results at @xmath108 from md surveys , we can break the degeneracy between @xmath28 and @xmath2 and obtain @xmath3 and @xmath4 , consistent with independent determinations from wmap7+bao+@xmath8 .",
    "we can also constrain the growth index @xmath5 by comparing measurements of @xmath77 at low @xmath10 , after fixing their values at @xmath78 . the strongest leverage on @xmath5",
