    "scalability and fault - tolerance are essential ingredients in both classical and quantum computation . in 1945 , von neumann proposed the first architecture design of a classical computer @xcite , and most of today s classical computers are of von neumann type .",
    "he also explored fault - tolerance in classical computation by developing a systematic way to construct reliable logic circuits from noisy devices @xcite , which is now attracting renewed interest in the field of nanocomputer @xcite .    in quantum computation , on the other hand",
    ", it is still under extensive investigation what type of physical system is best suited to an experimental realization of quantum computation and what level of accuracy is required for it . for a better understanding of them , a lot of efforts have been made over the past decade both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "quantum fault - tolerance theory ensures scalable quantum computation with noisy quantum devices as long as the error probability of such devices is smaller than a threshold value ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the noise thresholds have been calculated to be about @xmath1@xmath2 for several fault - tolerant schemes under various assumptions @xcite . in the experiments , it is nowadays possible to control a few to dozen qubits in a wide variety of physical systems such as trapped ions @xcite and nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centres in diamond @xcite etc .",
    "( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there is , however , still a large gap between these top - down ( theoretical ) and bottom - up ( experimental ) approaches .",
    "for example , the existing fault - tolerant schemes @xcite require many qubits live together in a single system and assume that the whole system can be controlled with the same accuracy regardless of its size . in experiment , on the other hand ,",
    "the number of qubits in a single system is rather limited ; if we increase the number of qubits in a single system , the control becomes more and more complex , which makes it hard to achieve the same accuracy .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite there is a consensus that  for practical scalability the probability of error introduced by the application of a quantum gate must be less than 0.0001 \" . in order to fill the gap and break through the consensus , we have to develop a fundamental design of a scalable and fault - tolerant architecture for quantum computation as von neumann did in the early years of classical computer technology .",
    "several architectures for scalable quantum computation have been proposed so far in bottom - up approaches by considering specific physical implementations such as photons @xcite and semiconductor nanophotonics @xcite .",
    "it is , however , still not fully understood what kind of elements and what level of accuracies of them are essentially required to construct a scalable and fault - tolerant architecture .",
    "furthermore , the requirements of the existing quantum architectures are too demanding and complicated to be experimentally feasible . in this paper , we propose a fundamental and simple design of a scalable and fault - tolerant architecture for quantum computation taking a top - down approach , and clarify under what condition scalable quantum computation can be executed fault - tolerantly .    to ensure scalability ,",
    "we adopt a distributed approach to quantum computation @xcite , where small quantum systems , say _ quantum arithmetic logic units _ ( qalus ) , are connected via quantum channels .",
    "this type of architectures are equipped with built - in modular scalability .",
    "that is , the size of the architecture scales up by adding well - established individual units . in the previous one - dimensional ( 1d )",
    "distributed architecture @xcite , however , entangled states have to be shared between qalus of arbitrary distance , and therefore the quantum repeater protocol @xcite is utilised .",
    "as the distance gets larger , this procedure takes more time .",
    "moreover , every qalu in - between must provide a workspace for this procedure , resulting in an overhead which grows with the distance .",
    "besides , if there is a single point of breakdown in the quantum channels possibly due to a manufacturing error , one can not generate any entanglement between two parts separated by this point .",
    "the present architecture , on the other hand , consists of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of qalus , each of which consists of four qubits , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ architecture ] .",
    "furthermore , entangled states are shared only between the nearest - neighbour qalus , which allows highly parallel operations .",
    "surprisingly , this simple architecture is found to be sufficient for fault - tolerant quantum computation and works with very noisy quantum channels of fidelity @xmath3 and reasonably accurate local operations of the error probability @xmath4 , which breaks through the consensus by one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "these results are achieved by utilizing twofold error management techniques : entanglement purification @xcite and topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite .",
    "the former is employed to implement a reliable two - qubit gate by using very noisy quantum channels with the help of quantum gate teleportation @xcite .",
    "in particular , we apply high - performance entanglement purification , so - called _",
    "double selection scheme _",
    "@xcite , which is essential for achieving the above result .",
    "tqc is used to handle the remaining errors and to archive quantum gate operations of arbitrary accuracy , which is required for large - scale quantum computation .",
    "furthermore , the nearest - neighbour quantum communications together with tqc is quite robust against the manufacturing error mentioned above , since we can reconstruct a reliable logical information on the surface code by avoiding such defects @xcite .",
    "all key ingredients in the present architecture , ( i ) a four - qubit system , ( ii ) gate operations in the four - qubit system , and ( iii ) entangling operations between the separate systems , have already been demonstrated experimentally in various physical systems . actually , the benchmarks in trapped ion systems are comparable to the requirements of the proposed architecture .",
    "these results push the realization of large - scale quantum computation within reach of current technology .",
    "we believe that this work providing a fundamental and simple design of a scalable and fault - tolerant architecture for quantum computation fills the gap between the top - down and bottom - up approaches , and gives a good guideline and benchmark in development of devices for quantum computer .",
    "the present architecture consists of a 2d array of well - defined small ( four - qubit ) local quantum systems , qalus ( see fig . [ architecture ] ) , where we can implement the initializations , measurements , and two - qubit gate operations .",
    "these local operations are assumed to be imperfect , which is modeled as follows : ( i ) an ideal two - qubit gate is followed by two - qubit depolarizing noise , @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the pauli matrices ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "( ii ) the measurement of a physical qubit is implemented with an error probability @xmath11 .",
    "the qalus are assumed to work with reasonably high accuracy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the memory error probability is assumed to be sufficiently smaller than that of the operational errors ( as is also the case for most of physical systems ) and ignored for clarity ( otherwise , since the number of waiting steps @xmath13 is finite in the present 2d architecture , we can take the memory errors into account by replacing the error probability @xmath14 of the two - qubit gates with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 indicates the memory error probability per step ) .",
    "such qalus are connected via quantum channels of fidelity @xmath17 . here",
    "the channel fidelity @xmath17 means that we can share a maximally entangled state ( mes ) of fidelity @xmath17 between the nearest - neighbour qalus .",
    "the remote entangling operations can be used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the quantum channels are assumed to be relatively noisy ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) , which relaxes the complexity in scaling up the size of the architecture .",
    "the noise introduced by the quantum channel degrades the accuracy of the gate operation between the separate systems . in classical computation , this kind of obstacles can be overcome by using the multiplexing technique @xcite , where multiple copies of data with majority voting are used to ensure the reliability of logic circuits . in the case of quantum physics , however , we can not make copies of an unknown quantum state due to the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "instead , we can use entanglement purification @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite in order to improve the fidelity of the gate operations between two qalus .",
    "in particular , a novel method is devised to realise gate operations of high accuracy , where an intelligent use of the four - qubit local system allows us to obtain mes of high fidelity even with very noisy quantum channels , as shown below .",
    "the noisy copies of the mes ( we call it  noisy mes \" hereafter ) , which are shared by using the noisy quantum channels , are purified by using the entanglement pumping scheme @xcite as follows [ see fig . [ purification ] ( c ) ] : ( i ) a noisy mes ( we call it the target pair ) is purified by reducing its bit - flip ( @xmath20 ) error via level-1 entanglement pumping with double selection @xcite , where two noisy mess are used as the ancillae",
    ". the phase - flip ( @xmath21 ) error in the target pair increases in this process .",
    "( ii ) another noisy mes is purified by using level-1 entanglement pumping with single selection @xcite , where one noisy mes is used as the ancilla . here",
    "the target pair is untouched .",
    "( iii ) the target pair is purified by reducing its @xmath21 error via level-2 entanglement pumping with double selection , where the successful output state of ( ii ) and one noisy mes are used as the ancillae . here",
    "the increase in the @xmath20 error is kept small thanks to the level-1 pumping in step ( ii ) . at each step , we repeat the pumping process from a few to several times .",
    "then , we finally obtain the level-2 double - pumped mes of high fidelity .",
    "the noisy mes @xmath22 , which is shared by the noisy quantum channel , is described as @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",

    "the gate infidelity is given by @xmath47 , which can be understood from the fact that the ttg is implemented with one purified mes , two local two - qubit gates and measurements @xcite ( see appendix b for details ) .",
    "as shown above , we can perform two - qubit gates of high accuracy between the nearest - neighbour two qalus in the teleportation - based way , but they are still subject to small error . in order to handle this and achieve gate operations of arbitrary accuracy",

    "universal fault - tolerant quantum computation can be achieved by using the state injection and the magic state distillation @xcite .",
    "actually , these operations for fault - tolerant universal quantum computation can be executed by using only 2d nearest - neighbour two - qubit gates and single - qubit measurements @xcite , and therefore tqc is best suited for the present distributed architecture .",
