    "more than 25 years ago mitalas ( 1974 ) firstly suggested that the ( nco ) reaction could play an important role on the onset of the he - flash in the he core of a red giant ( rg ) star .",
    "in fact in high degenerate physical conditions , when the electron fermi energy becomes of the order of the energy threshold for electron capture on 14 ( @xmath6 156 kev ) , a significant amount of 14 can be produced .",
    "it is important to notice that 14 is unstable for @xmath7 decay , so that only for densities greater than a critical value ( @xmath8 g/@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass density and @xmath11 is the number of electrons per baryon ) 14 lives long enough to undergo an @xmath3-capture .",
    "the latter reaction heats up the inner zones of the he core in such a way that the physical conditions suitable for the ignition of he - burning are attained before when compared with structures in which the nco energy contribution is neglected .",
    "this implies that the he core mass at the onset of the central he - flash could be reduced and , as a consequence , the luminosity of both tip of rgb and horizontal branch ( hb ) could be fainter .",
    "this notwithstanding the main conclusion reached by mitalas is that nco reaction does not affect at all the evolution of a rg population ii star because the typical physical conditions of the he core do not allow the onset of electron capture .",
    "however , kaminisi , arai & yoshinaga ( 1975 ) pointed out that mitalas underestimated the cross section of the @xmath3-capture on 14 by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , kaminisi & arai ( 1975 ) compared the energy released by the chain and by a reaction respectively and concluded that nco chain dominates over the a reaction for central temperatures and densities typical of a low metallicity rg star .",
    "a new evaluation of the role played by nco chain has been made by spulak ( 1980 ) .",
    "he pointed out that the onset of this reaction critically depends on the density so that its energy contribution is strongly concentrated toward the center of the he core in a rg structure , while the core he - flash driven by a occurs at the mass point where the temperature is maximum , which is off - center and approximately located at @xmath13 . by accounting for the energy balance between the nco chain , neutrino losses and a reaction , spulak concluded that nco chain is not able to trigger the onset of the he - flash because in a typical low metallicity rg star the central density becomes high enough to trigger the electron capture when the a reaction has already ignited off center and its energy contribution is quite relevant .    in 1984",
    "hashimoto , nomoto , arai & kaminisi ( hashimoto et al . 1984 ) recomputed the cross section for the electron capture on 14 and once again they concluded that nco reaction dominates over a reaction in the ignition of the he - flash .",
    "they also pointed out that the key role played by this reaction strongly depends on the chemical composition of the he core when the central density exceeds the density threshold for the electron capture . using this updated cross section , hashimoto et al .",
    "( 1986 ) showed that nco reaction plays an important role in the onset of the he - flash in he wds accreting helium rich matter directly or as a by - product of an overlying h - burning shell .",
    "moreover , these authors pointed out that nco reaction also affects the evolution of a co wd accreting he rich matter directly or as a by - product of h - burning .",
    "in fact , for low accretion rates ( i.e. smaller than @xmath14 1 ) the energy contribution provided by nco reaction heats up the he layers , thus preventing them to undergo a violent dynamical he - flash and causing an increase in the mass of the co core up to the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "for this reason , woosley & weaver ( 1994 ) included nco chain in their nuclear network to construct the pre - supernova model of cool co wds accreting he rich matter .",
    "their calculations show that nco reaction does not affect the final outcome of the process ( he detonation ) , since the main effect is a slight decrease in the mass of the he layer at the onset of the flash .",
    "more recently piersanti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have included the nco chain in the computation of the evolution of a low mass co wd accreting he rich matter both directly and as a by - product of h - burning shell at rates suitable for the occurrence of a he detonation .",
    "they found that the differences produced by nco chain are quite negligible and pointed out that this result is due to the fact that their initial wd model is an evolutionary one , obtained evolving an intermediate mass star with a moderate mass loss from the zero age main sequence down to the cooling sequence .",
    "in such a model there is no 14 available for nco reaction at the physical base of the he - shell where the he - flash is ignited .    in order to improve our knowledge on the role played by nco chain in the framework of stellar evolution we have included this chain in our nuclear network , and performed several numerical experiments on low mass stars climbing the rgb , on central he - burning models , as well as on low mass co wds accreting he - rich matter .",
    "moreover , we have also analyzed extensively the dependence of the nco energy contribution on stellar metallicity .",
    "the plane of this paper is the following : in  2 we discuss the numerical techniques , the physical assumptions together with the input physics ; in  3 we present the results concerning the evolution along the rgb , while in  4 we discuss the physical and chemical properties of co wds and explore the thermal behavior of a co wd accreting he - rich matter . in  5 a brief discussion and the conclusions close the paper .",
    "all the models have been calculated with an update version of the franec code ( chieffi & straniero 1989 ) , the main differences have been discussed in cassisi et al .",
    "as far as the equation of state ( eos ) is concerned , we adopted the eos computed by straniero ( 1988 ) . for low - temperature ( t @xmath1512000 k ) opacities we adopted the tables provided by alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) while for higher temperatures the tables provided by huebner et al .",
    "( 1977 ) has been used . during the he burning phase we adopted a nuclear network which includes co chain ( @xmath16 ) , no chain ( @xmath17 ) and nco chain ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "all the cross sections are from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) with the exception of @xmath19 for which we adopted the cross section provided by caughlan et al .",
    "( 1985 , for a detailed discussion on the current uncertainty on this reaction see bono et al .",
    "the electron capture on 14 was implemented according to hashimoto et al .",
    "the evolution during the central he burning phase has been computed by taking into account semiconvection but by neglecting breathing pulses ( caputo et al .",
    "the accretion process has been computed by assuming that the accreted matter has the same specific entropy of the matter at the surface of the wd ( limongi & tornamb 1991 ) . for the heavy elements we assumed a solar scaled distribution ( grevesse 1991 ) .",
    "we have computed three different sets of models at different metallicities , - z=0.02 , 0.001 , 0.0001 - from the pre - main sequence phase up to the ignition of the central he - burning . for each set of models we adopted three different evolving masses , namely m=0.6 , 0.7 and 0.8 .",
    "1 shows the @xmath20 plane for selected structures at various luminosity levels along the rgb up to the onset of the he - flash ( the top curve in each panel ) .",
    "the dashed lines display the evolution of the central conditions of the models , while the heavy solid lines on the right of the tracks mark the region in which e - captures occur .",
    "data plotted in this figure show that at higher metallicities ( z=0.02 and 0.001 ) the evolving stars do never attain densities high enough for the occurrence of e - captures . in these structures the nco reaction does not become active at all , and thus it does not provide any contribution to the he - burning . on the contrary , in metal - poor structures ( z=0.0001 ) the density of the central regions becomes higher than the critical density for the onset of the nco chain . therefore its energy contribution might play a role in the he - burning ignition .    to assess in more detail the effect of the nco reaction in metal - poor structures , fig .",
    "2 shows the evolution in the @xmath20 plane of the central conditions for the 0.6 models which include ( dotted line ) or neglect ( solid line ) the nco chain in the nuclear network .",
    "as soon as the central density exceeds the critical value @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , the electron capture becomes active and produces 14 ; the subsequent @xmath3-capture on 14 releases some amount of energy that heats up the center .",
    "however the abundance of 14 nuclei is very low ( @xmath24 by mass ) and , in addition , the energy lost via neutrino emission are always active , and therefore the center is barely heated .",
    "the top left panel of fig .",
    "1 clearly shows that , only the innermost zone of the he - core has a density larger than the critical value , and therefore the point where the he - burning is ignited via a reaction remains completely unaffected .",
    "this implies that at the onset of the he - flash - defined according to sweigart & gross ( 1978 ) as the time when the energy production in the inner regions is greater than the neutrino energy losses - the he - core mass , and in turn the luminosity of the star are the same compared to the case in which nco chain is not accounted for ( see fig .",
    "to investigate the physical and chemical properties of co wds we computed a set of models from the central he burning phase down to the cooling sequence for different metallicities .",
    "figures 4 - 5 show temperature and density profiles ( right panels ) together with the chemical abundances in the most external layers ( left panels ) for each model .",
    "data plotted in the left panels show that the abundance of 14 is equal to zero at the physical base of the he - shell , defined as the zone where the he abundance is y=0.5 by mass .",
    "this is due to the fact that during the previous evolution ( he - shell - burning phase ) 14 has been transformed into @xmath25 via no chain .",
    "in fact , the @xmath26 reaction becomes active at a temperature of the order of @xmath27 k with a mild dependence on density . as a consequence , the innermost zone of the he - shell",
    "is enriched in @xmath25 and deprived in 14 .      as already mentioned ( see  1 ) ,",
    "woosley & weaver ( 1994 ) included nco reaction in their nuclear network to compute the evolution of a low - mass co wd accreting he - rich matter . by comparing their results with those of limongi & tornamb ( 1991 ) ,",
    "it is evident that for accretion rates suitable for the occurrence of a hydrodynamical event ( @xmath28 1 ) , the energy contribution provided by nco chain marginally affects the evolution of the accreting models .",
    "in fact , the final outcome remains an explosion and the only change is a slight reduction in the mass extension of the he layer at the onset of the he - flash .",
    "this result is confirmed by piersanti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who pointed out that if the initial model of the co wd is an evolutionary one , then the influence of the nco chain is negligible due to the lack of 14 at the bottom of the he - shell .",
    "the same occurrence takes place over the thick he - layer , surrounding the co core , where the helium abundance has not been modified by a reaction , but the no reaction has been active .",
    "in addition , these authors noticed that , for a fixed chemical composition of the accreted matter , the energy contribution of nco chain depends on the accretion rate , however the final outcome remaining unchanged .",
    "in fact , a decrease in the accretion rate causes an increase in the he - layer mass at the onset of the he - flash , and an increase in the ignition density as well .",
    "therefore , the 14 shell , defined as the point where the nco reaction energy release is at maximum , can move outward ( in mass ) detaching more and more from the base of the he - shell so that the heating induced by the energy delivered by this chain does not affects the point where the he - flash is ignited .    to investigate more in detail this point we have computed an additional set of models in which he - rich matter ( y=0.98 and z=0.02 ) is accreted onto a cooled down co wd at rates suitable for an he detonation ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the initial model for the co wd has been obtained by evolving a 0.6 pure he star ( y=0.98 , z=0.02 ) from the he main sequence down to the cooling sequence .",
    "the luminosity , the effective temperature , the central temperature , and density of this structure are the following : @xmath30 . a glance at the data plotted in fig .",
    "6 shows that at the physical base of the he - layers the 14 abundance is zero .",
    "the main physical parameters at the onset of the he - flash are listed for each model in table 1 : the first column gives the accretion rate ( 1 ) while the others give the thickness in mass of the he - layers ( solar units ) , the temperature ( k ) , the density ( @xmath31 ) , and the degeneration parameter at the point where the energy production via he - burning attains the maximum value .",
    "the quantities referred to the case which neglects the nco energy contribution are listed in columns 2 to 5 , while those referred to the case which includes the nco reactions are listed in columns 6 to 10 .    fig .",
    "7 shows the evolution in the @xmath20 plane of the bottom of the he layer for models computed at different @xmath32 and neglecting the nco energy contribution .",
    "note that only for accretion rates smaller than @xmath33 1 the nco chain could become active .",
    "in fact , only for these values of @xmath32 the density at the physical base of the he - shell exceeds @xmath21 ( dashed line ) .",
    "8 depicts the evolution in the @xmath20 plane of the base of the he - shell with ( dashed line ) and without ( solid line ) the inclusion of nco reaction in the nuclear network .",
    "the evolution of the mass point where the energy production is at maximum is plotted in fig .",
    "9 . as soon as the density becomes greater than @xmath21 , the nco reaction is ignited and releases a small amount of energy .",
    "the continuous accretion process causes an increase in the shell density ; therefore during the subsequent evolutions the physical conditions suitable for the nco reaction are reached in more and more external layers . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a 14 burning shell forms and moves outward in mass all over the accretion process up to the onset of the he - flash .",
    "interestingly enough , an increase in the accretion rate causes a rapid outward shift of the 14 shell .",
    "this occurrence is simply explained by noting that the he - shell is globally less degenerate due to the increase in the accretion rate .",
    "data plotted in fig . 9 , and the physical parameters listed in table 1 , clearly support the evidence that the effects of nco chain are more relevant at intermediate accretion rates ( @xmath34 1 ) .",
    "in fact , at lower accretion rates the he - shell is more degenerate and the 14 shell detaches more and more from the bottom of the he - shell . on the contrary , for higher accretion rates",
    "the physical conditions suitable for the electron capture are attained when a reaction already produces a huge amount of energy . even at higher accretion rates ( higher than @xmath35 1 )",
    "the density of the he - shell does never exceed the critical density @xmath21 , and therefore the nco reaction does not supply any energy contribution .",
    "this notwithstanding the inclusion of nco energy contribution does not change the final fate of these structures , all of them should undergo an explosive event .",
    "we have shown that the effect of nco reaction on the onset of he - burning in degenerate physical conditions is negligible .",
    "in fact , for low - mass structures climbing the rgb , the models with high metallicity ( z=0.001 and z=0.02 ) do not attain densities so high to ignite the nco reaction , while more metal - poor models present such a low abundance of 14 that the energy released by @xmath3-captures on 14 does not affect the evolution .",
    "of course if the @xmath21 value was smaller than we assumed then the energy contribution of the nco chain should be reevaluated .",
    "accounting for this evidence , we have decided to perform several numerical experiments for a @xmath36 solar metallicity model , arbitrarily decreasing the value of @xmath21 in order to test to what extend present results are affected by the uncertainty on this parameter , as well as to verify if stellar observables allow us to put a firm constraint on this quantity . from the data listed in table 2 , it is possible to notice that a decrease of the order of 20% of @xmath21 has no effect on the evolutionary properties of the model . however , when the value of @xmath21 is decreased by a larger factor , the numerical experiments clearly reveal that the size of the he core at the he flash onset and , in turn , the luminosity of the rgb tip and of the zahb are significantly affected by the nco energy release . in particular , for a decrease of 30% of @xmath21 , we obtain an rgb tip luminosity of @xmath37 and an he core mass of @xmath38 to be compared with the values of the standard case , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 . from an observational point of view , we can estimate that this occurrence produces an increase in the visual magnitude of the rgb tip and of the zahb equal to @xmath41 mag and @xmath42 mag , respectively .",
    "these values are well within the current observational and theoretical uncertainties which still affect these crucial observables ( cassisi et al .",
    "1998 , salaris & cassisi 1998 ) .",
    "however , a further decrease ( @xmath43% ) in the value of @xmath21 ( see data in table 2 ) produces quite larger effects .",
    "these changes could be easily tested , allowing to put a firm constraint on @xmath21 value , once the sample of high - metallicity clusters with reliable rgb tip luminosity estimates will be increased .    following the suggestion of an anonymous referee we also explored the dependence of our results on the value of the @xmath44 cross section .",
    "the current scenario ( funck & langanke 1989 ; goerres et al . 1992 ) states that at low temperatures ( @xmath45 k ) the cross section for this reaction rate is dominated by a direct capture contribution which is affected by an uncertainty of roughly two orders of magnitude . owing to this indisputable fact",
    ", we performed several numerical experiments by arbitrarily changing the value of the cross section for the @xmath3 capture on the 14 .",
    "in particular , the value of @xmath46 by caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) has been multiplied by factors equal to @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    as far as the @xmath51 model at @xmath52",
    "is concerned ( see  3 ) , fig .",
    "10 shows the evolutions of the center in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "data plotted in this figure suggest that an increase in the reaction rate of @xmath44 does not cause a significant change in the canonical scenario , except for a slightly faster release of the energy .",
    "in particular , it is worth noticing that the profiles associated with an increase of one and two order of magnitude overlap , respectively .",
    "this occurrence is a direct consequence of the fact that the efficiency of the nco cycle is only triggered by the e - capture on 14 . on the other hand ,",
    "a decrease in the reaction rate of the @xmath3 capture on the 14 , causes a decrease in the energy released , and in turn an increase in its duration up to the onset of the he - flash . in any case",
    "the he - core mass and the luminosity level of the tip remain unchanged when compared with the standard case .",
    "the same experiments were also performed for the model at @xmath53 and @xmath54 by assuming a decrease of the order of 30% in the transition density for the e - capture .",
    "3 lists the values of the he core mass , central temperature , and density at the onset of the he - flash .",
    "once again the increase in the reaction rate of the @xmath3 capture on the 14 does not cause a significant change of the physical conditions at the onset of the he - flash . on the contrary ,",
    "a decrease in the value of @xmath46 causes a decrease in the degeneration of the he core , and therefore a mild decrease in the he core mass at the onset of the he flash .",
    "unfortunately , the variations in the observables ( luminosity level of tip and horizontal branch ) are too small to constrain the efficiency of this reaction .    in the case of typical mass co wds",
    "accreting he - rich matter we showed that the final outcome depends only on the accretion rate , while the nco reaction only causes a slight decrease in the he layers mass at the he - flash .",
    "this occurrence implies that the inclusion of the nco reaction can not switch an explosive he - burning into a quiescent one in such a way that the co core can grow in mass up to the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "in fact , for low @xmath32 values the energy contribution given by the nco reaction is not able to heat up the bottom of the he - shell , while for higher accretion rates the physical conditions for the e - capture are never reached",
    ".    these considerations are still valid when he - rich matter is accreted as a by - product of a h - burning shell .",
    "in fact , for higher accretion rates ( higher than @xmath55 1 ) the presence of the h - burning shell increases the temperature of underlying he - shell , thus preventing it to become degenerate .",
    "therefore the physical conditions for the ignition of nco chain are never attained ( cassisi , iben & tornamb 1998 ) . on the contrary , for lower accretion rates he and h shells decouple and",
    "the behavior of the models accreting h - rich matter are identical to the models accreting he directly ( piersanti et al.2000 ) .",
