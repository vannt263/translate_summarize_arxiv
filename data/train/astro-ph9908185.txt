    "there is considerable interest in accretion flows which can not lose internal energy through radiative cooling , since they may be relevant to accretion of diffuse plasma onto compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars .",
    "steady - state solutions for the vertically - averaged radial structure of such flows have been developed within the context of self - similarity ( for example , ichimaru 1977 ; begelman & meier 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) assuming angular momentum transport is mediated by an anomalous shear  viscosity \" .",
    "solutions in which the mass accretion rate is constant with radius , and in which most of the gravitational binding energy liberated by accretion is stored as thermal energy ( often called advection dominated accretion flows , or adafs ) have been the focus of many recent studies motivated , for example , by the unusually low high - energy luminosity of some accreting black hole candidates ( narayan et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "there is , however , a long standing question as to whether vertically - averaged solutions are indeed a good representation of the true multidimensional flow .",
    "for example , it is possible that the energy liberated by accretion could drive an outflow in the polar regions which accompanies accretion at the equator ( narayan & yi 1994 ; 1995 ; xu & chen 1997 ) .",
    "if the outflow carries a considerable fraction of the mass , energy , and angular momentum available in the accretion flow , it will have important consequences for the global nature of the solution ( for example , the mass inflow rate at the equator can no longer be constant with radius ) . recently ,",
    "steady - state self - similar adiabatic inflow - outflow solutions ( or  adios \" ) have been developed in generality by blandford & begelman ( 1999a ; 1999b , hereafter bb ) .",
    "spectral models of such solutions have been calculated by quataert & narayan ( 1999 ) . despite the greater generality of the adios models , there remains uncertainty as to how important properties of the outflow such as the mass loss rate and terminal velocity are determined .",
    "outflow from a non - radiative accretion flow will only be captured in a multi - dimensional treatment of the problem ; angle - averaged solutions find only inflow in the inner regions ( ogilvie 1999 ) . in a study of steady flows in thin discs , urpin ( 1983 ; 1984 ) found that accretion at the surfaces of the disc could be accompanied by outflow along the equatorial ( disc ) plane .",
    "gilham ( 1981 ) considered two - dimensional self - similar solutions which were separable in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "his solutions did not contain outflow , but they were also convectively unstable and therefore could not be steady .",
    "an alternative technique for studying multidimensional non - radiative accretion flows is to use numerical methods to solve the time - dependent hydrodynamical equations directly .",
    "with such methods , a variety of problems related to accretion onto black holes have been studied .",
    "for example , the formation of rotationally supported thick tori from inviscid accretion of gas with various initial angular momentum distributions has been reported ( hawley , smarr & wilson 1984a ; 1984b ; hawley 1986 ; see also molteni et al .",
    "1994 ; ryu et al .",
    "1995 ; chen et al .",
    "more recently , an accretion flow driven by an anomalous  viscosity \" around both non - rotating ( igumenshchev et al . 1996 ) and rotating ( igumenshchev & beloborodov 1997 ) black holes has been simulated , revealing a variety of interesting features",
    ". the dynamic range of spatial scales in these latter simulations is too small for a direct comparison of the time - averaged state to the steady - state self - similar solutions discussed above , though more recently these authors have extended their calculations to include a much larger range in radius ( igumenshchev 1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 , hereafter collectively referred to as ia99 ) .",
    "these new calculations reveal that bipolar outflows , strong convection , and quasi - periodic variability can result as the strength of the viscosity is varied .",
    "contemporaneous to the latest work of igumenshchev , we have performed two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) hydrodynamic calculations of non - radiative accretion flows which span over two orders of magnitude in radius .",
    "our calculations begin with a well defined initial equilibrium state : a constant angular momentum  thick \" torus .",
    "because ultimately the accretion is driven by an assumed and _ ad hoc _ shear stress , we study several different forms and a wide range of amplitudes for this stress .",
    "we find that , for the models studied here , the instantaneous flow is dominated by strong small - scale convection in the inner regions .",
    "some of the time - averaged properties of the flow are remarkably independent of the form of the shear stress , at least for the forms adopted here . in every case",
    "we find that at each radius , the mass flux carried inward by convective eddies is nearly exactly balanced by outward motions , so that the net mass _ accretion _ rate is small compared to the local mass _ inflow _ rate . for some forms of the anomalous stress , the regions of inflow and outflow are distributed equally throughout the disc , while for others the outflow occurs preferentially toward the poles , so that on the largest scales the time - averaged flow forms a global circulation pattern of inflow at the equator and slow outflow at the poles .",
    "none of our models show the production of powerful unbound winds .",
    "most importantly , we find the net mass accretion rate through the disc is determined locally by the properties of the flow near the surface of the inner boundary ; it is much smaller than the inflow rate at large radii .",
    "although our calculations have been pursued independently of the work of ia99 , our formulation of the problem is very similar .",
    "in fact we differ only through the use of a different numerical method , a different representation of the shear stress ( see  2.1 ) , and different initial conditions ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "it is likely that the only difference of any importance is the representation of the shear stress .",
    "we compare our approach and results in more detail throughout this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our methods . in  3 we present the results of our hydrodynamical calculations . in ",
    "4 we discuss our results , while in  5 we summarize and conclude .",
    "to compute the models discussed here , we solve the equations of hydrodynamics @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass density , @xmath7 the pressure , @xmath8 the velocity , @xmath9 the internal energy density , and @xmath10 the anomalous stress tensor . the magnitude of the shear stress is determined by the coefficient @xmath11 ; we discuss the forms for @xmath11 used here below .",
    "the @xmath12 denotes the lagrangian time derivative .",
    "a strictly newtonian gravitational potential @xmath13 for a central point mass @xmath14 is used here .",
    "using a pseudo - newtonian potential ( paczyski & wiita 1980 ) to approximate general relativistic effects in the inner regions is in principle straightforward but not of importance to the present investigation .",
    "we adopt an adiabatic equation of state @xmath15 , and consider models with both @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the latter value may provide a better , albeit crude , representation of the dynamics of a radiation dominated fluid ) .",
    "these equations are solved in spherical polar coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "the final term on the rhs of equations 2 and 3 represent anomalous shear stress and heating respectively added to drive angular momentum transport and accretion .",
    "it must be emphasized that the shear stress we wish to approximate is not the result of a true kinematic viscosity . in reality , we expect maxwell stresses associated with mhd turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) to provide angular momentum transport in accretion flows ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "modeling such processes from first principles requires fully three - dimensional mhd calculations : an important and necessary step for future investigations but beyond the scope of this paper . to approximate the effects of magnetic stresses , we assume the azimuthal components of the shear tensor @xmath10 are non - zero and , in spherical polar coordinates ,",
    "are given by @xmath19 @xmath20 this form is similar to the shear stress in a viscous fluid , in which case @xmath21 is the coefficient of shear viscosity , and @xmath0 the kinematic viscosity coefficient .",
    "we emphasize , however , that unlike a viscous fluid , we have assumed the non - azimuthal components of the shear stress are zero , because the mri is driven only by the shear associated with the orbital dynamics , and therefore we do not expect it to affect poloidal shear to the same degree .",
    "local three - dimensional mhd simulations of the properties of the mri in the non - linear regime confirm that the azimuthal components of the maxwell stress are indeed more than an order of magnitude larger than the poloidal components ( e.g. hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ; 1996 ; brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 ; stone et al .",
    "ia99 use a shear stress which has a similar form to equations 4 and 5 , except they also include the poloidal stress terms .",
    "although the local properties of the mri in the nonlinear regime have been well studied , the radial scaling of the maxwell stresses in a global mhd accretion flow is uncertain .",
    "thus , we adopt several empirical forms for @xmath0 to study if and how the flow is changed .",
    "in particular , we consider models with ( 1 ) @xmath22 , ( 2 ) @xmath23 constant , and ( 3 ) @xmath1 .",
    "the first form is adopted primarily as a numerical convenience ; it ensures the stresses are confined mostly to the torus where the density is large .",
    "in fact , as shown below , it results in a flow with constant density in the equatorial plane , which implies the shear stress per unit volume is nearly constant , i.e. it implies the the solutions for the first and second forms of the stress should be similar . the third form for the shear stress corresponds to the expectations of an  @xmath2-disc \" model .",
    "in the last two cases , the stress per volume is independent of all dynamical variables , thus the flow can not adjust itself to change @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we might expect models 2 and 3 to give quite different accretion solutions .",
    "it is important to question whether approximating angular momentum transport in this manner rather than undertaking the requisite mhd calculations is worthwhile . because ",
    "viscous \" non - radiative accretion flows have been so widely discussed in the literature , it is useful to calculate their time - dependent hydrodynamical evolution over a large spatial scale both for comparison to studies of steady - state flows , and to serve as a baseline for future time - dependent mhd calculations . because we find that the time - averaged properties of the flow are remarkably independent of the form of the shear stress , it is possible that some of the results found here will not be qualitatively different in an mhd calculation , provided the angular momentum transport is dominated by internal maxwell stress ( rather than external torques provided by global fields ) .",
    "clearly mhd calculations are warranted to investigate these issues .",
    "our simulations begin with an equilibrium state consisting of a constant angular momentum torus embedded in a non - rotating , low - density ambient medium in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the pressure and density in the torus initially are related through a polytropic equation of state @xmath24 , so that the equilibrium structure of the torus is given by ( papaloizou & pringle 1984 ) @xmath25 .\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is the polytropic index , @xmath27 is the radius of the center ( density maximum ) of the torus , and @xmath28 is a distortion parameter which measures the shape of the cross - sectional area of the torus .",
    "physical solutions to equation 6 require @xmath29 , with values near one giving small , nearly circular cross sections . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose units such that @xmath30 , so that the maximum density is @xmath31 \\right)^{n}.\\ ] ] for given values of @xmath32 , @xmath28 and @xmath33 , equation 7 determines @xmath34 . in most cases we adopt @xmath35 , although in some models we specify the mass contained in the torus instead .",
    "the ambient medium in which the torus is embedded has density @xmath36 and pressure @xmath37 .",
    "the mass and pressure of the ambient medium should be negligibly small ; here we choose @xmath38 so that the ratio of the mass in the ambient medium in @xmath39 to that in the torus @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the ratio of the maximum pressure in the torus to the ambient pressure at @xmath42 is @xmath43 . in order to guarantee an exact numerical equilibrium initially ,",
    "we first initialize the density everywhere , and then integrate the radial equation of motion inwards from the outer boundary to compute the pressure using the numerical difference formula in our hydrodynamics code .",
    "all of the calculations presented here use the zeus-2d code described by stone & norman ( 1992 ) .",
    "no modifications to the code were required , apart from the addition of the shear stress terms .",
    "these terms are updated in an operator split fashion separately from the rest of the dynamical equations .",
    "for stability , these terms must be integrated using a time step which satisfies @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the radial and angular grid spacing , and the minimum is taken over the entire mesh .",
    "whenever this requirement is smaller than the time step used for the hydrodynamic equations , we sub - cycle : that is we integrate the viscous terms repeatedly at the smaller timestep until one hydrodynamical timestep has elapsed .",
    "our computational grid extends from an inner boundary at @xmath47 to @xmath48 . in most simulations ,",
    "we choose @xmath49 , giving a spatial dynamic range over which an accretion flow can be established of two orders of magnitude . in some models we set @xmath50 with the outer boundary at @xmath51",
    ", so that the grid extends nearly three orders of magnitude in radius .",
    "such large dynamic ranges are essential for investigating an accretion flow in the self - similar regime , but are challenging because of the wide range in dynamical ( orbital ) timescales .",
    "for example , for the standard numerical resolution given below , one orbit of evolution at @xmath42 requires 10 - 15 hours on currently available workstations , while calculations at twice the standard resolution take more than 10 times longer .    in order to adequately resolve the flow over such a large spatial scale ,",
    "it is necessary to adopt a non - uniform grid .",
    "we choose a logarithmic grid in which @xmath52{10}$ ] .",
    "this gives a grid in which @xmath53 , with @xmath54 grid points per decade in radius .",
    "similarly , in order to better resolve the flow at the equator , we adopt non - uniform angular zones with @xmath55{4}$ ] for @xmath56 ( that is the zone spacing is decreasing in this region ) , and @xmath57{4}$ ] for @xmath58 .",
    "this gives a refinement by a factor of four in the angular grid zones between the poles and equator .",
    "equatorial symmetry is not assumed .",
    "our standard resolution is @xmath59 and @xmath60 , giving a grid with a total size of @xmath61 zones . we have also computed a high resolution model with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , giving a grid with a total size of @xmath64 zones .",
    "we adopt outflow boundary conditions ( projection of all dynamical variables ) at both the inner and outer radial boundaries .",
    "we further set @xmath65 at the inner radial boundary . in the angular direction ,",
    "the boundary conditions are set by symmetry at the poles ( including setting @xmath66 ) .",
    "in some numerical simulations , numerical transport of angular momentum can limit the accuracy of the results .",
    "in fact , the consistent transport algorithms implemented in the zeus-2d code ( stone & norman 1992 ) are specifically designed to reduce this effect . as a test",
    ", we have evolved a torus with @xmath67 for 2 orbits at @xmath42 .",
    "apart from a slight smoothing of the sharp edges of the torus over 2 - 3 grid zones , we find no evolution .",
    "the angular momentum of the torus is conserved to one part in @xmath68 , and the total rotational kinetic energy to one part in @xmath69 .",
    "we have also tested our implementation of the shear stress terms by comparing the evolution of the angle - integrated surface density at early times with the exact analytic solution for a thin viscous torus ( e.g. figure 1 of pringle 1981 ) .",
    "we find excellent correspondence between our numerical and the analytic solution up to a time of roughly 0.8 orbits , beyond which effects associated with the multidimensional nature of the flow in our simulations begin to become important .",

    "initially , the evolution is as predicted ( pringle 1981 ) : most of the mass loses angular momentum and falls inward forming a wedge - shaped structure , while a small fraction of the mass gains angular momentum and moves outward .",
    "in fact , as indicated by the shading , the surface layers of the inner regions actually move outward  they form a kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) roll at the surface of the torus by @xmath75 .",
    "by @xmath76 material has begun to accrete through the inner boundary , while outflow along the surface of the torus has carried the first k - h roll out to @xmath77 , and a second roll - up is forming at @xmath78 .",
    "thereafter , the central wedge - shaped flow thickens considerably , so that by the end of the calculation the density contours in the inner regions are nearly radial .",
    "the wiggles in the contours in this region are caused by large amplitude density fluctuations in the flow associated with strong convective motions occurring at small radii .",
    "this convection drives a low - velocity outflow from the inner regions , in fact , all the material located at angles @xmath79 degrees from the equator is outflowing .",
    "this flow remains bound , however , so that it eventually cascades back onto the surface of the torus and merges with it in the outer regions .",

    "in particular , the outflowing material is still bound , and has the same total energy as in run a , and therefore stagnates at roughly the same radial position as the flow shown in the last panel of fig .",
    "1 . making the inner boundary smaller does not lead to the production of a more energetic outflow .",
    "of course , varying the location of the inner boundary is equivalent to moving the initial location of the torus either closer to or farther from the central point mass . since most of the gravitational energy is liberated near the central object , we should not expect substantial changes in the flow if the torus starts at @xmath142 as opposed to @xmath143 , as is indeed observed .",
    "we have studied the direction of the time - averaged advective flux of mass , energy , and angular momentum , and the flux of @xmath97 transported by shear stresses in run b. we find the first three are nearly identical , thus in figure 8 we show a vector plot of only @xmath144 for the same 139 data files as used to construct figs .",
    "4 - 7 . to further reduce the noise in the data",
    ", we have averaged together the fluxes on either side of the equator .",
    "even so , the direction of the inflow does not form smooth streamlines .",
    "overall , there is a quasi - radial inflow within @xmath145 degrees , and a more nearly radial outflow above that ( although , consistent with the profile of the time - averaged angular velocities mentioned above , the mass flux vectors are more polar than equatorial ) .",
    "note from fig .",
    "8 that one could also use the change in sign of the radial component of the average mass flux vectors to crudely define a surface to the disc at @xmath145 degrees . although not plotted , the viscous flux of angular momentum is radial within the inflowing regions , and away from the poles in the outflow .",
    "( 252,180 ) ( 0,0 )    the accretion flow which emerges from these calculations must be driven by angular momentum transport associated with the anomalous shear stress .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by setting the shear stress to zero once the mass accretion rate has reached a steady - state .",
    "when run a is continued for another orbit with @xmath67 , the mass accretion rate drops by an order of magnitude within 0.1 orbits , the convective motions die away , and the torus settles into a new two - dimensional hydrostatic equilibrium with a nearly keplerian rotation profile near the equator .",
    "it can also be demonstrated that the thermal heating due to the anomalous shear stress plays a fundamental role in producing convection and mass outflow .",
    "if we repeat the fiducial model with the heating term ( last term in equation 3 ) removed , we find a high - velocity , ordered infall is produced with no small - scale convective motions .",
    "we have studied the effect of varying the adiabatic index @xmath71 on the properties of the flow .",
    "run e listed in table  1 has @xmath146 , but otherwise is identical to the fiducial model run a ( a different value of @xmath34 must be chosen in order to keep @xmath40 fixed  this increases the maximum initial density in the torus ) .",
    "we find that apart from being slightly more compact in the equatorial plane ( the opening angle of the accretion being closer to 30 degrees ) the detailed properties of the solution ( for instance the radial scaling of time - averaged variables ) do not change significantly compared to run a. the rotational velocity is still very nearly keplerian , and @xmath103 and @xmath106 .",
    "most significantly , we still find @xmath147 in this simulation . the mass accretion rate through the inner boundary listed in table  1 is increased in run e compared to a",
    "; it is a small fraction of @xmath148 and is consistent with the local , viscous accretion rate at the inner boundary .    finally , to study the effect of the shape of the initial torus , we have computed two models with @xmath149 , one with @xmath109 ( run f ) and one with @xmath146 ( run g ) .",
    "once again , @xmath40 is kept fixed between these models by choosing an appropriate value for @xmath34 .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath28 used in these models gives the torus in the initial state a cross - sectional diameter about one half the value in run a. we find no qualitative change in the solution compared to run a. in particular , the outflow is driven to the same radial position ( but no farther ) , indicating that the initial thermal energy is not important in the outflow . in both cases , the flow is dominated by convection in the inner regions , with time - averaged radial profiles for each variable that obey the same radial scalings as found for run a. the @xmath109 ( run f ) model has a steady - state mass accretion rate identical to run a , while in the @xmath146 ( run g ) model the accretion rate is increased by the same amount as run e.      we have calculated the evolution of two models in which @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( i.e. , the shear stress is either ten times smaller or larger than in the fiducial model respectively ) .",
    "these models are labeled as runs h and i in table 1 .",
    "each model is computed at the standard resolution of 64 grid points per decade in radius .",
    "together with run a , they form a set of models which span two orders of magnitude in amplitude of the anomalous shear stress .    at low values of the shear stress ( run h ) ,",
    "the evolution to a steady accretion flow proceeds much more slowly than in the fiducial model , as one would expect .",
    "thus , it takes roughly 20 orbits of the torus for @xmath82 to converge to a steady value .",
    "this value ( final column in table 1 ) is roughly fifteen times smaller than run a , although for a viscous disc one expects the mass accretion rate to be directly proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the density at the equator is about 2/3 the value in run a. the two - dimensional structure of the time - averaged flow in run h is very similar to that shown in figure 4 for run a. the radial scaling of all variables near the equator also follow the results of run a closely , i.e. @xmath152 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath153 at @xmath27 , slightly smaller than run a. once again , the inner regions of the flow are dominated by convective motions which drive a significant outward mass flux that carries away most of the energy liberated by accretion .",
    "the mass inflow rate once again scales as @xmath147 .    at high values of the shear stress ( run i ) ,",
    "the evolution of the torus becomes very dynamic .",
    "in fact , the initial infall of material from the torus becomes nearly supersonic , reaching the rotation axis after only 0.15 orbits .",
    "this rapid infall creates a high pressure as material reflects off the rotation axis , resulting in the ejection of some matter along the poles .",
    "convective motions begin within @xmath89 after 0.2 orbits , at which point the flow attempts to settle into the same equatorial - inflow polar - outflow solution observed in run a. however , the mass accretion rate is marked by large amplitude fluctuations throughout the evolution of run i , leading to a time - averaged value only 3 times larger than run a. the time - averaged radial scaling of all variables shows the same dependences on @xmath99 for all variables as observed in run a for @xmath154 , however for @xmath89 some variables diverge from simple power - law behavior .",
    "for example , both the rotational and radial velocity becomes flat for @xmath155 . at the inner edge , the ratio of @xmath156 , and @xmath157 ( note for run a this latter ratio @xmath158 ) .",
    "these ratios indicate the flow has deviated from strictly keplerian rotation , and that radial pressure gradients are playing an important role in the radial structure of the flow . despite the fact that the flow at such large values of the shear stress ( the  effective-@xmath2 \" of run i at the inner boundary is @xmath159 ) is qualitatively different in the inner regions compared to the fiducial model , we still observe very low mass accretion rates through the inner boundary compared to the mass inflow rate at large radii @xmath148 .",
    "because the violent initial collapse of the torus may be interfering with the establishment of a steady accretion flow , we have also calculated a model which begins from the final state of run a , but with a shear stress which is slowly increased until @xmath160 .",
    "that is , starting from time 4.325 in run a , the model is evolved for roughly one orbit with @xmath161 , one orbit with @xmath162 , and finally one orbit with @xmath160 .",
    "the final time - averaged mass accretion rate in the model ( run i@xmath163 ) given in table 1 is only a factor of 2.4 larger than the initial accretion rate measured in run a. in fact , almost no change in the accretion rate is observed after the final increase in @xmath0 , indicating that the mass accretion rate is limited at large values of the stress .",
    "the radial profiles of each variable in run i@xmath163 follow power laws over a wider range in radii , with @xmath81 and @xmath131 becoming flat only over @xmath164 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath165 at the inner edge , while @xmath166 .",
    "the flow in run i@xmath163 is again marked by large amplitude fluctuations in the mass accretion rate .",
    "thus , we conclude that at high values of the shear stress , the flow deviates from a rotationally supported disc due to radial pressure support .",
    "however , we emphasize that strong mass outflow and convection are still important .",
    "finally , we note that ia99 have also studied the effect of varying the amplitude of the shear stress on non - radiative accretion flows . at low values of @xmath0 ,",
    "they find strong , small - scale convective eddies dominate the flow , in accordance with the results presented here . at large @xmath0 ( much larger than the largest value we have studied here )",
    ", they find the flow becomes more laminar , and produces a bipolar outflow structure .",
    "qualitatively , our results are in agreement , although there is an indication of stronger convection in our solutions at large @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible that the poloidal shear stress used by ia99 may partially suppress convection in this case .",
    "the last two models listed in table 1 have been computed with entirely different forms for the anomalous shear stress than runs a through i discussed above .",
    "run j uses a spatially constant stress , whereas run k uses a stress proportional to @xmath167 . in both models ,",
    "the amplitude is normalized to give roughly the same stress at @xmath27 as in run a ( about @xmath168 since @xmath169 at late times ) .",
    "we use runs j and k to investigate the effect of changing the form ( rather than amplitude ) of the stress on the resulting flow .",
    "since , once a steady - state is achieved in the inner regions , the accretion flow in which @xmath22 has constant density along the equatorial plane ( leading to a constant shear stress with radius ) , we expect the flow in run j to be similar to run a. indeed , we find that in run j the mass accretion rate eventually saturates at approximately the same value as run a. the flow is once again dominated by large amplitude convection motions in the inner regions .",
    "most importantly , the time - averaged two dimensional and radial structure of the flow is similar to that found in run a. in particular , we again find @xmath103 , @xmath170 , and @xmath147 , while the ratio @xmath171 at @xmath172 . perhaps the only significance of this result is that although the shear stress in the outflowing material is greatly increased in run j compared to run a ( because of the variation in density with @xmath129 ) the details of the inflow - outflow solution have not been affected . both the same amplitude for the mass accretion rate and the same radial scaling of the time - averaged solution are obtained .    in run",
    "k the shear stress is given a fixed radial scaling which differs from the profile of the stress eventually established in runs a and j ; thus we might expect a quite different flow pattern to result .",
    "the mass accretion rate eventually saturates in run k after 10 orbits at a value consistent with run a. figure 9 plots two - dimensional contours of time - averaged variables in run k constructed from 33 equally spaced data files between orbits 12.0 and 13.6 .",
    "the general shape of the contours ( from concave to convex with respect to an outward norm at the equator ) follows the same pattern as observed in run b ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in particular",
    ", the systematic trend in the shapes indicates that once again , strong convection drives the time - averaged flow into a marginally stable state .",
    "however , there are important differences in the solution ; in particular the density at the midplane is now clearly decreasing with radius , while the bernoulli function is negative over nearly the entire domain .",
    "the instantaneous structure of each variable at any time after the flow has reached a steady accretion rate is close to that shown in figure 3 for run b  namely large amplitude fluctuations around the mean values shown in figure 9 associated with strong convection .",

    "6 ) : here @xmath177 roughly .",
    "the net mass accretion rate @xmath82 is remarkably constant throughout the flow , and has a value consistent with the viscous accretion rate for the properties of the flow near the inner boundary .",

    "7 , the rotational velocity @xmath131 is nearly constant with @xmath129 at every radial position , so that @xmath97 varies as @xmath178 .",
    "note that the profile at @xmath130 ( solid line each panel ) may be affected by numerical resolution near the poles : run k is computed at only half the resolution of run b. comparison of the structure of the solution in runs a and b ( the same model computed at different resolutions ) indicate that within @xmath130 material can fill in the gap near the poles in the lower resolution simulations .",
    "the radial and angular profiles of @xmath81 and @xmath135 indicate there is no global circulation pattern in run k , instead inflow and outflow are evenly distributed throughout the disc . in this respect , the flow is closer in analogy to a rapidly rotating star than an accretion disc , in that thermal energy is produced deep in the interior and is convected outwards at all angles .",
    "( 504,360 ) ( 0,0 )",
    "our major finding is that , independent of the equation of state of the gas , and independent of the magnitude and functional form of the shear stress , the angle - integrated mass inflow rate strongly increases with radius , @xmath147 for runs a - j , and @xmath177 for run k. in every case , the mass inflow is balanced by a nearly equal mass outflow , so that the actual accretion rate onto the central object @xmath179 is only a fraction of the canonical accretion rate @xmath180 which should be generated by the torus at radius @xmath181 for the given shear stress , @xmath182 where @xmath183",

    "the net mass accretion rate through the flow is constant with radius ( as it must be for a steady state ) and is consistent with the local viscous accretion rate given by the properties of the flow near the inner boundary .",
    "although this result is independent of the nature of the shear stress , the detailed properties of the solution do in fact change according to the functional form of the stress .",
    "for example , models in which the shear stress per unit volume @xmath0 is constant give @xmath103 and @xmath106 , whereas models in which @xmath1 give @xmath186 and @xmath175 .",
    "in fact , these scalings can be understood directly from the equations of motion , using the known properties of the solutions .",
    "for example , using the fact that the time - averaged rotational velocity is nearly keplerian ( @xmath187 ) and symmetric across the equatorial plane , the @xmath188-component of the momentum equation in spherical polar coordinates can be written ( assuming steady state ) as @xmath189 for this equation to hold over many orders of magnitude in radius , all terms must scale with @xmath99 in the same way .",
    "thus , one sees immediately that for @xmath190 constant , @xmath106 , whereas for @xmath191 , @xmath175 .",
    "as discussed in  3 , the solutions computed here also fit the condition that the time - averaged bernoulli function @xmath98 is approximately zero in the equatorial plane . for nearly keplerian rotation with negligible polar velocities",
    ", this implies @xmath192 ( equation 9 ) . using this condition in the energy equation , combined with the continuity equation and the angular momentum equation given above , it is possible to predict not only the radial scalings , but also the amplitudes of the flow variables .",
    "we find such predictions are only within a factor of a few of the measured time - averaged flow variables plotted in figs . 5 and 10 .",
    "it is possible this discrepancy arises because of the difference between constructing nonlinear functions of time - averaged variables versus the time - average of the functions themselves .    because almost all of the inflowing material at any particular radius in the flow is balanced by a nearly equal and opposite outflow which carries away the energy liberated by accretion , the solutions found here may be considered as the  maximally inefficient \" accretion solution , one limit of the adios solutions discussed by bb .",
    "we emphasize , however , that we do not see powerful , unbound winds in our flows , rather only slow , outflow associated with convective eddies .",
    "our flows are inefficient because vigorous convection in the flow quickly equalizes the specific entropy of all the gas , thus in order for a small fraction of the gas to lose energy and accrete inwards , a large fraction must carry off that energy in a slow outflow",
    ". there may be some physical effects ( such as torques from strong magnetic fields ) that can drive much faster outflows that have a much higher specific energy . in this case",
    ", it is possible that a smaller fraction of the inflowing material will be lost to the outflow , and therefore @xmath118 may not be as steep as @xmath99 ( bb ) .",
    "equally important , magnetic fields will regulate angular momentum transport through the magnetorotational instability , and thus in mhd the gas does not require an _",
    "ad hoc _ anomalous shear stress to accrete .",
    "fully mhd calculations that can capture both of these effects are underway .",
    "besides the neglect of magnetic fields , our solutions may also be limited by the assumption of axisymmetry . in a fully three - dimensional flow , angular momentum",
    "can be carried outwards by global waves ( for example , our initial state is unstable to a non - axisymmetric global instability , papaloizou & pringle 1984 ) , and perhaps through the action of radial convection .",
    "however , we do not expect these effects to change the qualitative nature of the axisymmetric solutions found here .",
    "fully three - dimensional simulations are also underway to test this expectation .    of course",
    ", having @xmath147 has important implications for the observations of accreting compact objects ( bb ; quataert & narayan 1999 )  the apparent lack of high - energy emission from such objects may be a result of the vanishingly small accretion rate in the inner regions .",
    "it is equally interesting to determine the long term evolution of matter accreting onto compact objects through the non - radiative accretion flow solutions presented here .",
    "the ultimate fate of the outflowing material depends on whether it is able to cool at large radii and thereby rejoin the accretion flow ( except for the small fraction needed to carry away the angular momentum ) .",
    "it is feasible that such a recycling process may lead to an increase in the density in the inflowing material .",
    "potentially , this can lead to an increase in the radiative efficiency , and could make the flow transition to a thin disc with a much larger accretion rate .",
    "most of the mass accreted by the central object may be accumulated through such episodic bursts of accretion .",
    "we must express a strong word of caution at this point , however .",
    "we have presented solutions over two orders of magnitude in radius for at most twenty orbits of the outer regions .",
    "such evolutionary effects will require understanding the solutions over five or more orders of magnitude in radius for thousands of orbits of the outer regions .",
    "we have investigated the properties of non - radiative rotating accretion flows by carrying out a set of numerical two - dimensional ( axially symmetric ) hydrodynamical experiments using a simple starting configuration and a set of well - defined boundary conditions .",
    "we start with all the mass rotating in a torus in hydrodynamic equilibrium at radius @xmath193 .",
    "we allow small ( in the sense that the induced flow velocities are small compared to the rotational velocities ) anomalous shear stresses to act on the flow .",
    "we set a purely accreting inner boundary at ( for most of our models ) a radius of @xmath194 . all energy deposited in the fluid by shear stresses",
    "is retained by the fluid , and not radiated .",
    "a spherical polar grid with logarithmically spaced zones is used to resolve the flow over more than two decades in radius .",
    "we find that in the inner regions , the flow becomes strongly convective , and in fact convective motions dominate the instantaneous structure of the flow .",
    "this convection produces outward moving fluid elements ( with high entropy , low density , and an excess of angular momentum compared to rotation at the local keplerian value ) at all angles , including near the equator .",
    "the outflowing material removes mass , angular momentum , and most importantly energy from the accretion flow .",
    "however , the strong convection combined with diffusion on small scales mixes the specific entropy of the fluid very efficiently , which means that a very large mass loss rate is required to remove enough energy to allow some fluid to accrete .    despite the strong time - dependence of the solution ,",
    "long time - averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable correspondence to steady - state solutions .",
    "two - dimensional contours indicate the time - averaged flow is marginally stable to the hiland criterion .",
    "radial profiles of the variables are all power - laws over nearly the entire domain .",
    "the rotation profiles are always nearly keplerian ( except for very large values of the shear stress when , in the inner regions , pressure gradients become substantial ) .",
    "perhaps the most important result of this study is that the mass accretion rate through the inner boundary is a small fraction of the angle - integrated mass inflow rate at large radii .",
    "the net mass accretion rate through the disc is consistent with the viscous accretion rate appropriate to the conditions in the flow at the surface of the central object .",
    "most of the inflowing mass at large radii eventually becomes part of the outflow driven by convection .",
    "this result is independent of the adiabatic index of the gas , or the magnitude or form of the anomalous shear stress .",
    "qualitatively , our results are in agreement with those of igumenshchev ( 1999 ) , who has undertaken a similar study using different numerical methods , for low values of the shear stress .",
    "if confirmed by more realistic three - dimensional and mhd calculations , this result has important implications both for the spectrum and luminosity of accreting compact objects , and the long term evolution of accretion flows .    * acknowledgments : * we thank roger blandford for many stimulating discussions and comments on earlier drafts of this paper , and an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions . js",

    "<S> a spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders of magnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatial scales . </S>",
    "<S> we find that convection in the inner regions produces significant outward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by , and a large fraction of the mass participating in , the accretion flow . </S>",
    "<S> although the instantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convective eddies , long time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable correspondence to certain steady - state solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional structure of the time - averaged flow is marginally stable to the hiland criterion , indicating that convection is efficient . </S>",
    "<S> near the equatorial plane , the radial profiles of the time - averaged variables are power - laws with an index that depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress . </S>",
    "<S> a stress in which @xmath1 recovers the widely studied self - similar solution corresponding to an  @xmath2-disc \" . </S>",
    "<S> we find that regardless of the adiabatic index of the gas , or the form or magnitude of the shear stress , the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius , and is everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the net mass accretion rate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is supplied to the inflow at large radii , and is given by the local , viscous accretion rate associated with the flow properties near the central object .    </S>",
