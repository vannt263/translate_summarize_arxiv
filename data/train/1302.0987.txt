    "most of the mechanical properties of crystals depend crucially on the presence of crystalline defects . for material processing",
    "it is therefore of principal importance to understand and control the defect concentration and dynamics .",
    "the nature and dynamics of defects is much easier to classify for crystalline sheets in two spatial dimensions . in this case , it is known for a long time , that the formation and unbinding of topological defects provides an efficient way of melting according to the two - stage scenario proposed by kosterlitz - thouless - nelson - halperin - young ( ktnhy ) @xcite .",
    "defects can also be accumulated near edges of crystalline sheets and do occur for two - dimensional crystals on more complicated manifolds @xcite .",
    "defects are highly dynamic : whereas the structure of a crystal is static over long time scales , defects undergo diffusion in the crystalline background .",
    "the diffusive dynamics of individual point defects were observed directly in two - dimensional colloidal suspensions of charged micro - spheres by video microscopy @xcite and they were confirmed and further analyzed by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of defects were also explored by real - space methods in a two - dimensional crystal of weakly damped dust particles in a plasma by nosenko and coworkers @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "describing the defect dynamics by a microscopic theory is still a formidable challenge , in particular close to melting .",
    "such a theory should contain the solid and fluid phase and give a reliable picture on the defect concentration and its dynamics .",
    "recent progress in this respect has been made by classical density functional approaches of freezing @xcite . for brownian particles ,",
    "the density functional approach can be generalized towards dynamics @xcite and the dynamics of solidification has been examined in two dimensions @xcite . similar in line , a more coarse - grained phase - field - crystal model has been proposed to describe crystal growth @xcite and the defect structure and dynamics , for various applications see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however a systematic exploration of defect dynamics by such a density functional theory has not yet been performed nor has the reliability of the phase - field - crystal model been systematically checked as far as the trends of defect dynamics are concerned .    here",
    ", we study the dynamics of vacancies in a two - dimensional colloidal crystal by using brownian dynamics computer simulations , dynamical density functional theory and the phase - field crystal approach and thereby test the ability of the theoretical approaches to qualitatively reproduce the observations made in the simulations .",
    "the model system we use here is a two - dimensional suspension of dipolar colloids . this system has been realized experimentally as superparamagnetic particles at an air - water interface @xcite .",
    "when exposing superparamagnetic particles to an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane , their induced magnetic dipole moment leads to an effective repulsive interaction whose amplitude can be tuned by the magnetic field strength . at sufficiently high field strength ,",
    "the system crystallizes into a two - dimensional triangular ( i.e.  hexagonal ) crystal .",
    "this system has been studied extensively by computer simulations and by the aforementioned dynamical density functional theory @xcite and phase field crystal models @xcite .    out of a perfect triangular crystal ,",
    "some particles are removed and the relaxation of the resulting defect and its mobility are extracted by monitoring the one - particle density as a function of time .",
    "we confirm by simulation that the defect mobility is increasing with increasing temperature , as was already observed for charged particles by lbal _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively and semi - quantitatively reproduced in dynamical density functional theory based on a static ramakrishnan - yussouff - like density functional @xcite .",
    "the phase - field - crystal model , on the other hand , fails to predict the trend of the temperature - dependence of the mobilities .",
    "this is mainly attributed to the constant kinetic prefactor involved in the phase - field - crystal approach . for predicting the trend ,",

    "the integrated density field over one wigner - seitz cell is equal to the probability to find a particle at the corresponding lattice site . in the approximation to the density functional theory by ramakrishnan and yussouff for magnetic dipoles in 2d described above this number is very close to @xmath39 .",

    ", we are here concerned with the long - time dynamics of vacancies . for ease of computation and to assess larger time scales we thus start with a slightly different setup , as compared to the setup in the computer simulations : instead of introducing a vacancy with probability @xmath39 at the center of a large two - dimensional crystal , which constitutes a problem of cylindrical symmetry , we study the relaxation dynamics of the quasi - one - dimensional setup sketched in fig .",

    "the pfc1 model gives the same incorrect trend as the pfc2 models .",
    "again , after a transient process the system reaches a state where the relaxation towards equilibrium is getting diffusive but the slope increases with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the physical reason for the incorrect trend in both variants of pfc models is that the pfc has a smoothened density profile and therefore allows for a quick diffusive current of particles from one lattice site to another . in ddft , on the other hand , the full density profile is kept and the density decays to very small values in the interstitial region between the density peaks .",
    "thus , particle currents between lattice sites are strongly reduced .",
    "for increasing coupling @xmath28 , the interstitial density drops even further down and therefore reduces vacancy diffusion more .",
    "this effect is not contained in both pfc models . here",
    "rather the only remaining trend is set by the increasing interactions which leads to larger inter - particle forces and therefore accelerate the dynamics of vacancy diffusion .",
    "therefore , to account for the correct defect dynamics , the temperature dependence of the mobility prefactor in the pfc models needs a proper fitting to reference data .",
    "though this reduces the predictive power of the pfc model , it may still be useful for a fast explorative numerical study for various dynamical effects in solids provided this fitting is before a priori .",
    "in conclusion , we have used dynamical density functional theory , phase - field - crystal theory and particle - resolved brownian dynamics computer simulations to calculate the diffusion of defects in a two - dimensional crystal of repulsive dipoles .",
    "the typical diffusion coefficient of defect motion is expected to decrease with increasing system temperature as confirmed by the simulation data .",
    "this trend is reproduced in the dynamical density functional theory but not in the phase field crystal calculations .",
    "these findings show that the pfc model requires a fitting of the kinetic mobilities as a function of the thermodynamic parameters if a realistic description of trends is required to predict material properties .",
    "given the fact that the efficiency of the pfc model is in general achieved by an optimal fitting procedure , also for structural predictions @xcite , such a phenomenological input of the mobility is an acceptable fact .",
    "however , it shows that clearly the dynamical density functional theory is more appropriate to predict the microscopic time evolution as a first - principle theory for brownian systems .",
    "future work should address the dynamics of dipolar mixtures of colloidal particles with different dipole moments @xcite where an equilibrium density functional for a binary mixture @xcite is needed .",
    "these mixtures show more complex possibilities of mixed crystals as a function of the asymmetry in their dipole moments @xcite . in this case",
    "one will expect different diffusion coefficients for different defects topologies .",
    "moreover , one should do a similar calculation for hard discs , for which a very accurate functional based on fundamental measure theory @xcite was proposed recently @xcite .",
    "a similar comparison can be performed in three dimensions , e.g.  for hard spheres , where the phase field crystal model has been tested against density functional theory recently @xcite .",
    "finally it would be interesting to consider particles with orientational degrees of freedom which form liquid crystals with interesting defect structures .",
    "in fact , phase - field - crystal models for liquid crystals have been developed @xcite and applied @xcite to freezing recently which opens the way to describe defect dynamics in liquid crystalline states .",
