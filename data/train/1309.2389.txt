    "in systems in which the formation of the equilibrium crystalline phase is easily evaded , and a glass forms without rapid cooling , the liquid - glass transition can usefully be viewed as a thermodynamic transition .",
    "the order parameter that distinguishes a glass from a liquid , as established many years ago @xcite by analogy with the case of a spin glass , is the time - persistent part of the density auto - correlation function .",
    "the corresponding susceptibility which measures correlations of glassiness must involve four densities @xcite .",
    "an intense search using such higher order correlators has established in theories @xcite , `` equilibrium '' experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite , the existence of a dynamic length scale that grows upon approaching the glass transition . in conventional critical phenomena",
    "a single diverging correlation length governs the critical - point singularities in various quantities such as order parameter , susceptibility and specific heat @xcite . for glass ,",
    "several length scales have been defined @xcite whose inter - relations or independence are a subject of active discussion @xcite .",
    "our analysis in this paper concerns the extension of the dynamic length scale , extracted from three- or four - density correlators , to the non - stationary regime following quench . by",
    "_ equilibrium _ in this paper , we mean without a quench .",
    "we shall assume we are working with good glass formers that display a glass transition independent of cooling rate .",
    "if we treat glass as a phase , with an order parameter , we can then ask how glassiness grows following a quench .",
    "the theory of the domain growth of an ordered phase after sudden quench from the disordered phase is one of the landmark achievements of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "analogously , if there exists a length scale describing the spatial extent of glassy correlations , it too must grow as one waits longer in the final quenched state .",
    "the issue for glass was first explored by parisi in the context of a monte carlo simulation of a binary mixture of soft spheres @xcite .",
    "such a growth of a length scale was also found , by parsaeian _",
    "et al _ @xcite in their study of the domain growth dynamics of glassy order within the molecular dynamics simulation of a binary lennard - jones system .",
    "however , a detailed theoretical understanding of these findings , that is , a theory of the growth kinetics of a glass , has emerged only recently @xcite , in an mct framework .",
    "aging in structural glasses has been investigated through the study of the two - point correlator in experiments @xcite , simulations @xcite , within mode - coupling theories @xcite and within random first order transition ( rfot ) theory @xcite .",
    "related studies for spin glasses include @xcite .",
    "franz and hertz @xcite showed that the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the amit - roginsky @xmath13 model @xcite contains the aging dynamics observed in structural glasses and in many spin glasses .",
    "mode - coupling theory ( mct ) has been remarkably successful in describing glassy dynamics , notwithstanding the fact that the `` mct glass transition '' to a non - ergodic state is ultimately avoided in real systems as a result of activated processes .",
    "taking the input of the static structure factor alone , mct offers parameter - free predictions of the dynamics and growth of relaxation time of dense liquids at equilibrium .",
    "therefore , it becomes imperative to extend mct to the case of an aging system as the first step towards a theory of the coarsening of glassiness .",
    "however , obtaining the equations of motion for the aging regime poses challenges , as time translation invariance is lost .",
    "most conventional approaches @xcite to derive mct use the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) at some point , explicitly or implicitly . the field - theoretical technique @xcite is especially well suited for this purpose as it does not assume the fdr .",
    "we use this technique to obtain the final equations for correlation and response functions starting with the hydrodynamic equations of motion .",
    "the problem of satisfying the equilibrium fdr within this approach at one - loop order has been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "but we are interested in the schematic version of the theory , within which there is no problem .",
    "moreover , if we impose fdr by hand on the final equations , we find they reproduce the equilibrium results .    as the theoretical system size is infinite , the dynamics following a quench in our theory will be characterized by a correlation length and total susceptibility that will grow forever , as is familiar from the domain growth of a conventional ordered phase @xcite .",
    "within our calculation , of course , the phase in question is the `` mct glass '' .",
    "however , if we apply a small shear on the system , it will reach a steady state as the waiting time becomes of the order of the inverse shear rate .",
    "thus the dynamic length scale in glassy system under shear is restricted by the imposed shear rate . within mct , shear has two primary effects on the system : ( i ) it reduces the height of the static structure factor , which becomes anisotropic under shear @xcite and ( ii ) due to advection of wave vector , the strength of the memory kernel diminishes when the time scale becomes of the order of the waiting time @xcite . in principle , both the contributions should be taken into account .",
    "however , the first contribution makes a numerical solution of the final equations exceedingly difficult , since anisotropy increases the number of variables to be evaluated and the solution becomes hugely time consuming .",
    "we render the problem tractable by making an isotropic approximation @xcite within which only the reduction in the memory kernel enters .",
    "the natural quantity to look at in order to obtain the information about a length scale is a certain four - point correlation function @xcite because , as we remarked , the order - parameter is a two - point quantity ; however , it has been demonstrated for the equilibrium case @xcite that certain three - point correlation functions contain similar information @xcite , and are tractable to evaluate . in practice , as was done in @xcite , we obtain the desired quantity through a suitably defined susceptibility .",
    "the main results of this work are as follows :    1 .",
    "if the quench is from the liquid state to deep in glassy regime , the peak value @xmath14 of @xmath0 , which has the interpretation of a correlation volume , grows without bound as we wait longer in the final state ( fig .",
    "[ largelambda ] ) whereas this growth saturates when the quench is to liquid side ( fig .",
    "[ lowlambda ] ) .",
    "the correlation volume , @xmath14 grows as @xmath4 and the relaxation time @xmath15 , defined as the time when @xmath0 attains its peak , goes as @xmath5 when the quench is to glassy regime ( fig .",
    "[ scaling_fit ] and fig .",

    "these results rationalize the numerical experiments on domain growth @xcite and aging @xcite .",
    "3 .   if the quench is to a temperature still on the liquid side , the growth saturates for @xmath2 beyond the equilibrium relaxation time @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting finite value @xmath3 of the correlation volume goes as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance from the critical point , and as @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ ss_chi3scaling ] ) when expressed in terms of the relaxation time .",
    "these results are in agreement with existing theories @xcite and simulations @xcite in their appropriate limits .",
    "4 .   from the two - point function",
    "@xmath19 we can extract a relaxation time @xmath11 where @xmath19 becomes @xmath20 .",
    "if we scale time by @xmath11 , @xmath19 shows data collapse as is expected for `` simple aging '' ( inset of fig .",
    "[ correlationfn ] ) .",
    "however , no such data collapse is seen when @xmath0 is scaled with @xmath3 and time with @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ scaling_fit ] ) .",
    "this suggests that describing an aging system in terms of an evolving effective temperature misses some essential physics .",
