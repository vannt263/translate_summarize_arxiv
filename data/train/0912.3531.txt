    "hence , the time - evolution of a dissipative quantum spin can be formulated as that of a classical spin in a random magnetic field .",
    "the quantum nature of the problem is hidden in the fact that spin rotations about different axes do not commute and through the averaging over random field configurations .",
    "to prove the feasibility of our method , we have computed the spin dynamics for zero detuning in the range @xmath131 for different temperatures @xmath25 .",

    "note that the statistical error of our method scales like @xmath139 , where @xmath119 is the number of different realizations of the noise .",
    "we thus can not resolve the existence of a small incoherent part at weak - coupling @xmath140 , which was predicted in ref .   using a rigorous born approximation .        for increasing temperature ,",

    "next , we turn to the case of a landau - zener sweep of the detuning @xmath144 with @xmath8 .",
    "we examine the survival probability @xmath1 that the spin remains in its initial state if swept across the resonance . neglecting the bath ,",
    "this problem can be solved exactly  @xcite and one finds that @xmath1 converges toward the celebrated landau - zener formula @xmath145 $ ] for @xmath146 .",
    "a fundamental question is thus how this result is modified in the presence of dissipation .",
    "surprisingly , at zero temperature the bath does not affect the final transition probability @xmath147 in the limit @xmath3 , if the spin couples longitudinally to the reservoir via its @xmath148 component  @xcite .",
    "this limit , however , corresponds to very large times @xmath149 where the separation of the spin energies is larger than the bosonic bandwidth .",
    "in contrast , we explore the so - called _ scaling _ regime , where one first takes the limit @xmath150 , holding @xmath151 fixed , and only then considers @xmath152 .",
    "this limit is important because it allows the spin - boson model to exhibit universal behavior  @xcite . for large but finite @xmath5",
    "the scaling regime corresponds to an _ intermediate time regime _ where the spin energy separation @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath5 but possibly much larger than @xmath6 : @xmath153 .",
    "phonon assisted spin transitions therefore still occur even though @xmath154 , and the probability @xmath1 converges toward its final value @xmath147 only for times of the order @xmath155 .",
    "note that this is in stark contrast to the non - dissipative ( perfectly isolated ) case where this convergence happens much faster for @xmath156 . in the context of landau - zener transitions ,",
    "the bath preparation affects the long - time result of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to consider the contribution of the initial sojourn exactly , as it accounts for the fact that the bath starts out from a shifted equilibrium state .",
    "it is given by the @xmath157 terms in @xmath158 ( eq .  ) .",
    "we can incorporate this term by adding it to the height function @xmath159\\ , .",

    "we set @xmath168 in an individual run since @xmath169 only accounts for the contribution of paths with at least one spin jump . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , the evolution is not unitary .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ]  ( a ) , we check that @xmath1 converges toward @xmath147 at long times @xmath170 for @xmath138 . for the large sweeping speed @xmath171 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ]  ( a ) , we find that this also holds for @xmath172 , since thermal effects only occur during the short period where @xmath173  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ]  ( b ) , we show results for slow sweep velocity @xmath174 , and observe clearly that the size of the jump in @xmath1 at the crossing reduces with enhancing dissipation and temperature . following the jump , we observe a decay of @xmath1 in the intermediate time regime up to @xmath9 due to bath mediated spin transitions .",
    "the final probability increases with temperature due to thermalization .",
    "we now derive an analytical formula describing the universal decay in the scaling regime at @xmath138 , which holds for slow sweeping speeds only . for large static detuning @xmath175",
