    "<S> an individual might might pick an artifact at random .      </S>",

    "<S> we will use the most general @xmath2 and @xmath3 for which ( [ neqngen ] ) is exact , namely @xmath11 this is equivalent to using a complete graph with self loops for the social network at this stage but these preferential attachment forms emerge naturally when using a random walk on a general network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this choice for @xmath3 has two other special properties : one involves the scaling properties @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> the second is that these exact equations can be solved analytically @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we find a second order linear differential equation for each of the eigenmodes with solution @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are well known in theoretical population genetics as those of the moran model @xcite and one may map the bipartite model directly onto a simple model of the genetics of a haploid population @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium result for the degree distribution @xcite is proportional to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this has three typical regions . </S>",
    "<S> we have a condensate , where most of the edges are attached to one artifact @xmath18 , for @xmath19 . on the other hand when @xmath20 we get a peak at small @xmath21 with an exponential fall off , a distribution which becomes an exact binomial at @xmath22 . in between </S>",
    "<S> we get a power law with an exponential cutoff , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for many parameter values </S>",
    "<S> the power @xmath26 will be indistinguishable from one and this is a characteristic signal of an underlying copying mechanism seen in a diverse range of situations ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .     for @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> shown are ( from top to bottom at low @xmath21 ) @xmath22 ( red crosses ) , @xmath28 ( green circles ) , @xmath29 ( blue stars ) and @xmath30 ( magenta squares ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> one of the best ways to study the evolution of the degree distribution @xcite is through the _ homogeneity measures _ , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the probability that @xmath32 distinct edges chosen at random are connected to same artifact , and is given by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> further , each @xmath31 depends only on the modes numbered @xmath34 to @xmath32 so they provide a practical way to fix the constants @xmath35 in the mode expansion . since @xmath36 and @xmath37 </S>",

    "<S> our first generalisation of the basic model is to consider two distinct communities of individuals , say @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) of type x ( y ) . </S>",
    "<S> the individuals of type x can now copy the choices made by their own community x with probability @xmath49 , but a different rate is used when an x copies the choice made by somebody in community y , @xmath50 . an x individual will then innovate with probability @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> another two independent copying probabilities can be set for the y community . at each time step </S>",
    "<S> we choose to update the choice of a member of community x ( y ) community with probability @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> complete solutions are not available but one can find exact solutions for the lowest order homogeneity measures and eigenvalues using similar techniques to those discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> the unilluminating details are given in @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> an obvious generalisation is to use a complex network as the individual s social network @xcite . when copying , done with probability @xmath54 , an individual does a random walk on the social network to choose another individual and finally to copy their choice of artifact , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fcopymodel3ind ] . </S>",
    "<S> the random walk is an entirely local process , no global knowledge of the social network is needed , so it is likely to be a good approximation of many processes found in the real world . </S>",
    "<S> it also produces an attachment probability which is , to a good approximation , proportional to the degree distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the alternative process of innovation , followed with probability @xmath55 , involves global knowledge through its normalisation @xmath1 in ( [ pirpiasimple ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however when @xmath56 this can represent innovation of new artifacts as it is likely that the arrival artifact has never been chosen before . </S>",

    "<S> the line is the analytic result where the social network is a complete graph with self loops . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 , @xmath60 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> results shown in fig.[fsocialnet ] show that the existence of hubs in the scale free social network enhances the condensate while large distances in the social networks , as with the lattices , suppress the condensate .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting example is the case of @xmath61 which is a voter model @xcite with noise ( innovation @xmath62 ) added . </S>",
    "<S> one can then compare the probability that a neighbour has a different artifact ( the interface density ) @xmath63 , a local measure of the inhomogeneity , with our global measure @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> these coincide when the social network is a complete graph . </S>",
    "<S> however as we move from 3d to 1d lattices , keeping @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath55 constant , we see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ flatcomp ] that both these local and global measures move away from the result for the complete graph but in opposite directions @xcite .    . </S>",

    "<S> suppose we first select the edge to be rewired and immediately remove it . then </S>",
    "<S> , based on this network of @xmath68 edges , we choose the arrival artifact with probability @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the original master equation ( [ neqngen ] ) is still valid and exact . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it can still be solved exactly giving exactly the same form as before , ( [ gmresult ] ) , but with @xmath68 not @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives very small differences of order @xmath70 when compared to the original simultaneous update used initially .    </S>",
    "<S> instead we will consider the simultaneous rewiring of @xmath71 edges in our bipartite graph at each step . </S>",
    "<S> we will choose the individuals , whose edges define the departure artifacts , in one of two ways : either sequentially or at random . </S>",
    "<S> the arrival artifacts will be chosen as before using @xmath3 of ( [ pirpiasimple ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the opposite extreme from the single edge rewiring case we started with ( @xmath72 ) is the one where all the edges are rewired at the same time , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the model used in @xcite to model various data sets on cultural transmission . </S>",
    "<S> it is also the classic fisher - wright model of population genetics @xcite . from this </S>",
    "<S> each homogeneity measure @xmath31 and the @xmath32-th eigenvector @xmath74 may be calculated in terms of lower order results @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . </S>",
    "<S> non trivial information again comes first from @xmath77 where @xmath78 comparing with the results for @xmath72 we see that there are large differences in the equilibrium solution and in the rate at which this is approached ( measured in terms of number of the rewirings made ) . for intermediate values of @xmath71 </S>",
