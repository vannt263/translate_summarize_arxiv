    "the recent discovery of a light scalar @xmath7 by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite has been a major step forward in our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the first run of the lhc has established its mass with an accuracy of better than @xmath8 and has provided evidence for its scalar nature with spin - parity @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , decay rates to gauge boson pairs show no significant deviations from their standard model ( sm ) values  @xcite within the present accuracy of around @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the overall agreement with the standard model is so far impressive .    however , theoretical arguments suggest that deviations should be expected",
    ". their absence would actually be rather puzzling and would point to a fine - tuned solution for electroweak symmetry breaking , where the lightness of the higgs would remain unexplained .",
    "deviations from the standard model parameters open the gate to new physics , expected to lie at the terascale in the form of weakly or strongly - coupled new interactions .",
    "so far the lhc has been able to test total decay rates of @xmath7 into gauge boson pairs .",
    "however , lhc run  2 , with a substantial increase in luminosity , will provide enough statistics to probe also differential distributions , thereby testing the standard model in much greater detail .    in this paper we will study in a model - independent way the impact of new physics in the full angular distribution of @xmath11 decay , with the @xmath12 on - shell and eventually decaying into a lepton pair .",
    "we will argue that @xmath11 is a useful channel not only for spin identification  , but also to test nonstandard couplings : it provides a rich 4-body angular distribution with a clean 4-lepton final - state signature . for earlier work see  @xcite .",
    "our results can be parametrized in terms of 6 independent dynamical form factors , which include the effects of virtual electroweak bosons ( @xmath13 and @xmath12 ) as well as heavier states , whose effects at the electroweak scale are encoded in contact interactions .",
    "since we aim at model independence , we will study the new physics contributions using the effective field theory ( eft ) scheme developed in  @xcite , which is the most general eft of the electroweak interactions .",
    "as opposed to particular models , the resulting set of new physics coefficients will remain undetermined .",
    "however , their natural sizes can still be estimated with the aid of power - counting arguments .",
    "certain aspects of this decay mode have already been discussed recently  , with a focus on the dilepton - mass distribution . the observation there is that mass distributions can unveil new physics structures in an otherwise sm - compatible integrated decay rate .",
    "this however comes at the expense of some fine - tuning in the new physics parameters .",
    "in contrast , by exploiting angular distributions one can identify structures that do not contribute to the integrated decay rate .",
    "thus , one can still be compatible with the sm decay rates without tuning the new - physics parameters .",
    "as opposed to loop - induced processes , such as @xmath14 , @xmath0 does not look a priori like a promising testing ground for new - physics effects .",
    "as we will show below , they are expected , at most , at the few @xmath15 level in certain observables .",
    "@xmath0 is however an exceptionally clean decay mode and the natural suppression of new physics can be compensated with statistics .",
    "in fact , the lhc running at 14 tev with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath16 will potentially be sensitive to new - physics effects in @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis also shows that cp - odd effects in @xmath0 are expected only at the per - mille level .",
    "the remainder of this paper will be organized as follows : in section 2 we will derive the full angular distribution for @xmath11 .",
    "expressions for the dynamical form factors in terms of eft coefficients will be given in section 3 , with a discussion of their expected sizes in both weakly and strongly - coupled scenarios . in section 4",
    "we will discuss some selected angular observables .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 while an appendix with kinematical details is provided for reference .",
    "we denote the amplitude for the @xmath17 decay of a higgs boson by @xmath18 , and the decay of an on - shell @xmath12-boson into a lepton pair by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath12-boson polarization . the fully differential decay rate for @xmath21 , followed by @xmath22 ,",
    "is then given , in the narrow - width approximation , by @xmath23 where we have defined @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the total width of the @xmath12 .",
    "the kinematics is further discussed in appendix [ sec : app ] .    for massless leptons",
    "the decay amplitudes can be written as ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 v(q_1)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath28 the form of the amplitude in ( [ m3def ] ) is valid through next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of the general electroweak effective lagrangian described in @xcite and in section [ sec : leff ] .",
    "the form factors @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are functions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the global normalization of the amplitude has been chosen such that in the standard model at leading order @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "summing over the final - state lepton polarizations gives @xmath37 where @xmath38 the previous expression factors out the angular dependence , @xmath39 being dynamical functions which depend only on the invariant masses @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",

    "it follows that to leading order in the standard model the observables @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which carry the dependence on @xmath31 , are zero , as one would expect from general cp considerations .    with sufficient data , a general fit to the angular distribution of the four final - state leptons",
    "could in principle extract all 9 terms @xmath39 in the fully differential decay rate ( [ dgamma ] ) , ( [ m3m2jj ] ) and ( [ jdef ] ) . from ( [ jji ] )",
    "we see that measuring @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , for example , would determine the 6 independent combinations @xmath47 all of the 6 form factors @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 could then be obtained .",
    "the remaining three observables @xmath48 , @xmath43 , @xmath49 give no independent information on these form factors .",
    "they can be used for a cross - check or as alternative input .",
    "the coefficients @xmath50 are not directly related to the process @xmath0 and have to be constrained independently from properties of @xmath12 decays .    with limited data , it is more efficient to extract the different @xmath39 projecting them from ( [ jdef ] ) . integrating the distribution in ( [ jdef ] ) over @xmath51",

    "for instance , the term @xmath53 can be extracted by integrating over @xmath51 and forming a suitable forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in section  [ sec : iii ] we examine this and other angular asymmetries in detail .",
    "the angular distribution in @xmath0 is similar to the one in the rare @xmath64-meson decay @xmath65 , which has been discussed for instance in .",
    "however , in the present case the angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 are on an equal footing , and accordingly the angular dependence in ( [ jdef ] ) is symmetric under the interchange of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "note in particular that the forward - backward asymmetry term @xmath53 is proportional to the product @xmath66 , thus representing a kind of correlated double asymmetry in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it vanishes when either @xmath54 or @xmath55 are integrated over their full range .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath65 , where a forward - backward asymmetry in the single angle @xmath54 exists due to the more complicated structure of the hadronic transition @xmath67 .",
    "in order to estimate the form factors @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in ( [ m3def ] ) and @xmath50 in ( [ m2def ] ) we will work with the nonlinear effective lagrangian discussed in @xcite . a subset of the relevant operators has also been discussed in  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is realized by spontaneously breaking a global @xmath68 down to @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting goldstone modes are then collected into a matrix @xmath70 transforming as @xmath71 under the global group .",
    "one also defines @xmath72 such that the sm subgroup @xmath73 is gauged . for convenience we will use the shorthand notation @xmath74 for the goldstone covariant derivative and the custodial symmetry breaking spurion @xmath75 .",
    "the higgs field @xmath7 is introduced as an additional light ( pseudo - goldstone ) boson , singlet under the sm gauge group .    with these definitions",
    "one has at leading order  @xcite @xmath76 for @xmath11 the final - state fermions can be taken massless to an excellent approximation and therefore we have omitted the yukawa terms above .",

    "the operators above give the most general direct contributions to the @xmath86 and @xmath87 vertices , but also lead to a renormalization of the fields and parameters  @xcite .",
    "these effects will be consistently included in all our results . as the fundamental electroweak parameters we will employ @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( @xmath12-standard definition ) .",
    "then the nlo corrections can finally be expressed in terms of the following effective interactions @xmath91l+ \\frac{h}{v } z_\\mu{\\bar{l}}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\bigg[h_v - h_a\\gamma_5\\bigg]l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for convenience , we have defined @xmath92 such that at leading order in the standard model @xmath93 . here",

    "we have defined @xmath101 in terms of the coefficients of ( [ effective ] ) , the form factors read @xmath102 in turn , the operators in the lagrangian ( [ effective ] ) can be expressed in terms of the basic eft operators listed before .",
    "for the coefficients this implies ( @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 and @xmath105 for simplicity , in ( [ omdef1 ] ) we have dropped the family indices , but one should keep in mind that the nlo corrections are in general different for electron and muon final states .",
    "incidentally , notice that @xmath106 also contain a universal ( family - independent ) contribution , proportional to @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which results from taking into account the nlo renormalization effects .",
    "@xmath108 above stands for the renormalization of the fermi constant , which includes 4-fermion operators not listed in ( [ naive1 ] ) .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    for completeness we will also discuss the weakly - coupled case using",
    "the eft developed in  @xcite using the notation of @xcite ( for different approaches see  @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant operators are now @xmath110 and ( @xmath111 ) @xmath112 for the cp - even and cp - odd sectors , respectively .",
    "the effect of @xmath113 is to renormalize the higgs kinetic term .",
    "this shift can be absorbed by a field redefinition of @xmath114 , which then affects the @xmath115 coupling .",
    "this is of no relevance for the distributions but affects the global normalization of the decay  @xcite . for comparison with the nonlinear case it is convenient to define @xmath116 .",
    "the result reads @xmath117 and @xmath118 it is worth noting that , while the contributions to @xmath119 and @xmath120 , encoded in @xmath121 and @xmath106 , respectively , come from the same ( family - dependent ) nlo operators , @xmath106 also receives a universal nlo renormalization through @xmath122 , @xmath123 and the operators associated with @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the contact term contribution to @xmath0 is in general uncorrelated to @xmath87 , even in the case of the linearly - realized higgs sector .",
    "similarly , the @xmath12 mass term and the @xmath86 vertex come from the same lo operator but nlo corrections renormalize them differently . as a result , @xmath124 in ( [ corrections2 ] ) .",
    "in section 2 we pointed out that at nlo there are 6 independent form factors entering the dynamical functions @xmath39 . with high enough statistics one can fit the full distribution @xmath125 to experimental data .",
    "however , at least in the first stages of the run  2 at the lhc , where statistics will be rather limited , it is more efficient to devise a set of observables that can project out the different form factor combinations through angular asymmetries .",
    "a possible strategy is to extract @xmath126 from the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath127 in @xmath54 and @xmath55 , after integration over @xmath51 : @xmath128 and @xmath129 from an asymmetry @xmath130 in the angle @xmath51 : @xmath131 knowing @xmath127 and @xmath132 , @xmath30 can be determined through the combinations @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "these can be extracted , respectively , from the total rate given in ( [ dgamds ] ) and the asymmetry @xmath135 , @xmath136 the observables discussed so far test new physics in the cp - even sector .",
    "cp - odd contributions are parametrized by @xmath31 , which can be determined through the structures @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "they can be extracted from 2 additional asymmetries in @xmath51 : @xmath139 similar cp - odd observables have been discussed previously in the literature  .    in order to assess the experimental relevance of these asymmetries",
    ", we will rely on numerical estimates of new - physics effects based on general power - counting arguments .",
    "accordingly , one would naively expect the nlo coefficients given in the previous section to be generically of @xmath140 , with @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , keeping track of the gauge couplings , we will assume @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the main source of deviations from the sm comes from @xmath146 in @xmath147 .",
    "this parameter measures the signal strength of @xmath77 , and is currently constrained to deviate less than @xmath148 from the sm . since our conclusions will be independent of it , we will set @xmath149 and @xmath150 for simplicity .",
    "new - physics corrections are then naturally dominated by @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "@xmath151 are constrained by the @xmath12 partial width and lep data sets bounds on them at the @xmath153 level  @xcite , which is within the eft expectation .",
    "@xmath152 are instead unconstrained , and might in principle attain values larger than the naive eft dimensional estimate because of numerical enhancements .",
    "consider , for instance , the local @xmath0 couplings @xmath152 to be induced by the tree - level exchange of a composite heavy vector resonance @xmath154 , mediating @xmath155 , @xmath156 . then @xmath157 .",
    "if @xmath158 is numerically smaller than @xmath159 by a factor of three , say , the resulting value of @xmath152 might be 5 - 10 times bigger than the naive eft estimate .",
    "this assumes consistency with other phenomenological constraints , which is plausible in view of the free parameters in this scenario .",
    "for simplicity we will consider a scenario where @xmath160 , with all other corrections set to zero .",
    "due to the smallness of @xmath161 in the sm , the most sensitive probes of new physics are those linear in @xmath162 , namely @xmath127 and @xmath163 , with corrections that can easily reach 50 - 100% .",
    "incidentally , notice that neither @xmath127 nor @xmath163 are constrained by the angular distributions collected for the spin - parity analysis  @xcite .",
    "this has to be compared with the mass distribution , with typical corrections of a few @xmath15 .",
    "however , both corrections are uncorrelated .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath164 controls @xmath127 and @xmath163 while @xmath165 affects the mass distribution .",
    "thus , one can get large corrections on the former while barely affecting the latter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerics ] we illustrate such scenarios for the parameter choices @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "1.0 cm   0.5 cm     with the lhc running at 14 tev and with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath16 , one expects around 6400 reconstructed events for @xmath0  @xcite . with such statistics one could in principle",
    "reach a @xmath168 sensitivity in the observables that we are discussing .",
    "since the overall effects for @xmath127 and @xmath163 lie around the @xmath15 level , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerics ] , they could be accessible at the lhc , at least in its final stage . regarding the cp - odd sector , within the range of validity of our eft , the asymmetries @xmath169 and @xmath170 are expected to be below the per - mille level and thus clearly out of reach for detection at the lhc .",
    "these estimates could be made more precise by analysing the size of the backgrounds associated to the specific angular dependences .",
    "such an analysis goes beyond the scope of the present paper , but naively they should be substantially reduced as compared to the total decay rate  @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath132 might turn out to be especially suited to extract @xmath129 with higher precision than through the total decay rate .    before closing this section",
    ", one should note that , strictly speaking , the form factors @xmath171 always appear in combination with @xmath50 in the products @xmath172 which account for the processes @xmath0 and @xmath173 , respectively . in order to determine @xmath171 with a certain precision ,",
    "@xmath50 should be known comparably well .",
    "unfortunately , with lep data the bounds on @xmath161 and @xmath174 are too loose to be informative  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the ilc could offer a clean determination of the @xmath175 couplings , since the center - of - mass enhanced corrections to @xmath176 production can be cast entirely in terms of these corrections  @xcite . as a result",

    "an analogous mechanism for @xmath177 couplings could in principle be pursued in a muon linear collider through @xmath178 .",
    "we have studied , in a general and systematic way , how the decay @xmath0 can be used to probe for physics beyond the standard model in the higgs sector . for this purpose",
    "we have employed a general parametrization of the amplitude in terms of form factors , neglecting lepton masses . in view of the large gap between the electroweak scale and the expected scale of new physics",
    ", an effective field theory approach appears to be the most efficient tool .",
    "we have computed the form factors in terms of the coefficients of an effective lagrangian , which is defined by the sm gauge symmetries , a light scalar singlet @xmath7 and the remaining sm particles , but is otherwise completely general .",

    "examples are : * * the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath127 measuring @xmath53 and @xmath163 measuring @xmath46 .",
    "these quantities are strongly suppressed in the sm because of the smallness of the vectorial coupling @xmath161 . on the other hand , this implies an enhanced relative sensitivity to new physics .",

    "* * cp violation in the coupling of @xmath7 to electroweak bosons is probed by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , which enter the terms in the decay distribution odd in the angle between the dilepton planes @xmath51 .",

    "the form factors are expressed in terms of the coefficients of the complete effective lagrangian at next - to - leading order , @xmath179 .",
    "we use the electroweak chiral lagrangian , extended to include a light higgs singlet @xmath7 , and take into account all nlo new - physics effects at tree level , including the renormalization of sm fields and parameters .",
    "the effective lagrangian for a linearly realized higgs is also considered with operators up to dimension 6 . *",
    "based on effective - theory power counting , the potentially dominant impact of new - physics arises from the leading - order @xmath180 coupling @xmath146 , which only affects the overall decay rate , but not the angular and dilepton - mass distributions .",
    "the latter can only be modified by the nlo coefficients in the lagrangian .",
    "* power counting gives a typical size of the nlo coefficients of @xmath181 , up to coupling constants and numerical factors . with this estimate",
    "the new - physics effects are typically small .",
    "in particular , the contributions of the virtual @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which could in principle be inferred from the profiles of the different mass distributions turn out to be at the per - mille level and therefore too small to be detected . somewhat larger effects ( up to 5% ) may be possible in specific scenarios , for instance from enhanced @xmath182 local couplings @xmath152 in a strongly - interacting higgs sector .",
