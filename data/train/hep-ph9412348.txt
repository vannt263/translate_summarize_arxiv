    "[ [ ellisnason],[nde ] ] .",
    "some results in heavy - quark electroproduction at hera have already been presented in ref .",
    "[ [ fmnrhera ] ] . the computer program we used for this work",
    "was developed in refs .",
    "[ [ mnr],[fmnrphoto ] ] , and is available upon request .",
    "we will not consider electroproduction cross sections for large photon virtuality , which has been recently discussed in ref .",
    "[ [ neerven ] ] .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss charm photoproduction , focussing especially on the theoretical uncertainties which are specific of hera physics . in section",
    "3 we give our results for bottom photoproduction . in section  4",
    "we present our results for charm and bottom production in @xmath1 collisions , and in section  5 we give our conclusions .",
    "in charm photoproduction at hera , because of the large center - of - mass energies available , the new problem arises ( which was not present in fixed target configurations ) of the presence of a large radiative effect , proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the squared center - of - mass energy of the photon - hadron system , and @xmath4 is the charm quark mass .",
    "this effect is the first manifestation of a whole tower of corrections behaving like @xmath5 , arising from the small-@xmath0 region . in the high energy limit ,",
    "@xmath6 may become of order 1 , and one should then worry about resumming all these contributions . a formalism for the resummation has been studied in refs .  [ [ smallx ] ] . in the present work , we will try to assess the importance of these effects at hera .",
    "following the work of ref .",
    "[ [ nde ] ] , in fig .",
    "[ tau_pnt_mrsa ] we show various contributions to the total pointlike photoproduction cross section , histogrammed as a function of the variable @xmath7 , defined as the ratio of the partonic versus the hadronic center - of - mass squared energies @xmath8 .    in the case of the pointlike component of photoproduction ,",
    "this ratio is simply equal to @xmath0 , the fraction of the hadron momentum carried by the parton .",
    "we see that in the next - to - leading @xmath9 contribution there is a sizeable hump away from the threshold region .",
    "the same behaviour is observed in the @xmath10 contribution .",
    "the hump arises from the fact that the next - to - leading parton cross section goes to a constant for large @xmath11 ( see figs . 2 and 3 of ref .  [ [ ellisnason ] ] ) .",
    "therefore , for a hypothetical gluon density of the form @xmath12 , the next - to - leading @xmath9 contribution to the total cross section would be given by _",
    "4m_c^2/s^1 ^(1)_g g(x)dx = _",
    "4m_c^2/s^1 ^(1)_g d x. observe that , were it not for the fact that the gluon density has some extra damping factor as @xmath13 , the dashed histogram in fig .",
    "[ tau_pnt_mrsa ] would go to a constant as @xmath13 . in the very high energy limit",
    ", the hump will therefore become a plateau , and its width would be roughly equal to @xmath14 .",
    "one can show that this problem does not stop at this order : at order @xmath15 the partonic cross section grows like @xmath16 , and this would give a contribution to the total cross section raising like @xmath17 with the energy .",
    "notice that fig .",
    "[ tau_pnt_mrsa ] was obtained using the mrsa parton densities [ [ mrsa ] ] , which have a relatively singular gluon distribution at small @xmath0 .",
    "this type of parton density emphasizes the threshold region .",
    "we therefore expect that when using parton densities with a more regular behaviour at small @xmath0 , the hump should be more pronounced .",
    "this is in fact the case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tau_pnt_hmrs ] , obtained using the parton densities hmrs  b allowed by the parametrization . ]",
    "[ [ hmrsb ] ]    the size of the hump relative to the total cross section can be taken as a measure of the importance of the small-@xmath0 regime . in fig .",
    "[ hump_point ] we plot the contribution to the total cross section coming from the hump , relative to the total and to the @xmath18 contribution .",
    "the hump contribution is defined as the integral of the @xmath19 term in @xmath20 , from its minimum point up to @xmath21 .",
    "we are thus led to conclude that resummation effects could be important at the typical center - of - mass energies explored by hera .",
    "furthermore , flatter parton densities lead to larger small-@xmath0 effects .",
    "a similar pattern was found in the context of hadroproduction of bottom quarks , in ref .",
    "[ [ collinsellis ] ] , where the all - order resummation of small-@xmath0 effects was actually performed for @xmath22 production at the tevatron .",
    "lacking a calculation of the effects of resummation in photoproduction , we will simply assume that it may give an enhancement equal to the square of the size of the hump relative to the total cross section , a pattern suggested by the results of ref .",
    "[ [ collinsellis ] ] . from fig .",
    "[ hump_point ] we can then conclude that our calculation may underestimate the total charm cross section by 20% to 40% , depending upon the parton density choice .",
    "sizeable small-@xmath0 effects are also present in the hadronic component of the charm cross section . in this case , we find that the relative importance of the hump contribution varies between 20% and 45% when the center - of - mass energy changes from 50 to 300 gev ( this result was obtained using the mrsa and grv  ho [ [ grv ] ] parton densities in the proton and the photon respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty on the final result is considerably smaller than other uncertainties .",
    "other important inputs in the computation of the total cross section are the value of @xmath23 and the gluon density in the proton .",
    "the world average for @xmath24 taken from the particle data book , ref .",
    "[ [ pdb94 ] ] , is @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath26mev ( the value of @xmath23 quoted in ref .",
    "[ [ pdb94 ] ] differs from ours because it actually refers to the 3-loop formula for @xmath27 , while we are quoting the 2-loop value ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the preferred value of @xmath23 used in the latest parton density parametrizations of the cteq group is 158  mev ( see ref .  [ [ cteq3 ] ] ) , while the mrsa parametrization uses 151  mev ( see ref .",
    "[ [ mrsa ] ] ) .",
    "these values are below the lowest extreme of the world average range .",
    "this is due to the well known fact that the determinations of @xmath27 from @xmath28 data tend to be higher than those from deep - inelastic scattering . in order to assess the error in our predictions coming from the uncertainties on @xmath23",
    ", we will therefore consider also the parton density set cteq2ml , which was fitted with @xmath29mev , a value close to the world average . in summary , our range for @xmath23 is 151  mev@xmath30mev , which does not cover the full uncertainty on the present knowledge of @xmath27 .",
    "we are forced to do so , since larger values of @xmath23 are too far from deep inelastic scattering determinations , and it would be difficult to assess their correlation with the gluon density in the proton .",
    "several uncertainties come into play in the extraction of the gluon density .",
    "its normalization is strongly constrained by the momentum sum rule , while its shape , at relatively moderate value of @xmath0 , is constrained by direct photon production data .",
    "deep inelastic scattering data constrain the gluon density for relatively small values of @xmath0 , where it affects the evolution of the singlet parton density . at very small values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the gluon density is in fact not yet known with precision .",
    "both the cteq and mrs groups assume that its small-@xmath0 behaviour is the same as that of @xmath31 , which is measured at hera down to values of @xmath0 of the order of @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "a measurement of the gluon density at @xmath33gev@xmath34 has recently been performed by the zeus collaboration@xmath35}$ ] .",

    "the sets mrsd@xmath36 and cteq2mf differ essentially in the assumed small-@xmath0 behaviour .",
    "they are consistent with the two extreme parametrizations of the zeus data , and we will therefore use them as the two extreme possibilities .    our results for the pointlike component of the charm cross section are shown in table  [ c_point_tab ] and in figs .  [ band_c_mrsa ] and [ band_c_lx ] . the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the charm quark mass is quite apparent .",
