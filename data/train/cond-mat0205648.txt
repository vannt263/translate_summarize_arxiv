    "the spirit that has traditionally guided the construction of approximate density functionals has been to collect as much information as possible about the fluid and cook up a functional out of it under reasonable simple assumptions .",
    "this is the idea behind widely used approximations such as the weighted density or the effective liquid approximations , which produce a functional out of the helmholtz free energy and direct correlation function of the fluid ( see evans 1992 for a review ) , or even more recent approaches ( zhou 2001a , 2001b ) which in addition incorporate the pair correlation function . as an alternative to this",
    "there stands rosenfeld s fundamental measure ( fm ) theory , whose aim is to construct the density functional upon geometrical grounds , and to obtain as output all the ingredients that classical approaches need as input . since rosenfeld s pioneering work for hard spheres ( rosenfeld 1989 ) , later extended approximately to nonspherical objects ( rosenfeld 1994 ) , this theory has developed far from its roots , giving rise to functionals for hard spheres that reproduce extraordinarily well the structure of the crystal phase ( tarazona 2000 ) , functionals for the fluid mixture of parallel hard cubes ( cuesta and martnez ",
    "ratn 1997a , 1997b ) which have been applied to study entropic demixing ( martnez  ratn and cuesta 1998 , 1999 ) and even functionals for soft interactions ( schmidt 1999 ) as well as for nonadditive mixtures ( schmidt 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "rosenfeld s original approach ( rosenfeld 1989 ) , applied to hard spheres , consisted of three steps : ( i ) decomposing the mayer function into a sum of convolutions of one  particle measures ; ( ii ) using these measures to define a set of weighted densities and assuming that the density functional depends on the density profile only through them , and ( iii ) determining the functional form by resorting to scaled  particle theory .",
    "the functional so obtained had an interesting functional structure and worked well when applied to problems such as the adsorption profiles at hard walls .",
    "however it dramatically failed the test of freezing because of some builtin singularities , which could be repaired by imposing exact dimensional reduction of the functional to _ zero  dimensional _ cavities , i.e.  cavities which do not hold more than one particle ( rosenfeld 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "this idea was later exploited by tarazona and rosenfeld ( 1997 ) and tarazona ( 2000 ) as a more fundamental idea to construct a functional free of divergences .",
    "the method amounts to extend to higher dimensions the exact form of the one  dimensional hard  rod functional ( percus 1976 ) and then add the appropriate extra terms ( with a form dictated by the original fm functional structure ) so as to cancel whatever exceeds the exact result when the functional is reduced to properly tailored zero  dimensional cavities .",
    "this method avoids the use of scaled  particle theory while at the same time imposes a first ",
    "principles constraint ( the zero  dimensional reduction ) to the functional .",
    "it is then not surprising that the resulting functional performs much better than the original one , for instance in describing the crystal phase ( tarazona 2000 ) .",
    "the fm functional for the fluid of parallel hard cubes was first obtained using rosenfeld s original method ( cuesta 1996 ) supplemented with the exact zero  dimensional reduction requirement ( cuesta and martnez ",
    "ratn 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "but this system seems to be more suitable for fm theory than the hard ",
    "sphere one , by at least two reasons : first , because the functional turns out to be derivable through an extraordinarily simple recipe , and second , because , as we will show for its lattice counterpart , the method of cavities leads precisely to that functional . and",
    "this remains true not only for the monocomponent system but also for a mixture , where the fm functional for hard spheres shows its more prominent weaknesses ( cuesta 2002 ) .    in principle nothing precludes us from extending this theory to lattice systems .",
    "however , when one naively tries to do this immediately runs into difficulties . to illustrate them",
    "let us suppose we want to follow ronsenfeld s method . to begin with , there is no equivalent to scaled  particle theory for lattice fluids ( soto  campos 1999 ) and it is not clear how to devise it , so this makes step ( iii ) of the derivation infeasible .",
    "but there is even more : the decomposition of the mayer function is ambiguous in the sense that there is not a unique way to define the fundamental measures .",
    "take , for instance , the one  dimensional fluid of hard rods in the continuum .",
    "the fourier transform of its mayer function is @xmath1 where the indices @xmath2 are introduced to distinguish particles and @xmath3 is the rod length of particle @xmath4 .",
    "as it is clear from this expression , the decomposition suggests itself . for the lattice counterpart of this model we have , however , @xmath5 without being too imaginative",
    ", there are several ways of decomposing @xmath6 , all equally plausible : @xmath7 and many other possibilities .",
    "contrary to the continuum case , this gives no clue as to how to define the weighted densities .",
    "an alternative to this approach is to use the method of cavities , but there is also a problem here .",
    "the exact one  dimensional functional ( robledo 1980 , robledo and varea 1982 , buschle 2000a ) is very different in its structure from the continuum one , so there is no equivalent to defining convolutions of delta  shells with appropriate kernels ( we will see later that this has no counterpart in a lattice system ) .",
    "so here again we do not have a guide to follow .",
    "the method we have employed to achieve the extension and to provide the right way to define what could be referred to as _ lattice fundamental measure theory _",
    "( lfmt ) , rests on two pillars : first , an appropriate analysis of the extension to mixtures of the exact one  dimensional functional of hard rods ( which , to our knowledge , we present for the first time in this article ) , and second , a similarity , in the case of cubic lattices , with the fluid of parallel hard cubes . after devising the right way to define lfmt",
    "we will show how to make sense of the theory of cavities for lattice fluids .",
    "a further byproduct of this theory is that it would allow for an alternative way to define a scaled  particle theory for lattice fluids were we able to fill in step ( iii ) of rosenfeld s method in such a way as to get the same functional .",
    "we are currently working along this line .",
    "the structure of the article goes as follows . in",
    "we analyze the mixture of hard rods on a lattice .",
    "this means considering two cases : ( a ) all rod diameters having the same parity , and ( b ) some having odd and some even diameter .",
    "the former corresponds to an additive mixture , while the latter is nonadditive .",
    "the functional for case ( a ) is derived first , following vanderlick s ( 1989 ) derivation for the continuum ; this method can not be applied to case ( b ) , which is then obtained through an appropriate mapping to an additive mixture in a particular external field .",
    "the way in which those exact functionals are finally written suggests , by analogy with the fluid of parallel hard cubes , the extension to higher dimensions ( only in cubic lattices ) .",
    "this is carried out in , where it is also proven that this extension has a correct dimensional reduction to any lower dimension .",
    "it is then show how to extend the method of cavities for these lattice models .",
    "finally , in , we present some results from applying the obtained functional to some particular two and three  dimensional systems .",
    "the exact density functional for the continuum fluid of hard rods was first obtained by percus ( 1976 ) and extended to multicomponent mixtures by vanderlick ( 1989 ) .",
    "robledo ( 1980 ) and robledo and varea ( 1981 ) derived the exact functional for the lattice fluid of hard rods by means of potential  distribution theory ( widom 1978 ) , but they focused on the continuum limit .",
    "buschle ( 2000b ) have recently dealt with the general problem of the derivation of exact density functionals for one  dimensional lattice gases with finite  range pairwise interaction .",
    "they made use of a generalized markov property satisfied by the conditional particle distribution probabilities . in this way ,",
    "they rederived ( buschle 2000a ) the functional for the monocomponent hard  rod lattice fluid .    in this section",
    ", we are going to derive the exact density functional of a multicomponent lattice fluid of hard rods .",
    "the starting point will be the adaptation to lattice models of vanderlick s ( 1989 ) derivation for the continuum .",
    "let us consider a system of hard rods with different sizes , such that the interaction between @xmath8type and @xmath9type rods at positions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , on a one  dimensional lattice ( i.e.  @xmath12 ) is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the diameter of an @xmath8type rod . because of the particle ordering in one  dimensional systems , the pairwise interaction will appear in the grand canonical partition function @xmath16 via the modified boltzmann factor , defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 if @xmath19 and @xmath20 otherwise , and @xmath21 with @xmath22 the temperature and @xmath23 the boltzmann constant .",

    "for the additive continuum system it can be shown that this is of rank one , and then it is possible to solve those equations .",
    "on the contrary , for the lattice system we are dealing with , this is not always true . in this case ,",
    "due to the discrete nature of the system , we should distinguish between a mixture of rods all of them with even(odd ) diameters ( _ additive mixture _ ) and one of rods some of which have even diameter and some odd ( _ nonadditive mixture _ ) .",
    "indeed , for the former case , @xmath51 is always an integer and , consequently , from it follows that the corresponding mixture is additive .",

    "pursuing the same idea but having in mind the form of functionals and , we have devised a similar method suitable for lattice models .",
    "the method amounts to ( a ) directly extending the exact zero  dimensional functional to higher dimensions ( note here a difference with the continuum case ( tarazona and rosenfeld 1997 ) , where it is the one  dimensional functional what is extended to higher dimensions ) , and then ( b ) adding the appropriate extra terms ( in the way suggested by and ) in order for the functional to recover the exact form when applied to zero  dimensional cavities .",

    "the extension of this argument to arbitrary dimension proves that is the functional produced by the cavities method .",
    "in addition , it is also proved its consistent dimensional reduction to any lower dimension .",
    "in order to show the applicability of the theory exposed in the previous sections , in this one we present the results obtained for some particular two and three  dimensional systems .",
    "the hard square lattice gas is just the lattice gas with first and second nearest  neighbour exclusion in the simple square lattice .",
    "this system has been widely studied ( bellemans and nigam 1967 , ree and chesnut 1967 , nisbet and farquhar 1974 , slotte 1983 ) but no definitive conclusion has been reached about its phase behaviour .",
    "the results reported cover the whole spectrum , depending on which theory has been used to study it .",
    "some authors have claimed it to have a second order transition ( bellemans and nigam 1967 , slotte 1982 ) , others a weaker ( third order ) transition ( bellemans and nigam 1967 , ree and chesnut 1967 ) and others even no transition at all ( bellemans and nigam 1967 , nisbet and farquhar 1974 , slotte 1982 ) .",
    "nowadays , the only thing that seems clear is the structure of the ordered phase : periodic along one coordinate axis while uniform along the other ( i.e.  columnar ) .",
    "however , no simulations have ever been performed in order to clarify the disputed order of the transition .",
    "the result of fm theory is shown in .",
    "the system is found to have a second order transition from a fluid phase to a columnar phase .",
    "the value of the packing fraction at the transition is @xmath178 and the chemical potential at that point @xmath179 .",
    "this result is compatible with that obtained by bellemans and nigam ( 1967 ) using rushbrooke and scoins s ( 1955 ) method .",
    "they also found a second order transition , but at @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the equation of state they obtained with that method is compared with the fm result in .",
    "there is good agreement between both theories , being only in the critical region where the two curves deviate from each other .",
    "it is worth mentioning that within the fm approximation this system is analytically solvable . omitting the calculations and denoting @xmath182 ,",
    "we have obtained for the helmholtz free energy density of the fluid branch @xmath183 and for the columnar branch @xmath184,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the occupancy probability of a sublattice is given by @xmath185    clearly more work , either by means of simulations or by other methods , is needed in order to resolve the nature of the transition .",
    "this notwithstanding , we do not expect good agreement except at low or high pressures ; critical points are difficult ( sometimes impossible ) to capture , even approximately , with mean  field  like theories like this one .",
    "nevertheless , we think of the fm approach to be valuable in the sense that ( i ) it is possible to obtain an analytic approximation ; ( ii ) the result obtained is compatible with one previously reported using a different theory , and ( iii ) it correctly predicts the structure of the ordered phase .      we have also applied the theory to three  dimensional systems . in this section we present the results obtained for the monocomponent systems of parallel hard cubes of edge lengths @xmath186 and @xmath187 , as well as for the binary mixture of them .",
    "these being three  dimensional systems , the ordered phases that compete in the phase diagrams are three : smectic ( one  dimensional order ) , columnar ( two  dimensional order ) and solid ( three  dimensional order ) .",
    "the period of the ordering is determined from the wave  vector at which the first divergence of the structure factor occurs . in the first case this is @xmath188 ,",
    "hence the period is 2 . as this is also the period of the closest ",
    "packed phase it is the only one that is found in stable phases . in the second case the wave",
    "vector is @xmath189 , implying a period 7 ; however , in this case the closest  packed phase has period 6 , so both , period6 and period7 phases must be considered .",
    "the same holds for the binary mixture .",
    "equation of state obtained from fm theory for the monocomponent hard cube lattice gas with edge lengths @xmath186 ( a ) and @xmath187 ( b ) .",
    "phases are labeled f ( fluid ) , sm@xmath190 ( smectic ) and c@xmath190 ( columnar ) , where @xmath191 stands for the ordering period .",
    "the inset in part ( a ) shows a very narrow first order sm@xmath192c@xmath192 transition . , width=491 ]    the results for the monocomponent systems are shown in figures [ fig6]a @xmath193 and [ fig6]b @xmath194 .",
    "the first system undergoes , at @xmath195 , a second order transition from a fluid phase ( f ) to a period2 smectic one ( sm@xmath192 ) . at a higher value of the packing fraction",
    "the system is found to have a very narrow first order phase transition , where the smectic phase at @xmath196 coexists with a period2 columnar phase ( c@xmath192 ) at @xmath197 ( see the inset in a ) .",
    "for the @xmath187 system we find a more complex scenario with several ordered phases , due to the proximity of their free energies .",
    "there are six ordered phases in competition : smectic , columnar and solid with both periods 6 and 7 .",
    "only three of them , the two columnar and the period7 solid , are stable in some region .",
    "the other three are just metastable .",
    "again , the columnar phase is the most stable at high density ( notice the difference of the high density ordered phase of these lattice systems with respect to that of the continuum model ( groh and mulder 2001 ) ) .",
    "upon increasing density , the sequence of transitions is as follows : first , a second order one at @xmath198 from a fluid phase ( f ) to a period7 solid phase ( s@xmath199 ) ; then a first order transition in which the s@xmath199 solid coexists , at @xmath200 , with a period7 columnar phase ( c@xmath199 ) , at @xmath201 ; finally , another first order transition with the c@xmath199 columnar at @xmath202 coexisting with a period6 columnar phase ( c@xmath203 ) at @xmath204 .",
    "this latter phase extends up to the closest - packing .",
    "phase diagram ( reduced pressure , @xmath205 , vs.  composition , @xmath206 ) of the lattice binary mixture of hard cubes ( size ratio 6:2 ) .",
    "composition is defined by @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the total packing fraction of the large ( l ) and small ( s ) cubes .",
    "phases are labeled as in .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the spinodal of the uniform fluid . for",
    "@xmath209 it marks a stable continuous f - s@xmath199 phase transition.,width=453 ]    the competition of different ordered phases in the latter system is remarkable , but it produces a real mess when the two kind of cubes are mixed .",
    "the phase diagram for this binary mixture ( pressure vs.  composition ) is shown in .",
    "all possible phases are present there .",
    "a few particularly complex regions are shown in more detail .",
    "remarkable features of this phase diagram are the very wide f ",
    "c@xmath203 phase separation dominating the lower part of the diagram , and the extraordinarily narrow s@xmath203c@xmath203 coexistence , extremely close to the monocomponent fluid of large cubes .",
    "the latter tells us about the proximity of the free energy of the solid phase to that of the columnar in this monocomponent system ( a small amount of ` impurities ' breaks the translational symmetry along the columns of the columnar phase transforming it into a solid ) .",
    "the former has a very important consequence concerning the demixing scenario for this system .",
    "this binary mixture has been reported , from simulations ( dijkstra and frenkel 1994 ) , to demix into two fluid phases . as a matter of fact , this is , as far as we know , the only existing evidence of an entropy  driven fluid  fluid demixing in an additive binary mixture . in all other systems of the same kind , e.g.hard spheres ( dijkstra 1999 ) or parallel hard cubes in the continuum ( martnez  ratn and cuesta 1998 , 1999 ) , fluid ",
    "fluid demixing is preempted by freezing of ( at least ) the largest component .",
    "our results contradict this simulations and fit in what seems to be the standard scenario of demixing for additive binary mixtures , namely fluid  ordered phase demixing ( the fact that the ordered phase is a columnar is just a peculiarity of the model ) . a more detailed analysis of this result can be found in lafuente and cuesta ( 2002 ) .",
    "in this article we have proposed a formulation of fm theory for lattice models . as it was mentioned in the introduction , it is not possible just to carry on with rosenfeld s original formulation but in discrete space .",
    "this is so because of the lack of a scaled  particle theory for lattice models .",
    "in fact , fm theory in the continuum can be regarded as a generalization of scaled  particle theory to inhomogeneous phases .",
    "for this reason , we believe that the knowledge of a lattice fm theory could guide the derivation of a lattice scaled  particle theory .",
    "we are presently working in that direction .",
    "in the recent reformulations of fm theory the scaled  particle equation of state is no more an input but an output of the theory .",
    "two fundamental ideas appear as the keystone of these formulations : ( i ) the exact density functional must have a consistent dimensional reduction to any lower dimension , and ( ii ) the exact zero  dimensional limit is necessary for the correct description of the freezing transition .",
    "the latter turns out to be a very stringent constraint for the functional and seems to contain most of the information needed for the construction of a higher dimensional functional . in this context , the zero  dimensional cavities method appears as a scheme for the construction of fm functionals .",
    "the lattice fm theory we have proposed is the generalization of this method suggested by the exact form of the functional of the one  dimensional mixture of hard rods on a lattice .",
    "although this system has been previously studied in the literature , the originality of our derivation is that ( i ) it is the first time that the distinction between additive and nonadditive mixtures have been noticed and resolved , and ( ii ) the exact functional is written in a form in which the zero  dimensional functional arises naturally .",
    "the cavities method can be extended to other particle shapes and other lattice structures",
    ". this will be the content of a future work .",
    "we have applied the functional to two and three  dimensional models and found very reasonable results . in two dimensions",
    "these are comparable to those previously obtained by other means , and in three dimensions they agree with previous simulations data , in the case of the mixture ( lafuente and cuesta 2002 ) , although with an utterly different interpretation which has yet to be confirmed .",
    "one remarkable feature of all three  dimensional models is the very rich and complex phase diagrams they possess ( specially the mixture ) , a complexity which the present theory has nevertheless allowed us to tackle without problems ."
