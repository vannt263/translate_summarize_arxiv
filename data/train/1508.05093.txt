    "in particular , the x - ray - powered model explains the macronova with smaller ejecta mass .",
    "the @xmath0-process model must satisfy all the conditions which the x - ray - powered model satisfies , in addition to having the correct amount of @xmath0-process material to generate the observed infrared luminosity by radioactive decay , as well as to having the correct diffusion time at the observed peak time @xmath133 .",
    "then , the allowed parameter range of the ejecta mass has to be much narrow in the @xmath0-process model . in the previous engine - powered models",
    "@xcite , the energy injection occurs at @xmath134 s , earlier than the macronova emission . to confine the injected internal energy in the ejecta up to the macronova timescale @xmath19 s ,",
    "the ejecta satisfy the condition @xmath135 until @xmath19 s. this condition always requires the larger ejecta mass than that of the x - ray - powered model .",
    "we also apply the x - ray - powered model to the other macronova candidates , grb 060614 and grb 080503 .",
    "the @xmath0-process ejecta with the mass @xmath136 and the velocity @xmath119 can explain the optical - infrared excess in grb 060614 . as oppose to the @xmath0-process heating model @xcite , the x - ray - powered model allows relatively small ejecta mass expected for the ns - ns mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in grb 080503",
    ", the allowed parameter range does not overlap with that in grb 130603b expect for the case that grb 080503 has the iron ejecta while grb 130603b has the @xmath0-process ejecta .",
    "this may imply ejecta that are in part made of iron and in part made of @xmath0-process elements , as suggested by numerical simulations that find anisotropic electron fraction in the ejecta of ns - ns mergers .    in the case that the temperature in the ejecta becomes low ( @xmath137 k ) , dust may form in the ejecta depending on the ejecta composition @xcite .",
    "the dust enhances the opacity of the ejecta .",
    "then , the thermalization occurs for lower mass density of the ejecta than figure [ figure : parameter ] ( condition ( [ thermalization_condition_for_velocity ] ) ) . on the other hand",
    ", photons can escape in the ejecta only with lower mass density ( condition ( [ escape_condition_for_velocity ] ) ) . as a result",
    ", the allowed region moves toward lower ejecta mass than figure [ figure : parameter ] .",
    "@xcite suggested that ejecta is fully ionized and x - ray photons freely escape after @xmath90 1 day for their magnetar model with the x - ray luminosity @xmath138 erg s@xmath7 . in our model ,",
    "the irradiated x - ray luminosity is much smaller than their magnetar model ( @xmath138 erg s@xmath7 ) , so that the ejecta are not fully ionized .    as the x - ray excess component",
    ", we consider the activity near the central engine , such as the accretion disk .",
    "using the fallback model with the temporal evolution of the mass accretion rate @xmath139 at @xmath140 and the radiative efficiency @xmath141 , the luminosity from the disk is @xmath6 erg s@xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the total fallback mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the ratio of the fallback mass @xmath143 to the ejecta mass @xmath104 is @xmath28 in our model , which is consistent with the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "if the central engine activity comes from the magnetar , the luminosity is @xmath6 erg s@xmath144 where @xmath145 is the surface dipole magnetic field and the @xmath146 is the rotation period of the ns at 7 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since the x - ray excess component roughly follows the temporal index @xmath67 , the period @xmath146 has been slowed down at 7 days .",
    "there are important implications of the x - ray - powered macronovae for the search of the electromagnetic counterparts to gw sources .",
    "if we can first observe the x - ray emission originated from the central engine @xcite , the thermal emission from the ejecta could be estimated from the x - ray emission as the luminosity @xmath147 and the temperature @xmath148 as long as the ejecta satisfy the conditions ( [ absorption_condition])@xmath149([escape_condition ] ) .",
    "even if the ejecta initially prevent the detection of x - ray photons from the central engine , the ejecta become optically thin to the x - ray tens of days after the merger .",
    "the luminosity is about @xmath150 erg s@xmath7 , which could be detectable by _",
    "swift_/xrt with integration time @xmath151 s within 100 mpc @xcite .",
    "if the x - ray from the central engine is significantly faint , other heating sources would become dominant such as the @xmath0-process and the shorter timescale activities of the central engine ( extended and plateau emissions ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray observations are important to distinguish the main heating source of the macronovae",
