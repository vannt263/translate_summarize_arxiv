    "the factorization of linear partial differential operators ( lpdos ) is an essential part of recent algorithms for the exact solution for linear partial differential equations ( lpdes ) .",
    "examples of such algorithms include numerous generalizations and modifications of the 18th - century laplace transformations method  @xcite , the loewy decomposition method  @xcite , and others .",
    "the problem of constructing a general factorization algorithm for an lpdo is still an open problem , although several important contributions have been made in recent decades , and different approaches have been applied ( see  @xcite and many others ) . many of the recent approaches are concerned , in particular , with explaining the non - uniqueness of factorization : ( irreducible ) factors and the number of factors are not necessarily the same for two different factorizations of the same operator .",
    "this is commonly illustrated by the famous example of landau  @xcite ,    @xmath0    where the second - order factor in the second factorization is hyperbolic and is irreducible .",
    "on the other hand , for some classes of lpdos factorization is unique .",
    "for example , there is no more than one factorization that extends a factorization of the principal symbol of the operator into co - prime factors  @xcite .",
    "algebraic theories have been introduced to explain this phenomenon theoretically ; see tsarev  @xcite , grigoriev and schwarz  @xcite and most recently cassidy and singer  @xcite",
    ".    some important methods of exact integration , for example , the loewy decomposition methods mentioned above , require lpdos to have a number of different factorizations of certain types .",
    "also completely reducible lpdos introduced in  @xcite , which become significant as the solution space of a completely reducible lpdo coincides with the sum of those of its irreducible right factors may require a number of right factors .    in earlier work  @xcite we have exhaustively studied families of factorizations for operators up to order @xmath1 , and described when the same operator has multiple factorizations of _ the same factorization type _ , to be more specific , when there exist an infinite number of factorizations of the same factorization type , meaning having the same symbols of the factors .",
    "the first non - trivial example of such families of order @xmath1 has been found :    @xcite the following is a fourth - order irreducible family of factorizations : @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "note that the first two factors commute .",
    "so the operator @xmath4 has a family of factorizations , and every factorization of the family is of the same factorization type @xmath5 , that is the highest order terms in the first , the second and the third factors are @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspondingly .    in recent work  @xcite non - uniqueness of a different kind",
    "is addressed .",
    "there , we considered factorizations of _ different factorization types _ , and by using invariants proved that a third - order bivariate operator @xmath9 has a first - order left factor of the symbol @xmath10 and a first - order right factor of the symbol @xmath11 , where @xmath12 if and only if it has a complete factorization of the type @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "further investigations in the same paper show that a third - order bivariate operator @xmath9 has a first - order left factor @xmath15 and a first - order right factor @xmath16 with @xmath17 if and only if @xmath9 has a factorization into three factors , the left one of which is exactly @xmath15 and the right one is exactly @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite the existence of two factorizations for an lpdo , @xmath18 implies the existence of the `` complete '' factorization of @xmath19 , @xmath20    on the other hand , if the condition @xmath17 fails , then it can happen that the `` complete '' factorization does not exist .",
    "@xcite @xmath21 while @xmath22 has no factorization at all .    in the present paper",
    "we have generalized the result of  @xcite to the case of lpdos of arbitrary order and of arbitrary dimension .",
    "moreover , a more general statement has been formulated and proved for incomplete factorizations of lpdos .",
    "we describe the results in terms of common obstacles , which we have introduced in  @xcite .",
    "consider a field @xmath23 of characteristic zero with commuting derivations @xmath24 , and the corresponding non - commutative ring of linear partial differential operators ( lpdos ) @xmath25=k[d_1 , \\dots , d_n]$ ] , where @xmath26 corresponds to the derivation @xmath27 for all @xmath28 . in @xmath25",

    "any operator @xmath33 $ ] has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a multi - index in @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and where @xmath38 .",
    "further , there exists some @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 is the order of @xmath9 . for the case",
    "@xmath43 we define the order as @xmath44 .",
    "when considering the bivariate case @xmath45 , we use the following formal notations : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , and correspondingly @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for ease of notation .    for an operator @xmath53 of the form  ( [ op : general_form_inkd ] ) the homogeneous commutative polynomial @xmath54 in formal variables @xmath55 is called the ( _ principal _ ) _ symbol _ , and if @xmath43 , the symbol is defined to be zero .",
    "vice versa , given a homogeneous commutative polynomial @xmath56 $ ] in the form  ( [ sym : general_form_inkd ] ) , we define the operator @xmath57 $ ] as the result of substituting @xmath26 for each variable @xmath58 .",
    "since for two lpdos @xmath59 $ ] we have @xmath60 , any factorization of an lpdo extends some factorization of its symbol . in general , if @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 , let us say that the factorization @xmath63 is of the factorization type @xmath64 .    for the second - order hyperbolic lpdos , which have normalized form @xmath65 where @xmath66",
