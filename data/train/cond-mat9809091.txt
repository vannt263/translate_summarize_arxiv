    "the surface roughening transition and the nature of the rough phase are theoretically very well understood by a variety of approaches ranging from phenomenological descriptions , based on the sine - gordon model , to microscopic solid - on - solid ( sos ) models.@xcite    the preroughening transition ( pr ) and the ensuing disordered flat phase ( dof ) , both predicted several years ago by rommelse and den nijs,@xcite have also been studied and characterized within certain restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models . @xcite",
    "although the physics behind these models , and the ingredients stabilizing the dof phase , have been discussed in some detail , it is still useful to explore this subject from a different , and perhaps more physically appealing , perspective .",
    "the rsos models , in particular , do not directly emphasize steps , terraces , and kinks , which on the other hand are very crucial actors in these transitions . this need is made more urgent by the recent experimental evidences for preroughening on rare gas solid ( 111 ) surfaces,@xcite which calls for a detailed reinvestigation of the step - step interactions , @xcite or the reconstructive tendencies , @xcite crucial to obtain a dof phase .    in the context of roughening , villain and vilfan,@xcite den nijs,@xcite and balents and kardar,@xcite for the case of reconstructed surfaces , and villain , grempel , and lapujoulade,@xcite for the case of vicinal surfaces , have shown that a more phenomenological approach based on working directly with steps yields a very direct picture of the physics involved .",
    "anisotropic surfaces , in particular , have a definite direction of stronger bonding along which a step tends to run ; kinks on such steps , involving the breaking of strong bonds , are energetically expensive .",

    ", the transfer matrix problem for the system of steps can be mapped onto the imaginary - time evolution of a system of quantum particles in one dimension ( 1d ) , the imaginary - time being the preferred direction in which the steps run.@xcite this is a well known mapping , heavily exploited , for instance , in the theory of uniaxial commensurate - to - incommensurate transitions of adsorbates.@xcite    following a line of thought initiated by ref .",
    "@xcite , balents and kardar applied the full machinery of the theory of interacting fermions in one dimension to explore the possible phase diagrams of generic @xmath3 reconstructed anisotropic surfaces.@xcite in their approach , steps of double height are forbidden ( as energetically too expensive ) , while up and down monoatomic steps are mapped onto spin-1/2 fermions in 1d , described ( in the continuum limit ) by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the inverse line tension of a step , @xmath6 is an interaction between steps , and the remaining notation is standard .",
    "this hamiltonian describes infinite steps , traversing the entire length of the sample , as the number of particles is conserved by the ( imaginary - time ) dynamics . in reality",

    "balents and kardar argued , by power counting , that the effect of finite terraces , i.e. , the introduction of @xmath11 , is irrelevant for @xmath12 , marginal for @xmath13 , and strongly relevant for @xmath14 .",
    "they went on by addressing in detail the @xmath13 case , of relevance to the ( 110 ) missing - row reconstructed facet of au .",

    "however , the unreconstructed ( @xmath14 ) case was not pursued further .",
    "the approach we take in the present paper is similar in spirit .",
    "our specific goal , however , is to address the question of the presence of a dof phase , and the preroughening transition , for unreconstructed surfaces .",
    "thus , in the classification introduced above , we are now interested in detail in the @xmath14 case .",
    "technically , this leads , as we shall see , to significant differences with respect , for instance , to ref .",
    "@xcite , and to a new phase diagram quite different from the @xmath15 cases .",
    "the crucial point is that for @xmath14 the loop terms ( see eq .",

    "this might appear as just a minor complication , at first glance , since quadratic terms can be easily diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "closer consideration , however , leads to reconsider the whole mapping .",

    ", a hard - core constraint will be necessary , in order to implement the appropriate configurational space ( for instance , the non - crossing constraint for steps of the same type ) . in a one - dimensional quantum problem",
    ", the choice of the statistics is , quite often , not a big problem , as we can transform , by a wigner - jordan transformation , hard - core bosons into fermions , with a transformed hamiltonian which has exactly the same form ( only boundary conditions have to be considered carefully ) . in our case , however , pairing terms of the type @xmath17 , which ( see below ) are essential to describe finite terraces , do not transform into simple fermionic bcs - like terms , and become non - local after a wigner - jordan transformation .",
    "this will force us to work with hard - core bosons .",
    "our approach , in summary , is as follows .",
    "we assume , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the only relevant extended defects are monoatomic steps , which can be either _ up _ or _ down_. steps of the same kind are forbidden to cross , while steps of different type can cross .",
    "moreover , steps interact with each other , have kinks , and can form finite terraces on the surface .",
    "these steps are then mapped onto world - lines of hard - core bosons in one dimension .",
    "kinks on the steps correspond to hopping terms in the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "pairs of up - down steps which are created and annihilated to form finite terraces on the surface , give number - non - conserving terms in the quantum hamiltonian.@xcite pairwise interactions between the steps are taken into account by corresponding two - body terms in the quantum model .",
    "the present work is concerned with the case of a low - index unreconstructed surface .",
    "extensions to the case of vicinals , for which the long - ranged nature of the step - step interactions is an essential ingredient , are left to a future study .    our main goals in working out this type of approach to pr",
    "are the following : ( a ) to build a formulation providing a more direct access to the physics of pr , which is somewhat hidden in the rsos formulations ; ( b ) to explore more directly the role of step - step interactions ; ( c ) to study step - step correlation functions and terrace width distributions , not available so far .",

    "superimposed on the leading exponential , the dof case results show a strong oscillating short range component which is again due to the neighboring reconstructed ( nel ) phase .",
    "two more features are worth noticing .",

    "second , in the dof case @xmath252 is one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath255 , while the difference is much smaller in the rough case .",
    "these features are reasonable in view of the diluted antiferromagnetic ordering of steps , typical of the dof phase .",

    "this , in turn , leads to a finite roughening temperature for the classical model .",
    "finite - size exact diagonalizations and bosonization techniques have been used to unveil the richness of the phase diagram . in the limit of @xmath257 and for a particular choice of parameters ( the potentials , for instance ,",

    "in particular , we observe a dof phase even for @xmath163 ( see sec .  [ v1_perp_0:sec ] ) .",
    "moreover , a dof phase is present not only for @xmath69 ( spin-1 case ) but also when @xmath161 is finite , as long as positive .",

    "[ xy : sec ] ) .",
    "thus , the opposite step crossing term is _ crucial _ in order to obtain a model describing , at least at a coarse grained level , a physical surface .",
