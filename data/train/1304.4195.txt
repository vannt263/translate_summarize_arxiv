    "predicts that the md intensity of @xmath162 should vanish at @xmath91 .",
    "but experiments @xcite indicate that @xmath162 survives for thz field orientation @xmath250 in zero field , albeit with the @xmath250 intensity reduced by about 90% compared to the @xmath173 intensity .",
    "experimentally @xcite , the @xmath250 intensities of @xmath164 and @xmath202 at @xmath91 are larger for the field - treated sample than for the non - field - treated sample .",
    "this implies that @xmath248 is larger for domain 1 than for domains 2 and 3 .",
    "but the only nonzero md matrix element for @xmath164 in zero field is @xmath209 .",
    "so as shown in figs.5(h ) and ( j ) for @xmath164 and @xmath202 , @xmath251 as @xmath252 in domain 1 .",
    "the remarkable agreement between the predicted and measured spectroscopic mode frequencies of the cycloidal phase leaves no doubt that a model with dm interactions along @xmath31 and @xmath225 and easy - axis anisotropy along @xmath29 provides the foundation for future studies of multiferroic .",
    "however , the previous section exposed several discrepancies between the predicted and observed mode intensities which must be addressed .",
    "specifically , modes that are activated by the anharmonicity and tilt of the cycloid are still too weak compared to measurements . whereas our model predicts that @xmath249 should not appear in zero field for domain 1 with thz field @xmath250 , experiments @xcite indicate that @xmath249 are actually stronger in domain 1 than in domains 2 and 3 .",
    "as mentioned above , we have used a smaller value of @xmath32 than warranted by the observed , weak fm moment @xmath89 of the af phase . for magnetic field along a cubic axis , @xmath96 mev corresponds to the zero - field intercept @xmath253 , smaller than the intercepts @xmath254 and @xmath255 obtained by tokunaga _",
    "_ @xcite and park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "our value @xmath256 for the cycloidal spin amplitude parallel to @xmath31 is roughly half what ramazanoglu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite estimated from elastic neutron - scattering measurements .",
    "recall that the weak fm moment of the af phase is predicted @xcite to be @xmath257 .",
    "a larger value for @xmath32 requires a commensurately larger value for the anisotropy @xmath28 to preserve the same zero - field splittings of @xmath258 and @xmath259 produced by the anharmonicity of the cycloid .",
    "for example , when @xmath260 and @xmath261 mev , the best fits to the zero - field frequencies are obtained with @xmath262 mev . in comparison with the zero - field tilt angle @xmath263",
    "when @xmath256 , @xmath264 when @xmath265 .",
    "earlier work @xcite found that the matrix elements @xmath210 and @xmath209 of the tilt - activated modes @xmath160 and @xmath161 ( @xmath176 @xmath27 ) scale like @xmath266 in zero field .",
    "so the intensities @xmath267 of @xmath160 and @xmath161 are larger by a factor of @xmath268 for @xmath260 than for @xmath256 . but larger @xmath32 and @xmath28 do not resolve the most serious discrepancies between the predicted and measured intensities in zero field .",
    "in particular , they do not generate nonzero matrix elements @xmath210 for the in - plane @xmath249 modes or for the out - of - plane @xmath162 mode at @xmath91 .",
    "another set of weak interactions may possibly explain the enhanced spectroscopic intensities .",
    "there are at least two candidates for such interactions .",
    "the small rhombohedral distortion @xcite ( @xmath269 ) of will change the next - nearest neighbor exchange @xmath61 within each hexagonal plane compared to the interaction between different planes . due to magnetoelastic coupling ,",
    "easy - plane anisotropy perpendicular to @xmath31 may compete with the @xmath32 interaction , permitting much larger values for @xmath32 consistent with the observed moment @xmath89 of the af phase .",
    "either set of additional interactions may modify the md matrix elements and change the spectroscopic intensities of the activated modes .    to conclude , the spectroscopic frequencies and intensities provide very sensitive probes of the weak microscopic interactions that control the cycloid and induced polarization in .",
    "we are confident that future work based on the model presented in this paper will lay the groundwork for the eventual technological applications of this important material .",
