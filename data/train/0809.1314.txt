    "@xcite the classical ` rockets - and - string '  @xcite and ` pole - and - barn '  @xcite paradoxes of special relativity were re - analysed taking into account the distinction between the real and apparent positions of uniformly moving objects .",
    "different results were obtained from those of the usual text - book interpretations of these experiments and a new causality - violating paradox was pointed out .",
    "this paradox , as well as the related ` backwards running clocks ' one of soni  @xcite , was resolved in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in order to avoid these paradoxes as well as manifest breakdown of translational invariance , in some applications of the standard space - time lorentz transformation , the use of a ` local ' lorentz transformation .",
    "i.e. one where the transformed event in the moving frame lies at the coordinate origin in this frame , was advocated . when this is done the closely correlated ` relativity of simultaneity ' ( rs ) and ` length contraction ' ( lc )",
    "effects of conventional special relativity theory do not occur .",
    "the connection between these effects is explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite also contains a ` mini review ' of all experimental tests of special relativity where it is pointed out that , whereas time dilatation is well - confirmed experimentally , no experimental evidence exists for the rs and lc effects . in the later papers  @xcite it is explained how the spurious rs and lc effects result from a misuse of the time symbols in the standard space - time lorentz transformation . refs .",
    "@xcite present the argument in a pedagogical manner , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite contains a concise summary of it .    in the following section the necessary formulae for the analysis of the muon decay thought experiment essentially the prediction of a universal time dilatation effect",
    "are derived from first principles .",
    "here there is considerable overlap with work presented in refs .",
    "@xcite the analysis of the thought experiment presented in section 3 shows the absence of the spurious text - book rs effect : muons which decay simultaneously in a common proper frame , are observed to do so in all inertial frames .",
    "finally the results of the analysis presented in this paper are used to shed light on the physical basis of the differential aging effect in the travelling - twin thought experiment  @xcite .",
    "the lorentz transformation ( lt ) relates observations ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 ) of the coordinates of space - time events in one inertial frame s , to observations of the coordinates ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7 ) of the same events in another inertial frame s. as is conventional , the cartesian spatial coordinate axes of the two frames are parallel , and the origin of the frame s moves with constant speed , @xmath8 , along the @xmath0-axis . in any actual experiment ,",
    "times are recorded by clocks , and positions specified by marks on fixed rulers ( or their equivalent ) .",
    "therefore , in order to relate the space - time coordinates appearing in the lt to actual physical measurements they must be identified with clock readings and length interval measurements  @xcite .",
    "this can be done in two distinct ways depending on whether the experimenter observing the clocks and performing the length measurements is at rest in s or in s. in the former case ( only events with spatial coordinates along the @xmath0-axis are considered so that @xmath1 = @xmath5 = @xmath2 = @xmath6 = @xmath9 ) the appropriate lt , for a clock , c , situated at the origin of s , is : @xmath10 = 0 \\\\   t ' & = & \\gamma_v[\\tau-\\frac{\\beta_v x({{\\rm c}}')}{c}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and in the latter case , for a clock , c , situated at the origin of s , is : @xmath11 = 0 \\\\   t & = & \\gamma_v[\\tau'+\\frac{\\beta_v x'({{\\rm c}})}{c } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these equations @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the clocks in s and s are synchronised so that for ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) , @xmath15 when @xmath16 , and for ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) , @xmath17 when @xmath16 . in ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) the transformed events lie on the worldline of a clock , c , at rest in s , which is observed from s. the observed time in s registered by c ( which is in motion in this frame ) is @xmath7 , while @xmath18 is the time registered by the clock , c , identical to c , but at rest in s. in contrast , in ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) the transformed events lie on the worldline of c , which is observed from s. the time @xmath3 is that registered by c as observed from s and @xmath19 is the time registered by c as observed in its own proper frame .",
    "thus two distinct experiments are possible involving one stationary and one moving clock , depending on whether the experimenter performing the space and time measurements is in the rest frame of one , or the other , of the two clocks . to describe both of these experiments , four different time symbols , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 , with different operational meanings , are required .    from ( 2.1 ) , the equation of motion of c in s is : @xmath20 while from ( 2.3 ) the equation of motion of c in s is : @xmath21 using ( 2.5 ) to eliminate @xmath0 from ( 2.2 ) , and in view of the definition of @xmath22 : @xmath23 similarly , using ( 2.6 ) to eliminate @xmath4 from ( 2.4 ) gives : @xmath24 ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) are expressions of the relativistic time dilatation ( td ) effect in the two ` reciprocal ' experiments that may be performed using the clocks c and c. they show that , according , to the lt , ` moving clocks run slow ' in a universal manner ( no spatial coordinates appear in ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) ) . in fact : @xmath25    to discuss measurements of the spatial separations of moving clocks , at least two clocks , ( say , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , at rest in s ) must be considered .",
    "it is assumed that they lie along the @xmath4-axis separated by the distance @xmath28 , @xmath26 being at the origin of s and @xmath27 at @xmath29 .",
    "the space transformation equations analogous to ( 2.1 ) for @xmath26 and @xmath27 and are then : @xmath30 = 0 \\\\    x'({{\\rm c}'_{b}})-l ' & = & \\gamma_v[x({{\\rm c}'_{b}})-l - v\\tau ] = 0    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inspection of ( 2.11 ) shows that @xmath31 , a relation valid for all values of @xmath8 for the choice of coordinate systems in ( 2.10 ) and ( 2.11 ) . in particular , it is valid when @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . then for @xmath35 :",
    "@xmath36 so that @xmath37 the spatial separation of the clocks is therefore a lorentz - invariant quantity .",
    "suppose now that two objects move with speeds @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) along the positive @xmath0-axis in s and that they are coincident with the origins of s and s at the time @xmath41 . at later times",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath7 , the separation of the objects in s is @xmath42 and in s is @xmath43 . where @xmath44 is the relative velocity of the objects in s. in view of ( 2.13 ) and the time dilatation formula ( 2.7 ) it follows that @xmath45 a particular case of ( 2.14 ) , to be used in the following section , is @xmath46 , @xmath47 giving @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the observed speed of the origin of s along the negative @xmath0-axis in s  .",
    "the relation ( 2.14 ) is the transformation formula of the _ relative velocity _ of two objects between two inertial frames , to be contrasted with the relativistic parallel velocity addition formula : @xmath50 which relates kinematical configurations of a single moving object in the frames s and s. in the case @xmath51 , ( 2.16 ) gives @xmath52 and this equation relates the kinematical configuration in s in the primary experiment described by ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) to that in s in the ( physically independent ) reciprocal experiment described by ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) .",
    "in contrast ( 2.14 ) describes the observed _ relative velocity transformation _ within the primary experiment . for further discussion of this important point see refs .",
    "muon decays constitute an excellent laboratory for testing the predictions of special relativity .",
    "for example , the td effect of eqn(2.7 ) was experimentally confirmed at the per mille level of relative precision in the ultrarelativisic domain ( @xmath53 ) by observation of the decay of muons in the storage ring of the last cern muon @xmath54 experiment  @xcite . in the present paper , it is shown that thought experiments involving muons provide a graphic illustration of the predicted space - time behaviour , in special relativity , of clocks in different inertial frames .    unlike most other unstable particles , muons are particularly suitable for precise tests of the td effect because of the ease of their production from pion decay and their long mean lifetime of 2.2 @xmath55s .",
    "the former yields high events statistics and the latter the possibility of precise time interval measurements using accurate clocks in the laboratory frame  @xcite .",
    "the thought experiment developed in the present paper is an elaboration of the well - known demonstration that the very presence of cosmic muons at the earth s surface is , by itself , sufficient to demonstrate the existence of the td effect  @xcite .",
    "muons are produced predominantly by the weak decay of charged pions @xmath56 .",
    "the velocity of the muon , @xmath57 , depends upon that of the parent pion , @xmath58 , and the centre - of - mass decay angle , @xmath59 .",
    "if the pion has the same velocity , @xmath60 , as the muon in the pion rest frame , ( corresponding to a pion momentum of 49.5 mev / c ) and @xmath61 , the muon is produced at rest in the laboratory system .",
    "the maximum muon decay energy @xmath62 correponds to @xmath63 and is given , in terms of the parent pion energy @xmath64 , and the pion velocity @xmath65 , by the relation : @xmath66}{2 m_{\\pi}^2}\\ ] ]      due to the thickness of the earth s atmosphere , the majority of interactions of primary cosmic protons , that produce the parent pions of cosmic muons , occur at high altitude , @xmath69 20 km above the earth s surface .",
    "a muon with speed close to that of light then takes at least @xmath69 700 @xmath70 to reach the surface of the earth .",
    "this may be compared with the muon mean lifetime of 2.2 @xmath70 . without the td effect , only a fraction @xmath71 \\simeq 10^{-138}$ ] of the muons produced at altitude",
    "would reach the earth s surface .",
    "however a 10 gev muon , which has @xmath72 , has a 3.5 @xmath73 probability to reach the earth s surface , before decaying , when the td effect is taken into account .    in the thought experiment considered here",
    "it is assumed that two muons @xmath74 and @xmath75 are produced simultaneously at the same point a ( see fig.1a ) by decay of pions from a primary cosmic ray interaction with the nucleus of a gas atom in the atmosphere .",
    "the muon @xmath74 is produced at rest in the atmosphere ( inertial frame s ) while @xmath75 ( with proper frame s ) is produced with velocity @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 .",
    "it happens that both muons decay after time @xmath78 in their proper frames .",
    "because of the td effect , the muon @xmath75 will then be seen by an observer at rest in the atmosphere to decay after time @xmath79 at a point b at a distance @xmath80 km from a. it is also supposed that at the same time , @xmath41 , that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are created , another muon , @xmath81 , ( also with proper decay lifetime @xmath78 ) is created at rest in the atmosphere at the point b , by decay of pion from another primary cosmic ray interaction .",
    "since @xmath74 and @xmath81 are at rest in the atmosphere and have no td effect , they will decay simultaneously at @xmath82 ( fig.1b ) in the frame s. at this instant the muon @xmath75 is still undecayed and is at the point m , midway between a and b , when @xmath75 decays ( fig.1c ) @xmath74 and @xmath81 no longer exist , however the centres of mass of their , by now distant , decay products @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , denoted as ( @xmath74 ) and ( @xmath81 ) , and indicated in figs .",
    "1 - 3 as two concentric circles , still remain at the points a and b.    the sequence of events that would be seen by an observer in the rest frame , s, of @xmath75 corresponding to those of fig.1 , is shown in fig.2 . according to the relative velocity transformation formula ( 2.15 ) , @xmath74 and @xmath81 are observed to move to the left with velocity @xmath86 .",
    "the configuration at @xmath87 is shown in fig.2a . according to the time dilatation relation ( 2.7 ) , appropriate to this case , @xmath74 and @xmath81",
    "are seen to decay simultaneously at time @xmath88 ( fig.2b ) . as in fig.1",
    ", it can be sees that @xmath75 is aligned with m , the mid point of the line segment ab , at the time of simultaneous decay of @xmath74 and as shown in fig.2c , @xmath75 decays at time @xmath89 , when it is aligned with b , as is also the case for an observer in the frame s , as shown in fig.1c . since @xmath74 and @xmath81 are seen to decay simultaneously by observers at rest in both s and s , there is no rs effect .",
    "the sequence of events that would be observed in the frame s  , moving with velocity @xmath90 in the positive @xmath0-direction will now be considered .",
    "according to the relative velocity transformation formula ( 2.14 ) , @xmath75 is observed to move with speed @xmath91 in the positive @xmath0-direction in s  since the _ relative velocity _ of s  and s in the frame s is @xmath92 .",
    "also , according to ( 2.15 ) , @xmath74 and @xmath81 are observed to move with speed @xmath93 in the negative @xmath0-direction in s  .",
    "the velocity of @xmath75 relative to @xmath74 and @xmath81 in the frame s  is then @xmath94 .",
    "the sequence of events seem by an observer at rest in s  is illustrated , for the case @xmath95 , in fig.3 . using the time dilatation realation ( 2.7 ) , with @xmath8 set equal to @xmath90 in order to relate times in s and s  , @xmath74 and @xmath81 decay at time @xmath96 , when @xmath75 is aligned with m ( see fig.3b ) .",
    "note that the time of this event in s",
    " depends only on the value of @xmath90 , being independent of the value of @xmath8 .",
    "the muon @xmath75 decays at time @xmath97 when it is aligned with b ( see fig.3c ) .",
    "in all three frames , s , s and s  , @xmath74 and @xmath81 are observed to decay simultaneously and earlier than @xmath75 .",
    "these decay times , in each frame , are presented in table 1 .",
    "the entries in this table satisfy the following condition : @xmath98 since the last member of this equation is independent of @xmath90 , it follows that ratio of the decay times given by the time dilatation relation ( 2.7 ) is the same for all inertial observers , and so is an invariant , fixed by the velocity of @xmath75 in the rest frame of @xmath74 where the time dilatation effect is defined i.e .",
    "observer at rest in s , observed muon at rest in s.    different ( but reciprocal , i.e. related to those of eqn(3.2 ) by exchange of primed and unprimed quantities ) results would be obtained in the situation where the observer of the time dilatation effect is at rest in s , while the observed muon is a rest in s , so that the reciprocal time dilatation relation ( 2.8 ) is applicable .",
    "inspection of , and reflection on , figs.1 and 2 reveals the physical basis of the differential aging effect in the ` twin paradox ' introduced by langevin  @xcite . the `",
    "travelling twin ' can be indentified with @xmath75 , the ` stay at home ' one with either @xmath74 or @xmath81 since their associated ` clocks ' are synchronous . at the end of the outward journey ,",
    "when @xmath75 arrives at b , the synchronous clocks at a and b were seen in s to run twice as fast as that of @xmath75 in fact @xmath74 and @xmath81 have already decayed when @xmath75 arrives at b. in fig.1 , the observer in s sees @xmath75 aging less rapidly than @xmath74 or @xmath81 .",
    "however , as required by the time dilatation relation ( 2.7 ) , an observer in s ( fig.2 ) sees @xmath74 or @xmath81 _ aging more rapidly _",
    ", by a factor two , than @xmath75 .",
    "this is true even though these clocks are in motion relative to the observer on s. fig.2 also reveals that the physical basis of time dilatation , and differential aging , is not , as hitherto , to be found in ` length contraction ' in the frame s , but instead in the greater velocity of @xmath74 or @xmath81 relative to @xmath75 in the ` travelling frame ' s , than that of @xmath75 relative to @xmath74 or @xmath81 in the ` base frame ' s from which the time dilatation effect is observed . for futher discussion of base and travelling frames in relation to primary and reciprocal space - time experiments",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the much - discussed ` twin paradox ' arises when it is attempted to describe the sequence of events shown in fig.2 by use of the time dilatation relation ( 2.8 ) of the reciprocal experiment which requires clocks in s to run slower ( not faster , as in fig.2 ) than those in s , when observed in the latter frame .",
    "this is a nonsensical interpretation since the time variables @xmath18 and @xmath7 appearing in the time dilatation relation ( 2.7 ) have a completely different operational meaning to those , @xmath19 and @xmath3 in the time dilatation relation of the reciprocal experiment .",
