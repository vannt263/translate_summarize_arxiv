    "photons , real or virtual , are known to be clean probes of the internal structure of the nucleon . in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , the cross sections for absorption of highly - virtual photons were the first to reveal the internal quark structure of nucleons .",
    "the parton distributions extracted from these cross sections contain important structural information and seriously challenge our understanding nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "elastic absorption of virtual photons can be used to measure the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon . at low virtuality ,",
    "these form factors give us direct information about the sizes and magnetic moments of nucleons . at high virtuality , they are sensitive to the leading - twist light - cone wavefunctions . more recently",

    "one of us introduced deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) as a probe to a novel class of  off - forward \" parton distributions ( ofpd s ) @xcite .",
    "dvcs is a process in which a highly virtual photon ( with virtuality @xmath1 ) scatters on a nucleon target ( polarized or unpolarized ) , producing an exclusive final state consisting of a high - energy real photon and a slightly recoiled nucleon . with the virtual photon in the bjorken limit",
    ", a qcd analysis shows that the scattering is dominated by the simple mechanism in which a quark ( antiquark ) in the initial nucleon absorbs the virtual photon , immediately radiates a real one , and falls back to form the recoiled nucleon .",
    "several interesting theoretical papers have since appeared in the literature , which studied the dvcs process further . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the single - quark scattering was recalculated using a different , but equivalent definition of the parton distributions .",
    "the evolution equations of the distributions were derived and some general aspects of factorization were discussed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the evolution equations for ofpd s were derived and the leading - twist dvcs cross sections were calculated at order @xmath2 . some past and recent studies of ofpd s can be found in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , estimates of these cross sections were made at compass and tjnaf energies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dvcs process was considered as a limit of unequal mass compton scattering , which was studied from the point of view of the operator product expansion .",
    "some early studies of unequal mass compton processes can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a number of suggestions were made to test the leading twist dominance in dvcs at finite @xmath3 . in a rapid communication paper ,",
    "the present authors studied @xmath4 corrections to dvcs for the parton helicity - independent case@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the same issue was investigated from different perspectives .",
    "the present paper is an expanded presentation of our results in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main motivation for the present study is to see if the theoretical basis for the dvcs process is up to par with other well - known perturbative qcd processes .",
    "more explicitly , we discuss the existence of a factorization theorem for this process . for general two virtual photon processes in the bjorken limit , the factorizability is suggested by studies of deep inelastic scattering . in the case of dvcs , where one of the photons is onshell , the situation could be different .",
    "potential infrared problems can arise because of the additional light - like vector in this special kinematic limit .",
    "however , it is believed that these complications will not ruin the factorization properties @xcite .",
    "to see factorization at work , it is instructive to work out one - loop examples .",
    "we will do this explicitly in section iii . for consistency",
    ", we consider the unphysical process of dvcs on onshell quark and gluon `` targets . '' to ensure gauge invariance , we regularize the infrared divergences by going to @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "for completeness we have considered both the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the amplitudes , which are related to helicity - independent and dependent parton distributions , respectively .",
    "the only omission is the gluon helicity flip amplitude , which will be discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "as expected , our result contains collinear infrared divergences which can be interpreted as the one - loop perturbative parton distributions , as we will show in section iv .",
    "this property is independent of the special kinematic limit of dvcs .    a general proof of the dvcs factorization was first given by radyushkin in his approach based on @xmath6-representation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we give an alternative proof using the tools developed by libby , sterman , collins and others @xcite . according to these",
    ", one can represent the infrared sensitive contributions in a generic feynman diagram with reduced diagrams .",
    "these reduced diagrams have intuitive physical significance and are easy to identify .",
    "general power counting rules can be used to select leading reduced diagrams in a process .",
    "a recent application of the method can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we show in section v that the leading reduced diagrams for dvcs do not contain any soft divergences and are in fact exactly the same as those present when the final state photon is deeply virtual .",
    "the collinear divergences in the reduced diagrams can be attributed to those of ofpd s when calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore we conclude that factorization for dvcs is in the same footing as other well - known examples like deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the factorization property of the general two virtual photon process can be summarized beautifully in terms of wilson s operator product expansion .",
    "this expansion requires operators with total derivatives @xcite to describe the off - forward nature of the process .",
    "it is well - known that these derivative operators contribute to the wavefunctions of mesons @xcite . in section",
    "vi , we convert our one - loop results into wilson coefficients of the twist - two operators in the @xmath7 scheme . together with the two - loop anomolous dimensions of these operators , they provide the necessary ingredients for calculating dvcs at the next - to - leading order .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section vii .",
    "although our ultimate interest is in deeply virtual compton scattering , we start by considering a general compton process involving two offshell photons with different virtualities",
    ". this and a suitable choice of kinematic variables allows us to exploit the full symmetry of the problem . in the general compton process",
    ", a virtual photon of momentum @xmath8 is absorbed by a hadron of momentum @xmath9 , which then emitts a virtual photon with momentum @xmath10 and recoils with momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the three independent external momenta can be expanded in terms of the light - cone vectors @xmath12 where the 3-direction is chosen as the direction of the average hadron momentum ( @xmath13 ) , and two transverse vectors . in an expansion , we call the coefficient of @xmath14 the + component and that of @xmath15 the @xmath16 component",
    ". thus we write @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hadron mass ( which is taken to be the same for the initial and final hadrons ) , @xmath19 , @xmath3 is the virtuality of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a measure of the difference of the virtualities of the two external photons , @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a vector in the transverse directions which has squared length @xmath25 .",
    "we have also introduced @xmath26 , the analogue of the bjorken scaling variable in this off - forward process .",
    "we note that these expressions limit the range of @xmath21 to @xmath27 for fixed @xmath28 , or the range of @xmath28 to @xmath29 for fixed @xmath21 .    in the bjorken limit , these expressions simplify considerably .",
    "since we consider only the leading twist in this paper , we may neglect all but the @xmath30 components of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( in order to form large scalars , one must dot the @xmath30 component of a vector with the @xmath16 component of @xmath33 ) .",
    "hence , in the limit @xmath34 ( @xmath28 remaining finite ) , we may write @xmath35 here , we note that the external invariants have been reduced from six to three by enforcing kinematics and taking the bjorken limit .",
    "we express these three scalars in terms of one mass scale , @xmath3 , and two dimensionless parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath21 .",
    "when we introduce the parton distributions , our expressions will also involve the parton light - cone momentum variable @xmath37 .",

    "the simplest feynman diagram for this process is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where a quark comes out of the nucleon blob , scatters , and rejoins the nucleon blob . while the scattering involves a large momentum transfer and can be calculated in perturbation theory , the nucleon blob with two quark legs is related to the baryon structure and is nonperturbative . for more complicated graphs , as will be discussed throughout this paper , the compton amplitude can be separated analogously into soft and hard contributions . in the remainder of this section , we will highlight some important aspects of the soft part .",

    "we have also suppressed the @xmath28 dependence because it will not affect most of the discussions in this paper .    at next to leading order , gluons also contribute to the compton process .",
    "although it is nontrivial to show , the twist - two gluon distributions are contained in the following gauge - invariant light - cone correlations ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 where the ellipses denote higher twist contributions and an additional twist - two term which involves gluon helicity flip and will not be considered in this paper @xcite .",

    "the gauge link is just the unit operator in the adjoint representation and field strength tensors with one + index @xmath59 simplify to @xmath60 .",

    "an alternative choice is offered by chanowitz , furman , and hinchcliffe @xcite , which employs the usual four - dimensional rules @xmath70 the ambiguity in the second equation does not affect calculations as long as there are no anomalies in the problem . in the case that there is an anomaly , the ambiguity can be fixed by imposing the relevant ward identities .",

    "in this section , we present a one - loop calculation of the general compton scattering on onshell quark and gluon `` targets '' in the bjorken limit .",

    "half of these diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "the other half will be taken into account by using the crossing symmetry , i.e. , the simultaneous replacement of @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the terms with @xmath77 in the following formulas reflect this contribution . because of time reversal invariance , the compton amplitude is also an even function of @xmath21 , i.e. , symmetric under @xmath78 .",
    "this symmetry relates the left and right vertex diagrams ( figs .",

    "this indicates that factorization holds for two - photon amplitudes even when one of the photons is onshell .",
    "we will argue in the next section that the above formula , one of the main results of this paper , remains valid to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "in this section , we generalize the one - loop result of the previous section , showing that the factorization formula eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) is valid in the dvcs limit to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the one - loop result indicates that all soft divergences - those associated with integration regions where all components of some internal momenta are zero - cancel , whereas all collinear divergences can be factorized into the off - forward parton distributions . to see that this happens also at higher orders in perturbation theory ,",
    "it is important to understand how the soft cancellation happens in the simplest case .",
    "the self - energy diagram in fig .",
    "2b does not contain any infrared divergences because the intermediate quark is far offshell .",
    "the vertex corrections in figs . 2c and 2d",
    "potentially have infrared divergences , but a simple power counting indicates that these diagrams are in fact infrared convergent .",
    "thus infared divergences appear only in the box diagram . in the region where the gluon momentum @xmath145 is soft",
    ", we can approximate the integral as @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the momenta of the two external quark lines . on the other hand ,",
    "the wave function renormalization of an `` on - shell '' quark , @xmath79 , also contains infrared divergences .",
    "grouping these divergent terms together , we have the entire soft contribution @xmath149 in the collinear approximation , @xmath148 is proportional to @xmath147 and thus the above integral vanishes .    for higher - order feynman diagrams ,",
    "a systematic method of identifying , regrouping and factorizing infrared - sensitive contributions has been developed by libby , sterman , collins , and others @xcite .",
    "the method essentially consists of the following steps : 1 ) simplify the feynman integrals by setting all the soft scales to zero , including the quark masses ; 2 ) identify the regions of loop integration which give rise to infrared divergences ; 3 ) use infrared power counting to find the leading infrared - divergent regions ; 4 ) show that all soft and collinear divergences either cancel or factorize into some nonperturbative quantities . in the remainder of this section , we examine the validity of the factorization formula eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) in the limit of @xmath150 following the above steps .    in dvcs ,",
    "the leading contributions come essentially from a massless collinear process in which the external momenta take the form shown in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . in this simplified kinematic region ,",
    "all infrared - sensitive contributions appear as @xmath123 poles in dimensional regularization .",
    "if a contribution contains no infrared divergences , it comes from regions of loop momenta comparable to the hard scale @xmath3 , and thus it is insensitive to the soft scales .",
    "an infrared divergent contribution must come from the integration regions where some internal propagators are near their mass shells .",
    "since such soft contributions can not be calculated reliably in perturbative qcd and eventually must be taken into account with nonperturbative matrix elements , one can use any valid infrared regulator to characterize them in perturbative calculations .",
    "thus the collinear massless limit helps to simplify the identification of soft contributions while leaving the truly - perturbative contributions intact .",
    "infrared divergences appear in a feynman diagram when some of the external momenta are onshell .",
    "the regions of integration producing such contributions can be identified from the landau equations which are derived by considering the analytical properties of the diagrams as functions of complex external momenta . according to coleman and norton @xcite",
    ", these regions can be represented by the so - called reduced diagrams in which offshell lines are shrunk to points and onshell lines are drawn according to their real space - time propagation .",
    "we shall argue below that the general _ leading _ reduced diagram for dvcs is the one shown in fig .",
    "5a , in which an incoming virtual photon and an outgoing real one are attached to the hard interaction blob , which in turn is connected to the forward nucleon jet with two collinear quark lines or two physically polarized gluon lines , plus an arbitrary number of longitudinally - polarized collinear gluon lines .",
    "[ fig5 ]    to decide that a reduced diagram is leading , one can use infrared power counting @xcite , which is essentially a light - cone dimensional analysis @xcite . a simple way to proceed",
    "is to consider the mass dimensions of the soft vertices that connect lines with either collinear or soft momenta .",
    "since the dimension of an amplitude is fixed , all soft mass dimensions must be compensated by the hard scale @xmath3 .",
    "assuming covariant normalization for the external states ( @xmath151 ) , every external wave function contributes mass dimension @xmath152 .",
    "the collinear quarks and gluons into a soft hadron vertex have effective mass dimensions depending on their polarizations .",
    "a dirac field @xmath153 can be written as a sum of good ( @xmath154 ) and bad ( @xmath155 ) components , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the good ( bad ) component has effective light - cone mass dimension @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "a vector potential @xmath160 has light - cone components @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , which have effective mass dimensions 0 , 1 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "for the reduced diagram shown in fig .",
    "5a , the only soft mass dimension comes from the nucleon - quark - gluon blob . using the above rule",
    ", we find it is 0 [ @xmath164(physical parton lines @xmath165 ( external nucleon states ) ] . because @xmath86 is dimensionless , the leading reduced diagram contributes at order @xmath166 .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the leading region is independent of the virtuality of the final state photon as long as the initial photon is deeply virtual .",
    "when the final state photon is real , it can have pointlike coupling to quarks as well as extended coupling via its soft wave function , as happens in the case of vector dominance .",
    "thus one has an additional reduced diagram in which a jet of quarks and gluons emerges in the @xmath15 direction and combines into a real photon long after the hard scattering ( fig 5b ) .",
    "such a reduced diagram has already been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and is @xmath167 by infrared power counting .",
    "indeed , according to the discussion in the previous paragraph , the photon wave function vertex has a soft mass dimension @xmath168 ( quark lines ) @xmath169 ( photon state ) ( recall the dimensionful pion decay constant @xmath170 ) . a negative hard power @xmath171 is needed in @xmath86 to balance it out .",
    "the power counting involving soft quark and gluon lines is more subtle , and some discussion may be found in ref .",
    "the result is that any reduced diagram with soft lines connecting the hard scattering blob to the nucleon jet is subleading ( fig .",
    "the situation here is exactly analogous to the case of forward virtual compton scattering relevant to deep - inelastic scattering as discussed , for instance , by sterman @xcite .",
    "a simple example is the vertex correction diagram we already discussed above .",
    "when the gluon becomes soft , it has a reduced diagram like fig .",
    "5c . however , it has no contribution at leading power .",
    "we now come back to the leading reduced diagram shown in fig .",
    "5a . the collinear gluons with longitudinal polarization",
    "connect the hard scattering part and the nucleon jets .",
    "these collinear gluons can be factorized using the generalized ward identities as described in ref .",
    "eventually , all collinear gluons can effectively be attached to an eikonal line in the light - cone direction conjuate to the nucleon jet , @xmath15 .",
    "physically , this means that as far as the collinear gluons are concerned , the hard interaction part acts as a jet of particles propagating along @xmath15 . the internal structure of the hard interaction can not be resolved and thus only the total color charge and momentum of the jet is relevant .",
    "the eikonal line together with the physical quarks and gluons and the nucleon jets form the off - forward parton distributions defined in section ii . in the hard scattering ,",
    "only the total momentum and charge supplied by collinear partons are important .",
    "thus , one can calculate it with incoming physical partons carrying the total momentum and charge of all the collinear longitudinally - polarized gluons . in this way",
    ", we have a complete factorization of the soft and hard physics in the dvcs process .",
    "the factorization formula in eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) for the general compton scattering process can also be examined in the form of an operator product expansion .",
    "the ope was first introduced by wilson @xcite in 1969 and has been used extensively in deep inelastic scattering and other perturbative qcd processes . for the product of two currents separated near the light - cone ,",
    "the expansion is threefold .",
    "primarily , it is a twist expansion , in which twist - two contributions are leading whereas the higher twist terms are suppressed by powers of @xmath172 .",
    "each term in the twist expansion contains an infinite number of local operators of the relevant twist .",
    "this may be thought of as a kind of taylor expansion of bilocal operators along the light - cone .",
    "finally , the coefficients of local operators ( wilson coefficients ) are themselves expansions in the strong coupling constant .",
    "the wilson coefficients for the unpolarized dis process were calculated at order @xmath118 in the @xmath7 scheme in @xcite . for the polarized case , one can find them in @xcite .",
    "when considering off - forward processes , the expansion of an operator product must include operators with total derivatives .",
    "we call this expansion the generalized ope . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we will recast our factorization formula in its generalized ope form . in the process",
    ", we identify these total derivative operators and obtain their wilson coefficients to next - to - leading order in @xmath118 .",
    "the final result agrees with the known ope in the dis limit ( @xmath173 ) .    to derive the generalized ope",
    ", we expand @xmath174 in a power series about @xmath175 . in this way",
    ", we can express the amplitude in terms of moments of the parton disributions rather than the distributions themselves .",
    "eventually , we will relate the moments of parton distributions to the matrix elements of local operators .",

    "this result is not immediately obvious because of the @xmath179 denominators in the amplitudes . in the case of the gluon distribution functions",
    ", we have an additional factor of @xmath179 in the denominator .",
    "since the final ope contains only local operators , these factors have to be cancelled in the process of expansion .",
    "indeed , this turns out to be the case and we obtain the coefficients of the positive moments of the gluon distributions @xmath180    having obtained an expansion involving the moments of the distributions , we move toward a general form of the ope . to this end",
    ", we consider the moments of the parton distributions .",
    "we begin by observing that for quarks @xmath181 holds in light - cone gauge , where we have defined @xmath182 .",
    "the parton distribution depends on @xmath37 only through the exponential , which allows one to integrate over the @xmath37 through simple partial integrations .",
    "the @xmath183 integration can then be done trivially .",
    "so the moments of the quark distribution can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements of local operators in the light - cone gauge .",
    "however , in this gauge , these gauge - dependent local operators are equal to the gauge invariant operators obtained by replacing the partial derivatives in the above expression by covariant derivatives , @xmath184 where @xmath185 signifies that the indices are symmetrized and the trace has been removed .",
    "thus the moments of the quark distribution functions are just matrix elements of the + components of the above operators between the initial and final hadron states .",
    "we also recognize that @xmath186 this prompts us to define @xmath187 after replacing the moments of parton distributions in eq.([ope ] ) with matrix elements of these operators and interpreting the result as an operator relation , we find the following generalized ope , @xmath188 it must be pointed out that the generalized ope does not have a unique form .",
    "one can define @xmath36 as any dimensionless invariant formed from the external momenta which remains finite in the bjorken limit and expand the amplitude in inverse powers of this variable .",
    "this will lead to a different set of coefficient functions , but the physical content is the same .",
    "the choice of which ope to use is determined by the specifics of the problem at hand .",
    "of course , the above expression contains only the contributions to leading order in @xmath172 .",
    "since the operators @xmath189 are symmetrized and traceless , their rank is @xmath190 .",
    "the mass dimension of these operators is just the dimension of the fermion fields plus that of the derivatives , or @xmath191 .",
    "hence these operators are all twist 2 . at the next order in @xmath172 one",
    "has to consider operators of higher twist , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the qcd factorization for deeply virtual compton scattering explicitly at one loop and then to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "our conclusion is that dvcs is factorizable in perturbation theory .",
    "this statement has the same level of rigor as the ordinary operator production expansion used in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "in fact , assuming the generalized ope with total derivative operators , dvcs can be recovered by analytically continue @xmath36 variable from @xmath192 region to the point @xmath150 .",
    "the factorization theorem guarantees that the compton amplitudes are finite there , although the one - loop calculation indicates that they are not analytic .",
    "we have also computed the coefficient functions to order @xmath118 for the generalized ope including the total derivative operators . for general two photon processes , one has to include the longitudinal photon scattering , which has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and photon - helictity flip amplitude @xcite . the scale evolution of total derivative operators can best be studied using conformally - symmetric operators @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been known for a long time that at the leading - log level , the operators of same twist and dimension evolve multiplicatively in gegenbauer polynomial combinations .",
    "it is a simple excercise to transform eq .",
