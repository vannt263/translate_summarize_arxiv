    "the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) sample of high - redshift clusters of galaxies serendipitously discovered in the fields of _ einstein _ imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) images ( gioia 1990 ; henry 1992 ) has proved to be useful for testing cosmological models ( henry 1997 ; eke 1998 ; donahue 1998 ) .",
    "it was the first x - ray survey with significant numbers of clusters at @xmath16 .",
    "even now , the emss stands unique among cluster surveys . because of its large sky coverage and moderately deep x - ray sensitivity , it is the only survey with a full suite of spectroscopic redshifts that can begin to place constraints on the evolution of the rarest and most luminous clusters of galaxies .",
    "these are the clusters which are expected to evolve the most dramatically in models of structure formation driven by gravitational collapse .",
    "the only survey similar in size and depth is the rosat serendipitous survey by vikhlinin ( 1998 ) , containing 200 galaxy clusters with a mixture of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the clusters we have studied from the emss are at moderately high redshift ( @xmath17 ) and high x - ray luminosities ( @xmath18 ) , and thus are the clusters most likely to show evidence for evolution , if cluster evolution occurs .",
    "the original luminosity functions derived from the emss suggested that the highest luminosity clusters @xmath19 may be somewhat less common at the highest redshifts ( gioia 1990 ; henry 1992 ) .",
    "more recently , deeper x - ray surveys with more sophisticated cluster detection algorithms but less sky coverage ( e.g. , rosati 1998 ; jones 1998 ) showed little evolution for cluster luminosities @xmath20 .",
    "followup x - ray observations of the emss clusters with asca and rosat to acquire temperatures and emitting volumes of the intracluster gas ( donahue 1996 ; donahue 1998 ; furuzawa 1994 ; yamashita 1994 ) along with ground - based measurements of their galaxy velocity dispersion ( carlberg 1996 ; donahue 1996 ; donahue 1998 ) have shown that these clusters contain hot intracluster media and correspondingly high velocity dispersions characteristic of massive clusters .",
    "in addition , the weak lensing signatures of these clusters corroborate the large mass estimates derived from their x - ray temperatures and galaxy kinematics ( luppino & gioia 1995 ; luppino & kaiser 1996 ) .",
    "the temperature function of massive distant clusters strongly constrains cosmological models because cluster temperatures are closely related to cluster masses whose evolution with redshift is quite sensitive to cosmological parameters .",
    "gravitational compression is the dominant source of heating of the intracluster medium ( icm ) of massive clusters .",
    "while the icm of smaller clusters ( @xmath21  kev ) may be significantly modified by the effects of superwinds or other energetic processes , the gravitational energy per particle in larger clusters is several times the thermal energy per particle available through supernovae ( e.g. , renzini 1993 ) .",
    "because the temperatures of clusters reflect their virial masses , a compilation of the cluster temperature function at different epochs reflects how the cluster mass function evolves .",
    "furthermore the evolution of the cluster mass function is exponentially sensitive to the mean density of the universe , so even a handful of massive clusters at high redshift can begin to constrain @xmath22 , the fraction of the critical density in the form of gravitating matter ( eke 1998 , donahue 1998 , bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; oukbir & blanchard 1992 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "this paper reports on our observations of the complete emss sample of high - redshift clusters .",
    "section  2 presents our observations of the cluster ms1137.5 + 6625 , the last of the high - redshift emss clusters to be observed with asca , the rosat hri , and keck - ii .",
    "section  3 summarizes and updates our findings for the sample as a whole and presents the temperature function for emss clusters at @xmath23 , the first derived from a complete sample at such high redshifts .",
    "section  4 assesses whether the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation for clusters evolves with redshift and finds no evidence for significant evolution .",
    "section  5 summarizes our results . in this paper",
    "we parametrize @xmath24 as @xmath25 , and explicitly state the @xmath26 assumed .",
    "cluster ms1137.5 + 6625 at @xmath27 is the last of the high - redshift emss clusters to be observed in our program .",
    "our asca observations find a best - fit rest - frame temperature for this cluster of _ kt  kev with a best - fit iron abundance of @xmath0 times solar ( 90% confidence intervals ) .",
    "the rosat observations indicate that the cluster is relatively compact , with a core radius of roughly @xmath28 .",
    "the velocity dispersion for the cluster derived from keck - ii observations of 22 cluster members ( @xmath29 ) is consistent with the asca x - ray temperature .",
    "because the uncertainties on the derived iron abundance are so large , we simultaneously fit the asca data on ms1137.5 + 6625 and ms1054.4 - 0321 ( @xmath30 ) while constraining their iron abundances to be the same in order to derive a `` mean '' iron abundance for clusters at @xmath31 equal to @xmath32 times solar ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the remainder of this section provides the details of these observations .",
    "asca executed a single long ( @xmath33 s ) exposure of the cluster ms1137.5 + 6625 during 1997 may 3 - 8 .",
    "this satellite carries four independent x - ray telescopes , two with gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) and two with solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) , from which we obtained four independent datasets . to prepare the data for analysis , we extracted clean x - ray event lists using a magnetic cut - off rigidity threshold of 4 gev  c@xmath2 and the recommended minimum elevation angles and bright earth angles to reject background contamination ( see day 1995 ) .",
    "events were extracted for spectral analysis from within circular apertures of radii 1.6 arcmin ( sis1 ) , 2.3 arcmin ( sis0 ) , and 3.25 arcmin ( gis ) to maximize the ratio of signal to background noise for the spectra analysis .",
    "the sis apertures are smaller than usual because the cluster was not centered on the sis detector . to obtain the best estimates of the total flux from the gis observations ,",
    "we increased the radius of the gis aperture to 5.0 arcmin ; these data were used for flux estimates only , not to obtain temperature estimates .",
    "we rejected @xmath3498% of cosmic ray events by using only sis chip data grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and we rejected hot and flickering pixels .",
    "light curves for each instrument were visually inspected , and time intervals with high background or data dropouts were excluded manually .",
    "we rebinned the sis data in the standard way to 512 spectral channels using bright2linear ( see day 1995 ) with the lowest 13 channels flagged as bad , and we regrouped all the spectral data so that no energy bin under consideration had fewer than 25 counts for the gis detector and 16 counts for the sis detector .",
    "table  [ asca ] gives the resulting net count rates and effective exposure times .",
    "we do not expect the derived x - ray fluxes to be consistent between the two sis detectors and the gis detectors because the target was not centered and some of the extended flux may have missed the sis detectors .",
    "background estimates were taken from the regions of the detector surrounding the cluster observation .",
    "the cluster is very compact , and local backgrounds have proved reliable for all of our previous observations ( donahue 1996 ; donahue 1998 ) .",
    "after rebinning the data , we restricted our fitting of the asca spectra to the @xmath35  kev range over which the signal - to - noise was adequate after background subtraction .    to analyze the spectra , we used xspec ( v10.0 ) from the software package xanadu available from the asca gof ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we fitted the spectral data from the four asca datasets and their respective response files ( see day 1995 ) .",
    "the individual sis response matrices were generated with the tool _ sisrmg _",
    "( 1997 version ) , which takes into account temporal variations in the gain and removes the inconsistencies seen in data analyzed with the standard sis response matrices .",
    "the standard model we used to fit the data was a raymond - smith thermal plasma with a temperature @xmath36 , absorbed by cold galactic gas with a characteristic column density of neutral hydrogen @xmath37 .",
    "the galactic column density toward the cluster is not constrained by the data .",
    "thus , we fixed soft x - ray absorption at an assumed galactic hi value of @xmath38 @xmath39 ( gioia 1990 ) . allowing the modelled @xmath37 intrinsic to the cluster to vary had little effect on the best - fit temperature ( @xmath40 kev ) and no significant improvement of reduced @xmath41 .",
    "thus , in the following results , we fixed the intrinsic column to be zero .",
    "each sis spectrum was fit with its own normalization ; the normalizations of the gis spectra were constrained to be the same .",
    "the parameters varied to provide a fit to 4 spectra were therefore the 3 independent normalizations ( 1 for each sis spectrum , 1 for both gis spectra ) , a single emission - weighted temperature , and the metallicity ( effectively the iron abundance of the cluster gas ) . the binned spectra and best - fit model convolved with the appropriate detector response matrix are found in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "note that this figure shows the average sis and gis spectra for display purposes only ; to reiterate : all spectral analyses were carried out on the individual datasets .",
    "the best - fit temperature was _ kt kev with a best - fit iron abundance of @xmath42 solar , where solar abundances are those of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "all uncertainties quoted are the 90% confidence levels for a single interesting parameter ( @xmath43 ) , and all fits have an acceptable reduced   of @xmath44 .",
    "the cluster flux in the 2 - 10 kev observed band within the gis3 5 arcmin aperture is @xmath45 ct s@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath46 , and the cluster luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev rest band is @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "this luminosity is consistent with the luminosity one would predict for a cluster of this temperature , given the low - redshift @xmath51 relation ( edge & stewart 1991 ; david 1993 ) .",
    "the rosat hri obtained observations of ms1137.5 + 6625 on 3 separate occasions for a total of 100,034 seconds ( table  [ hri ] ) .",
    "the hri data were filtered to include only pha bins 1 - 7 . by excluding the higher pha bins we reduced the background count rate but sacrificed very few source counts .",
    "contours of x - ray emission are overplotted on an optical image of the cluster from clowe et al . ( 1998 ) in figure  [ greyscale ] .",
    "we binned the hri data into 4  by 4  bins and fit a two - dimensional model to the x - ray emission by generating an intrinsic model , convolving that model with the hri point response function , and fitting that to the binned data ( see hughes & birkinshaw 1998 for a full description of the technique and software ) .",
    "the background count rate in the hri image near the cluster was @xmath52 counts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath2 .",
    "the best fit model to the surface brightness was a circular king model ( @xmath53^{-3\\beta + 1/2}$ ] ) with a core radius @xmath54 of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( 90% confidence for 2 interesting parameters ) . in figure  [ beta_core ]",
    "we plot the 68% , 90% , and 95% confidence contours for two interesting parameters , @xmath5 and core radius .",
    "the slope @xmath5 is not well measured with the hri data , but it is consistent with that of low redshift clusters of galaxies .",
    "we also fit an elliptical king model to the data , but without significant improvement in @xmath41 .",
    "this cluster is more compact than many x - ray clusters , with a core radius of only 71@xmath6 kpc ( @xmath7 ) to 61@xmath6 kpc ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the best - fit normalization corresponds to a central surface brightness of @xmath57 hri counts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath58 which is comparable to other high redshift clusters without strong cooling flows .",
    "ms0016 + 16 , for example , has a central surface brightness of @xmath59 hri counts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath58 ( hughes & birkinshaw 1998 ) .",
    "the nominal center of the x - ray emission in ms1137.5 + 6625 is @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we converted the observed central surface brightness to physical units by assuming 1 hri count = @xmath62 erg @xmath39 .",
    "the calibration was derived by using the iraf / pros program called _ hxflux _ to convert the count rate to an unabsorbed energy flux between the rosat band energies of 0.2 - 2.5 kev , assuming that @xmath63  kev , log @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and abundances of 30% solar .",
    "the conversion is not very sensitive to the assumed abundances , varying by only 1 - 3% when assumed @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the central surface brightness is thus @xmath68 .",
    "we estimated a gas mass for this cluster by converting the central hri surface brightness into a central electron density of @xmath69 @xmath70 using the relation of henry & henriksen ( 1986 ) , modified to account for redshift effects on surface brightness ( hughes & birkinshaw 1998 ) .",
    "the gas mass is integrated out to a radius of 0.5 @xmath6  mpc by assuming @xmath71^{-3\\beta/2}$ ] , with values of @xmath72 and @xmath5 from our fit to the hri observations .",
    "the value 1.14 is the mass per free electron in a fully - ionized , primordial hydrogen / helium plasma in units of the proton mass , @xmath73 where @xmath74 , the number fraction of he / h is 0.08 .",
    "the gas mass interior to @xmath75  mpc found in this way is @xmath76 , for @xmath50 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "the main uncertainty in the central electron density and the gas mass inside 0.5  h@xmath2 mpc arises from our fit to the hri data .",
    "the uncertainties reflect the 90% statistical uncertainties in @xmath5 , @xmath72 , and the appropriate fit normalization .",
    "the total mass interior to @xmath78  mpc can be estimated if we assume that the icm is nearly isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium within the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "the total mass inside a radius of @xmath78 mpc would then be @xmath79 ( relatively insensitive to @xmath26 ) .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty are in the @xmath5 value for the gas distribution ( @xmath5 is proportional to the total mass under our assumptions ) and the absolute temperature . the quoted uncertainty does not reflect the systematic uncertainty in the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , which , according to current numerical simulations ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; evrard 1997 ; roettiger , stone & mushotzky 1997 ; roettiger , burns , & loken 1996 ) , can be considerable ( @xmath80 ) but less than the statistical uncertainities of our data .",
    "the minimum mass estimate from weak lensing in this cluster is @xmath81 interior to 0.5  @xmath6 mpc ( clowe 1998 ) , consistent with the x - ray derived mass inside the same radius .",
    "the gas fraction within @xmath78  mpc is therefore @xmath82 , but this ratio could be as high as @xmath83 if both @xmath5 and the actual virial temperature are at the low end of their respective 90% uncertainty ranges . furthermore , according to the simulations mentioned in the previous paragraph , cluster masses derived from x - ray temperatures can exceed their actual masses by up to @xmath84 , so the true gas fraction could be up to 20% higher ( @xmath85 ) if the gravitational mass is overestimated .",
    "these observations , therefore , do not necessarily imply that the gas fraction in this cluster is any different from the gas fractions typical of lower - redshift clusters .    in earlier work , donahue ( 1996 ) reported that the cluster ms0451.6 - 0305 showed evidence for a lower gas fraction than is typical of local clusters . a re - analysis of the hri data for the cluster ms0451.6 - 0305 ( z=0.54 ) using the techniques described here give a central surface brightness of @xmath86 hri counts s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath58 and a best - fit @xmath87 and @xmath88 arcminutes ( 90% uncertainties for two interesting parameters . )",
    "the corresponding central electron density is @xmath89 @xmath70 , and the gas mass inside 0.5 @xmath6 mpc is @xmath90 , for @xmath50 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "this estimate corrects the value in donahue ( 1996 ) which omitted a @xmath91 factor for the central density . the gas fraction for ms0451.6 - 0305",
    "is thus revised upward to span @xmath92 , spanning the 90% ranges of allowed @xmath5 , core radius , and @xmath93 ( donahue 1996 ; this work ) .",
    "thus we find no evidence that the gas fraction has changed in cluster cores from either of the clusters ms1137.5 + 6625 or ms0451.6 - 0305 .",
    "( the hri data for cluster ms1054.4@xmath940321 does not allow for straightforward conversion of the measured emissivity to gas mass since the x - ray emission profile shows internal structure and the cluster may not be hydrodynamically relaxed ( donahue 1998 ) . )",
    "the cooling time within the core of ms1137.5 + 6625 , estimated from the ratio @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the free - free emissivity of hydrogen gas at temperature @xmath97 , is somewhat shorter than the hubble time at @xmath27 .",
    "we assumed @xmath98 t^{0.5}$ ] erg @xmath70 s@xmath2 , where @xmath99 , @xmath97 is the electron temperature in units of kelvins , @xmath100 is the electron density , and the factor 1.14 comes from the assumption that the gas is fully ionized .",
    "the cooling rate is estimated by computing the amount of gas inside the radius at which the cooling time equals the hubble time at the redshift of the cluster , and dividing by the hubble time at the cluster redshift . for a range of cosmological assumptions ( @xmath101 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath102 ) ,",
    "the derived cooling rate lies between 20 and 400 m@xmath13 yr@xmath2 , where the slower rates correspond to @xmath50 .",
    "the cooling rates estimated in this way are far more sensitive to @xmath26 than to @xmath24 . for @xmath103",
    "km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath7 , the inferred cooling rate is 130 m@xmath13 yr@xmath2 .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy of galaxies in the cluster ms1137.5 + 6625 was obtained with lris ( oke 1995 ) on the keck - ii telescope on feb .",
    "17 , 1998 . we used a 1.5@xmath104 slit width and a 300 line / mm grating at 5000  , with the gg495 filter .",
    "the wavelength scale was 2.47  / pix ; the spatial scale was 0.215@xmath104/pixel .",
    "the seeing was 0.8@xmath104 - 1.0@xmath104 .",
    "three masks with total exposure times of 6300 , 6900 , and 7200 seconds were used to obtain spectra .",
    "twenty - three galaxies in ms1137.5 + 6625 have concordant redshifts ( table  [ galaxies ] ) .",
    "one galaxy was discarded by the three - sigma clipping code used to compute the velocity dispersion ( danese , de zotti , & di tullio 1980 ) , for 22 cluster members in total .",
    "the dispersion for the 22 galaxies is @xmath105 km / sec ( 1-sigma errors ) , with a mean redshift of @xmath106 .",
    "a similar result was obtained using rostat ( beers , flynn & gebhardt 1990 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion corresponds to a cluster temperature of @xmath107 kev ( 1-sigma errors ) .",
    "although the velocities of the cluster galaxies may appear to be a little `` cooler '' than the cluster gas , in fact the temperature and velocity dispersion are statistically in agreement .",
    "the temperature and velocity dispersion of ms1137.5 + 6625 are completely consistent with the observed relationship for lower redshift clusters ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) and for other @xmath108 emss clusters ( donahue 1998 ) .",
    "the agreement of the x - ray temperature and the velocity dispersion and the agreement of the x - ray mass and the lensing mass from clowe ( 1998 ) suggest that the cooling flow in this cluster does not affect the emission - weighted temperature significantly .      the iron line detection in ms1137.5 + 6625 , if real , is the most distant iron line detected in the emss cluster sample .",
    "the best - fit abundance is consistent with the abundances of low - redshift clusters ; however , the uncertainty range is disappointingly large . in order to improve our constraints on icm abundances at @xmath31",
    ", we can combine our asca data on ms1137.5 + 6625 with our existing asca data on ms1054.4@xmath940321 , the other emss cluster at this redshift ( donahue 1998 ) .",
    "we estimated a `` mean '' iron abundance of clusters at @xmath31 by simultaneously fitting all of the asca data for ms1137.5 + 6625 and ms1054.4@xmath940321 .",
    "we allowed the temperatures of the two clusters to differ , but required their metal abundances to be equal .",
    "the galactic absorption columns to each cluster and the redshifts were fixed at their individual values .",
    "the resulting iron abundance was @xmath4 for a formal 90% confidence range for one interesting fit parameter ( @xmath43 . )",
    "the mean iron abundance at @xmath31 is statistically more significant than the abundance determinations for the individual clusters and is similar to that of clusters of galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "this result implies that the metal enrichment of the cluster icm , presumably from supernovae erupting in cluster galaxies , must have occurred before @xmath31 .",
    "a primary motivation for observing distant clusters with asca has been to establish a temperature function for high - redshift clusters that can be compared with cosmological models . now",
    "that we have asca data in hand for almost all the emss clusters at @xmath23 , we can construct a high - redshift temperature function that is based on a complete sample of clusters ( table  [ sample ] ) .",
    "the flux limit of our subsample of the emss , set by asca s capabilities , is approximately @xmath109 in the emss detection cell of @xmath110 arcminutes , within the einstein bandpass of 0.3 - 3.5 kev .",
    "some of the original clusters listed in henry ( 1992 ) are revised in our updated sample .",
    "we have revised the redshift of cluster ms1241.5 + 1710 upward from 0.31 to 0.54 , based on spectroscopy of the cd galaxy and one other galaxy .",
    "the cluster candidate ms2053.7 - 0449 at @xmath111 drops out of the sample because short followup observations by the rosat hri failed to detect it .",
    "its x - ray flux is thus likely to be below the flux limits of our sample .",
    "however , it was definitely detected by the einstein ipc , and long rosat hri and asca observations have been made ( pi : henry ) . the cluster candidate ms1610.4 + 6616 ( gioia & luppino 1994 ) is an x - ray point source and is excluded from our sample , since it is a likely agn .    the resulting emss sample of clusters of galaxies with redshifts greater than 0.5 is listed in table  [ sample ] .",
    "the x - ray temperatures for the cluster ms 1241.5 + 1710 were extracted and fit from archival asca data using the same procedure as described above .",
    "we also analyzed the complete suite of asca data for the ms0015.9 + 1609 cluster , excluding the sis0 and sis1 dataset of the second observation contained in the heasarc because they exhibited severe anomalies .",
    "this analysis differs somewhat from the hughes & birkinshaw ( 1998 ) analysis in that our analysis included 6 out of the 8 asca datasets available as well as the rosat pspc data , while hughes & birkinshaw ( 1998 ) analyzed the pspc data and the gis data from the performance verification stage of the asca mission only .",
    "however , the mean temperature that we obtain ( @xmath112 kev , 90% confidence limits ) is statistically consistent with their temperature limits of @xmath113 kev ( @xmath114 errors ) , and all other best fit spectral values ( fe / h and @xmath115 ) are nearly identical .",
    "these fits are also consistent with the results of furuzawa ( 1998 ) who obtain a best fit temperature of @xmath116 kev .",
    "the detection cell fluxes ( table  [ sample ] ) are from the einstein ipc ( 0.3 - 3.5 kev ) .",
    "the total fluxes within a 5 - 6 arcmin aperture were measured from the asca gis3 observations of each cluster .",
    "( the sis observations do not in general provide a good estimate of the total flux because flux is lost off the side of the main ccd or between the ccds . )",
    "luminosities were computed within xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) , assuming the appropriate cosmological models .",
    "we could recover , to within uncertainties , estimates of the einstein detect cell flux from the large aperture asca gis fluxes and estimates about the cluster structure ( see table  [ sample ] ) . from the gis total fluxes , we determined the bolometric x - ray luminosity for each cluster ( by using the _ dummyrsp _ capability in xspec ) .",
    "the original einstein detection fluxes were used to compute maximum volume @xmath117 within which the x - ray emission from the cluster would exceed the flux limits of the emss , assuming that all clusters have an average core radius of @xmath118 mpc ( table  [ sample ] ) .",
    "we derived maximum volumes for each of the clusters following the prescription of henry ( 1992 ) , using the einstein detection cell fluxes and assuming a mean core radius of @xmath119 kpc and @xmath120 .",
    "the assumed source parameters did not influence the maximum volumes significantly , so we simply assumed the same parameters for all of the clusters . for most of the clusters , the maximum volume spanned the redshift limits of the sample ( @xmath121 ) . the cumulative temperature function",
    "was then computed by summing @xmath122 for each @xmath123 .",

    "the statistical review of these data and comparison to semi - analytic models are continued in our analysis paper ( donahue & voit 1999 ) , which finds that this amount of evolution in the temperature function is consistent with @xmath129 ( open universe ) or @xmath130 ( flat universe ) , with systematic uncertainties of an additional @xmath131 ( see also donahue 1999 for our preliminary report of this work ) . as we reported in donahue ( 1998 )",

    "the relationship between the cluster x - ray luminosity and the mean temperature of its icm and the evolution of that relationship are relevant both for what we can learn about cluster icm physics and for tests of cosmology from studying the evolution of the cluster luminosity function .    at low redshift ,",
    "the x - ray luminosities of galaxy clusters are related to their temperatures via a power law : @xmath134 with @xmath135 ( edge & stewart 1991 ; david 1993 , arnaud & evrard 1998 ) .",
    "not all clusters are isothermal and the scatter in this relation can be reduced if one corrects for the cooler gas often found in cluster cores .",

    "are consistent with these low-@xmath124 temperature - luminosity relations . here",

    "one way to account for this discrepancy is to suppose that the icm of each cluster undergoes a similar pre - heating event that fixes the minimum specific entropy at a value common to all ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) .",
    "then the core density is determined by the icm temperature ( @xmath142 for an ideal gas ) , and the luminosity should scale as @xmath143 , with redshift evolution depending on how and when the cluster gas heats or cools ( e.g. , bower 1997 ) .    furthermore , the scaling of cluster luminosities with cluster temperatures is an important step in the exercise of connecting the observed x - ray luminosity function of clusters at different redshifts with predictions of the evolution of the cluster mass function . if the evolution of the cluster @xmath144 relation is strongly positive ( @xmath145 , where @xmath146 ) , then the lack of evolution in the cluster luminosity function , at least at @xmath147 ( rosati 1998 ; ebeling 1998 ; sadat , blanchard , & oukbir 1998 ; mathiesen & evrard 1998 ) , is remotely consistent with the strong evolution of the mass function predicted by @xmath148 models ( borgani 1999 ) .",
    "this consistency arises because the evolution in the mass function may be counteracted by evolution in the @xmath149 relation ( see also oukbir & blanchard 1992 for the emss sample ) .    in order to constrain the redshift evolution of the @xmath141@xmath36 relation with observations",
    ", we have compiled data on @xmath150 cluster bolometric luminosities , temperatures , and redshifts from mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) , donahue ( 1996 ) , donahue ( 1998 ) , and henry ( 1997 ) .",
    "we have added cluster ax2019 ( hattori 1997 ) to this sample and have revised the redshift , luminosity , and temperature of the cluster ms1241.5 + 1710 as described above .",
    "since we can not correct our high - redshift temperatures for deviations from isothermality with our current data , we have chosen to compare mean temperatures of clusters at low redshift with mean temperatures of clusters at high redshift and to quantify the higher intrinsic dispersion incurred . for simplicity , we compare the data with an @xmath141@xmath36 relation assuming a power - law redshift dependence : @xmath151 ( borgani 1999 ) . formally , the observational uncertainties in the temperature measurements are often significantly smaller than the scatter in the relation , demonstrating that there are physical effects that are not taken into account by a simple relation , such as cooling flows ( see allen & fabian ( 1998 ) ; markevitch ( 1998 ) for how these effects might be handled in x - ray data with sufficient resolution and signal to noise . )    for illustrative purposes , we plot the @xmath152 and the @xmath127 bolometric luminosity and temperature data in figure  [ lt ] , along with the markevitch bolometric @xmath153 fit to the relation , with @xmath154 dispersion to corrected temperatures and luminosities of low - redshift clusters ( @xmath155 where @xmath156 ) .",
    "we note that the uncorrected high - redshift points cluster around the low - redshift relation within the dispersion . in figure",
    "[ lt ] , the normalization of the low - redshift markevitch relation has been evolved appropriate to @xmath157 for two epochs , @xmath158 and @xmath3 . this amount of evolution is ruled out by the data .    to test the significance to which evolution of the @xmath153 relation could be constrained , the procedure was to obtain a linear regression fit of the expression @xmath159 to the redshift , luminosity , and temperature data .",
    "we weighted each point by defining an effective standard deviation @xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the upper and lower bounds on the 90% confidence interval of the temperature .",
    "this value for @xmath163 roughly reproduces the width of the 68% confidence interval normally associated with @xmath164 .",
    "the david ( 1993 ) cluster temperature catalog provides both 68% and 90% confidence limits .",
    "the mean ratio between the 68% intervals and the corresponding 90% intervals is @xmath165 for @xmath166 kev .    to check this estimate",
    ", the actual probability distributions for each of the measurements were derived for the 5 emss clusters in our highest redshift sample .",
    "we then fit the probability distributions to gaussians .",
    "the results of this exercise demonstrated that the estimate of the size of the 68% uncertainties from the 90% uncertainties as obtained from the literature is reasonable .",
    "however , we also note in the cases where the error bars are uneven in size ( the upper error bar is larger than the lower error bar ) , the mean temperature from the gaussian fit is higher than the actual best - fit temperature , and the errors from the gaussian fit are approximately the mean of the two original errors ( table  [ chisq - fit ] . )    formally , the best fitting @xmath51 relation is not a good fit , owing to the significant intrinsic scatter in the relationship between luminosity and temperature",
    ". intrinsic scatter can be caused by inclusion of `` cooling - flow '' emission from the core of the galaxy and other processes that affect the luminosity of the cluster , which is very sensitive to the electron density in the icm . to ensure that our @xmath41 values reflected the actual scatter in the @xmath51 relation",
    ", we added a constant intrinsic scatter term to each measurement s standard deviation in quadrature , so that the reduced @xmath167 for the best fit . in this case , the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath168 relationship in the temperature of clusters with @xmath169 kev and @xmath170 is @xmath171 in units of log kev .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in log t for these clusters is nearly identical to that of low redshift clusters .",
    "markevitch ( 1998 ) finds an intrinsic scatter of @xmath172 for uncorrected temperature data .",
    "mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) also noted that the intrinsic variance in the @xmath168 did not change with redshift in their analysis of a subset of the clusters analyzed here , with @xmath173 .",
    "because the observed luminosities of clusters at these moderate redshifts depend on the assumed cosmology , we fit the @xmath141@xmath36 relation for three different cosmologies .",
    "our results for the best fit @xmath174 vs. @xmath175 are displayed in figure  [ qo5 ] .",
    "the most relevant cosmology for @xmath176 models is the flat @xmath50 assumption .",
    "the @xmath175 distribution for @xmath174 in a critical ( @xmath128 ) cosmology , shown in figure  [ qo5 ] , demonstrates that self - similar evolution ( @xmath177 ) is a poor fit to the data , even when intrinsic dispersion is accounted for .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath174 is actually slightly negative and @xmath178 for @xmath177 .",
    "our results are statistically consistent with those obtained by reichart , castander , & nichol ( 1999 ) , who assumed all of the emss clusters had a cluster temperature of 6 kev and who fit only the @xmath179 clusters .",
    "the absence of @xmath141@xmath36 evolution in our sample poses serious difficulties for cluster evolution in a critical universe .",
    "the reason for this difficulty is that in order to account for the lack of evolution observed in the cluster luminosity function out to @xmath180 ( rosati 1998 ) , models in which @xmath148 must include sufficient luminosity evolution to mask the dramatic number evolution in the mass function that occurs if @xmath148 ( viana & liddle 1996 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ) . the power - law index of @xmath181 which reproduces the lack of evolution of the observed cluster luminosity function at the outer limits of statistical and systematic uncertainties ( borgani 1999 ) results in an extremely poor fit to our high redshift @xmath141@xmath36 data for any @xmath26",

    "the luminosity and temperature are consistent with the empirical relation between x - ray luminosity and redshift for low - redshift clusters of galaxies .",
    "the velocity dispersion of 22 member galaxies measured with the keck - ii telescope and lris is @xmath185 km / sec , which is consistent with the value of the icm temperature .",
    "this consistency implies that the thermal properties of the x - ray gas and the dynamics of the galaxies are both governed by the gravitational potential of the cluster .",

    "this is consistent with the isothermal mass estimated from the cluster temperature and the best - fit @xmath187 from the hri observations of @xmath188 .",
