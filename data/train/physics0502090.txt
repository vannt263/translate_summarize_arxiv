    "this work sets a lower limit on their influence by doing the measurement with the two atomic sources .",
    "statistics limit the mot results , while the radiation trapping is the limiting factor in the glass cell .",
    "this measurement improves previous determinations by a factor of thirty .",
    "our measurement of the lifetime of the first excited state in the @xmath5 manifold of rubidium has reached a precision of 0.3 % which permits a very careful tests of the calculated matrix elements that contribute to the lifetime of the @xmath0 state .",
    "these _ ab initio _ mbpt calculations represent the state of the art in atomic structure calculations and require a very thorough understanding of the electron correlations and many other subtle effects that add and subtract in the expansions .",
    "the same techniques applied for rubidium are used in cesium and the agreement between experiment and theory enhances the confidence in the established calculation techniques to provide the necessary information such as matrix elements for the extraction of weak interaction parameters from the pnc measurements in cesium and in future measurement in other alkali atoms .    work supported by nsf .",
