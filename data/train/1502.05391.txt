    "<S> recent theoretical insights into the possibility of non - abelian phases in @xmath0 fractional quantum hall states revived the interest in the numerical phase diagram of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of various kinds of two - body interlayer couplings on the @xmath1 bilayer state and exactly solve the hamiltonian for up to @xmath2 electrons on sphere and torus geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we consider interlayer tunneling , short - ranged repulsive / attractive pseudopotential interactions and coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> we find a 6-fold ground - state degeneracy on the torus when the interlayer hollow - core interaction is dominant . to identify the topological nature of this phase we measure the orbital - cut entanglement spectrum , quasihole counting , topological entanglement entropy , and wave - function overlap . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the numerical results to the theoretical predictions , we interpret this 6-fold ground - state degeneracy phase to be the non - abelian bilayer fibonacci state .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ there is a surging interest in the search for non - abelian ( na ) anyons in topological states of matter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> na anyons register protected quantum memory and the stored information can be processed through braiding the world line of na anyons . </S>",
    "<S> this comprises the basic notion of building fault - tolerant quantum computers . </S>",
    "<S> two famous examples are ising and fibonacci anyons which have been conjectured to emerge in @xmath3 and @xmath4 fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular fibonacci anyons are of interest for universal quantum computation . however , there is no experimental observation of these exotic quasiparticles in fqh systems to date . </S>",
    "<S> another approach for realizing na anyons is through coupling abelian states via various types of interactions to drive phase transition to na topological phases  @xcite . in a realistic experimental situation , some of the interactions considered in theoretical investigations are indeed relevant  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pursuing this direction further can potentially lead to a novel venue for realizing na anyons .    in this rapid communication </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on the two - component fqh system at @xmath0 , whose parent state consists of two decoupled @xmath5 laughlin states </S>",
    "<S> . the two components may describe physical spins  @xcite , spatial ( physical layer ) degrees of freedom , e.g. , in the wide quantum well realization of the @xmath6 state  @xcite , or valley indices in graphene - like systems  @xcite . for convenience , we refer to all these various realizations of two - component systems as the `` _ @xmath6 bilayer _ '' state . </S>",
    "<S> early studies of the @xmath6 bilayer state focused on various possible abelian phases  @xcite and the experimental observation of phase transitions  @xcite . in particular mcdonald and haldane numerically established the phase diagram of the system in the presence of interlayer tunneling and the bare coulomb interaction projected to the lowest landau level ( lll )  @xcite and confirmed the possibility of various abelian phases . recent analytical insights into the possibility of na phases in the @xmath6 bilayer state  @xcite brought this seemingly closed problem into new focus . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite imply that microscopic realizations of these na phases require perturbation to the model hamiltonian consisting of interlayer tunneling and the bare coulomb interaction projected to the lll . </S>",
    "<S> in fact such perturbations may already exist in experimental systems .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the recent proposals  @xcite beg for revisiting the @xmath6 bilayer problem numerically considering the modified interlayer coulomb interaction and interlayer tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> any two - body interaction projected to the lll can be expanded in terms of the so - called haldane pseudopotentials , @xmath7  @xcite , which are projector operators of two electrons to the state with relative angular momentum @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> modifying the coulomb interaction amounts to changing the coefficient of the pseudo - potentials . here , we modify the interlayer coulomb interaction by changing its dominant components , namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( also known as hollow - core interaction ) . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the resulting hamiltonian for up to @xmath2 electrons using the exact - diagonalization ( ed ) method and utilize a variety of numerical measurements to establish the nature of different topological phases achieved through varying coupling parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a wide range of parameters where enhancing @xmath10 and suppressing @xmath9 components of the coulomb interaction drives phase transition to a na state with fibonacci anyons .    _ model . </S>",
    "<S> _ we start with two @xmath5 laughlin states that are coupled through a number of distinct interlayer interactions . </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider a torus with @xmath11 dimensions . in the landau gauge @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> single - particle states in the lll are labeled by their momentum along the @xmath13 direction quantized as @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the parent state , the @xmath1 halperin state @xcite , is the exact eigenstate of the following @xmath15 haldane s pseudopotential @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the layer index , @xmath18 annihilates an electron with @xmath14 momentum , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effects of interlayer coupling by considering both tunneling and interlayer two - body interaction of haldane s @xmath21 and @xmath15 pseudo - potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling hamiltonian is @xmath22 where @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - body interactions are @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 in order to address the stability of the phases that we obtain with this model we also consider the effect of interlayer coulomb interaction in the limit of negligible interlayer separation perturbed by the above terms .    </S>",
    "<S> _ candidate phases . _ </S>",
    "<S> below , we consider two categories of possible states at @xmath0 : abelian and non - abelian , each with three members . </S>",
    "<S> table [ tab1 ] summarizes some of their defining properties . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the @xmath1 state , which is simply two decoupled @xmath5 laughlin states . </S>",
    "<S> this phase has @xmath27-fold degenerate ground states on the torus . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) @xmath28 : the particle - hole(ph ) conjugate of the @xmath5 laughlin state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) layer singlet state : the nonchiral @xmath29 halperin state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the bilayer fibonacci phase  @xcite , which is a non - abelian state described by @xmath30 chern - simons field theory and contains @xmath31 distinct quasiparticles , three of which are non - abelian with @xmath32 quantum dimension . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) the interlayer ( i.  l. ) pfaffian state  @xcite , which has @xmath27 distinct quasiparticles and its wave - function can be written as the product of the @xmath33 halperin state and a pfaffian wave - function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( vi ) the fermionic @xmath34 @xmath35 read - rezayi ( rr ) state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this non - abelian state with @xmath36 distinct quasiparticles is described by @xmath37 edge conformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> a unique feature of this state is the emergence of a non - abelian quasihole excitation with @xmath38 fractional charge .    </S>",
    "<S> .total central charge @xmath39 , ground - state degeneracy ( gsd ) , the sphere shift @xmath40 , total quantum dimension @xmath41 , and orbital - cut entanglement spectrum ( oes ) counting for @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the angular momenta relative to the ground state ) for various topological phases at @xmath0 . for na states , </S>",
    "<S> the oes counting generally depends on the number of electrons @xmath44 and the pseudospin @xmath45 in region @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> here we only show the case when @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is an integer and @xmath49 for the fibonacci and i.  l. pfaffian states ( @xmath35 rr state ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the countings of the bilayer fibonacci state with @xmath50 ( mod 2 ) and @xmath35 rr state with @xmath50 ( mod 4 ) are equal for @xmath51 , they are different for other values of @xmath44 . the counting of the @xmath29 state is the convolution of the counting of two counter - propagating @xmath52 modes .
