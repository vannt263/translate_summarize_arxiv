    "more than forty years ago , jaynes and cummings @xcite introduced a fully quantum mechanical model for the interaction of light and matter , which are represented by a single harmonic oscillator and a two - level system , respectively . within dipole approximation for the interaction , that model",
    "is expressed by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the level splitting of the two - level system , henceforth `` qubit '' , @xmath2 is the frequency of the electromagnetic field mode , and @xmath3 the dipole interaction strength .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath4 , @xmath5 , refer to the two - level system , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of the electromagnetic field mode .",
    "this model describes a wealth of physical phenomena rather well and by now is a `` standard model '' of quantum optics .",
    "a particular experimental realization of the hamiltonian is an atom interacting with the field inside an optical cavity , usually referred to as cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) .",
    "corresponding experiments have demonstrated quantum coherence between light and matter manifest in phenomena such as rabi oscillations and entanglement @xcite .    despite its simplicity",
    ", the hamiltonian can not be diagonalized exactly and , thus , is often simplified by a rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "there , one expresses the qubit - cavity interaction in terms of the ladder operators @xmath8 . in the interaction picture with respect to the uncoupled hamiltonian , the coupling operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 oscillate with the phase factors @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] , respectively .",
    "operating at or near resonance , the cavity - qubit detuning is small , @xmath15 , so that the former operators oscillate slowly , whereas the latter exhibit fast `` counter - rotating '' oscillations .",
    "if in addition , the coupling is sufficiently weak , @xmath16 , one can separate time scales and replace the counter - rotating terms by their vanishing time average .",
    "then one obtains the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite @xmath17    lately , new interest in jaynes - cumming physics has emerged in the solid state realm .",
    "there , one implements artificial atoms with cooper - pair boxes ( charge qubits ) @xcite or superconducting loops ( flux qubits ) @xcite .",
    "the role of the cavity is played now by a transmission line or a squid depending on the architecture @xcite , or even a nanomechanical oscillator @xcite .",
    "since the first experimental realizations in 2004 @xcite , a plethora of results has been obtained , such as quantum - non - demolition - like readout of a qubit state @xcite , the generation of fock states @xcite , the observation of berry phases @xcite , multi - photon resonances @xcite , entanglement between two qubits inside one cavity @xcite , and the demonstration of a two - qubit algorithm @xcite .",
    "these experiments have in common that they operate in the strong coupling limit , that is , the coupling @xmath3 is larger than the linewidth of the resonator . on the other hand , @xmath3 is typically two orders of magnitude less than the qubit and resonator frequencies . in this scenario",
    "the jaynes - cummings model has been shown to describe the experiments faithfully .    of practical interest",
    "is the dispersive limit , in which the qubit and the resonator are far detuned compared to the coupling strength , @xmath18 @xcite . in this regime",
    "a non - demolition type measurement of the qubit can be performed by probing the resonator @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible to simulate quantum spin chains with two or more qubits that are dispersively coupled to one resonator @xcite .",
    "the complementary architecture of two cavities dispersively coupled to one qubit allows building a quantum switch @xcite .",
    "all these ideas have been developed from the rwa model in the dispersive limit or from according generalizations to many qubits or many oscillators .",
    "thus , these theories are restricted to the range @xmath19 where the first inequality refers to the dispersive limit , while the second one has been used to derive the rwa hamiltonian from the original model .    in recent experiments",
    ", efforts are made to reach an even stronger qubit - cavity coupling @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it will eventually be no longer possible to fulfill both inequalities @xcite . in particular , when trying to operate in the dispersive limit , the second inequality may be violated , so that rwa is no longer applicable .",
    "non - rwa effects of the model hamiltonian   have already been studied in the complementary adiabatic limits @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , van vleck perturbation theory has been used in the resonant and close - to - resonant cases @xcite .",
    "finally , polaron transformation @xcite , cluster methods @xcite , wave - packet approach @xcite and even generalized rwa approximations @xcite have been considered .    motivated by the importance of the dispersive regime and in view of the experimental tendency towards stronger qubit - oscillator coupling , we present in this work a dispersive theory beyond rwa , so that the second condition in eq .",
    "can be dropped .",
    "this means that our approach is valid under the less stringent condition @xmath22 which implies that the detuning is not necessarily smaller than @xmath23 and @xmath2 . in order to set the stage , we briefly review in sec .  [ sec : disp - jc ] the dispersive theory within rwa . in sec .  [ sec : dispn ]",
    ", we derive a dispersive theory for hamiltonian beyond rwa , which we generalize in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi - qb ] to the presence of several qubits .",
    "the dispersive limit is characterized by a large detuning @xmath24 as compared to the qubit - oscillator coupling @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 represents a small parameter , while the rwa hamiltonian is valid for @xmath26 .",
    "then it is convenient to separate the coupling term from the rwa hamiltonian , i.e. , to write @xmath27 with the contributions @xmath28 applying the unitary transformation , @xmath29 one obtains for the transformed hamiltonian @xmath30 to second order in @xmath31 : @xmath32 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 [ [ h_\\mathrm{rwa } , x_-],x_-]$ ] , which can be evaluated to read @xmath33 the physical interpretation of ( [ hjcdisp ] ) is that the oscillator frequency is shifted as @xmath34 where the sign depends on the state of the qubit . if one now probes the resonator with a microwave signal at its bare resonance frequency @xmath2 , the phase of the reflected signal possesses a shift that depends on the qubit state .",
    "this allows one to measure the low - frequency dynamics of the qubit @xcite . since , according to eq .",
    ", the qubit hamiltonian @xmath35 commutes with the dispersive coupling @xmath36 , this constitutes a quantum non - demolition measurement of the qubit , which has already been implemented experimentally @xcite . in turn , the qubit energy splitting is shifted depending on the mean photon number @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , one can also measure the mean photon number , and even perform a full quantum state tomography of the oscillator state @xcite .",
    "note also that besides the condition of @xmath31 being small , the perturbational result is accurate only if the mean photon number @xmath38 does not exceed the critical value @xmath39 . for larger photon numbers , higher powers of the number operator @xmath40 must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we restrict ourselves to the so - called linear dispersive regime , in which the photon number is clearly below the critical value @xmath41 .",
    "it is now our aim to treat the original hamiltonian in the dispersive limit accordingly , i.e. , to derive an expression that corresponds to eq .",
    "but is valid in the full dispersive regime defined by inequality .",
    "going beyond rwa , we have to keep the counter - rotating coupling terms @xmath42 which are relevant if either of the relations @xmath43 or @xmath26 is violated . separating again the qubit - oscillator coupling from the bare terms , we rewrite hamiltonian as @xmath44 which differs from @xmath45 by the last term .",
    "it will turn out that a unitary transformation corresponding to eq .",
    "is achieved by the operator @xmath46 here we have introduced the parameter @xmath47 which obviously fulfills the relation @xmath48 , since @xmath23 and @xmath2 are positive .",
    "thus , whenever @xmath31 is small , @xmath49 is small as well .",
    "nevertheless , under condition , @xmath31 and @xmath49 may be of the same order .    proceeding as in sec .",
    "[ sec : disp - jc ] , we define the dispersive hamiltonian @xmath50 . using the commutation relations @xmath51",
    "= \\sigma^ z ( 2 a^\\dagger a + 1 )   -1 $ ] , @xmath52   = - ( \\epsilon + \\omega ) y_+ $ ] and @xmath53= \\sigma^ z \\ { a^2 + ( a^\\dagger)^2 \\}$ ] , we obtain the expression @xmath54 which is valid up to second order in the dimensionless coupling parameters @xmath31 and @xmath49 .    as compared to the rwa result , we find two differences : first , the prefactor of the coupling has a contribution that obviously stems from @xmath49 .",
    "second and more importantly , the coupling is no longer proportional to the number operator @xmath40 , but rather to @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the operator @xmath56 has turned into the counter - rotating contributions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "for this reason , the dispersive hamiltonian is not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the uncoupled hamiltonian @xmath59 .    nevertheless , it is possible to interpret the result as a qubit - state dependent frequency shift by the following reasoning .",
    "let us interpret @xmath60 as the hamiltonian of a particle with unit mass in the potential @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "then the qubit - oscillator coupling in eq .   modifies the potential curvature @xmath63 , such that the oscillator frequency undergoes a shift according to @xmath64 again the sign depends on the qubit state . to be consistent with the second - order approximation in @xmath3",
    ", we have to expand also the square root to that order .",
    "this complies with the experimentally interesting parameter regime where @xmath65 .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath66 as for the rwa hamiltonian , we find that the qubit state shifts the resonance frequency of the oscillator .",
    "this result is not only of appealing simplicity , but also has a rather important consequence : dispersive readout is possible even when the qubit - oscillator coupling is so strong that condition can not be fulfilled , that is , when the rwa result is not valid .    for a quantitative analysis of our analytical findings",
    ", we compare the frequency shifts and with numerical results . in doing so",
    ", we diagonalize the hamiltonian in the subspace of the qubit state @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wr ] .     for the spin state @xmath67 obtained ( a ) within rwa , eq .  , and ( b ) beyond rwa , eq .  .",
    "the lines mark the analytical results , while the symbols refer to the numerically obtained splitting between the ground state and the first excited state in the subspace of the qubit state @xmath67 . ]    for a qubit splitting @xmath23 close to the cavity frequency @xmath2 , i.e. , outside the dispersive regime , the analytically obtained frequency shifts diverge .",
    "this behavior is certainly expected for an expansion in @xmath69 . for a relatively small coupling @xmath70 , the rwa result [ panel ( a ) ] agrees very well with the numerical data in the dispersive regime . in the case of larger coupling strengths , @xmath71 , the predictions from rwa exhibit clear differences .",
    "the general tendency is that rwa overestimates the frequency shift for blue detuning @xmath72 , while it predicts a too small shift for red detuning .",
    "the data shown in panel ( b ) demonstrates that the treatment beyond rwa yields the correct frequency shift in the entire dispersive regime , i.e. , whenever the detuning significantly exceeds the coupling , @xmath73 .",
    "thus , as long as the coupling remains much smaller than the oscillator frequency , @xmath74 , it is always possible to tune the qubit splitting @xmath23 into a regime in which [ dispersivenonrwa ] is fulfilled .",
    "moreover , the excellent quantitative agreement of our analytical result with the numerically exact solution indicates the feasibility to determine @xmath3 from measurements in the strong - coupling limit @xcite .",
    "a particular limit is @xmath75 , which corresponds to a vanishing qubit splitting , @xmath76 . in this case",
    "it is obvious from hamiltonian that the coupling to the qubit merely entails a linear displacement of the oscillator coordinate , while the oscillator frequency remains unaffected .",
    "this limit is perfectly reproduced by our non - rwa result , irrespective of the coupling strength .",
    "the rwa result , by contrast , predicts a spurious frequency shift , indicating the failure of rwa .",
    "an experimentally relevant generalization of the model is the case of several qubits coupling to the same oscillator .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath77 where the index @xmath78 labels the qubits . as for the one - qubit case ,",
    "the rotating wave - approximation is frequently applied and yields the tavis - cummings hamiltonian @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 , cf .",
    "eq .  .",
    "we obtain for each qubit the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the dispersive limit is now determined by @xmath82 for all @xmath78 .",
    "effective decoupling of the qubits and the cavity to second order is then achieved via a transformation with the unitary operator @xmath83 , cf .",
    "the resulting dispersive hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath84 remarkably , the oscillator entails an effective coupling between the qubits with the strength @xmath85 which has already been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed to employ this interaction for building qubit networks @xcite and for generating qubit - qubit entanglement @xcite . moreover ,",
    "quantum tomography of a two - qubit state has been implemented by probing the cavity at its bare resonance frequency @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the oscillator frequency exhibits a shift depending on a collective coordinate of all qubits .",
    "consequently , the cavity response experiences a phase shift from the ingoing signal , which in turn contains information about that collective qubit coordinate .      as in sec .",
    "[ sec : dispn ] for the one - qubit case , we now extend the dispersive theory of the tavis - cummings model beyond rwa , taking into account the counter - rotating terms of the hamiltonian ( [ htcn ] ) . in analogy to transformation  ( [ transfone1 ] )",
    ", we employ the ansatz @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 . following the lines of sec .",
    "[ sec : dispn ] , i.e.  expanding the transformed hamiltonian to second order in @xmath31 and @xmath49 , we obtain the dispersive hamiltonian @xmath89 we have introduced the modified coupling strength @xmath90 which describes the effective interaction between qubits @xmath78 and @xmath91 , and represents the extension of eq .",
    "( [ jrwa ] ) beyond rwa .",
    "the dispersive shifts of the qubit and cavity frequencies , given by the second and third term of eq .",
    "( [ htcndisp ] ) , are equally modified as compared to the rwa result ( [ htcdisp ] ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the effective qubit - qubit interaction in eq .  ( [ htcndisp ] ) is of the ising type @xmath92 , whereas rwa predicts the isotropic xy interaction @xmath93 , see eq .",
    "( [ htcdisp ] ) .",
    "thus , the treatment beyond rwa predicts a qualitatively different effective model and not merely a renormalization of parameters .",
    "the ising term even persists in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , one can recover the rwa hamiltonian ( [ htcdisp ] ) by writing the interaction term as @xmath95 and performing a rwa for the ising coupling .",
    "this corresponds to discarding small - weighted , rapidly oscillating terms of the type @xmath96    the difference between the effective models and has some physically relevant consequences .",
    "first , in contrast to the rwa result , hamiltonian ( [ htcndisp ] ) does not conserve the number of qubit excitations , which will affect the design of two - qubit gates @xcite .",
    "moreover , both models possess different spectra , which influences entanglement creation .",
    "for instance , the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ htcndisp ] ) for two degenerate qubits ( @xmath97 ) coupled to one cavity is @xmath98 $ ] and thus exhibits qubit - qubit entanglement .",
    "by contrast , the corresponding ground state of the multi - qubit rwa hamiltonian ( [ htcdisp ] ) is the product state @xmath99 . for the case of the hamiltonian ( [ htcndisp ] ) , thermal qubit - qubit entanglement",
    "will consequently be present at zero temperature and even at thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we have generalized the dispersive theory for a qubit coupled to a harmonic oscillator to the case of far detuning . in this limit ,",
    "it is no longer possible to treat the qubit - oscillator interaction hamiltonian within the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "therefore , previous derivations need some refinement .",
    "it has turned out that diagonalizing the hamiltonian analytically up to second order in the coupling constant is possible as well beyond rwa .",
    "the central result is that as within rwa , the oscillator experiences a shift of its resonance frequency , the sign of the shift depending on the qubit state . in this respect",
    ", the difference between both approaches seems to be merely quantitative .",
    "nevertheless , our result implies an important fact for currently devised qubit - oscillator experiments with ultra - strong cavity - qubit coupling : dispersive qubit readout is possible as well in that regime .",
    "the comparison with numerical results has confirmed that our approach is quantitatively satisfactory in the whole dispersive regime .",
    "the corresponding treatment of many qubits coupled to the same oscillator is equally possible . in such architectures",
    ", the oscillator mediates an effective qubit - qubit interaction which may be used for gate operations and entanglement creation .",
    "we have revealed that the form of the effective interaction depends on whether or not one employs rwa .",
    "while rwa predicts an isotropic xy interaction , the inclusion of the counter - rotating terms yields an interaction of ising type .",
