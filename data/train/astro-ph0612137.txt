    "distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been used to probe the expansion rate of the universe out to redshifts of order 1.5 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these measurements were crucial in establishing the current standard model of cosmology in which roughly 30% of the energy density is in the form of non - relativistic matter , whereas roughly 70% is in the form of a dark energy , a component with negative pressure .",
    "the power of supernova surveys as cosmological probes depends on a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the individual supernovae - but the supernova host galaxies do not follow the hubble flow .",
    "they have peculiar velocities , induced by the underlying gravitational potential , and the measured luminosity distances and redshifts are perturbed in correlation with the large scale structure ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the measured fluctuations in the luminosity distances from nearby supernovae surveys can be related to the local variation in the hubble parameter @xcite , and the local large scale structure , and can be quantified in terms of their correlation functions .",
    "this possibility has been studied in several recent papers @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using analytical methods .",
    "@xcite detected the dipole term with respect to the cmb at roughly 2@xmath4 confidence .",
    "the variation of the monopole contribution with redshift was studied by @xcite using the same supernova sample as @xcite .",
    "in contrast to measurements of the density field , velocity field measurements are much less sensitive to selection bias , since the field is measured directly instead of summed up from number counting , but it is very sensitive to uncertainties in the measured luminosity distance . because of this type ia supernovae are particularly useful as probes of the velocity field because of the very small inherent uncertainty in their luminosity distance . compared with measurements using galaxies as standard candles much fewer supernovae",
    "are needed to get a reliable estimate of at least the lowest multipoles in the velocity field .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "the first is to perform a theoretical study of the problem of extracting the velocity field from supernova data .",
    "the second is to use the developed formalism on the best available data set to extract precise values of the dipole and quadrupole terms in the local velocity field .",
    "we first use large scale dark matter n - body models to predict the observed angular power spectrum of the peculiar radial velocity field as a function of redshift and to explore its utility to probe the local velocity field . by using this method",
    "we are able to quantify the effect of various error sources as well as cosmic variance .",
    "we also use the @xcite ( hereafter jrk ) sample of nearby type ia supernovae to calculate the lowest multipoles of the local velocity field .",
    "we find that both the dipole and the quadrupole terms are well measured by this sample .",
    "higher multipoles can not be reliably estimated with the jrk sample because of sparse sampling . in @xcite",
    "this sample was also used to probe the monopole term in an analysis similar to that of @xcite .",
    "similar evidence of a local void was found in @xcite , even taking a data set which is completely disjoint from that in @xcite . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the dipole and quadrupole terms in the jrk sample since the monopole has already been exhaustively discussed in @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the formalism used to derive the velocity field from magnitude measurements . in section 3",
    "we present the analysis tools used to extract the multipole components of the velocity field from a finite sample of supernovae . in section 4",
    "we use catalogues from n - body simulations to study the expected properties of the velocity field , including the precision with which it can be probed by supernova surveys .",
    "we apply the same formalism to the jrk sample and provide a detailed discussion of the results in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 contains a comparison with other measurements of the local velocity field , and in section 7 we provide our conclusions .    in the following",
    "we will take @xmath5 .",
    "the luminosity distance , @xmath6 , to a supernova at redshift @xmath7 is given by the definition @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the observed flux and @xmath10 the luminosity , or equivalently by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the apparent and @xmath13 the absolute magnitude .",
    "the angular - diameter distance , @xmath14 , to the same supernova is defined as @xmath15    in a homogeneous and isotropic universe the two distance measures , @xmath6 and @xmath14 , are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 0.2 cm by taking the logarithmic derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : da1 ] ) with respect to @xmath18 in the special case of a flat universe ( @xmath19 ) we obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21    however , in a perturbed universe , the luminosity distance depends on the detailed trajectory of the individual photons from the supernova to the observer . at moderately high redshifts ( @xmath22 ) the contribution arising from lensing by intervening matter dominates , while at low redshifts ( @xmath23 ) the contribution from the peculiar velocities of the supernova host galaxy relative to the observer dominates . in this paper",
    "we are only concerned with the local universe . from now on we will therefore only consider the contribution from the peculiar velocities in determining distances . for a given supernova and observer , each with some peculiar velocity ,",
    "the measured redshift @xmath7 , angular - diameter distance , @xmath14 , and luminosity distance , @xmath6 , are modified according to @xcite @xmath24 where by definition @xmath25 a bar @xmath26 indicates the quantities as measured in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , and @xmath27 is the velocity of the supernova projected along the direction from the observer to the supernova .",
    "having measured the redshift , @xmath7 , and the flux , @xmath9 , of the supernova we can calculate the luminosity distance , @xmath6 , and the angular - diameter distance , @xmath14 , to within a scatter determined by the cosmic variance on the luminosity , @xmath10 , of a supernova . as we know the peculiar velocity , @xmath28 , of the observer with respect to the cmb with great accuracy it is useful to collect all known quantities on the left hand side of the three equations : @xmath29 the three quantities @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the redshift , angular - diameter distance , and luminosity distance as measured and calculated by an observer at rest with respect to the cmb . in the following",
    "we assume that the measured quantities all have been corrected to a frame at rest with respect to the cmb .",
    "the measured redshift , @xmath30 , is most transparently split into the cosmological redshift , @xmath33 , and the radial velocity of the supernova , @xmath34 , by inverting eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) to find @xmath33 , which is then inserted into this alternative form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) : @xmath35    it is also possible to begin with eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) to obtain the cosmological redshift , @xmath33 , in terms of the measured redshift , @xmath30 , and the radial velocity , @xmath36 , of the supernova : @xmath37 we now expand the natural logarithm of the angular - diameter distance , @xmath38 , to first order around the measured redshift , @xmath30 , and by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 for a flat universe is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "this equation applies equally well for the luminosity distance , so we can give a common formula for both distance measures : @xmath41 this expression can easily be transformed into an equation between the measured apparent magnitude , @xmath42 , the calculated apparent magnitude , @xmath43 , at the measured redshift , @xmath30 , and the peculiar radial velocity , @xmath36 , of the supernova : @xmath44 inverting this equation for the special case of a flat universe we obtain @xmath45 for low redshift supernovae the hubble parameter , the angular - diameter distance , and the luminosity distance can all be expanded in terms of the deceleration parameter , @xmath46 : @xmath47 when we insert these values into eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr1 ] ) we obtain the radial velocity of a low redshift supernova @xmath48 in this approximation the distance modulus , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 where the hubble constant as usual is given as @xmath51 .",
    "the distance modulus defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr2 ] ) should be compared with the distance modulus , @xmath52 , as measured in a frame at rest with respect to the cmb .",
    "the difference between the apparent magnitude @xmath42 and the one measured by the observer , @xmath12 , is according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) , @xmath53 the approximate equation ( [ eq : approxvr ] ) is sufficient for the low redshifts that we are considering , while at higher redshifts one has to use the correct form eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr1 ] ) , and also take into account other contributions to @xmath54 , such as lensing .",
    "we analyse both the mock catalogues discussed in the next section and the real data set ( see section [ sec : data ] ) using the same technique . in practice we decompose the field into spherical harmonics .    the radial velocity is a real scalar field , and on a spherical shell of a given redshift it can be decomposed into spherical harmonics @xmath55 using @xmath56 for the expansion of a real function and @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58+a_{l0}y_{l0}\\right\\rbrace           \\\\ \\nonumber      & = & \\sum_{l = 0}^\\infty\\left\\lbrace \\sum_{m=1}^{l}\\left[2\\re(a_{lm})\\re(y_{lm})-                                             2\\im(a_{lm})\\im(y_{lm})\\right ]            + a_{l0}y_{l0}\\right\\rbrace\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , this applies strictly only if the field can be measured on the entire sphere . in our case",
    "the radial velocity field is measured for a finite number of directions , so we can only hope to determine a finite number of @xmath59 coefficients by fitting a truncated multipole expansion by the method of weighted linear least squares using @xmath60 $ ] as basis functions .",
    "specifically , we solved the problem by a singular value decomposition .",
    "we follow the procedure by @xcite and represent the @xmath61th multipole in terms of a scalar , @xmath62 and @xmath61 unit vectors , @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the sum of all possible traces of the first term . in this representation the multipole expansion up to and including the quadrupole term takes the following form : @xmath67 note that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are `` headless '' vectors only defining a line , not a direction .",
    "equivalently they define a plane , but they do not define a rotation in that plane , so the normal to the plane is also headless . by convention",
    "we choose as the first vector , @xmath70 , the one with the largest absolute z - coordinate .",
    "we can choose @xmath70 to point to the hemisphere near the pole without introducing a negative amplitude @xmath71 , if both @xmath70 and @xmath72 have their sign changed .",
    "finally we define the normal to the plane spanned by the two vectors as @xmath73 .",
    "this is the _ polar quadrupole vector_.    from the @xmath59 coefficients the monopole amplitude can be found as @xmath74 and the dipole amplitude and direction can be found as @xmath75 this is the direction of the maximum of the dipole .",
    "all the higher order multipole vectors are found by using the program mpd_decomp by @xcite .    for the lowest @xmath61-values the amplitudes in the multipole vector expansion",
    "are related to the usual power @xmath76 as @xcite @xmath77 ^ 2 \\\\ c_1&=&\\frac{4\\pi}{9 } \\left [ a^{(1 ) } \\right]^2 \\\\ c_2&=&\\frac{4\\pi}{75 } \\left [ a^{(2 ) } \\right]^2\\left [ 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\hat{v}^{(2,1)}\\cdot\\hat{v}^{(2,2)}\\right)\\right ] \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it should be noted that in general the individual multipole coefficients obtained in the fit to data can be strongly dependent on the number of modes included .",
    "the reason for this is that the window function does not cover the entire sky , rather there are patches with zero coverage .",
    "this means that the spherical harmonics are no longer orthogonal , and shows up as a leakage of power between different @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , this is predicted to be a significant problem for any harmonic analysis with limited sampling because the higher order multipoles do contribute significantly to the rms velocity . in section [ sec : window ] we discuss the implications of sampling for the jrk sample .",
    "before analysing existing data we make mock catalogues of supernova data based on dark matter n - body simulations . this",
    "is done in order to get an estimate of the various sources of error in such measurements .",
    "the n - body simulations were done using the gadget-2 code @xcite with a box size of @xmath78 and @xmath79 & @xmath80 particles respectively to make synthetic realisations .",
    "the box size is chosen large enough that the periodic nature of the box does not impact the simulation at the scales ( @xmath81 , or @xmath82 ) we are interested in , and the high resolution run is made to assure that our results are not dependent on the numerical resolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mollview ] is shown a typical all sky map in mollweide projection of the peculiar velocity field at redshifts @xmath83 , computed in the cmb rest frame .",
    "the formation rate of sne ia as a function of the environment is not well known , though there are indications that at low redshifts the rate is directly proportional to the stellar mass , and insensitive to the metalicity @xcite ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for indications of a bimodal distribution ) . on the other hand the semi - analytic estimates in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assume a rate which is uniform on the sky .",
    "this is clearly not realistic , but to test the effect on the luminosity distance distributions we have made synthetic data sets using both a rate proportional to the mass and an uniform distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sniahisto ] we show the distribution of peculiar radial velocities in the two models .",
    "the differences between the two scenarios are at a percent level .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : mollview ] we see that the radial velocity field is smooth across voids in contrast to e.g.  scalar fields like the density field .",
    "this is because it is only a pseudo - scalar , and the underlying vector field can be transported efficiently ( i.e.  it is easier to change the direction of a vector , than transport a scalar quantity ) .",
    "real measurements rely on a tracer of the matter distribution , whether it is galaxies or sn ia . in any case",
    ", only a finite number of objects will be available .",
    "furthermore there will be a selection bias coming from the presence of galactic foregrounds etc . in this work",
    "we generate a mock supernova survey using the following strategy :    _ a ) _ the total number of measured sne in a redshift bin , @xmath84 , is chosen .",
    "_ b ) _ each sn is generated by sampling one of the two probability distributions described in the previous section .    _ c ) _ to each sn a noise component is added , resulting from scatter in the ( stretch corrected ) intrinsic luminosity , uncertainty in extinction correction , measurement errors etc .",
    "we describe the errors as a gaussian error with a spread of @xmath85 on the measured apparent magnitude of the sn .    from this data set the angular power spectrum",
    "is calculated . for each type of simulated survey",
    "this task is performed 500 times for 27 different observers , to find the mean and variance of the angular power spectrum .",
    "we choose a set of @xmath86 sne per bin in 16 redshift bins at redshifts of @xmath87 or equivalently with hubble flow velocities @xmath88 .",
    "this conforms roughly to the expectations from local supernova searches conducted today @xcite and in the near future @xcite , if they are binned into 3 or 4 redshift bins . in figs .",
    "[ fig : multipoles]-[fig : multipoles2 ] we show the evolution of the lowest multipoles as a function of @xmath7 for both models of the supernova distribution .",
    "the red line and error bars show how a hypothetical survey without any external error sources , @xmath89 , would perform .",
    "hence , the error here is only due to the finite number of sne that are used to probe the velocity field .",
    "the green line shows the same , but including a gaussian scatter of @xmath90 is included . using the 27 different realisations we can estimate the size of cosmic variance ( shaded blue area ) .    from the figures it is clear that with 100 homogeneous distributed sne per redshift bin both the dipole and the quadrupole can be measured out to a redshift of about 0.1 .",
    "furthermore for the synthetic observations , we know the underlying cosmology and the real hubble constant , and we can determine the monopole .",
    "in the case of real observations we can only measure the relative change .",
    "in other words the zero point is in principle only measurable asymptotically at high redshifts .",
    "looking at the red curve , we see that for all multipoles the power goes to zero at higher redshift , as the flow approach the background hubble flow .",
    "we also note that cosmic variance is very large in the monopole term .",
    "this indicates that the local `` hubble bubble '' phenomena , such as those found in @xcite , are not unlikely .",
    "the velocity amplitudes are positive definite , and including a gaussian scatter in the velocities , is adding uncorrelated noise to the ( synthetic ) observations .",
    "therefore the amplitudes of the multipoles , when errors are included , are overestimated .",
    "this error is per se hard to separate from the signal , but can trivially be beaten down by a better control of the intrinsic errors or increasing the number of sne per redshift bin . given an observational data set synthetic observations with a realistic sky distribution should be used to separate the noise amplitude from the underlying velocity field .",
    "in accordance with the underlying velocity distribution ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sniahisto ] ) , on average there is a 5% overestimation of the radial velocity amplitudes , when assuming the sn ia rate is proportional to mass compared to a uniform distribution .",
    "we apply the analysis technique described in section [ sec : analysis ] to the sample of 133 nearby supernovae obtained by jrk .",
    "the jrk sample includes 95 type ia supernovae in the hubble flow , with an intrinsic dispersion of less than @xmath91 in distances .",
    "this is the best sample available with distances derived in a homogeneous way , by using the multicolor light curve shape ( mlcs2k2 ) method described in @xcite .",
    "this method is one of several others used to standardise supernova distances , but is particularly powerful in that it allows a disentangled correction for host galaxy extinction and also provides a statistically reliable way to estimate the errors .",
    "the entire jrk sample comprises 133 supernovae .",
    "we have selected 3 sub samples of these for our analysis .",
    "we followed @xcite in selecting as the first sub sample 95 hubble flow supernovae , the _ hf sample _ , a selection based on distance cut , requirement of an acceptable light curve fit and excluding objects with very high extinction .",
    "the sne in this sample have redshifts between @xmath92 and @xmath93 and a weighted average redshift of @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "the second sub sample , the _ 4500 sample _ , includes 74 sne , and is similar to the hf sample , but without the highest redshift sne and including a few sne with a lower redshift .",
    "it has an weighted average of @xmath96 or @xmath97 and contains sne with redshift between 0.007 and 0.035 . the last sub sample , the _ 3500 sample _ , includes 42 sne , and is similar to the 4500 sample , but without the highest redshift sne .",
    "it has an weighted average of @xmath98 or @xmath99 and contains sne with redshift between 0.007 and 0.017 .    to the uncertainties in the distance moduli",
    ", we also add in quadrature an additional error of 0.08 mag in order to properly represent the final uncertainties following @xcite .",
    "in addition we add @xmath100 in quadrature to the errors in the radial velocity in order to take the velocity dispersion around the local anisotropic hubble flow into account .",
    "@xcite find that the radial velocity dispersion around the local ( anisotropic ) hubble flow within @xmath101 mpc amounts to only @xmath102 , when distance errors are taken into account . for further details on the samples we refer to @xcite .      in fig",
    "[ fig : wf ] we show the distance to the nearest supernova on the sky , measured in degrees , for all points on the sphere .",
    "the sample has good coverage , except for a few `` holes '' mainly defined by the galactic disk .",
    "the mean distance to the nearest supernova is @xmath103 , but the maximum distance is @xmath104 at @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "there are three areas with distance larger than @xmath107 , roughly centred on @xmath108 , and @xmath109 respectively . for a given @xmath61 ,",
    "the distance between zero points in the field is @xmath110 .",
    "if the largest holes in the sample have a size of @xmath111 then the multipole decomposition becomes problematic around @xmath112 .",
    "for the present sample this corresponds to @xmath113 so that the quadrupole can be robustly fitted , but not the octupole .",
    "we have tested this in practice . when the quadrupole is added , the monopole and dipole amplitudes and the dipole direction hardly change . however , when the octupole is included there is serious leakage of power from the lower @xmath61 s to @xmath114 and the results change substantially .",
    "the reason is that the fit in the well - sampled regions can be improved by adding the additional 7 @xmath115 coefficients to the fit , but that this happens at the expense of very large changes in the unsampled regions . in order to probe the higher order",
    "multipoles it is essential to reduce the size of the voids in the sample . for a uniformly distributed sample of 95 supernovae the average distance to the nearest supernova",
    "is 10.4 degrees , nearly the same as in the jrk sample .",
    "however , the average maximum distance is 30.1 degrees , significantly lower than in our sample .",
    "a uniform sample of 95 supernovae could be used to probe @xmath114 robustly . for a uniform sample the average distance to the nearest supernova scales as @xmath116 , and the average maximum distance in the sample roughly as @xmath117 .      in figs .",
    "[ fig:3500sample]-[fig : hfsample ] we show the obtained 68% and 95% contours for the direction of the dipole and quadrupole vectors in galactic coordinates . the corresponding best fit values with their formal 68% errors are shown in tables [ table : dipole ] and [ table : quadrupole ] .",
    "this result can be compared to other velocity surveys based on galaxy samples .",
    "the recent review by @xcite summarises these surveys . at an effective depth of 4000 @xmath0",
    "they find that the dipole amplitude is @xmath118 in direction @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the 3500 and 4500 samples both show a dipole in a direction compatible with the great attractor region at @xmath121 , @xmath122 . for the hf sample the direction shifts to slightly higher @xmath123 , compatible with a shift in the motion towards the shapley concentration ( which lies at an average distance of 14000 @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at slightly higher galactic latitude .",
    "furthermore the amplitude of the dipole decreases , as is expected from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "for all the three sub samples we find a relatively large contribution from the quadrupole , showing that the local flow has a significant shear component .",
    "the result is consistent in magnitude with the expectation from the monte carlo simulations . from the figures",
    "it can also be seen that there is a change in quadrupole direction with redshift , and that the distributions for the 3500 and 4500 samples are bimodal .",
    "this could be because the quadrupole is pointing in different directions at the lower and higher end of the included redshift range of the sne , and hence for the 3500 sample the bimodality is more apparent . even though we quote formal 68% errors in table 2",
