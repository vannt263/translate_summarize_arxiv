    "stochastic modelling is often the most effective tool available in order to describe complex systems in physical , biological and social networks @xcite . in particular , since natural noise sources are mostly gaussian , stationary and non - stationary gaussian processes are often used to model the response of a system exposed to environmental noise . in view of the increasing interest towards complex systems ,",
    "a question thus naturally arises on whether an effective characterization of gaussian processes is achievable .    in this paper",
    "we address the characterization of classical random fields and focus attention on fractional gaussian processes .",
    "the reason is twofold : on the one hand , most of of the noise sources in nature are gaussian and the same is true for the linear response of systems exposed to environmental noise @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "fractional processes have recently received large attention since they are suitable to describe noise processes leading to complex trajectories , e.g. irregular time series characterized by a haussdorff fractal dimension in the range @xmath0 . in particular , in order to maintain the discussion reasonably self contained , we focus on systems exposed to fractional brownian noise @xcite ( fbn ) @xmath1 , which is a paradigmatic nonstationary gaussian stochastic process with zero mean @xmath2_b=0 $ ] and covariance @xcite @xmath3_b & \\equiv k(t , s ) \\notag \\\\   & = \\frac12 v_h\\left(|t|^{2h } +     \\label{bh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 @xmath5 being the euler gamma function . in",

    "the characterization of fbn amounts to the determination of the fractal dimension of the resulting trajectories , i.e. the determination of the parameter @xmath6 . in the following , in order to simplify notation and formulas , we will employ the complementary hurst parameter @xmath15 $ ] and upon replacing @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) , we will denote the fbn process by @xmath17    the purpose of this paper is to address in some details the characterization of fbn , i.e. the determination of the parameter @xmath18 , using _",
    "quantum probes_. this means that we consider a system , say a particle , subject to fbn , and assume that its motional degree of freedom , regarded to be classical , is coupled to a quantum degree of freedom of the same system , e.g. its spin .",
    "we then ignore the noisy classical part and exploit quantum limited measurements on the spin part to extract information about the fbn .",
    "notice , however , that our approach and our results are also valid to assess the performances of quantum limited measurements for any two - level system subject to dephasing perturbations described by fractional brownian noise , i , e . without the need of referring to a qubit coupled to the motion of a particle .",
    "we will address both _",

    "several techniques have been suggested for the estimation of the hurst parameter in the time or in the frequency domain @xcite , or using wavelets @xcite . among them",

    "offers the advantage of requiring measurements performed at a fixed single ( optimized ) instant of time , without the need of observing the system for a long time in order to collect a time series , and thus avoiding any issue related to poor sampling @xcite .",
    "as we will see , quantum probes may be effectively employed to characterize fractional gaussian process when the the system - environment coupling is weak , provided that a long interaction time is achievable , or when the coupling is strong and the quantum probe may be observed shortly after that the interaction has been switched on .",
    "overall , and together with results obtained for the characterization of stationary process @xcite , our results indicate that quantum probes may represent a valid alternative to other techniques to characterize classical noise .",

    "<S> we address the characterization of classical fractional random noise via quantum probes . in particular , we focus on estimation and discrimination problems involving the fractal dimension of the trajectories of a system subject to fractional brownian noise . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the classical degree of freedom exposed to the environmental noise is coupled to a quantum degree of freedom of the same system , e.g. its spin , and exploit quantum limited measurements on the spin part to characterize the classical fractional noise . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , our approach may be applied to any two - level system subject to dephasing perturbations described by fractional brownian noise , in order to assess the precision of quantum limited measurements in the characterization of the external noise . in order to assess the performances of quantum probes we evaluate the bures metric , as well as the helstrom and the chernoff bound , and optimize their values over the interaction time . </S>",
    "<S> we find that quantum probes may be successfully employed to obtain a reliable characterization of fractional gaussian process when the coupling with the environment is weak or strong . in the first case decoherence </S>",
    "<S> is not much detrimental and for long interaction times the probe acquires information about the environmental parameters without being too much mixed . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for strong coupling information is quickly impinged on the quantum probe and can effectively retrieved by measurements performed in the early stage of the evolution . in the intermediate situation , </S>",
    "<S> none of the two above effects take place : information is flowing from the environment to the probe too slowly compared to decoherence , and no measurements can be effectively employed to extract it from the quantum probe . </S>",
    "<S> the two regimes of weak and strong coupling are defined in terms of a threshold value of the coupling , which itself increases with the fractional dimension . </S>"
