    "in recent years it has been established , to a very reasonable level of confidence , that the universe is spatially flat and is composed of @xmath4 per cent ordinary mater , @xmath5 per cent dark matter and @xmath6 per cent dark energy .",
    "this state of affair is summarized in the cosmological concordance @xmath7cdm model @xcite .",
    "the dominant component , dark energy , is believed to be the same thing as the cosomlogical constant introduced by einstein in @xmath8 which in turn is believed to originate in the energy of the vacuum @xcite .",
    "we note that dark energy is characterized mainly by a negative pressure and no dependence on the scale factor and its density behaves as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter and @xmath9 is the planck mass @xcite .",
    "more precisely we have ( with @xmath10 ) @xmath11 the reality of the energy of the vacuum is exhibited , as is well known , in a dramatic way in the casimir force .",
    "see for example @xcite for a systematic presentation of this subject .",
    "in this article we will adopt the usual line of thought outlined in @xcite and identify dark energy with vacuum energy .    the calculation of vacuum energy in curved spacetimes such as flrw universes and de sitter spacetime requires the use of quantum field theory in the presence of a non zero gravitational background @xcite .",
    "de sitter spacetime is of particular interest since we know that both the early universe as well as its future evolution is dominated by vacuum , i.e. flrw universes may be understood as a perturbation @xmath12 of de sitter spacetime which vanishes in the early universe as well as in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "the main difficulties in doing quantum field theory on curved background is the definition of the vacuum state and renormalization .    in an expanding de sitter spacetime and also in quasi de sitter",
    "spacetimes a natural choice of the vacuum is given by the so - called euclidean or bunch - davies state @xcite .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the vacuum energy in de sitter spacetime with the bunch - davies state behaves in the right way as @xmath14 where @xmath2 is the de sitter hubble parameter and @xmath15 is a physical cutoff introduced for example along the lines of @xcite . as discussed above flrw spacetimes may be treated as quasi de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the usual in - out formalism may then be used to extend the calculation of vacuum energy to these spacetimes @xcite .",
    "a more systematic and more fundamental approach to the calculation of vacuum energy in flrw spacetimes is based on the renormalization of quantum field theory in non - zero backgrounds .",
    "this is the approach we will discuss in this article which is inspired by the recent original work on the casimir force found in @xcite in which the starting point is a renormalizable quantum field theory in a non - zero background .",
    "the main ingredients of this approach are as follows :    * we reinterpret scalar field theory coupled to flrw metric as a scalar field theory in a flat spacetime interacting with a particular time - dependent ( effective graviton ) background .",
    "* we regularize and then renormalize the resulting scalar field theory for arbitrary backgrounds in the usual way .",
    "renormalization , if possible , removes all divergences from all proper vertices of the effective action .",
    "* we compute the vacuum energy for arbitrary backgrounds .",
    "* we substitute the particular background found in @xmath16 .",
    "* there is always the possibility that the vacuum energy still diverges for particular profiles of the background configuration .",
    "this is indeed the case for the casimir force @xcite as well as for the flrw spacetimes considered here .",
    "we thus regularize with a cutoff to obtain an estimate for the vacuum energy .",
    "although we think that this approach is novel , potential and possible overlap with other approaches is certainly expected .",
    "a systematic investigation of this point is still underway .",
    "in the following we will be interested in spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universes with line elements given by    @xmath17    the @xmath18 are the comoving coordinates , @xmath19 is the conformal time and @xmath20 is the scale factor .",
    "the action of a real massless scalar field coupled to this metric is given by @xmath21 the scalar curvature is given by @xmath22 where the prime stands for the derivation with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "the path integral and the expectation values of the theory are @xmath23 we perform the change of variable @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the comoving field .",
    "the action @xmath26 becomes    @xmath27    the path integral and the expectation values of the theory in terms of @xmath25 are @xmath28 in general @xmath29 .",
    "we can check for example that the hamiltonians in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath25 , which are defined using the stress - energy - momentum tensor in the usual way , are related by @xmath31.\\label{fundamental}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second moment is defined by @xmath32 the goal now is to compute @xmath33 and @xmath34 . this requires the quantization of the scalar field @xmath25 in a time dependent ( effective graviton ) background @xmath35",
    "the action is of course given by ( [ actionchi ] ) which can also be rewritten including a mass @xmath36 for the field @xmath25 as    @xmath37    in the following we will first assume an arbitrary background and then substitute the particular background ( [ sub ] ) at the end .",
    "it is natural to expect that uv divergences arise in the quantum theory which warrants therefore regularization and renormalization .",
    "the theory given by the action ( [ actions ] ) is renormalizable .",
    "in fact it can be used to construct an inductive proof for the renormalizability of phi - four theory @xcite .",
    "we observe that only the @xmath38point and the @xmath0point functions are superficially divergent in the theory given by the action ( [ actions ] ) .",
    "all higher order correlation functions are finite .",
    "we will use dimensional continuation as a regulator . despite the fact that the energy is time dependent in our case as opposed to the casimir energy a counter term of the form @xmath39 along the lines of @xcite is sufficient to remove all divergences . thus in order to renormalize the theory we add the counterterm action @xmath40 in the spirit of normal ordering instead of computing @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] we compute the shift in these expectation values with the respect to the case with zero background @xcite .",

    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the fourier transforms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively defined by ( with @xmath53 ) @xmath54 the diagrammatic expansion of @xmath49 and @xmath50 is given by the sum of all one - loop feynman diagrams with at least one external leg @xmath55 .",
    "see figure ( [ graph ] ) .",
    "both the @xmath38 and @xmath0point functions contributions to @xmath49 are divergent at @xmath56 while only the @xmath38point function contribution to @xmath50 is divergent at @xmath56 .",
    "we note that the @xmath38point function contribution to @xmath49 is also divergent for @xmath57 .        in order to subtract the divergences arising in this theory",
    "we need to tune the counterterms @xmath58 and @xmath59 introduced ( [ ct ] ) appropriately . in our case here we will employ a combination of modified minimal subtraction and renormalization conditions .",
    "we introduce a mass scale @xmath60 and require that the @xmath38point proper vertex @xmath61 vanishes at this scale , viz @xmath62 we also require that the @xmath0point proper vertex @xmath63 vanishes at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , viz @xmath66 in the case of a time independent background configuration this reduces to the usual condition @xmath67 .",
    "the mass scale @xmath60 in the above two equations may not be necessarily the same .    by computing the @xmath38point and the @xmath0point functions , taking into account the counterterms and imposing the above renormalization conditions we obtain after some calculation the values of the counterterms .",

    "we end up with the result @xmath71 & = & \\frac{1}{32\\pi^2 } \\int_0 ^ 1 ds_1\\int_0^{1-s_1}ds_2\\int_{k_2}\\bigg[\\ln \\frac{\\delta}{s_2(s_2 - 1)\\mu^2}+\\frac{\\delta^{'}}{\\delta}\\bigg]\\tilde{\\sigma}(-k_2+p)\\tilde{\\sigma}(k_2)+o(\\sigma^3).\\label{x1x2x3}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the second important observation is that the same counterterm @xmath59 given by ( [ ct2 ] ) is sufficient to cancel the divergence arising in the @xmath38point function contribution to @xmath50 .",

    "as a phenomenological application let us use the above formulas to estimate the vacuum energy density in de sitter spacetime and in flrw spacetimes thought of as perturbed de sitter spacetime . for simplicity we will only use the leading correction given by the tadpole diagram and as a consequence only @xmath50 contributes to the vacuum energy @xmath77 .",
    "in the remainder we will take the scale factor to be given by the ansatz @xmath78 for @xmath79 we obtain precisely de sitter spacetime .",
    "this is the unperturbed solution .",
    "we will think of the flrw universe given by the scale factor ( [ scale ] ) as a perturbation of de sitter spacetime in the following sense . in all inflationary models",
    "the early exponential expansion of the universe corresponds to a spacetime which is very close to de sitter spacetime . in the language of the @xmath80matrix the `` in '' solution",
    "is therefore de sitter spacetime in the infinite past @xmath81 . on the other hand observations of distant supernovae",
    "indicate that the universe is currently undergoing accelerated expansion driven by a small positive cosmological constant .",
    "by excluding the possibility of recollapse we can argue that vacuum energy will dominate over matter in the limit @xmath13 and thus flrw universe will approach de sitter spacetime in this limit @xcite .",
    "the `` out '' solution is therefore also de sitter spacetime in the infinite future @xmath82 .",
    "the interaction potential which connects between the `` in '' and `` out '' solutions is essentially given by the function @xmath12 in equation ( [ scale ] ) .",

    "spacetime the vacuum energy reduces to @xmath93 this expression is well defined in the infrared limit @xmath94 but divergent in the ultraviolet limit @xmath95 .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that the fourier transform of the effective graviton configuration given by @xmath96 does not vanish sufficiently fast for large momenta .",
    "let us then introduce a hard comoving cutoff @xmath7 .",
    "we are then interested in the integral @xmath97 the comoving cutoff @xmath7 is related to the physical cutoff @xmath15 by @xmath98 @xcite . since on de sitter @xmath99",

    "corrections due to deviation from a perfect de sitter spacetime are of order @xmath12 while corrections due to the contribution of the @xmath0point function are of the order of @xmath115 . a quantitative discussion of these effects will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",

    "this calculation is based on the renormalization of quantum field theory in non - zero ( effective graviton ) backgrounds in analogy with the recent treatment of the casimir force found in @xcite .",
