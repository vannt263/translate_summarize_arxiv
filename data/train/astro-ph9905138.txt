    "the bulk of the observed x - ray emission from galaxy clusters is due to thermal bremsstrahlung in a hot gas ( @xmath10 ) enriched in heavy elements . in the past two decades",
    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of the abundances of heavy elements ( mostly iron ) in the intracluster medium ( hereafter icm ) . from the hot x - ray emitting intergalactic gas in clusters of galaxies a universal abundance of iron of roughly 1/3",
    "solar has been derived ( renzini 1997 and references therein ; fukazawa et al .",
    "attempts to explain this icm iron abundance can be traced back to the early 1970s , when for the first time the iron - emission line in the x - ray spectra of clusters of galaxies was discovered ( mitchell et al .",
    "1976 ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "some interpreted the presence of iron in the icm to be due to gas ejected from galaxies , either by means of galactic winds or ram pressure stripping ( gunn and gott 1972 ; larson and dinerstein 1975 ; vigroux 1977 ; de young 1978 ; sarazin 1979 ; himmes and biermann 1980 ; matteucci and vettolani 1988 ; renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; matteucci and gibson 1995 ; gibson and matteucci 1997 ) , while others suggested pregalactic objects such as population iii stars as the origin ( white and rees 1978 ) .",
    "recently , thanks to the results obtained with the asca satellite , more detailed observations of iron and @xmath0-element abundances in local galaxy clusters are becoming available . before the launch of asca ,",
    "spectroscopic measures of elements such as si and s were known for the perseus cluster ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1981 ) and a576 ( rothenflug et al . 1984 ) , indicating that the abundances of these elements as well as that of iron are roughly solar , although their level of accuracy did not allow one to make strong statements about possible differences between the @xmath0-elements and iron . concerning oxygen",
    "there were only a few of measures of the o viii line in virgo and perseus ( canizares et al .",
    "1988 ) indicating a higher than solar [ o / fe ] .",
    "more recent measurements from asca by mushotzky et al .",
    "( 1996 ) implied @xmath4 \\approx$ ] + 0.2-+0.3 dex , thus indicating a general overabundance of @xmath0-elements relative to iron in the icm .",
    "we derived from the mushotzky data an average @xmath11 ( we estimated a formal statistical uncertainty and no systematic effect ) .",
    "this value corresponds ( by adopting the photospheric abundances of anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) ) to [ o / fe]@xmath12 dex .",
    "this means , by considering the errors , a marginal ( if any ) overabundance of oxygen relative to iron .",
    "the average si / fe ratio estimated from mushotzky data is @xmath13 corresponding to [ si / fe]= @xmath14 dex , which agrees with the same ratio obtained by fukazawa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their analysis of about 40 nearby poor and rich clusters .",
    "in fact , from this latter compilation of data we derived @xmath15 for clusters with @xmath16 kev ( we consider these clusters as rich according to our definition in tab .",
    "2 ) and @xmath17 for clusters with @xmath18 kev ( poor clusters ) .    ishimaru and arimoto ( 1997a , b ) and arimoto et al . ( 1997 ) claimed that the present uncertainties both on the assumed solar abundances ( used to derive the quantity [ o / fe ] ) and on the derived x - ray abundances are consistent with almost solar values of the @xmath4 $ ] ratios in the icm .",
    "in particular , the use of the meteoritic abundances for the sun ( anders and grevesse 1989 ) instead of the photospheric ones used in the previous studies , would reduce the @xmath4 $ ] values quoted above by @xmath19 dex ( ishimaru & arimoto 1997a , b ; renzini 1977 ) .    therefore , we consider all of these observational results still preliminary and subject to variation .    concerning the evolution of the abundances and abundance ratios as a function of redshift",
    "very little is known at the moment . however , preliminary results by mushotzky and lowenstein ( 1997 ) seem to indicate no evolution in the fe abundance for @xmath20 .",
    "in this paper we study the chemical evolution of the icm , in particular we predict the evolution of fe and @xmath4 $ ] ratios as functions of redshift .",
    "this is because the value of the @xmath4 $ ] ratio as well as the fe abundance in the icm impose strong constraints on the evolution of the galaxies in clusters as well as on the roles of supernovae of different types in the enrichment of the icm , as discussed by renzini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) .",
    "since the heavy elements in the icm are likely to come from ellipticals , as shown by arnaud ( 1994 ) , it is important to explore different kinds of models for the evolution of ellipticals . in particular , we will use either a one - zone model ( matteucci and gibson 1995 , hereafter referred to as `` burst model '' ) and a multi - zone model ( martinelli et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter `` continuous model '' ) for elliptical galaxies . the continuous model , which predicts abundance gradients in ellipticals in very good agreement with the observed ones , assumes that the outermost regions of these galaxies experience early galactic winds whereas the innnermost ones keep an active , although low , star formation rate until late times .",
    "the physical reason for this resides in the fact that the binding energy of the gas is lower in the outermost galactic regions and this is supported by the observational finding of a correlation between metallicity and escape velocity in ellipticals ( carollo and danziger , 1994 ) .",
    "the late occurrence of galactic winds in the most internal regions of ellipticals , if true , will have an effect on the chemical evolution of the icm , certainly at variance with the predictions by models with only early winds ( matteucci and gibson 1995 ; gibson and matteucci , 1997 ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following .",
    "in section 2 we present the models and the computational method . in section 3",
    "the results are discussed and some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we use throughout the paper an adimensional hubble parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the mass in the form of specific chemical elements as well as the total gas masses ejected by the elliptical galaxies both at early and late galactic lifetimes into the icm , can be computed in detail once a chemical evolution model is assumed .",
    "two different models for the evolution of elliptical galaxies have been taken into account :    1 .   _ burst models _ , namely those with only one major episode of galactic wind which occurs simultaneously all over the galaxy ; 2 .   _",
    "continuous models _ , where the galactic wind starts at an early epoch in the most external regions of the galaxies and continues until the present time in the most internal ones .",
    "the burst model is the same as in matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) , where we direct the reader for details , in the case of the arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) imf .",
    "this is their best model and we refer to it as cwm .    the continuous wind model is described in martinelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where we direct the reader for details .",
    "the basic difference of this approach , relative to the model of matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) , is that the elliptical galaxy is divided in several shells not interacting . for each shell",
    "the potential energy of the gas is calculated and compared with the thermal energy of the gas due to supernova explosions .",
    "a galactic wind develops first in the outermost shells and then progressively in the most inner ones . an improved expression for the cooling time of sn ( of both types ) remnants as well as adetailed description of the potential energy of the gas",
    "are used in this model .",
    "the sn remnant cooling time strongly influences the occurrence of a galactic wind as well as the amount of energy that sne can transfer into the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in the cwm model ,",
    "a cooling time not dependent on time was used , whereas in the continuous models the cooling time depends on the gas density ( @xmath22 ) which is a function of time .    in both models , after the occurrence of a galactic wind it is assumed that star formation is no longer taking place , and the galaxy or the galactic region evolves passively after that . in the case of the continuous model , the innermost regions ( inside 30 pc )",
    "never develop a galactic wind and the star formation continues until late times although it is so low that it would be hardly detectable .",
    "the chemical evolution of the icm is caused by two different processes :    1 .",
    "in the burst model , galaxies begin to eject the gas only after the time of occurrence of a galactic wind ( @xmath23 ) , and this process lasts only for few @xmath24 years .",
    "the time @xmath23 is a function of the initial galactic mass which influences the potential well .",
    "therefore , when the time of the first occurrence of the galactic wind increases , namely when more and more massive galaxies achieve the conditions to develop a wind , the number of galaxies contributing to the enrichment of the icm also increases , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this type of evolution stops at the time @xmath25 , corresponding to the onset of the galactic wind for the galaxy with the highest mass considered .",
    "2 .   in the continuous models ,",
    "the icm evolution is caused by the gas ejected continuously by each galaxy after the time @xmath23 .",
    "this continuous ejection process , not present in the burst models , has the characteristic of acting also at low redshift and , in particular , now .",
    "the assumed imf is the same as in the burst model .",
    "we now elucidate , in some detail , how we have calculated the chemical abundances in the icm for several values of redshift , according to the two elliptical galaxy models described above .",
    "we computed the ejected masses of each element ( fe , si , o , and total gas ) as functions of several initial galactic masses ( the procedure we describe here can be also found in matteucci and vettolani , 1988 ) .",
    "we found that the relation between the generic chemical element @xmath26 and the initial galactic mass can be approximated by a power law :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 represents the mass ejected in the form of the chemical species @xmath26 by a galaxy of initial mass @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two constants ( that can be fixed by a least squares fit ) .",
    "we have normalized the relations ( 1 ) to a galaxy at the _ break _ of the luminosity function of a cluster ( schechter 1976 ) having a blue luminosity @xmath32 , absolute blue magnitude @xmath33 and total mass @xmath34 .    in particular :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 represents the mass ejected in the form of an element @xmath26 by the galaxy with mass @xmath34 .",
    ".age of the elliptical galaxies for several values of the redshift @xmath6 in the two cosmological models examined [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the evolution of the elliptical galaxies is considered in the framework of different cosmological models : a flat , scale invariant cdm cosmology with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and a vacuum dominated cdm model with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in all the models",
    "considered we set the galaxy formation epoch , @xmath42 , and their age @xmath43 gyr ( we consider the same age for all the galaxies in our code ) .",
    "the models are defined in table 3 .",
    "in this paper we have computed the evolution of the abundances of fe and @xmath0-elements in the icm of poor and rich clusters as a function of redshift under different cosmologies . to do that we have used two different models for the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies , which are the main contributors to the icm enrichment . in particular , we used a model where the galactic wind develops at the same time all over the galaxy ( the burst model ) and after that the galaxy evolves only passively not contributing any longer to the icm enrichment , and a model where galactic winds develop first at large galactocentric distances and then progressively later in the innermost zones ( continuous model ) .",
    "our results are shown in figures 2 - 7 , where the behaviour of the @xmath44 $ ] , @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] as functions of the redshift @xmath6 in the cases of burst models ( fig . 2 , 3 , 6 ) and continuous models ( fig .",
    "4 , 5 , 7 ) is indicated .",
    "it should be noted that the [ fe / h ] and the [ @xmath0/h ] abundances refer to the abundances expected in the total gas ejected by ellipticals and not mixed with the pristine gas in the cluster .",
    "previous calculations ( matteucci and vettolani , 1988 ; matteucci and gibson , 1995 ; gibson and matteucci 1997 ) have shown that while the predicted total iron mass ejected by ellipticals agrees with the observed iron mass in clusters the total mass of gas ejected from ellipticals is much lower than the observed total gas mass in clusters .",
    "this is interpreted as due to the fact that most of the gas in clusters should be pristine gas .",
    "the models presented here also predict a too small amount of ejected total gas as compared to the observed one . a larger production of total gas from galaxies",
    "can be obtained by adopting a steep faint end slope of the luminosity function .",
    "however , gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) showed that in this case the contribution of the dwarf ellipticals is at most @xmath47 of the total icm gas , so that the conclusion about most of the icm gas being pristine gas remains unaffected . in order to obtain the abundances in the icm",
    "we should rescale the abundances shown in figures 2 and 4 to the total observed mass of gas in a typical poor and a rich cluster by assuming that most of it is pristine gas . in order to compute the evolution of the abundances as a function of redshift we also assumed that the amount of pristine gas in the clusters did not change during the cluster lifetime , in agreement with the results of white et al .",
    "( 1993 ) which found that the baryon fraction in clusters should have been constant .    after doing that by taking @xmath48 as representative of the total gas of a rich cluster ( coma ) and @xmath49 as representative of a poor cluster ( virgo ) we found that , in order to represent the @xmath50_{icm}$ ] , the curves of figure 2 should be lowered by -1.48 and -1.35 dex for a rich and a poor cluster , respectively , whereas the curves of figure 4 should be lowered by -1.37 and -1.30 for a rich and a poor cluster , respectively .",
    "the present time iron abundance , @xmath51 , obtained in this way from the continuous models is in very good agreement with the observational estimates of the iron abundance in local clusters .",
    "in fact , the continuous models predict @xmath52 both for poor and rich clusters , whereas the burst model predicts a lower abundance ( @xmath53 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the abundance ratios [ @xmath0/fe ] are completely unaffected by the amount of gas in the clusters and therefore the abundance ratios in the gas ejected from ellipticals represent also the abundance ratios in the icm .",
    "for this reason we want to stress the importance of considering abundance ratios rather than absolute abundances .",
    "* we observe that in the burst models the chemical evolution of the icm stops entirely at @xmath54 when the cosmological parameters are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and at @xmath55 when @xmath37 , @xmath56 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "* in the case of continuous models there is a continuous evolution up to @xmath57 and negligible evolution from @xmath58 up to @xmath3 . *",
    "the predicted [ fe / h ] at the present time in the icm is in very good agreement with the observations ( 1/3 solar ) for the continuous models whereas the burst models predict a lower abundance .",
    "* for the @xmath4_{icm}$ ] ratios we predict @xmath4_{icm}>0 $ ] at @xmath3 in the burst models and @xmath4_{icm } \\le 0 $ ] at @xmath3 for the continuous models , the exact values of the @xmath4_{icm}$ ] ratio depending on the assumed cosmology . in particular , at @xmath59 we predict @xmath8_{icm } \\simeq + 0.27 \\div + 0.37 $ ] dex and @xmath9_{icm } \\simeq + 0.14 \\div + 0.15 $ ] dex for the bursts models and @xmath8_{icm } \\simeq -0.12 \\div -0.05 $ ] dex and @xmath9_{icm } \\simeq + 0.11 \\div + 0.13 $ ] dex for the continuous models .",
    "these values were derived by adopting the meteoritic solar abundances ( anders and grevesse , 1989 ) .",
    "+ in both cases ( different normalization to the solar abundances ) the predicted @xmath4_{icm}$ ] ratios at the present time are higher in the burst than in the continuous model .",
    "the main reason for this behaviour of the @xmath4_{icm}$ ] ratio in the two different cases is the fact that in the burst model the galactic wind develops at early times in all galaxies and therefore it is mainly enriched by the products of sne ii ( high @xmath4 $ ] ratio ) . on the other hand , in the continuous models",
    "the galactic wind continues to develop until the present time and therefore it is enriched also by the products of sne ia ( low @xmath4 $ ] ratio ) .",
    "this result is quite important since it depends uniquely on the evolution of the ellipticals and not on the particular history of the cluster evolution ( infall , etc .. ) as it is for absolute abundances .",
    "we note that the predicted present time @xmath9_{icm}$ ] ratios are larger than the present time @xmath8_{icm}$ ] for the continuous models .",
    "this is due to the different nucleosynthesis of si and o : o , in fact , is entirely produced by sne ii whereas si is mostly produced by sne ii but a fraction , not entirely negligible , arises from sne ia and this contributes to avoid that the si / fe ratio decreases too much , since the bulk of fe coming from sne ia is partly compensated by the si which comes also from sne ia .",
    "for this reason si is not the best @xmath0-element to be used to check the @xmath4 $ ] ratio , whereas mg and o should be preferred .",
    "+ finally , it is worth noting that these @xmath4_{icm}$ ] ratios have been obtined by adopting a flat imf in the galactic models ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these values are therefore upper values especially in the case of the continuous model , since the adoption of the salpeter imf ( @xmath61 ) would lead to lower present time values of these ratios , due to the larger contribution from type ia sne relative to type ii sne . * for both galactic models these results do not differ for rich or poor clusters . *",
    "the effect of a change in the cosmological parameters is a simple translation of the abundance ratios ( namely the @xmath4 $ ] ratios are lower by at most @xmath62 dex when @xmath39 than when @xmath37 ) .",
    "a change in the cosmology produces also a delay in the chemical evolution , in the sense that when @xmath37 the chemical evolution of the icm stops a little later than when @xmath39 .",
    "this is a consequence of the different correspondence between the redshift @xmath6 and the galactic age @xmath63 as shown in table 1 .    from the previous results we can conclude that if we want to see an evolution in the icm we have to be able to perform observations of abundances in very high redshift clusters ( at least @xmath64 ) . preliminary results from asca ( mushotsky and lowenstein , 1997 ) seem to indicate no evolution in the abundance of fe for @xmath65 in agreement with our results related to all models here considered",
    "therefore , on this basis alone we can not distinguish among the two models . concerning our predictions on the @xmath4_{icm}$ ] ratios , recent studies ( ishimaru and arimoto , 1997a , b ) adopting the meteoritic solar abundances of anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) as in this work , seem to favor a low value of this ratio in very good agreement with our continuous wind model predictions .",
