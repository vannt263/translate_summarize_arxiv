    "symmetric game is an important class of games .",
    "it has drawn a considerable attention from both game theoretical community and system scientists .",
    "there are several reasons for this : first of all , symmetry represents  fair \" . in real world , a fair game is more realistic and acceptable .",
    "that makes many commonly played games symmetric .",
    "for instance , rock - paper - scissors , prisoner s dilemma , hawk and dove , etc .",
    "are all symmetric .",
    "if more general types of symmetric games are considered , many other games such as battle of the sexes , matching pennies , etc .",
    "are also symmetric .",
    "secondly , symmetry can greatly simplify the representation and computation of game related issues @xcite .",
    "finally , symmetry may be related with certain other properties .",
    "for instance , it is well known that a finite symmetric boolean game , i.e. , a game with a common action set of size @xmath0 , is an exact potential game @xcite .",
    "the concept of symmetric games was firstly proposed by j. nash in his famous paper @xcite . lately",
    ", it has been developed into several classes of interesting games @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", there are two commonly recognized classes of symmetric games : ( 1 ) ordinary symmetric game ; ( 2 ) name - irrelevant symmetric game .",
    "the first one is very natural , which means all the payoffs are essentially the same . the second one is firstly proposed by peleg et al @xcite , based on a simple type of strategy permutations of nash @xcite .",
    "a new class of symmetric games was proposed in @xcite as the renaming symmetric game .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .    from mathematical point of view ,",
    "a symmetry means invariance under the action of certain group . roughly speaking ,",
    "a game is symmetric means its payoff functions are invariant under a permutation group , which is a subgroup of a symmetric group @xcite .",
    "linear representation of a group @xmath1 in a vector space @xmath2 is an isomorphism @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this representation not only makes the group action easily computable but also provides a framework to investigate certain properties of the action . in this paper",
    "we reveal for each symmetry of games its linear representation , which is the action of symmetric group or its subgroups on the structure vector of games .",
    "the structure vector of a game consists of the structure vectors of its payoff functions .    to construct and",
    "to investigate the linear representations of symmetric games the semi - tensor product ( stp ) of matrices becomes a main tool .",
    "stp of matrices is a newly developed matrix product @xcite .",
    "it is a generalization of conventional matrix product and keeps most properties of conventional matrix product remaining available .",
    "it has been successfully used for studying logical ( control ) systems .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "it has also been used to game theoretic control problems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "vector space structure of finite games is a key issue in this linear representation approach to symmetric games .",
    "a clear picture of vector space structure of finite games was firstly presented in @xcite .",
    "this vector space structure was then modified and merged into an euclidean space @xcite . in this paper a finite game @xmath4 with player set @xmath5 and strategy set @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,",
    "is simply considered as a point in @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "such a set is denoted by @xmath11}$ ] , which has the same topology and vector space structure as @xmath8 , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to deduce the linear representations for each of the aforementioned symmetries of finite games , considering as the action of symmetric group or its proper subgroups in the vector space @xmath11}\\sim { { \\mathbb r}}^s$ ] , which consists of the structure vectors of all payoff functions .",
    "then it is proved that a finite game @xmath4 is certain kind of symmetry , if and only if , its structure vector is invariant under the corresponding linear representation .",
    "this presentation gives an easy way to verify whether a finite game @xmath4 is of this kind of symmetry .",
    "moreover , the matrix form of linear representations provides a framework for investigating the properties of symmetric games and manipulating them .",
    "secondly , the relationship between certain symmetric games and potential games is investigated .",
    "we mainly focus on boolean games .",
    "the ordinary and renaming symmetric boolean games are proved to be potential games and the weighted symmetric boolean games are proved to be weighted potential games .",
    "thirdly , a special kind of boolean games , called the negation - symmetric boolean game , is defined and investigated .",
    "we prove that this kind of boolean games is also potential .",
    "it shows that ( generalized ) ordinary symmetry is sufficient for a boolean game to be potential , but it is not necessary .",
