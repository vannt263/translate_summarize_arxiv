    "some fundamental questions of modern physics relevant to the unification of gravity with the other fundamental interactions such as models involving vector and scalar gravitons and matter anti - matter symmetry ( cpt ) can be enlightened via experiments with antimatter @xcite .",
    "in particular , some quantum gravity models claim for possible violations of the equivalence principle of general relativity in antimatter @xcite .",
    "testing the validity of this principle is an important issue , and may involve measurements of the inertial and gravitational mass equality using different experimental settings , for example determining gravitational acceleration on cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the authors of the present paper are co - proponents of the aegis ( antimatter experiment : gravity , interferometry , spectroscopy ) experiment @xcite aiming to measure the earth gravitational acceleration @xmath2 on a cold and collimated antihydrogen @xmath3 beam .",
    "the production of cold antihydrogen bunches occurs in the charge transfer of a cloud of rydberg excited positronium atoms ( ps ) ( stored in a magnetic trap ) with a bunch of cold antiproton @xmath4 by means of the reaction @xmath5 @xcite . ps atoms and antiprotons are prepared inside a cryostat . here",
    "we will focus on the excitation at high quantum levels of the ps atomic cloud .",
    "the @xmath3 formation process has to be very efficient .",
    "the number antihydrogen atoms produced in the charge exchange reaction is expressed , with obvious notation , as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the overlap factor between the trapped @xmath8 and the ps cloud with transverse area @xmath9 .",
    "since the cross section @xmath10 depends on the fourth power of the principal quantum number @xmath0 of the excited ps @xcite ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the bohr radius ) , @xmath0 can be chosen to be in the range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 . as we shall see later",
    ", higher @xmath0 values should be avoided in order to reduce ionization losses due to stray fields and dipole - dipole interactions . incidentally ,",
    "the higher the @xmath0-value the longer the ps lifetime .",
    "positronium excitation to these high-@xmath0 levels ( the so - called rydberg levels ) can be obtained either via collisions or via photon excitation . in reference",
    "@xcite ps excitation was proposed and tested through cs excitation by light and a successive charge exchange reaction with positrons .",
    "we propose ( in the aegis experiment ) a direct ps excitation by a two step light excitation using two simultaneous laser pulses with different wavelengths .",
    "this excitation process should be very efficient , more controllable and of simpler and more compact experimental set up than the previous one .",
    "an efficient way of producing ps atoms is by letting positrons impinge on a proper porous silica surface @xcite .",
    "the ps exiting the target surface forms an expanding cloud at a temperature up to 100 k , and the cloud is constrained by a magnetic trap with a relatively strong field @xmath15 of about 1 tesla @xcite .",
    "ps atom resonances will then be broadened by doppler effect because the atoms have random velocities of the order @xmath16 at the 100 k reference temperature .",
    "moreover the sublevels of a rydberg excited state will be mixed and separated in energy by the motional stark effect and by linear and quadratic zeeman splitting .",
    "because of these effects the transition will be from ground or from a low  excited level to a broadened rydberg level  band .",
    "this last is in fact the relevant characteristic which distinguishes the ps laser excitation from the usual atomic excitation to rydberg levels ; therefore it requires a careful theoretical analysis and a suitable experimental setup .",
    "the characteristics of laser pulses in terms of power and spectral bandwidth must be tailored to the geometry , the rydberg level  band and the timing of the ps expanding cloud .",
    "the laser power must be enough to ensure the whole ps cloud excitation within a few nanoseconds .",
    "the interest on laser ps excitation started with theoretical studies on the delayed annihilation @xcite induced by excitation towards @xmath17 and @xmath18 states using nanosecond or longer pulses .",
    "subpicosecond pulses of very intense laser radiation were proposed and analyzed both for spectroscopic studies and for antihydrogen formation by the charge exchange process @xcite , calculating population deposition on low energy states essentially by two - photon absorption .",
    "generally , these studies did not consider rydberg states , nor the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the problem of ps rydberg excitation with nanosecond laser pulses in a magnetic environment was faced and experimentally performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 up to 19 , but in a different regime with respect to ours , as discussed below .    the photo  excitation of ps to the rydberg band requires photon energies close to 6.8 ev .",
    "laser systems at the corresponding wavelength ( @xmath19 nm ) are not commercially available , hence a two  step excitation was required .",
    "we are taking into consideration the transition from the ground state to @xmath1 state ( @xmath20 nm ) , and then to high@xmath0 levels ( @xmath21 nm ) .",
    "this choice seems more adequate than the other possible two step sequence @xmath22 and @xmath23 high-@xmath0 because the level @xmath24 has a three time shorter lifetime than the the @xmath1 level ( 3 ns against 10.5 ns ) and , in addition , population loss becomes dynamically relevant .",
    "the two photon excitation @xmath25 was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a commercial dye ",
    "prism laser ( optically pumped by the second harmonic of a q  switched nd : yag laser ) coupled to a third harmonic generator can provide the 205 nm photons for the first transition .",
    "the laser for the second transition is yet to be developed and it is being proposed for the aegis experiment @xcite . in the discussed two  photon excitation we must use a relatively high intensity pulse in order to have an efficient transition process . since one needs to avoid losses in the excited population due to the short lifetime of the intermediate levels , the pulse time length can not exceed a few nanoseconds ; their expected value is around 5 ns .",
    "we perform the calculation of the excitation process to relate the absorption probability rate to the laser power and its spectral bandwidth characteristics , using a suitable definition of transition saturation fluence .",
    "here we consider a simple theoretical model of ps excitation to calculate laser saturation fluence and useful bandwidth .",
    "the excitation of ps in high@xmath0 state is described as a cascade or a two - step transition : a first step by a resonant excitation from @xmath27 to @xmath1 , and a second step by a near resonant excitation from @xmath1 to high@xmath0 .",
    "the spectral profile of the two laser intensities is characterized by a gaussian function whose full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath28 is matched to a selected rydberg level ",
    "bandwidth around a definite @xmath0 state .",
    "the broad laser linewidths come along with a coherence time @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the central wavelength of the proper transition .",
    "this parameter turns out to be up to three orders of magnitude shorter than the average 5 ns duration of the laser pulses @xcite , hence we are operating with a completely incoherent excitation for both transitions .",
    "the detailed structure of the optical transition to high@xmath0 energy levels of positronium is dominated by :    * the doppler effect ; * the zeeman and motional stark effects ,    because their energy contribution is larger than hyperfine and spin ",
    "orbit splitting in the experimental conditions .",
    "however , the importance of these effects for the effective level structure is completely different for @xmath31 and for rydberg states .",
    "as we shall see , while the first transition is marginally affected by zeeman and stark effects , the high @xmath0 levels involved in the second transition are turned into energy bands by stark effect , strongly affecting the physics of the excitation .",
    "therefore we will treat the two transitions separately .",
    "the challenging problem of rydberg states of an atom moving in a magnetic field has attracted many experimental and theoretical researches @xcite .",
    "the ps atom is a special case because the first order zeeman effect , _",
    "i.e. _ the direct interaction between magnetic field and magnetic dipoles , only mixes ortho and para ps states with @xmath32 without affecting orbital quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "this interaction energy contribution amounts to @xmath33 ev for @xmath34  t ( much lower than the actual doppler broadening , see below ) , while the energy of @xmath35 states remain unchanged .",
    "the level mixing leads to the well known enhancement of the average annihilation rate of the ps thermal ground state @xmath26 @xcite , leaving in fact only the ortho  ps states with @xmath35 surviving in the ps cloud expanding from the silica converter . from the observation that the electric dipole selection rules for optical transitions impose conservation of spin quantum number , and",
    "that the broadband characteristics of our laser overlaps the zeeman splitting , we may conclude that in first approximation this effect does not play any role in the transition .",
    "thus we will concentrate our attention only on the dominant motional stark effect . as a final note we observe that the quadratic ( diamagnetic ) zeeman effect can be discarded because it gives an energy contribution only for higher magnetic fields and high @xmath0 ( being proportional to @xmath36 ) @xcite , hence in a regime where the motional stark effect dictates the transition structure .",
    "since doppler and stark effects depend on temperature , in the following calculations we select for definiteness the reference temperature of 100 k , which corresponds to the largest ps cloud exiting the converter , and consequently greater laser powers .",
    "this choice ensures a successful ps excitation with lower temperatures as well .      in the first excitation step the doppler linewidth @xmath37 , scaling as @xmath38 , turns out to be around @xmath39 nm , corresponding to the energy broadening @xmath40 ev . a motional stark electric field @xmath41 , where @xmath15 is taken for definiteness along the @xmath42 axis , is induced by the ps motion within the relatively strong magnetic field @xmath43 t @xcite .",
    "this effect splits the sub  levels of the state @xmath31 in energy and leads to some mixing of quantum numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 , due to the breaking of the axial symmetry of moving ps atoms .",
    "the maximum broadening due to this effect is evaluated as @xmath46 nm ( the total energy width of the sub  level structure amount to @xmath47 ev ) @xcite , negligible with respect to the doppler broadening .",
    "therefore we conclude that the width of the transition @xmath48 is dominated by the doppler broadening , and the laser linewidth must be provided accordingly .",
    "since ps excitation is incoherent , the saturation fluence is calculated by a rate equation model ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the excitation probability for unit time is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the power spectrum of the laser pulse and the absorption cross section @xmath51 is @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the vacuum light speed and @xmath54 is the planck constant divided by @xmath55 ) .",
    "the function @xmath56 is the normalized lineshape representing the doppler broadened line , _ i.e. _ a gaussian function centered on the transition frequency @xmath57 and with a fwhm corresponding to the doppler linewidth @xmath58 .",
    "the factor @xmath59 is the absorption einstein coefficient appropriate to the dipole  allowed transition ( the frequency dependence is inserted for consistency with the following subsection ) . in first approximation @xcite",
    "this coefficient coincides with that of the unperturbed transition @xmath60 where @xmath44 can be selected by the laser polarization , specified by the unit vector @xmath61 .",
    "hence one has @xmath62 with the electric dipole matrix element @xmath63 the position operator ) calculated using standard methods from the general theory of radiative transition in atomic physics @xcite and the exact gordon formula @xcite .    by matching the resonant laser linewidth to the doppler broadening ( aiming to maximize ps cloud covering in the spectral domain ) and assuming for definiteness linear laser polarization along the @xmath42 axis , from the results of the rate equation theory developed in appendix ( see eq .",
    "( [ fsat ] ) ) we can determine the saturation fluence for the first transition as @xmath64 this equation gives the lowest pulse fluence needed for reaching transition saturation .",
    "the energy of the exciting laser pulse will depend on the laser spot - size ( which must overlap the ps cloud ) .",
    "assuming a transverse cloud fwhm dimension of @xmath65 mm ( the ps cloud section of 6 mm@xmath66 of aegis proposal ) and fixing the fluence value @xmath67 at the maximum of the transverse gaussian laser profile as @xmath68 , the laser pulse energy ( @xmath69 ) comes out to be @xmath70j .",
    "the physics of the second transition @xmath71 high@xmath0 is significantly different .",
    "the doppler broadening is practically independent of @xmath0 and turns out to be around 0.35 nm at 100 k ( corresponding to an energy broadening of @xmath72 ev ) , whereas the stark motional effect turns out to be many times higher , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ stark - graph ] .     for the transition @xmath73 .",
    "the dashed line ( b ) shows the energy distance ( in nm ) between adjacent unperturbed @xmath0 states .",
    "the dotted vertical line is the ionization limit for the lowest sub level .",
    "the useful range for ps rydberg excitation is indicated.,width=302 ]    the effect due to the motional stark electric field becomes the dominant characteristic of the transition . because of it , the degenerate high@xmath0 levels become fans or manifolds of their @xmath74 sub  levels with a complete mixing of their @xmath44 and @xmath45 sub states , while the mixing between @xmath0levels in positronium atoms does not occur to a good extent @xcite .",
    "owing to the @xmath44 and @xmath45 sub  level mixing , these unperturbed quantum numbers are no longer good quantum numbers labelling the states , at variance with the principal quantum number @xmath0 which retains its role @xcite .",
    "the energy width @xmath75 of a fan can be evaluated from the usual theory of the stark effect , and increases both with the magnetic field and @xmath0 as @xmath76 where @xmath12 is the bohr radius , @xmath77 is the positronium atom thermal transverse velocity ( @xmath44 being the positronium mass ) and a factor of @xmath78 comes from the fact that the radius of the ground state of a ps atom is equal to @xmath79 .",
    "the broadening @xmath80 of the transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ stark - graph ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the splitting between adjacent unperturbed energy levels ( which energy is @xmath81 ) decreases with @xmath0 @xmath82 as shown in the figure .",
    "therefore for @xmath83 the bandwidth filled by the sublevels relative to an @xmath0 state becomes overwhelmingly greater than the interval between two adjacent @xmath0levels .",
    "thus , at @xmath0 larger than 16 an interleaving of many sublevels is expected .",
    "the range of @xmath0 levels useful for the charge transfer reaction and efficient @xmath3 formation starts from @xmath84 , i.e. in the region of notable level mixing .",
    "we would like to remark that our calculations refer to the cases where @xmath85 ( as it comes out from fig .",
    "[ stark - graph ] ) .",
    "another effect of the motional stark electric field that has to be considered is the possible atom ionization : the transition from the bound state to an ionized state occurs from the bottom sub ",

    "@xcite ) to the unbound states .",
    "this action determines an upper @xmath0level useful for our purpose .",
    "the minimum stark electric field @xmath86 which induces high ionization probability at the lowest energy @xmath87 of the level fan is calculated as @xcite @xmath88 hence , for @xmath34 t and for the reference temperature of 100  k , the ionization starts affecting part of the level fan for @xmath89",
    ". this ionization limit , and the useful range for @xmath0 , are indicated in fig .",
    "[ stark - graph ] .",
    "let us consider the distribution of the sublevels to calculate the @xmath90 high@xmath0 transition probability .",
    "for a given @xmath0 , a uniform distribution of the @xmath74 fan sublevels within the motional stark energy width @xmath75 may be assumed .",
    "the number of originally unperturbed @xmath0levels interleaved with that reference @xmath0level within its fan width is approximately ( see also fig .",
    "[ figlivelli ] ) @xmath91 therefore the sub level density per unit angular frequency results in @xmath92 independent of the induced stark field and consequently on the positron velocity .",
    "we stress that this density occurs with a motional stark effect high enough ( that is a transverse positronium velocity in a high magnetic field ) for producing an interleaving of many @xmath0-level fans , and it increases very fast with @xmath0 . within the uninteresting region of the transitions",
    "to @xmath93 it is easy to see that the density of sublevels is a constant on @xmath0 .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath94 of the second transition laser has to be wider than the doppler bandwidth @xmath37 ( for ps cloud efficient covering ) , and also narrower than @xmath95 for constraining ps atom excitation within a reasonable narrow energy band ( seeming this suitable for an efficient charge transfer reaction ) .",
    "therefore the laser energy bandwidth @xmath96 is selected to be smaller than @xmath75 so that the sublevel density of the above equation holds . in these conditions ,",
    "all the mixed sublevels with transition energy under the laser bandwidth can be populated , at variance with those foreseen by the electric dipole selection rule @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figlivelli ] a schematic picture of the level mixing is shown .",
    "the number of levels per unit bandwidth remains , in a crude approximation , unchanged with the increase of the fan aperture because the sublevels lost at the border of the initially chosen laser bandwidth @xmath96 are compensated by the arrival of sublevels coming form the nearby @xmath0-states .",

    "( [ density ] ) could be straightforwardly written down with the crude argument that a rydberg level contains @xmath74 sublevels and the interdistance between @xmath0 levels is @xmath98 .",
    "anyway , this consideration does not account for the strong sublevel opening and mixing . within that framework , the above statement on the independence on @xmath0 of the absorption probability @xmath116",
    "requires a sufficiently wide laser bandwidth ( covering several unperturbed @xmath0 levels ) , whereas our calculations indicate that this condition is not required .",
    "the strong energy sub - level mixing leads to a physical system with a wide energy bandwidth with uniform energy level distribution . as a consequence",
    ", the doppler effect simply leads to a shift of the resonant frequency for a particular transition within the bandwidth .",

    "( [ density ] ) and ( [ bb ] ) , and following the procedure and the definitions outlined in the appendix , the absorption probability rate turns out to be : @xmath117 finally , by considering for definiteness linear laser polarization parallel to the magnetic field direction ( hence operating with the selection rule @xmath118 ) , we obtain the saturation fluence for the second transition : @xmath119 which in fact results approximately a constant in the useful range between @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we can evaluate the total energy of the laser pulse needed for saturation of this rydberg excitation with the same method used in the previous subsection , and the result is @xmath122j .      in the above sections we have found the minimum laser energy requirements to obtain saturation on the two transitions .",
    "however , the real rydberg excitation is performed with near simultaneous laser pulses .",
    "this is so because of the narrow useful time window , to cope with a rather large expanding ps cloud , and the need of avoiding losses on @xmath31 excited population due to its non negligible spontaneous emission . in this conditions",
    "the excitation dynamics involves all the three levels of the two  step transition .",
    "if the laser pulse energies are greater than the saturation fluences , an overall level population of 33% is expected for this incoherent excitation @xcite , in the limit case of no losses .",
    "this can be confirmed with a dynamical model as follows .    in the previously discussed picture of the problem",
    "there is a lack of information on the exact quantum numbers for the final states of the transition .",
    "therefore we decided to use a simplified excitation dynamics model to obtain an estimate of the high-@xmath0 state population .",
    "we made dynamical simulations considering transitions from @xmath123 to the state @xmath124 and from this state to the final states @xmath125 and @xmath126 , assuming linear laser polarization as discussed before . in simulations",

    "in fact , the motional stark effect splits and totally mixes the otherwise degenerate sublevels of rydberg states leading to systems with wide energy bandwidth with a uniform energy level distribution .",
    "therefore , stark effect totally overcomes the doppler effect in determining the bandwidth of the transition .",
    "it is important to note that both effects , doppler and stark , depend on the square root of the temperature , hence one expects transition characteristics not to change if the ps cloud can be extracted from the silica converter with lower average kinetic energy .",

    "this theoretical result certainly needs an experimental evidence .",
    "another important consequence of the stark effect is that the range of high-@xmath0 levels on which one can obtain high excitation efficiency is limited ( for example at @xmath140 for @xmath141 k ) because ps atoms populating part of the @xmath0-sublevels are easily ionized by the induced electric field .",
    "calculations performed in this paper foresee a 30 % transition efficiency with a tailored laser system ( with @xmath0 below the limit for stark ionization as discussed before ) . in particular , the degree of freedom of the interaction bandwidth with the rydberg level manifold is important to obtain excited ps atoms in a definite range of energies , which may be required for maximum efficiency of the subsequent charge exchange process with antiprotons . it must be further researched how ps atoms populating different n  levels , even if with nearby energy values , affect the efficiency of the charge exchange reaction @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath142 a relatively simple modeling is sufficient , being the bandwidth essentially doppler dependent . for the second step @xmath73 more attention must be devoted because of the strong motional stark mixing affecting the rydberg level structure , resulting in the formula ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "finally , we stress that the discussed ps excitation scheme makes a complete incoherent population transfer , because of the very short coherence length of the two lasers required for the excitation .",
    "this is reflected in the maximum excitation efficiency , that can not be more than 33% @xcite .",
    "a possible extension of this work towards higher excitation efficiency is the use of coherent population transfer techniques such as stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) @xcite , which appears nevertheless challenging because of the complex structure of the rydberg levels .",

    "<S> antihydrogen production by charge exchange reaction between positronium ( ps ) atoms and antiprotons requires an efficient excitation of ps atoms up to high-@xmath0 levels ( rydberg levels ) . in this study </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that a ps cloud is produced within a relatively strong uniform magnetic field ( 1 tesla ) and with a relatively high temperature ( 100 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the structure of energy levels are deeply modified by zeeman and motional stark effects . </S>",
    "<S> a two  step laser light excitation , the first one from ground to @xmath1 and the second from this level to a rydberg level , is proposed and the physics of the problem is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a simple formula giving the absorption probability with substantially incoherent laser pulses . a 30% population deposition in high-@xmath0 states </S>",
    "<S> can be reached with feasible lasers suitably tailored in power and spectral bandwidth . </S>"
