    "since the observation of the quantum phase transition from the superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi ) , ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice have provided unique fields for studies of strongly correlated quantum matter  @xcite . in particular , the experimental creation of mixtures of two types of bosons in optical lattices  @xcite has opened up new possibilities to explore exotic quantum phases .",
    "previous studies have analyzed the two - species bose - hubbard model , which quantitatively describes systems of bose - bose mixtures in optical lattices , and predicted various quantum phases , including sf , mi , phase separation , paired superfluid ( psf ) , counterflow superfluid ( cfsf ) , density wave , and supersolid phases  @xcite .",
    "the psf phase is a superfluid of composite particles that consist of two bosons of different types , and is present for attractive inter - component interaction  @xcite .",
    "the cfsf is expected to emerge inside the mott insulator for repulsive inter - component interaction , and is interpreted as a superfluid of composite particles consisting of a boson of one type and a hole of the other  @xcite . in the psf ( cfsf )",
    "phase , only the in - phase ( out - of - phase ) motional degrees of freedom exhibits superfluidity , i.e. the motion is dissipationless , while the out - of - phase ( in - phase ) motion is prohibited . despite the intensive interest ,",
    "these two exotic phases have not been experimentally observed so far .",
    "hu _ et al .",
    "_  have reported the dipole oscillations in the sf , psf , and cfsf phases in an one - dimensional optical lattice using the time - evolving block decimation method  @xcite . in order to understand such a dynamical behavior , it is important to reveal the details of the excitations of bose - bose mixtures in an optical lattice .",
    "the excitations of a one - component bose - hubbard model  @xcite have been well understood from previous theoretical and experimental studies . in the mi phase ,",
    "the lowest two branches of the excitation spectrum are gapful and correspond to the particle- and hole - excitation modes  @xcite . in the sf phase , the excitation spectrum has one gapless mode and gapful modes  @xcite .",
    "the gapless mode corresponds to oscillations of the phase of the superfluid order parameter and is known as the bogoliubov mode while the lowest gapful mode is regarded as the amplitude mode in the vicinity of the sf - to - mi transition at commensurate fillings .",
    "it is also well - known that the amplitude mode becomes gapless at the critical point .",
    "the excitation spectra have been experimentally detected via the bragg spectroscopy  @xcite and the lattice - amplitude modulation  @xcite and been successfully used to characterize the two phases and the phase transitions .",
    "likewise , it is expected that elementary excitations can be used to distinguish the different phases and the sf - to - mi transitions in bose - bose mixtures .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quantum phase transitions and the excitation properties of bose - bose mixtures at zero temperature in an optical lattice using the gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) .",
    "we assume equal hoppings and equal intra - component interactions for both components . to describe the sf and mi phases ,",
    "we directly apply the ga to the two - component bose - hubbard model",
    ". however , this approach fails to capture the psf and cfsf phases because these phases arise from the hopping of particle pairs or anti - pairs . in order to analyze the phases",
    ", we use the effective hamiltonian describing the degrees of freedom of pairs or anti - pairs within the second order - perturbation theory .",
    "first , we determine the ground - state phase diagrams of this system , for which our main focus is placed on the first - order sf - to - mi transition .",
    "_  have performed monte carlo simulations on so - called two - component @xmath0-current model , which is a classical counterpart of the two - component bose - hubbard model at even total fillings , and found that the sf - to - mi phase transition at even total fillings can be of the first order for a certain region of the inter - component interaction  @xcite .",
    "more recently , chen _ et al . _  have applied a method based on the tensor product states to the two - component bose - hubbard model with attractive inter - component interaction and the hardcore constraint , and shown that the transition from incommensurate sf to mi can be of the first order as well  @xcite . in the present paper , we will show that this is also the case for the two - component softcore bose - hubbard model with repulsive inter - component interaction and that the region of the first - order transition is extended to a wide range of the chemical potential .",
    "second , in order to study the excitations , we extend the method for calculating excitation spectra of the bose - hubbard model @xcite to the system of bose - bose mixtures .",
    "we discuss the effect of inter - component interaction on the excitation spectra in the sf and mi phases .",
    "we show that the gap of the in - phase amplitude mode vanishes at the sf - to - mi transition for odd total filling and another amplitude mode also becomes gapless at the second - order sf - to - mi transition for even total filling .",
    "finally , we investigate the response to density perturbation by applying the linear response theory to the lattice system . in the sf , psf , and cfsf phases , we calculate the dynamical structure factors regarding responses to the three types of density perturbation , namely one - component , in - phase , and out - of - phase fluctuations , in order to show that these phases can be identified by means of the bragg scattering techniques .",
