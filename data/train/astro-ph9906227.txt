    "the linewidth  luminosity relation ( hereafter the tf relation ) has been one of the most successful and widely applied method to determine distances to galaxies up to @xmath0 10,000 km s@xmath1 , or @xmath2 mpc ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "observations with a single dish telescope for the tf relation beyond this redshift have been affected by the source confusion and the signal dilution due to the larger beam size . for farther galaxies beyond the limit the co tf relation using co linewidths",
    "instead of is available ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is advantageous for higher @xmath3 galaxies , because the beam size in co observations is sharper than hi , also there are a lot of samples that have higher co luminosity .",
    "the compatibility of co and linewidths has been examined and shown good agreement for nearby spiral galaxies ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in the case of interacting galaxies",
    "both linewidths are affected by the interaction , the co linewidth is rather stable enough to apply the tf relation for weakly interacting galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions of co and in a galaxy are clearly separated and the boundary is known as the molecular front ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation curves are not completely flat and the shape and amplitude depend on the size of a galaxy or luminosity ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . besides the co and linewidths",
    "are given by the rotation velocity where the gas is distributed .",
    "this means the relation between co and linewidths depends on the size or luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we discuss the co and distributions with a synthetic rotation curve model presented by persic  ( 1996 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the data and sample selection in sect.2 , the comparison between co and linewidths and the analysis based on the rotation curve model given by persic  ( 1996 ) in sect.3 , the discussion about the methods that we used for the analysis in sect.4 and the summary in also the last section .",
    "we have sampled the  linewidth data from some catalogs of nearby galaxies .",
    "although some of these co linewidths are measured by a single beam that is sufficient to cover the extent of co , most are synthesized from mapping along the major axis . for the latter case we have estimated the linewidths from the position  velocity diagram .",
    "this method may diminish the correlation with the linewidths that are observed with the single beam .",
    "this effect is discussed in the last section .",
    "the properties of the co data are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have compiled the linewidths and the inclination using the leda ( lyon - meudon extragalactic database ) . from the original sample",
    "we have excluded ( 1 ) face - on galaxies of @xmath4 and ( 2 ) morphologically interacting galaxies .",
    "the number of the galaxies after these selections is listed in column 2 in table 1 .",
    "the linewidths are defined as the full width at 20% of the maximum intensity and corrected for the inclination : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for co and hi , respectively .",
    "( 85,85)[tl ]    ( 85,85)[tl ]      we have reexamined the co and linewidths relation as dickey & kazes ( 1992 ) and schniger & sofue ( 1992 ) did , with lager samples . the samples that we used here are selected from slow rotating galaxies to fast rotating galaxies listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 1 is the plot of co linewidths against corresponding linewidths whose inclinations are corrected .",
    "we see from fig.1 that the values of both co and hi linewidths are not entirely equivalent , but linewidths are broader than co for slow rotating galaxies ( _ i.e. _ dwarf galaxies ) and co linewidths are broader than for fast rotating galaxies ( _ i.e. _ massive galaxies ) . we have fitted the samples by the least square method , and obtained the relation , that is shown as the solid line in fig.1 : @xmath9    ( 85,37)[h ]    .references of the sample and the properties of the co observations .

    "the estimated absolute magnitude differs in the logarithm of the linewidth , therefore the comparison of both linewidths for the effect of the tf relation should be taken as the ratio .",
    "figure 3 shows the residuals of both linewidths as the notation of @xmath10 in each bin .",
    "this shows that slow rotating galaxies are not proper sample in applying the tf relation , also we should note that the observed rotation velocity in co and provide different values .",
    "( 85,85)[tl ]      figure 4 shows the co data distribution in each bin over the tf ( linewidth  absolute magnitude ) diagram . here",
    "the absolute magnitude is calculated by the @xmath11-band tf relation given by pierce & tully ( 1992 ) :    @xmath12    as we discussed the difference in the co and linewidths in the previous section , the most appropriate tf relation with the co linewidths is shifted from the hi tf relation for the slow rotating galaxies and the fast rotating galaxies .",
    "this effect also appears in fig .",
    "the tf relation connected by the co data points is different from the tf relation .",
    "the connected co tf relation except the slowest rotation portion shows a linear relation like the tf relation . while it provides the different values of the slope and offset from the tf relation , the output absolute magnitudes from both tf relations are not much varied for the intermediately rotating galaxies .",
    "it suggests that the compatibility of the co and hi linewidths is realized for the intermediately rotating galaxies , whereas the fast and slow rotating galaxies have different values .",
    "( 85,85)[tl ]    in order to discuss the difference between two tf relations , we used the synthetic rotation curve model , that is based on the statistics of rotation curves , proposed by persic  ( 1996 ) ( hereafter the pss model ) .",
    "the pss model provides that the rotation velocity is the function of not only the radius but also the luminosity .",
    "three variables of the pss model are ( 1 ) rotation velocity , @xmath13 , ( 2 ) absolute magnitude in the _",
    "i_-band , @xmath14 and ( 3 ) the galacto - centric radius normalized by the optical disk radius , @xmath15 .",
    "they make a surface in a three - dimensional space ( _ i.e. _ @xmath16 ) . here",
    ", @xmath17 corresponds to the de vaucouleurs 25 @xmath18 mag arcsec@xmath19 photometric radius for the freeman disk , or corresponds to 3.2 @xmath20 for the exponential surface brightness distribution , where @xmath20 is the disk scale length .",
    "this surface is useful to discuss the rotation curves and the tf relation , because they are obtained by the projection of the surface .",
    "if the surface is projected onto the @xmath13 vs. @xmath15 plane , it shows synthetic rotation curves with the parameter of the absolute magnitude @xmath14 ( see dotted lines in fig .",
    "5 . ) which are called the universal rotation curves by pss96 . on the other hand",
    ", if the surface is projected onto the @xmath13 vs. @xmath14 plane , it shows a kind of the tf relations ( linewidth  luminosity relation ) with the parameter of the specific radius @xmath15 .",
    "( see dotted line in fig .",
    "the values of the specific radius shown as the dotted lines of @xmath21 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.7(thick dotted line ) , 1.0 , 1.5(dotted broken line ) , 2.0 and 2.5 , top to bottom .",
    "here we have defined the linewidths as the double of the rotation velocity used in the pss model .",
    "( 85,85)[tl ]    in fig.4 the comparison between the pss model and the tf relation shows the following : ( 1 ) the tf relation does not fit the pss model at the slow rotation part ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this is consistent with what the tf relation is not a good tracer for slow rotating galaxies suggested by giovanelli  ( 1997 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the tf relation fits the pss model of around @xmath23 well .",
    "this is consistent with the distribution in a galaxy , where it is extended over the optical radius .",
    "( 3 ) on the other hand , the co data points trace the inner radius of the pss model than the optical radius through the whole linewidth .",
    "this is also consistent the co distribution in a galaxy .",
    "the results that we discussed in the previous section can be explained by what the distributions of co and are different and what the rotation curves depend on the luminosity .",
    "figure 5 indicates the specific isoradius curves of @xmath24 over the synthetic rotation curves by the pss model .",
    "rotation curves observed by the optical spectroscopy are within the radius of @xmath25 .",
    "we have found that the specific radius for the co data is about @xmath26 , where the rotation curves trace the maximum velocity part of the disk component , whereas for the linewidths it is about @xmath23 and it traces the outer rather flatter part of the rotation curves .",
    "we should pay attention to the difference between them , when we discuss the rotation velocity or the tf relation in co and in hi .",
    "the pss model is constructed by the statistics of rotation curves and by fitting of two mass components , a disk and a halo .",
    "we should note that the pss model does not follow the real rotation curves in the central region .",
    "sofue  ( 1999 ) has discussed the central rotation curves , and found that the most rotation curves except dwarf galaxies are almost flat toward the center or show a nucleus high velocity part for some of fast rotating galaxies .",
    "although the bulge and nucleus components are not considered in the pss model , the influence of these components on the rotation curves is still small for this analysis at @xmath27 .",
    "most of the co linewidths which we used in this analysis are estimated by the position ",
    "velocity diagrams which are observed along the major axis , although the sample of lavezzi & dickey ( 1998 ) have larger @xmath3 and the single beam can cover the co extent . on the contrary ,",
    "the linewidths are measured by the single beam .",
    "it may occur the bias for the relation between the co and linewidths .",
    "mapping along the major axis may not cover the real linewidth .",
    "however , the single co beam only at the center of a galaxy can not cover the co extent for nearby galaxies .",
    "anyway the major axis mapping is necessary for the discussion . to avoid the bias due to the major axis mapping we have excluded the face - on galaxies .    in summary",
    ", we have found the trend between the co and linewidths by compiling the co and datasets .",
    "linewidths are larger than co for slow rotating galaxies , and co linewidths are larger than for fast rotating galaxies .",
    "this trend is common through the all datasets , although the slow rotating portion has a large dispersion .",
    "the linewidths for slow rotating galaxies of @xmath28 are not appropriate in applying the tf relation .",
    "although the trend gives the different slope and offset values of the tf relation from those of , the output absolute magnitude of intermediately rotating galaxies of 300 @xmath29 is approximately equivalent with that provided by the tf relation .    in order to explain the trend we have examined the synthetic rotation curve model proposed by persic  ( 1996 ) .",
    "then the trend can be explained by both the different distributions of the co and in a galaxy and the entirely non - flatness of the rotation curves . combining the tf relation with the synthetic rotation curves of the pss model",
    "provides that the radius within the optical radius where co is distributed is reflected in the co linewidths , and the radius beyond the optical radius where is distributed is also reflected in the linewidths .",
    "it is worth noting that the distribution of co , or something else to be used in measuring the linewidths actually influences the linewidths , therefore the exact linewidths should be corrected for the effects of the rotation curves and the gas distribution .",
