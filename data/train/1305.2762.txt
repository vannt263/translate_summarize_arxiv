    "due to width bifurcation , the width of one of the states may approach zero .    in both cases ,",
    "the dpt occurs in a finite parameter range where @xmath204 for the phase rigidity of the participating states @xmath7 .",
    "the basic process is width bifurcation ( caused by the existence of eps and the related nonlinear terms in the equations ) by means of which states with very different lifetime are created .",
    "fermi s golden rule holds only below the dpt whereas beyond the dpt we have an anti - golden rule . in both cases ,",
    "the neighborhood of the eps is non - symmetric in relation to energy and ( or ) time ( sect .",
    "[ disc1 ] ) .",
    "the dpt may explain many results observed experimentally which are counterintuitive at first glance , e.g. @xcite in a many - level system and @xcite in a two - level system . according to the results of the present paper , some features of dicke s superradiance",
    "may be related also to a dpt .    due to the relation of a dpt to irreversible processes , it is interesting to prove experimentally the influence of a nearby state onto the symmetry properties of an ep .",
    "our results suggest that the symmetry is influenced by the existence of another state in the neighborhood of the ep where @xmath206 holds for the phase rigidity . under this condition ,",
    "the phases of the eigenfunctions @xmath17 relative to one another are not fixed and irreversible processes may appear .    while dpts are known to appear in open quantum systems and related ( qualitatively ) to singular points ( eps ) since several years ( references can be found in sect .",
    "6 of @xcite and in sect . 5 of @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite ) , some properties of dicke s superradiance are referred to singular points first in the present paper .",
    "the results should be proven by further experimental studies .",
    "furthermore , the results are surely important for fundamental questions of quantum mechanics . above all",
    "however , they are of high value for applications where long - lived states play an important role , e.g. for the storage of information , for quantum memory and for quantum filter . as shown in the present paper , fermi s golden rule is replaced by an anti - golden rule under certain conditions . here , states with a long lifetime may occur due to width bifurcation in a two - level system at a coupling strength @xmath115 that is large and causes coherent emission , but is too small in order to destroy the whole system .",
    "in such a case , the wavefunction of the long - lived ( subradiant ) state is well defined .",
    "the notation _ dynamical phase transition ( dpt ) _ is used in literature in order to describe the redistribution of the spectroscopic properties of an open quantum system under critical conditions when the system s properties are controlled by a parameter , see e.g. the review @xcite .",
    "the redistribution is mostly counterintuitive and is related to a violation of fermi s golden rule .",
    "two examples are the following .",
    "( i ) a dpt is observed experimentally and explained theoretically in the spin swapping operation @xcite .",
    "while fermi s golden rule holds below the dpt , it is violated above it .",
    "( ii ) the experimentally observed so - called phase lapses in quantum dots @xcite can be explained by means of a dpt occurring due to the non - hermiticity of the hamilton operator @xcite and is related to width bifurcation caused by exceptional points ( eps ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of an open quantum system is non - hermitian due to its coupling to the environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath229 ( with @xmath207 ) of the non - hermitian hamiltonian are complex and provide not only the energies of the states but also their lifetimes ( inverse proportional to the widths @xmath34 ) . at several points",
    ", two eigenvalues may coalesce .",
    "these points are singular and called mostly _ exceptional points ( ep ) _ ( after kato @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , dpts are related to eps around which the phase rigidity ( [ eif11 ] ) is reduced .",
    "it is possible therefore that one of the states of the open system aligns to the scattering states of the environment and becomes short - lived while the other states decouple from the environment and become long - lived .",
    "physically , dpts are the result of selforganization @xcite and occur under the influence of the environment in which the system is embedded .",
    "most important is the formation of different time scales in the open quantum system at parameter values beyond the critical ones , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a non - trivial question is whether the dpts with properties sketched above have something in common with a phase transition in the sense of thermodynamics .",
    "this question is studied some years ago @xcite . under critical conditions ,",
    "a reorganization of the spectrum takes place that creates a bifurcation of the time scales with respect to the lifetimes of the resonance states .",
    "the conditions under which the reorganization process can be understood as a second - order phase transition are derived analytically and the results are illustrated by numerical investigations .",
    "the conditions are fulfilled , e.g. , for a uniform picket - fence distribution with equal coupling of the states to the continuum .",
    "other examples are also considered . in all cases ,",
    "the reorganization of the spectrum occurs at the critical value of the control parameter _ globally _ over the whole energy range of the spectrum .",
    "all states act _ cooperatively_. the length scale diverges as well as the degree of non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian ( which is related to the phase rigidity defined in ( [ eif11 ] ) ) .",
    "both values diverge at the ep even in the two - level case if the coupling to the continuum is sufficiently strong ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig3].c , [ fig7].e and [ fig8].e ) .",
    "the time scale of an open quantum system @xcite differs however from that of a closed system the hamiltonian of which is hermitian .",
    "further , observables such as the cross section behave smoothly at the critical value of the control parameter due to the bi - orthogonality of the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian operator involved in the s - matrix ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the numerical results shown in sect .",
    "[ num3 ] ) .",
    "phase transitions in open quantum systems which are associated with the formation of long - lived and short - lived states according to @xcite , are related to eps first in @xcite .",
    "more recent results can be found in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most important difference between hermitian and non - hermitian quantum mechanics is surely the fact that the phases of the eigenstates ( relative to one another ) of a non - hermitian operator are not rigid in the neighborhood of an ep ( see ( [ eif11 ] ) and the corresponding discussion ) , while they are rigid everywhere in the standard hermitian quantum physics .",
    "it should be mentioned here , that a dpt can not be described by using a master equation .",
    "the reason is the basic assumption for the description of the dynamics of a quantum system by a master equation , according to which the time scale @xmath230 has to satisfy the condition @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the characteristic timescale of the system .",
    "this condition is not fulfilled near to an ep since this point is a crossing point of two eigenvalue trajectories .",
    "near to an ep , the characteristic time scale @xmath232 approaches therefore zero ( see also ( [ eif5 ] ) for the two wavefunctions at the ep ) . this fact does surely not play any role for an isolated ep in a many - level system .",
    "it does however not allow to describe the many - level system by a master equation in the regime of many dense lying eps , i.e. when a dpt is approached .",
    "another question is the relation of dpts as defined above , to dissipative phase transitions studied in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "dissipative phase transitions occur in open quantum systems when the asymptotic decay rate ( defined by the smallest linewidth after the width bifurcation ) vanishes . according to the above discussion",
    ", this case is a special dpt occurring when ( at least ) one of the long - lived states decouples completely from the environment and a non - analytical steady state appears at the critical ( exceptional ) point .",
    "an example is considered numerically in sect .",
    "[ num3 ] and is discussed in sect .",
    "[ disc2 ] .",
    "the numerical results obtained for dissipative phase transitions @xcite show the same characteristic features as those received in the present model , figs .",
    "[ fig1].a , b and , above all , figs .",
    "[ fig3].a , b .",
    "the numerical results obtained for dpts prove the analytical results ( [ int6b ] ) to ( [ int6d ] ) and are very robust .",
    "furthermore , the results of both approaches are related to selforganization by the authors , respectively @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it should be added here that dpts in the sense of the definition given above are found and discussed in different real systems theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "two examples are mentioned above , @xcite and @xcite . in the first case",
    ", the dpt causes a violation of fermi s golden rule . in the second case",
    ", experimental results which could not be explained in the framework of standard hermitian theory in spite of much effort , could be interpreted by means of a dpt occurring due to the non - hermiticity of the hamilton operator in the open quantum system .",
    "further examples are , among others , the correlated behavior of conductance and phase rigidity in the transition from the weak - coupling to the strong - coupling regime in quantum dots @xcite and laser - induced resonance trapping in atoms @xcite .",
    "some years ago , a direct experimental proof of a dpt is performed in an open microwave cavity @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "generic results on dpts occurring in open quantum systems are studied and compared with the experience obtained from the study of real physical systems .",
    "to this end , a toy model is used .",
    "an open quantum system is embedded into an environment .",
    "the natural environment is the continuum of scattering wavefunctions that always exists .",
    "it can be modified , however not deleted .",
    "the hamilton operator @xmath3 of the system is non - hermitian .",
    "its eigenvalues contain the information on the interaction of states via the environment , i.e. the feedback between system and environment .",
    "the feshbach projection operator technique @xcite containing the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath3 , provides a convenient method to describe an open many - body quantum system . using this method , first the _ energy - independent _ many - body problem of the system ( with the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath106 )",
    "is solved in the standard manner .",
    "these solutions provide the energies @xmath233 and wavefunctions @xmath234 of the discrete states ( eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath106 ) with inclusion of the so - called _ internal _ interaction . in a second step ,",
    "the _ energy - dependent _ scattering wavefunctions @xmath235 of the environment are calculated and , further , the ( energy - dependent ) coupling matrix elements @xmath236 between the discrete states of the system and the environment are evaluated ( see @xcite , sect .",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath3 contains the selfenergy of the states in the diagonal matrix elements and the interaction of the different states via the environment ( the so - called _ external _ interaction ) in the nondiagonal matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 reads @xmath237 where @xmath238 and @xmath239 stand for the coupling between system and environment and @xmath240 is the green function in the subspace of scattering states .",
    "the non - hermitian operator @xmath5 can be diagonalized : the eigenvalues @xmath4 are complex and the eigenfunctions @xmath17 are complex and biorthogonal .    the external interaction of the states via the continuum is complex , generally .",
    "the principal value integral is @xmath241 and the residuum reads @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the number of continua .",
    "it is @xmath244 when the different states are coupled to one common continuum ( notation @xmath245 usually by ignoring the index @xmath246 ) .",
    "the interaction of the states of the system with and via the environment is involved in the eigenvalues @xmath16 and eigenfunctions @xmath17 of the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore relatively easy , in this formalism , to study the influence of the environment onto the states of the system .",
    "according to ( [ form5 ] ) , the matrix elements of @xmath5 consist _ formally _ of a first - order and a second - order interaction term .",
    "the first - order term stands for the direct ( _ internal _ ) interaction @xmath22 between the two states @xmath7 and @xmath8 which is involved in @xmath106 .",
    "the states with inclusion of the internal interaction are called usually dressed states .",
    "the second - order term describes the ( _ external _ ) interaction @xmath247 via the continuum @xmath246 ( where @xmath248 is the green function in the continuum of scattering states ) .",
    "the second - order term consists of the principal value integral ( [ form11 ] ) and the residuum([form12 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore complex , generally .",
    "although it is of second order , it determines , under certain conditions , the dynamics of the system .",
    "furthermore , @xmath100 contains the interaction of the state @xmath7 with the environment , i.e. the _ self - energy _ of the state which is analog to the lamb shift known in atomic physics .    in order to study the interaction of two states via the common environment",
    "it is convenient to start from resonance states coupled to the continuum , instead from discrete states .",
    "we use the matrix representation of @xmath5 and consider , as examples , the symmetric @xmath20 matrix ( [ int3 ] ) for 2 states and the @xmath249 matrix ( [ form1 ] ) for @xmath96 states .",
