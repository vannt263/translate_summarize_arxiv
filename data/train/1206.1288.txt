    "the classical crewther relation ( cr ) @xcite connects in a non - trivial way two seemingly unrelated quantities , namely the adler function @xcite and perturbative corrections arising in the sum rules relevant for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "originally the cr had been formulated for the case of a conformal - invariant limit of a field theory .",
    "subsequently , observing a close relation between the @xmath2 terms in the adler function and the corrections to the bjorken sum rule for polarized electron - nucleon scattering , its generalization for the case of qcd was suggested in @xcite , introducing as modification additional terms proportional to the @xmath3-function .",
    "more formal arguments for the validity of this `` generalized crewther relation '' ( gcr ) were given in @xcite . during the past years",
    "the perturbative corrections both for adler function and bjorken sum rule were extended from @xmath2 @xcite to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , these results were restricted to the respective non - singlet parts . nevertheless , they could be used to demonstrate the validity of the gcr between non - singlet adler function and bjorken sum rule @xcite , thus providing at the same time an important cross check of the underlying , demanding calculations .",
    "the @xmath0 singlet piece of the sum rule was published in @xcite , thus completing the prediction for the gross - llewellyn smith ( gls ) sum rule @xcite .",
    "below we give the corresponding result for the adler function . on the one hand this leads to a prediction of the familiar @xmath4-ratio measured in electron - positron annihilation , including the ( small ) up to now missing singlet pieces of @xmath0 , on the other hand this result allows to test the gcr also for the singlet case .",
    "note that all results discussed in this paper are assumed to be renormalized within the conventional @xmath5 subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "for the definition of the adler function it is convenient to start with the polarization function of the flavor singlet vector current : @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the corresponding adler function @xmath9 is naturally decomposed into a sum of the non - singlet ( ns ) and singlet ( si ) components ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath10 here @xmath11 stands for the total number of quark flavours ; all quarks are considered as massless .        the adler function @xmath12 corresponding to the electromagnetic vector current @xmath13 ( @xmath14 stands for the electric charge of the quark field @xmath15 ) is thus given by the following combination : @xmath16 similar decompositions hold for the corresponding polarization functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the physical observable @xmath19 is related to @xmath20 by the optical theorem @xmath21 the result for the perturbative expansions of the non - singlet part ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 has been presented in @xcite . for the singlet",
    "part it reads : @xmath24 where the parameter @xmath25 ( the dimension of the quark color representation , @xmath26 in qcd ) is factorized in _ both _ non - singlet and singlet components .",
    "the singlet component has the following structure at orders @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the quadratic casimir operators of the fundamental and the adjoint representation of the lie algebra , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the trace normalization of the fundamental representation . for qcd ( colour gauge group su(3 ) ) : @xmath34    using the methods described in @xcite we obtain @xmath35    with the use of eqs .",
