    "we recently presented a detailed analysis of the amplitude equation for an unstable electrostatic mode in an unmagnetized vlasov plasma ( henceforth ( i)).@xcite in that work , the amplitude equation was studied using an expansion in the wave amplitude , and only the electron motion was considered with the ions treated as a fixed neutralizing background . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of including mobile ions and investigate the mode amplitude equation for an electrostatic wave in a multi - species unmagnetized plasma . as in ( i ) , we focus on the regime of weak instability and carefully analyze the structure of the amplitude equation in the the limit @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the linear growth rate for the unstable wave .    incorporating the effects of finite ion inertia",
    "is a significant step for several reasons . with finite mass ,",
    "the ion motion occurs on a finite timescale @xmath6 and in the limit of very weak growth rates this will be a fast timescale , i.e. @xmath7 as @xmath1 . over the duration of the instability , the ions can readily respond to the electric field of the wave especially resonant ions near the phase velocity .",
    "this ion response is always present even for high frequency modes such as plasma waves since at the phase velocity the wave frequency is doppler - shifted to zero . in addition , there are modes such as ion - acoustic waves that depend on ion density oscillations and are suppressed when the ions are treated as fixed .",
    "allowing for mobile ions is a prerequisite , if we seek the amplitude equation for an unstable ion - acoustic mode .",
    "this paper can be read independently , but the reader is referred to ( i ) for a discussion of the history of the problem and additional introductory material . an essential difference between our approach and previous work lies in the choice of unperturbed state .",
    "earlier theories assumed an equilibrium with a neutrally stable mode and obtained ill - defined expansion coefficients .",
    "@xcite-@xcite this can be avoided by taking the weakly unstable equilibrium as the unperturbed state ; a choice that naturally leads one to work with the unstable manifold . a brief summary of our results on the multi - species case has appeared elsewhere.@xcite    in the limit @xmath1 , the amplitude equation defines a kind of singular perturbation problem whose detailed features reveal asymptotic scaling behavior of the nonlinear wave",
    "this is a key idea behind our approach and it can be formulated more precisely as follows .",
    "the mode eigenvalue @xmath8 can be complex ( beam - plasma ) or real ( two - stream ) , but in either case the equations for the amplitude @xmath9 have the form @xmath10 since the vlasov equilibrium is assumed to be spatially homogeneous , the evolution of @xmath11 decouples from the phase @xmath12 .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the coefficients @xmath13 are constant ( ignoring their dependence on @xmath2 ) , then we may view ( [ eq : hopf1 ] ) as a singular perturbation problem with the linear term @xmath14 representing the perturbation .",
    "if @xmath15 , then there is always a neighborhood of the equilibrium @xmath16 where the perturbation dominates the unperturbed system and can completely change the dynamics .    as in other such singular problems ,",
    "a possible strategy is to seek a ( singular ) change of variables which transforms ( [ eq : hopf1 ] ) into a regular perturbation problem .",
    "thus it is natural to define a new amplitude @xmath17 by @xmath18 and rewrite ( [ eq : hopf1 ] ) in terms of @xmath17 @xmath19 if possible , the choice of @xmath20 and @xmath21 should be made so that ( _ i _ ) each term in ( [ eq : aeqnb ] ) is well behaved as @xmath1 and ( _ ii _ ) the effect of @xmath15 is a regular perturbation of the system at @xmath22 .",
    "the latter condition requires @xmath23 ; otherwise the linear term will continue to be a singular perturbation .",
    "the exponent @xmath20 then needs to be chosen ( if possible ) to achieve a balance between the nonlinear terms and the linear term . in the simplest situation , when the coefficients @xmath24 have well - defined _ finite _ limits as @xmath25 , then one has the exponent @xmath26 and this yields @xmath27 the unperturbed system @xmath28 now includes the linear term and near @xmath29 the effect of small @xmath2 is unimportant .",
    "the change of variables ( [ eq : newvar ] ) is singular at @xmath22 as expected , but nevertheless we have determined the overall scaling @xmath26 for nonlinear solutions near the equilibrium in the regime of weak instability .",
    "in addition , since terms in ( [ eq : aeqnb ] ) at fifth order or higher are at least of order @xmath30 , the unperturbed problem truncates to a simple balance between the linear instability and the dominant nonlinear term .    for an unstable electrostatic wave ,",
    "the situation is quite different because the nonlinear coefficients @xmath13 blow up as @xmath25 and the exponent @xmath26 does not yield a well - behaved equation for @xmath17 .",
    "we attack the problem of finding a satisfactory value for @xmath20 in two steps .",
    "first , we determine what choice for @xmath20 will control the singularity of the cubic coefficient @xmath31 in ( [ eq : hopf1 ] ) , and then we investigate whether this choice will also remove the singularities of the higher order nonlinear terms . typically , the cubic coefficient diverges asymptotically like @xmath32 in which case we must choose @xmath33 in order to obtain a finite cubic term in the rescaled amplitude equation ( [ eq : aeqnb ] ) .",
    "our analysis shows that setting @xmath34 yields a theory that is finite to all orders as @xmath25 at @xmath22 retains ( rescaled ) nonlinear terms that balance the linear instability .",
    "choosing a larger exponent @xmath35 would also yield a finite theory to all orders , but now the cubic term is of order @xmath36 and all the higher order terms ( @xmath37 ) are of order @xmath38 ; there is no balance between the linear and nonlinear terms at @xmath22 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the larger exponent suppresses nonlinear effects too strongly . in this sense ,",
    "the scaling @xmath40 is uniquely determined .",
    "of the two steps , the second is by far the most difficult ; it is relatively straightforward to compute @xmath31 and determine its divergence ( section [ sec : pinch ] ) .",
    "verifying that a given choice of @xmath20 works to all orders requires a detailed study of the recursion relations of the theory and the final theorem is proved by induction ( section [ sec : all orders ] ) .    in special cases , the cubic coefficient is less singular , diverging like @xmath41 instead of @xmath32 .",
    "the limit of infinitely massive ions is the best known example of this situation , and in ( i ) we found that @xmath42 was the scaling needed to make the nonlinear amplitude equation finite to all orders . in this paper , we identify two additional examples where the cubic coefficient has a @xmath41 singularity : if the effects of the resonant ions are negligible ( in a sense we make precise in section [ subsec : special ] ) or if the electron and ion masses are equal , i.e. for an electron - positron plasma . in the former case",
    "we prove that the exponent @xmath42 is correct , but the precise value of @xmath20 for the electron - positron system is not unambiguously determined due special complications in the singularity structure of the amplitude expansion .",
    "our model is a one - dimensional , multi - species vlasov plasma defined by @xmath43 @xmath44 here @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are measured in units of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , where @xmath50 is a chosen velocity scale and @xmath51 .",
    "the plasma length is @xmath52 with periodic boundary conditions and we adopt the normalization @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the charge of species @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "note that @xmath57 for electrons and that the normalization ( [ eq : fnorm ] ) for negative species makes the distribution function negative .",

    "the notation @xmath70 or @xmath71 denotes matrix multiplication .",
    "an equilibrium @xmath58 depends on parameters such as the densities or temperatures of the various species , but this dependence will be suppressed unless it is explicitly needed .",
    "symmetries of the model ( [ eq : dynsys ] ) and the equilibrium @xmath58 are important qualitative features of the problem , and play a significant role in section [ sec : expand ] when we formulate the amplitude expansions . spatial translation , @xmath72 and reflection , @xmath73 act as operators on @xmath59 in the usual way : if @xmath74 denotes an arbitrary transformation then @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the transformed distribution function .",
    "the operators @xmath77 and @xmath65 commute with @xmath78 due to the spatial homogeneity of @xmath79 , and if @xmath80 , then @xmath77 and @xmath65 also commute with the reflection operator @xmath81 . with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath45 is a periodic coordinate so @xmath78 and @xmath81 generate @xmath82 , the symmetry group of the circle .",
    "if only the translation symmetry is present , then the group is @xmath83 .",

    "when @xmath58 lacks reflection symmetry , then @xmath116 typically has a non - zero phase velocity and @xmath117 is complex . in this case , the identities @xmath118 and @xmath119 imply three additional modes : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 where @xmath123 these eigenfunctions correspond to eigenvalues @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , respectively , and fill out the eigenvalue quartet characteristic of hamiltonian systems . in the absence of reflection symmetry ,",

    "now the emerging singularity in velocity space is weighted by a factor of @xmath599 , and one would like to understand whether the resulting product is finite or singular at @xmath22 . a detailed analysis of this problem will be presented in a forthcoming paper , but the primary conclusion can be simply summarized.@xcite inside a neighborhood of width @xmath30 , and centered on @xmath600 , the singularities in the coefficients of @xmath151 are balanced by the factors of @xmath2 introduced by the rescaling of @xmath593 and one can obtain finite , non - zero limits for the weighted coefficients . outside this small neighborhood of the phase velocity , the factors of @xmath2 force the weighted coefficients to vanish at @xmath22 .    the connection between coefficient singularities and nonlinear scalings that is studied in this paper is relevant in other settings . as mentioned above ,",
    "a key feature of our instabilities is the emergence of the critical eigenvalues from a neutrally stable continuous spectrum .",
    "it has been appreciated recently that this characteristic is shared by a diverse set of additional examples which include the onset of linear instability in fluid shear flows@xcite-@xcite , instabilities of solitary waves@xcite-@xcite , synchronization of large systems of coupled oscillators,@xcite and bifurcations in `` mean field '' descriptions of the dynamics of bubble clouds in fluids@xcite . in the phase - dynamical models of coupled oscillators , the amplitude equations of the weakly unstable modes have been analyzed in the @xmath1 limit.@xcite in these studies , the coefficients can be singular or non - singular depending on how the oscillators are coupled , but when singularities occur in the limit of small growth they can be absorbed by singular rescalings of the amplitude in a procedure analogous to the method used in this paper .",
    "the specific values of the scaling exponents are different , but yield predictions for the emergence of the nonlinear synchronized state .",
    "it seems likely that the analysis of singular amplitude equations provides a general means to determine scaling exponents for weakly unstable systems .",
    "the exponents in turn provide a quantitative measure of the strong nonlinear interaction between the neutrally stable modes and the weakly unstable modes .",
