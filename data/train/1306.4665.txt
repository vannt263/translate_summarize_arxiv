    "the intermediate polar v405 aur was discovered as an optical counterpart of the rosat soft x - ray source 1rxs j055800.7 + 535358 ( rx j0558.0 + 5353 ) by haberl et al . @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray flux was changing with a period of 272.74s , which was supposed to be a spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "the presence of optical pulsations at a period of @xmath3s was reported by ashoka et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "later allan et al .",
    "@xcite and skillman @xcite made independent announcements that the spin period of the white dwarf is twice that previously suggested ( 545.45s ) .",
    "the double value of the spin period was justified by detection of circular polarization with a period of @xmath4d @xmath5s and semi - amplitude of @xmath6 percent ( shakhovskoj and kolesnikov @xcite ) .",
    "noting very similar photometric maxima ( two during a polarimetric period ) , shakhovskoj et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a nearly - equatorial location of two accretion columns .",
    "evans and hellier @xcite discussed the double - peaked spin pulse .",
    "the shape of the phase curve is wavelength - dependent , with a strong separation between the peaks at soft x - ray range and a `` saw - tooth '' shape at hard x - rays .",
    "this is naturally explained by an inequality of the columns .",
    "piirola et al .",
    "@xcite analysed the maxima timings obtained in 1994 - 2007 and published second - order polynomial fit to the timings : @xmath7 the quadratic term is formally positive ( corresponding to a period _ increase ) .",
    "_ however , this term deviates from zero by @xmath8 so is not statistically significant . in brackets",
    "is a statistical error estimate in units of a last digit .",
    "we obtained photometric ccd observations using different telescopes : 1 m vnt ( filters v and r ) and 28 cm pupava ( unfiltered ) reflectors in vihorlat astronomical observatory , humenn , slovakia , 35 cm bat and 50 cm reflector in baja astronomical observatory , hungary ( v and r filters ) and 20 cm meade lx-200 at the observatory and planetarium in hlohovec , slovakia ( v and r filters ) .",
    "also we used ubvri photometry obtained at the 1.25 m azt-11 and wide - r photometry at the 2.6 m shain telescope at the crimean astrophysical observatory , nauchny , ukraine and unfiltered observations from the arkansas tech university observatory .",

    "thus we had to assign formal accuracy to their data .",
    "e.g. for the data published by skillman @xcite we assigned the value of @xmath10 which was estimated as a standard error of phases from his list . for all other initial epochs published without error estimate we assigned a formal value of @xmath11",
    "the o - c diagram for historical timings compiled by piirola et al .",
    "@xcite , maxima timings published in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and our own ones listed in the table  [ tab2 ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] .",
    "contrary to a classical representation of the `` o - c diagram '' as a dependence of the timings from an ephemeris , i.e. @xmath12 on the cycle number @xmath13 we have used phases instead , i.e. @xmath14 for a correct ephemeris , the phases should be concentrated near the zero value . in our case , the times of maxima estimated by a program correspond to a harmonic with a double frequency , thus it is expected that phases like @xmath15 @xmath16 correspond to the same `` zero '' , and thus one may make corrections for these values . for a complete set of `` our@xmath17published '' data , the phases seem to range from @xmath18 to 0.11 .",
    "contrary to a suggestion of piirola et al .",
    "@xcite , the points for the recent years show a distinct period _ decrease_.    a simplest hypothesis is that the period has underwent change ( approximately in 2007 @xmath19 ) .",
    "we analysed separately photometric data , obtained at vihorlat astronomical observatory in 2010 - 2013 .",
    "as light curves in v and r filters had comparable amplitudes but different stellar magnitudes , so we subtracted the mean value of stellar magnitude from the data in each filter and joined it .",
    "we determined the new value of period and initial epoch that better corresponds all spin maxima timings in our observations .",
    "@xmath20    however , previous studies of intermediate polars argue for smooth period variations rather than period jumps , so we analysed other models for the period variations .",
    "to decrease the error estimate of the initial epoch and the period , we computed the ephemeris for a different integer epoch @xmath21 which is close to a sample mean of the observational values . in our case , @xmath22 a weighted fit to the phases of maxima @xmath23 ( which are related to the traditional values of @xmath24 ) leads to the following quadratic ephemeris : @xmath25    the value of the quadratic term @xmath26 reaches @xmath27 so its deviation from zero is not statistically significant .",
    "it does nt fit our recent observations enough good ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , so we calculated the 3-rd order weighted fit to the phases of maxima and got the following cubic ephemeris    @xmath28    it corresponds to all observations better ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and fits most recent observations showing a distinct negative trend .",
    "also we checked a hypothesis of periodic change of @xmath29 we calculated the periodogram using the approximation combining a 1-st order trigonometric and a 1-st order algebraic polynomials ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the maximum peak at the periodogram corresponds to a period of @xmath30yr .",
    "the corresponding fit is @xmath31    as these periodic variations are statistically significant ( at a level of semi - amplitude of @xmath32 ) , one may suggest a third body orbiting the inner binary system with a period of @xmath33yr , with a distance of the center of masses to the binary of 17.2 @xmath34 1.8 light seconds , or @xmath35 meters ) .",
    "the corresponding mass function@xcite is @xmath36 so a third body may be a low - mass red dwarf .",
    "using the software fdcn @xcite and the observations obtained in kolonica , we determined that statistically optimal number of harmonics is 4 .",
    "the phase 0 corresponds to a maximum preceding the primary ( deeper ) minimum , similarly to definition of other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the best fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for two filters v and r. to analyse variations of the color index in the instrumental system , for each phase we computed v - r and a corresponding error estimate @xmath37 the corresponding phase light curve is shown in fig .",
    "it seems to be slightly asymmetric , with a maximum occurring slightly earlier than zero .",
    "the statistical error of the 4-th order trigonometric polynomial is much larger than for the upper curve , so the asymmetries in the shape are not statistically significant . for separate nights ,",
    "the error estimates are even larger .",
    "so finally we used a second - order trigonometric polynomial .",
    "although the color indexes are nearly the same at phases of minima , the excess of the color index is twice larger at phase @xmath38 than at phase @xmath39 this is an interesting observational fact , which could be used for future modelling .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the curves of brightness and color index will be published elsewhere .",
    "corridor.,title=\"fig:\",width=313 ] +",
    "period variations are frequently observed in intermediate polars and are typically detectable at a time scale of decades .",
    "some objects do not show a statistically significant period change ( e.g.1rxs @xmath40 = rxj 1803 = v1323 her @xcite , some show a period decrease ( e.g. bg cmi @xcite , ex hya @xcite , @xcite ) , some show a period increase , but some show increase _ and _ decrease during a couple decades of observations ( e.g. fo aqr @xcite ) .    from theoretical expectations , the spin periods of the white dwarf should be equal to some equilibrium value , which is equal to the period of  kepler \" rotation of the inner accretion disk at a distance of the magnetospheric radius ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "period variations may be caused by changes of the accretion rate due to modulation of the mass transfer caused by magnetic activity of the red secondary ( @xcite , @xcite ) fluctuations of the orbital separation @xcite , or precession of the magnetic white dwarf ( which will be present either with constant , or variable accretion rate ) @xcite .",
    "for another object fs aur in the same constellation , tovmassian et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) suggested precession of the magnetic white dwarf .    at time scales of decades ,",
    "one may see only a part of the curve of cyclic variations .",
    "thus apparently the `` o - c '' diagram may be not a  wave \" , but a square ( for smaller time intervals ) or cubic parabola ( for larger intervals ) .",
    "an alternate model is a presence of a third body - a star or a massive planet . in this case , the theoretical  o - c \" diagram is a periodic wave (  mono  harmonic \" for circular orbit or ",
    "harmonic \" for elliptic orbit ) , which generally is superimposed onto a trend ( cf .",
    "our analysis using the  mcv \" software @xcite shows that the harmonics are not statistically significant , so , assuming a circular orbit with a period of 6.2 yr , we obtained the value of the mass function of @xmath41 as this is a lower limit of the mass of the third body , we may suggest that this is not a planet , but probably a red dwarf .",
    "contrary to the third - order polynomial , the sinusoidal fit shows a return to zero of phases at the end of the interval of observations .",
    "this difference will increase in future .",
    "thus there may be a check - out , which model is correct , during even a year or two of subsequent observations .",
