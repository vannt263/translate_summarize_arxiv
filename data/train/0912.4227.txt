    "the optics of surfaces plays an important role in the calculation of the lifshitz - casimir formula @xcite .",
    "indeed the lifshitz formula can be obtained from the sum of surface - polariton modes between two metallic slabs @xcite . in metallic and semiconducting surfaces the effect of an externally applied magnetic field @xmath0 leds to the excitation of magnetoplasmon modes .",
    "this external magnetic field changes significantly the behavior of the plasma modes and induces an optical anisotropy that is magnetic field dependent @xcite .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the casimir force significantly .",
    "this reduction on the force has been applied to the problem of pull - in dynamics in micro and nano electrodynamical systems ( mems and nems ) , and as has been shown to increase the detachment length in cantilever mems and nems @xcite .    to illustrate this point , consider the drude model in the presence of the external magnetic field .",
    "the equation of motion for the electrons in the material is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the effective mass of the electron , @xmath3 the charge and @xmath4 is the relaxation time . assuming an harmonic electric field @xmath5 the current @xmath6 can be found and thus the conductivity can be calculated @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath10 is the levi - civita symbol . the dielectric tensor is obtained from @xmath11 clearly if @xmath12 we recover the results for the isotropic case .",
    "for an arbitrary direction of the magnetic filed , the calculation of the dispersion relation of the surface magneto plasmons and of the optical reflectivity is difficult . to simplify the problem , specific directions of the magnetic field have to be chosen @xcite . in the so called _ faraday _ configuration ,",
    "the magnetic field is perpendicular to the slab . in this case , there is mode conversion upon reflection from the slab .",
    "this is , if a te wave is incident , the reflected wave will consists of a te and tm modes , similar for an incident tm mode .",
    "the second configuration , that will be used in this paper , is the _ voigt _",
    "geometry where the magnetic field is parallel to the slabs . in this case",
    "there is no mode conversion upon reflection .",
    "consider a slab parallel to the @xmath13 plane . in the voigt geometry",
    "the external magnetic field points along the @xmath14 axis . in this case , the components of the dielectric tensor are given by @xcite @xmath15 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\epsilon_{yy}&=&\\epsilon_l\\left [ 1-\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2-\\omega_c^2 } \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ \\epsilon_{yz}&=&\\epsilon_l\\left [ \\frac{i\\omega_c\\omega_p^2}{\\omega ( \\omega^2-\\omega_c^2 ) } \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the other components are equal to zero . in these equations @xmath18 is the background dielectric function , @xmath19 the plasma frequency , in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath20 and the plates become isotropic .",
    "for simplicity we have not included the drude damping parameter . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will use the dimensionless variable @xmath21 , that gives the relative importance of the external magnetic field . in figure",
    "( 1 ) we have plotted the dielectric function components as given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) after rotation of the frequency to the complex plane @xmath22 for a value of @xmath23 , showing the strong anisotropy of the system .    .",
    "the dielectric function is evaluated in the rotated frequency axis .",
    ", width=453 ]    in the material slab , the dispersion relation is obtained from the wave equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dielectric tensor and @xmath26 . upon replacement of its components ( eq.(4 ) ) into eq.(5 ) , the nontrivial solution of the resulting equation is obtained if @xmath27 outside the slab we assume there is vacuum and we have the usual dispersion @xmath28 the reflection coefficient can now be calculated taking into account that outside the slab , for a tm polarized wave the field is of the form @xmath29 and within the slab @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) respectively . from the corresponding electric fields and by applying the boundary conditions , the reflection coefficients can be found . the detailed procedure for the voigt configuration",
    "can be found in ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "to study the effect of the external magnetic field on the casimir force we use lifhitz formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the matsubara frequencies and @xmath35 the reflectivities for @xmath36 or @xmath37 polarized modes ( tm and te , respectively ) .",
    "this expression for the casimir force can be used only for the voigt configuration since there is no mode conversion .",
    "the faraday configuration , that will be presented elsewhere , requires a more general expression for the casimir force , as the one discussed by bruno @xcite .",
    "the reflectivities @xmath38 and @xmath39 are replaced in eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) by a reflectivity matrix whose components are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath35 , where the first subindex represents the polarization of the incident wave and the second sub - index the polarization of the reflected wave .    in figure",
    "( 2 ) we plot the casimir force normalized to the ideal case @xmath43 , for several values of the reduced frequency @xmath44 .",
    "all frequencies are normalized to the plasma frequency and the distances are normalized to the plasma wavelength @xmath45 .",
    "the value for the background dielectric function @xmath46 is for @xmath47 as reported by palik @xcite . in general , @xmath48 semiconductors ( e.g. @xmath49 ) can be used , since they exhibit a strong magnetoplasmon response . the important feature of fig .",
    "( 2 ) , is that as the magnetic field increases the casimir force decreases . for high magnetic fields ,",
    "there is a drop in @xmath50 as a function of separation , this drop is more significant with increasing magnetic field .    .",
