    "jet models predict the distribution of the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath2 : quasi - universal jet profile models predict an approximate power law distribution with index @xmath1 , where @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath2 is the total energy radiated if the observed flux were radiated isotropically . to study the distribution of burst intensities",
    ", we used the lag - luminosity relationship to create a burst database with redshifts , peak luminosities , and burst energies , and then we fit energy distributions to the burst database .",
    "of course , this database can be used for other studies .    in the lag - luminosity relation@xcite",
    "the peak bolometric luminosity @xmath4 is a function of the lag @xmath5 between two energy bands in the burst s frame@xmath6 .",
    "but @xmath7 is measured in our frame .",
    "we model @xmath8 : time dilation contributes -1 to c , while the redshifting of temporal structure with a smaller lag from higher energy contributes @xmath91/3 ( pulses are narrower at high energy ) .",
    "the peak bolometric luminosity is related to the peak bolometric energy flux @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the peak bolometric energy flux is related to the peak photon flux p ( integrated over an energy band , e.g. , 50300  kev for batse data ) : @xmath12 .",
    "the result is an implicit equation that must be solved for each burst : @xmath13\\ ] ] after solving eq .",
    "1 for the redshift , @xmath4 and @xmath2 can be calculated from @xmath14 and the energy fluence , respectively .",
    "the original lag - luminosity relation was a single power law , e.g. , @xmath15 .",
    "but this power law over - predicts the luminosity of grb980425 ( assuming this burst was sn1998bw ) . consequently salmonson@xcite and norris@xcite suggested breaking the single power law ; for @xmath160.35  s the power law index is -4.7 .",
    "a population of nearby , long lag bursts resulted .",
    "with a database of bursts with @xmath2 we can now calculate the energy distribution .",
    "the methodology presented here@xcite can also be applied to the luminosity function .",
    "the probability of detecting a given energy is truncated by the detection threshold : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the threshold value of @xmath2 for that burst and @xmath19 is the model ( e.g. , the functional form of the energy distribution ) with parameters @xmath20 . for the ensemble of bursts",
    "the probability of detecting bursts with the observed energies is @xmath21 where the product is over each burst .",
    "this probability is the likelihood for the model @xmath19 . in frequentist statistics , we maximize @xmath22 with respect to the parameters @xmath20 to get a best fit value . in bayesian statistics",
    "the likelihood is a factor in the `` posterior , '' which can be used for confidence ranges and best fit values ; the bayesian approach allows the use of `` priors '' reflecting our expectations for @xmath20 .",
    "note that to study the energy distribution we do not need a complete sample in terms of observed fluences , only a sample that has no bias on the intrinsic @xmath2",
    ". there can be gaps in the distribution of peak fluxes , but @xmath2 has to be drawn uniformly from @xmath23 in our sample . on the other hand , if we want the burst rate per comoving volume as a function of redshift , then we do need a complete sample .",
    "but is the resulting energy distribution a good representation of the data ?",
    "the likelihood ( frequentist approach ) or posterior ( bayesian approach ) can be used to compare models ( functional forms ) , but do not indicate `` goodness - of - fit . ''",
    "however , our methodology assumes the energies are drawn uniformly from @xmath23 .",
    "the cumulative distribution of @xmath24 should therefore be a straight line , and the average value should be 1/2 , with a statistical uncertainty of @xmath25^{-1/2}$ ] for @xmath26 bursts .",
    "we started with 1438 batse bursts for which we calculated lags .",
    "of these , 1218 have positive lags",
    ". these bursts also have hardness ratios , peak fluxes and durations . to calculate the average energy @xmath27 we used the `` grb '' spectral fits of mallozzi et al.@xcite to the peaks of 580 of these bursts . for the 858 bursts without fits we assumed average spectral indices",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "plotting hr@xmath30 ( the 100300  kev to 50100  kev hardness ratio ) vs. @xmath31 shows a clear correlation which can be approximated by @xmath31=240 hr@xmath32  kev ; we used this relation for the bursts without spectral fits .",
    "redshifts were calculated for this database for both the original simple power law lag - luminosity relation and the broken power law salmonson@xcite and norris@xcite introduced to incorporate grb980425 . as expected , the difference in the lag - luminosity relations is apparent at low redshifts : the broken power law results in a population of nearby bursts .",
    "there were few physically implausible high @xmath33 bursts ( e.g. , @xmath34 ) and thus no additional cutoffs on the lag - luminosity relation are required . in the absence of additional information , the choice between the two lag - luminosity relations depends on whether grb980425 is considered to be a typical low luminosity burst . for the remainder of this analysis we use a single power law lag - luminosity relation .    as an aside",
    ", we found that the redshift calculation is sensitive to the value of @xmath27 .",
    "calculating this quantity inconsistently can introduce errors into the resulting database .",
    "we calculated the energy @xmath2 for each burst from the redshift and energy fluence .",
    "the results were reasonable ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : few bursts had @xmath35  erg or @xmath36  erg .     vs. the detection threshold . ]",
    "the energy detection threshold @xmath18 can be calculated by scaling @xmath2 by the ratio of the threshold peak photon flux to the observed peak flux .",
    "batse s threshold peak flux was @xmath370.3 ph @xmath38 s@xmath39 ; however , the number of bursts in our sample with @xmath2 just above the threshold is suspiciously low ( see fig .  1 ) , suggesting that the sample s true threshold was greater than 0.3 ph @xmath38 s@xmath39 .",
    "consequently we used @xmath370.5 ph @xmath38 s@xmath39 as the threshold , deleting bursts with @xmath40 ph @xmath38 s@xmath39 .    the left hand side of fig .",
    "2 shows the likelihood surface for our sample assuming a power law functional form , where the two parameters are the low energy cutoff @xmath41 and the power law index @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) .",
    "the likelihood is maximized by @xmath41 equal to the lowest observed value @xmath2 , although lower values are not ruled out .",
    "the best fit spectral index is @xmath45 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "although @xmath46= 0.4642@xmath470.0089 ( @xmath26=1054 , assuming @xmath370.5 ph @xmath38 s@xmath39 ) deviates from 1/2 by @xmath48 , considering the possible systematic errors ( e.g. , in the estimation of @xmath31 from the hardness ratio ) , this value of @xmath49 indicates that a power law energy distribution is a fairly good characterization of the data .     and power law index @xmath42 ;",
    "the contours are spaced by @xmath50log(likelihood)=1 .",
    "the lognormal distribution has a central value @xmath51 and a logarithmic width @xmath52 ; the contours are spaced by @xmath50log(likelihood)=10.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and power law index @xmath42 ; the contours are spaced by @xmath50log(likelihood)=1 .",
    "the lognormal distribution has a central value @xmath51 and a logarithmic width @xmath52 ; the contours are spaced by @xmath50log(likelihood)=10.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we also tried a lognormal energy distribution ( right hand side of fig .",
    "the maximum likelihood occurs at @xmath53  ergs and @xmath54 .",
    "the surface s shape indicates that the data permit a high central value of @xmath2 and a narrow distribution , or a low central value of @xmath2 and a broad distribution .",
    "the observational cutoff truncates the true energy distribution , and the low energy extent is relatively unknown .",
    "we find @xmath55=0.4821@xmath560.0089 ( @xmath26=1054 , assuming @xmath370.5 ph @xmath38 s@xmath39 ) , consistent with 1/2 at the 2@xmath57 level .",
    "a quasi - universal jet profile that is a power law in the off - axis angle @xmath58the energy per solid angle @xmath59results in a power law energy distribution ( or luminosity function ) with index @xmath60 ( hence @xmath1 for @xmath61 ) , while a gaussian profile results in @xmath62 .",
    "lloyd - ronning et al.@xcite found that if the profile parameters are distributions , the luminosity functions could be approximated by power laws with @xmath63 for power law profiles and @xmath64 for gaussian profiles , but with curvature .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom introduced by varying the parameters give the jet models the freedom to fit a wide variety of energy distribution shapes .",
    "we find that our burst data can be fit by a power law energy distribution with @xmath45 ( 95% confidence ) ; considering only the statistical uncertainty the power law distribution is formally not a good fit , but with the likely systematic uncertainties the power law distribution is probably a good description of the data . while our power law fit is inconsistent with the original jet profile model ( @xmath61 and therefore @xmath1 ) , it is consistent with the jet profile models where parameters are permitted to vary .",
