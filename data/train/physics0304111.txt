    "propagation of plane flames in gaseous mixtures is well known to be unstable . an efficient way of investigating this instability is to consider the flame front as a surface of discontinuity , expanding all quantities of interest in powers of @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the flame front thickness , and @xmath2 characteristic length scale of a flame perturbation .",
    "the leading term of the perturbation growth rate expansion has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes an adiabatic velocity of a plane flame front with respect to the fuel , and @xmath5 a function of the gas expansion coefficient @xmath6 defined as the ratio of the fuel density ( @xmath7 ) and the density of burnt matter ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 according to refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath10 has positive values for all @xmath11 implying an unconditional instability of zero - thickness flames , the landau - darrieus ( ld ) instability . in the next order in @xmath12 account of the transport processes inside the flame front",
    "modifies eq .",
    "( [ sigma0 ] ) to @xmath13 where @xmath14 depends on @xmath6 as well as on the ratio of the heat and mass diffusivities ( the lewis number ) @xcite .",
    "the product @xmath15 the so - called cut - off wavelength , is the short wavelength limit of unstable perturbations . by the order of magnitude , @xmath16 represents also the characteristic length of the so - called cellular structure of the flame front , which is formed eventually as a result of the nonlinear flame stabilization . for many flames of practical interest ,",
    "@xmath17 it is the fact that @xmath1 is relatively small in comparison with @xmath16 which underlies the above point of view on flame dynamics .",
    "consider an arbitrary initially smooth front configuration . as a result of the rapid growth of the unstable flame perturbations with wavelengths @xmath18",
    "the flame front becomes corrugated within the time interval @xmath19 dynamics of the short wavelength modes are mainly determined by the transport processes inside the flame front , and are affected only slightly by the large scale flow .",
    "one can say that the small scale cellular structure of the flame front develops on the `` background '' of its smooth large scale configuration ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "it follows all developments of the background , eq .",
    "( [ ctime ] ) playing the role of the characteristic time of cell adaptation to the large scale front evolution .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in practice , it is the large scale evolution of the flame front , rather than its exact local structure , which is often of the main concern . in this respect",
    ", an important question arises about the reverse influence of the flame cellular structure on the front evolution at scales much larger than @xmath20 more precisely , one can state the problem as follows .",
    "imagine that we have smeared the small scale rapid variations of all relevant quantities by averaging them over many flame cells .",
    "then the question is what equations governing dynamics of the averages are .    in connection with the above statement of the problem",
    "it should be noted that the exact cellular structure of flames is actually unknown .",
    "this is because the process of cell formation is essentially nonlinear , in the sense that it can not be treated perturbatively in principle , which is the main reason of lack of its theoretical description . only in the case",
    "@xmath21 which is practically irrelevant , can this structure be determined analytically @xcite .",
    "the question of principle , therefore , is to what extent the large scale dynamics of averages depend on the exact local flame structure in the regime of fully developed ld - instability .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to show that to the leading order in the ratio of @xmath16 to the characteristic length of the problem ( @xmath22 ) , dynamics of the averaged quantities are actually independent of particularities of the local flame structure .",
    "the latter determines essentially only one parameter characterizing the large scale evolution  the effective normal velocity of the flame front .",
    "perhaps , it is worth to explain the essence of the problem in a little bit more detail .",
    "the above point of view on the flame propagation is based on the possibility to separate the local cellular dynamics from the large scale evolution of the background .",
    "this possibility is underlined by the following common property of the transport processes . from the mathematical point of view , all these processes are of higher differential order than those governing dynamics of an ideal fluid . therefore , their relative role increases at smaller scales . in particular , in the limit @xmath23 cell formation is completely determined by the transport processes inside the flame front . on the contrary , the role of these processes at scales @xmath24 is relatively small .",
    "it should be fully realized , however , that this reasoning is inherently linear .",
    "it tacitly assumes that if every quantity of interest , say @xmath25 is represented as a sum of its averaged value @xmath26 and the small scale fluctuation @xmath27 then the dynamics of @xmath28 s can be determined solely in terms of @xmath28 s themselves . because of the high nonlinearity of basic equations governing the flame propagation , this assumption is far from being self - evident .",
    "for instance , averaging of a cubic combination of @xmath29 s gives rise to a term @xmath30 comparable with @xmath31 since the small and large scale parts of the flow variables are generally of the same order of magnitude .",
    "clearly , equations for @xmath28 s involving such terms would not be of great value , since the local flame dynamics , and therefore , the coefficients @xmath32 are unknown .",
    "the main result of the present work is the proof that such terms actually do not arise in the leading order with respect to @xmath33 one can say that the governing equations for the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath34 decouple from each other .",
    "the proof consists of two parts corresponding to decoupling of the flow equations in the bulk , and decoupling of the jump conditions at the flame front , given in secs .",

    "the proved theorem considerably widens the scope of issues in flame dynamics accessible for analytical investigation .",
    "one of the most important consequences of the decoupling theorem is that unlike the local cellular dynamics , the large scale flame dynamics can be investigated in the framework of perturbation expansion with respect to the flame front slope , provided that the external field exerts a stabilizing influence on the flame .",
    "this fact will be illustrated below in the case of a flame propagating in an initially quiescent fluid in the direction of the gravitational field . as is well known ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in this case gravity plays the stabilizing role at the linear stage of development of the ld - instability",
    ". our aim will be to determine the role of the nonlinear effects , and to explore the possibility of a full stabilization of the curved flame front by the gravitational field .",
    "we will follow the general method of deriving weakly nonlinear equations for the flame front position , developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it consists in bringing the system of hydrodynamic equations together with the jump conditions at the flame front to the so - called transverse representation in which dependence of all flow variables on the coordinate in the direction of flame propagation ( @xmath121 ) is rendered purely parametric , and then reducing this system to a single equation for the front position .",
    "the calculation in the presence of gravity is very similar to that in the case of a freely propagating flame .",
    "therefore , derivation of the equation will be only sketched below , referring the reader to the work @xcite for more detail .    as was mentioned in the end of the preceding section ,",
    "it is natural to take @xmath247 as the velocity unit , redefining accordingly the units of length , time , and pressure to @xmath252 respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "designation of the flow variables as well as space coordinates and time will be left unchanged .",
    "then the bulk equations read @xmath253 since the fuel is assumed initially quiescent , the flow is potential upstream , and the general solution of eqs .",
    "( [ contgot ] ) , ( [ aveulergot ] ) can be readily written down . in the reference frame of an initially plane flame front",

    "nevertheless , the following transverse relation between the flow variables downstream can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ contgot ] ) , ( [ aveulergot ] ) at the second order of nonlinearity @xmath259 equations ( [ finalj1])([gotevolution ] ) , ( [ solup2 ] ) , ( [ solup3 ] ) , and ( [ streamgot ] ) constitute the closed system of equations describing flame dynamics in the transverse representation .",
    "it can be reduced to the following equation for the function @xmath248 @xmath260 the linear terms in this equation reproduce the well - known equation @xmath261 from which it follows that at the linear stage of development of the ld - instability , the gravitational field plays the stabilizing role in the case of flame propagation in the direction of @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) , and destabilizing in the opposite case ( @xmath264 ) . to determine the role of the nonlinear terms ,",
    "let us assume that there exists a stationary regime of flame propagation .",
    "it should be stressed that this assumption concerns only the the large scale front structure described by the function @xmath265 the local cellular structure does not need to be stationary .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ nonstationary ] ) simplifies to @xmath266 it is not difficult to see that the nonlinear term proportional to @xmath267 exerts a stabilizing influence on the flame if @xmath268 indeed , if we take @xmath269 eq .  ( [ nonstationary ] ) can be roughly considered as a `` dispersion relation '' for the increment @xmath270 as we see , the nonlinear term decreases @xmath271 if @xmath272 and vice versa .",
    "therefore , eq",
    ".  ( [ stationary ] ) can only have solutions if @xmath272 and the question of whether the flame can be stabilized by the gravitational field reduces to the question of existence of nontrivial solutions to this equation .",
    "equation ( [ stationary ] ) is a nonlinear integro - differential equation with respect to @xmath273 to solve this equation , we first transform it as follows .",
    "let us rewrite the nonlinear term @xmath274 iterating eq .  ( [ stationary ] ) with respect to @xmath275 _ i.e. , _ substituting @xmath276 one has @xmath277 using the well - known identity @xmath278 we find @xmath279 hence , within the accuracy of the second order , eq .",
    "( [ stationary ] ) takes the form @xmath280 where @xmath281 in connection with the transformation performed , it is worth to emphasize validity of the weak nonlinearity expansion when applied to the investigation of the large scale flame dynamics . as was shown in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , this expansion turns out to be self - contradictory in the case of a freely propagating stationary flame treated in the framework of the thin front model .",
    "this fact can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ stationary ] ) with @xmath282 in which case this equation reduces to the equality of two quantities of apparently different orders  @xmath283 and @xmath284 only if @xmath285 does the weak nonlinearity expansion of stationary flames make sense , since then @xmath286 @xmath287",
    "so both terms in eq .",
    "( [ stationary ] ) are @xmath288 quantities . on the contrary , in the presence of the gravitational field ,",
    "@xmath289 _ can _ be treated as the first order quantity when @xmath290 is not small , because @xmath291 and @xmath292 are of the first order in this case , and nothing prevents their sum from being formally a second order quantity .",
    "in fact , @xmath290 _ must _ be finite in the latter case , since the second order term @xmath293 would be the only second order term in eq .",
