    "during the past two decades gravitational microlensing surveys have transformed from a bold theoretical idea @xcite into an important tool for studying the stellar population of our galaxy . following paczyski s proposal ,",
    "four different monitoring programs , macho @xcite , ogle @xcite , eros @xcite and moa @xcite , have for years collected data on the galactic center as well as lmc and smc , detecting many thousands of microlensing events .",
    "two microlensing surveys that are still currently in operation , ogle - iv and moa , continue to add to this number at a rate of roughly 1000 events per year .",
    "while the majority of the detected events are consistent with being produced by a single - mass lens , a sizable fraction shows clear evidence of lens binarity @xcite .",
    "these are particularly interesting , because more complicated lightcurves ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) produced by binary lenses allow us to learn considerably more about these systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the signatures of lens binarity are most prominent when the projected orbital separation between the two binary components , @xmath0 , is of the order of the einstein radius : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the distances to the source and the lens , respectively and @xmath4 is the total mass of the lens .",
    "the timescale for the duration of the lensing event is determined by the einstein radius crossing time @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative velocity between the lens and the source as viewed by the observer . for solar - mass lenses in the galactic disk @xmath7",
    "is typically on the order of months , while the orbital period of the lensing binary , @xmath8 , is more likely to be measured in years . as a result",
    ", most binary lensing events can be modeled while completely neglecting orbital motion of the two masses ( see e.g. recent estimates by * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , a handful of microlensing lightcurves do show convincing evidence of binary phase change during the event @xcite .",
    "and recently there has been an increase of interest in the possibility of finding lensing events for which the timescale ratio , defined as @xmath9 is of order of or greater than unity @xcite .",
    "if the orbital period can be determined for such systems , it will provide a new avenue toward extracting the lens parameters .",
    "specifically , the period relates the total mass to the orbital separation .",
    "if the value of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can also be determined , we have some of the key elements needed to specify the binary . in cases when some additional information is available , e.g. , because the lens is located nearby and/or because parallax or finite - source - size effects are detected , a full binary solution may be obtained .",
    "unlike single - lens lightcurves which have a simple analytical form @xcite , binary lenses can produce very complex magnification patterns which can not be expressed in a closed form . even for a stationary binary lens , the process of fitting an observed lightcurve can be complex @xcite .",
    "the addition of orbital motion complicates the fitting process even further . fortunately , in the limit when @xmath12 the binarity features observed in the microlensing lightcurves show very strong periodicity which allow @xmath13 to be determined via simple lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram analysis @xcite . in this paper , however , we are primarily interested in the regime when @xmath14 . for these longer - period binaries the interplay between the orbital motion and the projected motion of the source causes the period determined via ls analysis to differ significantly from @xmath15 @xcite . here",
    "we describe a modified timing analysis method which allows us to compensate for this relative motion and extract the correct binary period of the lens .",
    "a microlensing event produced by a single lens can be completely characterized by three parameters : @xmath16 , the einstein radius of the system ; @xmath17 , the distance of closest approach between the lens and the projection of the source onto the lens plane ( measured in units of @xmath16 ) ; and @xmath6 , the transverse velocity of the source with respect to the lens . in general , we can express the separation between the lens and the source projection ( measured again in units of @xmath16 ) as @xmath18 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the time of closest approach .",
    "the resulting lightcurve is described in terms of the amplification function , defined as the ratio of the observed lensed and unlensed fluxes , which takes the form @xmath20    when the lens is a binary , in addition to the total mass of the system , @xmath21 , we need to specify the mass ratio @xmath22 and the dimensionless semi - major axis of the binary , @xmath23 , to fully describe the microlensing event . for simplicity ,",
    "in this paper we consider only face - on , circular binary orbits , so @xmath10 is equal to the binary separation at all times .",
    "since the lens is rotating , two more parameters are necessary : the value of the binary phase angle ( shown as angle @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) at the moment of closest approach , @xmath25 , and the direction of binary rotation with respect to the relative motion vector . for the source velocity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] , we define a binary to be _ prograde _ if it is rotating clockwise and _ retrograde _ otherwise .",
    "since general relativity is a non - linear theory , the light curve produced by a binary lens is more complicated than a simple superposition of two amplification functions and can not be described by an analytical formula .",
    "however , we can calculate the amplification value numerically as a function of source position in the lens plane @xcite .",
    "the result depends only on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "given @xmath17 and @xmath6 , we can calculate the trajectory of the source projection in the plane of binary lens and construct the resulting lightcurve .",

    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are coordinates in the lens frame , scaled to @xmath16 .",
    "the residual contours exhibit a nearly - symmetrical four - lobe shape .",
    "note that the longer lobes ( lined up with the y - axis ) correspond to positive @xmath33 values , while the shorter ones have @xmath34 . for face - on circular orbits",
    "@xmath10 is time - independent and the amplification map is static . in the co - moving and co - rotating frame of the lens , the source appears to spiral in as it moves towards the point of closest approach and spiral out as it moves away from the lens .",
    "if the source were stationary , one full rotation of the binary lens would result in two full oscillations of the residual lightcurve .",
    "thus , the periodicity of the residual signal is related to the orbital period of the binary lens by @xmath35 note that the relation is not exact due to the modification caused by relative transverse motion between the source and the lens .",
    "both panels show the contour plot of the absolute residual magnification function , @xmath30 , produced by the standard system ( described in  [ sec : stdsys ] ) .",

    "panel ( a ) shows the trajectory of the source with @xmath38 for the prograde binary lens , while panel ( b ) corresponds to the retrograde case ( the lightcurve is identical to the one shown in fig .",

    "finally , the angle between the source position and the axis of the binary is then @xmath50 the distance from the source to the center of mass in the lens plane , @xmath51 is given by eq . .",
    "note that the position of the source in the co - rotating lens plane is simply @xmath52    a natural consequence of eq .",
    "is that the angular velocity of the source in the lens plane , @xmath53 , is smaller for a prograde system than that for a retrograde system .",
    "this effect manifests itself clearly in the apparent period of residual signals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : proretromaglc ] , which compares the trajectories of the source for a prograde and retrograde system with otherwise identical physical parameters .",
    "the retrograde residual lightcurve shows much faster oscillations due to having a larger value of @xmath54",
    "we now address the question of how to extract the information about the orbital periodicity of the binary lens from the observed microlensing lightcurves .",
    "we start by generating a theoretical binary lightcurve , add noise to simulate real survey data , subtract the dominant single - lens signal , perform spectral analysis on the the residuals and examine the accuracy of the inferred orbital period .",

    "because of its relatively large amplitude , this high - frequency feature dominates our timing analysis and since it is never repeated no significant period is detected in the data .",
    "a simple way of dealing with this issue is to simply remove the high - frequency part of the lightcurve so that the global low - frequency signal in given more weight in the timing analysis . to determine which part of the lightcurve to remove , we estimated the average radius of the red region to be @xmath126 , and removed the corresponding portion of the lightcurve , i.e. the region with the overall magnification higher than @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is given by eq .",

    "we show in  [ sec : lownoise ] that the detection rates for this system are very sensitive to the photometric precision of the data ; with smaller noise the detectability can become very high ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lownoise]c ) .",
    "we now consider the effect of having a larger binary separation while keeping all the other parameters the same . with @xmath144 ,",
    "this lensing system will produce lightcurves characterized by much more pronounced deviations from the single - lens form",
    ". however , larger @xmath0 implies longer @xmath13 and therefore smaller @xmath142 , making period detection more difficult .",
    "the results for the detection rates are shown in fig . [ fig:6sys](d ) .",
    "in contrast to the small - separation system discussed in the section above , the overall detection rate for the wide binary lightcurves shows only a moderate decrease compared to the standard case .",
    "however , the correct detection rate drops significantly , reaching a maximum of @xmath145 near @xmath146 and dropping off to zero for @xmath147 .",
    "if we investigate the prograde and retrograde lightcurves separately , we can see that the gap between the two detection rates is caused predominantly by the prograde systems .",
    "in fact , taken by themselves , prograde lightcurves have the correct detection rate close to zero .",
    "the reason for this is simple . at @xmath148",
    "this binary straddles the boundary of detectability since its orbital period is slightly longer than the length of the microlensing event .",
    "in prograde binaries the effective period of the residuals is larger than @xmath8 , so detection becomes virtually impossible . for retrograde binaries , the effective period is smaller than @xmath8 and can therefore be still detected .",
    "while monitoring observations from the ground are unlikely to have photometric errors smaller than @xmath149 , space - based missions , such as _ kepler _ , can do roughly 1000 times better .",
    "it is highly likely that multiple microlensing events will occur in the _ kepler _ field over the lifetime of the mission , so it is worthwhile to consider how our period detection method would fare for data with photometric precision on the order of @xmath150 . to that end , we have computed the period detection rates for our four systems in this low noise limit . since high precision photometry would allow us to detect much smaller deviations , we expanded the length of our simulated lightcurves to @xmath151 , instead of @xmath152 we adopted for higher noise levels .",
    "[ fig : lownoise ] shows our new detection rates for the four systems .",
    "it is clear that the main effect of increasing photometric precision is a significant increase in detection rates , especially at high @xmath17 .",
    "this result makes perfect sense : at large @xmath17 , the overall lightcurve amplification as well as deviations from the point - lens form become small enough as to be non - detectable from the ground , but perfectly discernible from space .",
    "note that the overall rate of period detection now remains flat at essentially 100% all the way beyond @xmath153 .",
    "examining retrograde and prograde lightcurves separately , we again find that most of the gap between the overall and correct detection rates is attributable to prograde rotation .",
    "the systems affected the most by the change in noise levels are the tight and wide binaries .",
    "the results for the former are particularly striking ; where before we could detect at most @xmath145 of the periods , we now can detect the correct period for any lightcurve .",
    "the main reason for this improvement is again entirely due to the fact that very small amplitude signal can now be clearly detected .",
    "the value of @xmath10 for this system places the binary features in the microlensing lightcurves at the edge of detectability with 1% errorbars , but this is not the case with improved precision .    for the wide binary ,",
    "the periods for prograde lightcurves were largely not detectable which higher noise levels since the length of the event was simply too long compared with the orbital period of the lens .",
    "improved sensitivity allows us to follow the event for a much longer time , effectively decreasing the minimum value of @xmath142 for which the periods can be reliably detected .",
    "while the minimum value of @xmath142 for which our timing analysis can be applied is set by the photometric precision of the data , we can place a firmer limit on the upper value of @xmath142 for which our method is important .",
    "clearly , when @xmath154 , the lens - source relative motion becomes irrelevant and standard ls analysis should yield the correct period ( up to a factor of 2 ) for such a binary lens .",
    "[ fig : modlscompare ] illustrates when the standard method results begin to deviate significantly from the actual orbital period .",
    "the black and red curves show the timing analysis results for a series of lightcurves , all with @xmath155 , produced by lensing binaries with @xmath142 spanning the range between 0.1 and 2 .",
    "all the other parameters were chosen to be the same as for our standard system with the exception of @xmath0 , which was adjusted to vary @xmath8 and therefore @xmath142 .     for ls ( black triangles ) and modified ls ( red squares ) periodogram methods .",
    "the results for the former were divided by a factor of 2 to compensate for the symmetry of the amplification pattern .",
    "top and bottom panels show the results for retrograde and prograde lightcurves , respectively.,width=316 ]    fig . [",
    "fig : modlscompare ] shows that our proposed timing analysis method is very successful in extracting the correct orbital periods for the entire range of timescale ratios above the minimum set by the length of the lightcurves , @xmath10 becomes very small , but the periods are still detectable with the low - noise data .",
    "this would not be the case for 1% photometry ; however , other lensing parameters can be adjusted to ensure that the value of @xmath10 remains within a detectable range ( see * ? ? ?",
    "so our conclusions for @xmath142 are still applicable . ] , while the standard ls periodogram algorithm clearly begins to fail ( i.e. the detected period differs from the actual value by more than @xmath156 ) when @xmath157 for prograde lenses and @xmath158 for retrograde lenses .",
    "when the einstein crossing time is comparable to the orbital period of a binary lens , microlensing lightcurves display quasi - periodic features which can be used to determine @xmath8 . in the limit",
    "when @xmath12 , the standard ls periodogram analysis can be used to find the period . however , in this paper we focus on the regime with @xmath14 when the variability timescale in observed lightcurves is set by a combination of binary rotation and relative source - lens motion .",
    "we have shown that this regime includes specific systems with orbital periods in the range from months to years .",
    "for such lightcurves the standard periodogram yields incorrect periods ( see fig . [",
    "fig : oldnewpowerspectrum ] ) .",
    "here we proposed a modification to the timing analysis method designed to compensate for the source motion and extract the correct orbital period .",
    "we tested our new timing analysis method on simulated lightcurves for four different binary lens systems and calculated period detection rates for a wide range of impact parameter values .",
    "the results are very encouraging .",
    "as long as the orbital period is detectable ( i.e. not longer than the length of the simulated lightcurve ) our proposed method finds and identifies it correctly in a large fraction of cases .",
    "we find that the period detection rates are determined primarily by the photometric precision and three interdependent parameters , @xmath10 , @xmath142 and @xmath17 .",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly , the photometric precision is the most important .",
    "it determines the minimum value of @xmath10 for which binarity of the lens is detectable @xcite and sets the maximum value of @xmath17 for which a microlensing event is distinguishable from the noise .",
    "it also essentially sets the maximum practical length for a lightcurve which in turn determines the maximum detectable orbital period and therefore places a lower limit on @xmath142 .",
    "we consider two levels of photometric uncertainty : 1% , characteristic of ground - based data , and 0.001% , relevant for dedicated space missions such as kepler . in the first case ,",
    "the reasonable event duration is @xmath152 ( beyond this , the wings disappear into the noise ) and , correspondingly , the detection rate drops off for @xmath159 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : modlscompare ] and well as by our results for the wide binary lens in ",
    "[ sec : wide ] .",
    "high - precision photometry allows us to significantly expand the parameter space for which the orbital periods can be reliably detected with our method .",
    "the results we discuss in this paper are based on the analysis of lightcurves produced by binary lenses in face - on circular orbits .",
    "we are now in the process of extending our calculations to include elliptical and inclined orbits . in these more complex situations , the projected binary separation , and with it the shape of the lensing magnification pattern , will vary with time during the microlensing event .",
    "this effect will certainly affect the spacing of the features in the residual lightcurves , possibly affecting the extraction of the orbital period .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that the orbital period should still be detectable in a large fraction of lightcurves , but the full report will be the subject of a follow - up paper .    finally , we want to point out that in its present form , our timing analysis method works best for binary lenses with @xmath11 not very different from unity .",
    "it is predicated on the assumption that the oscillatory features repeat twice per orbit .",
    "the fact that period detectability does not change much from @xmath160 to @xmath161 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6sys][a ] and [ b ] ) shows that some asymmetry in the magnification pattern can be easily tolerated .",
    "we tested lower values of @xmath11 for the unequal - mass system and found that the detectability decreases by a factor @xmath162 for @xmath163 and drops below @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "it is clear that in the planetary regime ( i.e. , when @xmath166 ) a factor of 2 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : modcj ] ) and ( [ eq : modsj ] ) does not apply , since the magnification pattern is no longer even remotely symmetrical @xcite .",
    "fortunately , such systems produce visibly different lightcurve morphologies characterized by very spiky rather than sinusoidal features ( see * ? ? ? * for some examples of lightcurves produced by low-@xmath11 binary lenses ) , and so can be flagged .",
