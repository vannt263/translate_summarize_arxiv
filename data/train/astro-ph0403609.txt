    "in the last decade , a multitude of evidence for the presence of crystalline silicates in various astrophysical environments has emerged . in particular , infrared spectra have revealed that silicates in circumstellar environments often contain a significant crystalline fraction , both around post - main - sequence stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and pre - main - sequence stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , crystalline silicates are ubiquitous in the solar system , not only in the more evolved bodies such as planets , but also in primitive objects like comets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because crystallization is inhibited by high energy barriers , the origin and evolution of the crystalline silicate fraction in interstellar and circumstellar media has the potential to provide direct evidence of the energetic processing of grains .",
    "the life cycle of dust starts in the outflow of evolved stars , continues upon ejection in the interstellar medium and eventually ends in the planet forming disk around a young star .",
    "it is surprising that , whereas at the beginning and end of dust grains lifes crystallinity is prevalent , no crystallinity is found in the intermediate phase ( i.e.  in the diffuse interstellar medium ) .",
    "in fact , a relatively high upper limit to the degree of crystallinity in the diffuse ism has been determined recently @xcite .",
    "less than 5% by number of the interstellar si - atoms were found to be incorporated in crystalline silicate grains of @xmath4 @xmath0 m in size , which is roughly equivalent to a mass fraction of @xmath5% . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have suggested that , while the broad and structureless interstellar 10 @xmath0 m absorption feature is commonly ascribed to amorphous silicates , the crystalline spectral detail may be washed out in a very complex mixture of crystalline silicates . furthermore , some studies on silicates in the dense ism have reported the ( controversial ) detection of crystalline silicate features @xcite , but one has to bear in mind that this environment has very different physical properties than the diffuse ism .    in this work",
    ", we will re - address the issue of crystallinity in the diffuse ism by studying the line - of - sight towards the galactic center .",
    "because of its large amount of extinction and its high infrared flux , the sightline towards the galactic center has often been used to characterize the properties of interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "we will study the 10 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature in order to determine the degree of crystallinity in this line - of - sight . in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] we will discuss the iso sws observations and data reduction , as well as the characteristics of the region around sgr a@xmath6 and the correction method applied for emission intrinsic to the galactic center ( gc ) region . the method used to determine the dust composition in the diffuse ism is described in sect .",

    "during the life time of the iso mission @xcite , 2.38  45.2 @xmath0 m sws spectra @xcite of the galactic center and two sight lines in the nearby quintuplet cluster were obtained .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] gives an overview of these observations .",
    "the galactic center region is very crowded , while the beam iso used for the sws observations is very large . in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] the orientation and positions of the beam is indicated on a 12.4 @xmath0 m map of the galactic center @xcite .",

    "irs sources 1 , 2 , 9 and 10 lie along an arc on the so - called ridge , generally believed to be a complex of hii regions .",
    "irs 7 is a late - type supergiant and is the brightest 2.2 @xmath0 m source in the vicinity of the galactic center .",
    "irs 3 , an oh / ir star , shows the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature in absorption @xcite . in the large sws beam",
    ", the mid - ir emission is dominated by the extended emission associated with irs 1 .",
    "gcs 3 and 4 are members of the quintuplet cluster . the positions of the beams are indicated on the isocam image presented in fig .  1 of the study by @xcite .",
    "in the observation of gcs 3 , the beam was centered on gcs 3-i ( or q4 ) , however , gcs 3-ii ( or q2 ) is the brightest mid - infrared source in the beam and dominates the measured spectrum @xcite .",
    "the full iso sws spectrum of the line - of - sight towards galactic center was first published by @xcite .",
    "we chose to reduce this spectrum again to fully address the problems caused by the detector memory effects in band 2 .",
    "in addition , we used the sws spectra of gcs 3 and 4 as a reference to correct for the silicate emission intrinsic to the sgr a@xmath6 region .",
    "the spectra of gcs 3 and 4 were previously published in the fore - mentioned work by @xcite , but we redid the data reduction to be consistent with the reduction of the spectrum of sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "we used the interactive analysis package ( ia@xmath7 ) to reduce all three spectra .",
    "in addition to the automated routines provided in this package , the up and down scans were analyzed separately to remove glitches and detector jumps by hand . to correct for the detector memory effects , most prominently present in band 2 ( ranging from 4.08 to 12.0 @xmath0 m ) ,",
    "the fouks - schubert model was applied ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : memory ] ) . from the spectra in band",
    "2c and all sub - bands of band 3 ( ranging from 7.00 to 29.0 @xmath0 m ) we removed residual fringes which were present after the relative spectral responsivity function ( rsrf ) was applied .",
    "rebinning according to actual spectral resolution was performed ( @xmath8 for the speed 4 observations of sgr a@xmath1 ; @xmath9 for the speed 3 spectra of gcs 3 and 4 ) , and data points deviating more than 3@xmath10 per bin were removed , resulting in a loss of 2% of the data points .",
    "narrow spectral lines were excluded from sigma - clipping .",
    "finally the spectra from the individual detectors were rescaled to the average flux levels to produce a smooth spectrum rather than a dot cloud .",
    "it is known that iso sws spectroscopy suffers from memory effects in the data , a problem predominantly found in data from bands 2 and 4 ( i.e.  the wavelength ranges from 4.0812.0 @xmath0 m and 29.045.2 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the semi - conductors that the detectors consist of do not fully discharge between subsequent measurements in a wavelength scan . when the flux levels in a certain ( sub-)band vary only by a small amount , this is not a large problem , since the amount of memory in each measurement will be more or less constant , and simply generates an offset in the flux levels .",
    "the relative flux levels will not be affected , so it may be relatively easy to correct for the memory when subtracting the _",
    "dark current_. in cases where a large variation in flux levels occurs within one sub - band , the memory effects require additional attention .",
    "this is the case in band 2c , ranging from 7.0012.0 @xmath0 m , which contains the entire interstellar absorption feature due to silicates .",
    "the discharging of the semi - conducting material can be described with a set of differential equations @xcite .",
    "this model expresses the time delay in the charging on the incident intensity .",
    "the larger the change in flux levels , the longer it takes to reach the charging corresponding to the incident flux .",
    "@xcite has applied the fouks - schubert model to the data in band 2 , and was able to correct for the memory effects .",
    "the successful application of this model can be easily checked by comparing the data of the up- and down - scans separately , since the memory effects should affect these data in opposite wavelength directions .",
    "this difference is minimized when the memory correction is applied successfully .",
    "only a very small residual memory effect remains .",
    "the application of the fouks - schubert model to correct for memory effects in band two , which was first developed for the data analysis of the gc line - of - sight @xcite , is now implemented in the ia@xmath7 package and the iso standard pipe line data products @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows the iso sws spectra of sgr a@xmath6 , gcs 3 and gcs 4 . since it is thought that the absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m is caused by interstellar dust particles along the line - of - sight , and that the dust composition along those lines - of - sight is very similar , it is remarkable that the 10 @xmath0 m absorption feature towards sgr a@xmath6 seems to be much narrower than the features observed towards the quintuplet stars .",
    "this is illustrated in panel b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : mem ] , which gives the raw optical depth @xmath11 for gcs 3 and sgr a@xmath1 calculated directly from @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a continuum determined using fourth order polynomial fitting .    the stars in the quintuplet cluster are identified as carbon - rich wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that there are no circumstellar silicates that give rise to emission or absorption features intrinsic to the quintuplet stars and that the shape of the feature is entirely determined by interstellar absorption .",
    "indeed , @xcite conclude that the quintuplet cluster does not contain any gas or dust between its stellar components and that the silicate absorption feature is a truly interstellar feature .",
    "we assume that the dust composition in the line - of - sight towards sgr a@xmath1 does not differ much from that towards the quintuplet sources , and therefore conclude that the difference of the absorption profile can be explained by silicate emission intrinsic to the sgr a@xmath1 region .",
    "it has been reported that the line - of - sight towards the gc contains more molecular clouds than those toward the quintuplet sources @xcite .",
    "we assume that this only leads to a difference in optical depth , and not to a difference in dust composition .",
    "rather , we attribute the difference in the 10 @xmath0 m profile of sgr a@xmath6 and the quintuplet sources to the presence of underlying silicate emission in the former . since the s / n of the spectrum observed towards sgr a@xmath1",
    "is much better than the data of the quintuplet source , we are aiming to correct for the silicate emission local to sgr a@xmath1 to obtain the intrinsic interstellar profile .",
    "we assume that the silicate contribution local to sgr a@xmath1 gives rise to the same feature in emission as it does in absorption .",
    "likely , the silicate emission is associated with dust in the hii region , irs 1 . because the resulting observed absorption feature is determined by the intrinsic emission and interstellar absorption",
    ", we applied an iterative process to determine the shape of the interstellar absorption and gc emission feature .",
    "the differences with gcs 3 or gcs 4 are minimized ( the best results are achieved for gcs 3 , see panel c ) and d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : mem ] ) , finally resulting in the corrected interstellar absorption feature .",
    "panel e ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : mem ] shows the spectral appearance of the gc silicate emission feature , where the reader must keep in mind that : first , the emission is the sum of all the mid - infrared sources in the iso beam , and second , the spectrum is only de - reddened for the optical depth _ in _ the feature and that the fact that the silicate interstellar absorption feature is superposed on a extinction continuum is ignored .",
    "a similar correction to determine the interstellar absorption in the 10 @xmath0 m feature was first performed by @xcite , who used the silicate profile of red supergiant @xmath0 cep as a template for the interstellar absorption in order to de - redden their observations of the galactic center environment .",
    "this was justified by the resemblance between the @xmath0 cep silicate feature and the absorption feature observed towards a number of carbon - rich wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "the corrected optical depth @xmath14 is presented in fig .  [ fig : mem]c and fig .  [ fig : tau ] and can be compared directly to the opacity of the various dust components at these wavelengths .",
    "the mass absorption coefficient @xmath15 correlates to the optical depth according to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance to the galactic center , @xmath18 is the average density of the considered dust species , @xmath19 is the number density of grains and @xmath20 the average mass of a dust grain .",
    "we can define a the mass column density @xmath21 and thus fit the 10@xmath0 m absorption feature by solving :    @xmath22     for @xmath23 .",
    "a continuum subtraction is performed on the mass absorption coefficients between the same wavelength boundaries which were used to obtain the optical depth in the interstellar 10 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "consequently only the contribution to the optical depth in features is taken into account .    in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) we applied the @xmath2 fitting method , which involves minimizing    @xmath24    where the @xmath25 is the uncertainty in the measured values arising from our data reduction procedure .",
    "they represent the spread in individual measurements of the twelve different sws detectors , before the spectrum was collapsed into one point per spectral bin . a measure for the goodness of the fit",
    "is given by the reduced @xmath2 value , @xmath26 , defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 represents the number of data points in the spectrum , and @xmath30 gives the number of free parameters .",
    "the @xmath26 values derived by our fitting method can be very high ( at least @xmath31 ) , while textbook examples always require this value to be close to unity .",
    "two different effects contribute to these high values .",
    "first , @xmath25 is only determined by the random scatter in the measurements , while the systematic errors in the flux levels can be significantly higher than that .",
    "sources for these systematic errors could be residuals of the memory effect , which can be as high as 2% in either direction or features introduced by the responsivity functions .",
    "second , the application of a @xmath2 fitting method assumes that the model does not contain uncertainties .",
    "in fact the model spectra we use are based on mass absorption coefficients measured in the laboratory and therefore have intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "it is hard to quantify the combined effect of the uncertainties in the laboratory spectra and the systematic errors in the iso sws data .",
    "we have elected to use only the uncertainties directly resulting from the iso sws data in the @xmath2 fitting method .",
    "we performed fits with different dust components , both amorphous and crystalline silicates .",
    "first , we have determined confidence levels for the fit with only amorphous dust components ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : amorphous ] ) using the method discussed by @xcite .",
    "in addition we use the @xmath32-test @xcite to determine the goodness of the fits when crystalline silicates were added .",
    "this test shows how much a @xmath2 fit improves if a parameter is added .",
    "the value @xmath33 is calculated from    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the decrease in @xmath2 between the initial and new fit , and @xmath26 is the value from the fit with the extra parameter added ( i.e.  the new fit ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 measures the relative improvement of a the @xmath2 of a fit to randomly scattered data when an additional component is included .",
    "the larger @xmath32 , the more significant is the improvement ( see e.g.  p.  209 of * ? ? ?",
    "in order to find the mass fraction contained in the crystalline silicates , the total mass in the amorphous component has to be determined , which depends on its composition .",
    "the chemical composition of amorphous silicates is determined by the formation path .",
    "amorphous silicates resulting from the amorphization of crystalline silicates will have the stoichiometry of that crystal , while amorphous silicates formed through direct condensation from a gas cloud or by collisions and subsequent merging of two distinct grains are most likely to have a non - stoichiometric composition .",
    "most measurements of the optical properties of amorphous silicates are limited to the stoichiometries of olivines and pyroxenes , except for a recent study by @xcite , who applied the sol - gel method to construct amorphous silicates of some selected non - stoichiometric compositions . in the sol - gel method",
    "mg- and si - hydroxides ( mg(oh)@xmath36 and si(oh)@xmath37 ) are mixed in the liquid phase .",
    "extraction of h@xmath36o by chemical reaction between the mg- and si - hydroxides then gives rise to the formation of silicates . because the two components can be mixed in any desired ratio , it is possible to synthesize non - stochiometric amorphous mg - silicates . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to the work by @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral appearance of these materials does not match the interstellar absorption feature , therefore we will only consider stoichiometric compositions . we have used the optical constants determined by @xcite for olivine ( mgfesio@xmath37 ) and pyroxene ( mgfesi@xmath36o@xmath38 ) .",
    "the use of laboratory optical constants allows us to immediately convert the derived optical depths into column densities of dust as well as derive their chemical composition .",
    "the appearance of the 10 @xmath0 m feature depends on the grain shape and grain size of the silicate particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig : asils ] an overview of the most important effects is given , for both amorphous olivine and pyroxene .",
    "small spherical grains ( up to @xmath39 @xmath0 m in size ) all produce exactly the same shape for the spectral feature . for larger grains ,",
    "the feature starts to broaden towards longer wavelengths . this effect becomes stronger with increasing grain size .",
    "the use of non - spherical grains , represented by a continuous distribution of ellipsoids ( cde ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tends to shift the peak of the feature to longer wavelengths . with cde calculations it is impossible to include any information on grains size .",
    "amorphous olivine in the form of spherical grains small in size compared to the wavelength ( the rayleigh limit ) provide a good fit to the 10 @xmath0 m feature @xcite .",
    "it is even possible to exclude the presence of a high fraction of larger grains as well as more than 1% of the mass in the form of forsterite , based on this spectrum @xcite .",
    "we find however , that the fit using just amorphous olivine can be further improved by adding amorphous pyroxene ( also in small spherical grains ) .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion that part of the silicates in the ism are converted from olivines into pyroxenes to explain the pyroxene presence in protostars @xcite .",
    "our result that spherical grains smaller than @xmath39 @xmath0 m are responsible for the 10 @xmath0 m absorption feature is more or less consistent with the ism grain size distribution determined by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "mrn ) , which has an upper limit of 0.25 @xmath0 m . based on a rosat study of the x - ray scattering halo of nova cygni 1992",
    ", @xcite found that they needed to extend the mrn grain size distribution to sizes much larger than 0.25 @xmath0 m in order to explain the observed scattering halo .",
    "in contrast , the same observations led @xcite to conclude they did not need such large grains ; grains with sizes larger than 0.4 @xmath0 m accounted for only a small amount of the observed scattering . still a significant contribution to the scattering",
    "is caused by the 0.10.4 @xmath0 m sized grains , while these grains do not really contribute to the 10 @xmath0 m silicate absorption profile discussed in this study .",
    "of course , the determination of grain sizes through x - ray scattering is weighted towards larger grain sizes , since those grains dominate the forward scattering cross section , while the infrared absorption profile is determined by the volume weighted average of the silicate grain size distribution , putting less weigth on this discrepancy between the ir and x - ray results .",
    "the best fit ( lowest @xmath2 value ) of the 10 @xmath0 m feature using small spherical olivine and pyroxene grains is given in panel a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] .",
    "we find that olivine contributes 84.9 % by mass and pyroxene 15.1 % , for a fit of the 10 @xmath0 m feature between 8.3 and 12.3 @xmath0 m .",
    "the remaining residues are at most of the order of @xmath40 which is about 3 % of the optical depth in the 10 @xmath0 m feature itself .",
    "these results were achieved using only the amorphous silicates with number ratio mg / fe = 1 .",
    "@xcite have measured the optical properties of amorphous pyroxenes mg@xmath41fe@xmath42sio@xmath43 , with x=0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.95 , and 1.0 and olivines mg@xmath44fe@xmath45sio@xmath37 with x=0.4 and 0.5 .",
    "the synthesis of silicates with values of @xmath46 outside the listed range ( i.e. @xmath47 for the pyroxenes and @xmath48 or @xmath49 for the olivines ) resulted in the formation of crystalline rather than amorphous silicates ( c.  jger , _",
    "priv.comm._ ) .",
    "the spectral differences within the pyroxene and olivine family are smaller than the differences between those families .",
    "we have determined the @xmath2 and @xmath50 values for several amorphous silicate mixtures , and found that only a few combinations led to an improvement according to the @xmath32-test .",
    "the @xmath32-values are only modest ( of the order of 200 at most ) compared to the improvements achieved when the crystalline silicates are added ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : f ] ) , and indicate that the pyroxenes are probably slightly mg - rich , with a composition between mg@xmath51fe@xmath51sio@xmath43 and mg@xmath52fe@xmath53sio@xmath43 .",
    "although the sampling of the olivines is limited , the fit to the 10 @xmath0 m feature improves marginally ( @xmath54 100 ) when mg@xmath55fe@xmath56sio@xmath37 is added to the mixture of dust components , indicating a slightly fe - rich composition .",
    "since the improvements are very small , and the composition is very close to a mg / fe ratio of unity , we will consider only the amorphous silicates with @xmath57 in the remainder of this analysis .    in case of the amorphous silicates , we have solved eq .",

    "the degree of crystallinity in the spectra of m supergiants is less well known , in part because most of those dust shells are optically thin and may be able to hide a large amount of crystalline silicates in a similar way as described in @xcite .",

    "better determinations of the degree of crystallinity of the silicates in stellar ejecta may yield a change in the amorphization time scale .",

    "depending on the choice of fir / submm dust emissivities it is estimated that cas a is surrounded by 2 - 4 @xmath131 of cold dust , while kepler s supernova remnant contains @xmath132 in the form of cold dust .",

    "indeed , @xcite shows that a much smaller dust mass in the form of metallic iron needles explains the same submm data points . the galactic dust production rate by sne is estimated to be @xmath133 yr@xmath90 @xcite , which is dominated by the cold dust .",
    "the authors have derived this rate by scaling the dust production rates for type ii supernovae @xcite with the dust condensation efficiency determined for cas a , assuming it had a 30 @xmath131 progenitor , and applying a supernova rate , which arises from standard values of the initial mass function and star formation rate ( l.  dunne ,  _",

    "unfortunately , the two scuba data points used for this determination do not yield any information on the composition of this cold dust component .",

    "we will not consider dilution by silicates formed in the diffuse ism . in the low density environment of the diffuse interstellar medium ,",
    "the formation of amorphous silicates from gas phase molecules is unlikely , although the high depletion of si and high grain destruction rate suggest that grain formation occurs @xcite . the observed difference in depletion between cloud- and intercloud - regions in the ism ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while the presence of crystalline silicates in circumstellar environments is well established , their presence in the dense ism remains subject to discussion .",
    "dense ism crystalline silicates were first reported to be present in orion @xcite , but the features ascribed to crystalline silicates in this work may very well be explained by a combination of a pah emission plateau , memory effects in the data and incorrect band merging ( f.  kemper ,  _ in prep . _ ) .",

    "even though there are some indications that crystalline silicates are present in dense clouds associated with young stellar objects , at most 1 - 2 % of the silicates seen in the lines - of - sight towards protostars can have a crystalline lattice structure @xcite .",

    "to date , no crystalline silicates have been found in the younger , deeply embedded class 0 objects @xcite .",
    "the lack of crystalline silicates in the diffuse interstellar medium suggests that crystalline silicates found in environments associated with star formation and dense clouds are formed or annealed locally .",
    "there might have been an exchange of crystalline silicates between dense clouds , cloud cores and circumstellar disks , but any excursion into the diffuse ism would make a crystalline silicate amorphous on a very short time scale .    in the solar system ,",
    "cometary dust particles are generally believed to be the most pristine dust particles , which survived the formation of the solar system without being processed .",
    "infrared spectroscopy of comets and laboratory analysis of cometary dust particles has revealed that comets contain a considerable fraction of crystalline silicates , usually around 30% .",
    "the remainder of the silicates is found to be amorphous ( * ? ? ? * and references herein ) .",
    "recent model calculations , however , suggest that the amount of crystalline silicates in comet hale - bopp may be significantly lower than previously assumed ( m.  min ,  _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "the crystallization of these cometary silicates must have occurred after the grain has left the diffuse interstellar medium , either in the dense molecular cloud , during the star formation process or in the solar nebula , and thus cometary grains do not represent unaltered interstellar dust . another way to study cometary dust",
    "is by collecting interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) of cometary origin in the stratosphere of the earth .",
    "both the remote observations of comets and the study of idps suggest that the crystalline fraction in comets is much larger than in the interstellar medium .",
    "that suggests perhaps whole scale recrystallization and mixing in the solar nebula has occurred , in which grains are evaporated and recondensed in the crystalline form .",
    "@xcite have studied a sample of nine anhydrous idps collected by nasa over a number of years and were able to identify 1031 individual silicate subgrains .",
    "six of these grains have non - solar oxygen isotopic compositions , indicating a presolar origin of these grains .",
    "the isotopic ratios point to formation by red supergiants or agb stars .",
    "it is important to realize that grains with an isotopic composition that resembles the solar composition may have condensed in the presolar nebula , but could also originate from the prestellar nebulae of young stellar objects in the vicinity of the solar nebula .",
    "the six grains of non - solar isotopic composition therefore only represent a lower limit to the number of presolar or interstellar grains in the sample . for three of the grains with non - solar isotopic ratios",
    "the mineralogical composition has been determined ; two of them are found to be gems grains ( glasses with embedded metals and sulfides , i.e.  amorphous silicates ; * ? ? ? * ) and one turns out to be a forsterite grain . from this one might conclude that 1/6 of the interstellar grains are crystalline , which contradicts our result .",
    "the idp study clearly suffers from small number statistics , and their result will become more significant if more data on the composition of presolar grains can be acquired .",
    "in this work , the results of a study on the crystallinity of silicates in the diffuse ism have been presented .",
    "it is known that crystalline silicates are common in the circumstellar environment of both pre- and post - main - sequence stars .",
    "it is generally accepted that the dust particles found in the circumstellar environment of young stars originate from evolved stars , and have arrived in their current location after a long ( several gyr ) residence time in the interstellar medium .",
    "the puzzling lack of evidence of crystalline silicates in the ism , prompted us to set a firm upper limit on the crystallinity .",
    "studying the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature in absorption towards sgr a@xmath1 we are able to determine that at most 0.4% of the silicates in the interstellar medium have a crystalline structure . the data are best fitted with a degree of crystallinity of 0.2% .",
    "in addition , we have determined the composition of the amorphous silicate component in the diffuse interstellar medium . we found that 84.9% of the amorphous grains are olivine ( mg@xmath44fe@xmath45sio@xmath37 ) and 15.1% are pyroxene ( mg@xmath136fe@xmath42sio@xmath43 ) .",
    "the amorphous grains were found to be spherical and smaller than @xmath39 @xmath0 m in radius .",
    "detailed analysis of the 10 @xmath0 m feature indicates that the pyroxenes are probably slightly mg - rich ( with @xmath137 ) and the interstellar olivines may be fe - rich ( with @xmath138 ) .    by comparison of these results with the crystallinity of the silicates produced by mass - losing stars , and the interstellar grain destruction rate , we have determined the interstellar amorphization rate , and found that crystalline silicates are effectively amorphitized in 5 myr to achieve a final crystallinity of 0.2% , while an amorphization time scale of 9 myr is consistent with the determined upper limit of 0.4% .",
    "these numbers are only estimates , as the crystallinity of stellar ejecta is not determined very accurately yet .",
    "amorphization by low energy ion bombardment has been explored as an explanation for the low degree of crystallinity of silicates in the ism , but the results are not yet consistent with the observed low degree of crystallinity .",
    "in addition , dilution by other sources of amorphous silicates , such as supernovae , are not sufficient to explain the observed lack of crystalline silicates in the ism .",
    "we conclude that effectively all silicates in the diffuse interstellar medium become amorphous on a very short time scale , compared to the total residence time in the diffuse ism .",
    "hence , the crystalline silicates found in the circumstellar environments of young stars , in the solar system and in star formation regions have not survived the ism unaltered , but are probably crystallized locally .",

    "<S> this is much lower than the degree of crystallinity observed in silicates in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars , the main contributors of dust to the ism . </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible explanations for this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> first , an amorphization process occurs in the ism on a time scale significantly shorter than the destruction time scale , possibly caused by particle bombardment by heavyweight ions . </S>",
    "<S> second , we consider the possibility that the crystalline silicates in stellar ejecta are diluted by an additional source of amorphous silicates , in particular supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results with a study on silicate pre - solar grains found in interplanetary dust particles . </S>"
