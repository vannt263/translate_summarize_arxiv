    "since the discovery of non - axisymmetric secular instability of rotating stars driven by gravitational radiation ( @xcite ) , its possibility to limit a rotational period of a neutron star has been pointed out by several authors . as the instability sets in at _ neutral points _ in the absence of viscosity , it would become the main issue to determine these neutral points for rapidly rotating stars in general relativity .",
    "however , thus far , only several investigations in newtonian gravity ( @xcite ) and one post - newtonian investigation ( @xcite ) have been made , because it has been very difficult to manage general relativistic perturbations of rotating stars completely .",
    "in such a situation , yoshida & kojima  ( 1997 ) have examined the accuracy of the relativistic version of the cowling approximation for oscillations of slowly rotating relativistic stars . comparing the results by the",
    "_ relativistic cowling approximation _ ( hereafter rca ; for earlier literatures , see e.g. @xcite ) with ` exact ' eigenfrequencies obtained by fully relativistic analysis , they argued that the approximation works well for slowly rotating relativistic stars .",
    "this suggests that we can determine with a fairly good accuracy the neutral points by this approximation .",
    "we here investigate the `` counter - rotating '' f - mode oscillations of rapidly rotating relativistic stellar models by the rca .",
    "though , as seen in the newtonian results ( @xcite ) , errors of f - mode eigenfrequencies are larger than those of p- or g- modes , absolute values of errors arising from the rca are likely to become smaller for _ relativistic _ and _ rotating _ stars compared to the newtonian values ( see below ) . furthermore we will estimate roughly the amount of the corrections to the results of the rca .",
    "here we investigate only _ uniformly rotating polytropic _ stars .",
    "polytropic relation is defined by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the central energy density , @xmath2 is a measure of strength of gravity of the star and other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "the stationary axisymmetric equilibrium states are obtained by the keh scheme ( komatsu , eriguchi , & hachisu 1989 ) .",
    "the space coordinates @xmath3 and the time coordinate @xmath4 are used in this paper . as a parameter characterizing the stellar rotation we adopt the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational energy @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .    in the present study ,",
    "all the eulerian perturbations of the metric components are omitted .",
    "thus our basic equations consist of ( 1 ) the perturbation equation of the baryon number conservation and ( 2 ) the perturbation equation of the energy momentum conservation .",
    "the perturbed eulerian variables are assumed to have harmonic dependences on the time and the azimuthal angular coordinate : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an integer and @xmath8 is the frequency .",
    "the boundary condition of the problem is that _ the lagrangian perturbation of the pressure vanishes at the original stellar surface_. since the basic equations closely resemble those of newtonian gravity , they are solved by the same scheme developed for the newtonian perturbations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have checked our rca code by applying it to two cases , i.e. spherical stars in general relativity and rotating stars in newtonian gravity .",
    "first our frequencies for relativistic spherical stars agree well with those of other rca calculations of yoshida & kojima  ( 1997 ) . as for rapidly rotating newtonian stars , by comparing our results with those of the newtonian cowling approximation which are obtained by the modified code of yoshida & eriguchi  ( 1995 ) , we have found that our rca code can reproduce the neutral points of f - modes with enough accuracy , i.e. within errors of 2% .      from intersection of @xmath9 curves of equilibrium sequences and @xmath10",
    "we can obtain neutral points which are tabulated in table 1 .    in the framework of newtonian gravity critical values of @xmath5 for the @xmath11 `",
    "bar ' mode have been considered to be universal , i.e. @xmath12 irrespective of compressibility and/or the rotation laws ( @xcite ) . however , even for @xmath13 polytropes we could not find a neutral point against this bar mode in weak gravity limit , i.e. for small @xmath2 .",
    "this may results from the crudeness of the cowling approximation for lower order modes . in the newtonian cowling approximation ,",
    "smaller frequencies are obtained than those calculated from the full treatment . as a consequence ,",
    "the critical values of @xmath5 at neutral points tend to be raised in this approximation .",
    "thus even if @xmath14 neutral points for the bar mode may not be reached before the termination of equilibrium sequence due to mass - shedding .",
    "on the other hand , neutral points for the bar mode could be found for stronger gravity , although the value of @xmath5 does not coincide with the newtonian universal value @xmath15 .",
    "remarkable is that even for soft equations of state ( @xmath16 ) with sufficiently strong gravity , neutral points for the bar mode do appear .",
    "this is not , however , so surprising because general relativistic effect on equilibrium states becomes significant .",
    "mode for softer equations of state with taking metric perturbations into consideration . ]",
    "our numerical computational results can be summarized as follows : ( a ) for sequences with @xmath17 and @xmath2 kept fixed , values of @xmath5 at neutral points become smaller as the value of @xmath7 increases ; ( b ) for sequences with @xmath17 and @xmath7 kept fixed , values of @xmath5 at neutral points become smaller as the value of @xmath2 increases ; ( c ) for sequences with @xmath7 and @xmath2 kept fixed , values of @xmath5 at neutral points becomes smaller as the value of @xmath17 increases .    in newtonian gravity , normalized eigenfrequency scales as : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass density at the centre",
    ", @xmath20 is the mean density of the star and @xmath21 is the zenithal quantum number . from this relation ,",
    "normalized frequencies become smaller for models with higher mass concentration toward the centre .",
    "because of strong gravity , matter distributions are concentrated towards the central region for relativistic models . in other words ,",
    "relativistic stars can be considered to become softer effectively .",
    "consequently frequencies become lower for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "before applying the rca to realistic neutron stars , it is important to note how far this approximation can be reliably applied . in particular",
    "we need to estimate how the strength of relativity and the amount of rotation affect the results .",
    "it should be noted that eigenfunctions of energy density perturbation for f - modes are peaked near the surface .",
    "it implies that surface regions are important for f - modes . on the other hand , as is known in newtonian models , relative importance of gravitational perturbations reduces as the amount of mass participating in oscillations decreases .",
    "consequently relativistic gravity can be considered to improve the approximation because the effective concentration of the matter due to relativity makes the role of metric perturbations less important .",
    "furthermore perturbed density distribution of rotating models is more sharply peaked toward the surface of the star as the stars are spun up .",
    "therefore the accuracy of the cowling approximation can be relatively increased for rotating models than spherical ones .",
    "thus these two factors can be said qualitatively to have advantages in deciding neutral points .",
    "however , since there have been no investigations on perturbations of rotating stars in full general relativity , the influence of rotation on the errors due to the rca can not be quantitatively estimated by direct comparison with the results of full calculations .",
    "thus we need some device to have quantitative estimation about the errors .",
    "our proposal is as follows .",
    "we assume that qualitative dependence of the mode on stellar rotation in general relativity is similar to that of the newtonian counterpart .",
    "in newtonian theory , differences between the eigenfrequencies obtained by the cowling approximation and those by the full analysis including gravitational perturbations decrease monotonically as stars are spun up . if this tendency is the same for general relativistic rotating stars , the maximal error of the rca in determining neutral points can be estimated .",
    "let us select one @xmath9 curve for a certain equilibrium sequence computed by the rca .",
    "since the maximum error of this curve is assumed to be that of the spherical model , the amount of the maximum error can be calculated by comparing our results with exact values of spherical models in general relativity . a parallel displacement of this @xmath22 curve by this amount of the maximum error yields a curve with the maximal error in determination of neutral points ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "since the amount of displacement required to obtain the correct eigenfrequency from the value by the cowling approximation decreases as the value of @xmath5 is increased , the ` true eigenfrequency curve ' with gravitational perturbations passes between the curves of the cowling approximation and of the curve of the maximal error defined above .",
    "therefore if the error of the eigenfrequency for the spherical model and the inclination of @xmath23 curve of the rca at the approximated neutral point are known , the maximal error in determining a neutral point will be determined by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the maximum error of the frequency .    for @xmath26 polytropes",
    "we have obtained the maximal errors of @xmath5 at neutral points for several modes ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we also display the post - newtonian values of @xmath5 at neutral points computed by cutler & lindblom ( 1992 ) .",
    "two results agree within the maximal errors estimated here except for @xmath11 modes which are not available for the post - newtonian calculations .",
    "here we have shown that the rca works rather well in evaluating eigenfrequencies of rotating stars in general relativity despite its naiveness .",
    "as eigenmode analysis in the rca is much easier than in the post - newtonian treatment , this approximation can be extensively used in determining oscillatory frequencies of realistic neutron stars and/or determining their neutral points .",
    "the main drawback of this approximation is that it is hard to include the effect of gravitational radiation which is responsible for damping or growing of corresponding modes .",
    "the post - newtonian treatment can , in principle , systematically include this effect by increasing further the order of approximation .",
    "in contrast the rca in itself can not include its effect consistently .",
    "some modification such as an estimation of effective damping due to gravitational radiation by using eigenfunctions obtained by the rca may be needed .",
