    "the term `` monism '' ( monistic ) in its application to geometry means , that the conception of a geometry uses only one fundamental quantity ( distance ) and all other geometrical quantities and concepts are derivatives of the fundamental quantity .",
    "the pluralistic conception is a conception , containing several fundamental quantities , which may be independent . in general , a monistic conception can be considered as a pluralistic conception .",
    "it is sufficient to declare , that some derivative quantities of monistic conception are fundamental quantities of a pluralistic conception .",
    "however , not any pluralistic conception can be considered as a monistic conception .",
    "it is necessary for such a consideration , that there are proper connections between fundamental quantities of the pluralistic conception .",
    "if one is going to modify or to generalize a conception , it is desirable to present the conception in the form of a monistic conception . in this case",
    "it is sufficient to modify properties of the only fundamental quantity .",
    "other ( derivative ) quantities will be modified automatically , because other quantities are functions of the unique fundamental quantity .",
    "if the modified conception is pluralistic , the modification becomes to be difficult , because in the pluralistic conception there may be connections between the fundamental quantities . in this case one may not modify independently properties of different fundamental quantities , which look as independent .",
    "usually the monistic conception is a more developed conception , than the foregoing pluralistic conception , containing several fundamental quantities .",
    "for instance , the christianity , which contains only one god , is a more developed conception , than the heathendom , which contains many gods .",
    "usually a monistic conception ( or a less pluralistic conception ) is a result of development of a pluralistic conception , which is followed by a reduction of fundamental quantities .",
    "for instance , theory of thermal phenomena developed from the axiomatic thermodynamics to the statistical physics .",
    "this development was followed by transformation of fundamental thermodynamic quantities into derivative quantities of the statistical physics .",
    "appearance of intermediate derivative concepts of the monistic conception makes the monistic conception to be a more complicated conception , than the preceding pluralistic conception .",
    "this complexity is conditioned by a necessity of deduction of transformed quantities , which were fundamental quantities in the pluralistic conception .",
    "however , the more complicated monistic conception admits one to describe and explain such physical phenomena , which can not be described in the framework of the pluralistic theory .",

    "attempts @xcite were made to construct so called distance geometry , which is free of the condition ( [ a1.10 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , these attempts failed in the sense , that the obtained distance geometry was not monistic and completely metric .",

    "it is reasonable to use the definition ( [ a1.16 ] ) in other geometries , and in particular , in the riemannian geometry . in the riemannian geometry one uses the definition ( [ a1.16 ] ) only for the case , when the points @xmath50 and @xmath68 coincide  ( @xmath80 ) . in this case",

    "if in inhomogeneous geometry ( in the riemannian geometry ) the two vectors equivalence is defined by the relations ( a1.16 ) , the vector equivalence appears to be multivariant , in general .",
    "it means , that in the point @xmath68 there are many vectors @xmath81 , which are equivalent to the vector @xmath58 and are not equivalent between themselves .",
    "multivariance is a corollary of the fact , that to determinate the vector @xmath59 , one needs to solve two equations ( [ a1.16 ] ) with respect to the point @xmath82 at given points @xmath83 . in the case of the euclidean world function",
    "@xmath13 the solution is always unique due to properties of the euclidean world function @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the case of arbitrary world function @xmath10 there may be many solutions , or may be no solutions at all .",
    "multivariance of the vectors equality leads to intransitivity of the equality relation .",
    "it means , that a multivariant geometry is nonaxiomatizable , because in any axiomatizable geometry the equality relation is transitive . in general , multivariance of the equality relation",
    "leads to the fact that the straight lines appear to be not a one - dimensional sets .",
    "it follows from the fact that the condition of parallelism ( [ b2.10 ] ) is one of conditions of the vectors equivalence ( [ a1.16 ] ) .",
    "the parallelism condition ( [ b2.10 ] ) is a special case of the collinearity condition ( [ b2.2 ] ) .",
    "thus , there is a connection between the multivariance and many - dimensionality of straight lines in multivariant geometry .",
    "multivariant nonaxiomatizable geometry seems to be inadmissible for mathematicians , who are used to consider only axiomatizable geometries .",
    "the mathematicians consider any geometry as a logical construction , and they do not know , how to work with a geometry , which is not a logical construction .    in the riemannian geometry the multivariance of the equality of two vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 takes place , in general , only if @xmath84 . the vectors @xmath58 and @xmath85 equality is single - variant in the riemannian geometry . as a result segments ( [ a1.12])@xmath16of geodesics ( straights ) in the riemannian geometry appear to be one - dimensional .",
    "only straights of the form ( [ b2.5 ] ) appear to be many - dimensional in the riemannian geometry .",
    "however , such straight lines appear practically neither in physics , nor in mathematics , and mathematicians relate with disbelief to the statement on multivariance of a geometry .    using the pluralistic approach in the transition from the proper euclidean geometry to the riemannian geometry , one thinks , that the one - dimensional character of straights in the euclidean geometry is a property of any geometry . however , this property is a special property of the proper euclidean geometry , which is conditioned by the relations ( [ a1.2 ] ) - ( [ a1.9 ] ) . in the riemannian geometry",

    "( as a result essentially the equivalence of two vectors at different points appears to be multivariant ) .",
    "such a solution of the vector equivalence problem corresponds to the pluralistic approach to geometry , when in the riemannian geometry one may change properties of vectors in arbitrary way . as a result",
    "the riemannian geometry appears to be inconsistent , although this inconsistency is well masked .    at the pluralistic approach to the riemannian geometry",
    "the world function @xmath55 , defined by the relation ( [ a1.12 ] ) , appears to be derivative quantity , which depends on the shape of geodesics . besides , in the riemannian geometry there may be several different geodesics , connecting points @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this case",

    "the monistic conception of geometry is essential also in the megacosm .",
    "the contemporary general relativity theory supposes , that the space - time geometry can not be a nonaxiomatizable geometry ( a non - riemannian geometry ) .",

    ", for mathematicians a geometry is rather a logical construction , than a science on disposition of geometrical objects in the space , or in the space - time .",
    "apparently , such a relation to geometry is a reason of abruption of constructive ( nonaxiomatizable ) geometries , which are very important in application of a geometry to physics .",

    "after several months ( end of 2005 ) after publishing the paper @xcite , perelman left the mathematical institute , where he worked , and said to director of the institute , that he ceases his mathematical research .",
    "such a decision of the prosperous geometer can be explained only by a strong disappointment in his activity . during all",
    "his life perelman developed topological direction in geometry , where topological quantities are the fundamental quantities of geometry . when he has understood , that the topological quantities are derivative quantities , which are determined by the world function , and the riemannian geometry , which has been used in his investigations , is inconsistent , he was shocked",
    "apparently , this shock determines his decision on termination of his mathematical investigations .    as concerns to his refuse from the fields medal and from award of the clay mathematics institute , it is important only from the viewpoint of mercantile grassroots , who seek material values instead of human . from viewpoint of perelman",

    "indeed , one can understand behavior of perelman , only if one does know about the riemannian geometry inconsistency . but nobody pay attention onto this inconsistency , even if one knows about signs of this inconsistency .",

    "my interpretation of the perelman s behaviour is only a hypothesis .",
    "however , it is a very verisimilar hypothesis .",
    "i do not now other reasonable hypothesis , which could explain the perelman s behaviour .",
    "i have presented this hypothesis , to convince those researchers , who believe rather in authorities , than in logical arguments .",
    "the riemannian geometry in its conventional presentation is inconsistent , even if my interpretation of the perelman s behaviour is wrong .",
    "thus , the relation of researchers to the monistic conception of geometry develops in its natural way .",
    "i think , that those researchers , who have understood advantages of the monistic conception of geometry and will use it in their investigations , will succeed in progress of physics ."
