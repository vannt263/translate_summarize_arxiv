    "( [ eq : pareos ] ) determines the symmetry energy changes , i.e. , how asy - stiff or asy - soft the eos is .",
    "the value of @xmath135 , used so far , represents a asy - soft system @xcite . above saturation density",
    "we change the value of this parameter and use @xmath136 while keeping all other parameters fixed representing a asy - stiff system .",
    "the effect of the @xmath134 modification is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2r ] .    only small changes in the mass - radius relation",
    "are obtained when hyperons are included . in most cases",
    "the mass difference is @xmath137 .",
    "an increasing @xmath134 leads to an increase in the proton concentration which in turn leads to an increase in the @xmath3 concentration .",
    "this largely cancels any energy gain from an increased symmetry energy term that could possibly increase the mass of a neutron star .",
    "the biggest mass change is seen for @xmath86 mev with the @xmath117eft600 interaction since this model does not contain any @xmath3 hyperons .",
    "however , even in this case the difference is below @xmath138 which leads to a maximum mass below @xmath139 .",
    "a more noticeable change can be observed for the radius .",
    "a radius shift of 1 km towards larger radii is seen for all curves .",
    "furthermore , if we in addition vary @xmath79 at saturation density between 28 and 36 mev , a less pronounced effect on the ns mass is visible as compared to the variation of @xmath134 .    to complete our investigation of hyperon effects on the neutron star eos",
    "we also need to consider modifications induced by the @xmath7 and @xmath140 interactions . in order to evaluate the effects of the @xmath141 sector we have to construct @xmath7 and @xmath140 @xmath142 interactions , along the lines discussed earlier for the @xmath1 sector .",
    "obviously , since there are more particles to consider , the situation complicates considerably from a numerical point of view .",
    "unfortunately , unlike the @xmath1 sector where we had several different `` bare '' interactions from which we constructed the @xmath8 potentials , in the @xmath141 sector we only have one , namely the nsc97 interaction .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of the @xmath141 sector will not influence the appearance of the first hyperon .",
    "hence we have neglected the @xmath141 up to this point .",
    "[ fig : myyr ] shows the mass - radius relation of a ns with different @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath140 interactions is presented .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of the @xmath141 sector is rather marginal . as is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : myyr ] the maximum masses are lower than in the previous cases which is reasonable since a further degree of freedom , the @xmath143 particle , is added .",
    "however we note that the @xmath144 @xmath7 interaction is attractive which is the reason for the decrease of the allowed maximum ns masses , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a repulsive @xmath7 interaction would have an opposite effect as shown in @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that for the @xmath117eft600 interaction , where the @xmath3 hyperons appears late , if at all , it is the @xmath143 hyperons which takes its pace and influences the maximum mass of a ns @xcite . for all other models in which the @xmath3 appears earlier than the @xmath143",
    "their influence on the ns mass is marginal .",
    "the main intention of the present work was to study the consequences of available hyperon - nucleon interactions on the composition of neutrons stars and the maximum masses .",
    "the analysis was performed in the framework of the renormalisation group improved @xmath8 interaction deduced from available bare potentials . since the experimental data base is very limited ,",
    "these potentials are not well constrained , in contrast to the nucleon - nucleon case .",
    "we have determined the threshold densities for the appearence of hyperons in @xmath0-equilibrated neutron star matter to lowest order in a loop expansion . to explore the sensitivity to available @xmath6 potentials we have constructed single - particle potentials for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 hyperon in lowest order and deduced the energy per particle .",
    "we have replaced the pure nucleonic contribution to the energy per particle by an analytic parameterization .",
    "this replacement enables us to vary the incompressibility @xmath78 and symmetry energy @xmath79 of the purely nucleonic eos and to investigate their influence on the threshold densities of hyperons .",
    "the composition of @xmath0-stable matter has been determined by the requirement of charge neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "the corresponding threshold densities for various values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 were evaluated .",
    "the most important conclusion is that a more attractive single - particle potential will decrease the chemical potential and thus decrease the threshold density of the corresponding hyperon .",
    "we have found that , irrespective of the @xmath6 interactions , incompressibility and symmetry parameter used , hyperons will appear in dense neutron star matter at densities around @xmath130 .",
    "this inevitably leads to a significant softening of the eos which in turn results in smaller maximum masses of a neutron star compared to a purely nucleonic eos .",
    "notably , the predicted maximum masses are well below the observed value of @xmath145 , an outcome also known from other works , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this poses a serious problem .",
    "the softening of the eos due to hyperons can not be circumvented by stiffening the nucleonic eos , i.e. , by increasing @xmath78 , since this will cause hyperons to appear earlier .",
    "changing the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy dependence or including the @xmath141 sector does not alter this conclusion either .",
    "for more details about the @xmath141 sector , in particular @xmath143 hyperons in dense baryonic matter see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this can only mean , that correlations beyond the one - loop level could be important to stiffen the hyperon contributions to the eos .",
    "this , however , is not sufficient as brueckner - hartree - fock calculations indicate @xcite . as has been known for a long time from non - relativistic nuclear many - body theory , three - body interactions are crucial to yield a stiff nucleonic eos .",
    "repulsive three - body forces may also play a role in the hyperon sector .",
    "there is , however , little empirical information available at present .",
    "there is also the possibility of an early onset of quark - hadron transition to cold quark matter .",
    "this might also stiffen the high - density equation of state .",
    "clearly , our results pose significant restrictions on any reasonable equations of state employed in the study of neutron star matter . with the prediction of a low onset of hyperon appearance it becomes mandatory to seriously consider strangeness with respect to neutron stars .",
    "eventhough our predictions for the maximum masses of neutron stars are too low , the treatment of hyperons in neutron stars is necessary and any approach to dense matter must address this issue .",
