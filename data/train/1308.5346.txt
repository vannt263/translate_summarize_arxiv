    "the existence of some mysterious component of the universe , namely the dark matter ( dm ) , has been solidified by multiple astrophysical and cosmological observations .",
    "the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is one popular candidate of dm .",
    "recently various underground direct detection experiments such as dama  @xcite , cogent  @xcite , cresst  @xcite and cdms  @xcite have shown some dm - like events in the low mass region .",
    "although there is still no conclusive statement for the existence of wimp based on these events , it is worth paying special attention to the light wimp considering undergoing searches in low mass region .    since there is no viable wimp candidates in the standard model ( sm ) , extensions of this highly successful theory is necessary .",
    "one simple extension of the sm is to add a real sm gauge singlet with a mass of the electroweak scale or less  @xcite .",
    "an unbroken @xmath0 parity , under which only the singlet is odd , stabilizes this particle ( called @xmath1 here ) .    at the renormalizable level the singlet only couples to the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the coupling has to be carefully adjusted to reproduce the required relic density of @xmath1 , while satisfying the constraints from the indirect and direct searches  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , a hard task to accomplish within the sm+d framework , taking into account the results from the direction detection of dm and the search for invisible decay mode of sm higgs at the lhc . for recent discussions ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in order to achieve a consistent scenario with singlet dark matter , it is desirable to consider an extension of the sm , such as the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) that we discuss here  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the thdm+d framework , with singlet mass @xmath2 gev , in light of the implications of the lhc higgs search results for the type ii thdm . to accommodate the sm higgs search data ,",
    "the coupling between the singlet and the sm - like higgs is forbidden by hand and dm @xmath1 can only be produced in pairs via the non - sm higgs boson .",
    "in particular the isospin - violating effect introduced to reconcile the experiments above and xenon100 is discussed  @xcite , in terms of the allowed parameter region in type ii thdm .",
    "we investigate three candidates of real singlet field , namely scalar , majorana fermion and vector .",

    "the size of the couplings @xmath19 controls the signal strength of the dm detection and is determined by the constraints from dm relic density measurement and the implication of sm higgs searches for thdm at lhc .    in the type ii thdm , the interactions between two cp - even higgses and massive gauge bosons follow the same behavior as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) : @xmath20 where sm - like higgs is the one which couples to the gauge bosons more strongly .",
    "current studies of the lhc data and the type ii thdm imply the existence of two scenarios  @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 in both cases . unlike the mssm , in type ii thdm , the masses of @xmath23 are largely uncorrelated . in order to simplify the non - sm higgs decay modes for concreteness",
