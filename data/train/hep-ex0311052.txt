    "kaons , being the minimal `` flavour laboratory '' , always had a leading rle in the discovery and the study of fundamental physics issues which are related to flavour changing transitions induced by weak interactions .",
    "their success as a physics probe is partly due to the mixed blessing of their relatively small mass ( on the hadronic scale ) , and its experimental consequences .    along the history from the discovery of cp violation @xcite to the evidence of direct cp violation @xcite @xcite the peculiar system of neutral kaons was central , while charged kaons were deeply exploited for the search of very rare processes probing high energy scales @xcite .",
    "the level of sensitivity at which rare kaon decay searches have been pushed is rather remarkable : several branching ratios at the @xmath1 level have been measured ( not to mention the smallest branching ratio ever measured , @xmath2 ) , and limits down to @xmath3 are available @xcite .    today",
    ", great efforts are dedicated to testing the standard model by over - constraining the ckm mixing matrix , and it should be noted that also in this respect kaon decays might offer a very powerful probe , complementary and in some cases even superior to the one represented by @xmath4 mesons @xcite , for the decays which can be reliably described by the theory .",
    "we do not know where new physics will show up first , and even relatively well measured parameters such as the cabibbo angle might reserve some surprise @xcite , so that more refined measurements of several kaon decays are now of great interest .    for what concerns",
    "cp violation searches , it should be noted that so far the only evidence of this phenomenon in nature arises from somewhat subtle effects involving coupled neutral states . while after the discovery of direct cp violation we have no reason to doubt that cp asymmetries should be present also in charged particle decays , as predicted by our current paradigm for describing cp violation , such asymmetries - which would be indeed the simplest manifestations of cp violation from a conceptual point of view and entirely due to direct cp violation - have yet to be detected ( although admittedly we might be close to this ) .",
    "t - odd correlations , being actively probed in charged k decays through polarization measurements , are also a complementary window on new physics through cp violation ( also t violation has only been detected in the state mixing of neutral kaons so far ) .",
    "one should also mention that precise kaon decay data is needed to further constrain the parameters of the effective theory we use to describe low - energy physics , namely chiral perturbation theory , and that measurements of branching ratios and decay form factors can offer stringent tests of anomalous couplings and universality .",
    "several experiments were devoted to searches for lepton flavour number violation ( lfv ) by searching for rare decays of charged kaons .",
    "these measurements allowed to dismiss several models of new physics thanks to their sensitivity to very high mass scales , and represent nowadays an important constraint to models of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the results achieved by several dedicated experiments , lately mainly by bnl experiment e865 , are rather impressive ( see table [ tab : lfv ] ) .",
    "the low limits reached make further progress difficult : kaon flux and physical backgrounds are the limiting factors , and no new dedicated experiments on lfv with kaons are in preparation at this time .",
    ".present limits on lfv charged kaon decays @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : world ]    among new facilities , one where a strong kaon physics program is foreseen is the j - parc 50 gev proton synchrotron in construction at tokai in japan @xcite .",
    "this high - intensity machine ( @xmath5 p/3.4 s ) is expected to deliver beam to experiments in 2008 .",
    "two beam lines are foreseen in the experimental hall ( only one at startup ) , one of which with a low energy ( @xmath6 600 mev/@xmath7 ) separated @xmath8 beam ( @xmath9 @xmath8/s ) .",
    "several letters of intent for charged kaon experiments have been submitted , including : an improved transverse muon polarization experiment to reach @xmath10 sensitivity , an extensive program for the complete measurement of @xmath8 decay modes , a dedicated @xmath11 branching ratio measurement , studies of pionium and @xmath12 atoms , and a @xmath13 measurement .",
    "one can question which of these measurements will remain central in kaon physics by 2008 , and the answer clearly depends also on the success of the ongoing experimental efforts .    considering the availability of charged kaons in the world , one is led to the picture depicted in table [ tab : world ] ; the sheer amount and quality of the ongoing and future activities , including the ones which were discussed at this workshop involving upgrades of existing machines and/or experiments , clearly indicate how the field is a very active one .    playing the seer , one could guess the following possible scenario concerning physics with charged kaons at a time where the lhc is starting : all large branching ratios of the charged kaon will be known with high accuracy , with the universality tests which they imply , and including a consistent value of @xmath14 from the kaon sector ; some cp - violating charge asymmetries will be measured at the @xmath15 level ( and several others at @xmath16 ) , chiral perturbation theory predictions for several rare decays will be put under stringent test , and the experimental results will be closer to the theoretical precision in @xmath17 scattering lengths .",
    "after the impressive success of the first cp violation studies with @xmath4 mesons in recent years , also this heavier system is now reaching the stage in which challenging precision measurements are needed , requiring high statistics and a detailed understanding of several hard theoretical issues .",
    "it seems therefore worthy to look again with renewed interest at the relative advantages of experiments with kaons , which can offer an alternative and complementary view on some deep unanswered questions of physics .",
