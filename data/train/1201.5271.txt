    "the importance of exact solutions for 2d - euler equations is well known .",
    "today , the list of exact solutions is quite impressive . without pretending to be exhaustive",
    "we will mention only some of them .",
    "first of all , this are classical solutions with smooth vorticity , such as rankine and kirchhoff type vortices ( see , for example , the standard references @xcite- @xcite ) , elliptical moore and suffman vortices.@xcite , lamb dipole @xcite and stuart vortex pattern @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , that these classical solutions are still topical ( see for example recent works @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the generalization of these solutions are the models of different coherent structures , vortex patches , and vortex crystals ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) , which are well observed in numerical and laboratory experiments ( see , for example,@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "let us note that stuart solution is based on the equation of liouville type for stream function .",
    "others classes of exact solutions rest upon the equation of sinh - poisson type for the stream function @xcite- @xcite .",
    "some exact solutions in lagrange coordinates are given on the work @xcite .",
    "it should be noted the interesting class of kida -neu vortices @xcite,@xcite . also there is a lot of solutions with singular distribution of vorticity ( see .",
    "@xcite ) , and solutions , which contain a smooth part of vorticity field as well as point singularities @xcite- @xcite , which are usually forming symmetrical configurations .",
    "numerous publications deal with particular cases of point vortices ( main references can be found in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and in works @xcite- @xcite ) .",
    "it is known , that point vortices generate integrable dynamical systems as well as dynamical systems with chaotical behavior ( see , for example,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the case of a couple of point vortices , which vorticities are ofsame magnitude but opposite signs arouses particular interest .",
    "such point vortices couples are usually called point dipoles .",
    "many works are dedicated to the dynamics and statistic of point dipoles of this type ( see , for example,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite- @xcite . ) such point dipoles attract interest , especially in the theory of equations charney - hasegava - mima for atmosphere and plasma .",
    "it means solutions of modon type @xcite and its models obtained with the help of dipole structures ( see , for example,@xcite- @xcite ) .",
    "such a point dipole has two elliptical singular points ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . however , there are also 2d - point dipoles , which have different structure .",
    "they have one complex singular point which has the vector field index @xmath1 this type of point dipoles appears naturally as a consequence of expansion of stream function @xmath2 in multipoles moments , similar to usual electrodynamics .",
    "more precisely , we suppose , that the vorticity @xmath3 is localized in the restricted neighborhood @xmath4  of the  point @xmath5 , which belongs to 2d - plane .",
    "let us denote the  characteristic scale of  domain @xmath4 by @xmath6 , i.e.@xmath7 then the stream function @xmath8 :     +    @xmath9    in the domain @xmath10we can expand , as usual , in multipoles moments :    @xmath11    here , the first term is obviously point vortex with the vorticity strength @xmath12 the second term is the dipole @xmath13",
    "@xmath14    with dipole moment @xmath15 further , we will call this dipole by dipole singularity to avoid any confusion with point dipole which is composed of two point vortices .",
    "it is easy to see the difference between them when calculating the vorticity .",
    "apparently , the vorticity of vortices couple is proportional to the difference of two @xmath16functions , whereas the vorticity of dipole singularity is proportional to derivative of @xmath17function :    @xmath18,\\ ] ]    however , if the parameter @xmath19 is considered as minor , but final ,    @xmath20,\\ ] ]    then such a couple of closely located point vortices with the opposite vorticity may be considered as a approximative model of dipole singularity .",
    "the important role of dipole singularities in dynamic of 2d - euler equation was mentioned in the paper @xcite .",
    "it is shown in this paper , that point dipole singularities are moving singularities of 2d- euler equation which are forming together with point vortices the hamiltonian system of singulaties motion equation .",
    "this dynamical system has three independent integrals of motion in involution of kirchhoff type .",
    "this fact means the complete integrability of the problem of motion of one dipole singularity and of one point vortex .",
    "corresponding  exact solutions for the plane case without boundaries are given in the paper @xcite . as it was noted earlier , the dipole singularity is more complex than point vortex since the index of its vector field is equal to two ( unlike simple singularities , which index is equal to @xmath21 ) .",
    "in this paper we will continue the studies of solutions for  2d - euler equation with complex singularities , which were started in @xcite , @xcite . also , we discuss in details some questions which previously were presented briefly .",
    "further , we demonstrate , that more complex multipole singularities , generally speaking , are not compatible with the dynamic of 2d- euler equation . but",
    "in this work we show that 2d - euler equation has a new class of exact stationary solutions with complex singular point , which index is equal to three .",
    "these solutions are found in explicit form and expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "obtained solutions describe localized vortex structures , in which complex singular point is surrounded by vortices satellites .",
    "in addition we discuss the equation of motion for singularities and we give the sufficient conditions of immobility for singular points ; without this equation one can not guarantee the stationarity of solution .",
    "we use 2d euler equation in form of poisson brackets for the vorticity @xmath3 and the stream function @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    or in the form :    @xmath25    here @xmath26- is fluid velocity .",
    "poisson brackets has the usual form :    @xmath27    @xmath28is single anti symmetrical tensor :    @xmath29    @xmath30 velocity field @xmath31 is written in the form :    @xmath32    as a stationary solutions for the euler equation ( [ 2 ] ) one use often the _ anzatz : _    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is arbitrary enough differential function of @xmath35 for example , for the lamb solution @xcite , @xmath34 is chosen as a linear function , for the stuart solution @xcite @xmath36 and for solutions @xcite @xmath37 .    in solutions of type ( [ 5 ] )",
    "the vorticity @xmath3 is smooth enough function .",
    "there are also stationary solutions in which the vorticity has a smooth part as well as one dimensional immobile singularities of point vortex type ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite ) .    in order to find stationary solutions for euler equation ( [ 2 ] ) with singularities of point vortex type",
    "it was proposed in the work @xcite the _ anzatz : _",
    "@xmath38    for the simplest case exact stationary solutions were found independently and in a different way in papers @xcite , @xcite . in this work",
    "we study a more general _ anzatz .",
    "_ let us suppose that the vorticity _ _  _ _ @xmath39 can be presented in the form :    @xmath40    in the expansion ( [ 9 ] ) the coordinates of singularities @xmath41 and coefficients @xmath42 may depend on time .",
    "then it is supposed that vorticity is composed of smooth part and singular part as well , which is a generalized function .",
    "to begin , let us consider physical sense of development ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "first term in right part is obviously a smooth part of vorticity field .",
    "second group of terms is vorticity , which is generated by the set of point vortices @xmath43 , with stream function @xmath44 :    @xmath45    the third group of terms in development ( [ 9 ] ) with first derivatives of @xmath46 - function describes the vorticity which is generated by group of  dipole singularities @xmath47 :    @xmath48    actually , the let us apply the operator    @xmath49    to laplace equation :    @xmath50    it is obvious that :    @xmath51    that is why the vorticity which is generated by the third group of terms has the stream function @xmath52    @xmath53    i.e.that is the sum @xmath47 stream functions of dipole singularities in the form :    @xmath54    which are in the points @xmath55 and have dipole moments @xmath56 .",
    "the velocity field of dipole singularity has evidently the form :    @xmath57 , \\ ] ]    @xmath58 .\\ ] ]    the presence of complementary sources of vorticity in form of derivatives of @xmath59 - function , itself , is not forbidden in ( [ 9 ] ) , if they are compatible with euler equation ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we have to remind  that the singularity part of vorticity like every generalized function with point support is composed of @xmath17 function sum and its derivatives only .",
    "however , in the next chapter we show that the condition of compatibility of development ( [ 9 ] ) with euler equation is not trivial and engenders important restrictions for ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "formulae which one needs to work with derivatives of generalized functions are well known , but for reader s convenience we gave them in the appendix .  before studying the general expansion of vorticity ( [ 9 ] )",
    "let us examine  some particular cases .",
    "we begin with trivial solution , which is describing  one point vortex .",
    "let us remind , how from point of view of generalized functions theory , point vortex satisfies formally euler equation .",
    "we will substitute vorticity and stream function of point vortex which are in point @xmath60 in poisson brackets .",
    "then we obtain :    @xmath61\\delta ^{^{\\prime } } ( y)-\\frac{\\gamma ^{2}}{2\\pi ( x^{2}+y^{2})}[% y\\delta ( y)]\\delta ^{^{\\prime } } ( x )   \\label{16}\\ ] ]    this poisson brackets is equal to zero since the terms in brackets are equal to zero from the generalized function theory point of view . the fact that poisson brackets is equal to zero ( [ 16 ] )",
    "is physically interpreted as absence of self - interaction in point vortex.if the poisson bracket does not vanish for the solution with one singularity on the plane , then , typically , a self acceleration of this singularity appears .",
    "this effect is considered unacceptable from a physical point of view and the corresponding solutions must be rejected .",
    "let us examine in the same way one dipole singularity , which is in the point @xmath62 and has the dipole moment @xmath63    the poisson brackets ( [ 2 ] ) for one dipole singularity gets the form :    @xmath64    let us show that poisson brackets ( [ 17 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "we substitute in ( [ 17 ] ) derivatives in explicit form and calculate it in details :    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67 - 2d_{2}(x - x_{0})(y - y_{0})}{\\left| \\overrightarrow{x}-\\overrightarrow{x}_{0}\\right| ^{4 } } ,   \\label{20}\\ ] ]    @xmath68 - 2d_{1}(x - x_{0})(y - y_{0})}{\\left| \\overrightarrow{x}-\\overrightarrow{x}_{0}\\right| ^{4}}.   \\label{21}\\ ] ]    as a result we obtain :    @xmath69\\delta _ { x}^{^{\\prime } } ( x - x_{0})-   \\label{22}\\ ] ]    @xmath70\\delta _ { y}^{^{\\prime } } ( y - y_{0})+\\ ] ]    @xmath71 - 2d_{2}^{2}(x - x_{0})(y - y_{0})}{% \\left| \\overrightarrow{x}-\\overrightarrow{x}_{0}\\right| ^{4}}\\delta ( x - x_{0})\\delta _ { yy}^{^{\\prime \\prime } } ( y - y_{0})-\\ ] ]    @xmath72 - 2d_{1}^{2}(x - x_{0})(y - y_{0})}{% \\left| \\overrightarrow{x}-\\overrightarrow{x}_{0}\\right| ^{4}}\\delta ( y - y_{0})\\delta _ { xx}^{^{\\prime \\prime } } ( x - x_{0}).\\ ] ]    let us use formulae from the appendix .",
    "action of first derivative of @xmath73function on usual functions is given by formula ( [ a.2 ] ) .",
    "it follows from this formula that the first and second terms in formula ( [ 22 ] ) are zero , since they contain zeros of the following form :    @xmath74    @xmath75    besides , in third and fourth terms the term with the factor @xmath76 turns into zero because it contains zeros @xmath77 , and the term with the factor @xmath78 turns into zero in the same way , because it contains zero @xmath79 in addition , it is evident that the terms : @xmath80\\delta _ { yy}^{^{\\prime \\prime } } ( y - y_{0})$ ] and    @xmath81\\delta _ { xx}^{^{\\prime \\prime } } ( x - x_{0})$ ] are equal to zero .",
    "consequently the brackets ( [ 22 ] ) is equal to :    @xmath82    @xmath83    now , for computing this equation we use the formula ( [ a.4 ] ) , which is needed to apply the second derivative of @xmath73function in the commutator ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that all the terms turn into zero , excluding terms without derivatives of @xmath17function , which are mutually eliminated :    @xmath84    thereby we proved that there is no self - interaction in dipole singularity and , consequently , it is the exact stationary solution of euler equation .",
    "we can also understand the absence of self - interaction in dipole singularity basing on simple physical considerations . actually , from ( fig.[fig2 ] )",
    "one can see , that due to symmetry of stream line configuration , the flux of impulse which is flowing in singularity through arbitrary section @xmath85 is exactly equal to impulse flux which is flowing out from singularity through the same symmetrical section @xmath85 .",
    "that means that the force which is acting on singularity is equal to zero and the singularity does not move .",
    "+    naturally the question arises : do the higher multipole singularities , for example , quadruple , self - interaction ? to answer this question we have to calculate poisson brackets @xmath86 for  quadruple singularity .",
    "the quadruple singularity has the stream function :    @xmath87    and the vorticity :    @xmath88    when computing the poisson brackets @xmath89 using the formula ( [ a.4.1 ] )  we obtain the following result :    @xmath90    which shows that there is self - interaction in the general case in quadruple singularity ; ( exception to the rule is special choice of coefficients : @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) .",
    "the self - interaction means that the given singularity is not physical .",
    "the similar result is obtained for multipoles of higher orders .",
    "therefore , in general case the multipoles singularities of orders higher than dipole are not compatible with euler equation .",
    "according to the work @xcite let us examine the question in which cases vorticity expansion ( [ 9 ] ) is compatible with euler equation ( [ 2 ] ) and which restrictions arise from it  for stationary and not stationary cases .",
    "we consider singularities coordinates @xmath93 and all coefficients @xmath94 for general case as depending on time .",
    "further , we will distinguish two cases : @xmath95 let us first examine the first case @xmath96 in this case the smooth part of vorticity is absent and the stream function @xmath2 is determined by singularities only    @xmath97    and derivatives of vorticity @xmath98 obviously have the form :    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    where @xmath102 - is fluid velocity ( [ 4 ] ) , which can be written down in the following form :    @xmath103 .",
    "\\label{27}\\ ] ]    we substitute ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) in euler equation([3 ] ) , and we obtain :    @xmath104 + \\label{28}\\ ] ]    @xmath105=0.\\ ] ]    since equations for different singularities @xmath106 must go to zero independently , we obtain :    @xmath104=0 , \\label{29}\\ ] ]    @xmath107=0 . \\label{30}\\ ] ]    every equation ( [ 29]),([30 ] ) contains also singularities of different orders ( @xmath17functions and derivatives of @xmath17 function ) . to satisfy each of equation ( [ 29 ] ) , ( [ 30 ] ) the factors of singularities of different orders shall also go to zero independently .",
    "let us begin with the simplest equation ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "the derivative of @xmath17function acts on velocity field @xmath26 according to formula ( [ a.2 ] ) . because of non compressibility condition @xmath108 the third term in formula ( [ 29 ] )",
    "does not give additional contributions to singularities with @xmath17functions .",
    "that is why when factors of @xmath17functions are going to zero this gives the well known equation :    @xmath109    i.e. conservation of vorticity strength .",
    "terms with the first derivatives from @xmath17function give :    @xmath110    i.e. point vortices motion equations :    @xmath111    ( in equations ( [ 32 ] ) there are no terms with self - interaction ) .",
    "let us examine now equations for point dipoles ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "the third term in equation ( [ 30 ] ) contains second derivatives from @xmath17function .",
    "these derivatives act on velocity field @xmath112 according to formula ( [ a.4 ] ) in appendix , and give the first ones and second ones as well . since derivatives of different orders must be set equal to zero independently , the equation ( [ 30 ] ) splits into two groups of equations :    @xmath113    @xmath114    equations ( [ 33]),([34 ] ) are satisfied , if all factors of different singularities turn into zero independently and the number of equations coincides with the number of variables .",
    "terms of point dipole with self - interaction as this was shown in previous chapter are absent .",
    "as a result we obtain motion equation of point dipoles :    @xmath115    @xmath116    from ( [ 33]),([34 ] ) follows that if all dipole moments are equal to zero , @xmath117 , then equations ( [ 33]),([34 ] ) are absent and only the system of equation ( [ 32 ] ) remains for point vortices motion . and vice versa , one can see from equation ( [ 31 ] ) that if all @xmath118 then the system ( [ 31 ] ) is absent and only motion equations of point dipoles remain .",
    "for the general case the equation system ( [ 32]),([35]),([36 ] ) , where the velocity has the form ( [ 27 ] ) , describes motion of point vortices @xmath43 as well as motion of point dipoles @xmath47 .",
    "this equation system was obtained for the first time in @xcite , where , in particular , was shown , that it can be written down in the hamiltonian form .",
    "further , to write down the equation system of singularities motion , we denote coordinates of point vortices as @xmath119 ( where @xmath120 is the number of point vortex @xmath121 , index @xmath122 takes the values @xmath123 i.e.denotes the coordinates of point vortex @xmath124 , @xmath125the subscript @xmath126  means the vortex coordinates ) . in similar manner we denote the coordinates of dipole singularities as @xmath127 @xmath128where @xmath129is the number of dipole singularity @xmath130 then , motion equation of singularities ( [ 32]),([35]),([36 ] ) , taking into account formula ( [ 27 ] ) for fluid velocity , takes the form of : @xmath131    @xmath132=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath133    @xmath134,\\ ] ]    @xmath135    @xmath136    @xmath137.\\ ] ]    equations ( [ 36.1 ] ) , ( [ 36.2 ] ) describe the motion of point vortices and dipole singularities as well and equation ( [ 36.3 ] ) describes time evolution of dipole moment . as this",
    "is shown in work @xcite these equations have the hamiltonian form :    @xmath138    @xmath139    @xmath140    here hamiltonian @xmath141 has the form :    @xmath142    @xmath143    equation system ( [ 36.4 ] ) has the conservation laws of the type of kirchhoff s generalized integrals i.e. the conservation laws related to motion equation invariance under translation and rotation of coordinates system :    @xmath144    @xmath145    @xmath146    as in case of point vortices there are three independent motion integrals in the involution : @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this means that the motion of one vortex and one point dipole are integrable .",
    "the exact non stationary solutions for plane case without boundaries are given in @xcite .",
    "naturally , the question arises , is it possible or not to add for the non stationary case in expansion ( [ 9 ] ) more higher derivatives of @xmath59 - function , i.e.multipoles of higher order .",
    "multipoles of higher order , than dipole produce two kinds of difficulties .",
    "first of all , as it was shown  in sectoin 2 , that , generally speaking , singularities of this kind have self - interaction . from dynamical point of view , the substitution of high multipoles in euler equation in accordance with the formula ( [ a.3 ] ) appendix a , engenders overdetermined equation system .",
    "hence , for the non stationary case , vorticity expansion ( [ 9 ] ) is compatible with euler equation with @xmath149 if the following sufficient conditions are satisfied :    1.multipole moments starting from the quadruple one are equal to zero .",
    "2.singularities motion obeys the equations ( [ 36.4 ] ) .",
    "let us now examine stationary case , when @xmath150 in this case the stream function can depend on time since singularities coordinates and dipoles moments are function on time .",
    "the substitution of vorticity ( [ 9 ] ) in euler equation ( [ 3 ] ) gives for the smooth part of stream function the equation :    @xmath151    @xmath152\\frac{df(\\psi ) } { d\\psi } = 0.\\ ] ]    the first term is related to explicit dependence of stream function @xmath2 on time , the second one and the third one are related to singularities motion .",
    "the fourth term in ( [ 37 ] ) is related to dependence of dipole moments on time .",
    "we have to add to the equation ( [ 37 ] ) equations for singularities parts of vorticity field which were already given ( formulae ( [ 36.4 ] ) ) . in the case",
    "@xmath153 the equation ( [ 37 ] ) is absent and only singularities motion equations remain .",
    "the sufficient condition of stationarity , i.e. the ( [ 37 ] ) goes to zero when @xmath154 consists in the following :    1.stream function does not depend explicitly on time .",
    "2.all singularities do not move .",
    "3.all dipole moments @xmath42 are not function of time .",
    "all terms which contain the velocity @xmath102 in equation ( [ 28 ] ) form obviously the poisson brackets @xmath155 .",
    "that is why the sufficient condition of immobility  for all singularities  and of stationarity for all dipole moments is the condition when poisson brackets goes to zero :",
    "@xmath156    this means that all factors of all independent singularities in poisson brackets go to zero ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "now we consider the problem of exact stationary solutions of 2d - euler equation , when @xmath157 further , it is easy to consider the poisson brackets    @xmath158    as dimensionless .",
    "let us choose the _ anzatz _ ( [ 9 ] ) in the form :    @xmath159    when function @xmath34 is chosen in the same way as in the stuart work @xcite ; we suppose that coefficients @xmath160 and @xmath161 are constant , and the coordinate @xmath62 is not depending on time .",

    "@xmath255 that is why    @xmath256    the condition ( [ 72 ] ) means , that the complex singular point is structurally stable , because the necessary and sufficient condition of the structural stability for complex singular point on plane is , that its index @xmath257 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "in this work we want to call attention to the fact that there are exact solutions of 2d - euler equation which contain point singularities more complex , than singularities which are usually considered as typical ones for 2d - euler equation .",

    "presence of smooth part of vorticity field in the equation ( [ 5.3 ] ) gives exact solutions with the more complex singularity of index 3 .",
    "as it is shown in this work , the singularity of vector field of index 3 can be interpreted in complex form as a fusion in function @xmath172 ( [ 52 ] ) of the pole , which corresponds to point vortex , with essential singular point which corresponds to point dipole . in real form , as it can be seen from the equation ( [ 67 ] ) , for the final stream function the essential singularity splits up into singularities of point vortex and point dipoles types .",

    "we did not deal with questions of the construction of more complex solutions expressed by special functions and with important questions of stability of vortex configurations with complex singular points .",
