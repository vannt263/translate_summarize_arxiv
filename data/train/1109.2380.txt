    "a polynomial semigroup is a semigroup generated by a family of non - constant polynomial maps on @xmath8 the work on the dynamics of rational semigroups was initiated by a. hinkkanen and g. j. martin ( @xcite ) , who were interested in the role of the dynamics of polynomial semigroups while studying various one - complex - dimensional moduli spaces for discrete groups of mbius transformations , and by f. ren s group ( @xcite ) , who studied such semigroups from the perspective of random dynamical systems .",
    "the theory of the dynamics of rational semigroups on @xmath7 has developed in many directions since the 1990s ( ) . we recommend @xcite as an introductory article . for a rational semigroup @xmath9 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the maximal open subset of @xmath11 where @xmath9 is normal .",

    "indeed , because of ( [ bsseq ] ) , the analysis of the julia sets of rational semigroups somewhat resembles `` backward iterated functions systems '' , however since each map @xmath18 is not in general injective ( critical points ) , some qualitatively different extra effort in the case of semigroups is needed .",
    "the theory of the dynamics of rational semigroups borrows and develops tools from both of these theories .",
    "it has also developed its own unique methods , notably the skew product approach ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the theory of the dynamics of rational semigroups is intimately related to that of the random dynamics of rational maps .",
    "the first study of random complex dynamics was given in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "random dynamics of quadratic polynomials were investigated .",
    "the paper @xcite develops the thermodynamic formalism of random distance expanding maps and , in particular , applies it to random polynomials . the deep relation between these fields ( rational semigroups , random complex dynamics , and ( backward ) ifs )",

    "for example , for a random dynamical system in remark  [ r : t0tinfty ] , @xmath21 is continuous on @xmath11 and the set of varying points of @xmath21 is equal to the julia set of figure [ fig : connosc1 ] , which is a thin fractal set with hausdorff dimension strictly less than @xmath1 . from this point of view also , it is very interesting and important to investigate the figure and the dimension of the julia sets of rational semigroups .    in this paper , for an expanding finitely generated rational semigroup @xmath22 , we deal at length with the relation between the bowen parameter @xmath23 ( the unique zero of the pressure function , see definition  [ d : bpara ] ) of the multimap @xmath24 and the hausdorff dimension of the julia set of @xmath25 . in the usual iteration of a single expanding rational map , it is well known that the hausdorff dimension of the julia set is equal to the bowen parameter and they are strictly less than two . for",
    "a general expanding finitely generated rational semigroup @xmath22 , it was shown that the bowen parameter is larger than or equal to the hausdorff dimension of the julia set ( @xcite ) . if we assume further that the semigroup satisfies the `` open set condition '' ( see definition  [ d : osc ] ) , then it was shown that they are equal ( @xcite ) . however , if we do not assume the open set condition , then there are a lot of examples for which the bowen parameter is strictly larger than the hausdorff dimension of the julia set .",
