    "in this paper we present high and low resolution spectroscopy of the optical afterglow of grb081008 , observed using uves and fors2 spectrographs at the vlt @xmath0 hr after the trigger .",
    "we detect several absorption features ( both neutral and excited ) at the common redshift of @xmath22 .",
    "the spectra show that the gas absorbing the grb afterglow light can be described with three components identified in this paper as i , ii and iii , according to their decreasing velocity values .",
    "we estimated the distances between the grb and the absorbers . we find a distance for component i of @xmath23 pc and @xmath24 , using feii and siii , respectively .",
    "the siii leads to a smaller uncertainty because its fine structure level is more sensitive to the flux experienced by the absorber .",
    "other papers mainly use feii as distance estimator , so for a safer comparison is better to consider our feii value . for component",
    "ii , this distance is greater , @xmath25 pc .",
    "we stress that these values are obtained assuming a three component absorber .",
    "however , we can not exclude a higher number of components , because our spectrum has a low s / n and a limited resolution .",
    "component ii is far away from grb than component i , as expected given the lack of fine structure lines in this absorber .",
    "component iii does not show excited levels at all , and only shows low ionization states .",
    "therefore , this is produced by an absorber located even farther from the grb , in a region which is not significantly influenced by the prompt / afterglow emission .",
    "component i of grb081008 is the closest to a grb ever recorded .",
    "in fact , for the 6 other grbs for which the grb / absorber distance have been estimated , the closest components are at @xmath26 pc from the grb ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "2007 ; delia et al .",
    "2009,a , b ; ledoux et al . 2009 ; delia et al . 2010 ; thne et al .",
    "the values reported in literature have been corrected for the @xmath27 factor discussed by vreeswijk ( 2011 ) .",
    "this behaviour can be interpreted as due to a dense environment close to the grb explosion site .",
    "this high density is possibly witnessed by the a non negligible dust amount ( see below ) and by the metal content of the grb surrounding medium .",
    "in fact , the grb081008 surroundings have the highest metallicity and the highest abundances of , e.g. , feii and niii , among this sub - sample of grbs .",
    "this high density in the grb surroundings could constitute a barrier to the grb prompt / afterglow emission , that is not able to strongly excite the interstellar medium up to the distances reached by the other grbs .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density is @xmath28 , while that estimated from _ swift _",
    "xrt data is @xmath29 ( campana et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the latter value is for a solar abundance medium . using @xmath30",
    "we evaluate the grb081008 host galaxy s metallicity .",
    "the values we find are in the range [ x / h ] @xmath31 to @xmath8 with respect to the solar abundances .",
    "this value lies in the middle of the grb distribution , ( savaglio 2006 ; prochaska et al . 2007 ; savaglio , glazebrook & le borgne , 2009 ) . from x",
    " ray data a limit of [ x / h ] @xmath32 ( @xmath33 confidence limit ) can be set assuming a solar abundance pattern and requiring that the absorbing medium is not thomson thick",
    ". if we set the metallicity to [ x / h ] = @xmath34 , the absorbing column density in the x - rays is higher , namely , @xmath35 and higher for lower metallicities .",
    "fynbo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and campana et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that in grbs with a detectable ly@xmath36 feature ( i.e. , those at @xmath37 ) @xmath38 is on average a factor of @xmath39 higher than @xmath40 , and grb081008 follows this trend .",
    "the intense grb flux , which ionizes the hydrogen and prevents part of it to be optically detected , is the common explanation for this discrepancy ( fynbo et al .",
    "2009 ; campana et al . 2010 ; schady et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that observed abundances of feii and znii are significantly different ( [ fe / h]@xmath41 and [ zn / h]@xmath42 ) .",
    "this can be ascribed to the different refractory properties of the two elements , with the former that preferentially tends to produce dust grains while the latter prefers the gas phase .",
    "the comparison between these ` opposite ' elements can thus provide information on the dust content in the grb environments . in order to be more quantitative ,",
    "we derive the dust depletion pattern for the grb081008 environment , following the method described in savaglio ( 2000 ) .",
    "we consider the four depletion patterns observed in the milky way , namely , those in the warm halo ( wh ) , warm disk + halo ( whd ) , warm disk ( wd ) and cool disk ( cd ) clouds ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "we find that the best fit to our data is given by the wh cloud pattern , with a metallicity of @xmath43 and a grb dust - to - metal ratio comparable to that of the wh environment , e.g. , @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "this metallicity value is consistent with our [ zn / h ] measurement .",
    "this agreement is self - consistent with the use of zinc as a good indicator of metallicity .",
    "since the latter quantity is linked to the extinction ( see e.g. , savaglio , fall & fiore 2003 ) we derive @xmath11 mag along the grb081008 line of sight .",
    "we check this value by modeling the flux - calibrated fors2 spectrum .",
    "the sed is dominated by the ly@xmath36 which is difficult to model given the high fluctuations and other absorption lines .",
    "anyway , the inferred @xmath45 value is low and compatible with that evaluated from the dust depletion .",
    "another hint of dust is the non detection of feii in the third component .",
    "the feii column densities in components i and ii are very similar , and this lets us believe that in component iii the iron is present as well , but in the dust form .",
    "the higher presence of dust in components far away from the grb has already been pointed out by delia et al .",
    "they report a possible presence of dust in component iii of grb050730 , while the closer component ii ( featuring feii fine structure lines ) shows more iron in the gas state .",
    "the detection of more dust far away from the grb can be explained since dust grains containing iron tends to be efficiently destroyed during a blast wave occurring after a grb explosion ( perna , lazzati & fiore 2003 ) .",
    "the analysis of the fors2 spectra extends our surveyed wavelength range , allowing the detection of higher ionization species , such as civ and siiv .",
    "anyway , line profiles of high and low ionization species rarely match in redshift space and often if they do , it is because the line blending can not be resolved in a spectrum , regardless of resolution and s / n .",
    "we stress that the availability of simultaneous high and low resolution spectra of a grb afterglow is an extremely rare event . in this context , the comparison of the column densities obtained fitting the line profile of a high resolution spectrum with that estimated by the curve of growth analysis applied to a low resolution one could be extremely important .",
    "in fact , this can help to determine a range of column densities for which it is safe to apply the curve of growth analysis when high resolution data are missing .",
    "this is because high column densities can result in the saturation effect , a problem that is difficult to address using low resolution spectra only ( see e.g. penprase et al .",
    "prochaska ( 2006 ) widely discuss the limits and perils of the cog analysis applied to low resolution data .",
    "they find that this kind of analysis tends to underestimate the column densities of the absorbing species .",
    "this is because strong transitions drive the cog fit since the relative error associated to their w@xmath46 is smaller than that for weak ones .",
    "nevertheless , strong transitions are more affected by saturation , and in order to match their observed column densities , the cog fit is forced towards high values of the effective doppler parameter .",
    "high resolution data often show that the main contribution to the column density of strong transitions comes from one narrow component . on the other hand ,",
    "the main contribution to the w@xmath46 comes from other components which account for a small fraction of the column density .",
    "these inferred high values for the effective doppler parameter are thus mimicking a more complex situation , with the result of underestimating the real column densities . for what concerns grb081008",
    "the uves observations show no or just mild saturation even for the strongest transitions , and the two main components give a similar contribution to the total column densities .",
    "this is the reason why there is a good agreement between cog analysis of low resolution data and line fitting analysis of high resolution ones for this particular grb ( within @xmath12 in the worst cases ) .    finally , we detect two weak intervening systems in our spectra .",
    "the first one is a civ absorber in the fors2 spectrum at @xmath47 , and the second one is a mgii system in the uves spectrum at @xmath48 .",
    "this last system has @xmath49 , the detection limit being @xmath50 at the @xmath51 confidence level .",
    "the redshift path analyzed for mgii is @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the uves spectrum , and @xmath54 for the fors2 one .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for a deep and critical reading of the paper , which strongly increased its quality .",
