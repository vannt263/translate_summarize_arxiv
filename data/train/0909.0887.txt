    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for proofs and more detail .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the set of vertices of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "the torus @xmath17 where @xmath6 can be identified with the set of all functions @xmath18 .",
    "the support @xmath19 of a function @xmath18 is defined as the set of vertices @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "one defines @xmath22 to be the set of all functions @xmath23 such that their support @xmath24 generates a complete subgraph of @xmath1 , i.e. any two vertices of the support are connected by an edge in @xmath1 .",

    "fix the cell decomposition of @xmath25 consisting of a 0-cell @xmath26 and a 1-cell @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath28 is a cell subcomplex ; the cells of @xmath15 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with complete subgraphs of @xmath1 .",
    "namely , given a subset @xmath29 one considers the set @xmath30 of all functions @xmath18 with support equal @xmath31 ; clearly @xmath30 is a cell of dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the cohomology algebra of @xmath15 with integral coefficients is the quotient @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the exterior algebra generated by degree one classes corresponding to the vertices @xmath35 of @xmath1 and the ideal @xmath36 is generated by the degree two monomials @xmath37 such that the corresponding vertices @xmath38 are not connected by an edge .",

    "there are many results in the literature about the clique number of random graphs ; we may interpret these results as statements about the cohomological dimension of graph groups build out of random graphs .",

    "we may assume that @xmath85 ; then the integers @xmath86 and @xmath87 either coincide or differ by @xmath88 .",
    "thus , according theorem [ matula ] , the cohomological dimension @xmath89 for a random graph @xmath1 takes on one of at most two values depending on @xmath7 and @xmath53 , with probability approaching @xmath88 as @xmath90 .",

    "therefore , @xmath98 clearly , @xmath99 tends to infinity since @xmath100 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "given a mechanical system , a motion planning algorithm is a function which assigns to any pair of states of the system , an initial state and a desired state , a continuous motion of the system starting at the initial state and ending at the desired state .",
    "the design of effective motion planning algorithms is one of the challenges of modern robotics , see @xcite .",
    "motion planning algorithms are applicable in various situations when the system is autonomous and operates in a fully or partially known environment .",
    "the complexity of motion planning algorithms is measured by a numerical invariant @xmath101 which depends on the homotopy type of the configuration space @xmath102 of the system @xcite .",
    "this invariant is defined as the schwarz genus ( also known as the sectional category ) of the path - space fibration @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the space of all continuous paths @xmath105\\to x$ ] equipped with the compact - open topology and @xmath106 is the map associating to a path @xmath107\\to x$ ] its pair of endpoints .",
    "explicitly , @xmath101 is the smallest integer @xmath108 such that @xmath109 admits an open cover @xmath110 with the property that there exists a continuous section @xmath111 of ( [ fibration ] ) for each @xmath112 .",
    "if @xmath102 is an euclidean neighborhood retract then @xmath101 can be equivalently characterized as the minimal integer @xmath108 such that there exists a section @xmath113 of the fibration @xmath53 with the property that @xmath109 can be represented as the union of @xmath108 mutually disjoint locally compact sets @xmath114 such that the restriction @xmath115 is continuous for @xmath112 , see @xcite , proposition 4.2 .",
    "a section @xmath116 as above represents a motion planning algorithm : given a pair @xmath117 the image @xmath118 is a continuous motion of the system starting at the state @xmath119 and ending at the state @xmath120 .    intuitively , the topological complexity @xmath101 can be understood as a measure of the navigational complexity of the topological space @xmath102 ; it is the minimal number of continuous rules which are needed to describe a motion planning algorithm in @xmath102 .",
    "the invariant @xmath101 admits an upper bound in terms of the dimension of the configuration space @xmath102 , @xmath121 see @xcite , theorem 4 .",
    "there are many examples when inequality ( [ upperbound ] ) is sharp : take for instance @xmath122 , the connected sum of two copies of a torus , having the topological complexity @xmath123 .",
    "however for any simply connected space @xmath102 one has a more powerful upper bound @xmath124 see @xcite .",
    "the latter inequality is sharp for any simply connected closed symplectic manifold @xmath102 , see @xcite .",
    "there are many other examples when the inequality ( [ upperbound ] ) is not sharp .",
    "it was established in @xcite that for any finite cell complex @xmath102 with @xmath125 one has @xmath126    for example @xmath127 for all @xmath7 ; moreover , @xmath128 if and only if @xmath7 is a power of @xmath129 , see corollary 14 of @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper states that the inequality ( [ upperbound ] ) is asymptotically very close to be an equality in the case of eilenberg - maclane spaces of random graph groups .",
    "this statement is consistent with the general philosophy asserting that topological invariants of random spaces are simpler than their deterministic analogues .",
    "consider the probability space @xmath9 of random graphs on @xmath7 vertices with probability given by formula ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "for any @xmath12 consider the corresponding eilenberg - maclane complex @xmath15 ( see  2 ) and its topological complexity @xmath130 , as defined in the previous section .",
    "[ main1 ] fix an arbitrary @xmath131 .",
    "then for any random graph @xmath12 one has @xmath132 asymptotically almost surely , where @xmath133 is given by formula ( [ approx ] ) .",
    "in other words , probability that a graph @xmath12 does not satisfy inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) tends to zero when @xmath7 tends to infinity .",
    "it is clear that the integers on the left and on the right of inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) differ at most by @xmath129 .",
    "hence theorem [ main1 ] determines the value of the topological complexity @xmath134 for a random graph with ambiguity of at most 2 .",
    "comparing with the result of theorem [ matula ] we obtain          by an @xmath137 _ bi - clique _ in a graph @xmath1 we understand an ordered pair consisting of two disjoint complete subgraphs of @xmath1 on @xmath42 vertices .",
    "to specify an @xmath137 _ bi - clique _ one has to determine an @xmath42-element subset @xmath31 of the set of vertices of @xmath1 and an @xmath42-element subset @xmath138 in the complement @xmath139 such that the induced graphs on @xmath31 and @xmath138 are complete .",
    "we know from sections  2 , 3 that @xmath140 if and only if @xmath1 contains an @xmath42-clique , i.e. a maximal complete subgraph on @xmath42 vertices . by theorem of cohen and pruidze",
    "@xcite one has @xmath141 if @xmath1 contains an @xmath137 bi - clique .    in the rest of",
    "this section we set @xmath142 theorem [ main1 ] follows once we have shown that a random graph @xmath12 contains an @xmath137 bi - clique a.a.s .",
    "the right hand side of the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) follows from the general upper bound ( [ ineq2 ] ) and from the right hand side of ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "let @xmath143 be an integer and let @xmath144 denote the number of @xmath137 bi - cliques in random graph .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath145 asymptotically almost surely , i.e. @xmath146 the proof of ( [ pos ] ) will use the second moment method and will be based on the inequality @xmath147 see @xcite , page 54 .",
    "thus , our statement follows once we show that @xmath148    let @xmath31 and @xmath138 be disjoint @xmath42-element subsets of the set of vertices of @xmath149 and let @xmath150 denote the function which equals 1 on a graph @xmath151 if and only if @xmath31 and @xmath138 form a bi - clique in @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath152 where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs of disjoint @xmath42-element subsets of @xmath153 .",
    "note that one obviously has @xmath154 and thus @xmath155 where @xmath156 denotes the multynomial coefficient .",
    "similarly , @xmath157 here @xmath158 and @xmath159 run over all ordered pairs of disjoint @xmath42-element subsets of the set of vertices @xmath160 .    denoting @xmath161 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) we find @xmath162 therefore taking into account ( [ square ] ) one obtains the following expression @xmath163 here @xmath164 denotes a vector and @xmath165 is the set of all vectors @xmath166 with nonnegative integer components satisfying the inequalities @xmath167 see figure [ fig1 ] . in formula ( [ formula ] ) the coefficient @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 and @xmath170 while @xmath171      next we mention the symmetry of the problem .",
    "there are two commuting involutions @xmath175 where @xmath176 these two involutions generate an action of the group @xmath177 of @xmath165 which preserves both functions @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "this action is transitive on the four coordinates .",

    "therefore , the sum of all coefficients @xmath168 with @xmath185 tends to zero .",
