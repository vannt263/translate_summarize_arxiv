    "our method can be used to extend the classification to the reductive isotropy @xmath16 in dimension 6 as well , which includes such complex manifolds as @xmath42 , but the tables become rather big .",

    "the snk condition is closely related with the condition of non - degeneracy of @xmath4 ( recall that this means @xmath43 ) . for the calabi almost complex structure @xmath3 on @xmath13 it is known that its automorphism group is the compact real form @xmath12 .",

    "the brackets @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by the lie algebra structure of @xmath53 and the @xmath53-module structure of @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the only missing ingredient is the bracket @xmath61 , and it determines the full bracket @xmath62    [ coro1 ] the jacobi identity of the resulting bracket @xmath63 , involving an element from @xmath53 , is equivalent to @xmath53-equivariancy of @xmath64 .",

    "the jacobi relation involving 3 elements from @xmath53 , @xmath69 , vanishes as @xmath53 is a lie algebra .",
    "the jacobi relation involving 2 elements from @xmath53 and 1 from @xmath52 vanishes as @xmath52 is an @xmath53-representation .",
    "finally the jacobi relation involving 1 element from @xmath53 and 2 from @xmath52 is precisely the equivariancy of the map @xmath64 .",

    "thus @xmath53-equivariancy of @xmath64 can be effectively checked via the representation theory . on the contrary , vanishing of @xmath78",
    "is a set of linear and quadratic relations on @xmath64 to be checked directly ( representation theory can help here too : as @xmath79 is @xmath53-equivariant , we can decompose @xmath80 into irreducibles and apply schur s lemma ) .",
