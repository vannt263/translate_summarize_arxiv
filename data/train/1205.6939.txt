    "within the penn state - toru planet search ( ptps , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* niedzielski & wolszczan 2008 ) ) , which is a radial velocity project to search for and characterize planets around stars more massive than the sun , the stellar integral properties ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are currently determined from a combination of atmospheric parameters ( surface gravity , @xmath3 and [ fe / h ] ) together with the evolutionary tracks ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* girardi  2000 ) ) .",
    "unfortunately this method is uncertain due to difficulties in accurate placement of individual stars on the h - r diagram .",
    "[ fig1 ] presents the comparison between the determinations of stellar radii from our spectroscopic analysis ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zieliski  2011 ) ) and the empirical calibration by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* alonso  ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "both results are in general agreement , nevertheless , large discrepancies for individual objects are visible .",
    "the uncertainties of our radii determinations based on stellar @xmath3 and @xmath2 was found to be 0.8  @xmath4 on average but due to missing parallaxes the results are strongly dependent on adopted stellar evolutionary models as well as on photometric data quality .",
    "we plan to improve this by using the chara array ( ( * ? ?",
    "* ten  brummelaar  2005 ) ) for direct measurements of stellar radii and , in turn , using the relation @xmath5 , constrain better the stellar mass . on the other hand , the luminosity can be calculated with high accuracy when using the stefan - boltzmann law directly .",
    "two stars from ptps survey were already observed with the chara array : hd  17092 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baines  2009 ) ) and hd  214868 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baines  2010 ) ) .",
    "the results obtained from direct measurements agree well with the spectroscopic values estimated by us ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* niedzielski  2007 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zieliski  2011 ) ) .",
    "however , the accuracy of interferometry - based measurements is significantly better .",
    "our observing list was derived from the ptps survey of evolved stars with rv planet candidates and comprises 212 stars suitable for chara observations .",
    "these stars have already been observed spectroscopically using the hobby - eberly telescope ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ramsey  1998 ) ) , so high - resolution spectra are available .",
    "the targets are sufficiently bright ( v @xmath6  mag and k @xmath7  mag ) and nearby ( @xmath8  mas ) giants with large radii that can be easily directly measured interferometrically .",
    "using new chara measurements we will be able to obtain high - precision radii measurements and in turn better estimates of the stellar masses . with the angular diameter of a precision of 2 % , the stellar radius can be determined with a precision better than 5 % .",
    "the largest contributor to the error budget is the parallax , therefore , after taking into account 10 % parallax uncertainty , the final mass will then be precise within 0.1  @xmath9 .",
    "this is significantly better compared to our current estimates based on moderate quality photometry and evolutionary models . for ptps targets studied in detail , we estimated masses between 1 and 3  @xmath9 and even after critical assessment an uncertainty of 30",
    "% remains .",
    "hence , the chara data will improve the precision in mass sufficiently for the subsequent analysis .",
