    "diffraction has always been an important part of the studies performed in experiments involving hadron interactions .",
    "this is true also for the lhc , where a large community works on both theoretical and experimental aspects of possible diffractive measurements .    in the majority of collisions at the lhc interacting protons break - up and their remnants",
    "are populating forward regions .",
    "however , in a fraction of events the protons interact coherently , either electromagnetically  by exchanging a photon , or strongly  via an exchange of a colour singlet object named pomeron .",
    "in such situation , called a diffractive production , one or both protons stay intact , lose part of their energy and are scattered at very small angles into the accelerator beam pipe .",
    "the central exclusive production ( cep ) consists a special class among diffractive processes . in these events",
    "both protons stay intact and all energy available due to the colourless exchange is used to produce the central system .",
    "a diagram of central exclusive jet production is shown in figure  [ fig_exc_jj_diag ] .",
    "such events were observed at the tevatron  @xcite and are also expected to happen at the lhc .",
    "their measurement will be an important test for the applicability of qcd for such processes and can serve as a discrimination tool for phenomenological models .",
    "there are few theoretical descriptions of the exclusive jet production available . in this paper the model developed by khoze - martin - ryskin ( kmr )  @xcite is used . in the kmr model",
    "a perturbative approach is used  the colourless exchange is represented by an exchange of two gluons ; a hard and a soft one .",
    "the role of the soft gluon is to provide the colour screening that ensures that no net colour charge is exchanged between the two protons .",
    "the exclusivity is assured via a sudakov form factor  @xcite , which suppresses the radiation of additional gluons .",
    "the two - gluon exchange and lack of additional radiation means that the central exclusive dijet production is extremely rare in comparison to standard dijet production at the lhc .",
    "in addition , the dijet system is produced in a @xmath3 state .",
    "the exclusive jets can be also produced as a result of photon - photon interaction . however , as this process is of electromagnetic nature , the expected cross - section is much smaller than the one for estimated within the kmr approach .",
    "thus it is not further considered .    in order to perform a fully exclusive measurement",
    "there is a need to measure both the jets and the intact protons .",
    "the requirement of both protons being tagged often forces a production of large amount of energy in the central region which , in turn , significantly reduces the cross - section . in consequence , there is a need to collect a large amount of data ( @xmath4fb@xmath5 ) and to operate in high pile - up environment .",
    "such measurement is feasible ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) but very challenging . in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility of the measurement of the central exclusive jet production at the lhc at the centre - of - mass energy of @xmath6 tev in cases when only one intact proton is measured .",
    "the kmr model is embedded in the fpmc generator  @xcite .",
    "fpmc is a modification of herwig 6.5  @xcite and uses the final state parton showering and hadronisation algorithms included in that generator . for exclusive processes",
    "the initial state parton showers are forbidden and accounted for as a part of the calculation . due to the exclusivity requirements",
    "all energy lost by interacting protons is transfered into the produced central system .",
    "the diffractive backgrounds : double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) and single diffractive ( sd ) jets were also generated using fpmc , assuming the rapidity gap survival factor of 0.03 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "the generation of these events is based on the the resolved pomeron model @xcite and makes use of h1 2007 fit b  @xcite .",
    "the multi - parton interactions ( mpi ) were turned off .",
    "the non - diffractive ( nd ) jets were generated using pythia8  @xcite .",
    "minimum - bias events were generated using pythia8 with mbr tune  @xcite .",
    "the following processes were taken into account : non - diffractive production , elastic scattering , single diffractive dissociation , double diffractive dissociation and central diffraction .",
    "jets were reconstructed using anti-@xmath7 algorithm with the jet radius @xmath8 as implemented in the fastjet package  @xcite . as an input for the analysis , all generated final state particles were considered .",
    "generated protons were transported to the location of the considered forward detector using the fptrack program  @xcite  a tool dedicated for fast proton tracking through the lhc magnetic structures . after the transport the proton energy was reconstructed using a procedure described in ref .",
    "exclusive jet production events could be selected by looking for rapidity gaps in the forward direction or by measuring the forward protons .",
    "this paper focuses on the proton tagging technique .",
    "the studies were performed for the atlas detector  @xcite case ( with two sets of forward proton detectors : alfa and afp ) , but the conclusions are also valid for the similar set of detectors installed around the cms / totem interaction point  @xcite .",
    "the alfa ( absolute luminosity for atlas ) detector system consists of four detector stations placed symmetrically with respect to the atlas ip at 237 m and 245 m  @xcite . in each alfa station",
    "there are two roman pot devices allowing vertical movement of the detectors .",
    "the spatial resolution of the alfa detectors is assumed to be of 30 @xmath9 m in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the second considered system is the afp ( atlas forward proton ) detector  horizontally moving stations planned to be installed symmetrically with respect to the atlas ip ( ip1 ) at 204 m and 212 m  @xcite . stations located closer to the ip1 will contain the tracking detectors , whereas the outer ones will be equipped with the tracking and timing devices .",
    "the reconstruction resolution of tracking detectors is foreseen to be of 10 and 30 @xmath9 m in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , correspondingly .",
    "there are several lhc machine set - ups , at which the alfa and afp detectors could take data . in the simplest possible way they could be characterized by the value of the betatron function at the interaction point , @xmath12 . in this work",
    "two such lhc machine settings will be considered : @xmath0  m and @xmath1  m. the details of these optics are described in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas here only the key features are presented .",
    "the @xmath0  m is a common setting for all lhc high luminosity runs  the beam is strongly focused at the ip and the non - zero value of the crossing angle is introduced in order to avoid collisions of proton bunches outside the ip region .",
    "the @xmath1  m optics was developed in order to measure the properties of the elastic scattering . due to the high value of the betatron function",
    "the beam angular divergence is very low and the beam is not as strongly focused as in case of the collision optics . in these settings",
    "the value of the crossing angle could be zero or non - zero , depending on the number of bunches . nevertheless , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crossing angle has a marginal impact on the detector acceptance .",
    "therefore , in the following this effect will not be considered .",
    "not all the scattered protons can be registered in the forward detectors .",
    "a proton can be too close to the beam to be detected or it can hit the lhc element ( collimator , beam pipe , magnet ) upstream the afp or alfa station . the geometric acceptance , defined as the ratio of the number of protons of a given relative energy loss ( @xmath13 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath14 ) that reached the detector station to the total number of the scattered protons having @xmath15 and @xmath14 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_acceptance ] . in the calculations , the beam properties at the ip ,",
    "the beam chamber geometry , the lhc lattice magnetic properties and the distance between the beam centre and the detector edge were taken into account . the detector distance from the beam centre",

    "optics the region of high acceptance ( black area , @xmath17 ) is limited to @xmath18 gev and @xmath19 .",
    "these limits change to @xmath20 gev and @xmath21 for @xmath1  m optics . for the alfa detectors and @xmath0  m optics the region of high acceptance",
    "is limited by @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 , which is significantly smaller than in case of the afp detectors .",
    "the picture changes drastically when @xmath1 optics is considered , as these settings are optimised for the elastic scattering measurement in which the access to low @xmath14 values for @xmath24 is crucial ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xcite ) .    the acceptance could be also expressed in terms of the so - called missing mass , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the relative energy loss of the intact protons . in order to generate the mass spectrum",
    "a toy model was used : @xmath28}{\\xi_1 \\cdot \\xi_2},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the four - momentum transfer squared of the protons and the slope was set to @xmath31 gev@xmath32 .",
    "such model is expected to work for diffractive events , whereas for the exclusive ones there could be some differences ( especially in @xmath15 distribution ) . however , this will have only small impact on the normalisation while the acceptance range will not be influenced .",
    "this is due to the fact that the distribution of the boost of the central system is qualitatively similar for all sensible models ",
    "symmetric and flat around 0 .",
    "the acceptance for double tagged events as a function of the missing mass is shown in figure  [ fig_acceptance_mass_double_tag ] for both detectors and both lhc optics .",
    "the various ranges of masses are available for these settings , namely :    * @xmath33 gev for afp and @xmath0  m , * @xmath34 gev for afp and @xmath1  m , * @xmath35 gev for alfa and @xmath0  m , * @xmath36 gev for alfa and @xmath1  m.        in order to judge whether the measurement is possible for a given experimental conditions the expected cross - section needs to be considered .",
    "its values , as a function of missing mass , are shown in figure  [ fig_mass_cross_section ] .        the cross - section drops rapidly with increasing the missing mass value .",
    "such relatively small cross - section for all cases except alfa and @xmath1  m optics , implies the need of large values of the integrated luminosity  at least of the order of inverse femtobarns . in consequence ,",
    "the measurement has to be performed in harsh experimental conditions where several proton - proton interactions during one bunch crossing are possible . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite such a measurement is possible but very challenging .",
    "moreover , as the signal - to - background ratio is not expected to be large , the systematic effects like the background modelling need to be considered .    in order to remove these drawbacks , in this paper",
    "we discuss cases in which exactly one proton is within the detector acceptance , whereas the other one is too close to the beam to be detected .",
    "such events will be hereafter named the single tagged events .",
    "the acceptance for such events as a function of the missing mass is shown in figure  [ fig_acceptance_mass_single_tag ] for both detectors and both lhc optics .",
    "comparison between figures [ fig_mass_cross_section ] and [ fig_acceptance_mass_single_tag ] leads to the conclusion that , except for the case of alfa and @xmath1  m optics , the acceptance for single tagged events is shifted towards the lower masses , hence higher cross - sections .",
    "in order to mimic a single tagged exclusive event , there has to be , apart from two jets , a final state proton visible in the forward detector . in case of the dpe jet production ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_bg_diag ] ( a ) ) one of the protons has to be within and one outside the acceptance . for the single diffractive jets ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bg_diag ] ( b ) ) the diffractive proton must be visible . in case of the non - diffractive jet production ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bg_diag ] ( c ) ) there is no forward proton present in the system .",
    "nevertheless , due to the non - zero pile - up value it could happen that there is simultaneous production of soft diffractive event and a diffractively scattered proton will reach the forward detector .",
    "due to the sudakov  @xcite form factor , the cross - section for the exclusive jet production is much smaller than that for the non - diffractive or diffractive jets . in consequence , in order to have a pure sample there is a need to impose several selection requirements .",
    "the presence of the forward proton is a natural requirement in the presented analysis .",
    "the probabilities of observing single tagged events for both considered detectors and both optics settings are listed in table  [ tab_tag_prob ] . as earlier ,",
    "the distance between the detector and the beam centre was set to 15  @xmath16 and 10  @xmath16 for the @xmath0  m and the @xmath1  m optics , correspondingly .",

    "in such case the probability of observing a minimum - bias vertex ( w / o assumption of such an event being tagged in forward detector ) must be considered .",
    "this probability is the same for all the considered settings and is of about 0.8 .      in the exclusive event",
    "the relative energy loss of measured proton ( @xmath37 ) is correlated to the jet system properties , which can be expressed as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the rapidity and the mass of the jet system , respectively . in practice , it is convenient to use the relative energy loss difference : @xmath41    the correlation gets weaker when the detector effects are considered .",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath37 depends on properties of a given optics and on the detector reconstruction resolution and is close to  @xcite :    * 10 gev for afp and @xmath0  m , * 35 gev for afp and @xmath1  m , * 30 gev for alfa and @xmath0  m , * 40 gev for alfa and @xmath1  m.    for jets , the uncertainty of the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle reconstruction was assumed to be gaussian with the width of 0.05 .",
