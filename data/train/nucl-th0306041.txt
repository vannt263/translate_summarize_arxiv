    "we treat the gas of quarks as a heat bath for the chiral field , with temperature @xmath2 and baryon - chemical potential @xmath1 .",

    "we prefer , instead , adopting an alternative approach to obtain the hydrodynamic equations for our system : the variational formulation @xcite .",
    "this approach provides a natural and unified way of merging chiral and fluid dynamics once the action of the system is specified . for a different treatment of the hydrodynamics of nuclear matter in the chiral limit ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the variational formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics has been recently applied to several physical systems , especially in the realms of astrophysics and condensed matter . in the former",
    "it has been used , for instance , to incorporate the effects of local turbulent motion in supernova explosion mechanisms , and can prove to be useful in the analysis of the relativistic motion of blast waves in models for gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in soft condensed matter",
    ", it has been used to study the bubble dynamics in sonoluminescence experiments , in particular in deriving the relativistic generalization of the rayleigh - plesset equation @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review how to obtain the usual equations of relativistic hydrodynamics within this framework , and derive in detail the case in which we have a chiral field coupled to an expanding quark fluid .",
    "we describe the state of the fluid in terms of the four - velocity @xmath40 , the proper baryon density , @xmath41 , and the proper entropy density , @xmath42 . in what follows",

    "it is important to notice that the effective lagrangian , ( [ l_eff ] ) , evaluated in the proper comoving frame of the fluid , @xmath69 is nothing but _ minus _ the thermodynamic potential of the system .",
    "this fact will be useful to couple the chiral degrees of freedom to the quark fluid motion .",
    "the procedure outlined above for the derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics presents a number of nice features .",
    "first , it can be easily generalized to include other degrees of freedom such as the chiral field . secondly , although we have implicitly used a minkowski metric , the generalization to the case of curved space - times is straightforward .",
    "this will be discussed later , when we consider applications to cosmology .",
    "furthermore , from a practical point of view , once the variational approach is established one can use this method to obtain the optimal parameters for a given family of trial solutions .",
    "let us now describe how to couple a chiral field to the fluid within the framework of the variational principle .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the chiral field , ( [ leff - fai ] ) , should be interpreted as the proper value of the lagrangian where the thermalized quark fluid is at rest .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ l_eff_prop ] ) suggests that the part corresponding to the quark pressure should be replaced by expression ( [ l_eff ] ) in order to reconstruct the fluid motion of thermalized quarks .",
    "apart from the constraints , we have the following action for the coupled system of the chiral field , @xmath18 , and the thermalized quark fluid motion : @xmath70 here , the energy density , @xmath71 , is related to the thermodynamic potential , @xmath72 , through the legendre transformation @xmath73 . since @xmath74 ,",
    "this is nothing but the general thermodynamic relation @xmath75 .",
    "notice that now the energy density depends on the field variable @xmath18 through @xmath76 and , correspondingly , the second thermodynamic law should read @xmath77 the corresponding gibbs - duhem relation becomes @xmath78 where we have defined a new quantity @xmath79 ( with four components @xmath80 ) : @xmath81 the second line corresponds to maxwell s relation and comes from eq .",
    "( [ gibbs - duhem-2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath79 can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83/t}+1}+(\\mu_{q}\\rightarrow-\\mu_{q})\\ ] ] is a scalar density for quarks . here",
    "@xmath84 stands for the color - spin - isospin degeneracy of the quarks , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 plays the role of an effective mass for the quarks .",
    "thus , our coupled system is described by an effective lagrangian @xmath87 the variation with respect to @xmath18 gives the equation of motion for the chiral field , @xmath88 the variation procedures with respect to the fluid variables are almost exactly the same as before , except for the use of the new gibbs - duhem relation , ( [ gibbs - duhem-2 ] ) .",

    "( [ tmunu-1 ] ) and is not the total energy momentum tensor of the system , @xmath92 , which is of course conserved .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ divtmunu2 ] ) contains terms from the pure contribution of the field @xmath93 such as @xmath94 and @xmath95 , both in @xmath91 and in @xmath79 .",
    "however , as we can see from the equivalent equation , ( [ eqm - fluid ] ) , some of these terms cancel out . to see more clearly the coupling between the fluid equation and the chiral field @xmath18",
    ", it may be convenient to identify the fluid contribution of the pressure as @xmath96\\;,\\ ] ] and the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid , @xmath97 then the hydrodynamical motion is written as @xmath98",

    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ vsound ] ) that pressure modes become unstable before chiral modes do .    to study the onset of instabilities within the phase diagram of the low - energy effective model for qcd described previously , we consider two illustrative cases .",
    "the first corresponds to a coupling between quarks and the chiral field small enough for the transition at @xmath129 to be a smooth crossover .",
    "we use @xmath130 , which yields a constituent quark mass of @xmath131mev , about @xmath132 of the nucleon mass . in this case",

    "superheated states correspond to the area on the left .",

    "[ mut-5.5 ] and [ nt-5.5 ] .",
    "as we have mentioned , the difference of this case with respect to the first is that the coexistence line now reaches @xmath129 . because of this",
    ", the spinodals cross each other in the @xmath143 plane , and part of the phase coexistence region can be occupied by both supercooled and superheated states . below the crossing no metastable states exist .",
    "we have shown that the process of domain formation and growth in the phase conversion of strongly interacting matter from a chirally symmetric to a chirally broken state in an expanding qgp is dominated by the exponential increase of hydrodynamical sound - like modes , while chiral - like modes remain stable .",
    "we have mapped the boundaries of the unstable region for two illustrative cases , determining how much supercooling ( or superheating ) is necessary for the onset of spinodal instabilities .    in the case of relativistic heavy ion reactions ,",
    "the short time scale of expansion and effects due to the finite size of the system could change significantly our results . in order to address these points",
