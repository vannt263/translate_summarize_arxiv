    "the sus have to sense for the presence of primary ( licensed ) users ( pus ) on the targeted spectral bands before utilizing these radio resources .",
    "the pu channel utilization patterns are stochastic in nature  @xcite .",
    "consequently , acquiring knowledge about the pu traffic statistics can improve the performance of su channel selection algorithms , for example  @xcite , and help in achieving more efficient resource allocation , for example  @xcite , in dsa systems .",
    "the multi - channel medium access control ( mac ) protocol proposed in  @xcite is a good example for showing the importance of pu traffic parameters estimation . in the proposed mac protocol , the sus access pu channels opportunistically and sense the presence of pus periodically .",
    "the sensing period for each channel is optimized to maximize the expected throughput by minimizing  ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 1 ) ) which quantifies the sensing overhead ( denoted by ssoh ) and the missed channel access opportunities ( denoted by uopp ) .",
    "the optimal sensing period is derived as a function of the pu traffic parameters , specifically , the mean pu off - time , @xmath1 , and the mean pu duty cycle , @xmath0 .",
    "we show that when the pu traffic parameters estimation error increases , the performance of the proposed mac protocol ( measured in terms of uopp and ssoh ) deteriorates .",
    "the results of the investigation on the impact of the pu traffic parameters estimation error on this mac protocol are presented in fig .",

    "these parameters include the mean pu duty cycle , and the mean pu off - time and on - time . in reality ,",
    "however , dsa systems need to periodically estimate the level of pu traffic before making any decisions on pu channel access .",
    "as dsa systems often can not assume any a priori knowledge regarding the pu traffic parameters of the accessed channels , blind or semi - blind estimation methods of time - domain pu channel occupancy statistics need to be employed .",
    "therefore , the issue of efficient estimation of traffic parameters of the pu , considering analytical models of the estimation process , started to gain attention from the research community .",
    "recently published  @xcite is a good example of a dsa system where the need for the most accurate estimation of pu traffic is essential .",
    "therein , a system which scavenges spectrum opportunities in the range of ( 0,400 ] milliseconds is introduced and implemented on the telosb mote ( ti msp40 microcontroller , chipcon cc2420 transceiver ) operating on a 2.4ghz range wireless sensor network testbed .",

    "was adopted for estimating the mean pu off - time while sample stream averaging was used for estimating the mean pu duty cycle .",

    "uniform traffic sampling was assumed for both  @xcite and  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the authors in  @xcite , using the notion of fisher information , derived optimal traffic sampling schemes for estimating the mean pu off - time .",
    "they argued that for a fixed channel observation window and a fixed number of samples , random sampling outperforms uniform sampling .",
    "however , perfect knowledge of the mean pu duty cycle was assumed . besides , no closed form expressions for the accuracy of the estimated mean pu off - time was derived and different random sampling schemes were evaluated only via simulations .",

    "we need to refer to other studies on pu traffic estimation .",
    "specifically ,  @xcite followed a different approach for estimating the pu channel usage statistics ( i.e. its complete distribution ) by using a combination of statistical distance metrics : kernel density estimation , goodness - of - fit testing ( utilizing the kolmogorov - smirnov test ) , and kullback - leibler distance . to increase the complexity of the problem , cooperation between",
    "spatially separated dsa nodes was considered resulting in node - to - node variances in pu traffic observations .",
    "unfortunately , no closed - form expressions for the pu traffic distribution estimation accuracy were presented .",
    "only a heuristic estimator ( in the form of the algorithm presented in table i of  @xcite ) was used .",
    "the proposed heuristic estimator is based on an example of a utility function . moreover , the impact of spectrum sensing errors was not considered ( however , errors due to fading and propagation characteristics were included ) .    finally ,  @xcite considered the estimation of the pu channel state through randomized channel probing .",
    "these papers modeled the pu state estimation problem as an exploration / exploitation problem and based the analysis on multi - armed bandit formulation .",
    "the difference between these two papers lies in system model assumptions and new features that have not been considered in earlier works on multi - armed bandit problems for dsa , i.e.  @xcite considered spectrum sensing errors , while  @xcite considered pu state / channel fading correlation .",
    "we need to emphasize however that pu state estimation in  @xcite has the following limiting features : ( i ) pu channel state estimation reduces to one parameter only ( on or off time ) , ( ii ) the estimation process requires network feedback , e.g. via ack / nack , and ( iii ) the estimator does not collect statistics on the pu channel usage .      in this work ,",
    "we first consider the problem of estimating the mean pu duty cycle , @xmath0 .",
    "we derive the estimation mse in @xmath0 when sample stream averaging with uniform sampling is used .",
    "we extend our work to include non - uniform sampling as well as weighted averaging with uniform sampling .",
    "moreover , we propose estimating @xmath0 using maximum likelihood estimation under uniform sampling , and derive the corresponding cramr - rao ( cr ) bound which provides a lower bound on the estimation error for unbiased estimators employing uniform sampling . regarding the mean pu off- and on - times",
    ", we derive the cr estimation error bounds for both parameters under uniform sampling , and present the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators .",
    "all of the estimation error expressions presented in this work are formulated as functions of the total number of samples , which serves as a guideline for energy - constrained applications where the energy budget for sampling , and hence the total number of samples , is limited .",
    "we also quantify the relationship between the estimation error and the length of the observation window .",
    "this is important for delay - constrained applications , and when non - stationary traffic is considered , as it shows the compromise between the delay in learning the pu traffic parameters and the estimation error in the parameters . besides",
    ", the effect of spectrum sensing errors on the estimation accuracy is studied analytically for the averaging estimators , while simulation results are used for the ml estimators of @xmath0 , and the mean pu off- and on - times . finally , we use the resulting expressions to design algorithms for the blind estimation of the pu traffic parameters under a variety of constraints , and compare their performance against the derived theoretical bounds .",

    "<S> accurate estimation of licensed channel primary user s ( pu ) temporal statistics is important for dynamic spectrum access ( dsa ) systems . with accurate estimation of the mean duty cycle , @xmath0 , and the mean off- and on - times of pus </S>",
    "<S> , dsa systems can more efficiently assign pu resources to its subscribers , thus , increasing channel utilization . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a mathematical analysis of the accuracy of estimating @xmath0 , as well as the pu mean off- and on - times , where the estimation accuracy is expressed in terms of the cramr - rao bound on the mean squared estimation error . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis applies for the traffic model assuming exponentially distributed pu off- and on - times , which is a common model in traffic literature . </S>",
    "<S> the estimation accuracy is quantified as a function of the number of samples and observation window length , hence , this work provides guidelines on traffic parameters estimation for both energy - constrained and delay - constrained applications . for estimating @xmath0 , we derive the mean squared estimation error for uniform , non - uniform , and weighted sample stream averaging , as well as maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation . </S>",
    "<S> the estimation accuracy of the mean pu off- and on - times is studied when ml estimation is employed . besides , the impact of spectrum sensing errors on the estimation accuracy is studied analytically for the averaging estimators , while simulation results are used for the ml estimators . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we develop algorithms for the blind estimation of the traffic parameters based on the derived theoretical estimation accuracy expressions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the estimation error for all traffic parameters is lower bounded for a fixed observation window length due to the correlation between the traffic samples . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the impact of spectrum sensing errors on the estimation error of @xmath0 can be eliminated by increasing the number of traffic samples for a fixed observation window length . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we prove that for estimating @xmath0 under perfect knowledge of either the mean pu off- or on - time , ml estimation can yield the same estimation error as weighted sample averaging using only half the observation window length . </S>"
