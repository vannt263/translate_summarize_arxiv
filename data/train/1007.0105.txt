    "there is strong evidence that many luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are surrounded by dust in a torus - like geometry leading to orientation - dependent obscuration of the nuclear region @xcite . despite the general consensus on the agn unification principle ,",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether obscuration is indeed the dominating effect on the observed differences between radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the question remains if every obscured ( type-2 ) agn has a ( type-1 ) agn hidden by a `` torus '' or if some of the observed differences may arise from other effects , for instance different evolutionary states , different star forming activity in the hosts , or different accretion rates .",
    "orientation - dependent effects can only be tested with type-1 and type-2 agn samples matched in isotropic emission .",
    "low - frequency ( meter wavelength ) radio - selected agn are particularly attractive for studying orientation - dependent properties at other wavelengths because the integrated emission from the radio lobes is optically thin and essentially isotropic .",
    "this paper therefore focuses on powerful double - lobed radio galaxies ( type-2 ) and steep - spectrum quasars ( type-1 ) taken from the 3crr catalogue @xcite , a subset of the deeper and larger 3cr sample @xcite .",

    "they probe the intrinsic energy budget of the nuclear regions where the optical / uv radiation from the accretion disk is absorbed by the surrounding dust , which then re - emits the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths .",
    "thus , the infrared might serve as a `` calorimeter '' for the radiative output in the nucleus",
    ". however , while the infrared radiation has the ability to penetrate the obscuring dust , it will still suffer some ( wavelength - dependent ) extinction , which may yield important clues as to the nature of the obscurer itself .    at lower redshift ( @xmath3 )",
    "the large number of radio galaxies compared to quasars is inconsistent with orientation - dependent models ( e.g. , fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",

    "while such studies were vital to establish the unification picture at @xmath4 , some of this work also indicated that on average quasars seem to be a factor of a few more luminous in the infrared than radio galaxies when normalized by their total radio luminosity . to explain this effect ,",

    "the actual rest frame mean values are @xmath23erg / s for the quasars and @xmath24erg / s for the radio galaxies .",
    "first we used the 15@xmath7 m normalization factors to scale the individual @xmath25 values .",
    "then we normalized the average ir seds of each class to have the same average @xmath25 of @xmath26erg / s , which is the mean rest frame 178mhz radio luminosity of the complete sample .",
    "in addition to the spectra , observed photometry at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 16 , and 24@xmath7 m @xcite was used to construct average near - infrared ( nir)/mir seds for the sample .",

    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the observed as well as the interpolated photometry together with the spectra . after transforming the interpolated values into @xmath21 we applied the same scaling factors as for the spectra and then averaged the photometry .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the average spectra and photometry for the radio galaxies and quasars . the combination of the deep silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath7 m and the overall lower flux levels indicate that the radio galaxies on average suffer considerable absorption throughout the entire mir continuum relative to quasars . applying a reddening screen of @xmath27mag to the average quasar spectrum",
    "yields a very good match with the radio galaxy spectrum in the continuum level as well as in the shape of the silicate absorption feature.m and @xmath28 . ] from the mir point of view , this strongly supports the idea that the quasars and radio galaxies in our sample are in fact _ intrinsically identical _ with the former being essentially unobscured while the latter suffer from extinction .",
    "the good match of the average radio galaxy spectrum to the reddened quasar spectrum also implies that the intrinsic radio galaxy spectrum is not flat .",
    "in particular , the average radio galaxy must have silicate emission underlying the absorption feature ( see section [ sec : sil ] ) .",
    "we here assumed a screen scenario where the absorbing material is placed in front of the emitter .",
    "however , in the clumpy torus models which in recent years were able to successfully explain the dust emission in local seyfert galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mir - emitting zone is not located at a single radius but is spread over a range of radii , thus essentially creating a mixed - case scenario for parts of the absorber . in general ,",
    "screen extinction underestimates column density by different amounts at different wavelengths .",
    "in addition , the bulk of the mir emission will originate at moderate depth within the obscuring structure thus suffering ( far ) less extinction than radiation from the accretion disk or from hot dust located near the accretion disk .",
    "thus , depending on the complexity of the geometry , the mean @xmath29 determined from the spectroscopy represents a lower limit and will in most cases underestimate the total column density by a large factor ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    a notable feature in the average quasar sed is the prominent nir bump at @xmath3025  ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this component is , to different degrees , present in the seds of essentially all individual quasars ( fig .",

    "there is some indication that the strength of this feature increases with increasing visible / uv luminosity of the quasar @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the quasars , the radio galaxies show no noticeable 25  bump .",
    "screen reddening the average quasar sed with @xmath27mag leaves an excess for @xmath31@xmath7 m and especially at the location of the nir bump ( fig.[avgfit ] , _ top _ ) .",
    "this feature is either missing in the radio galaxies , or it might suffer higher extinction than the longer - wavelength continuum .    for their larger sample , @xcite found that radio galaxy seds between 2 and 10@xmath7 m are on average consistent with reddened quasars , similar to our result from the spectroscopy at 1016@xmath7 m . because their sample of 3cr objects contains a large number of fainter and higher - redshift sources compared to the sample of 3crr objects studied here",
    ", we performed the same analysis as described by haas et al .  but limiting the objects to our 20 sources . using their approach , it would require a screen extinction of @xmath32mag to match the average 210@xmath7 m seds of radio galaxies and quasars in our sample .",

    "_ bottom _ : quasar sed with the blackbody component representing the 35  bump subtracted and the remainder reddened by a single screen value.[avgfit ] ]    for the discrepancy at @xmath36@xmath7 m , several possibilities can be imagined .",
    "one example is inaccuracies in the mir extinction curves .",
    "different extinction curves show differences in the continuum at @xmath308@xmath7 m and in the silicate feature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an incorrect ratio between continuum and silicate extinction could be part of the problem . however , considering the good fit in the silicate depth and in the continuum extinction for the spectra ( fig .",
    "[ avgfit ] , _ top _ ) , the extinction curve used here @xcite works well at least at longer wavelengths .",
    "moreover , published extinction curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are all similar and equally featureless shortwards of the silicate feature . with curves such as these , it is not possible to match the nir and mir simultaneously in a screen configuration affecting all wavelengths equally .    an alternative solution can be found by including in the fits a separate blackbody component representing the nir bump .",
    "although a solid theoretical foundation for the origin and the properties of the nir bump is still missing , it can be well described as a single temperature blackbody ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the bump comes from dust , the necessary high temperature places this dust component close to the nucleus , and the radiation from this component would have to penetrate a larger dust column than the rest of the continuum emission . assuming a black body component from nuclear hot dust suffers more extinction than the rest of the ir continuum , screen - reddening of the average quasar sed is consistent with the average radio galaxy sed ( fig .",
    "[ avgfit ] , _ middle _ ) , and the derived temperature of the nir bump blackbody ( @xmath37k ) is in the range expected from previous studies in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . the major requirement in this scenario is that the screen opacity for the nir bump component ( @xmath38 ) must be significantly higher than the opacity affecting other components ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "it could also be suggested that the nir bump is absent in most radio galaxies .",
    "subtracting a single - temperature blackbody from the average quasar spectrum before screen reddening the remaining continuum gives a good fit as well ( fig .",
    "[ avgfit ] , _ bottom _ ) .",
    "however , this scenario would imply that there are intrinsic differences between radio galaxies and quasars , where the latter host an additional dust component close to the nucleus .",
    "such a scenario seems unlikely for the majority of the objects .",
    "visible - light imaging and polarization studies show that at @xmath40 , essentially all luminous radio galaxies show the so - called alignment effect @xcite , and much of this emission turns out to be scattered light from a hidden quasar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , at higher redshifts most if not all radio galaxies host a hidden quasar , arguing for the similarity of both types of objects .",
    "this also strongly argues that the main difference between these two types of objects is in the orientation of their nuclear structures with respect to us .",
    "further clues on the nature of the nir bump might be provided by detailed radiative transfer modeling of the seds of the sources ( f.  heymann , in preparation ) .",
    "regardless of the reason why the nir bump is not seen in radio galaxies , the estimated value for @xmath41 changes very little .",
    "that is because it is determined mostly by the ( rest frame ) 1013@xmath7 m slope and secondarily by the ( rest frame ) 8@xmath7 m photometry and hardly at all by shorter - wavelength assumptions or data .",
    "the rest of this paper uses only @xmath35 , and the nir difference does not affect our main conclusions .",
    "a striking feature in figure  [ fig1 ] is the deep 9.7@xmath7 m silicate absorption observed for the radio galaxies .",
    "the long wavelength side of this feature is well measured in the spectra , and the shorter wavelength photometry data confirm the presence and depth of this feature .",
    "the silicates alone provide clear evidence that in the mean radio galaxy , a substantial amount of absorbing dust lies between the mir continuum emitter and the observer .    for further analysis we determined the depth of the silicate feature in the individual objects by fitting the observed spectrum and photometry with an input spectrum reddened by a dust screen .",
    "considering the uncertainties in treating the nir bump component , we limited the fits for the individual objects to @xmath42@xmath7 m .",
    "we again used the extinction curve presented by @xcite and assumed that the intrinsic continuum of every source resembles the average quasar sed , including silicates in emission . in order to parameterize the average quasar sed , it was fit by a linear combination of three blackbodies of variable temperature .",
    "one of these blackbodies was multiplied by the mir extinction curve to include a silicate emission feature we do not assign any physical interpretation to this fit as it was only used to yield a smooth representation of the average quasar continuum .",
    "this smooth continuum was then taken as the intrinsic continuum for the reddening fits to the individual objects .",
    "figure  [ figfit ] shows two examples for our fitting procedure , and the derived values for @xmath35 for all objects are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "as in the radio galaxy average spectrum , all individual galaxy data longwards of @xmath303@xmath7 m can be fitted by introducing stronger reddening of a nir bump ( or assuming such a component is absent ) . in the majority of cases , variations of the screen @xmath35 with other fit parameters are smaller than @xmath430.1 .",
    "therefore we assign this value as an uncertainty to the individual @xmath35 screen values .    ]",
    "silicates appear in absorption in all radio galaxies and , with the exception of 3c190 , in emission in all quasars .",
    "thus the average spectra accurately represent the two populations . unlike galactic sources , however , the silicate emission feature in the average quasar spectrum peaks at @xmath3011@xmath7 m . such a shift in the peak wavelength of the silicate emission",
    "is frequently observed in agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the assumption that the emission is optically thin ,",
    "the shift can be explained as a result of folding the silicate opacity curve with the ( steeply rising ) black body curve of the silicate grains @xcite .",
    "lower temperatures would then shift the peak of the silicate feature to longer wavelengths .",
    "alternative explanations for the shift of the silicate emission peak wavelength in agn include variations in the dust grain size distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , effects from dust chemistry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or radiative transfer effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the only quasar not showing silicate emission is 3c190 , which shows a shallow silicate absorption feature instead ( table  1 ) .",
    "3c190 also has the reddest mir spectrum of all quasars studied in this paper .",
    "notably , 3c190 is a compact steep spectrum ( css : projected linear radio sizes smaller than 15kpc ) source in the radio , a class of objects which may represent young or frustrated sources .",
    "this class may show different mir properties compared to large double - lobed sources ( p.",
    "ogle , in preparation ) .",
    "however , the two other css sources in our sample ( the quasars 3c186 and 3c287 ) appear very similar to the other quasars in their mir properties , including obvious silicate emission .    the radio galaxy 3c65 stands out by having a very small @xmath35 value compared to the other radio galaxies .",
    "it was also one of the sources where we applied a multiplicative factor to match the spectrum with the higher photometric 24@xmath7 m flux .",
    "as discussed in  2 , pointing errors are more likely to cause an overestimate than an underestimate of @xmath35 .",
    "the observed extinctions can be connected with the orientations of the sources by analyzing the radio properties of the objects ( table  [ tab1 ] ) . due to relativistic beaming effects",
    ", the 5ghz flux of the compact radio core in our objects depends to some extent on the orientation of the radio jet .",
    "therefore the ratio of the radio core flux and the ( isotropic ) extended flux can be used as an indicator of the approximate inclination of the radio source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the radio jet is thought to be oriented along the polar direction with respect to the obscuring structure , one might expect an anti - correlation between the core fraction and the extinction in the optical and mir . ) and the 5ghz total flux taken from @xcite .",
    "we used the observed fluxes and did not apply a k - correction .",
    "] this has been demonstrated to be the case from the optical spectra of quasars which show redder continua ( and larger balmer line ratios ) with decreasing core fraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the core fraction of our objects as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "all sources in this figure with high silicate extinction have weak cores , while most sources with silicate emission show stronger cores .",
    "this supports an orientation - based explanation for the differences between the mir properties of radio galaxies and quasars in the current sample .    ]",
    "while earlier studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that the mir difference between quasars and radio galaxies is consistent with absorption , the actual amount of absorption was still unknown . this necessary piece of information can be derived from the silicate feature depth .",
    "the average spectra in figure  [ fig1 ] already indicate that radio galaxies are _ on average _ less mir luminous than quasars and that this is consistent with absorption . figure  [ fig4 ] shows the comparison for individual objects .",
    "quasars and radio galaxies show considerable overlap in their 15@xmath7 m luminosities , but the depth of the silicate feature separates the two classes almost completely .",
    "radio galaxies occupy a larger range of observed @xmath35 than quasars but with systematically higher values .",

    "[ fig4 ] ]    the characterization of radio galaxies as reddened quasars appears to be in conflict with results at lower redshifts . for objects with strong radio cores , @xcite and @xcite have proposed that beamed synchrotron emission can make significant contributions even at mir wavelengths .",
    "@xcite compared the mir continuum properties of a sample of @xmath4 radio galaxies and quasars also selected from the 3crr catalogue .",
    "they found that , normalized to their 178mhz luminosities , quasars are on average @xmath304 times more luminous than radio galaxies at ( rest ) 15@xmath7 m .",
    "based on sed fitting with a spherically symmetric dust model , @xcite assigned half of this difference to non - thermal emission from a beamed radio core in the quasars while the remaining half was thought to arise from mir absorption in the radio galaxies .",
    "this combination agrees with standard agn unification schemes .    except for cases borderline to flat spectrum quasars such as 3c245 ,",
    "our steep - spectrum objects lack such strong cores , and enhanced mir emission due to non - thermal radiation seems unlikely .",
    "if the mir continuum flux of the quasars in our sample were enhanced by synchrotron emission , they would lie systematically at higher luminosities than the de - reddened radio galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we would not expect the reddened quasars to fit the radio galaxies in both continuum level and silicate feature strength without any corrections for non - thermal contributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , while a non - thermal component at some level is not entirely ruled out , the results for our sample do not require one .",
    "our data set expands the comparison between low and intermediate redshift ( and luminosity ) radio sources to more powerful sources .",
    "a comparison provides new insight on the luminosity dependence of the radio - normalized 15@xmath7 m dust emission .",
    "we calculated @xmath46 for our objects as well as for two comparison samples at @xmath4 and at @xmath3 . for the comparison samples , we used all fr - ii @xcite radio sources in the 3crr catalog observed spectroscopically with _",
    "spectroscopic mir data are available for 42 out of 49 sources ( 86% ) at @xmath4 and for 40 out of 60 sources ( 67% ) at @xmath3 .",
    "we used data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite or retrieved the spectra directly from the _ spitzer _ archive and , after standard data reduction , determined the mir fluxes .",
    "rest frame radio and mir luminosities were calculated in the same manner as for our high - redshift sample using observed spectral indices from the 3crr webpage .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows @xmath47 versus redshift .",
    "plotted versus the redshift @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 , and 15  and 178  mhz refer to rest wavelength and frequency.[fig8 ] ]    especially at lower redshift , a population of mir - underluminous radio galaxies has been found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such objects also have quite different multi - wavelength properties compared to mir - luminous radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they may represent a population of radio galaxies with low ( radiative ) accretion power .",
    "we therefore present the statistics below excluding all the `` mir - weak '' objects with @xmath49erg / s @xcite .",
    "this excludes one source at @xmath4 and 17 sources at @xmath3 .",
    "all three samples at the different redshifts include a small number of css sources . excluding those sources would not affect the statistics in any significant way .",

    "the most striking features of this figure are :    * the @xmath47 of quasars decreases steadily with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "this decline is seen over almost three orders of magnitude in @xmath50 and over the full redshift range ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) covered here . * for the radio galaxies ( excluding the mir - weak sources ) , @xmath59 at low to intermediate @xmath50 decreases similar to the quasars .",
    "however , for @xmath60erg / s / hz , @xmath47 flattens or even increases towards the highest luminosities .",
    "this leads to an apparent @xmath47 convergence of quasars and radio galaxies in the highest luminosity / redshift bin .    in order to quantify these trends",
    ", we divided the objects into four luminosity bins in @xmath50 . for each luminosity bin",
    "we then calculated the mean @xmath61 and the mean @xmath50 for the radio galaxies and the quasars separately .",
    "the results are indicated in figure  [ fig6 ] and summarized in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "these numbers confirm that the ratio of @xmath47 between radio galaxies and quasars changes with luminosity and that there seems to be a maximum difference at a luminosity @xmath50 of a few times @xmath62erg / s / hz , where most sources belong to the intermediate redshift ( @xmath4 ) sample . because the quasars show a fairly continuous decrease in @xmath47 over all @xmath50 ( or @xmath2 ) covered here , the variation in the @xmath47 ratio is probably mostly due to the radio galaxies .",
    "one possible explanation of the trends we observe is that the fraction of the total power emitted by the radio lobes increases with @xmath50 . because for our flux - limited sample an increase in radio luminosity on average translates into an increase in redshift , one could imagine increased lobe power due to ( on average ) denser intergalactic environments at higher redshifts .",
    "such effects , however , should apply to radio galaxies and quasars alike and can not easily explain the @xmath47 upturn for the most luminous radio galaxies .",
    "the apparent @xmath47 decline in figure  [ fig6 ] could in principle be caused by the simple fact of plotting @xmath63 versus @xmath50 , but this again would not explain the rising @xmath47 for the most luminous radio galaxies .",
    "therefore we assume that there is a real physical effect dependent on luminosity and differing for quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "one example of a possible physical effect is that the dust covering angle may be reduced at high luminosities , for example by destroying dust or pushing it farther away from the nucleus .",
    "this would be consistent with the receding - torus model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a decline of @xmath47 with luminosity is expected in such a model if the height of the torus remains constant .",
    "however , the height could be blown up by , for instance , accompanying starbursts , and this could also be correlated with luminosity @xcite . but even in this picture the behaviour in @xmath47 for the most luminous radio galaxies remains a puzzle .",
    "an alternative explanation could involve the effects of additional absorption of the radio galaxies 15@xmath7 m continuum emission by dust in the host galaxy , but outside the torus .",
    "a high dust column density in the host would be required for such behavior . in a situation",
    "where the dust ( including the torus ) is pushed to larger radii due to the increased luminosity of the nucleus , the line - of - sight dust column density in the host might become too small to make significant contributions to the total absorption of the continuum emission .",
    "mid- and far - ir observations of the optically - selected , mostly radio quiet palomar - green ( pg ) quasars indicate that the cold end of the dust temperature distribution of the most luminous pg quasars at @xmath64 is surprisingly warm compared with pg quasars of low and intermediate luminosity @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the amount of colder dust in these ( hyper)-luminous ir sources is relatively small and that the agn effectively heats much of the host galaxy s dust .",
    "if this scenario applies for our high-@xmath2 3crr radio galaxies as well , then the total line - of - sight dust column density may be too small to be able to absorb as much as one would expect from a scaled - up version of lower - luminosity agns , which are located in hosts relatively richer in dust .",
    "in other words , if the agn power relative to the host s dust mass exceeds a critical threshold , the maximum possible extinction declines , hence the ratio of @xmath47(qsr)/@xmath47(rg ) declines as well .    most likely there will not be a single explanation for the observed trends but a combination of effects will have to be considered .",
    "additional insights may come from extending the luminosity range by including _",
    "herschel _ observations of the highest redshift 3crr sources , or by including further constraints from a _",
    "chandra _ x - ray study of the present sample ( b. wilkes , in preparation ) .",
    "four prominent emission lines can be identified in the average spectra ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) : the low ionization [ ] line , the medium ionization species [ ] and [ ] , and the high ionization agn tracer [ ] .",
    "we determined emission - line fluxes only from the average spectra , but their uncertainties still are large .",
    "this is for two reasons .",
    "the individual spectra in which emission lines can be identified show a wide range of emission - line equivalent widths for each type of object .",
    "this dispersion among individual objects leads to considerable uncertainty for the line fluxes in the average spectra .",
    "in addition , the measured emission - line fluxes in the average spectra depend strongly on the placement of the continuum . especially for weak or noisy features on top of a complex continuum ,",
    "this results in large errors . for these reasons , conclusions from the emission lines",
    "should be considered tentative . with these caveats in mind , within the uncertainties the emission line ratios for radio galaxies and quasars are similar .",
    "moreover the line luminosities are comparable as well ( table  [ tab2 ] ) .",

    "this suggests that the mir emission in our objects is strongly dominated by the agn and that any contributions from star formation are small compared to agn emission .",
    "3cr radio sources at @xmath65 also have less star formation than optically or nir selected radio - quiet qsos at comparable redshifts @xcite .",
    "in fact , in most lower - redshift 3cr sources , pah features remain undetected .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that many of the radio sources are hosted by rather quiescent elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the 3crr sample at @xmath66 represents the most radio - luminous steep - spectrum quasars and double - lobed radio galaxies for which the rest - frame mir 916@xmath7 m wavelength range is accessible with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph .",
    "the sample is unbiased with respect to orientation .    *",
    "the quasar seds are very similar to each other in shape .",
    "they show a strong nir and mir continuum , silicates in emission , and an emission bump at 25@xmath7 m . *",
    "the mean radio galaxy spectrum ( @xmath67@xmath7 m ) is consistent with a quasar spectrum reddened by a dust screen of @xmath68mag both in spectral shape and in flux level . *",
    "radio galaxy extinctions indicated by their 25@xmath7 m seds are higher than the extinction derived from the silicate absorption and the ( rest ) 15@xmath7 m flux .",
    "this can be explained if the component responsible for the nir bump in the quasar sed suffers more extinction than the mir emission . *",
    "all sources in our sample with silicate absorption have small core fraction ( @xmath69@xmath70 ) , while objects with silicate emission often show stronger cores .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that the observed extinction in our sample is related to the orientation of the source . *",
    "the average spectra show similar emission - line ratios for radio galaxies and quasars , and no pah features are detected .",
    "this argues in favor of similar intrinsic agn power and star - forming activity in quasars and radio galaxies , as predicted by unified schemes .",
    "* the comparison of our high-@xmath2 sample with lower redshift 3crr sources reveals a steady decline of the quasar @xmath47 with increasing luminosity , and a partial decline , followed by a high - luminosity upturn , of the radio galaxies @xmath47 .",
    "possible explanations for these trends may involve an increased fraction of power emitted by the radio lobes due to different galactic environments at higher @xmath2 and/or different dust geometries due to the higher nuclear luminosities ( e.g distance of the dust from the nucleus , solid angle of the dust exposed to the radiation , or total dust column density on the line of sight ) .    while the mir spectra provide valuable insight into the nature of the mir emission and the relation between the most powerful type-1 and type-2 radio agn , we expect further constraints from _ chandra _ x - ray and _ herschel _ far infrared / sub - mm observations of this sample .",
