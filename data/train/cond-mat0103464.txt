    "using the random - field ising model ( rfim ) we study the dynamics of driven interfaces in disordered ferromagnetic systems by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "the interface separates regions of opposite magnetization and it is driven by a homogeneous field @xmath0 . without thermal fluctuations ( @xmath1 )",
    "its dynamics is affected by the disorder in the way that the interface moves only if a sufficiently large driving field is applied . with decreasing driving field",
    "the interface velocity vanishes at a critical threshold @xmath2 and it is pinned below @xmath2 , due to the random - field .",
    "the field dependence of the interface velocity is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 , i.e.  the pinning / depinning transition can be considered as a continuous phase transition .    for finite temperatures @xmath5 no pinning of the interface occurs since the energy needed to overcome local pinning centers can be provided by thermal fluctuations . in particular for driving fields well below @xmath2 the interface velocity remains finite and is expected to exhibit a so - called creep motion in which the interface velocity obeys an arrhenius law .",
    "this arrhenius law has been found for the edwards - wilkinson equation with quenched disorder  @xcite and we compare these results with those exhibited by a driven interface in the 3@xmath6  rfim .",

    "using simple cubic lattices with antiperiodic boundary conditions we started each simulation with an initially flat interface . in non - disordered systems the interface moves for any finite driving field .",
    "this limiting behavior can be recovered if the interface moves along the diagonal direction of simple cubic lattices ( see for details  @xcite ) . in our monte carlo simulations",
    "the dynamics of the interface motion is given by a glauber dynamics with transition probabilities according to a heat - bath algorithm ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the basic quantity in our investigations is the interface velocity . since a moving interface corresponds to a magnetization @xmath15 which increases with time @xmath16 ( given in monte carlo steps per spin ) the interface velocity",
