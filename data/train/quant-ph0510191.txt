    "in quantum mechanics there is not an operation which would give some information on an unknown quantum state without disturbing the state .",
    "this property of quantum mechanics is closely related to the no - cloning theorem @xcite which forbids to perfectly duplicate an unknown quantum state .",
    "a question that can be risen in this context is which operation allowed by quantum mechanics approximates best this non - existing operation , i.e. which operation introduces for a given information gain the least possible disturbance .",
    "naturally , this operation , conventionally denoted as minimal disturbance measurement ( mdm ) , will in general depend on the set of input states , their a - priori distribution , and on the figures of merit used to quantify the information gain and the state disturbance .",
    "a convenient approach to the problem on finding the mdm was developed in @xcite . in this approach",
    "the classical information gained on the input state from a quantum operation is converted into the estimate of the input state and the information gain is then quantified by the average estimation fidelity @xmath1 , i.e. the fidelity @xmath2 between the estimate and the input state averaged over the distribution of the input states . on the other hand , the disturbance introduced by the operation into the input state is quantified by the average output fidelity @xmath3 , i.e. the fidelity @xmath4 between the input state and the state at the output of the operation averaged over the distribution of the input states .",
    "according to the laws of quantum mechanics for a given set of input states there exists a specific optimal trade - off between the fidelities @xmath1 and @xmath3 which can not be overcome by any quantum operation . in terms of the fidelities @xmath1 and @xmath3 the mdm",
    "then can be defined as a quantum operation which saturates this optimal trade - off .",
    "first optimal fidelity trade - offs and the corresponding mdms were derived in the context of finite - dimensional quantum systems and observables with discrete spectra . to be more specific ,",
    "the mdms were found analytically for a completely unknown @xcite and partially known @xcite @xmath5-level particle and numerically for @xmath6 identical copies of a completely unknown @xmath7-level particle ( qubit ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mdms for a completely unknown as well as partially known qubit were demonstrated experimentally using a single - photon polarization qubit @xcite . besides being of fundamental interest mdm can be applied to increase the transmission fidelity of a certain lossy channel @xcite .",
    "only recently the concept of mdm was also extended into the realm of systems with infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces and observables with continuous spectrum - continuous variables ( cvs ) .",
    "the attention has been paid to mdms on gaussian states , i.e. states represented by gaussian wigner function , realized by covariant gaussian operations , i.e. operations preserving gaussian states which are invariant under displacement transformations .",
    "these operations are advantageous since for coherent input states they posses state - independent output fidelity @xmath4 and estimation fidelity @xmath2 which can be conveniently used for characterization of state disturbance and information gain . within the class of such operations optimal trade - off between the two fidelities as well as the corresponding mdm for the set of all coherent states with uniform a - priori distribution",
    "were derived in @xcite and realized experimentally in @xcite .",
    "in addition , also this covariant gaussian mdm was shown to be capable to increase transmission fidelity of some noisy channels @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address a natural question of whether the covariant gaussian mdm for uniformly distributed coherent states can be improved .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "we show that the fidelity trade - off corresponding to this measurement can be increased by up to @xmath0 if we use a suitable non - gaussian operation thus showing that mdm for coherent states is non - gaussian .",
    "this mdm can be implemented using the standard continuous - variable ( cv ) teleportation protocol @xcite in which the participants share an appropriate non - gaussian entangled state .",
    "further , we demonstrate that our non - gaussian mdm gives a higher transmission fidelity of a certain noisy channel in comparison with that achieved in @xcite . as a by - product",
    "we also derive for the set of all coherent states with uniform a - priori distribution a lower bound for the optimal fidelity trade - off for any covariant quantum operation .",
    "the present paper is inspired by the recent result that fidelity of quantum cloning of coherent states can be increased by using a non - gaussian entangled state @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec_1 ] deals with optimal gaussian fidelity trade - off and corresponding mdm for uniformly distributed coherent states . in section  [ sec_2 ]",
    "we derive for this set of states a lower bound on optimal fidelity trade - off for any covariant quantum operation .",
    "section  [ sec_3 ] is dedicated to implementation of a quantum operation saturating this bound and its application .",
    "section  [ sec_4 ] contains conclusions .",
    "the gaussian mdm can be realized by at least three ways @xcite encompassing the asymmetric cloning followed by a joint measurement , a linear - optical scheme with a feed forward or by the standard cv teleportation protocol proposed by braunstein and kimble ( bk ) @xcite and demonstrated experimentally in @xcite . with respect to what follows it",
    "is convenient to start with the implementation of the gaussian mdm via bk teleportation protocol .",
    "here we use an optical notation in which cv systems are realized by single modes of an optical field and the role of cvs is played by quadratures @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] ) of these modes .    in the bk protocol an unknown coherent state @xmath11 of a mode `` in ''",
    "is teleported by sender alice ( @xmath12 ) to receiver bob ( @xmath13 ) . in each run of the protocol",
    ", the state is chosen randomly with uniform distribution from the set of all coherent states .",
    "initially , alice and bob share a two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state which is a gaussian entangled state of two optical modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 described in the fock basis as @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the squeezing parameter ) .",
    "then , alice performs the so called bell measurement that consists of superimposing of modes `` in '' and @xmath12 on a balanced beam splitter and subsequent detection of the quadrature variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 at its outputs .",
    "she obtains classical results of the measurement @xmath19 and @xmath20 and sends them via classical channel to bob who displaces his part of the shared state as @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as a result ,",
    "bob s output quadratures read as @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for initial vacuum quadratures . since the squeezing @xmath16 is always finite in practice bob has only an approximate replica @xmath27 of the input state .",
    "moreover , for the same reason alice gains some information on the input state from results of the bell measurement that can be converted into a classical estimate @xmath28 of the input state by displacing a vacuum mode @xmath29 as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "hence she obtains @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "quantifying now the resemblance of the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 to the input state @xmath34 by the output fidelity @xmath4 and the estimation fidelity @xmath2 @xmath35 one finds using the latter formulas that @xmath36 expressing @xmath37 in terms of @xmath38 using the first formula and inserting this into the formula for @xmath39 we finally arrive at the following trade - off between the fidelities @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 the obtained trade - off is depicted by dashed curve in fig .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that as one would expect the obtained fidelities exhibit complementary behavior , i.e. the larger is the estimation fidelity the smaller is the output fidelity and vice versa .",
    "interestingly , it was shown in @xcite that if one restricts only to the covariant gaussian operations , then the trade - off ( [ trade - off ] ) is optimal .",
    "it means in other words that the standard bk teleportation protocol with shared tmsv state realizes ( within the class of all covariant gaussian operations ) mdm for coherent states . in the following sections we demonstrate that the optimal gaussian trade - off ( [ trade - off ] ) can be improved by a suitable covariant non - gaussian operation .",
    "we start by a suitable mathematical formulation of the task on finding the optimal fidelity trade - off for cvs . for this purpose",
    "we use a general method developed in @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to coherent input states @xmath41 , where @xmath42 lies in the complex plane @xmath43 , which form the orbit of the weyl - heisenberg group . here",
    "@xmath44 is the vacuum state and the displacement operators @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the standard annihilation and creation operators satisfying boson commutation rule @xmath49=\\openone$ ] , comprise the irreducible unitary representation of this group .",
    "we also assume that the a - priori distribution of the input states coincides with the invariant measure on the group @xmath50 .",
    "the standard bk teleportation protocol can be formally viewed as a trace - preserving quantum operation which is covariant , i.e. invariant under displacement transformations , and which can give as a measurement outcome any complex number @xmath51 ( @xmath52 in the case of teleportation ) .",
    "therefore , we will seek for the optimal fidelity trade - off on this set of quantum operations . to each outcome @xmath51 of such an operation",
    "we can assign a trace - decreasing completely positive ( cp ) map that can be represented by the following positive - semidefinite operator on the tensor product @xmath53 of the input and output hilbert spaces @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite @xmath56 \\chi_{0 }    [ d_{\\rm in}^{\\dag}(\\beta^{\\ast } ) \\otimes d_{\\rm out}^{\\dag}(\\beta)],\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a positive - semidefinite operator . for the measurement outcome @xmath51 the estimated state",

    "since the map @xmath61 is trace - decreasing the output state ( [ rhoout ] ) is not normalized to unity and its norm @xmath62 $ ] is equal to the probability density of this outcome .",
    "the entire operation should be trace - preserving which imposes the following constraint : @xmath63d^{2}\\beta = \\openone_{\\rm in},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 denotes integration over the whole complex plane and @xmath65 is the identity operator on @xmath54 .",
    "for the input state @xmath34 the studied operation produces on average the output state and the estimated state in the form @xmath66 making use of eqs .",
    "( [ covariant ] ) , ( [ out ] ) , ( [ rho ] ) and the formula @xmath67|\\alpha-\\beta\\rangle$ ] one finally finds the fidelities ( [ fidelities ] ) to be @xmath68 ,",

    "we can write @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75 making use of the inequality @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath78 and taking into account the condition @xmath79=1 $ ] which we obtain from the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) using the formula @xcite @xmath80\\openone\\ ] ] following from schur s lemma , one finds @xmath81 to be upper bounded as @xmath82 .",
    "now , if we find a normalized eigenvector @xmath83 of the operator @xmath78 corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue @xmath77 , then the map ( [ covariant ] ) generated from any such @xmath84 satisfies the trace - preservation condition ( [ constraint ] ) as follows from eq .",
    "( [ schur ] ) .",
    "consequently , the map @xmath85 is the optimal one that saturates optimal trade - off between @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the finding of the optimal fidelity trade - off thus boils down to the diagonalization of the operator @xmath78 which acts on the direct product of two infinite - dimensional spaces . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to express the operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the form : @xmath88 which can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) using the formulas @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( re@xmath91 ) .",
    "the present eigenvalue problem can be simplified , if we notice that both the operators ( [ explicitr ] ) and therefore also the operator @xmath78 commute with the operator of the photon number difference @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , the total hilbert space splits into the direct sum @xmath95 of the characteristic subspaces @xmath96 of the operator @xmath97 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath98 .",
    "the infinite - dimensional subspaces @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , @xmath101 are spanned by the basis vectors @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "hence , it remains to diagonalize the operator @xmath78 in the subspaces @xmath104 where it is represented by infinite - dimensional matrices @xmath105 , where @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "we have accomplished this task numerically and the obtained fidelity trade - off is depicted by the solid curve in fig .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates that this trade - off beats the optimal gaussian trade - off ( [ trade - off ] ) ( dashed curve ) . in order to see the degree of improvement better",
    "we have plotted by a solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the dependence of difference @xmath108 between the estimation fidelity @xmath2 in the improved trade - off and the estimation fidelity @xmath39 in the optimal gaussian trade - off on the output fidelity @xmath4 .",
    "numerical analysis reveals that , for instance , @xmath109 is achieved for @xmath110 and the maximum improvement of @xmath111 is attained for @xmath112 .",
    "it should be stressed that we have in fact found a lower bound on the optimal trade - off because we have approximated each original infinite - dimensional matrix @xmath113 by its @xmath114-dimensional submatrix @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) on the @xmath114-dimensional subspace @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) spanned by the basis vectors @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "this follows from the inequality @xmath121 which holds for any @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , because we only calculated the eigenvector corresponding to maximum eigenvalue of matrices @xmath123 ( here we took @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) , the optimal trade - off can be slightly larger than that given by the solid curve in fig .",
    "the above analysis shows that the optimal eigenvector @xmath83 lies in one of the subspaces @xmath104 .",
    "we have a strong numerical evidence that it lies in the subspace corresponding to @xmath126 , i.e. it has the structure @xmath127 comprising the dominant eigenvector of the matrix @xmath128 are nonnegative .",
    "the latter statement follows immediately from positivity of elements of the matrix @xmath78 .",
    "the optimal cp map ( [ covariant ] ) corresponding to the vector ( [ chimax ] ) can be implemented by the bk teleportation scheme in which the tmsv state ( [ tmsv ] ) is replaced by this vector .",
    "this can be shown if we describe the bk teleportation by the transfer operator method @xcite . in this formalism , the action of the bk teleporter with shared entangled state @xmath129 is described by the set of transfer operators @xmath130 , where @xmath131 .",
    "if the input state is @xmath34 and the bell measurement gives the outcome @xmath132 the output state reads as @xmath133 .",
    "the state @xmath134 forming the positive - semidefinite operator @xmath57 describing the considered teleportation protocol then can be calculated by acting with the operator @xmath135 on one part of maximally entangled state @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "this finally gives the state @xmath137 , which coincides exactly with the state ( [ chimax ] ) .",
    "likewise , we can implement the quantum operation which saturates the fidelity trade - off depicted by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for this purpose",
    ", we need to prepare the entangled state @xmath138 where nonnegative probability amplitudes @xmath139 form the dominant eigenvector of the matrix @xmath140 .",
    "apparently , the improvement @xmath141 which can be achieved when using the state ( [ suboptimal ] ) will vary with the dimension @xmath114 of the truncated space @xmath142 .",
    "this dependence is depicted in fig .",
    "we see from the figure that the maximum improvement increases and moves towards larger values of @xmath4 as @xmath114 grows .",
    "it is also seen from the figure that in order to achieve @xmath143 one needs at least @xmath144 . for values of @xmath114 where the improvement @xmath141 achieves at least a few tenths of percent one can calculate the probability amplitudes @xmath139 of the state ( [ suboptimal ] ) only numerically . in order to demonstrate the difference between the state ( [ suboptimal ] ) and the optimal gaussian state ( [ tmsv ] ) we display in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the difference @xmath145 of the schmidt coefficient @xmath139 of the state ( [ suboptimal ] ) with @xmath124 and the schmidt coefficient @xmath146 of the tmsv state ( [ tmsv ] ) for @xmath112 versus the photon number .",
    "the state ( [ suboptimal ] ) can be prepared , at least in principle , using the probabilistic scheme for preparation of an arbitrary two - mode state with finite fock state expansion based on linear optics @xcite .",
    "the specific feature of the optimal state ( [ chimax ] ) is that it possesses perfect correlations in photon number as the tmsv state ( [ tmsv ] ) .",
    "however , there is a sharp difference between the two states , because in contrast with the latter state the former one is non - gaussian . to show this assume on the contrary that the state ( [ chimax ] ) is a gaussian state of two modes @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "such a state is completely characterized by the first moments @xmath147 , where @xmath148 , and by the variance matrix @xmath149 with elements @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 . as @xmath153 for the state ( [ chimax ] )",
    ", it is completely described just by the variance matrix which reads as @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "taking into account the purity of the state , which imposes the constraint @xmath157 @xcite we see that such a state would be a tmsv state ( [ tmsv ] ) with @xmath158 which does not beat the trade - off of the bk scheme and thus we arrive to a contradiction . therefore , the state ( [ chimax ] ) is inevitably non - gaussian .",
    "thus we have found a non - gaussian operation which possesses a better trade - off between output and estimation fidelities than any covariant gaussian operation which implies that mdm for a completely unknown coherent state is non - gaussian .",
    "it can be interesting to compare the fidelity trade - off derived by us with the trade - off that would be obtained when teleporting with the state produced by local single photon subtraction from each mode of a tmsv state .",
    "originally investigated in the context of increase of teleportation fidelity via local operations and classical communication @xcite the state was also shown to be suitable for loophole - free bell test based on homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "the reason for studying the state here is twofold .",
    "first , the state is a non - gaussian state of the form @xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a transmittance of an unbalanced beam splitter used for photon subtraction and therefore it possesses perfect correlations in photon number as the optimal state ( [ chimax ] ) .",
    "second , the subtraction of a single photon was already demonstrated experimentally for a single - mode squeezed vacuum state @xcite . making use of the formulas @xmath161 for the teleportation and estimation fidelities in the bk teleportation with the shared state ( [ chimax ] ) we can find using eq .",
    "( [ subtracted ] ) the teleportation fidelity to be @xcite @xmath162 while the estimation fidelity reads as @xmath163 the trade - off between the fidelities @xmath164 and @xmath165 is depicted by the dotted - dashed curve in fig .",
    "the figure clearly reveals that the trade - off is even worse than the optimal gaussian trade - off ( [ trade - off ] ) .",
    "thus while the single photon subtraction can be a useful method for distillation of the cv entanglement and test of bell inequalities it is not suitable for preparation of a non - gaussian entangled state which would improve fidelity trade - off in teleportation of coherent states .",
    "the non - gaussian operation realized by the bk teleportation protocol with shared non - gaussian state ( [ suboptimal ] ) can be applied to enhance the transmission fidelity of a certain noisy channel .",
    "the channel in question transmits perfectly with probability @xmath166 the input coherent state while with probability @xmath167 the state is completely absorbed by the channel . for the set of all coherent states with uniform a - priori distribution the channel possesses the average transmission fidelity equal to @xmath168 . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that for @xmath169 the transmission fidelity can be improved by using the gaussian mdm in front of the channel while for @xmath170 it is better to entirely use the channel . using the bk teleportation protocol to realize the mdm the improved scheme works as follows . instead of sending directly the input coherent state through",
    "the channel one sends through it one part of the tmsv state ( [ tmsv ] ) . in the next step the other part of",
    "thus obtained state is used for teleportation of the input coherent state . the transmission fidelity for this scheme",
    "is given by the formula @xmath171 , where the fidelities @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given in eq .",
    "( [ fgbk ] ) . by maximizing the transmission fidelity @xmath172 with respect to the squeezing parameter @xmath16",
    "we can reach optimal performance of the scheme when in the interval @xmath169",
    "@xmath173 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the transmission fidelity of the channel can be further improved provided that we use in the bk teleportation the non - gaussian entangled state ( [ suboptimal ] ) ( @xmath124 ) as a quantum channel .",
    "this scheme must be inevitably optimal since within the class of all covariant operations it is designed in such a way that it maximizes the quantity ( [ transmission ] ) which is in fact the transmission fidelity of the considered channel .",
    "the dependence of the improvement @xmath174 on the probability @xmath166 for our scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "the figure reveals that for @xmath175 the scheme really allows to slightly improve the transmission fidelity the maximum improvement of @xmath176 being achieved for @xmath177 . in the region of @xmath178 @xmath179",
    "attains negative values which is a numerical artefact caused by the truncation of the infinite - dimensional matrix @xmath128 to the finite - dimensional matrix @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve @xmath180 also for some @xmath178 we would need to use in teleportation the state ( [ suboptimal ] ) with @xmath181 .",
    "if this is not possible then for @xmath178 it is better to send directly the input coherent state through the channel rather than to use our non - gaussian operation .",
    "thus we have illustrated also practical utility of the studied non - gaussian operation for increase of the transmission fidelity of a specific quantum channel .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that there exists a covariant non - gaussian quantum operation which gives for a completely unknown coherent state a better trade - off between the output fidelity and the estimation fidelity than any covariant gaussian operation .",
    "this means that the covariant mdm for a completely unknown coherent state is non - gaussian .",
    "the non - gaussian operation can be implemented by the standard bk teleportation protocol with a suitable non - gaussian entangled state as a quantum channel and can be utilized to enhance the transmission fidelity of a certain channel . as a by - product",
    "we also derived a lower bound for the optimal fidelity trade - off for a completely unknown coherent state within the class all covariant quantum operations .",
    "our result thus clearly illustrates that one can extract more information on an unknown coherent state while preserving the degree of disturbance introduced into it by this procedure by using a suitable non - gaussian operation .",

    "<S> in standard coherent state teleportation with shared two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state there is a trade - off between the teleportation fidelity and the fidelity of estimation of the teleported state from results of the bell measurement . within the class of gaussian operations </S>",
    "<S> this trade - off is optimal , i.e. there is not a gaussian operation which would give for a given output fidelity a larger estimation fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this trade - off can be improved by up to @xmath0 if we use a suitable non - gaussian operation . </S>",
    "<S> this operation can be implemented by the standard teleportation protocol in which the shared tmsv state is replaced with a suitable non - gaussian entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that this operation can be used to enhance the transmission fidelity of a certain noisy channel . </S>"
