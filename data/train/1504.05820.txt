    "one of the burning questions in nuclear and particle physics is whether massive neutrinos are the majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "the latter must be associated with the phenomena of lepton number violation ( lnv ) , such as the neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath6 ) decays of some even - even nuclei in the form of @xmath7 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the majorana zero modes may have profound consequences or applications in solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "that is why it is fundamentally important to verify the existence of elementary majorana fermions in nature .",
    "the most suitable candidate of this kind is expected to be the massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , the tiny masses of three known neutrinos make it extremely difficult to identify their majorana nature .",
    "the most promising experimental way is to search for the @xmath0 decays .",
    "thanks to the schechter - valle theorem @xcite , a discovery of the @xmath6 decay mode will definitely pin down the majorana nature of massive neutrinos no matter whether this lnv process is mediated by other new physics ( np ) particles or not .",
    "the rate of such a decay mode can be expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the phase - space factor , @xmath10 denotes the relevant nuclear matrix element ( nme ) , and @xmath11 stands for the effective majorana neutrino mass term . in the standard three - flavor scheme , @xmath12 with @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) being the neutrino masses and @xmath15 being the matrix elements of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "given current neutrino oscillation data @xcite , the three neutrinos may have a normal mass ordering ( nmo ) @xmath16 or an inverted mass ordering ( imo ) @xmath17 . in the presence of np ,",
    "@xmath1 is likely to be contaminated by extra contributions which can be either constructive or destructive . while an observation of the @xmath0 decay must point to an appreciable value of @xmath18",
    ", a null experimental result does not necessarily mean that massive neutrinos are the dirac fermions because @xmath19 is not impossible even though the neutrinos themselves are the majorana particles @xcite .",
    "hence how to interpret a discovery or null result of the @xmath6 decay in the foreseeable future is highly nontrivial and deserves special attention @xcite . in this work we focus on the sensitivity of @xmath20 to the unknown parameters in the neutrino sector , which include the absolute neutrino mass scale , the majorana cp - violating phases , and even possible np contributions . beyond the popular vissani graph @xcite which gives a two - dimensional description of the dependence of @xmath20 on the smallest neutrino mass , we introduce a novel three - dimensional description of the sensitivity of @xmath21 to both the smallest neutrino mass and the majorana phases in the standard three - flavor scheme .",
    "we single out the majorana phase which may make @xmath21 sink into a decline in the nmo case , and show that a constructive np contribution is possible to compensate that decline and enhance @xmath18 to the level which more or less mimics the case of the imo . on the other hand , the destructive np contribution is not impossible to suppress @xmath18 to the level which is indiscoverable , even though the neutrino mass ordering is inverted or nearly degenerate . given a discovery of the @xmath0 decay , the possibility of constraining the unknown parameters is discussed in several cases .",
    "we also examine the dependence of @xmath22 ( for @xmath4 ) on the absolute neutrino mass scale and three cp - violating phases of the pmns matrix @xmath23 , and conclude that some other possible lnv processes have to be measured in order to fully understand an experimental outcome of the @xmath0 decay and even determine the majorana phases .",
    "in the standard three - flavor scheme the unitary pmns matrix @xmath23 can be parameterized in terms of three rotation angles ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and three phase angles ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) in the following way @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 ) , @xmath28 is referred to as the dirac phase since it measures the strength of cp violation in neutrino oscillations , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are referred to as the majorana phases and have nothing to do with neutrino oscillations . the phase convention taken in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is intended to forbid @xmath28 to appear in the effective majorana mass term of the @xmath0 decay : @xmath35 the merit of this phase convention is obvious . in the extreme case of the nmo or imo ( i.e. , @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) , which is allowed by current experimental data , one of the two majorana phases automatically disappears from @xmath18 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath28 is intrinsically of the majorana nature because it can enter other effective majorana mass terms ( e.g. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite ) .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath0 decay allows us to determine or constrain @xmath21 .",
    "so far the most popular way of presenting @xmath21 has been the vissani graph @xcite .",
    "it illustrates the allowed range of @xmath40 against @xmath41 or @xmath42 by inputting the experimental values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and allowing @xmath29 and @xmath30 to vary in the interval @xmath43 . in the nmo case",

    "this salient feature enables us to confirm or rule out the imo , if the future @xmath0-decay experiments can reach a sensitivity below 0.02 ev . nevertheless , the vissani graph is unable to tell the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for example , which majorana phase is dominantly responsible for the significant decline of @xmath46 in the nmo case ? to answer such questions and explore the whole parameter space ,",
    "let us generalize the two - dimensional vissani graph by introducing a novel three - dimensional description of @xmath21 .",

    "1 are in order .",
    "( 1 ) the upper bound of @xmath18 is trivial , because it can be obtained by simply taking @xmath55 . ( 2 ) the lower bound of @xmath18 is nontrivial , because it is a result of the maximal cancellation among the three components of @xmath18 for given values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 . ( 3 ) in the nmo case it is the phase @xmath29 that may lead the lower bound of @xmath18 to a significant decline ( even down to zero ) . in comparison , @xmath18 is essentially insensitive to @xmath30 in both the nmo and imo cases .",
    "( 4 ) the allowed range of @xmath18 in the imo case exhibits a  steady flow \" profile , which is consistent with the two - dimensional vissani graph .",
    "its lower bound ( @xmath56 ev ) appears at @xmath57 for a specific value of @xmath52 and arbitrary values of @xmath30 , but a deadly cancellation among the three components of @xmath18 has no way to happen .",
    "( 5 ) when the neutrino mass spectrum is nearly degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath58 ev ) , the results of @xmath18 in the nmo and imo cases are almost indistinguishable .     as functions of the lightest neutrino mass and two majorana phases in the nmo or imo case.[fig : mee_with_all],scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the parameter space for the vanishing of @xmath59 in the nmo case is of particular interest , because it points to a null result of the @xmath0 decay although massive neutrinos are the majorana particles .",

    "there are at least two good reasons for considering @xmath73 : ( a ) only the @xmath0 decay itself can not offer sufficient information to fix the three unknown parameters of @xmath21 ; ( b ) if a null result of the @xmath0 decay is observed , one will have to search for some other lnv processes so as to identify the majorana nature of massive neutrinos .",
    "the typical lnv processes which are associated with @xmath74 include the @xmath75 conversion in the nuclear background , neutrino - antineutrino oscillations , rare lnv decays of @xmath76 and @xmath77 mesons , and so on @xcite . in figs . 3 and 4",
    "the contours for the lower bounds of @xmath73 are presented by gradient colors and their corresponding magnitudes are indicated by the legends . in particular , the purple areas stand for the parameter space where significant cancellations ( i.e. , @xmath78 ev ) can take place .",
    "when the @xmath66-associated term of @xmath79 is not suppressed by @xmath80 , its lower bound becomes sensitive to the majorana phase @xmath30 .",

    "let us try to answer this question in an ideal situation with no concern about the experimental error bars .",
    "the first issue is to derive the correlation between @xmath84 ( or @xmath52 ) and @xmath29 like that given in eq .",
    "( [ m1rho ] ) by eliminating @xmath30 .",

    "for this reason we simply focus on the possible constraints on @xmath29 and @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) in the following .    of course , the value of @xmath64 extracted from a measurement of the @xmath0 decay via eq .",

    "needs the input of @xmath41 .",
    "hence some additional information about @xmath51 from the cosmological observation or from the direct beta - decay experiment will be greatly helpful .",

    "[ fig : mee_m1_rho],scaledwidth=90.0% ]",

( 1 ) has to be modified .",
    "this will make the interpretation of a discovery or null result of the @xmath0 decay more uncertain .",
    "here we aim to study the issue in a model - independent way .",
    "namely , we parameterize the possible np contribution to @xmath113 in terms of its modulus and phase relative to the standard contribution , without going into details of any specific np model @xcite .",
    "an interesting and very likely case is that different contributions can add in a coherent way so that their constructive or destructive interference may happen @xcite . if the helicities of two electrons emitted in the np - induced @xmath111 channel are identical to those in the standard channel , then the overall rate of the @xmath111 decay in eq .",

    "is helpful for us to learn whether there is np beyond the standard scenario , but their different nmes may involve different uncertainties .     as functions of @xmath65 ( or @xmath52 ) and @xmath124 in the nmo ( or imo )",

    "some comments on our numerical results are in order .",
    "\\(1 ) the parameter space in the nmo case can be divided into three regions according to the profile of the lower bound of @xmath128 : ( a ) the region with @xmath131 ev and @xmath132 ev , where the np contribution is negligibly small and thus @xmath126 approximates to @xmath133 ( b ) the region with @xmath134 ev and @xmath2 being still dominant over @xmath124 , where @xmath135 has a lower bound @xmath136 and ( c ) the region with @xmath124 being dominant over @xmath5 , where the lower bound of @xmath137 is simply the value of @xmath124 . if @xmath124 is comparable in magnitude with @xmath2 of the imo case in the standard three - flavor scheme , it will be impossible to distinguish the nmo case with np from the imo case without np by only measuring the @xmath0 decay .",
    "this observation would make sense in the following situation : a signal of the @xmath0 decay looking like the imo case in the standard scenario were measured someday , but the imo itself were in conflict with the  available \" cosmological constraint on the sum of three neutrino masses .",
    "note also that at the junctions of the aforementioned three regions , @xmath135 can be vanishingly small either because @xmath5 and @xmath124 are both very small or because they undergo a deadly cancellation .",
    "\\(2 ) the profile of the lower bound of @xmath137 in the imo case is structurally simpler , as shown in fig .",
    "6 . in the region dominated by @xmath2",
    ", @xmath135 just behaves like @xmath5 in the standard scenario and has a lower bound : @xmath138 on the other hand , @xmath135 will be saturated by @xmath124 when the latter is dominant over @xmath5 . at the junction of these two regions ,",
    "@xmath139 and @xmath122 are comparable in magnitude and have a chance to cancel each other .",
    "this unfortunate possibility would deserve special attention if the imo were verified by the cosmological data but a signal of the @xmath111 decay were not observed in an experiment sensitive to the @xmath2 interval in the imo case of the standard scenario .",
    "while most of the particle theorists believe that massive neutrinos must be the majorana fermions , an experimental test of this belief is mandatory . today a number of @xmath0-decay experiments are underway for this purpose .",
    "it is therefore imperative to consider how to interpret a discovery or null result of the @xmath0 decay beforehand , before this will finally turn into reality .    in this work",
    "we have tried to do so by presenting some new ideas and results which are essentially different from those obtained before .",
    "first , we have introduced a three - dimensional description of the effective majorana mass term @xmath5 by going beyond the conventional vissani graph .",
    "this new description allows us to look into the sensitivity of @xmath5 ( especially its lower bound ) to the lightest neutrino mass and two majorana phases in a more transparent way .",
    "for example , we have shown that it is the majorana phase @xmath140 that may make @xmath5 sink into a decline in the nmo case .",
    "second , we have extended our discussion to all the six effective majorana masses @xmath141 ( for @xmath142 ) which are associated with a number of different lnv processes , and presented a set of two - dimensional contour figures for their lower bounds .",
    "we stress that such a study makes sense because a measurement of the @xmath0 decay itself does not allow us to pin down the two majorana phases .",
    "third , we have studied to what extent @xmath65 ( or @xmath52 ) and @xmath29 can be well constrained provided a discovery of the @xmath0 decay ( i.e. , a definite value of @xmath5 ) is made someday .",
    "it is found that the smaller @xmath5 is , the stronger the constraint will be .",
    "finally , the effect of possible np contributing to the @xmath0 decay has been discussed in a model - independent way .",
    "it is of particular interest to find that the nmo ( or imo ) case modified by the np effect may more or less mimic the imo ( or nmo ) case in the standard three - flavor scheme . in this case",
    "a proper interpretation of a discovery or null result of the @xmath0 decay demands an input of extra information about the absolute neutrino mass scale and ( or ) majorana phases from some other measurements .    in any case",
    "it is fundamentally important to identify the majorana nature of massive neutrinos . while there is still a long way to go in this connection",

    "<S> so how to interpret a discovery or null result of the @xmath0 decay in the foreseeable future is highly nontrivial . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a novel three - dimensional description of @xmath2 , which allows us to see its sensitivity to the lightest neutrino mass and two majorana phases in a transparent way . </S>",
    "<S> we take a look at to what extent the free parameters of @xmath2 can be well constrained provided a signal of the @xmath0 decay is observed someday . </S>",
    "<S> to fully explore lepton number violation , all the six effective majorana mass terms @xmath3 ( for @xmath4 ) are calculated and their lower bounds are illustrated with the two - dimensional contour figures . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of possible new physics on the @xmath0 decay is also discussed in a model - independent way . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the result of @xmath5 in the normal ( or inverted ) neutrino mass ordering case modified by the new physics effect may somewhat mimic that in the inverted ( or normal ) mass ordering case in the standard three - flavor scheme . </S>",
    "<S> hence a proper interpretation of a discovery or null result of the @xmath6 decay may demand extra information from some other measurements .    * how to interpret a discovery or null result of the @xmath0 decay *    * zhi - zhong xing * + institute of high energy physics , chinese academy of sciences , beijing 100049 , china + center for high energy physics , peking university , beijing 100080 , china    * zhen - hua zhao * and * ye - ling zhou * + institute of high energy physics , chinese academy of sciences , beijing 100049 , china    pacs number(s ) : 14.60.pq , 13.15.+g , 12.15.ff + keywords : majorana neutrino , @xmath0 decay , cp violation , new physics </S>"
