    "the icecube collaboration recently reported their detection of 28 neutrinos with energies in the range @xmath5 , inconsistent with the expected atmospheric background of @xmath312 such events at 4.3@xmath1 confidence , and indicating an origin for @xmath360% of these events in cosmic sources ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of these sub - pev cosmic neutrinos can be adequately described by a power law with particle index @xmath6 extending up to a cutoff energy of roughly @xmath7  pev  tev @xcite . ] ; the observed surface brightness is @xmath8ssr .",
    "the sky distribution of the sub - pev neutrinos , which include seven well - localized ( @xmath92  uncertainty ) track - type events and 21 less well - localized ( @xmath915  uncertainty ) cascade - type events , rules out attributing more than a minority of the cosmic neutrinos to a single source ( e.g. , no two track - type events have overlapping localizations ) . in a preliminary analysis ,",
    "the icecube team find that the distribution is consistent with isotropy given their backgrounds and sky coverage @xcite .",
    "however , their search for low - probability event clusters reveals that the single highest - likelihood source position on the sky , with @xmath10 after trials , is located roughly 15  from the galactic center , the result of a cluster of 2 to 7 cascade - type events in this vicinity .",
    "since this location has a natural significance for galactic source populations , and since a population of multiple sources might well extend over multiple degrees along the galactic plane , the icecube point - source @xmath11 value of 8% can be considered conservative with respect to appropriate , astrophysically - motivated galactic source scenarios . given the near - isotropy of the overall event distribution , any such galactic source population will likely account for a minority of the observed sub - pev neutrinos .    in this paper , we explore a single such scenario , first put forward by @xcite .",
    " 2 introduces the class of tev gamma - ray unidentified ( tev unid ) sources and our preferred astrophysical model for these sources , as relatively old ( @xmath12yr ) remnants of galactic hypernovae .",
    "we calculate the flux and spectrum of sub - pev neutrinos expected from the tev unid sources , individually and as a group , and show consistency with icecube observations . in ",
    "3 we explore the expected sky distribution of the sub - pev neutrinos from tev unid sources , and consider how many of the observed sub - pev events can be attributed to this population . in ",
    "4 we review our results , suggest future tests of our hypothesis , and consider the implications of our findings for high - energy neutrino astronomy and high - energy astrophysics generally .",
    "in order to produce high - energy neutrinos , galactic sources have to be efficient cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "supernova remnants are thought to accelerate protons up to at most @xmath9pev energies @xcite , resulting in neutrinos of energies @xmath13pev .",
    "thus , a more promising galactic source population at high energies is the hypernova remnants , which can accelerate protons up to significantly higher energies @xcite by virtue of their systematically greater explosion energies and higher shock velocities .",
    "furthermore , hypernova remnants are likely to have relatively fainter lower - energy photon emission at late stages , making them harder to detect via  and radio observations , and favoring hadronic emission mechanisms .",
    "this set of properties makes them good candidates for the class of tev unidentified ( tev unid ) gamma - ray sources @xcite .    to date",
    ", 24 such tev unid sources have been found within and near the galactic plane and the tevcat online catalog of tev gamma - ray sources at http://tevcat.uchicago.edu/ ] @xcite ; the resolved nature of these sources and their distribution along the plane , with a concentration toward the galactic center , serve to indicate their galactic origin . observed fluxes of the tev unid sources",
    "are typically @xmath14 to @xmath15s  at @xmath16tev .",
    "they show a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath17 to 2.5 at tev energies , and exhibit a typical angular size of @xmath18 to 0.3 .",
    "they are classified as tev unid sources on the basis of strong constraints on their lower - energy (  and radio ) electromagnetic fluxes , e.g. , @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "absence of bright  and radio counterparts disfavors leptonic models , since these require an intense low - energy photon field to be up - scattered into the tev by inverse - compton processes . instead , hadronic models have been invoked for these sources , as we consider here .",
    "first , we show that the flux and spectra of sub - pev neutrinos expected under hadronic models for the tev unid sources can be accomodated within the flux of events observed by icecube . in hadronic models , protons are accelerated by some mechanism and produce pions via @xmath21 or @xmath22 interactions .",
    "a neutral pion decays into two gamma rays with particle energies of @xmath325% ( and total flux of @xmath350% ) that of the parent proton .",
    "thus , the luminosity of non - thermal protons in the tev unid sources must satisfy @xmath23 \\times l_p & \\sim & 2 \\times 4 \\pi d^2 \\ ,     \\varepsilon_{\\gamma } \\ , f_{\\varepsilon_{\\gamma } } \\ , n_{\\rm unid }     \\nonumber \\\\     ~~ & \\sim & 2 \\times 10^{35\\mbox{--}36 } ( d/{10 \\rm \\ kpc})^2 ( n_{\\rm       unid}/10 ) \\rm \\ erg \\ s^{-1 } \\",
    "galaxy^{-1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 is the typical distance to the tev unid sources , and @xmath26 is the effective optical depth for @xmath21 or @xmath22 interactions .",
    "one can see that the required luminosity is much smaller than that of supernovae , @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , which indicates that the sources are significantly more rare .",
    "the observed tev gamma - ray spectra from tev unid sources can be explained if the proton spectrum extends up to @xmath29 to 100  tev .    charged pions , on the other hand , ultimately decay into @xmath30 and muon and electron neutrinos .",
    "resulting neutrino particle energies are typically @xmath35% ( and total neutrino flux , @xmath315% ) that of the parent proton .",
    "thus , the anticipated tev unid neutrino flux is estimated as @xmath31s  at @xmath32tev .",
    "note that roughly equal amounts of energy are delivered to neutral and charged pions for high - energy parent protons .",
    "if the parent proton spectrum extends up to higher energies with a similar power - law index of @xmath33 , the anticipated neutrino flux at @xmath34tev is @xmath35s , consistent with constraints on a galactic component of the icecube sub - pev neutrinos , given that less than four of them can be associated with the tev unid sources , as we show below (  [ sec : skydist ] ) . in the context of our scenario , an isotropic background of sub - pev neutrinos from the cosmological population of hypernova remnants in star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath36 to 2",
    "is anticipated , as discussed by @xcite , and addressed by us in  [ sec : discuss ] ; the possible spectral break at @xmath37pev implies acceleration of protons up to @xmath38pev in this case . as for any galactic source population , however , the cosmic background will not dominate the galactic foreground without very strong effects providing either local suppression of sources or strong cosmic evolution .",
    "compared to ordinary supernovae , hypernovae exhibit greater explosion energies , @xmath39erg with @xmath40 , but have a substantially reduced event rate , @xmath41 yr@xmath42 galaxy@xmath42 . given that hypernova remnants will have similar ages as old supernova remnants , @xmath43yr with @xmath44 , the anticipated number in the galaxy is @xmath45 , consistent with them constituting a significant fraction of the tev unid sources . following the arguments of@xcite , we consider proton acceleration at the forward shock and inelastic @xmath21 interactions as the production process of the highest - energy gamma - rays and neutrinos .",
    "the non - thermal proton luminosity from hypernova remnants can be estimated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the efficiency of proton acceleration .",
    "after escaping the acceleration region , the non - thermal protons interact with ambient material via inelastic @xmath21 collisions .",
    "since hypernova remnants can be expected to occur in relatively high - density regions having @xmath48@xmath49  with @xmath50 , the @xmath21 interactions may predominantly occur around the hypernova shock .    in the late phase ,",
    "the radius of the shock is given as @xmath51 .",
    "then , the effective @xmath21 optical depth can be estimated as @xmath52 here @xmath53@xmath54  is the cross section for the inelastic @xmath21 interaction .",
    "this is a lower limit , since most @xmath21 interactions will occur outside of @xmath55 , where the weaker magnetic field leads to a low synchrotron brightness from secondary @xmath30 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : unid ] ) , ( [ eq : l_hn ] ) , ( [ eq : tau_hn ] ) , and the arguments in the previous section , hypernova remnants can be a viable explanation for both the tev unid sources and the sub - pev neutrinos if protons can be accelerated up to @xmath56pev .",
    "the angular size of such hypernova remnants can be estimated as @xmath57 , consistent with the sizes of the resolved tev unid sources .",
    "now let us estimate the typical maximum energy of protons from hypernova remnants .",
    "the velocity of the forward shock can be estimated as @xmath58 , and the magnetic field strength at the shock can be estimated as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the efficiency of the magnetic - field amplification .",
    "the maximum possible energy is given by @xmath61 , or @xmath62 and the corresponding neutrino energy is @xmath63 the above estimate is slightly lower than the suggested 1.5  pev cutoff energy of the icecube sub - pev neutrinos ( although see @xcite , who suggest a cutoff at 0.25  pev ) ; however , since the galactic component provides a subdominant contribution to the total flux , this is not a critical concern at present .",
    "we also acknowledge substantial observational and theoretical uncertainties , including the calibration of neutrino energies , and the unaccounted - for contributions from younger or more energetic remnants . given these effects , and the neutrino fluxes calculated for individual sources in  [ sec : skydist ] below , we conclude that hypernova remnants could be the dominant explanation for the tev unid sources and for the possible galactic component of sub - pev neutrinos .",
    "in order to explore a tev unid source origin for a subset of the icecube sub - pev neutrinos , we have carried out a cross - correlation analysis of the tev unid source population with the arrival directions of the 28 sub - pev neutrinos .",
    "we retrieved the names and positions of 28 tev unid or tev dark sources from the online tevcat of wakely & horan , and reviewed the latest publication(s ) for each source to determine their tev gamma - ray spectral properties and predict possible sub - pev neutrino fluxes on this basis .",
    "in the course of this review , we found some source duplication and mistyping , and made the following changes to the source list , reducing it to 24 sources for our purposes .",
    "first , the `` milagro diffuse '' source in tevcat has been resolved into multiple sources by imaging atmospheric erenkov  facilities , and we choose to treat these sources individually rather than as a collective .",
    "second , the source tev  j2032 + 4130 is duplicated as mgro  j2031 + 41 ; we list the properties of this source under the latter designation .",
    "third , ver  j2019 + 407 has been identified with part of the shell of snr  g78.2 + 2.1 in a recent veritas publication @xcite .",
    "fourth , magic  j0223 + 403 , an unresolved source , is likely associated with the 3c66b radio galaxy @xcite , and hence not relevant to the present study .",
    "we present the properties of the known galactic tev unidentified sources in table  [ tab : unid ] .",
    "we provide source coordinates , approximate source size ( if resolved at tev energies ) , differential photon flux and power - law photon index at @xmath64tev , and high - energy exponential cutoff energy if known .",
    "we also give the name of the characterizing facility and the reference for the source size and spectral information .",
    "since we find two discrepant source spectra for mgro  j2031 + 41 , we report both values ; we adopt the argo - ybj spectrum @xcite in the analysis that follows , while noting that the milagro spectrum @xcite yields neutrino predictions that are lower by a factor of two .",
    "only a fraction of the full sky has been imaged to sufficient sensitivity to detect the typical tev unid source from table  [ tab : unid ] .",
    "nonetheless , the present source list should offer a fair representation of our galaxy s tev unid source population , as the galactic plane survey of hess @xcite and cygnus survey of veritas @xcite have mapped out the most likely regions for these sources . in the northern sky  admittedly , not the most critical in the present context  wide - area surveys by the non - imaging facilities milagro @xcite and argo - ybj @xcite exclude the presence of bright uncataloged off - plane tev sources , as well .",
    "for each of the tev unid sources , we calculate the neutrino flux under the hadronic scenario based on its observed tev gamma - ray spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the neutrino spectrum has the same spectral index as the gamma - ray spectrum and extends to @xmath65pev if a cutoff is not observed in tev gamma rays .",
    "since all current sub - pev neutrinos possibly associated with the galactic plane are cascade events , we estimate the expected number of cascade neutrino interactions over @xmath66 from each tev unid source , following the optimistic approach outlined in @xcite ; this is expected to yield a reasonable upper limit .",
    "the resulting number of expected cascade events in icecube for an observation time of @xmath67 days and fiducial volume of 400  mton , appropriate for the present `` contained vertex '' search @xcite , is reported for each source as the @xmath68 column in table  [ tab : unid ] . for northern - hemisphere sources , we also present the neutrino flux prior to accounting for earth opacity effects , @xmath69 .",
    "we determine the 28 individual sub - pev neutrino event types , arrival directions , and uncertainties by reviewing the publicly - available slides describing the discovery of the icecube sub - pev cosmic neutrinos @xcite and the team s preliminary spatial clustering analysis @xcite .",
    "this yields event types ( track or cascade ) and arrival directions with sufficient ( sub - degree ) precision for our purposes .",
    "localization uncertainties for cascade - type events are substantial , vary on an event by event basis with the deposited energy in the detector , and will have a significant effect on our analysis .",
    "we do not have access to individual event energies or uncertainties ; however , collaboration slides addressing localization uncertainties @xcite suggest that for a cascade with the median energy of the sub - pev sample , 80  tev , the 80%-confidence radius is 26 .",
    "since 80%-confidence corresponds to 1.79@xmath1 for a two - dimensional gaussian distribution , we adopt a gaussian with @xmath70 as our localization pdf for each cascade - type event .",
    "this pdf is consistent with a visual inspection of the likelihood map presented in the team s spatial clustering analysis @xcite .",
    "similarly , we adopt a gaussian with @xmath71 as our localization pdf for track - type events , consistent with the known localization precision of icecube for track - type events .",
    "since none of the seven track - type events lie within 13  of a known tev unid source , the details of the localization pdf for track - type events has no effect on our subsequent analysis  all track events must be attributed to backgrounds .    at the observed sub - pev energies , the sensitivity of icecube is a function of declination owing to earth opacity . for the tev unid sources , we account for these effects using the observed form of each source s high - energy spectrum and incorporating earth opacity into the calculation of @xmath72 ( table  [ tab : unid ] ) .",
    "the isotropic cosmic background is also affected by earth opacity , given the observed average spectrum , as illustrated in a slide from the icecube discovery presentation @xcite .",
    "specifically , while sensitivity is roughly uniform over the southern sky , it drops exponentially in @xmath73 over the northern sky due to absorption of high - energy neutrinos by the earth . analyzing their presentation of this effect , the scale length in @xmath73 that we infer is 0.66 ; hence , the experiment achieves 22% of its southern sky sensitivity at the north celestial pole .",
    "finally , among the sub - pev neutrinos are an estimated @xmath74 events due to cosmic ray showers in the atmosphere . given the nature of",
    "the `` contained vertex '' search for sub - pev events , which uses the surface `` icetop '' array @xcite and the outer layers of icecube to veto events , the distribution of atmospheric particles that elude these vetoes is a complex function of declination ( zenith angle ) .",
    "we fix the number of atmospheric events at 12.1 and adopt the icecube team characterization of this background from @xcite .    using the above inputs we model the probability density over the sky for icecube sub - pev as the sum of three contributions .",
    "first , we adopt the distribution of unvetoed atmospheric events mentioned above for the 12.1  expected such events .",
    "of the @xmath316  neutrinos of non - atmospheric origin , @xmath72",
    "are attributed to the tev unid sources , and the remainder are attributed to the isotropic background , modulated by the decrease in sensitivity over the northern sky .",
    "each tev unid source contributes in proportion to its calculated sub - pev cascade neutrino flux at icecube , @xmath68 .",
    "since no track - type events have positions consistent with any known tev unid source , the tev unid probability density map is obtained by convolving the source contributions with a gaussian with @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting map of the tev unid source - associated probability density for sub - pev neutrinos is presented as the grayscale image in fig .",
    "[ fig : skymap ] .",
    "this figure also plots the positions of the known tev unid sources ( green circles ) , with plot symbols scaled according to the square root of @xmath69 for each source ; and the positions of the 28 detected sub - pev neutrinos , plotted as a purple @xmath76 for cascade - type events and as an orange @xmath77 for track - type events .",
    "we calculate the joint likelihood of the icecube sub - pev neutrino positions as a function of the number of events @xmath72 associated with the tev unid source distribution in a one - dimensional fit .",
    "we find a maximum likelihood at @xmath78 which is preferred over the @xmath79 null hypothesis by @xmath80 , for an odds ratio of 1.26:1 , without applying any `` occam s razor '' model selection penalty for the added parameter of the tev unid model . since such penalties typically amount to @xmath81 or more , the evidence at present does not rise to a level that would justify rejecting the null hypothesis , and we do not claim that any of the known sub - pev neutrinos originate in any of the known tev unid sources .    however , if our alternative hypothesis is valid , then our likelihood function for @xmath72 can be normalized and interpreted in a bayesian sense as the posterior probability distribution for @xmath72 , assuming a uniform prior over the domain of interest . a plot of this posterior probability distribution for @xmath72 is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevfit ] . in this sense , we find that the posterior probability for @xmath82 is 71% , and that the maximum number of tev unid source - associated neutrinos is @xmath83 at 90%-confidence .",
    "we note that the total number of neutrino cascades predicted for our optimistic scenario ( as provided in the @xmath72 column in table  [ tab : unid ] ) is @xmath84 , compatible with the current observational limit .",
    "we have explored whether , and to what extent , the tev gamma - ray unidentified ( tev unid ) sources within the galaxy might be the source of some of the 28 sub - pev neutrinos recently reported by icecube @xcite .",
    "we reviewed reasoning that suggests some or all tev unid sources may be relatively old ( @xmath12yr ) remnants of hypernova explosions in our galaxy , and calculated the expected sub - pev neutrino emissions of these remnants .",
    "we found that the expected flux and spectrum of these neutrino emissions are consistent with their providing a subdominant , galactic contribution to the total flux of sub - pev cosmic neutrinos .",
    "we used the positions and tev gamma - ray fluxes of 24 known tev unid sources to construct a probability density map for sub - pev neutrinos emitted by these sources , and carried out a maximum - likelihood analysis to explore how many of the sub - pev neutrinos may be attributed to this distribution , rather than the dominant and quasi - isotropic background .",
    "we find that an association of the sub - pev neutrinos with the tev unid sources can not be demonstrated at this time .",
    "however , assuming the validity of our model we find that the maximum - likelihood number of associated neutrinos within the current 28-neutrino sample is @xmath85 , with @xmath82 at 71%-confidence and @xmath83 at 90%-confidence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tevfit ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with hadronic model predictions of the tev unid sources , which give an optimistic bound of @xmath86 .",
    "if our model is valid , we can anticipate detection of further sub - pev neutrinos along the galactic plane within @xmath4 of the galactic center and near the cygnus region at @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skymap ] ) .",
    "while icecube offers the highest - sensitivity coverage of the galactic center , the hotspot in cygnus is at northern declinations where antares and other northern neutrino facilities exhibit greater relative sensitivity .",
    "given the mixing of neutrino flavors from their production sites ( @xmath88kpc distant ) to earth , and the roughly 2:1 ratio of cross - sections for charged vs.  neutral current neutrino interactions with bulk matter , we anticipate roughly 2/9 of sub - pev neutrinos from the tev unid sources to result in track - type events in icecube .",
    "eventually , one or more track - type events must point back to a tev unid source if our model is valid .",
    "given the existence of one years worth of as - yet unreported data , the association of 1.0 to 3.8 of the current sample of events with tev unid sources yields an expectation of at least one track event with a further 4 to 18 years exposure with icecube ( 90%-confidence upper limit ) .",
    "our scenario can also be tested with further tev gamma - ray observations by ground - based facilities including hawc @xcite and the cta @xcite , since we predict the gamma - ray spectra of any tev unid sources that are generating sub - pev neutrinos will extend up to very high energies .",
    "radio and  observations can also continue to test leptonic and hadronic models for the tev unid sources on a case by case basis .",
    "finally , we note that if hypernova remnants are significant sources of sub - pev cosmic neutrinos , their production has been roughly proportional to the cosmic star formation rate and peaked at redshifts @xmath89 to 2 .",
    "hence , in addition to the galactic component associated with tev unid sources , we anticipate a diffuse extragalactic component with a @xmath90 power - law spectrum extending up to a break energy of @xmath31  pev , very like the cosmic neutrino spectrum observed by icecube .",
    "the existence and properties of this diffuse sub - pev neutrino background have been addressed by @xcite ; however , these authors considered only hypernova remnants in ultraluminous infrared galaxies , and found a diffuse sub - pev neutrino flux that was subdominant to backgrounds from gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei . indeed , the dominance of a quasi - isotropic background over galactic sources of sub - pev neutrinos suggests that the dominant sources at cosmic distances are not represented within our galaxy , as otherwise the galactic contribution would dominate by orders of magnitude .",
    "however , as an alternative possibility , we point out that strong cosmic evolution or suppression of the recent galactic hypernova rate  for example , by our galaxy s high metallicity @xcite  will act to mitigate these effects , and enhance the prominence of the cosmic background over our galaxy s contribution .",
    "if such effects are strong enough , then hypernova remnants may even contribute a significant or dominant portion of the diffuse sub - pev cosmic neutrino background that has now been observed by icecube .",
    "the authors acknowledge the critical reading , comments , and suggestions of the referee , j.  f. beacom , which have substantially improved the manuscript .",
