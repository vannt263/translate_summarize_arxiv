    "the sublimation leidenfrost was recently used to put in rotation a disc of dry ice on a textured plate making a genuine turbine @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the sustentation is possible because of a change of phase ; the energy is provided by the plate or by the droplet .    in this paper , we are interested in a third transition which allows levitation , i.e. the fusion .",
    "ice discs were put on a thermalised aluminium plate . while melting , a lubrication film forms between the plate and the disc .",
    "the disc is very mobile and even starts rotating .",
    "we related this phenomenon to the rotation of ice disc at the surface of a thermalised bath and the model we propose here is similar to what was developed in ref.@xcite .",

    "a 2 mm hole was drilled in the center of the plate and allows melted ice to flow out of the bottom of the disc .",
    "this hole avoids that the ice disc eventually floats on its own liquid .",
    "the aluminium plate constituted the top cover of a thermal isolated box ( 375 @xmath0 260 @xmath0 130 mm@xmath1 ) through which circulated thermalised water from a julabo bath thermalizer ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "as the box contained about 10l of thermalised water , the plate temperature remained constant during the melting of the disc .",

    "the large difference between the receding and advancing angles allows to consider that the contact line is well pinned at the surface .",

    "we obtained bubble free ice discs .",
    "the ice discs were placed on the plate .",
    "a dark ellipse ( 50 mm long and 20 mm large ) was put in the center of the ice disc . by image analysis ,",
    "the position of the discs was determined thanks to the detection of the dark ellipse after thresholding the image .",

    "the experimental flow rate is then given by @xmath15 .",
    "the measurements are presented in the inset of fig.2a .",
    "as noticed , the hotter is the plate , the faster the ice disc is melting .",
    "moreover , one observes a maximum in the experimental flow rate which is more marked when the temperature of the plate is high .",
    "this effect is due to the time to establish the liquid film between the disc and the plate .",

    "the mass dependence of the melting rate has been measured for four temperatures ( 5@xmath3c , 15@xmath3c , 25@xmath3c@xmath4and 35@xmath3c ) and this for loads",
    "@xmath5 between 60 and 600 g. the load @xmath5 is given by the mass of the ice disc plus an additive mass .",
    "the maximum and the mean flow rates are reported in fig.2b .",
    "one finds that the flow rate dependence with the load first increases with small load ( until about 150 g ) . for larger loads ,",
    "the melting rate is rather not influenced by the load , except for the highest temperature for which an increase of about 50% of the melting rate is observed .",
    "the rotation speed of ice discs ( @xmath22 g ) was measured as a function of the plate temperature .",
    "the data is reported in fig .",
    "we consider that when the temperature of the plate is 0@xmath3c , the rotation speed is also 0 .",
    "when the plate temperature @xmath2 is increased , the rotation is also observed to increase . such a behavior",
    "is clearly related to the increase of the melting rate with the plate temperature .",
    "in addition , we loaded the ice disc with a petri dish containing lead spheres .",
    "this allows to increase the pressure on the liquid film .",
    "the rotation speed of the ice disc is presented in function of the load @xmath5 ( ice disc mass plus charge ) for a plate temperature equal to 20@xmath3c .",

    ", some dye was added around the melting ice disc .",
    "this experiment allowed visualizing the flow around the ice disc .",
    "the flow around the disc escaped from the plate by the small evacuation hole .",
    "one found that part of the flow rotated in the same direction as the rotation of the disc while the rest of the flow rotated in the opposite direction .",
    "consequently there exists a point of divergence for the flow on the circumference of the disc .",
    "movies are shown in the supplemental materials @xcite    the different observations show that the liquid flow around the ice disc is responsible for the rotation .",
    "this flow occurs in a thin water rivulet bounded by three lines : ( i ) the contact line between the disc and the plate , ( ii ) the contact line between the rivulet and the ice disc , and ( iii ) the contact line between the rivulet and the plate .",
    "the proportion of the liquid rotating clockwise or counterclockwise determines the sense of rotation of the disc .",
    "\\(a )   ( in @xmath3/s ) as a function of the plate temperature .",

    "the liquid film thickness @xmath25 between the ice disc and the plate can be evaluated by considering the heat flux ( by conduction solely ) necessary to melt the ice at the measured melting rate @xmath26 . in a first step",
    ", we took the equation that applies to leidenfrost droplet , namely @xmath27where @xmath28 is the thermal conductivity of the water at 0@xmath3c(=0.55 w m@xmath21 k@xmath21 ) , @xmath29 is the latent heat of fusion of the ice . the melting flow rate @xmath26 has been experimentally found to be equal to @xmath30 where @xmath31 kg k@xmath21 ( fig .",
    "as the temperature is measured in @xmath3c , @xmath2 and @xmath32 have the same value and the thickness is found to be independent on the temperature .",
    "computing eq.(1 ) , one finds @xmath33500 @xmath34 m . another way to determine",
    "the liquid film thickness is to consider the flow description under the ice block .",
    "the mean velocity @xmath35 of the flow at the edge of the ice disc is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the density of the water at 0@xmath3c .",
    "on the other hand , the mean velocity can be also determined by computing the flow under the ice disc in the lubrication approximation . under these conditions , the flow results from the pressure @xmath38 of the ice disc on the liquid film . in the system of coordinates",
    "where the liquid film spreads in the @xmath39-@xmath40 plane and the @xmath41 direction is perpendicular to the ice disc , the lubrication equation reads @xmath42where @xmath43 is the viscosity of water .",
    "the pressure gradient @xmath44 is due to the ice disc weight divided by the basis area of the disc , namely @xmath45 where @xmath9 is the height of the ice disc and @xmath46 the density of the ice , @xmath47 being the earth gravity .",
    "we solve eq.(3 ) under two boundary conditions : ( a ) @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( poiseuille ) and ( b ) @xmath48 and @xmath50 is maximum ( semi - plug flow ) .",
    "one finds @xmath51 where @xmath521/12 ( poiseuille case ) and 1/3 ( semi - plug case ) .",
    "balancing eq.(2 ) and eq.(4 ) , one finds the expression of the liquid film thickness @xmath53{\\gamma \\frac{\\eta_w q}{\\pi \\rho_i \\rho_w h}}\\ ] ] with @xmath54=6 or 3/2 in the poiseuille and semi - plug flow cases respectively .",
    "when the temperature of the plate is increased the film thickness increase as @xmath55 . the relation eq.(5 ) also indicates that the liquid film thickness increases with time as the height @xmath9 of the ice block decreases .",
    "this explains the melting rate @xmath26 ( see inset fig .",
    "2a ) decreases with the time as predicted by eq.(1 ) when @xmath25 increases .",
    "finally , the liquid film thickness is found to be equal to 185 @xmath34 m and 116 @xmath34 m at @xmath1120 @xmath3c@xmath4 for the poiseuille and semi - plug flow respectively .",
    "this contrasts with the approximation of the mean flow rate used to find the liquid thickness from eq.(1 ) . finally , when the thickness of the liquid film is smaller than the capillary length @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 mn / m is the surface tension of the water ) , the ice disc starts floating on its own melted liquid .",
    "the pressure exerted on the liquid film is reduced to zero .",
    "we consider an ice disc rotating counterclockwise with a constant angular speed @xmath24 .",
    "the proposed mechanism resides on the entrainment of the disc by the water flows along the perimeter of the disc",
    ". this flow is constrained in a rivulet that is bounded by the contact lines along the ice block and along the plate .",
    "the viscous entrainment due to the flow counterclockwise @xmath58 is the motor of the rotation .",
    "however , as shown in the experiments , a part of the flow turns clockwise @xmath59 .",
    "the budget between both opposite flows determines the sense of rotation of the disc .",
    "in addition , the friction of the disc with the plate has to be taken into account .",
    "the balance between the motor ( viscous entrainment by @xmath58 ) and the braking mechanism ( viscous entrainment by @xmath59 and friction disc - plate ) determines the value of the constant rotation speed of the ice block .",
    "the angles @xmath60 around the disc are counted positively counterclockwise ; @xmath61 corresponds to the position of the evacuation hole ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the divergence point that separates the counterclockwise and the clockwise flow is located at @xmath62 . for more convenience ,",
    "we define the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the ice disc melts at a rate @xmath18 as found experimentally with @xmath31 kg s@xmath21 k@xmath21 .",
    "the liquid is evacuated out of the ice disc and flows in a rivulet that surrounds the basis of the ice disc .",
    "the section of the rivulet is modelled by a triangle which basis and height are equal to the capillary length @xmath64 .     and",
    "red @xmath59 arrows respectively .",
    "the divergence point is indicated by a star .",
    "the hole is shown in front of the ice disc ( black bullet).,width=302 ]    the hypothesis is that the viscous entrainement of the ice disc by the flow in the rivulet is responsible for the rotation of the disc .",
    "the viscous entrainement is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the thickness of the boundary layer , @xmath67 is the length of the rivulet , @xmath68 the height of the contact between the rivulet and the disc and @xmath69 the speed of the liquid flow . applied to the present case",
    "@xmath68 is proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "the counterclockwise flow @xmath58 flows in the rivulet on a length @xmath70 while @xmath59 flows in the rivulet on a length @xmath71 .",
    "the melting flow rate @xmath26 is distributed among both flows @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "expressed in volume flow , one finds @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the mean velocity of the flow can be deduced @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the surface of the cross - section of the rivulet .",
    "the resulting force due to the viscous entrainement is then given by @xmath77 the friction @xmath78 of the ice disc with the plate is also due to the viscous friction , namely @xmath79 balancing eq.(6 ) and eq.(8 ) , one finds an expression for the angular speed of the ice disc @xmath80 replacing the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath18 , one obtains @xmath83 the angular speed is found to be proportional to the temperature .",

    "this is the solid line .",
    "the agreement with the experiment is satisfactory .    according to this model",
    ", the dependence of the rotation speed with the load @xmath5 can only be found in the melting rate . the reported measurement in fig .",
    "3b shows an increase of the rotation speed . at 25@xmath3c , the rotation speeds is about 4 deg / s for a load of 70 g and is doubled when the load is 300 g. the melting rate measurements are less clear due to the manner it was measured .",
    "however , we can see an increase of the melting rate .",
    "the melting rate 0.6 g / s for a load of 70 g and nearly 1 g / s when the load is 600 g. the relation between the melting rate and the load is not linear .",
    "however , the tendency predicts by the model is rather well respected .",
    "the melting of ice disc on a thermalized plate allows to uncover a behavior similar to leidenfrost effet . the change of phase due to the proximity of a thermalised plate generates a film of the transformed phase .",
    "the block is then isolated from the plate and `` levitates '' on the lubrication film .",
    "we demonstrate that in addition , the ice disc rotates while melting .",
    "this phenomenon has been modelled by considering the flow of the water .",
