    "the possibility of obtaining stable evolutions of relativistic compact objects within the framework of numerical relativity relies crucially on the choice of suitable coordinate gauge conditions . in particular ,",
    "the well - known _ puncture _ approach relies on the gauge conditions to deal with explicit coordinate singularities present in the computational domain .",
    "these gauge conditions are built upon the `` 1+log '' lapse condition  @xcite and the `` gamma - driver '' shift condition  @xcite , and allow the coordinate singularity ( puncture ) to be advected across the grid by the shift  @xcite .",
    "hereafter we will refer to these gauge conditions as the _ puncture gauges .",
    "_    it has been shown  @xcite that , for a single puncture without linear momentum or spin , the wormhole topology of the puncture initial data  @xcite ceases to be resolved by the mesh in the code . instead , the mesh approaches an asymptotically cylindrical stationary , solution , _",
    "i.e. , _ the _ trumpet _ solution .",
    "the puncture gauges can thus be viewed as a sort of `` natural excision '' which squeezes the singularity into an unresolved region of the computational domain .",
    "it is nowadays commonly used in binary black hole simulations by many groups following  @xcite .",
    "the puncture gauges have furthermore been tested in a number of codes solving also the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "it has been found effective in handling the black hole which forms in the collapse of a neutron star  @xcite , and in binary systems in general ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "in particular , it was first shown with three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations that when using the puncture gauges , no special treatment beyond standard artificial dissipation for the metric variables is necessary to follow stably the black - hole formation and evolution .    in this paper",
    "we show that the numerical evolution , with the puncture gauge , of a collapsing spherical star approaches the trumpet solution at late times .",
    "this result is not trivial for a number of reasons .",
    "first , because in the collapsing spacetime , and in particular in the portion filled by matter , there is no time - like killing vector and it is not clear how a stationary end - state can be found .",
    "second , at the continuum level , the two spacetimes are clearly different since , for example , slices in the two foliations have a different topology . even restricting our attention to the vacuum region of the collapsing spacetime and assuming a killing slice compatible with the `` 1+log '' lapse condition , it is not obvious that the resulting slice will be exactly that reported in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the collapsing matter inside the apparent horizon is observed to disappear but it is not clear whether this reflects a physical or a numerical behavior .",
    "we therefore seek answers to the following questions : ( i )  how well do the two endstates agree ?",
    "( ii )  where does the matter go after the apparent horizon is formed ?",
    "( iii )  how do the gauges find a stationary slicing of a spacetime without an explicit time - like killing vector ? in order to address these questions we evolve the spacetime of a star collapsing to a black hole using a `` 1+log '' slicing condition and two variants of the gamma - driver shift condition .",
    "the different results are then compared _ quantitatively _ with the trumpet solution , and spacetime diagrams are constructed to follow the motion of the matter .",
    "overall we find that the two spacetimes tend to a common stationary solution at late times and that this agreement is primarily caused by the shift condition , which pushes grid - points away from regions of high curvature , preventing the matter from being resolved on the numerical mesh .",

    "the latter is developed extending the hydrodynamics solver of the spherical code into the bam code  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we solve the full set of einstein equations in the @xmath0 formalism coupled to general relativistic hydrodynamics ( grhd ) . in our spherically - symmetric simulations we adopt both the bssnok and z4c formulations of the einstein field equations ( see  @xcite for details ) , while in 3d we use only the bssnok formulation .",

    "artificial kreiss - oliger dissipation is added in the evolution of the metric fields following the standard procedure  @xcite .",

    "note that this is compatible with the use of the llf central scheme , which requires only an estimate of the local speed .",
    "unphysical values can be produced in a neighborhood of the center of the collapse , due to numerical errors . in 3d simulations we also found it important to set a ceiling on the lorentz factor @xmath9 in order to prevent the code from crashing after the formation of the apparent horizon .",
    "in particular @xmath9 is set to the ceiling value @xmath10 when ( and only when ) the velocity becomes larger than the speed of light .",
    "simulations employing the excision of the hydrodynamical quantities were also performed . in this case , the matter variables are set to the atmosphere value in a small region well inside the apparent horizon . as expected , no differences were found . in the following we focus on simulations without excision .",

    "[ fig : masses ] , in which the total rest mass normalized to the initial value is plotted in time ( dashed red line ) .",

    "this behavior may appear puzzling since it is geometrically clear that the matter can not leave the foliation ( see _ _",
    "e.g. ,  _ _ fig .  6.11 of  @xcite ) .",

    "indeed , we have experimented with various reconstruction algorithms and resolutions and found that both affect slightly the rate and the initial time of the disappearance of the fluid . more specifically",
    ", more dissipative schemes result in an earlier disappearance of the matter , while higher resolutions can delay it .",
    "however , neither improvement prevents the disappearance of the matter from the grid .    in order to establish whether this behavior is instead due to an excessive stretching of the spatial coordinates generated by the gamma - driver shift condition",
    ", we have performed the same simulations using either a shift gauge speed @xmath6 , or simply setting @xmath69 .",
    "we recall that this is possible since the `` 1+log '' lapse condition is a pure slicing condition , so that the foliation is unaffected by a change of radial gauge ( see for example  @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : masses ] , where we report with the evolution of the total rest - mass ( dashed red lines ) and of the normalized irreducible mass ( solid blue lines ) when @xmath6 . clearly , while the behavior of the irreducible mass is independent of the choice for @xmath33 , that of the rest - mass is not .",
    "when using the @xmath6 radial gauge , in fact , the matter remains on the numerical grid , so that the rest - mass is conserved well beyond the formation of the apparent horizon .",
    "the cause of this difference must therefore to be attributed to the large stretching of the spatial coordinates with @xmath5 . specifically , we identify two effects .",
    "firstly matter falls inside the innermost grid point as the inner boundary is effectively an outflow boundary for the matter ; @xmath8 starts to drop to the atmosphere value approximately @xmath70 before the stellar surface passes through the innermost gridpoint . at this time",
    ", the areal radius of the innermost gridpoint grows rapidly to approximately @xmath71 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : spctmdiag_rt ] later ) . secondly the effective resolution in areal radius near the time of the stellar surface passing through the innermost gridpoint is approximately an order of magnitude lower than in the initial data .",
    "the stretching is thus so large that the matter `` percolates '' through the grid as the numerical methods are not able to reproduce its steep gradients . as a result ,",
    "the spacetime `` empties '' itself and this explains the very good match with the trumpet solution reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_k_1d ] .",
    "conversely , when @xmath6 , the radial gauge does not distort the grid significantly , allowing for an excellent conservation of the rest - mass on the grid .",
    "note that the latter is not the result of the rather high spatial resolution , but it is simply the result of the coordinate time `` freezing '' induced by the collapsed lapse function .",
    "of course , because the spacetime is not able to remove its matter content , the match with the trumpet solution is in this case much worse and @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "not surprisingly , much of what we discussed so far for @xmath6 applies also when considering @xmath69 .",
