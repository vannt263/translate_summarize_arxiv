    "a recent global analysis @xcite including sno experimental results containing neutral current data of solar neutrino flux , day night effect and higher statistics data of charged current neutrino electron scattering rate , @xcite has disfavoured the well known conjecture of bimaximal neutrino mixing @xcite by considering the solution of solar neutrino problem through two flavour neutrino oscillation scenario .",
    "it has been shown that the best fit global oscillation parameters with all solar neutrino experimental data strongly in favour of the large angle msw oscillation solution ( lma ) of solar neutrino deficit and the best fit result comes out as @xmath4 = @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 = @xmath8 with the value of @xmath9 = 45.5 and g.o.f .",
    "although , the atmospheric neutrino oscillation mixing angle @xmath10 is maximal as observed by super - kamiokande(sk ) @xcite however , the lma solution for the solar neutrino oscillation is best fitted with a considerably lower value of @xmath11 .",
    "if we identify the @xmath11 as @xmath12 and @xmath10 as @xmath13 then the chooz @xcite experiment has also constrained the third mixing angle @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , recent result from neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath0 experiment @xcite has reported the bound on the effective majorana neutrino mass ( by considering uncertnity of the nuclear matrix elements upto @xmath15 and the contribution to this process due to particles other than majorana neutrino is negligible @xcite ) as @xmath16 although , there are several number of literature investigating the implications of the above experimental result , however , the claim is still controversial @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we go optimistically with the result and it is important to note that our analyses crucially depends on the future results of moon , exo , 1 ton and 10 ton genius double beta decay experiments .",
    "if the lower limit of the majorana neutrino mass goes below the value presented in eq.(1 ) , the texture and the model considered here will be ruled out provided there must not be significant changes in the present solar and atmospheric neutrino experimental results .",
    "two parameter texture of neutrino mass matrix @xcite which naturally gives bi - maximal neutrino mixing is disfavoured by the recent sno experimental results .",
    "it needs more parameters in the neutrino mass matrix in order to explain the present neutrino experimental results @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to satisfy the limit on effective majorana neutrino mass the @xmath17 element of the neutrino mass matrix should be non - zero .",
    "all these results need further modification of two parameter neutrino mass matrix .",
    ".1 in in the present work , we consider a three parameter texture of neutrino mass matrix which can accommodate the present experimental results .",
    "these three parameters are fixed by defining a function @xmath18 ( see later ) as the sum of squares of the differences between the calculated values of neutrino oscillation parameters ( with the texture considered ) and the best fitted values of the same ( obtained from different analyses ) and then minimising this function .",
    "we then propose an explicit model based on an @xmath1 gauge group with two additional singlet real scalar fields and discrete @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "neutrino mass is generated in our model through higher dimensional terms , the scale of which is fixed through best fit result .",
    "keeping in mind the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , consider the following texture of the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are all real .",
    "it is to be noted that a more general form of the above neutrino mass matrix is presented in ref.[11 ] from which under certain conditions of model parameters the above form can be obtained .",
    "next , particularly , due to the choice of @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters as real , the above neutrino mass matrix gives no cp violation effects in the leptonic sector .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath17 element of the @xmath23 is non - zero hence , it should give rise to @xmath24 decay .",
    "we will estimate the constraint on the @xmath17 element from @xmath24 decay after fitting the solar and atmospheric neutrino experimental results .",
    "moreover , the above neutrino mass matrix can be generated either by radiative way or by non - renormalisable operators .    diagonalising the above neutrino mass matrix @xmath23 by an orthogonal transformation as @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 we",
    "obtain the following mixing angles @xmath28 @xmath29 and the eigenvalues are @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 furthermore , in terms of these eigenvalues the mixing matrix @xmath33 can be written as @xmath34 @xmath35 we set the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences as @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 the best fit values of oscillation parameters from solar neutrino experiment and atmospheric neutrino experiments are used to obtain the values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "for this purpose , we consider @xmath39 , the difference of the square of mass eigenstates @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the mixing angle @xmath12 are responsible for solar neutrino oscillation and @xmath42 and @xmath13 are responsible for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "a recent global analysis by bahcall et al @xcite of the solar neutrino data from all solar neutrino experiments namely chlorine , gallium , super - kamiokande , sno charged current including the recently published sno neutral current data , shows that large mixing angle or lma solution is most favoured for solar neutrino oscillation .",
    "according to this analysis @xmath43 for our model ) @xmath44 and tan@xmath45 tan@xmath46 for our model ) @xmath47 . from the analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillation data",
    "@xcite we have the best fit values of @xmath48 for our model ) @xmath49 ev@xmath50 and @xmath10 maximal .",
    "this value of @xmath10 has already been obtained in our model for @xmath13 . thus treating @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 as parameters",
    "we can obtain different values of @xmath39 , @xmath42 and tan@xmath46 and compare them with best fit values of those quantities namely @xmath51 , @xmath52 and tan@xmath53 obtained from solar and atmospheric neutrino analysis of data ( discussed above ) to fix @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "to this end we define a function @xmath54 @xmath55 the function @xmath18 as defined above is calculated for a wide range of values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 and the minimum of the function is obtained .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 are given below .",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58",
    "@xmath59 @xmath39 , @xmath42 and @xmath60 obtained from the above values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 and their comparison with the best fit values for @xmath4 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 obtained from recent analysis of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data are shown in table 1 . in order to find out the range of values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 that satisfy the 3@xmath63 limits of @xmath51 and @xmath7 for lma solution ( eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) and ( 2.3 ) of @xcite ) of combined analysis of recent solar neutrino data ( including sno neutral current data ) , we have fixed the value of @xmath20 at 0.028 ( see eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) ) and varied @xmath21 and @xmath22 so that @xmath64 and @xmath60 satisfy the allowed lma solution range mentioned above .",
    "this range as given in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in doing",
    "this @xmath42 remains fixed at @xmath67  the value for atmospheric neutrino solution .",
    "the allowed region in parameter space of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we find that the allowed parameter space is very sensitive on @xmath20 , and there is not much freedom to vary @xmath20 within a wide range .",
    "next , we consider the bound on @xmath17 matrix element of @xmath23 from @xmath24 decay experiment . in the present work , after fitting all three prameters with solar and atmospheric neutrino experimental results , we find that the value of effective neutrino mass comes out as @xmath68 which is marginally at the lower end of the experimental value",
    ". such value may be accidental or may have some deeper meaning however , it is quite interesting to note that the testability of the present texture crucially lies on the future result of the @xmath24 experiment .",
    "we consider an @xmath1 model with two additional singlet real scalar fields and discrete @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the representation content of the leptonic and scalar fields is given in table 2 .",
    "apart from the standard model ( sm ) higgs doublet , the extra singlets considered in the present model give rise to three parameters in the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the charged lepton masses generated in the present model is similar to those in sm . to make the charged lepton mass matrix flavour diagonal we consider a reflection symmetry on the lepton- higgs yukawa",
    "coupling @xmath69 ( @xmath70 = 1,2,3 flavour indices ) as @xmath71 we consider soft discrete symmetry breaking terms ( dim@xmath72 3 ) in the scalar potential of the model , and , hence , none of the vev is zero upon minimisation of the scalar potential @xcite . in the present model , majorana",
    "neutrino masses are obtained through higher dimensional terms due to explicit violation of lepton number . the most general lepton - scalar yukawa interaction in the present model generating majorana neutrino masses is given by @xmath73 @xmath74 and the charged lepton masses are generated through the following interaction @xmath75 all other terms in eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) are prohibited due to discrete @xmath2 symmetry and reflection symmetry mentioned in eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) . substituting vev s of the scalar fields in eqs . ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.2 ) we obtain respectively @xmath76 @xmath77 with @xmath78 from our best fitted results given in eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) which satisfy the lma solution of solar neutrino solution and atmospheric neutrino experimental results , we obtain the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 as @xmath3 = @xmath81 gev , @xmath79 = @xmath82 gev , @xmath80 = @xmath83 gev with @xmath84 = 100 gev .",
    "it is to be noted that although the value of @xmath79 comes out to be greater than the effective scale @xmath3 , the effective coupling is always less than unity due to the factor @xmath20 and the effective coupling is always within the perturbative limit .",
    "apart from the electroweak scale , the present model contains three other mass scales two of which are very near to susy unification scale and the third is little lower .",
    "one of the singlet gets vev at little above the effective scale @xmath3 of the theory .",
    "it has some analogy with the singlets getting vev s between susy unification scale and planck scale in supersymmetric theory .",
    "in view of the results from solar neutrino experiments including recent sno neutral current experiment , results from atmospheric neutrino experiment and chooz experimental results we consider a texture of neutrino mass matrix which contains three parameters . we have considered no cp violation effects by choosing these parameters as real .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle @xmath13 comes out to be maximal and @xmath85 = 0 .",
    "the later satisfies chooz experimental results .",
    "we have fixed the three parameters of the texture considered by fitting the mass squared differences corresponding to solar and atmospheric neutrinos and the mixing angles corresponding to solar neutrinos with the best fit values of those quantities ( lma solution for solar neutrinos ) .",
    "we also find that the best fitted parameters can accommodate very marginally the bound on effective neutrino mass from neutrinoless double beta decay experiment and thus the testability of the present texture lies crucially on the future result of @xmath24 experiment .",
    "we also demonstrate an explicit model based on an @xmath1 gauge group with extended higgs sector and discrete symmetry that gives rise to the texture of neutrino mass matrix investigated along with diagonal charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "neutrino masses are generated through higher dimensional operators at the scale @xmath3 . comparing with the best fitted values obtained",
    ", we estimate the scale of the vev s of the neutral singlet scalars as @xmath79 = @xmath82 gev , @xmath80 = @xmath83 gev and the scale @xmath3 = 3.5@xmath86 gev .",
    "we will further study how such texture can be realized within gut , susygut scenarios .",
