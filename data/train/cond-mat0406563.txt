    "nevertheless , a significant occupancy can be reached within several ten picoseconds .",
    "the reduced capture efficiency is related to a reduced overlap between the wl and qd spectral functions for increasing detuning ( which is mainly because the wl states are weakly influenced by the qd states ) . in comparison to this , the strong interaction between s- and p - states maintains a strong overlap between their spectral functions . as a consequence the relaxation time is less sensitive to the detuning .    in summary , the quantum - kinetic treatment of carrier - phonon interaction explains the absence of a phonon bottleneck in terms of scattering between renormalized quasi - particle states .",
