    "the study of the critical properties of systems subject to quenched randomness is of great interest because of its relevance for many experimental systems .",
    "this is a challenging research area which has been quite active in the last decades .",
    "one has witnessed a growing interest in understanding the effect of randomness ( bond and site disorder ) , since harris showed that disorder is a relevant perturbation in a system undergoing a second order phase transition when the exponent @xmath2 of the specific heat in the pure system is positive.@xcite in this context the two dimensional ising model has attracted considerable interest , since the onsager singularity of the specific heat ( @xmath3 ) makes the harris criterion inconclusive ( for a review , see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "renormalization group studies,@xcite supported by monte carlo simulations,@xcite established that homogeneous disorder is marginally irrelevant , i.e. it does not modify the critical behavior of the system , except for the appearance of logarithmic corrections .    in accordance with the harris criterion , randomness is on the other hand a relevant perturbation for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 potts models .",
    "furthermore , an infinitesimal amount of disorder was shown to turn the first order phase transition of the @xmath6 potts model into a second order one.@xcite numerical estimates of the critical exponents for an homogeneous disorder indeed showed a monotonic increase of the magnetization exponent @xmath7 with the value @xmath0 while the thermal exponent @xmath8 remains constant within numerical accuracy.@xcite thus for the two dimensional classical potts model , _ homogeneous _ disorder gives rise to several different universality classes dependent on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "other systems with quenched randomness which have been investigated in the past years are quantum spin chains .",
    "the interest in these models has grown considerably after a remarkable paper of fisher  @xcite who derived many of the critical properties of the random transverse ising chain ( rtic ) using a real space renormalization - group scheme which is claimed to be asymptotically exact .",
    "his predictions were checked numerically by several authors , using the mapping of the rtic onto a free fermion model,@xcite density - matrix renormalization group  @xcite ( dmrg ) or quantum monte carlo.@xcite critical exponents calculated numerically were found in good agreement with fisher s results .",
    "the renormalization scheme of fisher was also applied to the @xmath0-state disordered potts chain by senthil and majumdar;@xcite they found that the critical behavior does not depend on @xmath0 , therefore all critical exponents should be identical to those of the rtic obtained by fisher and corresponding to the case @xmath9 .",
    "we recall that the disordered quantum potts chain is equivalent to a two dimensional classical potts model with _ correlated _ disorder ( analogous to the mccoy - wu model  @xcite corresponding to @xmath9 ) , where the quantum formulation is obtained from the classical one in the extreme anisotropic limit.@xcite the conclusion of a unique universality class is thus different from what found in the classical potts model with homogeneous disorder discussed above .    in this paper , we check the predictions of a unique universality class , independent of the number of states @xmath0 , by studying bulk and surface magnetization properties .",
    "we consider both the regimes @xmath10 and @xmath6 , where the pure model exhibits a second and first - order transition , respectively .",
    "we also report an investigation of the multiscaling behavior of the magnetization , which strongly supports the asymptotic expression for the probability distribution found by fisher in the rtic case .",
    "the dynamical behavior is considered through the decay of the spin - spin correlation function along the time direction .",
    "all numerical results are obtained by density matrix renormalization group techniques,@xcite applied to the two dimensional classical potts model with correlated disorder .",
    "we use nishino s  @xcite version of white s dmrg algorithm,@xcite where one renormalizes classical transfer matrices .",
    "the exponents are calculated from finite size scaling analysis of finite lattice data for chains of lengths @xmath1 with exact enumeration over all possible ( @xmath11 ) disorder realizations , obtained from a binary distribution .",
    "the justification for this type of approach will be presented in more detail in the text .",
    "our numerical results are fully consistent with the conclusion of senthil and majumdar,@xcite i.e. the @xmath0-state potts model has critical properties which do not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , dynamical properties which are not accessible by fisher s renormalization group , do not seem to depend on @xmath0 .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] , the model is presented and we give a justification for the choice of the numerical methods that are used .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) , makes the model self - dual .",
    "the location of the critical point is known exactly:@xcite @xmath18 the strength of the disorder is monitored by the ratio @xmath19 , @xmath20 corresponding to the pure model .",
    "although the dmrg method is capable of dealing with very large systems ( of few hundreds of sites ) with remarkable accuracy , some care has to be taken when working with disordered systems . the infinite lattice version of the algorithm is known to give incorrect results,@xcite especially at strong disorder ; it is _ essential _",
    "@xcite when dealing with inhomogeneous systems to use the finite lattice dmrg algorithm  @xcite which is designed to determine accurately properties of finite systems ( in our calculations we typically used three full sweeps through the lattice ) .",
    "it is furthermore well known that due to the lack of self - averaging,@xcite an insufficient number of samples yields a wrong estimation of the average over randomness and might lead to typical values instead of the expected average quantities.@xcite as we aim to an accurate determination of critical exponents , we have chosen to restrict ourselves to relatively narrow strips ( @xmath1 which turns out to be large enough , since corrections to scaling will appear very small ) for which we were able to do an exact enumeration over all disorder realizations . as the system size is small compared to typical dmrg calculations a limited number of states kept ( @xmath21 ) is sufficient to obtain accurate results .",
    "the setup of the calculation follows ref .  , where the dmrg method was used to calculate exponents and magnetization profiles for the pure potts model .",
    "the @xmath22-symmetry of the potts model has been broken by introducing fixed  free boundary conditions : we fixed the spin at one edge of the system to a value @xmath23 , while at the other edge the spin is free .",
    "this type of boundary conditions induces a finite magnetization in the system  @xcite from which surface and bulk critical exponents can be calculated using finite size scaling analysis .",

    "@xmath35 the approximants scale towards the bulk and surface exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "table  [ table1 ] reports the finite size approximants for the surface exponents for various values of @xmath0 and of disorder ratios @xmath38 .",
    "the extrapolation towards the thermodynamic limit was done using the bst algorithm.@xcite the boundary magnetization exponent , @xmath37 , exhibits a striking convergence for all values of @xmath0 and all disorder amplitudes , but for crossover effects discussed below .",
    "it is clearly independent of @xmath0 , and in good agreement with the rtic value @xmath39 .",
    "the best numerical results are obtained for @xmath9 , as the truncation error in the dmrg method is the smallest for this case , furthermore the surface exponent for the pure and disordered cases coincide for @xmath9 ( they are both equal to @xmath40 ) , therefore no crossover effects are to be expected .    2    we recall that the values of the surface exponents for the pure potts model are @xmath41 for @xmath4 , @xmath42 for @xmath5 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the last exponent has also been recently calculated by dmrg methods  @xcite ( the surface transition is continuous even if the bulk has a first order transition ) . in the case",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , one notices that the approximants approach the value @xmath40 in a non - monotonic fashion ( the same situation occurs with @xmath5 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "this case corresponds to the weakest disorder considered and the non - monotonicity is most likely due to crossover effects from the exponent of the pure system ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "it is not possible to extrapolate the data in the last column of table  [ table1 ] with the bst method , since the largest size analyzed is still in the crossover region .",
    "however we can give an estimate of the exponent using the analysis of the moments presented in section iv b ; from such an analysis we find 0.49(3 ) in good agreement with the value of the rtic , @xmath40 .",
    "we also mention that calculations have been performed at @xmath45 , @xmath48 .",
    "the approximants then do not suffer from so strong crossover effects , an observation which supports the explanation given above .",
    "table  [ table2 ] shows the approximants of the bulk exponent obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) for various @xmath0 and @xmath38 . as it can be seen",
    "the approximants show a non - monotonic behavior , with oscillations which are stronger as the disorder ratio increases .",
    "these oscillations , which were already observed in the rtic,@xcite are due to the choice of a binary distribution of exchange couplings which introduces an energy scale @xmath49 in the problem ; in other types of distributions , e.g. continuous ones , these oscillations are not present.@xcite    lattice extrapolation techniques , as the bst method , are not able to deal with oscillating corrections to scaling .",
    "we recall that the bst algorithm generates from an original series of @xmath50 approximants new series of @xmath51 , @xmath52  approximants at each iteration which are expected to have faster convergence towards the asymptotic value . in the bst analysis we found that even when starting from a monotonic series of data at weak disorder ratios , as in the cases @xmath9 , @xmath26 , the next series generated by the algorithm do not converge at all , but they show oscillating behavior .",
    "therefore the bst method turns out to be useless in the analysis of the bulk exponent data . a better way to get a precise estimate of bulk exponent",
    "is based on the analysis of moments , which will be explained in section [ sec : manal ] .    in any case",
    "the approximants of table  [ table2 ] for different values of @xmath0 are rather close to each other , which supports again the idea of @xmath0-independence of their values .",
    "we recall that for the pure potts model the bulk exponent is @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath44 the bulk transition is first order .",
    "fisher s prediction for the bulk exponent is:@xcite @xmath56    figure  [ fig6 ] shows a log - log plot of bulk magnetization vs. system size .",
    "the data correspond to different @xmath0 and @xmath38 and are all roughly parallel with slopes in the range @xmath57 indicated in the figure and obtained by a simple linear fit . in the scale of the figure oscillations",
    "are not visible and the estimated slopes correspond to the average of the approximants of table  [ table2 ] .",
    "2    0.2truecm    we mention that , surprisingly , we observed a weak dependence of the effective critical exponents with the amplitude of disorder @xmath38 in the range @xmath58 $ ] , while important cross - over effects with the strength of the disorder were observed , e.g. by picco,@xcite in the case of a two - dimensional potts model with a homogeneous disorder .",
    "this is an evidence of the strongly attractive character of the random fixed point .",
    "conformal invariance techniques are extremely accurate for studying second order phase transitions in isotropic pure systems .",
    "conformal symmetry requires translation , rotation and scale invariance ; obviously a single disorder realization does not have such properties , but it is plausible that conformal symmetry is restored after averaging over different disorder configurations .",
    "indeed in recent investigations , conformal mappings of correlation functions and order parameter profiles have been successfully applied in two - dimensional systems with homogeneous disorder.@xcite the case of correlated disorder , studied in this paper , is quite different as the system , even after disorder average , exhibits infinite anisotropy at the random fixed point ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : corr ] ) .",
    "therefore conformal invariance should not hold . in spite of these restrictions ,",
    "the magnetization profiles of the rtic with fixed - free boundary conditions have been quite satisfactorily fitted with the conformal expression,@xcite , obtained e.g. by burkhardt and xue @xcite @xmath59_{\\rm av}={\\cal a}(\\pi / l)^{x_b }          [ \\sin\\pi \\zeta]^{-x_b } [ \\cos\\pi \\zeta/2]^{x_1 } ,      \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 .",
    "the success of such an approach probably results from the geometrical constraints induced by the strip shape of the system combined to scaling arguments : in this sense , if eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) turns out to be valid also for the disordered potts chain , one should conclude that such a form of profile is not a strict consequence of conformal invariance , which does not hold in anisotropic critical systems,@xcite but follows from more general grounds .",
    "0.2truecm    in this section , we indeed ask the question whether eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) correctly describes the transverse magnetization profiles in the random potts chain .",

    "( [ eq10 ] ) holds in the rtic chain when @xmath62 , it should also be valid in the same limit in the potts case .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the same observation was reported for the rtic , but these finite - size effects vanish for the largest systems that can be reached using the free fermion mapping in the ising case . if eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is valid , the quantity @xmath64_{\\rm",
    "av}-      \\ln [   m_l(l/4 ) ] _ { \\rm av}\\over \\ln(\\sqrt 2 - 1 ) }      \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] should converge towards the surface exponent @xmath40 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "this method can not be considered as an exact determination of @xmath37 but it provides an indication of the possible validity of  ( [ eq10 ] ) for this system .",
    "the bulk exponent @xmath36 also follows from a three - point expression analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and should be extracted from the magnetization profile , but our data are not accurate enough to allow this calculation .",
    "according to fisher , the probability distribution of the surface magnetization @xmath65 for a strip of width @xmath66 is expected to behave asymptotically as :    @xmath67    this expression was successfully used for the rtic by igli and rieger to rescale the probability distribution of the surface magnetization for several strips of different widths @xmath66 in ref .  .",
    "the scaling function @xmath68 was found to have a power - law decay in the rtic .",
    "forgetting about the oscillations , the average behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is compatible with this observation .",
    "the results of senthil and majumdar  @xcite state that the scaling function @xmath68 is independent of @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit . here",
    "again , the widths of our strips are too small to give a smooth probability distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "the figure shows that for the events which determine the average critical properties , i.e. those corresponding to the dominant contributions to the magnetization , the probability distribution is weakly dependent on @xmath0 , in accordance with universality of eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) . on the other hand , for the rare samples for which @xmath65 or @xmath69 ,",
    "eq  ( [ eq12 ] ) breaks down .",

    ", as shown in the previous section , hindered a reliable extrapolation of such quantity .",
    "moments analysis was recently used in studies of self - organized critical systems.@xcite it was shown that such method provides an accurate means of investigation of subtle aspects that seem to emerge for such models .",
    "in our case we are interested in the scaling of the asymptotic behavior of the moments .",
    "for instance , in the case of the surface or bulk magnetization we expect : @xmath70_{\\rm av } \\sim           l^{-\\chi ( \\omega ) } .\\ ] ] the exponent @xmath71 generalizes the definitions of eq.([eq6 ] ) , which correspond to @xmath72 .",
    "if the system is self - averaging , we expect a linear dependence of @xmath73 with respect to @xmath74.@xcite at a fixed size @xmath66 , we consider the finite - size approximants of @xmath71 defined as usual by : @xmath75_{\\rm av } - \\ln { [ { ( m_{l-1 }     )          ^\\omega } ] _ { \\rm av } } } { \\ln ( l + 1 ) - \\ln ( l - 1 ) } .\\ ] ] plots of both quantities for @xmath76 and @xmath4 , @xmath77 are shown in fig .",

    "we notice that in both the surface and bulk case @xmath79 for large @xmath66 seems to be a constant independent of @xmath74 ; this constant equals the surface or bulk exponent .",
    "this can be understood if one assumes the probability distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) . as a consequence of this",
    "one indeed obtains : @xmath80_{\\rm av } } =           \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{l } } \\,\\ ,       \\int_0 ^ 1 d m_l^s \\,\\ , ( m_l^s)^\\omega \\,\\ , \\tilde{p }           \\left ( \\frac { \\ln m_l^s } { \\sqrt l } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\      = \\frac{1 } { ( 1 + \\omega ) \\sqrt{l } }       \\int_0 ^ 1 d x \\,\\ , \\tilde{p } \\left ( \\frac { \\ln x }           { ( 1 + \\omega ) \\sqrt{l } } \\right ) ,      \\label{scalgamma }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the change of variables @xmath81 .",
    "we notice from this formula that @xmath74 does not modify the exponent of @xmath66 , but enters only as a prefactor of @xmath82 and consequently all the moments should have the same scaling dimension @xmath83 .",
    "this is what observed in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where the calculated @xmath79 does not seem to depend on @xmath74 , therefore our numerical results are consistent with a probability distribution of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "it is also important to stress that results would have been very different for a probability distribution with another scaling variable , e.g. @xmath84 .",
    "we note that in eq .",
    "( [ scalgamma ] ) , the last integral seems to be nothing but a normalization , but as we mentioned in the previous section the expression used for the probability distribution is only asymptotically valid for the dominant events , and thus the true normalization of the distribution differs from eq .",
    "( [ scalgamma ] ) .",
    "0.2truecm    an interesting consequence of these observations is that one could calculate surface or bulk exponents from an arbitrary value of @xmath74 . from the point of view of the finite size scaling analysis we consider values of @xmath74 where the dependence on the system size @xmath66 is the smallest .    for the data referring to the bulk exponent and shown in the figure",
    "we see that around @xmath85 ( this point is indicated by a thick arrow in the figure ) finite size effects are very small , all @xmath79 seem to intersect into a single value ; for which we estimate @xmath86 in excellent agreement with the magnetic exponent obtained by fisher @xmath87 and also indicated by a thick dashed line in the figure .",

    "we should also stress that , as the system size enters in eq .",
    "( [ scalgamma ] ) together with @xmath74 in the form of a scaling variable @xmath88 .",

    "this can be understood more easily in the classical version of the model and it is due to the fact that disorder along the transfer direction is strongly correlated  @xcite ( layered disorder ) and consequently the model displays anisotropic critical behavior .",

    "furthermore , we have checked the expression of the probability distribution by an analysis of its moments : since the disorder average was exact up to the accuracy of the dmrg method , this computation was allowed even for large moments .",
    "the success of this approach is largely due the occurrence of an optimal moment for which the finite - size corrections appear to be extremely weak .",
    "the method looks promising for further applications to disordered systems .",
    "finally , we have also compared the expression of the dynamical correlation function with that of the rtic .",
    "another interesting feature is the illustration , after the work of aizenman and wehr,@xcite that correlated disorder induces a second - order phase transition in the @xmath109state potts model with @xmath6 .",
    "the universality class is however very robust , in contradistinction with the homogeneous two - dimensional disordered fixed point where the magnetic exponents continuously vary with @xmath0 .",
