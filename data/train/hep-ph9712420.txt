    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix is an assumption which must be subjected to experimental verification by independent measurements of the elements .",
    "non - unitarity of the matrix would be a clear signature for physics beyond the standard model , such as a fourth generation or non - universality of the quark couplings .",

    "assuming that there are only three generations and unitarity of the ckm matrix yields : @xmath8 at the 90% confidence level  @xcite . relaxing the assumption of three generations but maintaining that of unitarity yields @xmath9 at the 90% confidence level  @xcite , while relaxing also that of unitarity leaves @xmath0 unbounded .    in this paper",
    "we describe a new method for the determination of @xmath0 from electroweak loop corrections , in particular to the process @xmath1 . from a combined analysis of data from the lep , slc , tevatron , and neutrino scattering experiments , we determine for the first time the value of @xmath0 , without any assumptions about the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "the implications for other quantities , such as the the top mass , higgs mass , and the strong coupling constant , are discussed .",

    "the only parameters which cause @xmath72 to change by a relative amount of more than 10% , from the original value of @xmath73 , are @xmath42 , @xmath74 , and @xmath60 , which yield uncertainties of @xmath75 22.5% , 19.9% , and 22.4% respectively .",
    "factors of somewhat less than two may be expected from the final analyses of the lep i and slc data samples .",
    "we estimate that the error on @xmath0 from the final @xmath11 samples of the lep and slc experiments will be approximately 20% .",
    "recently cdf presented preliminary results of an analysis of their @xmath76 event samples .",
    "however , they necessarily assumed that there are only three generations and that @xmath77 , as required by unitarity , to extract @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the measurement of the single top quark production rate at hadron colliders should be sensitive to @xmath0 without requiring such assumptions of unitarity .",
    "the estimated sensitivity at the end of the tevatron run ii for @xmath79 is 12%19% , depending on the uncertainty of the gluon structure functions  @xcite .",
    "we describe a new technique for the determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath0 using loop corrections to electroweak processes , without using any unitarity constraints . from a combined analysis of data from the lep , slc , tevatron and neutrino scattering experiments we determine @xmath2 where the error includes the experimental errors and uncertainties on the top mass , the higgs mass , and the strong coupling constant",
