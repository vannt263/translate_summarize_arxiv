    "managing interference in wireless networks has emerged as a challenging and important task over the past decade .",
    "we explore the potential degrees of freedom gains of cooperative transmission in wireless networks through different models for the interference , and under average backhaul load constraints .",
    "in particular , we show that cooperative transmission can be used to achieve significant dof gains without requiring extra backhaul capacity .",
    "we start this work by studying the degrees of freedom ( dof ) in wyner s linear interference network . in wyner s network , introduced in  @xcite ,",
    "interference is modeled by assuming that the transmission of each transmitter is heard only by the receiver that has the same index as well as one succeeding transmitter .",
    "wyner s model , while being simple , allows us to obtain rigorous conclusions about the optimal schemes for interference management .",
    "further , as we show in this work , the insights obtained through analyzing linear networks such as wyner s network can often be carried over to more complex network models that better approximate practical wireless networks .    our focus on the dof criterion",
    "is justified by the fact that it is useful to capture roughly the available capacity as a fraction of the capacity of an interference - free network consisting of point - to - point links .",
    "two major advantages of the dof criterion are as follows : ( i ) it is easy to analyze , and in many cases , the problem of finding an information theoretic upper bound or converse reduces to a straightforward combinatorial problem ; and ( ii ) it captures the limiting effect of interference without regard to the gaussian noise effect .",
    "the degrees of freedom of a point - to - point link with white gaussian noise is unity , and this is the reference benchmark for any given user s rate in an interference network , i.e. , the per user dof is at most one .",
    "the dof gains offered by cooperative transmission in wyner s linear interference networks was studied in  @xcite , for the special case where each message is available at the transmitter with the same index as well as @xmath2 succeeding transmitters .",
    "the asymptotic limit of the per user dof as the number of users goes to infinity was shown to be @xmath3 .",
    "an asymptotic per user dof of @xmath4 was achieved using a smarter message assignment in  @xcite . in the proposed scheme of  @xcite ,",
    "each message is assigned to the transmitter with the same index as well as @xmath2 other transmitters . however , unlike the assignment of  @xcite , in  @xcite the choice of the @xmath2 other transmitters is not simply the succeeding @xmath2 transmitters . in  @xcite , it is shown that under a cooperation order constraint that limits the number of transmitters at which each message can be available by @xmath5 , the asymptotic per user dof is @xmath6 and is achieved by a _",
    "flexible _ assignment of messages to transmitters where it is not necessary to assign each message to the transmitter with the same index .",
    "the dof gains discussed in  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite are achieved by a simple signaling scheme that relies only on zero - forcing transmit beamforming .",
    "the maximum transmit set size constraint of @xmath5 is not met tightly for all messages in the optimal message assignment scheme presented in  @xcite . in this work , we therefore consider a cooperation constraint that is more general and relevant to many scenarios of practical significance . in particular , we define the _ backhaul load _ constraint @xmath0 as the ratio between the sum of the transmit set sizes for all the messages and the number of users .",
    "in other words , we allow the transmit set size to vary across the messages , while maintaining a constraint on the average transmit set size of @xmath0 .",
    "we establish in this paper that the asymptotic per user dof in this new setting is @xmath1 , which is larger than the per user dof of @xmath6 obtained with the more stringent per message transmit set size constraint of @xmath7 .",
    "the identified optimal scheme relies only on zero - forcing beamforming at the transmitters , and an asymmetric or unbalanced assignment of messages , with some messages being assigned to more than @xmath0 transmitters and others being assigned to fewer than @xmath0 transmitters .",
    "we apply these insights to more general channel models such as general linear interference models and the hexagonal sectored cellular model . in particular , we show that with cooperative transmission and under a backhaul load constraint of unity , it is possible to achieve a greater per user dof than the case of no cooperation ( @xmath8 ) for both linear and cellular networks .",
    "this shows that simple one - shot zero - forcing beamforming combined with non - uniform message assignments can be used to achieve significant gains in the per user dof , while maintaining an average backhaul load of one message per transmitter .",
    "a major advance in the theoretical analysis of interference management in large wireless networks took place with the introduction of asymptotic interference alignment in  @xcite ( ia ) .",
    "ia beamforming relies on signaling over a number of time slots ( _ symbol extension _ ) that goes to infinity in order to enable the achievability of a per user dof of @xmath9 in a fully connected interference network .",
    "however , the gains offered by ia are considered to be infeasible in practice , and a major reason for the infeasability is the excessive requirement on the length of symbol extension , which would lead to impractical delays .",
    "an important aspect of this work is that we show that the promised gains of interference alignment can be achieved with one - shot coding schemes that do not require symbol extension , if we consider more practical network models than the fully connected model and allow for cooperative transmission , even without requiring additional overall load on the supporting backhaul .",
    "degrees of freedom gains in the hexagonal cellular downlink using cooperative transmission was considered in @xcite , where the transmitting basestations cooperate by exchanging quantized dirty paper coded signals . however , implementing such a scheme can face practical challenges as each transmitter gets its message only after a series of preceding transmitters have encoded their messages ; this will require either significant delay or coding over multiple time slots .",
    "further , under this setting , the only way for messages to be delivered to transmitters through a centralized controller , is for the controller to be aware of the channel state information .",
    "we describe the system model in section  [ sec : systemmodel ] , and characterize the degrees of freedom for the wyner linear network in section [ sec : wyner ] .",
    "we extend the results to the linear locally connected channel model in section [ sec : local ] , and to the hexagonal cellular network in section [ sec : hexa ] .",
    "finally , we provide concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we use the standard model for the @xmath10-user interference channel with single - antenna transmitters and receivers , @xmath11    where @xmath12 denotes the signal transmitted by transmitter @xmath13 under an average transmit power constraint , @xmath14 denotes the additive white gaussian noise at receiver @xmath15 , @xmath16 denotes the channel gain coefficient from transmitter @xmath13 to receiver @xmath15 , and @xmath17 denotes the set of interferers at receiver @xmath15 ( neighbors in the connectivity graph ) .",
    "all channel coefficients that are not identically zero are assumed to be drawn from a continuous joint distribution .",
    "finally , it is assumed that global channel state information is available at all transmitters and receivers .        in this channel model , each transmitter is connected to its corresponding receiver as well as one following receiver , and the last transmitter is only connected to its corresponding receiver .",

    "it is assumed that the sectors belonging to the same cell do not interfere with each other , the justification being that the interference power due to sectors in the same cell is usually far lower than the interference from out - of - cell users located in the sector s line of sight .",

    "<S> degrees of freedom ( dof ) gains are studied in wireless networks with cooperative transmission under a _ backhaul load _ constraint that limits the average number of messages that can be delivered from a centralized controller to the basestation transmitters . </S>",
    "<S> the backhaul load is defined as the sum of all the messages available at all the transmitters per channel use , normalized by the number of users . for wyner s linear interference network , where each transmitter is connected to the receiver having the same index as well as one succeeding receiver , </S>",
    "<S> the per user dof is characterized and the optimal scheme is presented . </S>",
    "<S> when the backhaul load is constrained to an integer level @xmath0 , the asymptotic per user dof is shown to equal @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is shown that the optimal assignment of messages to transmitters is asymmetric and satisfies a local cooperation constraint , and that the optimal coding scheme relies only on one - shot zero - forcing transmit beamforming . </S>",
    "<S> the results are then extended to locally connected linear interference networks and the more practical hexagonal sectored cellular networks . </S>",
    "<S> our main conclusion for all the studied network models is that by allowing for cooperative transmission and a flexible message assignment that is constrained only by an average backhaul load , one can deliver the rate gains promised by information - theoretic upper bounds with practical one - shot schemes that incur little or no additional load on the backhaul . </S>"
