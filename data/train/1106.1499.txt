    "we adapt the convention that the trivial group @xmath5 is _ not _ left - orderable .",

    "let @xmath8 be the double branched covering of @xmath6 . in this paper we study the non - existence of left orderings of @xmath9 , the fundamental group of the double branched covering .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a new method to show @xmath9 is _ not _ left - orderable , by introducing a new notion called a _",
    "coarse presentation_.    a coarse presentation is a generalization of a group presentation . like a usual group presentation ,",
    "a coarse presentation is given as a set of generators and a set of relations .",
    "the main difference is that a coarse presentation allows to include _ inequalities _ as its relations .",
    "we construct a coarse presentation associated to a link diagram @xmath10 which we will call the _ coarse brunner s presentation_. based on the coarse brunner s presentation , we will give various families of links whose double branched covering has non - left - orderable fundamental group . in theorem",
    "[ thm : simalter ] , we will treat links represented by diagrams which is similar to alternating link diagrams in the coarse presentation point of view .",
    "this family of links contains all alternating links , hence extends the results obtained in @xcite,@xcite : the double branched covering of an alternating link has the non - left - orderable fundamental group .",
    "we will also treat various non - alternating links as well . in theorem",
    "[ thm : main ] and theorem [ thm : main2 ] , we will show that the double branched covering of links represented by some particular diagrams have the non - left - orderable fundamental group .",
    "these family of links contain all positive knots of genus two and many non - alternating links .",
    "the reader should regard these theorems rather as examples of coarse presentation arguments . in a similar manner ,",
    "the coarse presentation allows us to find a lot of other examples of links whose branched double covering have non - left - orderable fundamental groups .",
    "although it is possible to prove all results in this paper by using the usual group presentations , the coarse presentation argument has several benefits .",
    "first of all , the coarse presentation is much simpler than the usual group presentation : it has less generators and less relations than the usual group presentation . in particular , by using coarse presentation , the proof of non - left - ordrability becomes much simpler compared with the proof based on the usual group presentation . moreover , in the proof of non - left - orderability , the coarse presentation allows us to separate the role of the link diagrams into the _ local _ properties and the _ global _ properties .",
    "that is , our arguments of non - left - orderability are valid if we replace a crossing with an ( algebraic ) tangle which has a property similar to the original crossing .",
    "thus the coarse presentation argument provides more unified point of view in the proof of non - left - orderability .",
    "let us sketch here a main idea of the coarse presentation argument .",
    "let @xmath10 be a diagram representing a link @xmath6 . in @xcite",
    ", brunner constructed a presentation of @xmath9 from the diagram @xmath10 .",
    "this presentation has a lot of generators and relations .",
    "we try to extract essential information which is sufficient to show @xmath9 is not left - orderable .    for an algebraic tangle @xmath11 in the diagram @xmath10 , we associate special elements @xmath12 of @xmath9 , which will serve as generators of the coarse presentation . by studying brunner s presentation of @xmath9 precisely , we find the commutative relation @xmath13 and an inequality @xmath14 which are valid for _ all _ left orderings of @xmath9",
    ". we will express this commutative relation and  universal \" inequalities by @xmath15_{l^{-1}r}$ ] . this ",
    "universal \" inequality is obtained from only the tangle diagram @xmath11 .",
    "this is what we referred as the  local properties \" .",
    "the coarse presentation is a collection of a set of generators , a set of  universal \" inequalities , and a set of relations given as usual equalities , which corresponds to what we referred as the  global properties \" .",
    "the usual equalities describe how algebraic tangles are connected in the whole link diagram .",
    "these two kinds of information allow us to show that @xmath9 is not left - orderable : if @xmath9 has left - ordering , we deduce a contradiction from the coarse presentation .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : pre ]",
    "we review standard notions of tangles , and a presentation of @xmath9 due to brunner @xcite , which is our starting point .",
    "we construct the coarse brunner s presentation in section 3 .",
    "the construction of coarse brunner s presentation consists of three steps : first we deduce an intermediate group presentation that simplifies the brunner s presentation , which we call the _ reduced brunner s presentation_. in the second step we define the tangle element @xmath16 for an algebraic tangle in a link diagram , and study its fundamental properties .",
    "the third step consists of establishing the  universal \" inequalities . by combining all information altogether ,",
    "we get the coarse brunner s presentation . by using the coarse brunner s presentation , in section 4",
    "we will give various family of links whose double branched covering has the non - left orderable fundamental group .",
