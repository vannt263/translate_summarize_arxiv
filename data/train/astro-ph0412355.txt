    "the recent discovery of the binary pulsar j0737 - 3039  a millisecond pulsar ( pulsar a with a period @xmath3 ms ) and a normal pulsar ( pulsar b with a period @xmath4 s ) in a tight @xmath5 hrs orbit ( burgay 2003 )  not only provides us with unprecedented tests of general relativity ( lyne 2004 ) but also reveals a variety of magnetospheric phenomena . among the latter",
    "are variations of pulsar b s radio emission correlated with binary orbital phase ( lyne 2004 ; ransom 2004 ) and modulated at the spin frequency of pulsar a ( mclaughlin 2004a ) , and periodic eclipses of pulsar a when it passes behind pulsar b ( lyne 2004 ; kaspi 2004 ; mclaughlin 2004b ) .",
    "it is the latter phenomenon that concerns us in this paper .",
    "detailed observations by the green bank telescope ( kaspi 2004 ) established the following frequency - averaged properties of pulsar a s eclipses : the eclipse duration is about @xmath6 s , which for a relative transverse velocity of @xmath7 km s@xmath8 translates into a size of @xmath9 km . eclipses are significantly asymmetric with ingress taking @xmath10 times longer than egress ; pulsar a s radio beam is extinguished more strongly post conjunction , consistent with zero flux , than before conjunction when some flux leaks through .",
    "analysis of the same data at higher time resolution by mclaughlin ( 2004b ) uncovered effects of b s rotational phase on the frequency dependence and shape of the eclipse during ingress ; its shape during egress is remarkably independent of either b s rotational phase or radio frequency .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of pulsar a exceeds that of pulsar b by about @xmath11 , so it is plausible that b s magnetosphere is compressed by a relativistic wind from a. calculations by lyutikov ( 2004 ) demonstrate that the ram pressure of a s wind can be balanced by b s magnetic field pressure at a stand - off distance @xmath12 cm which is within b s light cylinder radius of @xmath13 cm .",
    "a crucial point is that the size of the eclipsing region is considerably smaller than even the compressed size of the b s magnetosphere . to fully quantify the geometry of the eclipse",
    ", the inclination of the system must be accurately known .",
    "measurements of the shapiro delay established that the inclination is very high , @xmath14 ( lyne 2004 ) . a refined estimate by coles ( 2004 ) based on correlation of interstellar scintillations of both pulsars yields @xmath15 , which corresponds to a minimum distance of the a s radio beam with respect to b s position projected on the plane of the sky of only @xmath16 km .",
    "this refinement implies that the extinction during eclipse arises _ inside _ pulsar b s magnetosphere and that the radial extent of the eclipsing region is about @xmath17 km .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the absorption of the radio beam of pulsar a as it passes through the magnetosphere of pulsar b. we show in  [ sect : cyclo ] that resonant cyclotron absorption in the charged - separated , closed field line region would provide only a small optical depth .",
    "however , we demonstrate in  [ sect : synchro ] that absorption of radiation from pulsar a heats charged particles in b s magnetosphere to relativistic energies . in  [ sect : supply ] we describe how this enables the accumulation of additional , charge neutral plasma in b s magnetosphere . as a result ,",
    "the radio emission of pulsar a can be significantly extinguished by synchrotron absorption .",
    "we devote  [ sect : disc ] to a discussion of the ramifications of our model .",
    "the region of closed field lines in the conventional pulsar magnetosphere model contains a corotating , charge - separated plasma with number density @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the corotation velocity ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "we are primarily interested in the region of b s magnetosphere where @xmath20 and the magnetic field is approximately dipolar . for our simplified model",
    "it suffices to ignore the angular dependence of the field and set @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the neutron star radius and @xmath23 is its surface magnetic field .",
    "the particle _ number _ density @xmath24 can be higher than @xmath25 because the addition of neutral plasma does not affect the net charge density .",
    "we characterize this increase by the parameter @xmath26 defined such that @xmath27 in what follows , we assume that the magnetospheric particles are electrons and positrons .    resonant cyclotron absorption is the dominant source of extinction for radio waves passing through a conventional pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "cyclotron resonance occurs where @xmath28 with cross - section ( canuto , lodenquai & ruderman 1971 ; daugherty & ventura 1978 ) @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the thompson cross - section and @xmath31 the natural line width .",
    "strictly speaking , this cross section applies to photons in particular modes which differ for electrons and positrons , but we ignore this detail here .",
    "the peak cross section at resonance reaches @xmath32 , or roughly the square of the photon wavelength .",
    "nevertheless , the optical depth is modest because an incident photon only resonates with cold electrons in a narrow radius range . from equations ( [ eq :",
    "b_dep])-([eq : gamma ] ) we find that resonance occurs at radial distance from pulsar b of @xmath33 and that the optical depth is given by @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the radio frequency @xmath36 expressed in ghz and @xmath37 s@xmath8 is the cyclotron frequency at the surface of pulsar b ( i.e. for @xmath38 ) with @xmath39 . throughout the paper we set the neutron star radius to be @xmath40 km and use @xmath22 as a unit of distance . note that for the @xmath41",
    ", @xmath42 is approximately the ratio of the resonance radius @xmath43 to the radius of b s light cylinder , @xmath44 , a result obtained previously by blandford & scharlemann ( 1976 ) and mikhailovskii ( 1982 ) .",
    "the determination of the inclination of the binary s orbit to the plane of the sky based on the scintillation technique ( coles 2004 ) implies that the radio beam of pulsar a passes pulsar b at an impact parameter @xmath45 cm .",
    "since @xmath46 , at a first glance cyclotron absorption looks like a viable eclipse mechanism , although a @xmath47 would be required to match the eclipse depth .",
    "however , a closer look at cyclotron absorption , as described below , reveals a problem : a s radio radiation heats the particles in b s magnetosphere to relativistic energies making synchrotron absorption rather than cyclotron absorption the relevant process .",

    "in their example the pulsar s radio waves heat particles streaming along its open field lines .",

    ", we assume that it is a power law with most of the energy concentrated at low frequencies ( i.e. @xmath72 with @xmath73 ) as is typical for millisecond pulsars ( kuzmin & losovsky 2001 ) . the position of the low frequency cutoff of the spectrum is not very important for our problem ( although see  [ sect : reproc ] ) .    for the cross - section ( [ eq : sigma_synchro ] ) and an incident spectrum with @xmath73 , particle heating is dominated by the lowest frequencies .",
    "this also implies that a s radio beam suffers a low frequency cutoff which progresses toward higher frequency with increasing depth in b s magnetosphere .",

    "the optical depth @xmath103 can not be arbitrarily high because radio photons of frequency @xmath104 are not absorbed within the radius at which @xmath105 .",
    "this `` saturation '' of @xmath103 can be used to probe the dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath49 ( see equation [ [ eq : ss_max_abs ] ] for a particular example ) .",
    "we hypothesize that there is a continuous supply of energetic particles within the closed field line region of b s magnetosphere from a source located close to the star where the magnetic field is strong .",
    "radiation damps the gyrational motions of particles born in this region before they can slide out along magnetic field lines . under normal circumstances",
    "each particle would loop along the closed field line on which it was born and strike the star s surface in the opposite magnetic hemisphere . however , illumination by a s radio beam can re - excite the gyrational motions of particles that stream far away from b and then keep them suspended between conjugate mirror points ( see  [ subsect : retention ] ) .",
    "thus , both particle heating , making synchrotron absorption possible , and particle trapping , leading to a higher optical depth eclipse , are mediated by a s radio beam .",
    "after illumination by a s radio beam ceases , particles trapped by magnetic mirroring in b s magnetosphere cool and are lost .",
    "synchrotron emission reduces their energies to @xmath106 on a timescale , @xmath107 independent of their initial @xmath108 . from equation ( [ eq : q_synch_plus1 ] ) , we estimate @xmath109 as a consequence of relativistic beaming , components of momentum parallel and perpendicular to @xmath110 decay at the same rate . in the nonrelativistic regime ,",
    "velocity components perpendicular to @xmath111 decay exponentially on timescale @xmath107 while those parallel to @xmath110 remain nearly constant . as a result , the trapped particles sediment onto the neutron star s surface on timescale @xmath107 leaving only the minimum number density of particles , @xmath25 , needed to support the corotation electric field .",
    "thus the magnetosphere of pulsar b has to refill each time the radio beam of pulsar a illuminates it .",
    "the particle cooling time , @xmath107 , given by equation ( [ eq : t_cool_synch ] ) is comparable to the local travel time , @xmath112 , at the distance @xmath113 from pulsar b. without heating , a particle arriving at @xmath97 from a source located below @xmath114 would be in its lowest gyrational state . to become trapped",
    ", it has to gain enough perpendicular momentum during its outer magnetosphere passage to mirror above @xmath114 , and that for @xmath114 given by equation ( [ eq : r_cool ] ) hold in both relativistic ( @xmath115 ) and non - relativistic ( @xmath116 ) regimes . ] because of adiabatic invariant conservation .",
    "the minimum gain in @xmath117 required for trapping is @xmath118 where @xmath119 is evaluated at @xmath97 .",
    "so the minimum energy , @xmath120 , that a particle has to absorb at @xmath121 is @xmath122    cyclotron absorption of a s unattenuated radio beam in a single passage of @xmath97 results in an energy increase @xmath123 where the last line is evaluated for @xmath84 .",
    "use of the cyclotron absorption formula ( [ eq : e_dot_plus ] ) is appropriate because particles streaming past @xmath97 from a source interior to @xmath114 are at most mildly relativistic ( see  [ subsect : source ] ) .    comparing @xmath120 with @xmath124 we find that trapping via cyclotron absorption and subsequent mirroring is possible for particles with @xmath125 thus particles reaching @xmath98 cm with @xmath126 can be trapped .",
    "this threshold is not very restrictive ( see  [ subsect : source ] ) , so the rate at which @xmath85 can grow is primarily determined by the rate at which particles are injected by the source near b s surface .",
    "we can only speculate about possible sources of particles in the corotating magnetosphere of pulsar b. the requirement that b s magnetosphere fill with an appropriate density of plasma while it is illuminated by a s radio beam is not demanding .",
    "the total number of particles needed to provide the corotating charge density in b s magnetosphere is @xmath127 . boosting this number by a factor @xmath1 in @xmath128 s implies a trapping rate @xmath129 s@xmath8 .",
    "if every trapped particle were born with the energy @xmath130 ( subsequently lost as synchrotron radiation ) and only a fraction @xmath131 of them were trapped , the source power would be @xmath132 ergs s@xmath8 . for @xmath133 and @xmath134 ,",
    "this amounts to @xmath135 ergs s@xmath8 , much smaller than the spin - down luminosity , @xmath136 ergs s@xmath8 , estimated for pulsar b by lyne ( 2004 ) .",
    "our favored source is the creation of @xmath137 pairs on closed field lines by gamma rays with energies @xmath138 mev emitted by particles accelerated in the outer gap of pulsar b ( cheng , ho , & ruderman 1986a , b ; wang 1998 ) .",
    "photons from the outer gap can enter the corotating magnetosphere and propagate at significant angles to magnetic field lines .",
    "this facilitates @xmath2 pair creation close to the neutron star s surface .",
    "pairs born relativistic initially lose energy through synchrotron radiation on a timescale @xmath139 s @xmath140 ( see [ [ eq : gamma ] ] ) . as a consequence of relativistic beaming ,",
    "their pitch angles remain constant until they become transrelativistic .",
    "subsequent cooling by gyrosynchrotron radiation completely damps gyrational motions but preserves the component of velocity parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "thus particles streaming away from the neutron star have @xmath141 . as we discussed in ",
    "[ subsect : retention ] , this allows for their efficient trapping when they are illuminated by a s radio beam .",
    "under constant illumination by a s radio beam , b s magnetosphere would achieve a steady state .",
    "we have already described how particle energies would be set by a balance between the absorption and emission of radiation . here",
    "we concentrate on how the particle enhancement factor @xmath85 would be fixed in the context of the discussion in ",
    "[ sect : supply ]    the efficiency of particle trapping drops sharply as the optical depth at the local cyclotron frequency , @xmath142 , increases above unity .",
    "the energy that fresh particles acquire by cyclotron absorption in passing through the magnetosphere is reduced by a factor @xmath143 $ ] compared to @xmath144 ( see equation [ [ eq : delta_e ] ] ) .",
    "thus increasing @xmath142 lowers the maximum @xmath119 at which particle trapping can occur ( see  [ subsect : retention ] ) .",
    "the exponential dependence of trapping on optical depth suggests that @xmath145 does not greatly exceed unity and also that it depends at most logarithmically on @xmath49 .",
    "we set @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a parameter we treat as independent of @xmath49 and whose precise value depends upon the rate at which trapped particles are lost by unspecified relaxation processes .    for @xmath148",

    "@xmath84 we obtain @xmath154 absorption by the extra plasma of a s radio radiation reduces the efficiency of particle heating thus lowering the value of @xmath155 .",
    "the dispersion measure variation during the eclipse caused by extra plasma within the steady state magnetosphere is at least 2 orders of magnitude below the current upper bound of @xmath156 pc @xmath157 ( kaspi 2004 )",
    ".    the important distinction of the steady state model is that it _ predicts _ @xmath85 .",
    "this determines the lower and upper frequencies between which synchrotron absorption is effective at a given @xmath49 : @xmath158 it follows that the maximum optical depth at frequency @xmath159 , an observable quantity , is given by @xmath160 figure [ fig : spectrum ] depicts the evolution of the spectrum of a s radio beam with depth in b s magnetosphere .",
    "power at low frequencies is gradually eaten out by synchrotron absorption as the beam propagates deeper into b s magnetosphere .",
    "illumination of b s magnetosphere by a s radio beam probably starts only short time prior to eclipse .",
    "so we may be witnessing radio beam attenuation by _ dynamically evolving _ plasma in b s magnetosphere .",

    "heating has an exponential character for @xmath84 because as @xmath155 grows particles can absorb the incoming radio photons at lower frequencies because @xmath163 decreases making more energy from the unabsorbed spectrum available to heat them .",
    "this partly compensates for the decrease of the absorption cross section with increase of @xmath155 ( see eq . [ [ eq : sigma_synchro ] ] ) .",
    "once @xmath155 grows so large that @xmath164 becomes comparable to unity , heating is less efficient and @xmath165 .",
    "we estimate that particles reach @xmath166 at @xmath167 cm on a timescale of @xmath168 min .",
    "this is comparable to estimates of several tens of minutes for the duration of the illumination period judged from the orientation of pulsar a s spin and dipole axes suggested by demorest ( 2004 ) .",
    "not much can be said about the timescale needed for the particle density to reach its steady state value .",
    "presumably this is largely controlled by the rate at which the source near pulsar b is able to supply fresh trans - relativistic particles since these are readily trapped .",
    "energy absorbed by particles in b s magnetosphere from a s radio beam is reemitted as synchrotron radiation , albeit with some time delay .",
    "absorption takes place at @xmath169 , see equation ( [ eq : omega_1 ] ) , close to the minimum frequency possible , @xmath163 , and is reemitted at the considerably higher frequency @xmath170 . this reemitted radiation , although unimportant locally , may dominate the primary radiation from pulsar a deeper in pulsar b s magnetosphere .    here",
    "we attempt to calculate the properties of the reprocessed radiation for the steady state magnetosphere by applying results from  [ sect : ss ] .",
    "this requires choosing a low frequency cutoff , @xmath171 , for the assumed power law spectrum of a s radio emission . because there is little evidence for low - frequency cutoffs in the spectra of millisecond pulsars above @xmath172 mhz ( kuzmin & losovsky 2001 )",
    ", we normalize @xmath171 to this frequency . from equation ( [ eq : ss_r_e ] )",
    "we deduce that the energy carried by photons with @xmath173 is absorbed at a distance @xmath174 from pulsar b and reemitted at frequency @xmath175 ghz .",
    "the latter represents the upper cutoff frequency of the reprocessed radiation because @xmath176 increases with increasing @xmath49 ( see [ [ eq : ss_gamma_2 ] ] ) .",
    "a detailed calculation shows that radiation reemitted by all the relativistic particles within @xmath177 has a flat power law spectrum @xmath178 with index close to zero .",

    "luckily , this is far enough from @xmath184 ghz region of spectrum where eclipse observations are usually taken so that we do not need to worry about such complications .",
    "unfortunately , the reprocessed radiation can hardly be detected on earth because of very small covering fraction of b s magnetosphere as seen from a.",
    "a simple dynamical picture of pulsar a s eclipse by pulsar b s magnetosphere emerges from our considerations . prior to the onset of illumination by a s radio beam , the number density in the corotating part of b s magnetosphere is equal to @xmath25 .",
    "when a s radio beam strikes the magnetosphere of pulsar b , perhaps @xmath185 min prior to b s inferior conjunction , particles initially present in the magnetosphere rapidly ( in @xmath161 s ) become relativistic .",
    "their energies continue to rise until either synchrotron absorption is balanced by synchrotron emission or illumination by a s radio beam ceases . at the same time",
    "neutral plasma accumulates in the magnetosphere as the result of the trapping of particles that stream out in cold beams from a source near b. it is unclear whether the magnetosphere reaches steady state prior to the eclipse or whether is still evolving . in either case",
    "a density enhancement @xmath186 would be required to match the observed depth and duration of the eclipse .",
    "some time , perhaps several tens of minutes , after the eclipse illumination of b s magnetosphere by a s radio beam ceases and the particles cool on a typical timescale @xmath187 s given by equation ( [ eq : t_cool_synch ] ) .",
    "as a result particles no longer mirror and all plasma beyond that needed to maintain the corotation electric field is lost .",
    "this entire cycle repeats each orbital period .",
    "we speculate that part of the asymmetry between eclipse ingress and egress reflects a rise in plasma density in b s magnetosphere during the @xmath188 s the eclipse lasts .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath103 is very sensitive to increasing @xmath85 .",
    "not only is @xmath103 directly proportional to the total column density of absorbing particles , it is also proportional to the absorption cross section per particle which varies as @xmath189 and @xmath155 decreases with increasing @xmath85 .",
    "thus if @xmath85 were growing on a timescale of minutes during eclipse , egress would be deeper than ingress and the eclipse centroid would occur slightly after b reached inferior conjunction since @xmath97 grows as @xmath85 increases ( see eq . [ [ eq : r_e ] ] ) . in this picture",
    "the smooth ingress may partly be caused by the time - variable optical depth at a fixed location rather than the @xmath103 variation as the radio beam samples smaller values of @xmath49 .",
    "on the contrary , during egress the optical depth is higher and the abrupt termination of eclipse may signal the emergence of the radio beam from behind an almost opaque screen .",
    "this explanation requires proper timing .",
    "our model predicts a variation of the polarization of a s radio emission during the course of the eclipse .",
    "the polarization signal should be strongly correlated with b s rotational phase in a manner similar to the eclipse lightcurve variations found by mclaughlin ( 2004b ) .",
    "this prediction stems from the fact that synchrotron absorption of photons in different polarization states is sensitive to the angle between the photon @xmath190 vector and the direction of the magnetic field . modeling the polarization signature",
    "would be facilitated because b s magnetic field should be nearly dipolar at @xmath97 since @xmath191 .",
    "effects of general relativity are very important in j0737 - 3039 .",
    "lai & rafikov ( 2004 ) have demonstrated that gravitational light bending can significantly ( by @xmath192 ) change the minimum impact parameter at which a s radio beam passes b. thus gravitational lensing must play a significant role in shaping the eclipse profile . moreover , because of the binary s finite orbital eccentricity , @xmath193 , periastron precession driven mainly by the effects of general relativity forces a 21 yr periodic variation , from @xmath194 to @xmath194 neglecting lensing effects , of the pulsars minimum projected separation on the plane of the sky ( burgay 2003 ) . by changing the minimum impact parameter of a s radio beam with respect to b , this should produce observable eclipse profile variations .",
    "lyutikov ( 2004 ) and arons ( 2004 ) have suggested that the eclipse of a s radio beam is caused by synchrotron absorption in the magnetosheath that forms when a s relativistic wind impacts b s magnetosphere .",
    "detailed polarization observations offer a means to distinguish this viable alternative from our model .",
    "the model we have presented is necessarily rather simplistic  it is one - dimensional , it assumes that particle distribution functions are isotropic , and so on . where possible , future work should relax these constraints .",
    "a quantitative description of the particle source giving rise to the plasma density enhancement might also be pursued .",
    "further observations have the opportunity to reveal additional clues to properties in the eclipse region .",
