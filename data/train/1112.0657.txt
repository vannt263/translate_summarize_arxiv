    "nuclear shell structure is one of the milestones in nuclear physics .",
    "it is related to enhanced robustness of nuclei with respect to excitations , when a particular number of nucleons is present @xcite .",
    "a key element of the nuclear shell model is the spin - orbit force , which lifts the @xmath4-degeneracy and pushes down the orbits with higher-@xmath4 towards orbits of opposite parity .",
    "one of the major successes of the model is the ability to reproduce the nuclear magic numbers and to explain the islands of isomerism emerging on the segr chart when approaching the magic medium - mass and heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition to the spin - orbit force , it is the nuclear quadrupole deformation , which splits the high-@xmath4 states into a number of orbits with a different third projection of the total angular momentum @xcite , causing new sub - shell closures to emerge @xcite and high-@xmath5 isomeric states to appear in the deformed regions on the segr chart @xcite .",
    "the present article addresses the structure of @xmath6pd@xmath7 and @xmath8ru@xmath9 , which are the most neutron - rich nuclei in the palladium and ruthenium isotopic chains studied by means of @xmath10-ray spectroscopy .",
    "they are placed in a region of the segr chart where variety of shapes are expected , involving large degree of triaxiality and @xmath10-softness @xcite .",
    "also , because of the vicinity of the @xmath11 magic number , a deformed - to - spherical shape transition @xcite is expected to take place .",
    "due to the nature of the shell structure , isomeric states were observed in the two nuclei , which can be related to specific single - particle configurations , and hence can shed light on the nuclear shapes in the mass region .",
    "neutron - rich palladium and ruthenium isotopes were produced in a relativistic fission reaction .",
    "a @xmath0u beam was accelerated up to 750 mev /",
    "n by the gsi sis accelerator and impinged on 1g/@xmath12 @xmath13be target .",
    "the fission products were separated by the gsi fragment separator ( frs ) and implanted in a passive stopper .",
    "isomeric delayed transitions were detected by the rising detector array @xcite , comprising 105 hpge detectors .",
    "the data were processed by xia dgf modules providing signals with an energy resolution of 3 kev at 1.3 mev and a time resolution of 25 ns .",
    "the data acquisition was triggered by a particle detector , placed at the final focal plane of the frs .",
    "the data were stored in event - by - event mode .",
    "experimental details were previously published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "[ ene121 ] presents the @xmath10-ray energy spectrum in singles , obtained in coincidence with the @xmath1pd nuclei .",
    "a @xmath10-transition with an energy of 135 kev is observed .",
    "the inset of the figure presents the time distribution , gated on the 135-kev @xmath10-ray .",
    "the half - life , obtained with a single exponential curve , is 0.63(5 ) @xmath3s .",
    "[ 117ru ] shows the energy spectrum , gated on @xmath2ru ions , where a single transition with an energy of 184 kev was observed .",
    "the inset of the figure presents the time distribution of the 184-kev transition and a half - life of 2.0(3 ) @xmath3s was obtained from the slope of the curve .",
    "the two @xmath10-rays in @xmath1pd and @xmath2ru were previously observed @xcite , but no half - life information was published .",
    "fig .  [ oddpd ] presents the systematics of the low - lying excited states in the neutron - rich odd-@xmath14 palladium isotopes . the ground state in @xmath15pd to @xmath16pd is a @xmath17 state @xcite , while the @xmath18 value for the ground state in @xmath19pd and @xmath2pd are subject of discussion in the literature @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt the @xmath18 assignments for @xmath19pd and @xmath2pd as given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the extrapolation of the systematics towards the extremely neutron - rich odd-@xmath14 palladium nuclei suggests that @xmath20 to @xmath21 and @xmath22 to @xmath23 states will be present close to the @xmath1pd ground state , but not all candidates give rise to a sub - microsecond isomer .",
    "the low - lying isomeric states , observed in the odd-@xmath14 palladium isotopes are related to the decay of the negative - parity states as well as to the decay of the @xmath20 excited state via stretched @xmath24 low - energy transitions .",
    "hindrance factors ( hf ) , defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the partial half - life and @xmath27 is the single - particle estimate , were calculated for the isomeric @xmath28 , @xmath24 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 transitions and plotted on figure  [ fw_sys ] as a function of the neutron number .    the neutron - rich odd-@xmath14 palladium ( @xmath31 ) isotopes show structure close to that of the odd-@xmath14 ruthenium ( @xmath32 ) nuclei ( figure  [ oddru ] ) .",
    "the hf , calculated for the low - lying isomeric transitions in the neutron - rich odd-@xmath14 ruthenium nuclei are also plotted on fig .",
    "[ fw_sys ] . to increase the statistics on the systematics in figure  [ fw_sys ] ,",
    "hf were calculated for a number of low - lying isomeric transitions in the odd-@xmath14 cd nuclei @xcite . inside the encircled regions on figure  [ fw_sys ] hf for the 184-kev and",
    "135-kev isomeric transitions in @xmath2ru and @xmath1pd are presented .    on figure  [ fw_sys ] , the @xmath28 hf are in the @xmath33 range . if the 135-kev and the 184-kev isomeric transitions , observed in @xmath1pd and @xmath2ru nuclei , are of @xmath28 nature the respective hf will follow the systematics presented in figure  [ fw_sys ] .",
    "the @xmath24 hf shows a steady behaviour with the neutron number having @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath1pd and @xmath2ru data points would follow the systematics in figure  [ fw_sys ] if the two transitions are of @xmath24 nature .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath24 hf , the @xmath29 @xmath35 data points show an abrupt change varying six orders of magnitude . if the 135-kev and 184-kev transitions are of @xmath29 nature , then they will be six orders of magnitude more enhanced than the other @xmath29 transitions .",
    "hence , the@xmath29 nature for the two isomeric transitions in @xmath2ru and @xmath1pd can be ruled out .",
    "the @xmath30 transitions in the region have @xmath36 . if 135-kev and 184-kev transitions are of @xmath30 nature , than they would be enhanced and would not follow the systematics of the @xmath30 transitions",
    ". therefore , @xmath30 nature is unlikely .",
    "the single - particle levels , calculated with a woods - saxon potential for the nuclei in the @xmath37 mass region region @xcite , show that the @xmath1pd fermi surface involves @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] , and @xmath41 $ ] nilsson orbits , where @xmath42 was calculated from the energy of the first excited state in @xmath43pd . given the hf systematics ( fig .",
    "[ fw_sys ] ) , @xmath44 @xmath28 and @xmath45 @xmath24 transitions would cause isomeric states in the sub - microsecond time range .",
    "however , @xmath46 assignment for the isomeric state can be ruled out because of the direct @xmath47-feeding observed to the @xmath48 state in @xmath1ag @xcite suggesting the @xmath46 isomeric state in @xmath1pd has a half - life longer than the half - life of the observed in the present study nanosecond isomer .",
    "therefore , we tentatively interpret the 135-kev transition as a prolate @xmath40 \\rightarrow 7/2^+[404]$ ] @xmath24 transition .    the 73@xmath49 neutron of @xmath2ru , which has @xmath500.25 estimated from the first excited state in @xmath51ru , is placed on @xmath39 $ ] nilsson orbit @xcite .",
    "at this deformation , the @xmath52 $ ] down - sloping orbit is also present close to the ground state , therefore we tentatively interpret the isomeric transition as a @xmath53 @xmath28 transition .",
    "it should be noted , however , that at this deformation the @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] nilsson orbits are also present close to fermi level , which can give rise to a situation similar to the @xmath1pd scenario .",
    "the analysis of @xmath1pd and @xmath2ru is further complicated by the fact that the two nuclei are in a region where triaxiality , shape transitions and shape co - existence @xcite are expected to occur , which may result in unexpected deviations from the hindrance factors systematics presented here .",
    "therefore , in order to draw firm conclusions on the structure of these neutron - rich nuclei more experimental information and deeper theoretical analysis are needed .",
