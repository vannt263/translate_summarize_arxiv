    "the following red - shift dependence of dd @xmath12    uzan et al.@xcite , used the combined measurements of sunyaev - zeldovich effect and x - ray emission data of galaxy clusters and showed that if dd relation does not hold then the angular diameter distance measured from the clusters is @xmath13 , and hence the dd relation ( [ ddrelation ] ) gets modified to @xmath14    in this work our aim is to reanalyze the validity of dd relation in a comprehensive manner by using different data samples and parameterizations @xcite .",

    "any significant violation from the dd relation will hint at the breakdown of one or more of these assumptions . to model any departure from unity we parameterize @xmath15 with four parametric representations :    @xmath17 + @xmath18 + @xmath19 + @xmath20 +      for the luminosity distances , we use latest union2 sne ia data @xcite .",
