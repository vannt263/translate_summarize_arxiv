    "in this paper we studied the effect of higher - curvature corrections in low - energy effective string theory on the cosmological dynamics in the presence of dark energy fluid .",
    "since the existence of a phantom fluid leads to the growth of the hubble rate , the energy scale of the universe may reach the planck scale in future .",
    "this means that string curvature corrections can be very important to determine the dynamical evolution of the universe .",
    "we have considered string corrections up to quartic in curvatures for three type of string theories ( i ) type ii , ( ii ) heterotic , and ( iii ) bosonic strings . in our analysis",
    "the contribution of the gauss - bonnet term does not affect the cosmological dynamics in @xmath14 dimensions , since the dilaton and the modulus fields are fixed .",
    "for the fluid with an equation of state characterized by @xmath62 , we find that de - sitter solutions do not exist for type ii and heterotic string corrections .",
    "there is a de - sitter solution for the bosonic string even for @xmath62 , but this is found to be unstable .",
    "when the equation of state for fluid is that of a cosmological constant ( @xmath58 ) , we find that stable de - sitter solutions exist for heterotic and bosonic strings .",
    "we ran our numerical code to study the effect of string corrections around the big rip when a phantom fluid is present . in the type ii case we found that the solutions approach the big crunch singularity ( @xmath95 after crossing @xmath68 when the equation of state for dark energy is @xmath71 .",
    "meanwhile the hubble rate diverges toward @xmath96 with a finite time for heterotic and bosonic corrections , which implies that the big rip singularity is difficult to be avoided in these cases .",
    "the divergent behavior of the hubble rate for @xmath25 is associated with the fact that there are neither stable de - sitter nor stable minkowski attractors for the types of the corrections we considered .    in the present letter we restricted our attention to purely geometrical effects assuming that non - perturbative potentials may arise allowing to freeze dilaton and modulus fields .",
    "compactifications from higher dimensions to 4-dimensional space time result in residual modulus fields which are related to the radii of internal space . in general",
    "a modulus field is dynamical and interacts with higher - order curvature terms . the same is true for the dilaton field which is related to string coupling @xmath97",
    ". these may give rise to non - trivial effects , for instance , even the gb curvature invariant which is purely topological in 4 dimensions , does not vanish in the presence of dynamical modulus and dilaton fields .",
    "such a scenario would have important implications for future evolution of the dark energy universe .",
    "very recently , cosmological dynamics based upon effective string theory action was investigated with dynamically evolving modulus and dilaton fields in the presence of second - order curvature corrections @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite on the related theme ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the second - order curvature correction to einstein - hilbert action can significantly modify the structure of future singularities in dark energy universe .",
    "it is therefore important , though technically cumbersome , to extend the analysis of the present letter to the case of dynamical modulus / dilaton fields .",
    "a comment is also in order about the distinct features that different string models exhibit in cosmological dynamics . with fixed modulus / dilaton ,",
    "the evolution of phantom dark energy universe is clearly distinguished depending upon string models , namely , the fate of such a universe is big crunch for the type ii superstring whereas it is a big rip for bosonic and heterotic strings .",
    "this distinction mainly comes from the difference of the coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ corre ] ) and ( [ corre2 ] ) . in the type ii case @xmath98 becomes negative , which counteracts the energy density of the phantom fluid .",
    "this property is crucially important to avoid the big rip singularity as pointed out in ref .",
    "we note that this behavior also appears in the presence of a dynamical modulus field with second - order string corrections @xcite .",
    "it is really of interest to investigate how the final fate of the universe is changed when dynamical modulus / dilaton fields couples to third / fourth - order string curvature corrections .",
    "we hope to address this issue in future work .",
    "in addition , the higher - order curvature contributions used in our description have inbuilt ambiguities related to particular metric redefinitions .",
    "it would be important to investigate whether or not these ambiguities can lead to different fate of cosmological evolution .",

    "<S> while the presence of a cosmological constant gives stable de - sitter fixed points in the cases of heterotic and bosonic strings , no stable de - sitter solutions exist when a phantom fluid is present . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the universe can exhibit a big crunch singularity with a finite time for type ii string , whereas it reaches a big rip singularity for heterotic and bosonic strings . </S>",
    "<S> thus the fate of dark energy universe crucially depends upon the type of string theory under consideration . </S>"
