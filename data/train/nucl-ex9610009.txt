    "the properties of hadronic matter under various conditions of density and temperature are of high interest both in their own right and owing to their astrophysical connection : evolution of the early universe and of neutron stars . in earthly laboratories",
    "hadronic matter in a state far off its ground state can only be studied in heavy ion collisions at incident energies that are well above the coulomb barrier .",
    "such studies in the energy regime from about 100 a mev to 2 a gev were initiated in the mid 1970 s at the bevalac in berkeley .",
    "it became soon clear that the high multiplicity and diversity of particles emerging from such collisions required sophisticated detection systems covering large angular ranges while having high particle identification power and high granularity and/or multiple hit capabilities .",
    "due to the large variety of possible event topologies , there was also a need to register and sort a very large number of collisions in order to obtain statistically significant information .    with the advent of @xmath6 particle detectors like the streamer chamber @xcite , the plastic ball @xcite and , somewhat later",
    ", diogene @xcite , first dynamic signals of hot expanding nuclear matter were seen in the form of collective flow , i.e. correlated emission patterns involving many particles . together with studies of the chemical composition of the emitted fragments ( single nucleons , clusters , produced mesons ) and its possible connection to the entropy of the created hot and compressed matter , and further complemented by space - time evolution studies inferred from two - particle interferometry",
    ", great hopes arose that the properties of hadronic matter , namely its equation of state , and possible phase transitions , could be inferred from the data .",
    "the experimental and theoretical situation in the second half of the eighties was summarized in a series of excellent review papers @xcite . despite the tremendous progress achieved",
    ", it remained clear however that considerable efforts were still needed both experimentally and theoretically to achieve a sufficiently detailed understanding of the highly complex dynamics of these reactions in order to be able to extract the more fundamental issues .    at the beginning of the nineties",
    "a new generation of @xmath6 detectors emerged both at the bevalac and at sis / esr , darmstadt , that had increased particle identification power as well as higher granularity .",
    "one of the tasks of these new detector systems is to provide complete triple - differential coverage of the populated momentum space while achieving good particle identification and minimal apparatus distortions .",
    "the detector fopi , installed at sis / esr , is such a system .",
    "it was built in two phases : phase i , covering the forward hemisphere ( @xmath7 in the laboratory ) and based on time - of - flight plus energy - loss methods to identify and characterize the emerging particles , and phase ii , which extended the detector to @xmath6 geometry and added magnetic analysis .",
    "the first major experiment was concerned with au on au collisions in the energy range extending from 100 to 800 a mev .",
    "it was performed with the phase i detectors @xcite complemented by movable multiple telescopes @xcite that covered also backward angles .    in the present work we show and analyse data on very central collisions limiting ourselves to incident energies of 150 , 250 and 400 a mev . the corresponding center - of - mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "energies of 37 - 95 a mev extend from energies comparable to the nucleonic fermi energy in ground state nuclei to well above it . as we shall see , cluster formation in this regime is still the rule , rather than the exception . while hard nucleon - nucleon collisions play an increasing role , in addition to the mean field that seems to dominate reactions at lower energies , by far most of these collisions on a microscopic level",
    "are expected to be elastic : the internal nucleon degrees of freedom are still essentially dormant and in particular pion production , although well above measuring sensitivity , does not play an important part in the general balance of energy .    under these conditions",
    "the fact that phase i was still pion - blind does not represent a serious problem in a study aimed at obtaining a general overview of the triple - differential momentum - space population and the composition of the most abundant particles .",
    "the lower energy limitation was governed by the necessity to have sufficient coverage of the mid - rapidity part of phase - space in view of threshold limitations affecting heavier clusters .    indeed , one of the perhaps surprising outcomes of this investigation of _ central _ collisions was the still copious production of intermediate - mass fragments that we shall define to be fragments with nuclear charge @xmath8 and abbreviate as imf in accordance to established practice in the literature .",
    "processes involving the simultaneous emission of many imf s have been termed multifragmentation and have found widespread interest , see for instance @xcite .",
    "older exclusive information on heavy cluster formation from bevalac times was limited to an experiment at 200 a mev @xcite concentrating on sideflow : a remarkable result of this study was the demonstrated higher sensitivity of the imf s to flow , a fact that had been anticipated in the framework of hydrodynamical model calculations @xcite . since then , new information from central or semicentral collisions at energies beyond 100 a mev has emerged from work done both at berkeley and darmstadt @xcite .",
    "one of the important new observations , favoured by the sensitivity of imf s to flow , was the overwhelming and unambiguous evidence of a new kind of axially _ symmetric _ or radial flow @xcite as a signature of highly exclusive central collisions .",
    "this flow was far more important in magnitude than the sideflow predicted @xcite and discovered @xcite earlier and was characteristic of _ participant _ matter , in contrast to the sideflow phenomenon which was primarily interpreted as a spectator phenomenon .",
    "the development of an isotropic blast in energetic collisions had been explicitly proposed by bondorf _",
    "@xcite in the framework of an adiabatic expansion of a hot ideal - gas .",
    "this provided one possible mechanism of local cooling that seemed necessary to account for the formation of clusters .",
    "a year later , siemens and rasmussen @xcite first proposed that the data then available gave evidence for a blast wave. much later , evidence came from emulsion studies @xcite in which it was first shown that in events with a high degree of sphericity , fragments were emitted that were characterized by an approximately _ linear rise of the average kinetic energy with size_. this phenomenon clearly went beyond the expectations of a thermal model @xcite based on an equilibrated system _ enclosed in a box_.    our collaboration , taking advantage of combined high multiplicity and low directivity event selection , first showed that the heavy clusters indeed were emitted from essentially one source located at midrapidity @xcite .",
    "soon after , we came to the conclusion , with use of statistical models , that the occurrence of so many imf s had to be associated with a surprisingly low entropy @xcite .",
    "the new radial flow phenomenon was then quantized @xcite and a first attempt using the model of ref .",
    "@xcite was made @xcite to trace back the initial conditions of compression and temperature from the measured momentum distributions and an approximate account for the chemical composition of the fireball could be done .",
    "it also became clear that radial flow was going to have an essential influence on the quantitative interpretation of small relative - momentum correlations between imf s @xcite aimed at determining the size of the fireball at freeze out .",
    "further work concentrated on the isotope - separated light charged particles ( @xmath9 ) @xcite and it became evident that the simultaneous understanding of both the chemical composition ( light _ and _ heavy clusters ) of the fireball _ and _ the momentum space distributions of all the observed particles was going to be a special challenge .",
    "the present work concentrates on both of these aspects , presenting the data in more complete detail than before . after a brief reminder of the major features of the phase i apparatus @xcite in section  [ experimental ] we outline and discuss in section  [ centrality ] our method for obtaining a highly central sample of events .",
    "the aim is to isolate a maximal - size piece of hot nuclear matter with a minimum of contamination by spectator matter .",
    "the isolation of these highly central events will then allow us to take a , still qualitative , look at the general topology in momentum space concentrating , among others , on the gradual evolution with incident energy .",
    "then we explore in sections  [ velocity ] and [ chemical ] the possibility of accounting for the data ( momentum space distribution and chemical composition ) in the framework of a thermal model , which however , accounts for the presence of radial flow .",
    "a preliminary extraction of the radial flow values was reported in refs .",
    "this flow considerably diminishes the available chaotic part of the energy .",
    "the presence of imf s allows us to determine the flow profile with higher accuracy than before .",
    "an important point will be that the analysis keeps track of the energy and charge balance .",
    "after subtraction of the collective , or flow , energy , the remaining chaotic energy is interpreted as thermal energy that is then used in section  [ chemical ] as input into statistical models to see if chemical composition can be understood in terms of a quasihomogenous population of the locally available phase space .",
    "statistical model descriptions of the data that are _ not _ constrained by a fixed available thermal energy have been remarkably successful @xcite even at much higher energies @xcite .",
    "the results of these efforts will then bring us to consider the dynamical alternative ( section  [ qmd ] ) in the framework of the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model @xcite .",
    "in particular we will explore with this model to what degree the generation of transverse momentum results in quasi - isotropic topologies of central events , and we will consider the amount of scaling of radial flow and of sideflow and their possible connection . we will also take a look at the capability of such microscopic models to predict the probability of clusterization and the possible interconnection of the latter with the time scale of the explosion .",
    "a summary of the data and conclusions , together with a brief outlook ( section  [ summary ] ) will close this work .",
    "au on au collisions at incident energies ranging from 100 to 800 a mev were studied with the phase i of the fopi detector @xcite at the sis / esr accelerator facility , gsi darmstadt .",
    "only the data obtained at 150 , 250 and 400 a mev will be presented here .",
    "the beam intensities were typically @xmath10 ions / s .",
    "targets of @xmath11 ( for lower energies ) up to @xmath12 ( for higher energies ) interaction length ( i.e. 200 mg/@xmath13 ) were used .",
    "most events were registered under central trigger conditions , some under mimimum bias conditions .",
    "the central trigger consisted in a high multiplicity threshold on the external wall ( pm@xmath1416 , 17 , 21 , respectively , at 150 , 250 and 400 a mev ) which selected an impact parameter range up to @xmath15 fm in a sharp cutoff model .",
    "an average of @xmath16 events was collected at each energy under central trigger conditions . unless otherwise stated",
    "only these events will be analysed in the following .",
    "phase i of the detector covered the laboratory polar angles from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "it consists of a forward wall of scintillators with a granularity exceeding that of the earlier plastic ball experiments @xcite by roughly a factor three .",
    "the inner wall consisting of 252 trapezoidal scintilator paddles extends from @xmath17 to @xmath19 , and the external wall ( 512 scintillator bars ) covers the angles from @xmath20 to @xmath18 .",
    "each scintillator provides an energy loss and a time - of - flight signal allowing to determine the element number @xmath21 and the velocity vector of the charged particles . in order to achieve lower",
    "detection thresholds a shell of 188 thin energy loss detectors ( cluster detectors ) is mounted in front of the wall .",
    "it consists of an ensemble of gas - filled ionization chambers ( parabola ) in front of the external wall and thin plastic scintillator paddles ( rosace ) in front of the inner wall .",
    "a helium bag is placed between the target and the forward wall . with this setup charge identification up to z=15",
    "is obtained , with thresholds in the external part of the detector increasing from 14 a mev for z=1 fragments to 50 a mev for z=15 fragments .",
    "the energy thresholds are slightly higher in the inner part due to larger flight path and larger thickness of the rosace paddles in comparison to the parabola ionization chambers .    in some of the runs the fopi detector was complemented by 8 multiple si - csi(tl ) telescopes @xcite which could be moved in the horizontal plane over an angular range from @xmath22 up to @xmath23 .",
    "these detectors , operated in coincidence with the fopi detector , allowed isotope separation for z=1 to 2 and had lower thresholds of 8 a mev or less .",
    "the telescope data have been discussed in an earlier publication @xcite , but will be included here again in a combined analysis .",
    "the nominal beam energies indicated are understood to be mid - target energies taking into account all energy losses upstream .",
    "likewise , in the following , all momentum space distributions of the observed fragments are corrected for their path and charge dependent energy losses on the way to the detectors .",
    "the systematic errors of the measured velocities are estimated to be 1.5 % or @xmath24 % , whichever is larger ( @xmath25 is the velocity in units of the light velocity ) .",
    "using effective sharp radii @xcite for au one can estimate a geometrical cross section of 5850 mb corresponding to a maximal impact parameter b=13.6 fm . ideally , in a central collision",
    ", one would like to minimize the contribution of non - overlapping matter . in a clean - cut straight - trajectory model",
    "the spectator fraction can be estimated to reach the level of 10% at an impact parameter of 1.4 fm or a cross section of 60 mb which is just about 1% of the total cross section . because of the very high background of non - central collisions it is clear that global event - observables that are used for the selection of central collisions should not only have a unique _ average _ correlation with the impact parameter , but also a small _ fluctuation _ around this average value .    in finite systems such fluctuations are unavoidable .",
    "also , in the present energy regime fermi velocities remain comparable to the c.o.m .",
    "velocity in the incident channel making a clean separation of spectators and participants difficult as we shall see .",
    "traditionally , high particle multiplicities have been associated with central collisions .",
    "[ fig : pm ] shows charged - particle multiplicity ( pm ) distributions measured with the external wall . in the figure",
    "the distributions are cut off at a total cross section level of about 1500 mb ( 7 fm ) . with the depicted multiplicity range contamination from non - target background",
    "is estimated ( from target - free runs ) to be below the 10% level in the worst case and altogether negligible around and beyond the plateau edge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pm ] ) .",
    "future detailed comparisons with event - simulating models should of course take into account the granularity ( see section  [ experimental ] ) of the external wall and the resulting multiple - hit probabilities .",
    "the presence of a plateau ( on a logarithmic scale ) in these pm distributions allows to define a limiting value at the upper edge of the distribution that is characterized by a yield equal to half the plateau value @xcite . in our case",
    "the summed cross section beyond this limiting value turns out to be about 250 mb ( it varies somewhat with energy ) corresponding to geometric cuts of about 3 fm .",
    "this still relatively large cross section makes one suspect that the multiplicity fluctuation seen in the tailend of the distribution is rather large limiting the resolution of the associated impact parameter .",
    "the other drawback of the selection of events with large multiplicities is the bias this implies concerning the chemical composition of the hot object one wants to study : by requiring high average multiplicities @xmath26 one obviously fixes the average size of the emitted clusters which is just @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the total mass ) .",
    "another alternative to select the most central collisions is to look for events with a maximal transverse energy of the emitted fragments .",
    "if one assumes that transverse energy is created predominantly via nucleon - nucleon collisions , the picture is that the number of such collisions is maximal when there is optimal overlap between target and projectile . since in the present energy regime particle production is modest , the sum of total longitudinal , @xmath29 , and transversal , @xmath30 , kinetic energies is constant by energy conservation and hence in a perfect @xmath6 apparatus any function of @xmath30 and/or @xmath29 is essentially equivalent .",
    "simulations with the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model @xcite model showed that in our phase i geometry the ratio , dubbed erat , defined by @xmath31 is particularly suitable for event sorting @xcite . in this definition @xcite @xmath32 , @xmath33 are transverse and longitudinal momenta , @xmath34 is the rest mass , @xmath35 the total energy ( including the rest mass ) of a fragment .",
    "as we are not measuring masses in phase i , we replace @xmath36 by @xmath37 ( @xmath21 the nuclear charge,@xmath38 the nucleon mass ) when calculating erat .",
    "the sums are limited to the forward hemisphere in the c.o.m .",
    ", as the backward hemisphere was not well covered by the phase i setup .",
    "one other advantage of this choice of a dimensionless observable is that it is scale invariant in the sense that it will not vary with incident energy if the event shapes are scale invariant . in a naive physics interpretation and for",
    "central collisions one may expect three possible outcomes for erat : erat@xmath39 , may be associated with an approximately thermalized fireball .",
    "values significantly below two tend to indicate transparency , while values well above two signal squeeze out of nuclear matter at @xmath23 due perhaps to shock - like effects as predicted long ago in the framework of hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .    measured distributions of erat ( for values larger than 0.3 )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : erat ] . apparatus limits ( see section [ experimental ] ) roughly cut in half the true erat value ( see also section  [ qmd ] ) . for these distributions",
    "an additional cut on the external wall multiplicity pm ( @xmath40 , respectively for @xmath41 150,250,400 mev ) was done . with these thresholds on multiplicity background contributions",
    "are virtually eliminated provided erat@xmath42 .",
    "we found that the applied multiplicity cut had no consequence for erat@xmath43 .",
    "the approximate scaling properties for the erat distributions can be judged from the figure .",
    "the statistical errors are smaller than the symbol sizes .",
    "we are reluctant to attach physics meaning to the small variations with incident energy as the systematic errors ( 0.07 units along the erat axis beyond the 100 mb level ) are estimated to be only slightly smaller than the differences visible in the figure .",
    "we shall come back to erat distributions in section  [ qmd ] .",
    "since our prime aim was to select the most central events , it was desirable to obtain model independent information on how well centrality is achieved when applying various cuts on global observables such as pm or erat . in the limit of zero impact parameter",
    "the event shapes ought to be axially symmetric on the average .    using the method of danielewicz and odyniec @xcite we have determined azimuthal distributions of the imf .",
    "due to side - flow @xcite these distributions in general are peaked at an azimuth @xmath44 in the reaction plane if only fragments in the forward hemisphere are considered .",
    "the particular sensitivity of heavier fragments to flow phenomena has been anticipated theoretically , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite , and was first observed experimentally in ref .",
    "imf s are therefore a rather sensitive probe of deviations from centrality .",
    "figure  [ fig : azimuth1 ] shows azimuthal distributions ( limited to forward rapidities and @xmath45 mev ) under various cut thresholds on pm and erat .",
    "comparable integrated cross sections ( corresponding to effective impact parameters b=1 or 2.5 - 2.7 fm ) , were taken as indicated in the figure .",
    "the data were least - squares fitted using @xmath46 where the parameters are @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the azimuthal angle is @xmath50 . with a pm selection one finds quite sizeable azimuthal asymmetries with ratios @xmath51 in excess of five , almost independent on the pm threshold ( as long as it is sufficiently high ) .",
    "the @xmath52 ratios are considerably smaller when an erat selection is done and keep decreasing as the erat threshold is increased to the statistical limit ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these trends remain even when a midrapidity cut is applied in addition , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : azimuth2 ] : @xmath52 is saturated at a value of two for all pm@xmath53 while it reaches gradually the nominal value for isotropy when erat@xmath54 . in the range",
    "shown the integrated cross section varies from 350 mb ( 3.3 fm ) down to 20 mb ( 0.8 fm ) .",
    "thus , perfect isotropy is reached only for erat selections and at the cost of very severe cuts .",
    "as it is our aim to study the momentum space distribution as well as the chemical composition of the central fireball , a compromise has to be made between the need for good centrality and the minimum number of events required for adequate statistics . because of finite number fluctuations there is also the worry about statistical noise causing one to look at atypical events .",
    "we shall come back later to the severe autocorrelation effects that occur in extreme - cut situations . from the above study",
    "we concluded that while erat was a better choice than pm to achieve centrality , there was a need for another selection criterion that would allow to open up the severe erat cut necessary to achieve azimuthal isotropy .",
    "the idea followed was to define global observables that would be a measure of sideflow and to request _ small sideflows while maintaining high transverse energies_.    introducing the scaled four - velocity @xmath55 with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the velocity in units of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and the index @xmath61 refers to the incident projectile in the c.o.m .",
    ", we define the directivity @xcite @xmath62 and @xcite @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the transverse component of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 with @xmath69 owing to the phase i limitations all sums in eqs .",
    "[ eq : directivity ] to [ eq : qi ] are limited to fragments i emitted into the forward hemisphere in the c.o.m . and we use nuclear charges instead of the more commonly used masses . note that @xmath70 in the sums for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the observable @xmath73 is called _ mean transverse momentum per nucleon in the reaction plane _ , although it is dimensionless in the scaled units used here and , due to the condition @xmath70 , the vector @xmath72 varies with @xmath74 .",
    "the variables @xmath75 and @xmath71 do not refer to a reaction plane explicitly . in the absence of side - flow @xmath71 and @xmath73",
    "tend to be small and negative due to momentum conservation constraints .",
    "the same is true for the _ reduced directivity _",
    "@xmath76 where the random directivity @xmath77 is the value of @xmath75 averaged for the same subset of events but after randomization of the azimuthal emission angles .",
    "typical distributions of @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath73 for an erat - selected event sample corresponding to the most central 200 mb ( erat200 ) are shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dirpx ] .",
    "the evolution of the first moments of these distributions with the average value of erat or pm within narrow intervals is shown in the lower panels where the abscissa has been converted to the effective impact parameters .",
    "one sees that both measures of axial asymmetry ( as well as @xmath71 @xcite , which is not shown ) have completely analogue trends : for pm binning they never reach the value of zero , while for erat binning a clean maximum is resolved showing that below an effective impact parameter of 4 fm collisions are reached that have increasing axial symmetry as the erat value is _ raised _ and hence are interpreted as being more central .",
    "as all measures of sideflow were seen to be largely equivalent for our purpose , we opted to combine erat with the @xmath75 cut .",
    "note that @xmath75 , again , is a scale invariant quantity in particular when the multiplicity dependent average random value is subtracted .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath75 was determined empirically , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dircut ] , by taking the erat200 sample and gradually lowering the upper limit of accepted events while controlling the azimuthal ratio @xmath52 of the imf .",
    "these event samples will be dubbed erat200d in the following . in order to assess the dependence of the results on the selection scheme an alternate sample erat50 with approximately 50 mb , but without directivity selection ,",
    "was also considered in the analyses to be described in the sequel .",
    "occasionally we shall compare also with pm selected samples .",
    "a summary of the specifications of all these event selections is given in table  [ tab : eventsample ] . while the indicated cross sections are quite accurate on a relative basis , they share an estimated common systematic uncertainty of about 10% .    before presenting data under specific selection criteria it is useful to make a few remarks on the possibility of bias when choosing events in the tails of distributions of global observables .",
    "even such a heavy system as au on au is subjected to trivial finite - number fluctuations that sit on top of potentially interesting physics fluctuations .",
    "an idea of the magnitude of such fluctuations for the observable erat , obtained only from charged particles , but in @xmath6 geometry , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : eratfluct ] which shows the result of central event simulations with three different models .",
    "only two of the models will be discussed here , the third one will be picked up in section  [ qmd ] .",
    "the histogram in the figure is an isotropic blast model simulation ( that will be described in detail in section  [ blast ] ) , which by definition predicts an average erat value of two . in each event",
    "the model conserves energy , momentum , mass and charge . except for this constraint",
    "it is assumed that the multiplicities of the different species ( taken from experiment ) fluctuate in an uncorrelated way .",
    "similar assumptions have been used with success in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resulting , _ purely statistical _ , fluctuation of erat around the value of two is considerable . as this fluctuation is unavoidable in finite systems , it should not come as a surprise that a simulation with a quantum molecular dynamics @xcite code iqmd , @xcite , to be described in section  [ qmd ] , comes out to be indistinguishable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eratfluct ] ) . here",
    "we choose an energy ( 250 a mev ) and parameterization that happens to give also an average erat value of two . in principle",
    "qmd also allows for non - trivial fluctuations , but the finite - number fluctuations are dominating .    if one were to put an event selection cut in figure  [ fig : eratfluct ] at very low ( or very high ) erat values , that are significantly different from the average value , one would sample events that are _ not _ isotropic , but fluctuate between prolate and oblate shapes .",
    "high erat values for example indicate a surplus of transverse momenta and hence preferred emission perpendicular to the beam axis . by far the simplest way to distinguish if the high erat values represent a _ collective _ , i.e. correlated fluctuation , or a trivial , uncorrelated one , is to always exclude the socalled particle of interest ( poi ) from the trigger condition . loosely speaking : if out of 50 particles , 49 are going left , then",
    "if the move is _ collective _ , the last particle , our poi , will do so also with a large probability .",
    "if the move was an uncorrelated fluctuation , the poi will be uninfluenced by the random fluctuation of the other particles .    from an extensive series of test simulations we learned that failure to use this simple recipee",
    "will , in the tails of global distributions , lead to severe autocorrelation effects , that distort the true distributions .",
    "we found , as intuitively obvious , that such autocorrelation effects were rising with the deviation of the sampled events from the average event and with @xmath78 , i.e. the ratio of the charge of the poi to the sum of charges contributing to the global observable .",
    "therefore , in the sequel , we have always excluded the poi from the cut condition .    in many ways",
    "the procedure is the same as the well accepted procedure of eliminating the poi from the reaction plane determination , see our eq .",
    "[ eq : qi ] .",
    "the removal of _ one _ particle from a global observable ( which in practice is not measured with _",
    "all _ particles anyhow ) does not significantly change the binning property of this observable . if out of @xmath79 particles of interest in a given event @xmath80 have been selected , the event is accepted with a probability @xmath81 .",
    "this still allows to determine cross sections for certain cuts .",
    "the deviation from the yes / no logic of sharp cuts is not considered a serious problem .",
    "resuming now our investigation of highly central events , it is revealing to take a look at the variation of the event topology in the two - dimensional space of transverse 4-velocity and rapidity . in the following",

    "although near - isotropy in the _ polar _ angles is reached ( see also section  [ velocity ] , the erat200d _ azimuthal _ distributions are isotropic by selection ) , the contours reveal remarkable structural deviations that one could associate to bounced - off particles @xcite .",
    "it is clear that finite number fluctuations , corona effects , and the need for a finite sample to achieve statistical significance , are preventing the isolation of a pure fireball even if it exists .",

    "these differences are disturbing .",

    "_ , i.e. roughly again 10 mev _ per charge_.    there are several possible reasons for the irregularities in light - particle energies that make them subtle to use for flow energy determinations in the present energy range .",
    "the most obvious one is the occurrence of late evaporative decay , a more subtle one are reorganisation processes during clusterization @xcite.the former would involve alpha particles much more than the @xmath156he fragments , which would tend to look more primordial@xcite .",
    "indeed , the low alpha energies could be accounted for in a simulation including evaporative contributions @xcite .",
    "one could also speculate that tritons would in general have higher contributions from decays than the coulomb - inhibited @xmath156he s .",
    "however , the t/@xmath156he difference could not be explained in ref .",

    "a firm conclusion is not yet possible .    the reorganization processes , or self - organization alluded to in ref .",
    "@xcite , concern the processes of amalgamation of nucleons to clusters .",
    "energy and momentum conservation in such local processes demand that the condensation energy be taken up by the surroundings , that do not clusterize , i.e. by single nucleons .",
    "this could explain the high energies of single protons even at @xmath23 in the c.o.m ..    characteristic structural influences of the mean kinetic energies are also visible from fig .",
    "[ fig : avekin ] , for example the s - like shape particularly visible with the 400 a mev data .",

    "the resulting rather steeply sloped spectrum represents the most serious deviation of the model from the data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ekin250lp ] the model calculation used again the known isotopic ratios , but not the _ absolute _ values which were fixed from the @xmath6 extrapolated z - distribution resulting from the fit to the plastic wall data . in view of this , the reproduction of the data also on an absolute scale is satisfactory and shows the internal consistency of the analysis .",
    "there are some subtle deviations of the model from the data .",
    "the most striking ones concern protons and @xmath219he .",
    "relative to the blast model the data show a lack of low - momentum yields for the protons and a lack of high - momentum yields for the @xmath219he fragments . both of these observations tend to support our speculations made in the previous section .",
    "another aspect of the data , the transverse momentum distributions , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] for the 150 and 400 a mev data for two cuts on rapidity .",
    "the @xmath18 laboratory cut starts influencing the data at @xmath229 ( @xmath230 ) and @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "there is an excellent description of the midrapidity part , even for z=1 .",
    "none of the spectra shows a trace of a bubble ( or hollow cylinder ) depression .",
    "the high rapidity part is generally underestimated , revealing the deviations from the assumed isotropy ( more prolate event shapes ) at larger rapidities .",
    "this trend is larger for the z=1 and 2 fragments than for the heavier fragments and for the latter it is larger at 150 a mev than at 400 a mev showing once more the higher conversion to isotropy at the higher energy that was visible already in the topology plots in section [ centrality ] .      in the limit of very central collisions",
    "flow effects with directional preference can no longer be quantized with respect to a reaction plane @xcite since the high degree of axial symmetry achieved in such collisions , together with finite - number fluctuations , precludes an accurate reconstruction of this plane . in that case one",
    "polar _ angular distributions to exhibit possible signatures of anisotropic flow .",
    "in particular the squeeze - out effect @xcite , if dominated by compressional , possibly shock - like effects , as implied by the name @xcite , should then become maximal and lead to a pronounced peaking around @xmath23 in the c.o.m .. such predictions were made long ago @xcite in the framework of classical hydrodynamics and were also made recently by microscopic calculations @xcite .",
    "the other important cause of the preferential out - of - plane emission of high - momentum ( @xmath233 , in scaled units ) fragments ( if done in the proper flow frame that avoids spectator contaminations @xcite ) , namely shadowing effects caused by absorption or at least cooling down in relatively cold non - participant matter , should be minimal in the case of truly central events in symmetric systems .",
    "we expect that data obtained with the completed fopi detector will elucidate this important question in the near future . with our phase",
    "i limitation momentum spectra at @xmath23 are cut off at scaled momenta @xmath234 .",
    "nevertheless it is useful to take this exploratory look at polar angle distributions in highly central collisions for at least two reasons : a ) since we have used an isotropic blast model as reference for comparison with the data , it is important to assess how well isotropy is fulfilled at least to the degree to which this is possible at present ; b ) the high sensitivity of the heaviest observed fragments to flow in general , demonstrated earlier , might lower the limit of @xmath61 above which directional flow effects become measurable as compared to observing single nucleons @xcite .",
    "indeed , for less central events we have seen clear squeeze - out signals even in this limited geometry when looking at imf s @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall concentrate on the 400 amev data as compressional effects are likely to be stronger at this energy than at 150 or 250 amev and because threshold effects are less important .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the 150 amev data will be published separately @xcite .",
    "we recall ( see section [ choosing ] ) that here we have attempted to minimize autocorrelation ( which distorts the distributions severely , in particular for heavy fragments ) by excluding the particle of interest from the calculation of the selecting global quantity ( pm , erat , directivity ) .",
    "figure [ fig : polar1 ] shows for fragments of different size the degree of compatibility of the data ( cut erat200d ) with the isotropic scenario .",
    "deviations from isotropy ( taking into account the geometric cuts ) are on the @xmath89 level or less . in particular the yields of charge - one fragments show a surplus at angles forward of @xmath235 which increases with decreasing angle . due to",
    "the @xmath236 weighting this surplus is actually less than @xmath177 in terms of count rates and general balances in charge and energy .",
    "the overshoot at angles below @xmath204 ( necessarily balanced by a slight undershoot at higher angles ) is higher at 150 amev where it reaches @xmath237 and extends to all fragment sizes .",
    "the more prolate topology at this lower energy , when using the present selection methods , has been displayed already in section [ centrality ] .",
    "if one makes a cut @xmath238 on the scaled four - velocities , one can check , at 400 amev , the isotropy from @xmath239 to @xmath240 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polar2 ] for different global event selections .",
    "isotropy holds within @xmath89 or better for all these selections .",
    "a few finer points can be noted : for the 200 mb selection on pm a faint remnant of side peaking near @xmath209 is visible ; after application of the directivity cut , pm200d , the cross section drops to 20 mb and statistical limitations prevent one from observing deviations from isotropy below the @xmath89 level . the selections erat200",
    "( @xmath241 mb ) and erat200d ( @xmath242 mb ) are very similar , but tend to show a forward / backward asymmetry on the order of @xmath177 despite the removal of the autocorrelation .",
    "although we can not exclude completely double - hit distortions , there are at least two other true physics reasons why one would see asymmetries of this order of magnitude when using our selection methods .",
    "first , we define erat , eq .",
    "( [ eq : erat ] ) , using only particles emitted in the forward hemisphere , i.e .",
    "our selection criterion is not symmetric with respect to the c.o.m .. applying the same technique ( and filtering ) to our blast model simulation , we were able to reproduce such asymmeties and interprete them as forward - backward fluctuations due to finite number effects .",
    "a second effect , that was not incorporated in our simulation ( at the present stage ) is the fact that the autocorrelation might not be completely removed , if many imf s were to be accompanied by a splitting partner at the late evaporative stage ( so that the primary correlation is not completely removed as the splitting partner is not identified ) .",
    "when using again the @xmath243 cut , the data at 250 a mev and 150 a mev look very similar , even in detail , and are therefore not shown here .    to assess the importance of the isotropy in this inner part ( momentum space ) of the fireball",
    ", one should be aware that the @xmath244 cut is rather severe and represents only @xmath245 of the full spectra at @xmath204 ( c.o.m . ) .",
    "it should also be remembered that only the erat200d and pm200d selections are _ azimuthally _ symmetric ( by construction ) , while the erat200 and the pm200 selections , even with a mid - rapidity cut @xmath246 , are not ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : azimuth2 ] ) .",
    "our general conclusion concerning polar angular distributions is that they do not show convincing evidence for _ dramatic _ shock effects ( i.e. @xmath23 _ polar _ squeeze out ) as predicted semi - quantitatively in the early days @xcite .",
    "since out - of - plane yield enhancement _ has _ been seen @xcite under similarly restrictive cut conditions , especially for collisions with rather large impact parameters ( 7 fm ) , one is also tempted to conclude that the presence of non - participant matter is required for the mechanism of squeeze - out. full phase space coverage in future data should further qualify these statements .",
    "besides the velocity - space distributions the second topic of high interest in these central collisions is the distribution of the yields for the various fragment species . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zrobust ] we show as example the measured fragment charge distributions at 250 a mev incident energy .",
    "various centrality cuts were applied ( see table [ tab : eventsample ] ) : pm200 , erat200 , erat200d , erat50 .",
    "in addition to the clean - cut filter specified in table [ tab : limits ] and section [ blast ] the data were restricted to polar angles @xmath247 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the nuclear charge distribution is much more robust to the cut than the velocity - space topologies discussed earlier ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this fulfills a necessary , although not sufficient , condition for the application of a one temperature concept as used in the present analysis .",
    "such clean - cut distributions formed the basis for extrapolating the data to @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , a blast - model event - generator with the mass - dependent velocity - space parameterization determined earlier , was fed with the measured filtered z - distribution and the missing parts were numerically calculated as function of z and @xmath248 .",
    "the resulting @xmath6 integrated yields are given in table [ tab : multiplicity ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist ] . as",
    "an important consistency check the @xmath6 integrated total charge obtained in this way should be 158 for the au on au reaction . table [ tab : results ] shows the % deviations we found from the adopted ws2 scenario . except for the 150 a mev data , where a 13% deviation was obtained , the total charge is reproduced within 5% or better",
    "this shows that the isotropic blast scenario is not dramatically different from the data and in particular that the missing high - momentum parts near @xmath23 , that will be measured in future runs with the full detector , are unlikely to change this conclusion qualitatively . the higher deviation for the 150 a mev data was to be expected in view of the somewhat prolate topologies at this energy and for the selections chosen here .",
    "as a zero - order correction and neglecting pionic contributions , the yields in table [ tab : multiplicity ] were renormalized to 158 .",
    "the errors given in the table are statistical only .",
    "the uncertainty from the cut - dependence is 10% at the most till about z=6 and increases up to 30% at the end of the shown distributions .",
    "the uncertainty from the extrapolation is of the order of the normalization deviations just discussed and concern primarily the ratio of the hydrogen fragments to the rest , as the phase - space distributions of the former are not described so well , especially away from mid - rapidity .",
    "as we shall see all these uncertainties are well below the uncertainties of theoretical models .",
    "[ fig : zdist ] shows also the exponential curves @xmath249 , that were least - squares fitted to the data excluding the light particles and the @xmath192 point ( which is low because @xmath250be decays before it reaches the detectors ) .",
    "the resulting slopes @xmath251 were @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 for 150 , 250 and 400 a mev , respectively .",
    "the resulting average cluster masses are @xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 , respectively ( the errors imply a @xmath258 per degree of freedom equal to one ) .",
    "these fits serve to enhance the special role played by hydrogen and helium fragments and also reveal some odd - even structures : the fragment yields for @xmath259 ( f ) and 11 ( na ) are presumably somewhat low because @xmath260f and @xmath261na are less stable isotopes .",
    "all of this suggests the influence of evaporative decays . as a matter of fact , if one were to speculate that _ all _ the surplus of hydrogen and helium nuclei above the exponential extrapolation is due to evaporation , then less than half of the light charged particles are primordial in this energy regime .    with the aid of the light - particle data of ref .",
    "@xcite and the neutron emission estimate presented in section  [ blast ] , it is possible to complete the picture with various other multiplicities given in table [ tab : varmult ] . in using table  [ tab : varmult ]",
    "it should be kept in mind that the isotopic composition of the z=1 and 2 fragments at 400 a mev has been extrapolated from @xcite ( section  [ blast ] ) and that neutron yields were estimated using eq .",
    "(  [ eq : mn ] ) . the error in the latter",
    "was estimated by replacing the assumption @xmath168 by @xmath262 for @xmath194 .",
    "an idea of how clusterized the hot nuclear matter is at freeze out is given in table  [ tab : cluster ] which shows the percentage of protons and nucleons bound into clusters .",
    "these numbers are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] together with the deduced imf multiplicities , an observable that finds great attention in the multifragmentation literature .",
    "the degree of clusterization of protons is high ( about 80% ) and hardly varies with incident energy .",
    "what is changing with energy is the _ size _ of the clusters .",

    "this is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fluct ] together with distributions obtained with our blast - model simulation , duly filtered to allow a direct comparison .",
    "it is useful to note that the simulation uses a simple monte carlo procedure to generate events from the multiplicity distributions given in table [ tab : multiplicity ] and with the velocity - space parameters of our ws2 scenario .",
    "only events that strictly conserve mass , charge , energy and momentum are allowed .",
    "no other correlation of any kind is assumed .",

    "this latter plot ( panel c ) illustrates the sort of bias one introduces on imf multiplicities if one selects events by making cuts on the light - particle multiplicity , as is sometimes done in the literature .",
    "the major conclusion is that we find no evidence for fluctuations other than those expected from finite number fluctuations under the constraints of conservation laws .",
    "does the apparent purely statistical nature of the fluctuations , together with the exponential behaviour of the nuclear charge distributions beyond z=2 , suggest a thermal mechanism ? since we have determined the thermal part of the available energy ( see table [ tab : results ] ) we can use existing statistical multifragmentation models to check this idea .",
    "the only parameter left was the bulk freeze - out density which we fixed to the value @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is the equilibrium density of nuclear matter in its ground state .",

    "as these models are well documented we shall only recall here the general idea : following statistical principles all possible final states are sorted out and their relative probabilities are calculated .",
    "the probability of a certain final state of the decaying system is proportional to its statistical weight , i.e. to the number of microscopic states leading to this final state . in all three implementations an initial fast multifragmentation",
    "is followed by a slow evaporation from the primordial fragments .",
    "while qsm gives exact ensemble averaged results , wix and smm generate individual events and hence also contain fluctuations .",
    "coming back to our data , what we find is that all calculations underestimate the formation of heavy clusters .",
    "for qsm the degree of underestimation at the oxygen level is also shown in one of the panels . at",
    "400 a mev the oxygen rate exceeds the values calculated with qsm by four orders of magnitude . in order to give an idea on what is changed if one increases the collective energy ( and hence decreases the thermal energy ) by the maximum amount that seems tolerable from our analysis ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) , we show the corresponding results as dotted line in the same panel .",
    "we note also that switching to the lower freeze - out densities usually used in the literature ( and contributions from the tails of the density distribution implied by our diffuse flow density profile ) , increases the discrepancy between theory and data .",

    ", one may suspect that one is doing some double counting if one is including many high lying broad resonances , as these must , in virtue of levinson s theorem @xcite have a negative echo in the undisturbed continuum spectrum , an effect that is not usually taken into account .",
    "as these uncertainties affect the predictions and prevent a definite conclusion concerning the more fundamental issue , namely the adequacy of the statistical approach , it will be necessary in the future to set the treatment of , largely unknown , high lying levels on a better foundation .",
    "one consideration that could save the statistical model ( although its practical implementation would have to be rethought ) would be to postulate a higher density at which fragment sizes are frozen out. imf - imf correlation radii @xcite are not necessarily cluster - size freezeout radii , as such correlations are primarily sensitive to the last coulomb - interaction when sizes are fixed already .",
    "interpreting naively the probability of oxygen ( @xmath271o ) formation as @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the clusterization probability , one could account for the oxygen yields by raising @xmath276 by a factor of 1.7 - 1.8 .",
    "this could be done by switching to about twice the density assumed in our calculations , or about @xmath277 . at this density , of course ,",
    "the present implementations of statistical models @xcite are not valid .",
    "three considerations make this speculation interesting however , and perhaps worth pursuing :",
    "1 .   it seems reasonable that clusters heavier than hydrogen would form at a time where the average density is still comparable ( athough somewhat lower ) than the densities of the clusters that are about to form , which presumably are not too far from normal density .",
    "this would also provide a fast mechanism as at high density rearrangements are more frequent .",
    "it is interesting in this connection that new algorithms to detect clusters in simulations are now able to discern clusters at a very early stage @xcite .",
    "2 .   this could bring out - of - conflict the very low apparent chemical temperatures needed to explain the data with low freeze - out densities . at higher density clusters statistically survive at higher temperature ( see also fig . 5 in ref .",
    "the combined high - density and temperature would put cluster formation in these central collisions well outside the spinodal regime @xcite .",
    "the almost perfectly exponential yield - distribution and the absence of non - trivial multiplicity fluctuations also favour this viewpoint .",
    "3 .   the measured radial flow for heavy clusters would now be a signature of _ compression _ as it could not have developped in the low density phase .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the qmd model with pauli - potential @xcite predicts multifragmentation only if compression is present ( mechanically excited ) . in this connection",
    "we also refer to section [ clusterization ] where we found , using qmd , a mean - field dependence of clusterization .",
    "it is attractive to use transport models because they do not rely on a priori assumptions of global or even local equilibration . such models , which are able to simulate collisions event - by - event , are more ambitious , but in order to be usable they need to introduce many approximations that must stand the test of time .",
    "one such model is quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite and more specifically one of its variants the isospin ( i)qmd @xcite .    in the context of this work",
    "we were primarily interested in checking what such models have to say about the general topology of central events : can we at all expect a radially exploding fireball in such collisions with a maximum of nuclear material ( in earthly laboratories ) and a minimum of spectator material ?",
    "in particular is the observable erat , eq .",
    "( [ eq : erat ] ) , anywhere close to the reference value of two , expected from a global thermalization scenario ? are our methods of selecting central collisions by maximizing erat and minimizing side flow supported by such simulations ? because of the claim of qmd to handle non - trivial fluctuations , what does it have to say to the degree of clusterization ( in the structureless liquid - drop kind of sense ) and its possible connection to the phenomenon of radial flow extracted in the previous sections ?",
    "the general idea of qmd @xcite is to use the wide spread method of molecular dynamics with some quantum modifications specific to the nuclear context . for a derivation of the theory from a variational principle",
    "we refer to @xcite . as in molecular dynamics",
    "one solves the classical ( non - relativistic ) hamiltonian equations of motion for a system of a nucleons ( and in the case of iqmd more explicitly a system of z protons and n neutrons ) that evolve under the influence of nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "these involve in the case of iqmd @xcite skyrme - type ( density dependent ) interactions , a yukawa term with a range parameter @xmath278 fm , a symmetry potential between protons and neutrons corresponding to the bethe - weizsaecker mass formula , a coulomb interaction between charged particles and , finally , a momentum dependent term . an important decision taken within",
    "the model is to adjust the parameters of these phenomenological interactions to properties of cold , i.e. highly degenerate nuclei : binding energy per nucleon , asymmetry energy , saturation density and the real part of the nucleon - nucleus optical - model potential . one important difference to conventional molecular dynamics is the following : for the calculation of the potential gradient that is driving each individual nucleon , these are not treated as point particles , but are given a finite , but fixed spread around their classical phase - space location .",
    "this density spread is gaussian with a variance @xmath279 in coordinate space and an associated uncertainty - principle - conserving spread @xmath280 in momentum space .",
    "this finite spread introduces de facto a finite range into the skyrme-(@xmath281function)-like interactions and hence influences the finite - system dynamics and in particular also the establishment of correlations such as clusterization .",
    "there is some freedom in the choice of @xmath282 : in the iqmd model the canonical value is @xmath283 fm@xmath220 for au on au simulations .",
    "the freedom in the other parameters of the phenomenological interactions allows to tailor them in such a way that they imply a fixed compressibility @xmath285 when applied to homogeneous nuclear matter .",
    "it has been customary to allow for a so - called hard ( h ) version of the equation of state ( eos ) corresponding to @xmath286 mev ( 388 mev to be exact ) and a soft ( s ) version , corresponding to @xmath287 mev .",
    "the present status from low - energy nuclear physics is a value @xmath288 mev from a theoretical analysis @xcite of the breathing modes of nuclei , i.e. the giant monopole resonances ( gmr ) as excited typically by high - energy alpha scattering .",
    "( a very recent search for still missing strength in the gmr @xcite came to the conclusion that @xmath285 values as high as 300 mev could not be excluded from the gmr data ) .",
    "another important difference to molecular dynamics , but a point in common with buu - type approaches @xcite is the treatment of so - called hard collisions by a boltzmann - like binary - collision integral , borrowed from classical transport theory for dilute systems , and supplemented by a nordheim - uehling - uhlenbeck term to account for pauli - blocking at least on the local level . in this model it acts as an entropy - producing non - deterministic term as in practice collisions",
    "are dialed with monte - carlo methods whenever two nucleons approach within the radius corresponding to the total hard cross section .",
    "again , an important decision within the model is to use free scattering nucleon - nucleon cross sections , i.e. this part of the model ( in contrast to the soft collisions ) is adjusted to the properties of infinitely dilute nuclear matter .",
    "iqmd distinguishes neutrons , n , and protons , p , i.e. it uses the relevant cross sections @xmath289 , @xmath290 and @xmath291 .",
    "pions and @xmath292 s are included , but elastic scattering is dominant , still , in the present energy range .",
    "finally it seems worthwhile to mention also details of the initialization of each nucleus - nucleus collision , since they seem to have a surprisingly large influence on the final outcome @xcite : in iqmd the centroids of the gaussians in a nucleus are randomly distributed in a sharp phase - space sphere @xmath293 and @xmath294 , with the radius @xmath295 fm and the fermi - momentum @xmath296 mev / c . one of our prime encouragements to use iqmd was its reasonable stability against the variation of the initial distance between the two nuclear surfaces @xcite . for the present calculations , starting from a zero initialization distance , we followed the evolution for 200 fm / c ( i.e. a width of 1 mev in terms of final levels ) at which time clusters were formed with the minimum spanning tree method using a clusterization radius of 3 fm @xcite .",
    "decay past this time was not taken into account .",
    "for reasons of economy we took a randomly sampled unweighted impact parameter @xmath92 distribution from @xmath297 to @xmath298 , where @xmath298 was mostly 14 fm and sometimes 7 fm .",
    "experimental observables were then constructed weighting them eventwise with the factor @xmath92 . in general",
    "both the hard and soft variants of the eos were explored and some 300 - 1000 events per fm interval were generated .",
    "we shall start with the observable erat i.e. eq.([eq : erat ] ) since it played a key role in our event selection .",
    "iqmd in its standard implementation just described , predicts average values that are close to two in the energy range 150 - 400 a mev and for central collisions ( @xmath299 fm ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : eratiqmd ] for both the hard and soft equations of state with momentum dependence included ( hm and sm ) .",
    "no apparatus filtering was done here , except that neutrons were excluded .",
    "we have already mentioned the fluctuations to which erat is subjected ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eratfluct ] ) .",
    "the filtering effect in the phase i apparatus is considerable : the erat values are lowered and the relative fluctuations are increased . for unfiltered erat values in the range",
    "@xmath300 we found however that the filtered value was lowered to a relatively constant fraction of @xmath301 , so that differences between different parameterizations are preserved .",
    "therefore we can roughly say that a modification of the unfiltered average erat value by 0.2 units will give rise , after filtering , to a shift along the abscissa of about 0.1 units in the tail of the distribution ( at the 20 - 60 mb level in fig .",
    "[ fig : daniel ] ) . also , we observed in all model simulations that parameterizations that lead to higher values of erat for @xmath302 showed increased transversality at other impact parameters as well . as the value for the hard eos happens to be almost exactly two for central collisions at 250 a mev , we compare the erat distribution ( @xmath303 fm ) , after filtering with the corresponding fopi data in fig .",
    "[ fig : daniel ] and find that it follows the data rather well . as a curiosity we have also plotted in the same figure the ( filtered ) blast - model prediction using the chemical composition and momentum space distribution as fitted to the data ( but not to the erat distribution ) .",
    "of course the unfiltered average value for the blast - model is exactly two .",
    "we have already shown in section [ centrality ] that the blast model fluctuations which are purely statistical , but obey constraints of mass , charge , energy and momentum conservation , come out identical to those of iqmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eratfluct ] ) .",
    "since the blast - model is conceived only for central collisions , its normalisation is dependent on what is defined to be central. we see from the figure that a central component of the innermost 1 fm ( or 30 mb ) seems to hug the tail of the measured distribution .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : daniel ] shows the @xmath92-dependence of ( unfiltered ) erat values predicted by the hm and sm versions of iqmd . in the same figure",
    "we have also plotted the values predicted by a vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck ( vuu ) calculation using a different code @xcite .",
    "this model was used earlier in our collaboration @xcite for comparison with light - particle data since it includes formation of clusters up to mass three .",
    "this feature seems to lead , in the model , to very high erat values .",
    "since vuu by principle does not allow to study fluctuations , we have constructed by randomly mixing the test particles @xcite events which have the correct total mass and charge .",
    "these events then have the same relative , finite number , fluctuations as both the blast model and iqmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eratfluct ] ) . with these",
    "trivial ( but unavoidable ) fluctuations added on top of the model , we can then again compare with the data .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : daniel ] ( this calculation is limited to @xmath304fm ) , models with such copious transverse momentum generation are incompatible with the data .",
    "this particular model predicts substantially lower erat values however , if composite particle formation is not included @xcite .",
    "there are other , more subtle deviations between simulation and data . from fig .",
    "[ fig : eratiqmd ] we see that iqmd predicts for central collisions a rise of erat of approximately @xmath305 ( 0.4 - 0.5 units ) within the analysed energy range which , after filtering , should lead to a positive shift by about 0.2 units of the tail of the distribution when going from 150 to 400 a mev . in contrast , the data , fig .",
    "[ fig : erat ] , reveal , if at all , a trend to _ smaller _ erat values at the higher energy .",
    "( the measured erat distribution for 150 a mev lies almost exactly on top of the distribution for 400 a mev if it is shifted _ down _ by 0.1 units ) . despite the estimated uncertainty of the data ( maximally 0.1 units )",
    "one can therefore say that erat , in the experiment , does _ not _ increase with the incident energy .",
    "if the naive concept of global thermalization were to be fulfilled in nature , erat would be dynamically inert in the sense that its value for central collisions would not depend sensitively on details of the calculation , but always have the value of two .",
    "instead , however , all the simulations that we have done ourselves , or became aware of , show that erat seems to react to many parameter variations . besides the disturbing dependence on the more technical parameters @xcite such as the spread parameter @xmath282 described earlier , and even the details of the initialization ( sharp spheres versus woods - saxon profiles , choice of fermi - energy @xcite ) , there are the more fundamental dependences on the eos ( according to iqmd a @xmath306 effect , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eratiqmd ] ) and above all on the implemented nucleon - nucleon cross sections that enter the hard collision term .    from a recent paper by botvina et al .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the predicted final event shape in momentum space could vary from strongly oblate shapes ( high erat values ) , obtained if constant cross sections @xmath307 mb were assumed ( see also @xcite ) , to slightly prolate shapes if the in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross sections were lowered .",
    "erat values higher than two for highly central collisions ( @xmath308fm ) should lead to polar angular distributions peaked at @xmath23 in the c.o.m .",
    "this important cross connection and the possibility to draw conclusions on the magnitude of in - medium cross sections will be discussed more quantitatively in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "our general conclusion is that measured erat distributions are an important constraint to models .      in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sideflow ] we use iqmd to study the evolution of sideflow with the true impact parameter @xmath92 ( solid curve ) .",
    "sideflow is quantized in terms of @xmath73 , eq.([eq : pxdir ] ) , in scaled units .",
    "the soft ( momentum dependent ) eos was used and the apparatus filter applied . notice the enlarged abscissa scale : of the approximately 14 fm range of impact parameters only the innermost half is shown . when using erat binning instead of the true impact parameter we find that the curve follows the original @xmath92-dependence amazingly well down to the 1 fm level ( where the true @xmath73 becomes negative ) . when using multiplicity binning there is a lack of @xmath92-resolution below 3 fm resulting in an almost flat dependence , much the same as in the data , fig .",
    "[ fig : dirpx ] .",
    "this supports our method of picking central events : low side - flow plus high transverse momenta .",
    "the efficiency of this method should depend on the scaled strength of the sideflow at intermediate ( @xmath309 fm ) impact parameters where it is peaking .",
    "how does this strength evolve with incident energy ?",
    "in the figure  [ fig : erat ] we have seen that the erat distributions vary rather modestly with incident energy .",
    "one of our main results from the blast - model analysis , table  [ tab : results ] , was that the radial flow takes up a nearly constant amount of the available energy .",
    "a more detailed look back at the varying topologies , even in the most central collisions , see fig .",

    "@xcite . in analogy",
    "to reynold s famous laws governing viscous flow , one can expect @xcite in the hydrodynamics framework that scaling might exist under certain conditions .",
    "scaling would reduce many systems of different size and incident energy into one .",
    "deviations from scaling could then isolate interesting phenomena known to violate scaling : the most obvious ones are the influence of the eos , and connected with it , possible phase transitions .",
    "iqmd predicts that sideflow _ does not _ scale in this energy range , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sideflow ] .",
    "as shown in the upper two panels , this agrees almost quantitatively with experiment .",
    "the conclusion does not depend on the specific choice of the sideflow observable : using @xmath71 , eq.([eq : fdo ] ) , which does not involve the so called reaction plane explicitly , leads to very similar results .",
    "there is relatively less sideflow at the lower energy and hence the method of using absence of sideflow to increase centrality will be less efficient as the energy is lowered even further .",
    "we note in this context that the observables @xmath73 and @xmath71 are expected to be coalescence - invariant and hence better suited for scaling studies than the slope of @xmath310 taken at midrapidity which is steeper for clusters @xcite than for nucleons .",
    "is the eos responsible for this lack of scaling ?",
    "we found only very modest differences in the calculations using the hard instead of the soft version of the eos .",
    "( momentum dependence in this model seems to affect primarily the high impact parameter side of the peaks in fig .",

    "disappearence of sideflow @xcite in the energy range @xmath311 a mev has been primarily associated with the transition from predominantly attractive to repulsive forces , i.e. to the eos . in view of our iqmd results and our observations of the evolution of phase space with energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ptye ] ) another cause for non - scaling is suggested : the variation of the time - scale with incident energy versus the fixed time - scale typical of fermi - motion .",
    "sideflow , quantized with the observables @xmath73 or @xmath71 , is primarily a spectator phenomenon ( a more detailed study of relevant fopi data will be published separately @xcite ) : it develops into full bloom only when there is a clearcut spectator - participant separation .",

    "the spectators are seen to be recoiling under the explosive power of the fireball .",
    "although this push from the fireball scales in ultracentral collisions , there is , at energies still comparable with the fermi - energy , sufficient time for some cross - talk possibly via a different , one - body mechanism known from the theory of deep - inelastic heavy - ion collisions @xcite to mitigate the recoil . the spectators are cooling the fireball and the fireball is heating the spectators , i.e. there is some start towards a more global equilibration that weakens sideflows at freeze - out . in this picture , at some high energy , when the above globalization seizes to work because of a lack of time , sideflow at sufficiently small @xmath92 might become just a reflection of ( scale with ) the radial flow . at very high energy ( cern sps energies ? ) another time scale might come in : the spectators pass by with essentially light velocity , but see an increasingly contracted participant . if the explosion time scale is too long , again , there will be little scaled sideflow seen",

    "we recall that no decay after 200 fm / c is included : such sequential decays ( see section [ chemical ] ) would increase the discrepancy .",
    "the failure of the model is most dramatic at the highest energy and , there , is specifically associated to _",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mimfvsb ] where a combined erat ( low @xmath92 ) pm ( intermediate @xmath92 ) binning was used to take advantage of the better resolution of @xmath92 ( suggested by the simulation ) when a combined method is used .",

    "a harder eos , intuitively , could drive a faster expansion , leading to smaller pieces . under certain conditions , following @xcite ,",

    "the collective flow energies per nucleon listed in table  [ tab : results ] ( @xmath312 , row 6 ) are in amazing agreement with the theoretical simulations in @xcite where values of 21 , 35 and 55 a mev were predicted for the three energies . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that these values vary only slowly with impact parameter .",
    "however the splitting into longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom _ does _ vary with the impact parameter .",
    "our discussion in section  [ erat ] already suggested that the simulation in @xcite predicts too much transversality.    our method of extracting the radial flow , which does not need many events , was also applied to iqmd events .",
    "the main results of our analysis are reflected in a series of numbers for the fraction of the final total kinetic energy caught in collective flow that can be found in table [ tab : iqmdflow ] .",

    "this method is not available to experiment however .",
    "judging from the numbers ( row 1 and 2 ) in the table , there is a weak increase of the flow fraction with energy which is more pronounced at the low energy end , and there is a small bracket between the hard and the soft eos which gets larger as the energy is lowered .",
    "this higher sensitivity to the _ cold _ eos at lower energies was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was actually recommended at that time ( 1981 ) that the best incident energy for this purpose was around 100 a mev !",
    "intuitively , however , it is rather puzzling that the hard version of the cold eos should give _",
    "less _ radial flow in the iqmd simulation .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that a better than @xmath195 accuracy would be needed to solve the question of the stiffness of the eos .",
    "the argumentation stemmed from solving the one - dimensional rankine - hugoniot shock equations ( implying validity of hydrodynamics ) to obtain the maximum density and pressure in the shocked zone .",
    "such considerations usually indicate that the maximum pressure ( which is a sum of two terms from the cold and the thermal eos , respectively , the latter being smaller than the former only at sufficiently low incident energies ) rises relatively modestly with the stiffness of the cold eos due to a compensatory effect : the soft eos leads to larger densities .",
    "however there is no inversion as to which eos leads to higher pressure as implied in table [ tab : iqmdflow ] !    rows 3 - 8 in table [ tab : iqmdflow ] serve the purpose to test and defend the likelihood method as applied to the ( less complete and less perfect ) experimental data .",
    "most importantly , we have checked that all the numbers listed in the table , which were obtained without experimental filtering , could be recovered with a typical deviation of @xmath12 of the available total kinetic energy if we applied the threshold and angular cuts of the phase i fopi apparatus .",
    "it is seen by comparing rows 2 and 3 in the table that the likelihood method with our preferred profile ws2 gives virtually identical results to the slope method if applied to the same data with the same restrictions on impact parameter and polar angles . enlarging the angular range to include more forward ( backward ) angles tends to increase the average flow , a faint remnant of the initial purely longitudinal flow. in the iqmd simulation",
    "the effect is significant only at the lowest energy ( row 3 versus row 4 in the table ) .",
    "the likelihood method , in contrast to the slope method , also tests the shapes of the spectra ; rows 4 , 5 and 6 compare the results for the woods - saxon ( ws2 ) , the box and the shell scenario s . as in the experimental analysis ( fig.[fig : collectivity ] )",
    "the shell scenario underestimates the flow , while differences between the box and the ws2 profiles are less significant than in the experiment .",
    "we also checked what was the influence of mixing - in higher impact parameters ( rows 7 and 8 to be compared with rows 3 and 4 , respectively ) . for reasons of simplicity a flat impact parameter population between 0 and 3 fm was taken to approximate the experimental distribution @xcite . while one finds for the larger angular range a general rise of the apparent flow as compared to the values for the more central impact parameters ( rows 8 and 4 ) ,",
    "there is virtually no change if the angular range is restricted to angles closer to @xmath23 .",
    "this observation is our main argument for concluding that our extracted experimental flow values ( table [ tab : results ] ) , which hold for both angular ranges , should be representative of very central collisions and are significantly larger than the theoretical values .",
    "it is tempting to relate this smaller radial flow in the model to the failure to predict sufficient clusterization .",
    "again , future investigations , will have to clarify if the problem is technical or if it indicates a need for a refinement of the physics of the model . on the experimental side ,",

    "a possible interpretation of this effect might be of geometric origin if one assumes that there is a positive position - momentum correlation at freeze - out .",

    "c ) a more subtle effect might be that already in the high compression phase the innermost cells of the fireball had smaller entropies per nucleon which then were conserved in the subsequent adiabatic expansion @xcite .",
    "we have presented a rather complete account of the momentum space distributions in central collisions of au on au at three different incident energies , 150 , 250 and 400 a mev located around or well above the fermi energy .",
    "these data should represent a challenge to future theoretical analyses .    the strong sensitivity to flow of heavy clusters emitted copiously in these collisions allowed us to select very central collisions by combining high total transverse energies with the absence of sideflow which could be shown to be maximal for impact parameters of 3 - 5 fm .",
    "this method is supported by iqmd simulations which showed , in excellent agreement with the data , that the scaled sideflow was increasing with incident energy in the present regime .",
    "the total transverse energy in the data scales however better with energy than predicted by iqmd and its magnitude excludes models that predict strongly oblate event shapes for impact parameters below 2 fm .",
    "autocorrelation effects which are severe in these rare events ( @xmath4 of the reaction cross section ) , were avoided by always excluding the particle of interest from the selection condition . for these central collisions",
    "we could show that invariant cross section topologies for the imf s in the twodimensional space of scaled transverse velocity vs rapidity varied in a subtle way when raising the energy .",
    "all topologies are basically centered around midrapidity , but tend to be somewhat prolate , becoming more compact however along the rapidity axis at the higher energy .",
    "isotropy is reached only approximately . from somewhat less central events selected with high multiplicity window",

    "how well a thermal model that includes radial flow could reproduce the data .",
    "an isotropic blast scenario that allowed for a complex flow profile was adjusted to the data under the constraint of energy and charge conservation , yielding the subdivision of the available energy into a collective energy , found to take up @xmath318 , and a rest energy interpreted as thermal and used later as input into statistical model calculations .",
    "it could be shown that the heavier clusters were sensitive to the assumed flow profile and a woods - saxon profile with a large diffuseness was able to describe the measured rapidity distributions ( applying a low transverse - velocity cut ) and the transverse - velocity distributions ( applying a mid - rapidity cut ) .",
    "in contrast , the velocity distributions of single nucleons were found to be insensitive to the assumed profiles .",
    "the model , fitted to the full measured phase space , reproduces the size dependence of the average kinetic energies of the fragments around @xmath228 , however there is an offset indicating that the fragments are somewhat more energetic at these angles than at more backward angles , another indication of deviations from perfect isotropy .",
    "the spectral shapes of the imf kinetic energies are rather well rendered by the model .",
    "a close comparison with the light particle data suggest that their spectra and average energies are influenced by late decays and reorganization effects accompanying the local amalgamations .",
    "the polar angular distributions in these highly central collisions do not support a dramatic @xmath23 squeezeout .",
    "it seems that the presence of spectator matter is necessary for the squeezeout pattern .",
    "the blast - model fits were used to extrapolate the fragment yields to @xmath6 .",
    "although the average size of the clusters decreases with increasing incident energy we found that only about @xmath89 of the protons were emitted as single nucleons even at the highest energy ( 400 a mev ) .",
    "the thermal energy determined from the flow analysis was used as input to statistical calculations . using a freeze - out density of @xmath319 suggested by the imf - imf correlation studies",
    ", it was found that such calculations underestimate the oxygen yields by up to 4 orders of magnitude in two of the models used @xcite .",
    "large uncertainties in these calculations subsist however , because of the difficulty to assess the contributions from unknown very high lying levels avoiding double - counting .",
    "we have suggested that higher cluster yields could still be explained in the quasi - statistical framework if size - freeze - out densities around @xmath320 were postulated .",
    "such a possibility would also suggest that most of the observed radial flow actually already developped in the high density phase making this kind of flow a potentially very interesting observable .",
    "the relatively high apparent temperatures concurrent with this density would put cluster formation in these central collisions well outside the spinodal region . the almost perfect primordial exponential yield curves that are suggested after consideration of late decay processes and",
    "the lack of nontrivial fluctuations in multiplicities and other observables , like erat , also favour a fast cluster formation mechanism that is only possible at high densities .",
    "the multifragmentation could be favoured by the explosive high velocity expansion @xcite and the related mechanical instability @xcite .",
    "this is also in line with qmd calculations which suggested that cluster formation was sensitive to the eos .",
    "the present implementation ( iqmd ) of the qmd model however underestimates the degree of clusterization and does not seem to generate sufficient radial flow .    looking forward to new experiments , besides the obvious extension of this kind of data and analysis both to higher _ and _ lower energy , it is clear that one should aim at resolving some of the ambiguities left in the present understanding of the data .",
    "the role of losses on the way to equilibrium could be elucidated by studying the system - size dependence of yields and momentum distributions .",
    "the freedom about the correct fragment - size freezeout density should be further constrained by determining and comparing correlation radii also with other particles than imf s , for instance @xmath321 , @xmath156he-@xmath156he ( that seem to be more primordial ) and , perhaps starting from 400 a mev , @xmath322 correlations .",
    "close comparisons of the momentum space distributions of equal - mass particle pairs , @xmath156he / t , @xmath323 , would also give useful clues .",
    "in general correlation studies could give the information necessary to try to reconstruct primordial yields allowing to extract primordial clusterization probabilities , one of the clues to setting up the eos .",
    "the degree to which complete mixing of projectile matter and target matter takes place ( a necessary condition for the application of statistical considerations ) could be checked by studying collisions between nuclei with different neutron to proton ratio .    on the theoretical side a _ simultaneous _ account of momentum space distributions _ and _ yields of all the emitted particles and clusters",
    "remains a challenge , a convincing mechanism accounting for the large observed radial flow must be found .",
    "statistical fragmentation models appropriate for weakly sub - saturation densities ought to be developped and the role of high lying continuum levels explored . refined transport models , in addition to statistical models , will be needed as supporting tools to try to extract the time scales of the explosions , perhaps by studying the scaling properties of the participant / spectator interplay in the form of sideflow and squeezeout phenomena .",
    "the future microscopic theory will probably have to include the momentum dependent mean field on a relativistic basis @xcite , even at low energies , and have to treat the soft collisions ( mean field ) and the hard collisions ( nucleon - nucleon scatterings ) on a more consistent basis @xcite .",
