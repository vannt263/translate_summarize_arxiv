    "recently , the main features of the anomalous secular increases of both the astronomical unit and the eccentricity @xmath3 of the lunar orbit have been reviewed @xcite . while the first effect , obtained by several independent researchers @xcite , should be of the order of a few cm yr@xmath0 , the second one @xcite amounts to @xmath11 yr@xmath0 , according to the latest data analysis @xcite .    such phenomena attracted the attention of various scientists dealing with them in different contexts @xcite .",
    "thus , several more or less sound attempts to find , or to rule out , possible explanations @xcite for both the anomalies were proposed so far , both in terms of standard known gravitational physical phenomena and of long - range modified models of gravity .    here",
    "we propose an empirical formula which is able to accommodate both the anomalies , at least as far as their orders of magnitude are concerned .",
    "let us assume that , in addition to the usual newtonian inverse - square law for the gravitational acceleration imparted to a test particle by a central body orbited by it , there is also a small radial extra - acceleration of the form a_pert= k h_0 v_r.in it @xmath12 is a positive numerical parameter of the order of unity to be determined from the observations , @xmath13 km s@xmath0 mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath0 @xcite is the hubble parameter at the present epoch , defined in terms of the time - varying cosmological scaling factor @xmath15 as @xmath16 , and @xmath5 is the component of the velocity vector @xmath17 of the test particle s proper motion about the central body along the common radial direction .",
    "the radial velocity for a keplerian ellipse is @xcite v_r=,where @xmath18 is the keplerian mean motion , @xmath2 is the semi - major axis , and @xmath19 is the true anomaly reckoning the instantaneous position of the test particle along its orbit : @xmath5 vanishes for circular orbits .    the consequences of on the trajectory of the particle can be straightforwardly worked out with the standard gauss equations for the variation of the keplerian orbital elements @xcite which are valid for any kind of perturbing acceleration , whatever its physical origin may be . for the semi - major axis and the eccentricity they are @xmath20,\\\\",
    "\\\\ % \\dert e t   & = & \\rp{\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{na}\\left\\{a_r\\sin f + a_{t}\\left[\\cos f + \\rp{1}{e}\\left(1 - \\rp{r}{a}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}. \\end{array}\\lb{gauss } \\right.\\ ] ] in @xmath21 is the semi - latus rectum , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radial and transverse components of the disturbing acceleration , respectively : in our case , is entirely radial . in a typical first - order perturbative m s@xmath24 for the earth s motion around the sun , while its newtonian solar monopole term is as large as @xmath25 m s@xmath24 .",
    "the same holds for the earth - moon system as well .",
    "indeed , yields about @xmath26 m s@xmath24 for the lunar geocentric orbit , while the newtonian monopole acceleration due to the earth is of the order of @xmath25 m s@xmath24 . ]",
    "calculation like in the present case , the right - hand - sides of have to be computed onto the unperturbed keplerian ellipse , characterized by r=,and integrated over one orbital period by means of dt = ( ) ^2 df.it turns out that both the semi - major axis @xmath2 and the eccentricity @xmath3 of the test particle s orbit secularly increase according to @xmath27 the formulas in , which were obtained by taking an average over a full orbital revolution , are exact to all order in @xmath3 .    since @xmath28",
    ", it turns out that is able to reproduce the measured anomalous increase of the lunar orbit for @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , for such values of @xmath12 yields an increase of the lunar semi - major axis of just @xmath30 mm yr@xmath0 .",
    "it is , at present , undetectable , in agreement with the fact that , actually , no anomalous secular variations pertaining such an orbital element of the lunar orbit have been detected so far .",
    "if we assume the terrestrial semi - major axis @xcite . on the other hand , it is @xmath31 au ( http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/p@xmath32elem@xmath32t2.txt ) . ]",
    "@xmath33 cm as an _ approximate _ measure of the astronomical unit and consider that @xmath34 , and the previous values of @xmath12 yield a secular increase of just a few cm yr@xmath0 .",
    "also in this case , it can be concluded that , if applied to other situations for which accurate data exist , does not yield results in contrast with empirical determinations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , for the eccentricity of the earth , with @xmath29 , yields @xmath35 yr@xmath0 .",
    "actually , such an anomalous effect can not be detectable since , according to table 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the present - day formal , statistical accuracy in determining @xmath3 from the observations amounts just to @xmath36 ; it is well known that the realistic uncertainty can be up to one order of magnitude larger .",
    "similar considerations hold for the other planets .",
    "here we do not intend to speculate too much about possible viable physical mechanisms yielding the extra - acceleration of .",
    "it might be argued that , reasoning within a cosmological framework , the hubble law may give for @xmath37 if the proper motion of the particle about the central mass is taken into account in addition to its purely cosmological recession which , instead , yields the well - known local extra - acceleration of tidal type @xcite a_cosmol = -q_0 h^2_0 r , where @xmath38 is the deceleration parameter at the present epoch .    on the other hand , our empirical results , which are not in contrast with other observational determinations for the moon and the other planets of the solar system , may be simply interpreted , in a purely phenomenological way , in terms of a radial extra - acceleration proportional to the radial component @xmath5 of the proper velocity of the test particle about its primary through a coefficient having the dimensions of t@xmath0 and a magnitude close to that of @xmath39 : its physical origin should not necessarily be of cosmological origin .    finally , we want to spend some words about the nature of the anomalies considered .",
    "as it was shown , the anomalous increase of the astronomical unit has attracted the attention of several researchers so far .",
    "it was determined as a solve - for parameter by using different ephemerides which neither use the same dynamical force models nor the same observational records .",
    "further processing of more extended data sets , with more accurate dynamical modeling , will be useful in shedding further light on such an anomaly .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite conclude their review of the anomalous variation of the astronomical unit by writing at pag .",
    "194 : on the other hand , it must be remarked that a clear definition for the change of the astronomical unit is still lacking since some researchers believe that the astronomical unit is a redundant unit , like to the gravitational parameter @xmath40 of the sun , which should , instead , be empirically determined from data processing as a solve - for parameter @xcite .",
    "it is likely that at the iau meeting in 2012 a fixed numerical value for it will be adopted .",
    "anyway , this would have the effect of just shifting the detected anomaly to another physical quantity .",
    "concerning the moon s orbit , the first report of the lunar eccentricity anomaly dates back to 2001 @xcite ; such a phenomenon is still here @xcite , despite the increasing accuracy in llr observations and modeling occurred in the last decade due to the steady efforts of a wide community of researchers engaged in llr science and technology .",
    "on the other hand , it is not certainly unreasonable to expect that further modeling of classical effects occurring in the lunar interior may finally be able to explain the observed anomaly . anyway , until it will actually happen , looking for alternative explanations remains a task worth being pursued .",
