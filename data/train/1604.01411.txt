    "given the steep , monotonic decline in planet brightness with time ( e.g. @xcite ) , the currently known directly imaged exoplanets are companions to young stars ( @xmath6  myr ) , enabling investigations into their early evolution @xcite . while these young exoplanets share many of the same atmospheric properties as isolated brown dwarfs recently identified in young moving groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) , differences in the elemental abundances of their atmospheres may provide evidence as to their formation mechanism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "atmospheres of young , directly - imaged planets also represent an important comparison to the transmission ( e.g. , @xcite ) and emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) spectra of intensely irradiated planets transiting older stars .",
    "multi - wavelength infrared photometry of imaged planet atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) has defined a sequence that is under - luminous and redder than field brown dwarfs of the same spectral type .",
    "low resolution spectra of planetary mass companions ( e.g. , @xcite ) exhibit signatures of low surface gravity and spectral features indicating the effects of clouds and non - equilibrium chemistry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "altogether , these properties are difficult to reproduce with state - of - the - art atmospheric models , which have difficulty explaining the discrepancies seen with respect to field l- and t - dwarfs .",
    "the scorpius - centaurus association ( sco - cen ) is the nearest ob association @xcite , and has undergone multiple and complex phases of massive star formation , resulting in a large sample of young ( 520  myr ) and intermediate - mass ( 1.22.0  m@xmath7 ) stars @xcite .",
    "its well - constrained young age , proximity ( 90150  pc ) , and the presence of near - infrared excess around a large number of its stars @xcite  tracing leftover material from planet formation  make sco - cen ideal for giant planet searches with direct imaging .",

    "the luminosity of hd  95086  b is plotted relative to three evolutionary models in figure  [ fig : luminosity ] . at the two extremes",
    "are the `` hot - start '' @xcite models , in which gas accreting onto the forming planet is unable to efficiently cool resulting in a high initial luminosity and entropy , and the `` cold - start '' models of @xcite , in which the accreting gas has radiated away most of its heat , resulting in a low initial luminosity and entropy for the planet .",
    "intermediate to these are the models of @xcite , which predict a strong positive correlation between the luminosity and the mass of the solid core of the planet . in order to assess the range of probable masses for hd  95086  b , only the evolutionary models with the smallest core mass of 22  m@xmath311 were used from the @xcite grid .",
    "higher core masses result in a higher initial luminosity for a given final planet mass , converging with the luminosity predictions of the @xcite models for core masses @xmath312  m@xmath311 .",
    "the mass , radius , and effective temperature derived from fitting both the @xmath0- and @xmath27-band luminosity to the @xcite and @xcite evolutionary models are listed in table  [ tab : bolometric ] .",
    "no attempt was made to use the @xcite models as the two luminosity estimates were significantly higher than that for the most massive object within the grid , as shown in figure  [ fig : luminosity ] .",
    "based on the @xcite models , the mass of hd  95086  b was estimated to be between @xmath313 , using the @xmath0-band luminosity , and @xmath226  @xmath9 , using the @xmath27-band luminosity .",
    "the mass estimated from the @xcite models using the @xmath0-band luminosity ( @xmath314 ) was consistent with the two previous estimates , however as the @xmath27-band luminosity was significantly higher than that predicted for the most massive object within the grid , only a lower - limit on the mass of @xmath315  @xmath9 could be estimated .",
    "the quoted uncertainties on the model - dependent masses incorporate the uncertainty on the age of hd  95086  b , and the uncertainty on the estimated bolometric luminosity derived from the @xmath0- and @xmath27-band bolometric corrections .",
    "we have presented the first spectroscopic measurement of the young , low - mass , and extremely red exoplanet hd  95086  b. obtained with the gemini planet imager and spanning the blue half of the @xmath27-band ( @xmath1 , 1.92.2  ) , the spectrum was recovered at an snr of 35 within the individual wavelength channels , and shows a monotonic increase in flux towards longer wavelengths within the measurement uncertainties . combining the new @xmath1 spectrum and the revised @xmath0 photometry with literature naco @xmath3 photometry @xcite , the sed of the planet between 1.54.0",
    "was constructed and compared with other young substellar objects , and older field brown dwarfs . when placed on the mko @xmath233 vs. gpi @xmath1 @xmath231 mko @xmath3 color - magnitude diagram ( figure  [ fig : cmdb ] ) , hd  95086  b occupies a region of the diagram devoid of any comparable objects .",
    "while similar in @xmath3 luminosity to field late l - dwarfs , hd  95086  b is over a magnitude redder , and while having a similar @xmath4 color to field late t - dwarfs , it is over two magnitudes brighter .",
    "comparing to young substellar objects , hd  95086  b is most analogous to 2 m  1207  b , with a similar @xmath3 luminosity , but almost a magnitude redder in @xmath4 .",
    "2 m  1207  b was itself noted as being extremely red @xcite , which was explained by invoking thick clouds and non - equilibrium chemistry @xcite . the unusually red color of hd  95086  b may also be explained by the presence of circumplanetary material , however further observations sensitive to emission from accretion are require to test this hypothesis .    comparing the near - infrared portion of the sed of hd  95086  b to field brown dwarfs within the spex prism and irtf spectral libraries , a best fit was found at l7 , although the relatively sparse coverage of the sed for hd  95086  b led to a broad minimum spanning between l1 and t3 ( figure  [ fig : spex ] ) .",
    "the best fitting objects within the library were the brown dwarfs 2 m  2244 + 20 and 2 m  2148 + 40 which have been identified as possessing thick clouds , and in the case of 2 m  2244 + 20 , may have low surface gravity .",
    "the full sed of hd  95086  b was also compared with the predictions of grids of model atmospheres spanning a range of temperatures , surface gravities , and cloud properties ( figures  [ fig : best_fit ] and [ fig : fit_surface ] , and table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "morphologically , the sed was best fit by the models which incorporate a high photospheric dust content , and was poorly fit by those with clear atmospheres .",
    "considering the best fits within the dusty atmosphere grids , the effective temperature of hd  95086  b was constrained to between 8001300  k , with a surface gravity of @xmath316 . a higher surface gravity field",
    "brown dwarf at the same effective temperature would have already transitioned to a clear photosphere , within which dust particulates would have rained out to the lower atmosphere .",
    "this places hd  95086  b in the extension to the l - dwarf sequence occupied by young low surface gravity substellar companions which have retained their cloudy atmospheres despite low effective temperatures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hd  95086  b occupies a region of the color - magnitude diagram within which no comparable object exists , with an sed consistent with an atmosphere dominated by thick clouds .",
    "future observations of hd  95086  b to perform near - infrared spectroscopy at @xmath0 and @xmath28 ( covering the red half of the @xmath27-band atmospheric window ) , and to obtain thermal - infrared photometry at 3.3  , will help distinguish between the predictions of cloudy and cloud - free models . given its extremely red color , and the diagnostic power of thermal - infrared measurements , hd  95086  b also represents an ideal target for a future thermal - infrared integral field spectrograph in the southern hemisphere , similar to those already being commissioned in the north @xcite .",
