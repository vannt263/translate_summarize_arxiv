    "non - hermitian ( nh ) quantum mechanics ( qm ) has been used to describe an open system because complex eigenenergies imply the existence of a sink or source for the particle .",
    "pt_-symmetric hamiltonian is a special case in nhqm that can exhibit entirely real spectra@xcite .",
    "its development has gone through various stages@xcite with applications ranging from quantum cosmology@xcite , quantum field theory@xcite to quantum computation@xcite .",
    "a flourishing example is in connection with the optical lattice which can be simulated by the schrdinger equation .",
    "this provides a fertile ground to test the nh - related concepts experimentally . in",

    "pt_-symmetric periodic potentials and investigated several interesting features : ( 1 ) the existence of several branch points which demarcate the real and complex spectra@xcite . ( 2 ) optical soliton solutions are found within the energy gap with real eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) a quantum phase transition is identified when a sufficiently large real periodic potential is superimposed to render all the spectrum real@xcite .",
    "the latter two , which provide the basis for the fruitful beam dynamics@xcite , are closely related to the branch point and bifurcation feature .",
    "although the branch points and a complex spectrum have been attributed to the failure of perturbation expansion@xcite , we believe it is worthwhile to study in more detail the physical origin of this failure .    we shall start by studying a localized imaginary potential before embarking on the more interesting periodic case .",
    "several new features are discussed in section ii which include ( 1 ) existence of an upper bound for the imaginary part of eigenenergies .",
    "( 2 ) breakdown of the born approximation for scattering states unless a large enough real potential is added . ( 3 ) fano resonance within the imaginary barrier can cause the transmission amplitude to become huge by repetitive enhancements .",
    "( 4 ) an incoming wave packet will also exhibit special features when its momentum is near the resonance .",
    "we find that the size of the transmission amplitude is the key to features ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "in section iii we argue that the spectrum of the _ pt_-symmetric periodic potential is predominantly shaped by the transmission amplitude for a single unit cell .",
    "therefore , the conclusions in section ii for a localized potential are still applicable in the periodic case . by use of the bloch s theorem",
    ", we derive an analytic criteria for the occurrence of branch point and the band structure bifurcation .",
    "discussions and conclusions are arranged in the final section iv .",
    "at first glance , one might think that the eigenenergies of a complex potential are most likely also complex .",
    "this is in fact not true .",
    "for instance , take an imaginary square potential @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 where @xmath3 and zero potential elsewhere .",
    "it exhibits both real / imaginary eigenvalues , which are continuous / discrete and correspond to scattering / localized states , respectively . since the barrier potential is symmetric with respect to @xmath4 , the spatial part of the localized wavefunction , @xmath5 where @xmath6 has been set to unity for convenience , can be expressed as : @xmath7 where momentum @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real and positive , @xmath10 is complex , and the @xmath11 sign denotes respectively the even / odd - parity state with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the minus sign in the exponent of @xmath12 is to prevent it from blowing up at @xmath13 .",
    "these momenta are related by the complex energy @xmath14 : @xmath15    one should be aware that the standard concept of density current need not survive@xcite the transition to nhqm .",
    "for instance , in the case of a _",
    "pt_-symmetric potential @xmath16 has to be redefined as @xmath17/2 m$ ] in order to obtain the continuity equation .",
    "for the sake of arguments , let us stick to the standard notion and deduce the following mathematical equation from the schrdinger equation for a general complex potential @xmath18 : @xmath19 where the symbol i m denotes taking the imaginary part and @xmath20/2 m$ ] .",
    "integrating over the whole space gives @xmath21 where @xmath22 vanishes at @xmath23 for the localized state in eq.([eq : fstate ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following inequality @xmath24 which tells us that the height of the imaginary barrier @xmath25 serves as an upper bound for @xmath26 : @xmath27    by matching the boundary conditions , we can further show that the number of these localized states is finite and their energies are discrete .",
    "in contrast to being zero for a real well , the current density @xmath16 is not only nonvanishing , but also quantized for an imaginary barrier / well : @xmath28 where @xmath29 labels these discrete localized states .",
    "all the derivations so far are based on the assumption that @xmath3 . however , it is easy to generalize to an imaginary well .",
    "the action of changing the potential from @xmath30 to @xmath31 is equivalent to reversing the time , which transforms the hydrant - like bound state into a sink .",
    "the same conclusion applies to the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies after we take the complex conjugate of the time - independent schrdinger equation . as a result , the upper bound in eq.([eq : limit - e ] )",
    "needs to be modified as @xmath32      another interesting problem is to study the transmission and reflection coefficients for a complex square barrier .",
    "this is relevant to our discussion of the spectrum for a periodic potential in section iii .",
    "the scattering state takes the form : @xmath33 where subscript @xmath34 is to distinguish this right - moving state from its degenerate state @xmath35 that travels in the opposite direction .",
    "fitting the boundary conditions , we find @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the complex momentum inside the barrier .",
    "the amplitude @xmath38 in eq.([phi ] ) consists of contributions from all paths that reflect inside the barrier arbitrary number of times : @xmath39 where @xmath40/@xmath41 denote the transmission / reflection amplitudes at the boundaries @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the higher - order terms in eq.([t ] ) converge to zero for a real barrier . but this is no longer true for a positive imaginary barrier because the longer they stay in the source the more probability they can gain . as a result , the values of resonance peaks can be much bigger than unity , and the born approximation that neglects the higher - order terms is expected to break down .",
    "these two features are clearly shown in fig.[f : tr0 ] and the number of resonances and their peak values increase when we raise @xmath42 in fig.[f : tr1 ] .    .",
    "the transmission and reflection coefficients of an imaginary barrier with height @xmath43 and width @xmath44 are plotted as a function of @xmath45 where @xmath14 represents the energy of the scattering state .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]     except the barrier height is increased by eight folds to @xmath46.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another important issue of the scattering process is the interference condition for fano resonance . in real barriers , the resonance in transmission results from the constructive interference between different scattering paths shown in eq.([t ] ) , which gives the familiar condition @xmath47 . in the mean time",
    ", reflection peaks are attributed to the destructive interference when @xmath48 is satisfied .",
    "these two conditions become more complicated for an imaginary potential because the phase shift due to reflections from the boundaries between the imaginary and real potential regimes is energy - dependent . the amplitude @xmath41 in eq.([t ] ) can be determined by studying the reflection by an imaginary step potential of height @xmath30 : @xmath49 which shows that there is an additional phase shift ranging from 0 to @xmath50 as @xmath14 increases .",
    "it is straightforward to write down an equation similar to eq.([t ] ) for the reflection amplitude , @xmath34 .",
    "since both equations are geometric series with the same common ratio , @xmath51 , it is expected that the transmission and reflective resonances for an imaginary barrier should all follow the same second criterion , eq.([n ] ) , at the limit @xmath52 . to verify these interference features , a partial list of the energies , peak values of the transmission coefficient and corresponding @xmath29 in fig.[f : tr1 ]",
    "are numerically calculated and summarized in tab .",
    "[ tb : table ] . for an imaginary well , eq.([phase ] ) remains valid after @xmath42 is replaced by @xmath53 .",
    "however , the resonance peaks are no longer pronounced because the sink now draws in probability as the wave reflects in the well .",

    "since the non - hermitian potential results from our examining an open system which is allowed to exchange particles with its environment , the conventional continuity equation is no longer obeyed@xcite .",
    "one interesting debate@xcite is whether it is meaningful to mend this loss of unitarity .",
    "several studies@xcite have been devoted to this effort .",
    "they tried to construct a metric and corresponding transformed wave function as the general framework@xcite to examine the subsystem in a quasi - hermitian analysis .",
    "although the unitarity can be restored , one is constrained to discuss wavefunctions either coming simultaneously from both sides@xcite or exhibiting different normalization constants on either side of the potential@xcite . to resolve these dilemmas",
    ", jones@xcite suggested that one simply treats the non - hermitian scattering potential as an effective one in the standard framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "this is the view we adopt in this work at studying the localized nh potentials as a phenomenological model of a quantum sink or source in an open system .    in conclusion , although the breakdown of perturbation approach has been identified to be intimately linked to the existence of complex spectrum for a _",
    "pt_-symmetric periodic potential , we offer new insights into their relationship by studying the less sophisticated case of an imaginary barrier potential . due to the simplicity of this potential form , we are able to elucidate the cause of the similar breakdown of perturbation , why the perturbation can be remedied by the superimposition of a sufficiently large real potential , and the condition for a constructive interference which differs from that for a real potential .",
