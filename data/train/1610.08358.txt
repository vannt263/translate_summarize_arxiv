    "the strong interactions have approximate chiral symmetry and electroweak interactions conserve the chirality , so the transversity distributions can not be extracted in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "it needs to couple to another chiral - odd quantity in the cross - section .",
    "it can be obtained drell - yan processes and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , because distributions of transversity do come out at leading twist in the cross - section . in ref.@xcite , it was extracted using the experimental data on azimuthal asymmetries in sidis , from belle @xcite as well as data for the nucleon from the hermes @xcite and compass @xcite collaborations .",
