    "the phenomenon of brownian motion has assumed a fundamental and influential role in the development of thermodynamical and statistical theories and continues to do so as an inspiring source for active research in various fields of natural sciences @xcite .",
    "the brownian motion dynamics can conveniently be described by a generalized langevin equation ( gle ) .",
    "the gle was originally derived by mori @xcite , kawasaki @xcite , and zwanzig @xcite by use of the gram - schmidt procedure .",
    "it was further investigated by lee using the recurrence relations method @xcite . starting out from the well - known system - plus - oscillator - reservoir model as e.g. detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one obtains the gle derived from first principles .",
    "the validity of a thermal gle is typically restricted to the case with a thermal equilibrium ; e.g. see in refs .",
    "specifically , such a gle dynamics reads @xcite : @xmath0 notably , the thermal noise @xmath1 is not correlated with the initial velocity , i.e. , @xmath2 , see in refs .",
    "@xcite and in section iii below .",
    "in contrast , the initial position @xmath3 typically is correlated with @xmath4 .",
    "the memory friction @xmath5 is in thermal equilibrium related to the correlation of stationary random forces @xcite .",
    "kubo @xcite has addressed the common behavior of a classical equilibrium bath by setting @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath8 denotes the bath temperature .",
    "the one - sided fourier transform of @xmath9 obeys re@xmath10 for real - valued @xmath11 .",
    "this correlation result for the thermal noise @xmath12 is commonly termed the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) of the second kind @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear gle can also be extended to account for a nonlinear system - linear bath interaction @xcite , yielding a structure as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , but now with a nonlinear , coordinate - dependent friction function .",
    "it even can be generalized to arbitrary nonlinear system - nonlinear bath interactions containing then the potential of mean force @xcite .    with this work we aim at extending the theory of classical brownian motion by focussing on the intricacies of a possible non - markovian with an incomplete , non - stokesian dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that the commonly stated conditions for the equilibrium bath are generally not complete within the framework of linear response theory .",
    "this is so , because the existence of anomalous diffusion has not been considered in the original treatment by kubo and others . moreover , we discuss also the influence of initial correlation preparation between the system and the heat bath upon the asymptotical behavior of the force - free system .",
    "let us first consider a free brownian dynamics with @xmath13 , possessing via the fdt of the second kind a finite - valued zero - frequency friction .",
    "if this dynamics is next subjected to a constant external force , i.e. @xmath14 , the acceleration vanishes in the case of a stokesian friction , because the external force balances the friction force .",
    "a problem of broad interest is whether there exists an",
    "_ intermediate situation _ between the newtonian mechanics and such an ordinary langevin formalism .",
    "this in turn necessitates a non - stokesian dissipation mechanism such that the asymptotic long - time statistical probability will typically approach a stationary state that explicitly depends on the initial preparation .",
    "it is thus of great practical interest to research what kind of heat bath can take on this role .",
    "such non - ergodic non - equilibrium thermodynamics presents a timely subject that is presently hotly debated , both within theory @xcite and experiment @xcite .    for a gle subjected to a constant force ; i.e. @xmath15 , the solution of ( 1 ) can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "the average velocity and the average displacement under the external bias @xmath36 emerge at long times as @xmath37 where @xmath38/s^2_i$ ] is a noise - dependent quantity .",
    "herein , we indicate by @xmath39 the average with respect to the initial preparation of the state variables , i.e. an average over their initial values and @xmath40 is the noise average . the dissipative _ acceleration _ of a brownian particle of mass @xmath41 subjected to a constant force @xmath36 then reads : @xmath42 where generally @xmath43 .",
    "this quantity @xmath32 will be termed the _ dissipation reducing _ factor , the dissipation is reduced as @xmath32 is increased .",
    "this result is intermediate between a purely newtonian mechanics ( obeying @xmath44 ) and an ordinary langevin dynamics ( with @xmath45 ) including of gles .",
    "the two limiting results for the asymptotic dynamics are found to read : ( i ) the newton case with @xmath44 implying no dissipation , i.e. @xmath46 with @xmath47 , yielding : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "( ii ) the commonly known , ordinary langevin situation is obtained with @xmath45 ; i.e. eq .",
    "( 3 ) then looses validity because of @xmath51 . for this case @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the markovian friction strength , resulting in @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .    in the unbiased case",
    ", we derive the two - time velocity correlation function ( vcf ) of free generalized brownian motion in a generic form , i.e. , @xmath57 here we used only the condition : @xmath58 .",
    "note that depending on the specific choice for the initial preparation this velocity correlation generally is not time - homogeneous .",
    "the stationary velocity correlation function becomes again only a function of @xmath59 for the case that we use the equilibrium preparation with an initial velocity variance in accordance with the thermal equilibrium value , i.e. @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the deduced asymptotic stationary vcf then reads : @xmath61 .",
    "this causes a breakdown of the ergodic equilibrium state because of the initial preparation - dependence , which is encoded in the @xmath62-dependent asymptotic results : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "likewise , the mean square displacement ( msd ) of the force - free particle is written as @xmath65 where the fourth term denotes the effect of initial coupling between system and heat bath .",
    "we will discuss the correlation preparation in the following section .",
    "note that here the largest power in the temporal variation of the msd involves the square of time .",
    "the averaged displacement can be related to the msd via the generalized einstein relation , reading @xmath66 the _ ballistic _ diffusion coefficient is @xmath67 , being related to the increasing rate of linear mobility @xmath68 . here",
    ", this effective temperature formally reads : @xmath69 , where @xmath8 is the temperature for the common case with @xmath45 .    to assure the equilibrium behavior of this generalized brownian motion the usual condition of kubo s fdt of the second kind for the thermal noise",
    "must be complemented as follows : consider the fourier transform @xmath70 of the memory damping kernel , i.e. , @xmath71 the real part of the former quantity is the spectral density of noise .",
    "a ballistic diffusion with @xmath72 thus requires that the lowest power of @xmath23 is of first - order in @xmath73 , implying that the lowest power of re@xmath70 is proportional to @xmath74 at low frequencies .",
    "therefore , for a genuine thermal noise driven , force - free particle approaching at the equilibrium state the usual conditions must be completed by : @xmath75 , or @xmath76 .",
    "starting from the system - plus - reservoir model , one knows that the coupling between the system and environmental degrees of freedom there exist four kinds of coupling forms which do not involve a renormalization of potential or mass of the system . in these cases",
    "the heat bath consists of a set of independent harmonic oscillators with masses @xmath77 and oscillation frequencies @xmath78 .",
    "pervious work @xcite has shown that the random force is _ independent _ of the system variables for the coordinate - velocity coupling . nevertheless , however",
    ", the expression of thermal noise will depend on the initial preparation of system for the coupling between the system coordinate ( velocity ) and the environmental coordinates ( velocities ) considered here . to the best of our knowledge , only a small number of prior studies @xcite have considered the general consequences of the detailed initial preparation procedure in view of the asymptotic statistical results of the system .      for a bilinear coupling between the system coordinate @xmath79 and the heat bath s coordinates @xmath80 ,",
    "the total hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath81\\;.\\ ] ] here and below the momenta of the system and bath s oscillators are related to @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , and the set @xmath84 denote the coupling constants .",
    "the equation of motion of the system obeys the form of the gle ( 1 ) and the thermal noise appearing in eq .",
    "( 1 ) emerges as @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 is determined by the initial coordinates and the velocities of the oscillators of the heat bath .",
    "the bath part @xmath87 of the noise explicitly reads : @xmath88    physically , this thermal noise @xmath89 obeys statistical properties that derive from the canonical , thermal equilibrium distribution of the total , combined system - plus - bath @xcite : this thermal noise then again yields a vanishing mean and its correlation obeys the thermal fdt @xcite .",
    "the statistical quantities involving noise the system variables are strictly determined by the joint probability @xcite .",
    "the correlation involving initial position of the system and the thermal noise @xmath90 , i.e. , the fourth term in eq .",
    "( 8) reads @xmath91 wherein @xmath92 denotes the convolution integral .",
    "it reads , @xmath93 .",
    "here we have used the relation below eq .",
    "( 2 ) , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "this contribution assumes a finite value , i.e. , @xmath95 in the long - time limit .    under the usual assumption that the thermal noise @xmath4 and the initial velocity @xmath62 of the system are not correlated , we find from eq .",
    "( 12 ) that the initial coordinate of the system must be uncorrelated with its initial velocity for the coordinate - coordinate coupling case , namely , @xmath96 , being the case for a canonical thermal equilibrium , cf .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "therefore , the third term in eq .",
    "( 8) also vanishes . in the following",
    "we shall not consider preparations with such initial correlations between the initial coordinate @xmath3 and the initial velocity @xmath62 .",
    "for a bi - linear coupling between the system velocity and the velocities of the bath oscillators the total hamiltonian reads @xmath97,\\ ] ] where @xmath98 denote the corresponding the coupling constants .",
    "we can derive again the gle ( 1 ) describing the motion of the system with the thermal noise term now given by @xmath99\\nonumber\\\\ & = & v(0)m\\int^t_0\\gamma(t')dt'+\\xi_{\\textmd{bath}}(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and in addition we have : @xmath101 .",
    "we require that the fdt of the second kind is obeyed , namely that @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this is guaranteed when @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 @xcite .    in the case of velocity - velocity coupling , the fourth term in eq .",
    "( 8) vanishes if again @xmath96 .",
    "an additional term emerges , however , for the mean squared displacement ( msd ) of the force - free particle due to the thermal noise @xmath89 which now depends on the initial particle velocity @xmath62 . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath108 indeed , the ballistic diffusion arises also in this case .",
    "notably , an additional contribution to the mean square velocity of the force - free particle [ c.f .",
    "( 7 ) at @xmath109 emerges in this case .",
    "it reads @xmath110 where we have used the inverse laplace transform of the convolution integral in eq . ( 18 ) by making use of the relation , @xmath111 .    in particular , the mean squared velocity of the force - free particle emerges in the long - time limit as @xmath112 this result evidences that the system can not arrive at the equilibrium state for any initial preparation of the particle velocity if @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , for the validity of fdt one has to use at initial time a preparation of thermal equilibrium for the system and the heat bath .",
    "nevertheless , one needs not to worry that the noise is uncorrelated with the initial velocity of the system for a common non - markovian dynamics with @xmath45 .",
    "then , the fdt is valid independent of the coupling form between system and bath whenever the effective markovian damping of the system is finite at zero frequency .",
    "this is so because the first and the third term in eq .",
    "( 19 ) vanishes for @xmath45 .",
    "given the fdt of the second kind by kubo we investigate next unbiased , non - markovian brownian motion in ( 1 ) that is driven by colored noise known as the harmonic velocity noise ( hvn ) @xmath89 @xcite , which , however , does not obey the above additional requirements .",
    "the hvn itself is produced from a linear langevin equation , namely , @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes gaussian white noise of vanishing mean with @xmath115 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath116 denotes the damping coefficient of the system corresponding to the thermal white noise ; @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote the damping and the frequency parameters . the second moments and the cross - variance of @xmath119 and @xmath120 obey : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the laplace transformation of the memory damping kernel reads @xmath124 with @xmath125 respectively .",
    "the latter corresponds to the spectrum of hvn which indeed vanishes identically at zero - frequency . in this case",
    "the dissipation reducing factor emerges as @xmath126 , and likewise , @xmath127 , @xmath128 $ ] .    using models with a bi - linear coordinate system - bath coupling",
    "the dynamics can be characterized by the spectral density of bath modes , @xmath129 , being related to re@xmath130 @xcite .",
    "thus , for a weak coupling to a bath , as it can be realized either with optical - like bath modes @xcite , broadband colored noise @xcite , or also for the celebrated case of a black - body radiation field of the rayleigh - jeans type @xcite the static friction vanishes .",
    "yet other physical situations that come to mind involve the vortex diffusion in magnetic fields @xcite , or open system dynamics with a velocity - dependent system - bath coupling @xcite .    the non - markovian brownian motion",
    "can equivalently be recast as an embedded , higher - dimensional markovian process .",
    "the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the probability density @xmath131 corresponds then to the dynamics of a set of coupled markovian les involving the auxiliary - variables @xmath132 : it obeys @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the associated fpe operator ; when being formally supplemented here with a nonvanishing potential @xmath135 , it explicitly reads : @xmath136    .",

    "@xmath165 is a square - wave periodic driving force that switches forth and back among @xmath166 when @xmath167 and @xmath168 when @xmath169 .",

    "finding is now that this averaged velocity is no longer a constant but rather increases _ linearly _ with time .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the behavior of ordinary brownian motors @xcite .",
    "this _ directed acceleration _ is presented by the slope ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 ) of the average velocity . for a weak rocking ( i. e. small @xmath172 ) the phenomenon of directed motion involves the surmounting of barriers , thus hindering transport .",
    "in contrast , for a strong super - threshold rocking the averaged displacement is related to the mean square displacement via the modified einstein relation in ( 9 ) , yielding @xmath173 in the long - time limit . here",
    "@xmath174 is an effective tilting force stemming from the rocking of the ratchet potential .",
    "amazingly , this brownian motor can be accelerated because the driving and the noise - induced effective tilting force supersedes the acting friction force .",
    "we have researched within the gle - formalism in ( 1 ) an intermediate dynamics proceeding between newton and langevin .",
    "the emerging non - equilibrium features are manifested by the initial preparation - dependent asymptotic stationary state , which is directly related to a non - stokesian dissipative phenomenon which stems from a vanishing effective markovian friction at zero - frequency .",
    "it has been found that the fluctuation - dissipation theory is valid and independent of the coupling form between system and bath when the effective markovian damping is finite at zero frequency . in order to assure the equilibrium behavior of a system , the usual condition for the heat bath , i.e. , the kubo s fluctuation - dissipation theorem of the second kind ,",
    "must be completed by an additional requirement : @xmath175 or @xmath76 , where @xmath23 and @xmath70 are the laplace and fourier transforms of the memory damping .",
    "however , the system can not arrive at the equilibrium state for any initial preparation of the system if the the condition is not obeyed for the bilinear coupling between the system velocity and the velocities of environmental oscillators .",
    "our findings exhibit anomalous super - diffusion in the form of a ballistic diffusion . yet",
    "another riveting result is that the corresponding brownian dynamics for a rocking brownian motor exhibits a distinct , _ accelerated _ velocity , rather than the constant drift which typifies the situation with a stokesian finite zero - frequency dissipation .",
    "we are also confident that our present results will serviceably impact other quantities of thermodynamic and quantum origin .",
    "thus , this field is open for future studies that in turn may reveal further surprising findings .",
