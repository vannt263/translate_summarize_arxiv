    "suddenly there is almost zero intensity at about -0.3 ev .",
    "then in the vicinity of the @xmath30-point intensity rises up again . in the @xmath31 direction around -0.3 ev on the right side of @xmath30-point there is also quite intensive region . at a first glance",
    "one can think that it is the same band with matrix element effects governing intensity .",
    "however based on analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite one can conclude that this low intensity region is the forbidden gap between shadow and quasiparticle bands .",
    "the `` horseshoe '' around @xmath30-point is formed by the shadow band on the left and the quasiparticle band on the right for upper branch and other way round for the lower branch . as a consequence of",
    "that there is also intensive shadow fs sheets around ( @xmath32,0 ) point .",
    "rather intensive nondispersive states at about -1.0 ev within experimental data can be presumably associated with the lower hubbard band and possible admixture of some oxygen states .",
    "let us also suppose that high intensity at -0.3 ev for @xmath30 point may be interpreted not as a van - hove singularity of bare dispersion but rather of high - energy pseudogap branch  @xcite .",

    "one more fascinating comparison for lda+dmft+@xmath20 results with experimental arpes data is recently reported by us in the ref .  @xcite . in fig .",

    "[ fermisurface ] is a color map in reciprocal space of the corresponding spectral function plotted at the fermi level .",
    "fs is clearly visible as reminiscence of non - interacting band close to the first brillouin zone border and around @xmath33 point ( so called fermi arc ) , where the quasiparticle band crosses the fermi level .",
    "there is an interesting physical effect of partial `` destruction '' of the fs observed in the `` hot - spots '' , points that are located at the intersection of the fs and its afm umklapp replica .",
    "this fs `` destruction '' occurs because of the strong electron scattering on the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin ( pseudogap ) fluctuations on the copper atoms .",
    "also the `` shadow '' fs is visible as it should be for afm folding . as no long - range order is present in the underdoped phase the `` shadow '' fs has weaker intensity with respect to fs .",
    "the pcco fs is very similar to that of nd@xmath3ce@xmath7cuo@xmath5 ( ncco ) , which belongs to the same family of supperconductors  @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) [ fermisurface],title=\"fig : \" ] +    let us compare theoretical ( upper panels ) and experimental ( lower panels ) energy quasiparticle dispersion for most characteristic cuts introduced in fig .",
    "[ fermisurface ] ( see fig .  [ cuts ] ) .",

    "( upper panels  theoretical data , lower panels  experimental photoemission intensity ) . to judge about the absolute intensities of the `` shadow '' ( 1 ) and main band ( 2 ) cut 1 contains an mdc curve integrated in an energy window 60 mev centered at the fermi level ( fl ) . similarly integral edc for cut 2 ( `` hot - spot '' ) shows suppression of the intensity at the fl as compared to cut 3 , which is located further away from the `` hot - spot '' .",
    "@xcite ) the fl is zero.[cuts ] ]    the cut 1 intersects quasiparticle and `` shadow '' fermi surfaces close to the brillouin zone border .",
    "one can find here a `` fork''-like structure formed by the damped `` shadow '' band ( -0.5 - 0 arb.u . ) and better defined quasiparticle band ( 0.5 - 1 arb.u . ) .",
    "this structure corresponds to preformation of fs cylinder around ( @xmath24,0 ) point .",
    "the cut 2 goes exactly through the `` hot - spot '' .",
    "here we see a strong suppression of the quasiparticle band around the fermi level similar to ncco as shown in fig .",
    "[ ncexp ] .",
    "the cut 3 crosses the fermi arc , where we can see a very well defined quasiparticle band .",
    "however weak intensity `` shadow '' band is also present . for the case of long range afm order and complete folding of electronic structure , fs and its `` shadow '' should form a closed fs sheet around ( @xmath35 , @xmath35 ) point , while in the current case the part of the pocket formed by the `` shadow '' band is not so well defined in momentum space .",
    "as can be seen there is a good correspondence between the calculated and experimental data in terms of the above described behavior , which is also similar to the results reported for nd@xmath3ce@xmath7cuo@xmath5 ( ncco ) in our earlier work.@xcite",
    "here we summarize our recent results on lda+dmft+@xmath20 investigations of pseudogap state for a number of copper high - t@xmath6 compounds .",
    "we considered for the main prototype systems : hole doped ",
    "bi2212  @xcite and lsco  @xcite ; electron doped ",
    "pcco  @xcite and ncco  @xcite . for all compounds",
    "the lda+dmft+@xmath20 calculations show that fermi - liquid behavior is still conserved far away from the `` hot - spots '' ( antinodal direction ) , while the destruction of the fermi surface observed in the vicinity of `` hot - spots '' ( close to nodal direction ) .",
    "this destruction is due to strong scattering of correlated electrons on short - range antiferromagnetic ( pseudogap ) fluctuations .",
    "moreover the origin of clearly observed `` hot - spots '' for electron doped systems ( in contrast to hole doped ones with a fermi arcs only ) is established .",
    "comparison between experimental arpes and lda+dmft+@xmath20 data reveals a good semiquantitative agreement .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results obtained once again support the afm scenario of pseudogap formation not only in hole doped htsc systems@xcite but also in electron doped ones  @xcite .",
