    "sagdig ( ugca 438 , uks 1927177 ) is a faint dwarf irregular galaxy discovered by @xcite and @xcite . in the discovery papers , @xcite and @xcite estimated , using the brightest stars seen in the photographic plates , the distance to this galaxy to be 600 kpc and 1.1 mpc , respectively .",
    "since then sagdig has been considered to be a member of the local group .",
    "it is known that sagdig contains as much as @xmath24 of hi gas @xcite .",
    "in addition , a few h ii regions were detected by @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of an extended h ii region in sagdig has been estimated to be very low , 3% of solar @xcite .",
    "to date there is limited information of stellar populations in sagdig , which was given briefly by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered about 25 carbon stars scattered beyond the body of the galaxy , and estimated the distance to this galaxy using three methods : @xmath25 using the brightest blue stars , @xmath26 using the @xmath27-band luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch , and @xmath28 using the mean @xmath27-band magnitude of the carbon stars .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of stellar populations of sagdig based on deep @xmath0 ccd photometry .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 investigates the morphological structure of sagdig , and section 4 presents the color - magnitude diagrams of sagdig .",
    "sections 5 , 6 and 7 estimate the reddening , distance , and metallicity of sagdig , respectively .",
    "section 8 presents the surface photometry of sagdig and section 9 discusses the group membership , stellar populations , and the brightest stars of sagdig .",
    "finally , summary and conclusion are given in  10 .",
    "@xmath0 ccd images of sagdig were obtained on the photometric night of 1994 october 8 ( ut ) using the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope at mauna kea .",
    "table 1 lists the journal of the observations of sagdig .",
    "a grey scale map of the @xmath29-band ccd image of sagdig is displayed in fig .",
    "1 . the size of the field of view is @xmath30 and the ( @xmath31 binned ) pixel scale of the ccd is 0.44 arcsec pixel@xmath32 .    for the analysis of the data we have divided the field covered by our ccd images into three regions as shown in fig .",
    "1 : the c region which covers the central region ( @xmath33 ) of sagdig , the i region which covers the outer region ( @xmath34 ) of the galaxy , and the f region which represents a control field with the same area of the c region plus i region .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of the stars in the ccd images were derived using dophot @xcite .",
    "these magnitudes were transformed onto the standard system using the standard stars observed during two nights including the same night @xcite .",
    "the transformation equations we derived from the photometry of the standard stars are : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where upper cases and lower cases represent , respectively , the standard system and instrumental system .",
    "@xmath39 represents the air mass .",
    "the rms scatter of the solutions are 0.01  0.02 mag .",
    "the total number of stars which were measured at @xmath29 and at least one other color in the ccd image is @xmath408100 .",
    "table 2 lists @xmath0 photometry of the measured bright stars with @xmath41 mag in the c and i regions of sagdig .",
    "the coordinates x and y in table 2 are given in units of pixel ( = 0.44 arcsec ) , and increase to the east and to the south , respectively .",
    "fig.1 shows that there are many bright foreground stars in the ccd field , which is expected from the galactic position of sagdig ( @xmath42 deg , and @xmath43 deg ) . a strong concentration of much fainter stars than most foreground stars are seen in the c region , which represent sagdig .",
    "the main body of the galaxy is mostly seen inside the c region , and is much elongated along the east - west direction .",
    "it looks like a crescent in the low contrast image .",
    "however , the outer part of the galaxy seen at the faint level extends out to the boundary of the i region .",
    "there are few bright stars which appear to be the members of sagdig in the i region .",
    "instead there are many faint stars seen better in @xmath44 and @xmath27 images of the i region , which are probably old red giant stars as shown later .",
    "a color map created by combining @xmath45 images shows that most stars in the c region are impressively blue , while the faint stars in the i region are mostly yellow to red .",
    "the mean ellipticity and position angle of the entire structure of sagdig were roughly estimated to be @xmath46 and p.a .",
    "= 90 deg , respectively .",
    "therefore sagdig is an elongated galaxy , in the central region of which some bright stars are irregularly distributed .",
    "this kind of structure that some young stars are irregularly distributed against the smooth background of old stellar populations is common among irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "in figs . 2 and 3 we display @xmath29@xmath47 and @xmath27@xmath48 diagrams of 1500 measured stars in the c region , 1570 measured stars in the i region , and 710 measured stars in the f region .",
    "note that the area of the ( c+i)-region in the field is the same as that of the f region so that we can estimate the contamination due to foreground stars by comparing directly the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of each region .",
    "several distinguishable features of the stars in sagdig are seen in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "first , there is a remarkable blue plume of bright stars with @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the c region ( filled circles ) .",
    "there are much fewer blue stars in the i region ( open circles ) than in the c region .",
    "comparison of the c and i regions and the f region in fig .",
    "2 shows that these bright blue stars are mostly members of sagdig .",
    "there are few stars with @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the f region .",
    "the brightest end of the blue plume extends up to @xmath51 mag at @xmath52 .",
    "these stars are mostly massive stars which were formed recently .",
    "stars in the i region are mostly fainter than @xmath53 mag , much fainter than those bright stars in the c region .",
    "this shows that there was much less star formation in the outer part of sagdig recently .",
    "secondly , fig .",
    "3 shows that there is a strong concentration of red stars fainter than @xmath54 mag in the c and i regions in addition to the blue plume at @xmath55 .",
    "most of these red stars are probably old red giant branch ( rgb ) stars of sagdig .",
    "this feature is more clearly visible in the i region than in the c region .",
    "we have estimated the foreground reddening toward sagdig using the color - color diagram of measured bright stars .",
    "4 shows the @xmath47@xmath48 diagram of bright stars with @xmath56 mag ( open squares ) and @xmath57 mag ( filled circles ) and photometric errors smaller than 0.015 mag .",
    "the stars with @xmath57 mag are fainter and farther than the stars with @xmath56 mag , and they have photometric errors larger than the latter . these bright stars are definitely foreground stars , as shown in the color - magnitude diagrams in the previous section . comparing the colors of these stars with the intrinsic relation of dwarfs @xcite in fig",
    "4 , we have derived a reddening value of @xmath58 .",
    "this value is obviously a underestimate for the total reddening toward the sagdig , because these foreground stars are relatively nearby .",
    "the mean magnitudes of the stars in the two groups shown in fig .",
    "4 are @xmath59 mag and @xmath60 mag .",
    "these magnitudes correspond roughly to the distances of 2.5 kpc and 10 kpc , respectively , if we assume these stars are dwarfs ( for which @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 ) .    on the other hand , the reddening value for the position of sagdig derived from the extinction map of our galaxy @xcite is @xmath63 .",
    "this value is much larger than that based on the color - color diagram .",
    "if this value of @xmath63 is adopted , then most measured stars will deviate significantly more from the intrinsic relation represented by the dashed line in fig .",
    "4 . further studies of the reddening for sagdig , for example , using @xmath64 photometry , are needed to resolve this difference . in this study",
    "we adopt the mean value of these two estimates : @xmath1 .",
    "extinction laws given by @xcite are used to calculate the extinctions for other colors for the total - to - selective extinction ratio of @xmath65 : @xmath66 mag and @xmath67 mag .",
    "we estimate the distance to sagdig using the @xmath27 magnitude of the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) , as described in da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) and in lee , freedman , & madore ( 1993 ) .",
    "the @xmath27 magnitude of the trgb is estimated using the @xmath68 diagram in fig . 3 and the luminosity function of red giant stars .",
    "5 shows the @xmath27-band luminosity function of the measured red giant stars in the i region , from which the contribution due to field stars was subtracted .",
    "the i region is more appropriate for measuring the magnitude of the trgb than the c region , because there are much less young bright stars in the i region and because the crowding is much less severe in the i region than in the c region . in fig .",
    "5 , as the magnitude increases , there is a sudden increase at @xmath69 mag in the luminosity function of the i region , which corresponds to the trgb seen in the color - magnitude diagram in fig .",
    "we have also used the edge detecting method described in lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , obtaining the same result as above .",
    "several stars brighter than the trgb are mostly asymptotic giant stars of intermediate age , also seen in other dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the presence of carbon stars of intermediate age discovered by @xcite .",
    "the mean observed color of the trgb is estimated to be @xmath70 .",
    "the bolometric magnitude of the trgb is then calculated from @xmath71 } - 3.81 $ ] .",
    "adopting a value for the metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath72 dex as estimated below , we obtain a value for the bolometric magnitude of @xmath73 mag .",
    "( the mean metallicity of sagdig is not certain as discussed in the next section .",
    "only an upper limit for the mean metallicity is determined : [ fe / h ] @xmath74 dex . however , the result for the distance estimate is not affected much by this because the trgb method is insensitive to the metallicity . ) the bolometric correction at @xmath27 for the trgb is estimated to be bc@xmath75 mag , adopting a formula for the bolometric correction bc@xmath76 = 0.881  0.243@xmath77 . the intrinsic @xmath27 magnitude of the trgb is then given by @xmath78 mag .",
    "finally the distance modulus of sagdig is obtained : @xmath79 mag ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath80 mpc ) for an adopted extinction of @xmath81 mag .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the result obtained using the same method by @xcite , @xmath82 .",
    "we have estimated roughly the mean metallicity of the rgb stars in sagdig using the @xmath48 color of the stars 0.5 mag fainter than the trgb , @xmath83 .",
    "this color is measured from the median value of the observed colors of about 30 red giant branch stars with @xmath84 mag , to be @xmath85 ( m.e . )",
    "the reddening - corrected color is @xmath86 for the adopted reddening .",
    "this value is @xmath87 mag bluer than the mean color of the rgbs in other metal - poor dwarf galaxies such as uks 2323326 and ddo 210 @xcite .",
    "this value is even bluer than the rgb of the metal - poor galactic globular cluster m15 with [ fe / h ] = 2.17 dex , and is beyond the range of calibrator globular clusters for [ fe / h ] ",
    "@xmath83 relation of the rgb .",
    "this result shows that the mean metallicity of the rgb stars in sagdig is lower than [ fe / h ] @xmath88 dex .",
    "the mean color @xmath89 leads to a value for the mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath90 dex , if we use the [ fe / h ] ",
    "@xmath91 relation as it is .",
    "however this estimate is based on the extrapolation of the calibration relation . in fig .",
    "6 we overlayed the locus of the red giant branch of m15 on the @xmath68 diagram of the measured stars in sagdig , shifted according to the distance and reddening of sagdig .",
    "if we adopt the zero reddening for sagdig , the rgb of sagdig will get closer to that of m15 , but still too blue to be in a good agreement ( in this case the metallicity of the rgb is derived to be [ fe / h ] @xmath92 dex ) .",
    "the broadening of the faint part of the rgb is mostly due to the photometric errors , as shown by the error bars in fig .",
    "the very low metallicity of the rgb obtained in this study is consistent with the result derived from the spectroscopy of an extended h ii region in sagdig by skillman et al .",
    "skillman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) found that the metallicity of the hii region is 3% solar , which is in the lowest among the hii regions in known dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus the mean metallicity of the rgb stars in sagdig is very low , and is in the lowest end in the metallicity of known dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to derive reliably the surface photometry of sagdig , because of the presence of several bright foreground stars in the direction of sagdig .",
    "we have obtained the surface photometry of sagdig as follows .",
    "first , we removed in the original ccd images the images of several bright stars which were obviously considered to be foreground stars in the area of sagdig , using imedit in iraf .",
    "then we performed aperture photometry of sagdig using the elliptical annular aperture with ellipticity of 0.5 and p.a .",
    "= 90 deg derived in this study .",
    "the value of the sky background was estimated from the mean intensity of the field region .",
    "the results of surface photometry of sagdig are listed in table 3 and are displayed in fig .",
    "7 . in table",
    "3 @xmath93 presents the mean major radius of an annular aperture , and @xmath94 represents the outer radius of an annular aperture .",
    "7 shows that the surface brightness profiles are almost flat in the central region of the galaxy ( @xmath95 arcsec ) , and follow approximately an exponential law in the outer part ( @xmath96 arcsec ) .",
    "we fit the @xmath0 surface brightness profiles of the inner region of sagdig with single - mass isotropic king models @xcite and those of the outer region with an exponential law in fig .",
    "8 shows that the surface brightness profiles of the inner region are roughly fit by a king model with a core concentration parameter @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 represent the core radius and tidal radius , respectively . the core radius of the inner region is measured to be @xmath100 arcsec = @xmath101 pc .",
    "note that this value is much larger than that listed in mateo ( 1998 ) , 125 pc , which is based on rough estimate from the old data by longmore et al .",
    "( 1978 ) . the core radius of sagdig is found to be similar to those of other dwarf galaxies ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 surface brightness profiles of the outer region ( @xmath102 arcsec ) are fit roughly by an exponential law with a scale length of @xmath103 arcsec = @xmath104 pc .",
    "7(b ) illustrates the surface color profiles of the galaxy .",
    "7(b ) shows that the mean color of the inner region of sagdig , @xmath105 , is blue , which is typical for dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "also the color profiles are bluer in the inner 1 arcmin region than in the outer region , which is due to the presence of blue stars in the inner region of the galaxy .",
    "the properties of the surface brightness and color profiles of sagdig are similar to those of other dwarf galaxies @xcite .    from the data of the surface photometry we have derived several basic parameters of sagdig as follows .",
    "the standard radius and holmberg radius of sagdig are measured to be @xmath106 = @xmath107 arcsec = 330 pc and @xmath108 = @xmath109 arcsec = 610 pc , respectively . the errors in these are measuring errors for which the uncertainty in the photometry was not considered",
    ". therefore these are underestimates of the true errors .",
    "these radii correspond roughly to the boundaries of the c and i regions , respectively , shown in fig .",
    "1 . note that our value for the holmberg radius is slightly larger than the value longmore et al.(1978 ) derived roughly from their photographic plate , @xmath108 = 90 arcsec .",
    "the central surface brightness of sagdig is measured to be @xmath110 mag arcsec@xmath16 , @xmath17 mag arcsec@xmath16 , @xmath111 mag arcsec@xmath16 , and @xmath112 mag arcsec@xmath16 .",
    "the total magnitudes of sagdig within @xmath108 are derived to be @xmath6 mag , @xmath7 mag , @xmath8 mag , and @xmath9 mag , and the corresponding absolute magnitudes are @xmath10 mag , @xmath11 mag , @xmath12 mag , and @xmath13 mag .",
    "@xmath113 total magnitude of sagdig derived in this study , @xmath6 mag , is much brighter than those given by cesarsky et al.(1977 ) and longmore et al.(1978 ) , @xmath114 mag and 14.7 mag , respectively .",
    "we have measured the distance to sagdig to be @xmath115 mpc from the @xmath27-band magnitude of the trgb , which is an accurate distance indicator for resolved galaxies @xcite . from this",
    "the distance of sagdig from the barycenter of the local group is derived to be 1.1 mpc . from the measured heliocentric velocity of this galaxy , @xmath116 km  s@xmath32@xcite ,",
    "the velocity of sagdig from the barycenter of the local group is calculated to be @xmath117 km  s@xmath32@xcite .",
    "this value is much smaller than the upper limit for the boundary of the local group , 60 km  s@xmath32 .",
    "these results show that sagdig is a member of the local group .",
    "we have investigated roughly the properties of young stellar populations seen in fig .",
    "2 using the theoretical isochrones . in fig . 9 , we overlay , in the @xmath118 diagram of sagdig , two isochrones for the metallicities of @xmath119 ( [ fe / h ] =  1.2 dex ) and @xmath120 ( [ fe / h ] =  1.6 dex ) and ages of 40 and 300 myrs given by the padova group @xcite .",
    "we choose first the isochrone with the lowest metallicity , @xmath120 , among the isochrones given by bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which are represented by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "9 . however , the red parts of these isochrones do not match well with the observed stars .",
    "the red stars in sagdig appear to match better the isochones with higher metallicty , @xmath119 as shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    ". 9 shows ( 1 ) that the brightest blue and red stars in sagdig match roughly the blue and red loops of the isochrone with an age of about 40 myrs , and ( 2 ) that the brightest main - sequence at @xmath121 mag ( @xmath122 mag , about 1 mag below the brightest blue supergiants ) indicates an age of about 10 myrs .",
    "these results show that stars were formed as recently as 10 myrs ago in sagdig . on the other hand , a well - developed rgb shown in the @xmath68 diagram of fig .",
    "3 shows that the bulk of the stars in sagdig were formed before a few gyrs ago , and a small number of agb stars above the trgb were probably formed a few gyrs ago .",
    "10 displays the @xmath29 luminosity function of the main - sequence stars with @xmath123 in sagdig .",
    "the luminosity function we derived is incomplete for the faint end , but is reasonably complete for @xmath124 mag .",
    "the bright part of the luminosity function ( @xmath125 mag , @xmath126 mag ) is approximately fit by a line with a logarithmic slope of @xmath127 .",
    "this value of the slope is similar to those of other irregular and spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the integrated h i flux of this galaxy was measured to be @xmath128 jy km  s@xmath32@xcite . with better data for the distance and luminosity obtained in this study ,",
    "we derive an hi mass , @xmath129 @xmath130 , a @xmath113 luminosity , @xmath131 @xmath132 , and a ratio of @xmath133 which is typical for dwarf irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "longmore et al.(1978 ) estimated roughly from the survey plate the magnitude of the brightest blue stars in sagdig to be @xmath134 mag , and used this result to derive the distance to this galaxy , obtaining a value of 1.1 mpc . with our photometry",
    "we can investigate in detail the properties of the brightest stars in this galaxy .    in the @xmath118 diagram of the c and i regions of sagdig ( filled circles and open circles , respectively ) shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is obvious which stars are the three brightest blue stars in sagdig , because there are no foreground stars with @xmath135 mag and @xmath49 in the f region .",

    "the mean observed magnitudes and colors of these three bsgs in sagdig are derived to be , respectively , @xmath136 mag and @xmath137 . the corresponding absolute magnitude and color are @xmath138 mag , @xmath139 .",

    "but the magnitude and color of these objects show strongly that these objects are the members of sagdig .",
    "further spectroscopy is needed to identify the class of these objects .",
    "if we omit 3124 and 3652 as the bsgs , then the three bsgs will be 3039 , 3897 and 3694 , which are adopted as the final bsgs in this study .",

    "we searched for the exciting source of shk3 , finding a bright blue star located in the center of shk3 : i d 6313 .",
    "the observed magnitude and color of this star are @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the absolute magnitude and color of this star are @xmath151 mag and @xmath152 , corresponding to o - type dwarf .    on the other hand , it is not easy to select the three brightest red stars ( called rsg ) in sagdig , because the heavy contamination due to foreground stars is severe in the red region of the cmds .",
