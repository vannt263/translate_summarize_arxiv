    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model was proposed as a microscopic model to describe the low energy physics of high temperature superconductors .",
    "it mimics the doped cuo@xmath7 planes found in high temperature superconductors by a system consisting of mobile holes moving in a spin background on a two - dimensional square lattice.@xcite one possible mechanism for superconductivity is the bose - einstein condensation of `` preformed '' hole pairs . to see whether this is possible",
    ", first we have to understand how the holes interact .",
    "it is well - known that a mobile hole causes frustration in the antiferromagnetic spin background .",
    "longer range interaction between the holes must be mediated through the spin distortion they produce .",
    "various studies@xcite seem to indicate that in the `` realistic '' parameter range @xmath80.4 , the holes form bound pairs in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "theoretically this can be understood as resulting from the magnon exchange interaction which selects the @xmath2 channel over others.@xcite alternatively , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach has been used to work out the spin structure in the vicinity of a hole pair in real space.@xcite it was found that by pairing up at a distance of @xmath9 , the two holes can share the spin frustration and is therefore energetically favorable .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical observation@xcite that the holes have the largest probability of being at @xmath9 apart .",
    "later it was shown that such pairing of holes at @xmath9 arises naturally if the wavefunction has @xmath2 symmetry.@xcite but in order to firmly establish the role of @xmath10-wave hole pairing in the theory of superconductivity , one has to understand how strong and robust the pairing is .",
    "in fact numerical study@xcite has shown that the binding energy of the @xmath10 channel is negative but small , and that the holes may not be tightly bound in real space .",
    "recently the question on the robustness of @xmath10-wave pairing was addressed by using the anisotropic @xmath0-@xmath11 model as the starting point.@xcite it concluded that different mechanisms may select states with different symmetries and their competition may destroy the @xmath10-wave ground state .",
    "this raises doubt on the robustness of the @xmath10-wave ground state because it is known that the @xmath0-@xmath1 model alone is not enough to explain fully the hole dynamics of sr@xmath7cuo@xmath7cl@xmath7 measured by angle - resolved photoemission.@xcite in order to reproduce the measured spectral functions , one has to add longer - range hole hopping terms ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a three - site hopping term ) to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model hamiltonian.@xcite    motivated by the above discussion , we study the low energy states of the two - hole @xmath0-@xmath1 model with different symmetries using exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "previous ed studies were mostly performed on square lattices of 16 , 20 , and 26 sites .",
    "since we are focusing on the symmetry of the wavefunctions , the geometry of the lattice is very important .",
    "for example , it is well - known that on the 16-site ( @xmath14 ) lattice the system has spurious degeneracy at the wavevectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the 32-site lattice is free from these spurious effects .",
    "the @xmath2 state of the two - hole model on the 32-site lattice has been studied in ref .  .",
    "besides , previous works have indicated that there is a @xmath4-wave state whose energy is very close to that of the @xmath2 state at realistic values of @xmath5.@xcite the existence of this low energy state casts doubt on the robustness of the @xmath2 state as the ground state of the two - hole model .",
    "the energy difference is so small that any additional terms in the hamiltonian may change the ground state from one to another .",
    "this cross - over may be realized by adding longer range hopping terms mention above to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that such terms favor the @xmath4-wave state.@xcite this shows that the physics of the low - lying @xmath4 state may not be irrelevant .",
    "therefore it is important to understand the similarities and differences between the properties of the @xmath2 and the @xmath4 states . in a previous publication@xcite",

    "the properties of these states will be compared at the realistic value of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we will demonstrate the effects of longer - range hopping and short - range coulomb repulsion on the symmetry of the ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the projected fermion operators , and @xmath20 is the fermion number operator .",
    "we solve this model with two holes on a 32-site lattice using the standard lanczos algorithm . to find the low - energy states , we consider subspaces with different rotational symmetries and momenta .",
    "we concentrate on the rotational symmetries @xmath21 , @xmath4 , and @xmath10 .",

    "[ fig : sisj ] shows our result for the @xmath10 state on a 32-site lattice .",

    "[ fig : sisj]a",

    "these two singlet bonds encourage the holes to hop towards each other because doing so will create two strong nearest - neighbor singlet bonds .",

    "note that this set of hole configurations consistently have larger hole correlation @xmath43 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hh_corr ] . for the other hole configurations where the holes are along the @xmath55 or @xmath56 directions , the characteristics of the spin correlations around the holes are very different .",

    "[ fig : sisj]a , one of these singlet bonds becomes the strong diagonal single bonds , and the other remains as a strong nearest neighbor bond .",

    "such hopping is strongly preferred as shown in the kinetic energy plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : ke ]",
    ". when the holes are at @xmath9 apart , the hopping energy along the four directions are significantly larger . when the holes are far apart ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sisj1]b ) , the spin correlation around the hole does not seem to possess any special feature . the hole hopping energy also decreases rapidly .",
    "however , contrary to a previous study,@xcite when the holes are close to each other , we do not see evidence for dimerization in the vicinity of the holes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer ] we show the spin correlation relative to the undoped value . except at the immediate vicinity of the holes ,",
    "the spin correlation is rather unaffected and there is no clear evidence of dimerization .    next let us consider the low - energy state @xmath35 . as already pointed out before,@xcite the spin correlation in the vicinity of a pair of near - by holes discussed above provides a mechanism for hole binding .",
    "it has also been argued that such spin correlation is a result of the @xmath2 symmetry of the wavefunction.@xcite then it is reasonable to expect that in wavefunctions with other symmetries , such mechanism for hole binding is missing and the holes may be unbound . fig .  [",
    "fig : sisj2 ] seems to support this .",
    "when we compare the @xmath10 and @xmath35 wavefunctions in the same subspace where the holes are at @xmath9 apart ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sisj]a and [ fig : sisj2]a ) , we find striking differences in the spin correlation .",
    "the strong diagonal singlet bond between the holes found in the @xmath10 state does not exist in the @xmath35 state .",
    "the binding mechanism discussed above is therefore missing in the @xmath35 state .",
    "this causes the probability for the hole pairs at @xmath9 apart to be small , as evident from fig .",

    "when the holes are far apart we observe a strong singlet spin pair across each hole ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sisj2]b ) .",

    "this feature is missing in the @xmath10 state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sisj]d ) , where large hole separations are not preferred .",
    "this explains the repulsive nature of the holes in the @xmath35 state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hh_corr ] .",
    "note that this interpretation is also consistent with the hole hopping energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ke]b .",
    "the hopping energy is larger when the holes are farther apart .",
    "[ fig : nq ] shows the electron momentum distribution function ( emdf ) , defined as @xmath57 , for the three low energy states . since in the two - hole model @xmath58",
    ", we will leave out the spin index @xmath59 .",
    "this quantity demonstrates another striking difference between the @xmath10 and @xmath4 states .",
    "previous works@xcite have shown that the general shape of @xmath60 is irrelevant to the structure of the hole pair .",
    "this is evident from the fact that in the two - hole model , @xmath61 is roughly the same as @xmath62.@xcite note that this is true for all the three low - energy states . nevertheless , those * k * along the magnetic brillouin zone boundary [ @xmath16 to @xmath63 are important in reflecting the structure of the bound state.@xcite the deviation of the emdf from the undoped value , @xmath64 , represents the hole weight at that * k*. as already pointed out in ref .   and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nq ] , @xmath60 of the @xmath10 state along the magnetic brillouin zone boundary has a maximum at @xmath15 , and minimum somewhere between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that in the @xmath10 state @xmath60 is symmetric about the line from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , and in the 32-site lattice the two minima in the first quadrant of the brillouin zone are at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . on the contrary ,",
    "in the @xmath4 states the minimum of @xmath67 along the magnetic brillouin zone boundary is at @xmath15 .",
    "note that the symmetry of the @xmath10 state requires the hole weight at @xmath15 to be zero .",
    "hence its @xmath68 deviates from the undoped value of @xmath69 by a minimal value of @xmath70 .",
    "such restriction is lifted in the @xmath4 states and in fact @xmath60 shows that their hole weight is a maximum at @xmath15 .",
    "this feature resembles a hole pocket at @xmath15 .",
    "the fact that the emdf of the @xmath4 states have dimples at momenta corresponding to the single - particle ground state leads us to think that some form of rigid band filling approximation works in the @xmath4 states but not in the @xmath10 state .",
    "this can be accounted for by their different hole - hole correlations in real space . when the holes are farther apart , the overlap in the spin distortions they produce is smaller .",
    "therefore the state can be better approximated by some combination of the single - hole quasiparticle states , thus making the rigid band filling model a better approximation .",
    "next we turn to the spin properties of the three low energy states at @xmath39 .",
    "we first study the static structure factor @xmath71 and the spin correlation function @xmath72 .",
    "they are related by @xmath73 fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ] shows the static structure factors .",
    "all three states show strong characteristics of a nel state ",
    "@xmath71 strongly peaks at @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting to note that while those properties associated with the holes are very different between the @xmath4 and @xmath10 states , their static structure factors are very similar .",
    "as far as the spin property is concerned , the effect of the holes added to the system is to weaken the nel order only , with no qualitative change .",
    "this is also indicated in the spin correlation function @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] .",
    "it is obvious that the spin correlations of the @xmath10 and @xmath35 states have very similar behavior .",
    "if we fit a power law to the data points at @xmath75 , we find that the spin correlation decays as @xmath76 in the @xmath10 state and @xmath77 in the @xmath35 state .",
    "they are to be compared to the spin correlation of the undoped ground state on the same 32-site lattice which decays as @xmath78 .",
    "the spin correlation of the @xmath36 state seems to be of a bit longer range and can not be fitted satisfactorily by a power law .",
    "however , the difference does not show up significantly in the static structure factor .    in the semi - classical theory of shraiman and siggia , a mobile hole produces long - range dipolar distortion in the spin background.@xcite",
    "a consequence is that the holes tend to stay away to minimize the overlap of the spin distortion they produce , resulting in dimples in the emdf at momenta corresponding to the single - hole ground state .",
    "as discussed in the last paragraph of the previous section , the @xmath4 states seem to fit this scenario better than the @xmath10 state .",
    "another consequence of the semi - classical theory is that in the presence of a small number of holes , the system may be unstable towards the spiral phase.@xcite therefore it is interesting to compare the tendency of the @xmath10 and @xmath4 states to have spiral order .",
    "a consequence of the spiral phase is that the maximum of @xmath71 will shift away from @xmath79 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ] , we do not see such pattern in any of the three low - energy states",
    ". however , the shift in * k * may be too small to be detected in our finite lattice with discrete * k*. in previous ed studies of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on smaller lattices , the shift in @xmath71 was not observed until the doping level is much larger.@xcite on the other hand , experiments has demonstrated incommensurability in the magnetic fluctuation.@xcite therefore one should not look for long range order that exists in the thermodynamic limit , but should instead look for short - range spiral order .",
    "for this reason we calculate the twist order parameter which is defined as @xmath80 fig .",
    "[ fig : twist ] shows @xmath81 in the three low energy states .",

    "[ fig : delta2 ] shows that in our system the energies of the @xmath10 and @xmath4 states are very close at @xmath33 .",
    "this casts doubt on whether the @xmath10 state is always the ground state of the two - hole model in the physically relevant range of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the small energy difference means that including additional terms in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model hamiltonian may have profound effect on the selection of the ground state .",
    "this raises the question on the robustness of the @xmath10 state as the ground state . in this section",

    "the repulsions should weaken hole binding and raise the energy of the @xmath10 state .",

    "cr@lcdd symmetry&&spin & & + @xmath10 & ( 0,&0 ) & 0 & -15.588993 & 0.51434 + @xmath21 & ( 0,&0 ) & 0 & -16.074058 & 0.02927 + @xmath4 & ( 0,&0 ) & 1 & -16.080823 & 0.02251 + @xmath4 & ( @xmath97,0),&@xmath98 & 0 & -16.109653 & -0.00632 + @xmath4 & ( @xmath97,&@xmath97 ) & 0 & -16.164444 & -0.06111 +    we can see that the structure of the low - lying energy levels is seriously affected .",
    "first , the energy of the @xmath10 state is pushed up by a lot compared to other states .",
    "its energy is now even higher than an @xmath21 and a ( triplet ) @xmath4 state .",
    "note that in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model these two states have higher energies than the @xmath10 state ( see section [ sec : energy ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , their binding energies are positive . only the two singlet @xmath4 states have negative binding energies .",
    "the @xmath4 state with momentum @xmath23 now becomes the ground state .",
    "note that its binding energy does not differ too much from that of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta2 ] , which is @xmath99 .",
    "we tried to map out the low - lying states of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with two holes on a 32-site square lattice at various @xmath5 . while previous studies have focussed on finding the critical @xmath5 where hole binding is lost , we concentrate on the symmetry of the ground state at different @xmath5 .",
    "we find that at large @xmath5 , the ground state has @xmath2 symmetry as reported before .",
    "but there are low - lying states with @xmath4 symmetry whose energies come closer to the ground state as @xmath5 decreases . at @xmath100 one of these @xmath4-wave",
    "state becomes the ground state .",
    "we note that these @xmath4-wave states have non - zero momenta .",
    "previous numerical works have revealed similar finite momentum states . but calculations carried out on lattices smaller than 32 sites are biased by their geometry . as a result , these finite momentum @xmath4 states have not received much attention . nevertheless , a similar cross - over in the symmetry of the ground state from @xmath10 to @xmath4 symmetry has been reported in a series expansion study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model.@xcite there the cross - over was found to be at @xmath101 , which is quite close to our value of @xmath102 .",
    "this cross - over was also observed in the anisotropic @xmath0-@xmath11 model.@xcite although finite - size effects prevent us from concluding definitely whether this cross - over exists in the thermodynamic limit , the fact that it occurs within the parameter range of interest make us feel that the @xmath4 states are relevant to the low energy physics of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "further investigation reveals qualitative differences and similarities in the properties of the @xmath4 and @xmath10 states .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing is the difference in their hole properties .",
    "the holes are mutually attractive in the @xmath10 state , but are repulsive in the @xmath4 states .",
    "the spin structure in the vicinity of the holes provides an intuitive explanation of the contrasting behaviors . and",
    "as a result of this , the electron momentum distribution functions are also very different . while the emdf of the @xmath10 state shows no sign of hole pockets , that of the @xmath4 states clearly have dimples at @xmath15 .",
    "such hole properties suggest that the rigid - band filling assumption should work better in the @xmath4 than in the @xmath10 state , if it works at all . and in the framework of the semi - classical theory,@xcite one would expect the @xmath4 states to have stronger tendency to show spiral spin order than the @xmath10 state .",
    "however , we do not find any enhancement in the short - range spiral spin correlation in the @xmath4 states over the @xmath10 state .",
    "in fact the spin correlations of the @xmath10 and @xmath4 states are very similar and show signals of the nel state .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the @xmath2 ground state is not robust .",
    "it can be destroyed easily by including realistic terms to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model hamiltonian . both the short - range coulomb repulsion and longer range hopping terms ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) favor the @xmath4 state with momentum @xmath23 as the ground state .",
    "this shows that hole pairing in the @xmath2 channel may not be a generic feature of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "there is a competing @xmath4 state which has no hole pairing .",
    "the implication of our result is that the symmetry of the two - hole ground state of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is yet to be determined .",
    "this is in contrary to a recent numerical study@xcite which concludes that pairing in the @xmath2 channel is a robust property of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
