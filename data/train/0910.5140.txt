    "it is well known that a potential difference @xmath0 is observed on a segment @xmath1 ( with a resistance @xmath2 ) of an asymmetric conventional metal loop @xmath3 ( with a resistance @xmath4 ) when a circular current @xmath5 is induced by the faraday s voltage @xmath6 in this loop . on the other hand",
    "the magnetization measurements give evidence a circular direct current observed in semiconductor [ 1 ] normal metal [ 2 ] and normal state of superconductor [ 3 ] nano - structures in a constant magnetic field , i.e. without the faraday s voltage @xmath7 .",
    "the observed periodical change of the magnetization with magnetic field at the period corresponding to the flux quantum for single electron @xmath8 or pair @xmath9 gives unambiguous evidence that this equilibrium quantum phenomenon , as well as flux quantization in superconductor [ 4 ] , is a consequence of the persistent current @xmath10 existing because of the quantization of the velocity circulation @xmath11 but in contrast to the flux quantization observed as far back as 1961 [ 5 ] the experimental results [ 1 - 3 ] give evidence of the persistent current along the loop with non - zero resistance @xmath12 .",
    "the persistent current at @xmath12 was predicted as far bag as 1970 both in normal state @xmath13 of superconductor [ 6 ] and in non - superconductor mesoscopic structures [ 7 ] .",
    "it was written in [ 7 ] and the later theoretical works [ 8,9 ] have corroborated that the persistent current can be observed at electron scattering ( at a finite mean free path @xmath14 ) , i.e. at non - zero dissipation .",
    "thus , the persistent current can be observed at non - zero dissipation like conventional circular current .",
    "nevertheless most experts are fully confident that a potential difference @xmath15 can not be observed on a segment @xmath1 when the persistent current @xmath10 is observed along the asymmetric mesoscopic loop with non - homogeneous dissipation @xmath16 along its circumference @xmath3 .",
    "the observation [ 10 ] of the quantum oscillation of the dc voltage @xmath17 on a system of aluminum loops in the temperature region corresponding to the superconducting resistive transition , i.e. at @xmath12 , call this confidence in question .     the superconducting resistive transition of the nano - structure containing 1050 asymmetric aluminum loops with diameter @xmath18 written at the measuring current with different values @xmath19 .",
    "the inset shows the quantum oscillation of the dc voltage @xmath20 induced by the external as current with the frequency @xmath21 and the amplitude @xmath22 at the temperature @xmath23 corresponding to superconducting state of this nano - structure . ]",
    "the persistent current observed in normal state of superconductor and non - superconductor ( semiconductor and normal metal ) has seminar nature and the theorists demonstrate this likeness .",
    "kulik made the theory of the persistent current in non - superconductor nano - structure [ 7 ] just after the work [ 6 ] on this phenomenon in normal state of superconductor and in twenty years f. von oppen and e. k. riedel have calculated the flux - periodic persistent current in mesoscopic superconducting rings close to @xmath24 [ 11 ] after the calculation of the disorder - averaged persistent current for a non - superconductor mesoscopic ring [ 9 ] .",
    "the persistent current can be observed in a loop when the wave function of electron or superconducting condensate is closed now and again in this loop .",
    "therefore the persistent current can have an appreciable value only if the mean free path @xmath14 is not smaller than the loop length @xmath3 [ 8,9 ] .    in the superconducting state",
    "the mean free path of pairs is infinite @xmath25 and the persistent current has a value @xmath26 much large then in a non - superconductor loop @xmath27 [ 8,9 ] .",
    "although the fermi velocity exceeds the pair velocity @xmath28 determined by the relation ( 1 ) the pair number @xmath29 in any real loop is so great at @xmath30 that @xmath31 . because of the large @xmath32 value",
    "the quantum oscillation of the dc voltage @xmath20 with high amplitude can be observed at @xmath30 , fig.1 .",
    "but because of zero resistance @xmath33 an external ac current with the amplitude @xmath34 exceeding the superconducting critical current @xmath35 should be applied at @xmath30 [ 12 ] .",
    "the little - parks oscillations of the resistance @xmath36 reduced to the one in the normal state @xmath37 measured on two nano - structures containing aluminum loops with diameter @xmath18 ( the upper curve ) and @xmath38 ( the lower curve ) demonstrate the increase of the amplitude of the superconducting transition shift @xmath39 in magnetic field with the loop decrease . ]",
    "such switching between quantum states with different connectivity of the wave function can induce a potential difference @xmath40 on segment of an asymmetric loop [ 14,15 ] .",
    "it is expected that its value in the normal state @xmath13 may be larger than in non - superconductor loop since the @xmath32 value in the first case [ 3 ] is larger than in the second one [ 1,2 ] .",
    "the persistent current @xmath41 increases with the loop length @xmath42 decrease .",
    "but at a too small loop @xmath43 the switching between states with different connectivity of the wave function becomes impossible [ 14 ] because of the critical temperature shift @xmath44 [ 16 ] . here",
    "@xmath45 is the superconductor coherence length at @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the width of the superconducting transition .",
    "our measurements have corroborated the @xmath48 amplitude increase with the @xmath49 loop decrease , fig.2 .",
    "we have found that @xmath50 at the diameter of our aluminum loop @xmath51 .",
    "we intend to present results of the @xmath17 measurements on nano - structures with great number of such loops , fig.3 .",
    "it may be these results will answer on the question on a possibility to observe the like phenomenon in semiconductor and normal metal loops .",
