    "biological lipids in solution display several different lyotropic phases , and the implications this may have for biological function has been a subject of speculation for many years ( cullis et al . , 1985 ;",
    "de kruijff 1997 ) .",
    "lipid phase behavior depends upon several factors , some of which are intrinsic to the lipid architecture itself .",
    "for example , an increase in the length of the hydrocarbon tails brings about transitions from lamellar , @xmath0 , to inverted hexagonal , @xmath1 , phases ( seddon , 1990 ) , while an increase in the volume of the headgroup brings about the reverse ( gruner , 1989 ) .",
    "other factors regulating phase behavior are externally controlled , such as temperature , solvent concentration , and solvent ph ( hope and cullis , 1980 , seddon et al .",
    ", 1983 , bezrukov et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "it is these factors which are the focus of this paper .",
    "lipid phase behavior has been addressed extensively by the construction of phenomenological free energy functions which contain terms describing , _ inter alia _ ,",
    "bending , hydration , and interstitial energies ( helfrich , 1973 ; kirk et al . ,",
    "1984 ; rand and parsegian , 1989 ; kozlov et al . ,",
    "such approaches , which obtain their several parameters from experimental measurement of various quantities , are quite useful , particularly in correlating phase behavior with other thermodynamic properties .",
    "nonetheless , it would clearly be desirable to derive all thermodynamic quantities , including the phase behavior , by applying statistical mechanics to a microscopic model of the system .",
    "in addition to simplifying the description considerably , such approaches would correlate phase behavior with the the architectural properties of the lipid itself and its solvent .",
    "analytic , mean - field , approaches of statistical mechanics have been applied to anhydrous lipids to investigate behavior of increasing complexity .",
    "such methods have been combined with realistic models of lipid tails to determine how the hydrocarbon chains pack in aggregates and in bilayers ( marcelja , 1974 ; gruen , 1981 and 1985 ; ben - shaul et al .",
    "1985 ; fattal and ben - shaul , 1994 ) .",
    "results for the bilayer are in good agreement with molecular dynamic simulation ( heller et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "these methods have shown that in a neutral , anhydrous system , the entropy of the lipid tails always favors the @xmath1 over the @xmath0 phase , and that a change in area per headgroup could bring about a transition between them ( steenhuizen et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "aggregates , such as the lipid bilayer , in the presence of solvent have also been considered within the mean - field approach applied to lattice models ( leermakers and scheutjens , 1988 ) .",
    "in addition to the tails , one must now model the solvent and the headgroups , and phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine headgroups are among those which have been described ( meijer et al .",
    "the method is flexible and has been applied to many different systems , including bilayers with trans - membrane guest molecules ( leermakers et al . ,",
    "results are quite good , with the exception that the local volume fraction of solvent inside the bilayer is rather large , several orders of magnitude greater than that observed in experiment ( jacobs and white , 1989 ) . lattice models , however , are not well - suited to the description of transitions between phases of different symmetry .",
    "recently similar methods were applied to a system of solvent and monoacyl lipid embedded in a continuous space , and the phase diagram was obtained by solving the mean - field theory exactly ( mller and schick , 1998 ) .",
    "it displayed both @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases , so that the transition between them could be studied as a function of lipid architecture .",
    "the dependence of the transition on the architectural parameters , length of tail and volume of headgroup , was that observed in experiment .",
    "the fraction of solvent within the bilayers was again too large .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a computationally more tractable model of a lipid than that employed by mller and schick , one whose hydrocarbon tails are modeled as flexible chains rather than within the rotational isomeric states framework ( flory , 1969 ; mattice and suter , 1994 ) employed earlier .",
    "we first study the model with an uncharged headgroup .",
    "its phase behavior , both with respect to variations in architecture and variations in solvent concentration , is as expected , and in agreement with experiment .",
    "in particular , choosing model parameters appropriate to dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine ( dope ) , we obtain a phase diagram similar to that observed ( gawrisch et al .",
    "1992 , kozlov et al .",
    "we extract the variation with temperature and solvent concentration of the lattice parameter of the inverted hexagonal phase , and compare it to experiment ( tate and gruner , 1989 , rand and fuller , 1994 ) .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "we also find that the concentration of solvent within the bilayer is vanishingly small .",
    "we then allow the headgroup to be negatively charged , introduce counter ions into the system , and include the coulomb interaction between all charges .",
    "we show that the coulomb repulsion between the headgroups does _ not _ tend to stabilize the @xmath0 phase at the expense of the @xmath1 , but has the _ opposite _ effect .",
    "lastly we turn on a short - ranged interaction between charges and neutral solvent , an interaction which models the thermally averaged interaction between charges and the dipole of water .",
    "we then find that as the charge on the headgroup is turned on , the @xmath0 phase _ is _ stabilized with respect to the @xmath1 . in effect , as the charge on the headgroup increases , so too do the waters of hydration .",
    "in addition , the counter ions which are attracted to the headgroup are also enlarged by their own waters of hydration .",
    "it is the totality of these waters which effectively increases the headgroup volume and therefore stabilizes the lamellar phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the model for the charged lipid , the solvent , and counter ions , specify all the interactions between them and set up the partition function of the system . in section iii",
    ", we derive the self - consistent field theory for it . at the heart of the theory",
    "are four self - consistent equations for the electrostatic potential of the system and the three effective fields which determine the headgroup , tail , and solvent densities .",
    "one of these self - consistent conditions is simply the non - linear poisson - boltzmann equation . in section iv",
    ", we expand all functions of position into a complete set of functions having a specified space - group symmetry , and rewrite the self - consistent equations in terms of the coefficients of these expansions .",
    "these equations are solved numerically , and the free energies of the various phases computed .",
    "a comparison of the free energies yields the phase diagram . in section",
    "v , we present the phase diagram for the neutral lipid as a function of temperature and one architectural parameter .",
    "we include here only the classical phases , lamellar , inverted and normal hexagonal , and inverted and normal body - centered - cubic , as well as the disordered phase . for the remainder of the section , we choose an architecture such that the anhydrous , neutral lipid orders into the @xmath1 phase .",
    "results for the system in the presence of a neutral solvent , along with comparisons to experiment , are presented next .    in section",
    "vi , we consider the charged lipid .",
    "we choose a water concentration such that the neutral lipid remains in the @xmath1 phase . by varying the counter ion concentration , we turn on the charge on the headgroup , and thus all coulomb interactions , but we keep the short - ranged interaction between charges and neutral solvent set to zero . we show that the @xmath1 phase is stabilized with respect to the @xmath0 rather than destabilized , a result completely analogous to that of polyelectrolytes ( nyrkova et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "lastly we present our results for the case in which , in addition to the coulomb interaction , a short - ranged interaction between charges and solvent is turned on . here",
    "we find that the @xmath0 is indeed stabilized with respect to the @xmath1 phase , in agreement with experiment ( hope and cullis , 1980 , bezrukov et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "we consider a system composed of charged lipids , neutral solvent , and counter ions in a volume @xmath2 .",
    "there are @xmath3 lipids , each of which consists of a head , with volume @xmath4 , and two equal length , completely flexible , tails each consisting of @xmath5 segments of volume @xmath6 .",
    "each lipid tail is characterized by a radius of gyration @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the statistical segment length .",
    "the heads carry a negative charge @xmath9 .",
    "the solvent consists of @xmath10 neutral particles of volume @xmath11 , while the @xmath12 counter ions have charge @xmath13 and negligible volume , @xmath14 .",
    "there are five dimensionless densities which totally specify the state of the system ; the number density of the headgroups , @xmath15 , of the tail segments , @xmath16 , and of the solvent , @xmath17 , and the charge density of the headgroups , @xmath18 , and of the counter ions , @xmath19 .",
    "they can be written as @xmath20 we have chosen @xmath4 as a convenient volume to make all densities dimensionless . in the above , @xmath21 is the position of the @xmath22th solvent particle , and @xmath23 the position of the @xmath24th counter ion .",
    "the configuration of the @xmath25th lipid is described by a space curve @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ranges from 0 , at the end of one tail , through @xmath28 at which the head is located , to @xmath29 , the end of the other tail .",
    "the nominal probability that the charge on the headgroup of the @xmath25th lipid , @xmath30 , is equal to @xmath31 or 0 is @xmath32 or @xmath33 respectively . as we model the case in which charges can associate or disassociate from the headgroup , it will be necessary to average the partition function of the system with respect to the charge distribution .",
    "this corresponds to an annealed distribution in the nomenclature of borukhov ( borukhov et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the concentrations of lipid , solvent , and free counter ions are controlled by chemical potentials .",
    "in particular , increasing the number of _ free _ , positive , counter ions implies , by charge neutrality , an increase in the negative charge on the headgroups , and thus corresponds to an increase in the ph of the system .",
    "the interactions among these elements are as follows .",
    "first there is a repulsive , contact interaction between headgroup and tail segments , and also between solvent and tail segments .",
    "the strength of the interaction is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath36 the absolute temperature .",
    "second there is the coulomb interaction between all charges .",
    "the dielectric constant of the solvent is denoted @xmath37 .",
    "finally there is a contact interaction between all charges and the neutral solvent whose strength is @xmath38 .",
    "this is to model the short - ranged , thermally averaged , interaction between charges and the dipole of water , an attractive interaction which decreases like @xmath39 and is of strength @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the dipole moment of water ( israelachvili , 1985 ) .",
    "thus the energy per unit volume of the system , @xmath42 , can be written @xmath43&= & 2\\chi n\\int{d{\\bf r } \\over v}[\\hat\\phi_h({\\bf r})+\\hat\\phi_s({\\bf r } ) ] \\hat\\phi_t({\\bf r})\\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\beta^*\\over 8\\pi}\\int { d{\\bf r}\\over    v}{d{\\bf r'}\\over r_g^2 }    [ \\hat p_h({\\bf r})+\\hat p_c({\\bf r})]{1\\over |{\\bf r}-{\\bf r'}| } [ \\hat p_h({\\bf r'})+\\hat p_c({\\bf r'})]\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\lambda\\int { d{\\bf r}\\over v}\\hat\\phi_s({\\bf r})[\\hat p_c({\\bf r})-\\hat p_h({\\bf    r})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a dimensionless measure of the strength of the coulomb interaction .",

    "the notation @xmath50 denotes an integral over the probability distribution of the charge on the headgroup of the @xmath25th lipid .",
    "we have enforced an incompressibility constraint on the system with the aid of the delta function @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the latter parameter is the lipid architectural parameter .",
    "the relative volume of the headgroup with respect to that of the entire molecule is @xmath54 .",
    "the model is now completely defined .",
    "the solvent is specified by @xmath55 , its volume per particle relative to that of the headgroup , and the architecture of the lipid is characterized by @xmath56 .",
    "there are three interactions , hydrophobic - hydrophilic , charge - charge , and charge - solvent , whose strengths are given by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the external parameters are the temperature , conveniently specified in terms of a dimensionless temperature @xmath60 , the fugacity of the solvent , @xmath61 , and the fugacity of the free counter ions , @xmath62 , which , by charge neutrality , controls the charge on the lipid headgroups .",
    "the characteristic length in the system is the radius of gyration , @xmath63 . in the next two sections we derive the self consistent field theory for the model , first in real space , and then in the following section , in fourier space",

    "the single minimum that one finds normally is sharp , that is , the free energy varies rather rapidly with @xmath127 . only in cases in which phases are greatly swollen",
    "is the minimum extremely shallow and difficult to locate .",
    "we first apply our method to a neutral lipid . we show here",
    "the phase behavior of the neutral lipid , in the absence and in the presence of solvent .",
    "figure 1 shows the phase diagram of the pure lipid as a function of the dimensionless temperature @xmath147 , and the architecture of the lipid .",
    "the latter is characterized by the single parameter @xmath54 which is the relative volume of the headgroup to that of the entire lipid .",
    "it is analogous to , but not the same as , the single parameter used by israelachvili to characterize the geometry of lipids ( israelachvili , 1985 ) . shown",
    "are the lamellar phase , @xmath0 , the normal and inverted hexagonal phases , @xmath148 and @xmath1 , and the normal and inverted body - centered cubic phases @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the occurrence of bicontinuous phases will be discussed in a later paper .",
    "one sees that the phase behavior is reasonable and in accord with packing considerations ; as the headgroup increases in volume , the system passes through a series of phases from the inverted ones with most curvature , through the lamellar phase , to the normal ones of most curvature .",
    "we also note that as the temperature increases , the lamellar phase becomes unstable to one or the other of the hexagonal phases .",
    "this is very clear for the @xmath148 phase , less so for the @xmath1 phase , but is true for the latter over much of the temperature range as the slope of the @xmath151 phase boundary is slightly positive below @xmath147 of about 0.045 .",
    "this transition with temperature is well known in the analogous case of diblock copolymers ( leibler , 1980 ) . in order to model a lipid which , like phosphatidylserine , adopts the @xmath1 configuration when essentially neutral ( cullis et al .",
    "1985 , bezrukov et al . , 1999 ) , we have chosen @xmath152 in our subsequent studies . for comparison , the value appropriate for dope , calculated from the molecular volumes in the literature ( rand and fuller , 1994 ) is @xmath153 . for the convenience of the reader interested in carrying out similar calculations , we present in table i the values of the first three non - trivial fourier components of the headgroup density @xmath102 , the lattice parameter @xmath154 , and the free energy @xmath155 for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath150 phases at @xmath156 .",
    "we note , in passing , that the relative intensities of x - ray bragg peaks can be determined directly from the fourier components of the various densities with which they are associated .    the effect on this neutral lipid of the addition of a solvent of small volume , characterized by @xmath157 , close to the value of @xmath158 ( rand and fuller , 1994 ; kozlov et al . ,",
    "1994 ) appropriate to water and a phosphatidylethanolamine headgroup , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . there is a lamellar phase at small solvent volume fractions and low temperatures .",
    "this phase becomes unstable with respect to the @xmath1 phase which envelops it at higher temperatures .",
    "there is a large region of two - phase coexistence between the ordered lipid - rich phases and an almost pure solvent phase .",
    "these features are reasonable , and are observed in the systems of aqueous dialkyl didodecylphosphatidylethanolamine and of diacyl diarachinoylphosphatidylethanolamine ( seddon et al , 1984 ) . of particular interest",
    "is that we find a small temperature region of re - entrant hexagonal - lamellar - hexagonal transitions , an unusual feature which has been observed in dope ( gawrisch et al .",
    "1992 , kozlov et al .",
    "1994 ) . as a consequence",
    ", there is an azeotrope at which the transition between lamellar and hexagonal phases occurs without a change in the concentration of water .",
    "we have used the coordinates of this point , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , denoted @xmath161 and @xmath162 , to normalize the temperature and solvent - density axes .",
    "there is a small region of @xmath150 in our phase diagram .",
    "again , the possible occurrence of bicontinuous phases will be examined in a later publication .",
    "the uncertainty in the temperature of the phase boundaries , @xmath163 introduced by the truncation of the number of basis functions , is approximately @xmath164 .",
    "as the volume fraction of water is increased , we find that the period of all structures increases , as is expected . in fig .",
    "3 , we compare experimental results on dope taken in the inverted hexagonal phase at a temperature @xmath165 , just above that of the azeotrope ( rand and fuller , 1994 ) , to our values calculated just above the azeotrope . knowing the molecular weight of dope , we convert the volume fraction of solvent , @xmath166 , which occurs in the calculation , to the experimental variable of weight fraction of water .",
    "the lattice parameter of the hexagonal phase in the calculation , however , is measured in units of the radius of gyration of either lipid tail .",
    "what value should be taken to model dope is unknown .",
    "hence we have used in the comparison the lattice parameter @xmath127 , in units of @xmath167 , the lattice parameter at the azeotrope .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "an effective value of the radius of gyration can be defined as that value which brings agreement between the calculated and measured lattice parameters . as",
    "the former , at the azeotrope , is @xmath168 , and the latter is 58.9  ( rand and fuller , 1994 ) , the equivalent radius of gyration at the temperature of the azeotrope , @xmath169 , is 12.3  for a single tail , not unreasonable when compared to the extended length of a single chain of dope which is approximately 26 .    as the temperature of the system is lowered , the period of all structures increases , which is due to the lengthening of the tails as their entropy decreases .",
    "we would again like to compare our results with those of the dope system . in order to do so",
    ", we must address the temperature dependence of the radius of gyration , @xmath63 , which appears in the theory , and which is not given _",
    "a priori_. because the model chain is flexible , the radius of gyration is related to the mean square end - to - end distance , @xmath170 , by a numerical constant , @xmath171 , so their dependence on temperature is the same . to compare our results to dope",
    ", we shall assume that the temperature dependence of the radius of gyration which appears in the calculation is the same as that given for lipid chains by the rotational isomeric states model , a model which describes the properties of such chains very well ( flory , 1969 ; mattice and suter , 1994 ) .",
    "thus we assume @xmath172 where the angle @xmath173 takes the values @xmath174 and @xmath175 corresponding to @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 configurations , and @xmath179 is a constant .",
    "the statistical average of @xmath180 is @xmath181 with @xmath182 and @xmath183k . from the behavior with temperature of @xmath184 ,",
    "the lattice parameter , @xmath185 , at any temperature can be obtained from @xmath186\\over [ d(t_0)/r_g(t_0 ) ] } { r_g(t)\\over r_g(t_0)}.\\ ] ] again , it is the factor @xmath187 which occurs naturally in the calculation .",
    "a comparison of the experimentally measured ( tate and gruner , 1989 ) and theoretically calculated lattice parameters _ vs. _ temperature is shown in fig .",
    "4 . in part",
    "( a ) , the variation of the parameter of the @xmath1 is shown at two different lipid weight fractions .",
    "the agreement is very good . in part ( b ) , the comparison is made of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 parameters along the coexistence with excess water .",
    "note that this comparison is a much more stringent test , for it requires not only that the dependence of the lattice parameters on solvent concentration and on temperature be reproduced well by the calculation , but also that the phase boundaries be given well .",
    "considering these requirements , the agreement is rather good .",
    "it should be noted that the agreement in 4(b)does not depend on the exact temperature of the triple point , which is difficult to locate precisely , but only on the existence of stable @xmath1 and @xmath0 phases which coexist with excess water .    as seen in fig .",
    "4(b ) , the lattice parameter of the @xmath1 phase is much larger than that of the @xmath0 at the triple point .",
    "this is due to the coexistence with excess solvent , which swells the hexagonal cores , but which is only weakly present between the lamellae .",
    "in contrast , when the lamellar and hexagonal phases are only in two - phase coexistence with one another and there is no excess solvent , the hexagonal phase in general has a smaller lattice parameter than the coexisting lamellar phase , as shown in fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that over almost all of their coexistence region , the @xmath1 phase has a smaller volume fraction of solvent than does the @xmath0 phase , as can be seen from the phase diagram of fig .",
    "2 . only over the re - entrant region , which occurs as the triple point is approached , does this balance shift .",
    "this shift in the relative size of the latter parameters through the re - entrant region is in agreement with experiment ( kozlov et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "it is of interest to determine if any one effect can be said to drive the transition from the @xmath1 to @xmath0 phase in the neutral system . to this end",
    "we examine the individual terms in the thermodynamic potentials per unit volume @xmath188 of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases as the transition is crossed by increasing the solvent fugacity , @xmath61 , at constant temperature @xmath189 . in table",
    "ii we show the contributions to the free energy per unit volume of the @xmath0 phase and that of the @xmath1 phase coming from the interaction energy , @xmath190 , the lipid tails , @xmath191 , and the solvent @xmath192 all contributions are evaluated at the transition itself , which occurs at @xmath193 , and are measured with respect to the free energy per unit volume of the disordered phase .",
    "we also show the difference in the contribution of each term to the free energies of each phase , and the derivative of this difference with respect to the solvent fugacity .",
    "the difference in the contribution of the entropy of the lipid tails is positive because , with the lipid architecture we have chosen , the large tail volume relative to that of the head favors the hexagonal phase .",
    "the interaction energy favors the lamellar phase , as does the solvent , presumably because the interstices of that phase are two - dimensional , while those of the inverted hexagonal phase are one - dimensional .",
    "the difference between the lipid entropy contributions decreases with increasing solvent concentration because the packing constraints in the @xmath1 phase become more severe as the size of the cores increases ( gruner , 1989 ) .",
    "however it is apparent that neither this term , nor either of the others , changes so rapidly with solvent concentration compared to the others that any particular effect can be said to `` drive '' this transition .",
    "we now turn on the negative charge of the headgroups by varying the chemical potential of the free counter ions while enforcing charge neutrality . increasing the density of free , positive , counter ions in our closed system is equivalent to increasing the magnitude of the negative charge density on the headgroups .",
    "it therefore corresponds to an increase in the ph of an experimental system .",
    "the charge on the headgroups is annealed , meaning that it is determined by the local value of the electrostatic potential , and therefore the headgroup charge varies with the location of that group .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 , defined in eq .",
    "[ betastar ] , measures the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "it can be written as the ratio of two lengths , @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the bjerrum length , and @xmath196 is a length characterizing the architecture of the lipid .",
    "it is reasonable that @xmath58 be larger than or of order unity , and we have arbitrarily taken @xmath197    we find for this system that the effect of increasing headgroup charge is to decrease the temperature of all transitions . as an example , we show in fig .",
    "6 the way the temperature , @xmath147 , of the transition between @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases varies with the magnitude of the average charge density of the headgroups @xmath198 .",
    "the range of charge density corresponds to the headgroups varying from being neutral to fully charged .",
    "the region beyond the almost vertical line at @xmath199 would correspond to the headgroups being charged with a probability greater than unity , and is therefore unphysical .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath200 is slightly different in the two phases . over the physical range",
    ", one sees a 10 % decrease in the transition temperature , and therefore , a stabilization of the @xmath1 phase with respect to the @xmath0 phase .",
    "although at first surprising , this is a reasonable result , and can be understood as follows . in the neutral system , the single interaction parameter in the system , @xmath57 , is a measure of the tendency for the system to order , and is proportional to the inverse temperature .",
    "when the charges are turned on , the coulomb repulsion between headgroups opposes ordering , and therefore has an effect similar to a decrease in @xmath57 or an increase in temperature .",
    "as we have noted earlier , increasing the temperature causes the lamellar phase to become unstable to the hexagonal phase .",
    "a complimentary view is to note that increasing the coulomb repulsion between headgroups increases the area per headgroup , and thus the area between headgroups , an effect which , again , is equivalent to increasing the temperature ( seddon and templer .",
    "the increase in area permits the tails to splay further out , favoring the formation of the inverted hexagonal phase .",
    "the very same result of increasing the density of charges in a system is seen in the lyotropic phases of polyelectrolytes .",
    "there one finds that the phase diagram depends only on the ratio of @xmath57 to the charge on the polymer , at least in the absence of fluctuations ( nyrkova et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "hence an increase in the charge is equivalent to a decrease in @xmath57 or an increase in temperature , leading to an instability of the lamellar phase .",
    "we are confident , therefore , that the transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 phases with increasing charge on the headgroups is the correct result of the model .",
    "however it is completely opposite to the experimental results on phosphatidylserine in water ( hope and cullis , 1980 , bezrukov et al . , 1999 ) . hence there must be a crucial physical mechanism which is not included in the model which includes coulomb interactions only between objects with a net charge .",
    "one such mechanism is the short - ranged attraction between the charges of the headgroup and the dipoles of the neutral water molecules which will cause the latter to aggregate around the former .",
    "furthermore the counterions attracted to the head group will now also be associated with waters of hydration endowing them with a non - negligible volume .",
    "the additional volume of all these waters will increase the effective volume of the headgroup , and therefore tend to stabilize the lamellar phase .",
    "this additional volume will increase with the charge of the headgroup , and could be sufficient to counteract the coulomb repulsion tending to stabilize the hexagonal phase .",
    "this competition is investigated next .",
    "we now include in the system an attractive contact interaction between charges and the neutral solvent .",
    "this models the short - ranged , thermally averaged , interaction between charges and the water dipole , one which varies with separation @xmath201 as @xmath202 , with @xmath41 the dipole moment of water and @xmath95 the bjerrum length .",
    "the above expression is valid for distances such that @xmath203 for water , @xmath204  , and @xmath205 . to approximate this short - ranged interaction by a contact interaction of dimensionless strength @xmath59",
    "is equivalent to employing @xmath206 evaluated at some fixed distance .",
    "any reasonable choice shows that @xmath59 is small .",
    "we have arbitrarily chosen @xmath207 , which corresponds to @xmath208 evaluated at @xmath209 , a distance within the regime in which the approximate expression for the charge - dipole interaction is valid .",
    "the results for the system with the coulomb interaction of strength @xmath210 and which includes the interaction between charges and solvent of strength @xmath207 are qualitatively different from those of the charged lipids without this interaction .",
    "the temperatures of all transitions between ordered phases now increase with increasing headgroup charge , whereas previously they decreased .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "7 is the temperature of the transition between @xmath1 and @xmath0 phases as a function of the magnitude of the average charge density on the headgroups .",
    "one sees that with increasing headgroup charge , the inverted hexagonal phase becomes unstable with respect to the lamellar phase , just as in the experiments on phosphatidylserine in water ( hope and cullis , 1980 , bezrukov et al . , 1999 )    in fig .",
    "8a we show the volume fraction profiles in the @xmath0 phase at a value of @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and temperature @xmath156 at which the @xmath213 transition occurs .",
    "the position through the system is divided by the lattice parameter of the phase which , in units of the radius of gyration of the lipid , is @xmath214 all looks reasonable . in particular ,",
    "the volume fraction of solvent within the bilayer is negligible .",
    "this is true also when the lipid is neutral . in fig .",
    "8b , the charge density profile of the same structure is shown .",
    "one sees that the charge on the headgroup mimics , but does not reproduce , the headgroup volume fraction .",
    "this is because the charge on the headgroup is not fixed , but varies with the local electrostatic potential .",
    "the counter ion density is fairly uniform because we have employed a single dielectric constant , that of water , throughout the system .",
    "were we to require that the dielectric constant be position - dependent , and to take the much lower value in the tail region appropriate to it , the counter ion density there would be much reduced . in figs . 9a and 9b we show the same quantities for the @xmath1 phase at the same value of @xmath62",
    "the cut through the system is taken along the nearest - neighbor direction , and the distance is normalized to its lattice parameter @xmath215 again the wavelength of the @xmath1 phase is smaller than that of the @xmath0 phase because , in two - phase coexistence , _",
    "i.e. _ in the absence of a reservoir of excess water , the cores of the cylinders are not swollen with water and the hexagonal phase contains a smaller volume fraction of water than does the lamellar phase .",
    "one can infer from fig .",
    "9a that in the nearest neighbor direction , there is far more interdigitation of lipid tails than in the lamellar phase .",
    "this makes sense , as the tails must certainly stretch to fill the space between cores in the second - neighbor direction , so that interdigitation is expected in the nearest - neighbor direction .    to investigate this transition further ,",
    "we show in table iii the contributions in the @xmath0 phase and in the @xmath1 phase of the various terms in the thermodynamic potential per unit volume @xmath216 . here",
    "@xmath217 is the hydrophilic - hydrophobic interaction proportional to @xmath218 , @xmath219 is the electrostatic interaction proportional to @xmath58 , and @xmath220 is the charge - solvent interaction proportional to @xmath59 . these contributions are evaluated at the transition itself , and are measured from the free energy per unit volume of the disordered phase .",
    "we also show the difference between these contributions to each phase , and the derivatives of each of these differences with respect to the counter ion fugacity , @xmath62 .",
    "there are several interesting things to note .",
    "the electrostatic energy is a relatively small contribution to the free energy of each phase , and hardly differs between them .",
    "therefore it does not have a large effect in bringing about the transition .",
    "the contribution of the counter ions to the free energy of each phase is of the same order of magnitude as the electrostatic interaction and , like it , does not change rapidly with the counter ion fugacity .",
    "the contribution of the short - range charge - solvent interaction is small , but it changes most rapidly with the counter ion fugacity , and therefore appears to be most important in actually bringing about the transition itself .",
    "the physical mechanism in the experimental systems appears now to be clear .",
    "the lipid with an almost neutral headgroup forms the @xmath1 phase because the volume of the headgroup is relatively small compared to that of the entire lipid .",
    "as the charge on the headgroup is turned on , it attracts an increasing volume of waters of hydration via the attractive interaction between the charge and the dipoles of water .",
    "in addition , more counter ions , enlarged by their own waters of hydration , are attracted to the headgroup .",
    "thus the headgroup becomes effectively larger , and drives the transition to the @xmath0 phase . in doing so",
    ", it overcomes the effect of the coulomb repulsion between headgroups which , in fact , opposes the transition to the @xmath0 phase .",
    "we have argued earlier that an increase in coulomb repulsion was similar to an increase in temperature , and therefore its effect in favoring the @xmath1 phase could be understood from the phase diagram of fig .",
    "1 . in a similar way ,",
    "an increase in the strength of the charge - solvent interaction increases the volume fraction of the headgroup , so that one moves to the right in fig . 1 and stabilizes the lamellar phase",
    ". the combined effect of increasing the headgroup charge is to increase the effective volume fraction of the headgroup and effective temperature .",
    "the phase which is ultimately stabilized results from the competition of these two effects . by changing the strength of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "we have verified that one can alter the effect of this competition , and not only stabilize the inverted hexagonal phase , but also bring about the inverted b.c.c .",
    "phase or even the disordered phase , scenarios which are again understandable from our discussion and the phase diagram of fig",
    ". 1 . but that the result of this competition can be the stabilization of the lamellar phase at the expense of the inverted hexagonal phase has been demonstrated by our model calculation , as well as by experiment .",

    "<S> short - ranged interactions between hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties are included as are the coulomb interactions between charges . </S>",
    "<S> further , we include a short - ranged interaction between charges and neutral solvent , which mimics the short - ranged , thermally averaged interaction between charges and water dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the model of the uncharged lipid displays the usual lyotropic phases as a function of the relative volume fraction of the headgroup . choosing model parameters appropriate to dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine in water , we obtain phase behavior which agrees well with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> finally we choose a solvent concentration and temperature at which the uncharged lipid exhibits an inverted hexagonal phase and turn on the headgroup charge . </S>",
    "<S> the lipid system makes a transition from the inverted hexagonal to the lamellar phase which is related to the increased waters of hydration correlated with the increased headgroup charge via the charge - solvent interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the polymorphism displayed upon variation of ph mimics that of the behavior of phosphatidylserine . </S>"
