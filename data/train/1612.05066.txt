    "gauge / gravity duality conjecture states an equivalence between a theory of quantum gravity in @xmath16-dimensional spacetime and a quantum field theory ( qft ) on the @xmath17-dimensional boundary of the spacetime  @xcite . in its original context",
    "@xcite , the duality was conjectured for string / m theory on ads@xmath18 , with a compact internal manifold @xmath19 , and conformal field theory ( cft ) living on @xmath17-dimensional boundary of the ads space .",
    "having the application to realistic theories like qcd in mind , the extension of the conjecture to non - conformal field theories was pursued soon after  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the conjecture was extended to qfts that are obtained from the cfts either by adding relevant operators to the action or considering vacua where the conformal symmetries are broken spontaneously .",
    "a @xmath17-dimensional qft , which is obtained as a result of either of those deformations , is dual to a string / m theory on a spacetime geometry which is asymptotically ads@xmath18 .",
    "however , there is no complete formulation of string / m theory on a curved background .",
    "hence , the duality is mainly tested in the limit of a weakly curved classical gravity , which corresponds to taking the limits of large @xmath5 as well as large t hooft coupling constant @xmath20 , @xmath5 being the rank of the gauge group .",
    "one of the tests of gauge / gravity duality involves the calculation of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of gauge invariant operators in the large @xmath5 and @xmath20 limits . on the field theory side ,",
    "the calculation follows the usual perturbation expansion where the divergences in the bare quantities are subtracted using the standard renormalization procedure .",
    "when those gauge invariant operators are chiral primary operators ( cpos ) in highly supersymmetric gauge theories , the vevs are protected from quantum corrections by the supersymmetry and they are determined in the classical limit .",
    "the corresponding procedure on the gravity side goes as follows .",
    "given a supergravity solution which is asymptotically ads@xmath18 , it is expanded in terms of harmonic functions on the compact manifold .",
    "the compactification results in towers of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes in @xmath16-dimensional gravity theory .",
    "the gauge / gravity correspondence dictates that for every gauge invariant operator on the field theory side there is a corresponding gravity field among these kk modes .",
    "the vev of the gauge invariant operator is then determined by applying the holographic renormalization procedure  @xcite to those kk modes in the @xmath16-dimensional gravity theory  @xcite . for a cpo of conformal dimension @xmath21 , the vev which is obtained using this procedure is proportional to the coefficient of @xmath22 in the asymptotic expansion of the dual scalar field , @xmath23 being the holographic coordinate of the ads space .",
    "this procedure was implemented to determine the vevs of cpos in the coulomb branch of the @xmath24 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory and the dual type iib string theory on a spacetime geometry which is asymptotically ads@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , testing the gauge / gravity duality at finite @xmath5 and @xmath20 is non - trivial . in @xcite , we reported a summary of our work which shows an exact gauge / gravity duality relation for all values of @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "our analysis is based on the 3-dimensional mass - deformed aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena theory ( mabjm ) of massive m2-branes , which has @xmath26 supersymmetry and @xmath27 gauge symmetry , where @xmath28 is the chern - simons level  @xcite .",
    "the mass - deformed theory is obtained from the original abjm theory  @xcite by adding a relevant deformation which preserves the full supersymmetry as well as the gauge symmetry while the conformal symmetry is completely broken and the su@xmath29 global symmetry is reduced to su@xmath30su@xmath31u@xmath32 .",
    "the mabjm theory supports sets of discrete higgs vacua , which are expressed in terms of the grvv matrices with numerical valued matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the vevs of cpos at finite @xmath5 and @xmath20 is possible due to the existence of these discrete vacua .",
    "since the mabjm theory is obtained from the deformation of a cft by relevant operators , the spacetime geometry of the dual gravity theory should be asymptotically ads@xmath33 .",
    "it was predicted that for the gauge theory describing massive m2-branes , the dual gravity theory is m - theory on the 11-dimensional lin - lunin - maldacena ( llm ) geometry  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the llm geometry with @xmath3 orbifold and so(2,1)@xmath4so(4)/@xmath34so(4)/@xmath3 isometry is asymptotically ads@xmath35 . in line with this prediction a",
    "one - to - one correspondence between the vacua of the mabjm theory and the llm geometry was obtained  @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for related works .    in this paper , we quantitatively test the above gauge / gravity duality in terms of the vevs of cpos at finite @xmath5 and @xmath20 . on the field theory side , some of the classical vacuum solutions are protected from quantum corrections due to the high number of supersymmetry .",
    "the vevs of cpos are determined by those supersymmetric vacua .",
    "we calculate the vevs of the cpo with conformal dimension @xmath36 for all possible supersymmetric vacua of the mabjm theory for finite @xmath5 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath28 . on the gravity theory side , we start with equations of motion on ads@xmath38 background in 11-dimensional supergravity . in order to obtain the 4-dimensional equations of motion , we implement the kk reduction procedure on @xmath39 .",
    "the llm solutions were obtained in some unknown gauge . in order to solve the 4-dimensional equations using the llm solutions",
    ", we need to write the equations with gauge invariant combinations for kk modes background in de donder gauge , see @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , recovering the equations of motion of gauge invariant fields from those of the fields in the de donder gauge is not straightforward . ] . in general",
    ", the kk reduction leads to cubic or higher order interaction terms among the kk modes , which results in non - linear equations of motion .",
    "when we are interested only in the cpo with conformal dimension @xmath36 , the linearized equations are sufficient . however , for cpos with @xmath40 , one has to consider non - linear equations@xcite , where some non - trivial field redefinitions are required to relate 4-dimensional and 11-dimensional fields .",
    "see @xcite for non - linear results on the ads@xmath41 background . here",
    "we focus on the @xmath36 case .",
    "according to the gauge / gravity dictionary  @xcite , we read the vevs from the asymptotic expansions of the kk scalar modes . as a result",
    ", we obtain an exact holographic relation which is given by @xmath42 where we consider @xmath43 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a function of the conformal dimensions and also depends on some parameters of the llm solutions , but does not depend on @xmath5 . for a given @xmath5",
    "the number of supersymmetric vacua is equal to the partition of @xmath5 and the above result is valid for all supersymmetric vacua  @xcite .",
    "we also extend this result to @xmath44 , however , for some specific types of the llm solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mabjmllm ] ,",
    "we summarize the one - to - one correspondence between the discrete supersymmetric vacua of the mabjm theory and the llm solutions with @xmath3 orbifold . in section [ vcpo - mabjm ] ,",
    "we discuss cpos in the abjm theory and obtain the vevs of the operators in the case @xmath36 . in section [ kkr - giv ] , we apply the kk reduction to 11-dimensional supergravity equations of motion and obtain linearized equations for 4-dimensional gauge invariant kk modes . in section [ kkh - llm ] ,",
    "we use the method of holographic renormalization to read the vevs of cpo with @xmath36 from the asymptotic expansion of the llm solutions and compare the field theory and the gravity results . in section [ conc ] ,",
    "we draw some conclusions and discuss some future directions as well .",
    "we also include three appendixes where we discuss some general features of spherical harmonics on @xmath39 , give some details about asymptotic expansions of the llm solutions as well as the proof of equation .",
    "the @xmath0 abjm theory with @xmath45 gauge group is a superconformal cs matter theory with cs level @xmath28 and it describes the low energy dynamics of @xmath5 coincident m2-branes on the @xmath46 orbifold fixed point  @xcite",
    ". one interesting feature of the abjm theory is that it allows supersymmetry preserving mass deformation  @xcite .",
    "that is , the resulting mass - deformed theory called the mabjm theory has still @xmath26 supersymmetry though the conformal symmetry of the original theory is broken under the deformation .",
    "this deformation is achieved by adding some terms to the lagrangian of the abjm theory , which break the global su(4 ) symmetry to @xmath47 . solving the classical vacuum equation of the mabjm theory ,",
    "it was shown that the classical vacuum solutions are discrete and represented by the grvv matrices  @xcite .",
    "some vacuum solutions for given @xmath5 and @xmath28 are protected from quantum corrections and have one - to - one correspondence with the llm geometries with @xmath3  @xcite quotient in 11-dimensional supergravity . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the correspondence .      to reflect the global symmetry of the mabjm theory we split the 4-complex scalar fields as follows @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then the vacuum equation of the mabjm theory , @xmath51 , is written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a mass parameter .",
    "the general solutions of the matrix equations in have been found in the form of the grvv matrices  @xcite . for given @xmath5 and @xmath28",
    ", there are many possible solutions satisfying the equations in .",
    "a systematic way to classify the vacuum solutions is to represent those as direct sums of two types of irreducible @xmath54 matrices , @xmath55 and their hermitian conjugates , @xmath56 .",
    "these rectangular matrices are the grvv matrices @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the numbers of empty columns and rows , respectively .",
    "since @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath68 matrices , the occupation numbers , @xmath61 and @xmath63 , should satisfy the following two constraints , @xmath69 ,   \\qquad    \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}n_n =   \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}n_n ' . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at quantum level , only a subset of these classical solutions , which satisfy the conditions , @xmath70 remains to be supersymmetric  @xcite .",
    "the llm solution with so(2,1)@xmath4so(4)@xmath4so(4 ) isometry in 11-dimensional supergravity is conjectured to be dual to the theory of massive m2-branes  @xcite . later",
    ", the mabjm theory with cs level @xmath9 is proposed to be the theory of massive m2-branes . for the mabjm theory with general @xmath28",
    ", one has to consider the @xmath71 orbifold of the llm geometry as the dual gravity theory  @xcite .",
    "we note that the function @xmath89 at @xmath92 has a value @xmath93 if @xmath94 and it has a value @xmath95 if @xmath96 .",
    "based on this fact , the llm geometries are represented in terms of an infinite strip in the @xmath97-direction with regions of @xmath98 denoted by black color and regions of @xmath99 denoted by white color .",
    "this is called the droplet representation .",
    "see the fig.1 .",
    "since the function @xmath100 is @xmath101 if @xmath102 and it is @xmath93 if @xmath103 , @xmath80 being the number of finite black regions , we note that the strip also contains an infinite black region below @xmath104 and an infinite white region above @xmath105 .    for every droplet picture",
    "there is a symmetric point such that the length of all finite size black regions above this point is the same as the length of all finite size white regions below the point .",
    "this point is called the fermi level @xmath106 , which is given by @xmath107 the strip is divided into excitation levels above and below the fermi level , where each level has length @xmath28 .",
    "the levels are labeled by non - negative integers @xmath108 starting at the fermi level .",
    "a given droplet representation is then parametrized by a set of parameters @xmath109 with @xmath110 corresponding to the length of the black region in the @xmath111-th level above the fermi level and @xmath112 corresponding to the length of the white region in the @xmath111-th level below the fermi level . since the length of the black or white region in a given level can not be bigger than @xmath28 these parameters should satisfy the condition @xmath113 , which is the same as .",
    "actually , it have been suggested that there is one - to - one correspondence between the llm solutions and the vacua of mabjm theory  @xcite .",
    "since , the llm solutions are classified by @xmath114 , while the field theory vacua are classified by the occupation numbers @xmath115 , the one - to - one correspondence is given by @xmath116    an alternative representation of the llm solutions is given in terms of young diagrams . in young diagram representation , the lengths of the white and black regions correspond to the lengths of the horizontal and vertical edges of the young diagram , respectively .",
    "see fig.1 for the parametrization of droplet picture and young diagram .",
    "for the coulomb branch of the @xmath24 sym theory , the adjoint scalar fields @xmath117 s satisfy the vacuum equation @xmath118 = 0 $ ] , which means the matrix representations of the scalar fields describing the vacuum moduli are diagonal . as a result , the u(@xmath5 ) gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath119 .",
    "the vacuum moduli preserve the @xmath12 supersymmetry while the conformal symmetry is completely broken .",
    "the vevs of cpos are non - renormalizable due to high supersymmetry and they can parametrize the coulomb branch vacua . on the other hand , in the type iib supergravity ,",
    "some bps solutions describing d3-branes distributed over finite region of the transverse space were obtained  @xcite .",
    "these solutions are asymptotic to ads@xmath41 . according to the gauge / gravity dictionary",
    ", the vevs of cpos is read from the asymptotic expansion of the dual scalar fields . calculating the vevs of cpos with lower conformal dimensions ,",
    "the exact dual relations for the coulomb branch of the @xmath120 sym theory in the large @xmath5 limit were tested in a systematic way  @xcite .",
    "now we compare the mabjm theory and the coulomb branch of the sym theory .",
    "there are some differences between these two theories .",
    "for instance , the mabjm theory is constructed by adding some relevant terms to lagrangian of the abjm theory and have discrete higgs vacua with matrix representations composed of numerical elements , while for the coulomb branch of the @xmath120 sym theory , the lagrangian is undeformed , instead it is defined by choosing some non - vanishing vacuum moduli , which are composed of continuous parameters .",
    "however , these two theories are similar in the sense that the theories are away from the uv fixed point and they preserve the full supersymmetry with the dual geometries asymptotic to ads times a compact manifold . based on these facts and the known results of the coulomb branch of the @xmath120 sym theory , one can expect that similar phenomena may happen for the higgs vacua in the mabjm theory .",
    "that is , the higgs vacua of the mabjm theory are parametrized by vevs of cpos and those vevs are read from asymptotic expansions of the llm geometries using the holographic renormalization procedure .    in this section ,",
    "we construct the cpo with @xmath6 , which manifests the global symmetry of the mabjm theory .",
    "we also calculate the vevs of the oprator for all supersymmetric vacua of mabjm theory with finite @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "the gauge invariant cpos of conformal dimension @xmath21 in the abjm theory are given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are symmetric in lower as well as upper indices and traceless when tracing over one lower index and one upper index .",
    "the cpo in is written by manifesting the global su(4 ) symmetry of the abjm theory .",
    "on the other hand , in the mabjm theory the cpos have to manifest the su(2)@xmath4su(2)@xmath4u(1 ) global symmetry .",
    "it is well known fact that the coefficients @xmath123 are identified with the similar coefficients @xmath124 , which defines the scalar spherical harmonics on @xmath39 ( see appendix [ shs7 ] )  @xcite .",
    "these coefficients also satisfy the same orthonormality condition as those of the spherical harmonics ; @xmath125 therefore , one can fix these coefficients knowing the corresponding coefficients of the spherical harmonics on @xmath39 . in appendix",
    "[ scalar - harm ] , we list the first few scalar spherical harmonics on @xmath39 , which are needed to read the coefficients for cpos with lower conformal dimensions .",
    "in particular , the coefficients of the cpo with @xmath36 are determined in appendix [ cabd1 ] and the operator is given by @xmath126      here we calculate the vevs of cpo with @xmath36 in mabjm theory . as we see in , the cpo we are considering is composed of the complex scalar fields @xmath127 s and their complex conjugates . for a given supersymmetric vacuum ,",
    "the scalar fields near the vacuum are expanded as @xmath128 where @xmath129 s ( @xmath49 ) denote the vacuum solutions represented by the grvv matrices  @xcite , and @xmath130 s are field operators . inserting into of a cpo with conformal dimension @xmath21",
    ", we obtain @xmath131 where @xmath132 denotes the vev of an operator in the abjm theory , and @xmath133 is an operator containing at least one @xmath130 or @xmath134 . in the second equality of , we used the fact that the one - point function of an operator without background in a cft is vanishing .    for cpo with @xmath36 the vevs",
    "are obtained by plugging the vacuum solutions in into . since @xmath135 is a block diagonal matrix , which contains @xmath61 of the rectangular matrix @xmath62 , while @xmath136 contains @xmath137 of the matrix @xmath56 , we have @xmath138 where in the last step we have used the rectangular matrices in .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath139 this result is valid for all supersymmetric vacua of mabjm theory with finite @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "the kk reduction of 11-dimensional gravity to 4 dimensions involves compactification of the fields on @xmath39 .. here we consider @xmath9 case , for simplicity .",
    "we will extend our results to general @xmath28 case eventually . ] in this section we apply the kk reduction to the 11-dimensional gravity on ads@xmath38 to obtain 4-dimensional equation of motion on ads@xmath140 background .",
    "such kk reduction was carried out in the de donder gauge in @xcite .",
    "however , the llm solutions of our interest in this paper are in a different gauge and can not be analyzed based on the results obtained in the de donder gauge .",
