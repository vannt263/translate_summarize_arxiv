    "<S> the large surface density changes associated with the ( 100 ) noble metals surface hex - reconstruction suggest the use of non - particle conserving simulation methods . </S>",
    "<S> we present an example of a surface grand canonical monte carlo applied to the transformation of a square non reconstructed surface to the hexagonally covered low temperature stable au(100 ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> classical molecular dynamics allows to investigate microscopic details of the reconstruction dynamics , and we show , as an example , retraction of a step and its interplay with the surface reconstruction / deconstruction mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the ( 100 ) surface of noble metals ( au , pt , ir ) shows a quasi - hexagonal reconstruction , which has been deeply investigated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction is characterized by an approximate ( in au and pt , where a slight incommensurability is observed ) or exact ( in ir ) @xmath0 unit cell , arising from the interplay of a slightly contracted and distorted triangular surface layer with the ( square ) second layer . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be interpreted in terms of a simple model ( the _ glue model _ ) incorporating the tendency of surface atoms to increase their coordinations @xcite . as the result of a strong packing tendency , </S>",
    "<S> the density of the top layer at low temperature is about 24% larger than that of a regular ( 100 ) layer , and it tends to increase with temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the angular orientation of the top layer undergoes phase transitions well characterised by x - ray measurements @xcite .    at a temperature of @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> a deconstruction transition occurs , and the long - range hexagonal order parameter vanishes . a surprisingly exact coincidence of ( rescaled ) transition temperatures for the three noble metals is observed . in spite of this large amount of theoretical and experimental work , a detailed insight into the consequences of the strong density difference between a square </S>",
    "<S> , unreconstructed @xmath2 layer and the reconstructed triangular surface is still lacking , particularly concerning the interplay between defects such as steps , and the reconstruction / deconstruction mechanism . to this </S>",
    "<S> end , molecular dynamics ( md ) is a valid tool , especially for noble metals such as gold , where glue potentials have revealed to be predictive . </S>",
    "<S> classical md makes it possible to simulate a large number of atoms for a time scale of several nanoseconds , allowing for instance to follow the movement of a step on a surface . on the other side , </S>",
    "<S> a deep theoretical understanding of the deconstruction transition at high temperatures has not been achieved until now , and md simulations have a difficulty in reproducing this aspect due to the atom number conservation constraint : strong density changes at the surface are involved , and crater / islands appear as a consequence of these changes and of the impossibility to create / delete atoms as needed </S>",
    "<S> . a more natural method in this case should be grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have successfully applied this method to the preroughening of rare gas crystal surfaces @xcite and to rare gas adsorption on an attractive substrate @xcite . in the case of metals </S>",
    "<S> the low vapor pressure and equilibration problems hinder in some way the success of the method . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results are however encouraging .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we present two examples of simulation on the au(100 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a calculation which reveals the possibilities of gcmc even in the case of metals : starting from a square surface , the system spontaneously formed a hexagonally reconstructed overlayer ; the second example is a high - t md simulation of a step on this surface , and its interplay with the reconstruction . in both studies </S>",
    "<S> we have adopted a slab geometry with periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath3 directions . </S>",
    "<S> the potential we used is the _ glue _ potential @xcite which consists of a two - body term and of a density dependent term , mimicking the valence electrons effects in metals .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we will report on our gcmc study . </S>",
    "<S> our monte carlo procedure involves small displacement moves ( m ) , creations ( c ) , and destructions ( d ) with relative probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> small moves apply to all particles , whereas creation / destruction is restricted to a fixed surface region , about four layers wide . </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated two different systems at low temperature : a non - reconstructed surface ( a ) and a reconstructed quasi - hexagonal surface ( b ) in both cases the slab had 225 atoms per layer , and was 16 layer thick . </S>",
    "<S> we found the following results :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> upon adsorption of atoms on the square top layer [ system ( a ) ] , the adatoms are included and the equilibrium state of the surface is , correctly , the @xmath7 reconstructed quasi - hexagonal state ; 2 .   upon adsorption of atoms on the reconstructed layer [ system ( b ) ] , another reconstructed layer forms , and the former first layer , now covered , deconstructs immediately into a nearly regular , square @xmath2 layer .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface density @xmath8 for system ( a ) continuously changes from the bulk value to the hexagonal value . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential is @xmath9 and the averaged density @xmath10 levels up at a nearly correct value of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> all simulations are performed at @xmath12 figure 1 shows the initial unreconstructed state ( a ) , two intermediate states with hexagonal zones which begin to form , and the equilibrium final state , triangularly ordered .    for system ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the number of atoms of the ad - layer and the population of the first two adsorbed layers is shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the density of the first layer decreases nearly to the bulk value when the ad - layer has completed its growth , and completes its square ordering when another adlayer has adsorbed on it .    </S>",
    "<S> these results show that the gcmc simulation method is efficient also on the microscopic scale : structural phase transitions involving strong density changes and rearrangement of atoms are correctly driven by the grand canonical markovian chain we used in order to sample this particular statistical ensemble . not only the correct density is achieved , but also an almost perfect short - range order is obtained both in the reconstructed top layer and in the square bulk layers . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is remarkable , if one takes into account the fact that an off - lattice model was used and no constraints on the lattice structure were given .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now present the other study concerning molecular dynamics simulation of a step on a flat au(100 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> we adopted the same glue potential as before in the slab geometry ( 16 layer slab , with a maximum of 2500 atoms per layer ) , numerically integrating newton s equations for simulation times of the order of nanoseconds .    upon increase of temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the lateral density of a flat reconstructed au(100 ) surface shows a tendency to increase ( enhancement of lateral coordination is compensated by an anomalous outwards relaxation of the first layer ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find in our simulations @xcite an increase of the t @xmath13 lateral density of 1.24 with respect to the bulk , to 1.35 for t @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in close agreement with experiment for both au and pt @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when a step is added to the flat surface , it becomes a free source of atoms for a layer which needs to increase its density . </S>",
    "<S> heating can therefore trigger step retraction on a hex - reconstructed surface . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the mechanism of this retraction in au(100 ) in a ` one step geometry ' . </S>",
    "<S> usual periodic boundary condition in the @xmath3 plane of the slab are not suitable to simulate a surface with a single step : only an even number of steps allows matching at the boundaries , due to the @xmath15 stacking of @xmath2 layers in a fcc crystal . in order to allow modelling a single step </S>",
    "<S> , we have adopted special boundary conditions : if an atom of a layer @xmath16 crosses the slab boundary which is parallel to the step , it appears on the other side displaced vertically by one layer , with the proper horizontal mismatch between layer @xmath16 and layer @xmath17 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , a single step separates an @xmath16 terrace from a @xmath17 terrace .    </S>",
    "<S> when the step retracts , it uncovers by doing so a portion of terrace which in turn must also become reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> this must occur most naturally by incorporation into the lower terrace of atoms formerly belonging to the upper retracting terrace , whose retraction must in turn be accelerated by this loss . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , when a step advances , it covers a portion of terrace which must at the same time deconstruct . </S>",
    "<S> this must liberate excess atoms , which must in their turn be incorporated in the advancing upper terrace , causing it to advance even more . while this `` positive feedback '' is obvious , the mechanisms of its actual occurrence have not been described before , and their consequences seem worth studying in some detail . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of our simulations was an equilibrated step at t=@xmath18 ( figure 3 ) then suddenly brought to a higher temperature of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium lateral density of the upper surface suddenly jumps upwards by 5% , whence the step begins to retract . </S>",
    "<S> we show in figure 4 some stages of the simulation . to clarify the process we have marked in yellow the top layer atoms , labelled the atoms which participate in the process , marked with a number the initially top - layer atoms , and with a letter the atoms initially belonging to the second layer . </S>",
    "<S> after 70 ps ( figure 5 ) , retraction has occurred and the uncovered zone has become reconstructed : atoms which were formerly on the step edge ( atoms 1 - 7 and 11 - 15 ) , have been incorporated into the lower terrace and form with the atoms of the formerly quadratic substrate a hexagonal pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the positive feedback which we had anticipated does exist , and appears also to play a dynamical role in rendering the retracting step particularly wiggly .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented two examples of simulation on the au@xmath2 surface . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the gcmc exemplification , we must give , of course , credit to the glue potential we have used @xcite , but we are confident that the interplay between efficient phenomenological potentials and particle - non - conserving algorithms such as the one just described will lead to interesting predictions in the field of structural transitions at surfaces , in particular because no assumptions on the final structure need to be made in advance . summarizing , this simple test indicates the feasibility of a surface gcmc simulation , applied in particular to metals modeled by classical many - body ( glue ) forces .    </S>",
    "<S> the single step simulation shows an example of non - standard periodic boundary conditions , and the power of classical md for the investigation of microscopic details of physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> single atoms can be ` followed ' during the simulation ; in this case , an interesting interplay between step movement , density change and reconstruction has been exploited .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank francesco di tolla for discussions . </S>",
