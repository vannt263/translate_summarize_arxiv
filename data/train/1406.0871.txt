    "the high energy emission from many accretion - powered x - ray binaries is characterized by strong variability on timescales extending from milliseconds to weeks or longer . the softest x - ray emission ( including a very soft thermal component )",
    "is observed during phases of rapid accretion , and a hard x - ray component ( along with associated strong radio emission ) is observed during periods of relatively slow accretion .",
    "the quiescent spectrum in the hard state is characterized by a power - law x - ray continuum , which is most likely due to the thermal comptonization of soft x - rays in a hot ( @xmath0k ) corona ( e.g. , shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) .",
    "the x - ray variability observed on millisecond timescales allows us to glimpse the inner workings of the accretion disk , but at these short timescales , the signal - to - noise ratio is too low to study the variability using snapshots of the spectrum . a useful alternative is provided by the study of x - ray time lags , which are computed by combining the fourier transformed data streams in two energy channels .",
    "fourier - based analysis is extremely efficient because all of the data in the observational time window is utilized , significantly reducing the uncertainty in the derived parameters .",
    "the physical origin of the observed x - ray time lags is not yet completely understood .",
    "the time lags may be the result of the upscattering of soft seed photons by hot electrons , known as `` compton reverberation '' ( payne 1980 ) , which naturally produces hard time lags because the higher - energy photons spend more time upscattering in the plasma before escaping .",
    "this concept was explored by van der klis et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , who concluded that the observed decrease in the time lag with increasing fourier frequency in sources such as cyg x-1 was inconsistent with the comptonization model .",
    "however , the idea was reexamined later by nowak et al .",
    "( 1999a ) and hua , kazanas , & cui ( 1999 , hereafter hkc ) , who used more sophisticated simulations that produced better agreement with the data , but the size of the scattering cloud and the implied energy budget remained problematic .    in this letter , we reconsider the possible role of thermal comptonization in the formation of the x - ray time lags observed from black hole candidates .",
    "we develop a rigorous method for the computation of x - ray time lags based on the exact solution for the fourier transform of the green s function describing the radiation signal emerging from a spherical compton scattering corona . by exploiting the linearity of the problem ,",
    "we are able to explore a wide variety of injection scenarios , providing a useful alternative to monte carlo simulations , which are often either unreliable or noisy at high fourier frequencies ( and short timescales ) due to sampling errors .",
    "we confirm that the comptonization of monochromatic seed photons injected into a homogeneous scattering cloud is unable to account for the observed dependence of the x - ray time lags on the fourier frequency .",
    "however , we find that the reprocessing of _ broadband _ ( bremsstrahlung ) injection reproduces the observed frequency dependence within the constraints of an acceptable cloud size and energy budget .",
    "in the complex cross - spectrum ( ccs ) method first introduced by van der klis et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , intensity variations in two energy channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 are used to extract phase shifts and associated time lags .",
    "the ccs method is implemented by fourier transforming the light curves in the hard and soft energy channels , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , to obtain the corresponding fourier transformed light curves @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fourier frequency .",
    "the two transformed light curves are used to construct the complex cross spectrum , defined by @xmath8 , and the resulting time lag is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 gives the phase lag ( nowak et al .",
    "one can easily demonstrate that if @xmath4 and @xmath3 represent the signal levels in the soft and hard channels , respectively , and if a perfect time delay between the two channels is introduced , such that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , then the time lag derived using the ccs method described above is @xmath13 , as expected .",
    "it is important to note that time lags are only created during transients , and are never produced during the steady - state reprocessing of radiation in a scattering cloud with constant properties .",
    "our focus here is on the determination of the effect of electron scattering on the signal measured by a distant observer during a transient in which a sudden flash of seed radiation is injected into a hot corona overlying an accretion disk . in this first exact treatment of the process , we restrict our attention to the case of a spherical , homogeneous , and isothermal cloud .",

    "our model requires a relatively high electron temperature , @xmath121k , at large radii , @xmath122 , in order to explain the observed time lags , in agreement with other compton scattering models ( hkc ; poutanen 2001 ) . this temperature is higher than some disk models predict at that distance , although we note that you et al .",

    "( 2012 ) can provide the required energy at that distance .",
    "the qualitatively different behavior observed in the bremsstrahlung injection scenario stems from the fact that photons with energies inside both energy channel windows already exist in the injected spectrum .",
    "hence , when the injection occurs close to the edge of the cloud , `` prompt '' photons inside the energy channel windows are able to escape immediately .",
    "the prompt escape phase represents the fastest timescale during the transient , and consequently this is the process that contributes to the high - frequency part of the fourier transform .",
    "the resulting time lag diminishes with increasing fourier frequency because the high- and low - energy prompt photons escape at the same rate , with no upscattering required , so there is no relative delay between the two channel energies at the highest fourier frequencies .",
    "conversely , at low frequencies , the process becomes dominated by the longest timescale phenomenon , which is the exponential decay of the photon number density due to photons that remain in the plasma for a long time .",
    "this phase is dominated by the upscattering of very soft bremsstrahlung seed photons , which take longer to upscatter to the higher energy channel .",
    "hence the low - frequency behavior of the bremsstrahlung time lag profile is similar to what is observed in the case of monochromatic injection .",
    "we have developed a rigorous analytical model with very few free parameters that is capable of simultaneously describing the quiescent x - ray spectrum from cyg x-1 , as well as the transient time lags , based on thermal comptonization in a homogeneous corona . in future work",
    ", we plan to extend the analytical model to treat an inhomogeneous corona , with electron density @xmath120 .",
    "the homogeneous case treated here underestimates the time lags at low frequencies , and we expect the inhomogeneous density to result in a better fit across the entire time lag profile since the distribution of scattering times will be more accurately computed ."
