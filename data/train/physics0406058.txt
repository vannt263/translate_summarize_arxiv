    "molecular biology has scored an impressive number of success stories over the last forty years .",
    "it has provided us with a vast knowledge about molecules at work in living systems , about their involvement in specific biological functionalities and about the structure of their chemical networks @xcite . yet",
    "one is still unable to take advantage of this knowledge for constructing a comprehensive description of cell behavior . assuming that we had all desired molecular informations , the computer time required to describe meaningful cell behavior would be totally prohibitive .",
    "meanwhile there is a clear need for a generic description of cells .",
    "an alternative approach consists in identifying a reduced number of key characteristics and construct a phenomenological description of a `` simplified '' but relevant cell .",
    "again this task is currently too complex at the scale of a whole cell , but it can be envisioned for some of its constituents .",
    "a good example is provided by the description of membranes : for length scales of the order of a few tens of nanometers up , it can be considered as a fluctuating surface on which a few densities are distributed and through which a few other densities permeate passively or actively @xcite . the construction of the theory has been going on for more than thirty years .",
    "it sheds light on the physics of membrane shape , topology changes such as budding , equilibrium and non equilibrium fluctuations , membrane adhesion , long range interactions on membranes etc ... it is still under development to include out of equilibrium features such as lipid and protein exchange with the bulk , but much has been learned already .",
    "efforts towards understanding the cytoskeleton are more recent .",
    "they have been focused on the description of its passive visco - elastic properties which are now fairly well understood in terms of gels made of cross - linked semi - flexible polymers @xcite .",
    "such materials which can be prepared in vitro , are equilibrium systems which obey conventional thermodynamics . in eukaryotic cells ,",
    "the problem is however qualitatively new : the cross - links can be made of motor proteins which have their own dynamics driven by chemical energy .",
    "experiments , simulations and analytical descriptions , have shown that such systems have a rich and complex behavior @xcite .",
    "one can grasp the degree of complexity with the remark that cross - links define distances , in other words they define a metric .",
    "the cross - linking agents being motor proteins they move and the metric evolves with time .",
    "in fact the problem is even more complex since cytoskeletal filaments are polar and out of equilibrium : they polymerize at one end while depolymerizing at the other end .",
    "such a process called treadmilling is well known to biologists .",
    "the description of eukaryotic cytoskeletal gels should include all these features .",
    "we call these gels and more generally all gels working in the presence of a permanent energy consumption `` active '' gels . on large length scales and long time scales ,",
    "the properties of complex materials can be captured by a generalized hydrodynamic theory based on conservation laws and symmetry considerations .",
    "such theories have been very successful in describing complex fluids such as liquid crystals , polymers , conventional gels , superfluids etc . @xcite .",
    "for instance all liquid crystal display devices can be described by such theories .",
    "more recently active liquid crystals have been considered within this same logic @xcite . here , we develop a hydrodynamic theory of active gels .",
    "an example of such gel is the network of actin cytoskeletal filaments in the presence of chemical processes which locally induce filament sliding and generate motion .",
    "these active processes are mediated by motor proteins which hydrolyze a fuel , adenosinetriphosphate ( atp ) .",
    "since cytoskeletal filaments are structurally polar , each filament defines a vector .",
    "this filamental structure can on large scales give rise to a polarity of the material if filaments are aligned on average .",
    "we develop the hydrodynamic theory of active polar gels systematically in several steps , following standard procedures .",
    "first , we identify the relevant fields and write conservation laws for conserved quantities .",
    "we identify the generalized fluxes and conjugate forces in the system .",
    "these fluxes and forces define the rates of entropy production and dissipation . using the signature of forces and fluxes with respect to time reversal ,",
    "we define dissipative and reactive fluxes . these fluxes can be expressed by a general expansion in terms of forces , by writing all terms allowed by symmetry and by respecting the signatures with respect to time reversal . by keeping the relevant terms to lowest order , this finally results in generic dynamic equations which are valid in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium .",
    "we then provide examples by analyzing the active gel mode structure and by discussing the spontaneous dynamical behavior of topological singularities such as disclinations ( asters and vortices ) in two dimensions .",
    "eventually we discuss the merits of our approach , its current limitations and ways to extend its domain of validity to the more relevant far from equilibrium regime .",
    "some of the results discussed here have been presented in ref .",
    "we develop the hydrodynamic description of active gels starting with conservation laws .",
    "the number density of monomers in the gel is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "the gel is created by polymerization of filaments from monomers .",
    "the monomers have a density @xmath1 in solution . the treadmilling process and",
    "the active stresses in the gel create a flow of the actin gel monomers with a local velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the gel current is then convective and mass conservation implies that @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the depolymerization rate ; we assume , as seems to be the case for actin , that the depolymerization which occurs mostly at the branching points of the gel , has a rate proportional to the local density . in some cases treated below",
    ", we will consider for simplicity that depolymerization does not occur in the bulk but at the surface of the gel .",
    "in many situations , filament polymerization is highly controlled and localized for example at the surface of the gel .",
    "this is taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ drhodt ] ) by introducing the surface polymerization rate @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes a dirac - like distribution which is non - vanishing only at the gel surface @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , we write a conservation law for free diffusing monomers , @xmath8 here , we have introduced the diffusive current @xmath9 of free monomers .",
    "active processes are mediated by molecular motors .",
    "the concentration of motors bound to the gel @xmath10 is an important quantity to characterize the effects of active processes in the gel .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the total number of motors is conserved , we write conservation laws for @xmath10 and the concentration of freely diffusing motors in the solvent @xmath11 which read @xmath12 the attachment and detachment rates of motors to and from the gel are characterized by the chemical rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here , we have taken into account that bound motors are convected with the gel .",
    "the current of free motors is @xmath15 and we denote @xmath16 the current of bound motors relative to gel motion . in general , binding of motors to the gel is cooperative , and can not be described as a second order reaction : groups of motors could bind together .",
    "we use here an @xmath17 order chemical kinetics where the rates is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "a final important conservation law is momentum conservation . in biological gels on scales of micrometers ,",
    "inertial forces are negligible and momentum conservation is replaced by the force balance condition which reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an external force density . locally , there are two forces acting on the gel , the total stress tensor @xmath21 and the pressure @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is specified if the flow velocity @xmath2 and the currents @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are known .",
    "the physical description of the currents is discussed in the following sections .",
    "furthermore , we have to take into account the polar nature of the gel .",
    "individual filaments are rod - like objects with two different ends which therefore have a vectorial symmetry . if the filaments in the gel are on average aligned , the material is oriented .",
    "we introduce a polarization field @xmath23 to describe this orientation .",
    "the field @xmath24 is defined by associating with each filament a unit vector pointing to one end .",
    "the vector @xmath23 is given by the local average of a large number of these unit vectors .",
    "the fluxes of monomers and motor molecules are generated by forces which act on the active gel and induce motion . in this section",
    ", we identify the relevant forces and derive general flux - force relations .",
    "these relations define the material properties , and characterize how the system reacts to different types of generalized forces . of particular significance for our theory is the existence of active processes mediated by molecular motors . in general , a chemical fuel , such as adenosine - triphosphate ( @xmath25 ) , is used as an energy source .",
    "motor molecules consume @xmath25 by catalyzing the hydrolysis to adenosinediphosphate ( @xmath26 ) and an inorganic phosphate and transduce the free energy of this reaction to generate forces and motion along the filaments .",
    "the energy of @xmath25 is also used for polymerization and depolymerization of the filaments .",
    "the presence of the fuel is equivalent to a chemical `` force '' acting on the system .",
    "we characterize this generalized force by the chemical potential difference @xmath27 of @xmath25 and its hydrolysis products , @xmath26 and phosphate .",
    "when @xmath27 vanishes the chemical reaction is at equilibrium and there is no energy production .",
    "when @xmath28 , a free energy @xmath27 is consumed per hydrolyzed @xmath25 molecule .",
    "constitutive equations are obtained by first identifying the fluxes and the corresponding conjugate generalized forces and then writing a general expansion for the fluxes in terms of the forces .",
    "we study in this paper an active gel close to thermodynamic equilibrium and limit the expansion of fluxes in terms of forces to linear order as in a standard onsager theory .",
    "we thus describe the linear response of the gel to generalized forces .",
    "we do this in the most general way and write in the flux - force expansion all terms which are consistent with the symmetries of the system .",
    "we first discuss the rate of entropy production in the active gel .",
    "a change in the free energy @xmath29 per unit time can be written as @xmath30 where the `` dot '' denotes a time derivative .",
    "the total deviatory stress tensor @xmath21 is in general is not symmetric ; it is conjugate to the velocity gradient @xmath31 .",
    "the field conjugate to the order parameter @xmath32 is the functional derivative of the free energy @xmath33 of the gel at thermal equilibrium , @xmath34 , where the functional derivative is taken for constant deformation , temperature and number of particles .",
    "the current conjugate to the field @xmath35 is the convected time derivative of the polarization @xmath36 .",
    "the chemical force @xmath37 is conjugate to the @xmath25 consumption rate @xmath38 which determines the number of @xmath39 molecules hydrolyzed per unit time and per unit volume .",
    "finally , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the chemical potentials of free monomers , free motors and of motors bound to the gel , respectively .",
    "( [ fdot ] ) does not take into account the translational and rotational invariance of the active gel , and the variables used are therefore not the proper conjugate fluxes and forces .",
    "indeed , as shown in reference @xcite , since the free energy does not change under pure translations and rotations of the gel , ignoring surface terms , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fdot ] ) as @xmath43 the total stress @xmath44 has been decomposed into a symmetric part @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) and and anti - symmetric part which is due to the torque exerted by the field @xmath35 on the order parameter @xmath32 : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor .",
    "the current conjugate to @xmath35 includes a rotational contribution coming from the antisymmetric part of the stress tensor , it reads @xmath49 where we have used the corotational time derivative of the vector @xmath32 , @xmath50 being the vorticity tensor of the flow .",
    "we can read off eq .",
    "( [ fdot1 ] ) the following pairs of conjugate fluxes and forces : @xmath51    the rate of change of the free energy can be divided into reversible and irreversible parts @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we therefore decompose the fluxes into a reactive part and a dissipative part .",
    "they are characterized by their different signatures with respect to time - reversal .",
    "note , that the generalized forces have well - defined signatures with respect to time reversal : the rate of strain @xmath55 is odd under time reversal , while @xmath35 and @xmath27 are even .",
    "we write @xmath56 the dissipative fluxes have the same signature under time reversal as their conjugate forces , while reactive fluxes have the opposite signature under time reversal .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 is odd under time reversal , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 are even .",
    "the reactive parts have correspondingly the opposite signatures . as we show below , the currents @xmath60 do not have reactive parts . with this decomposition , the rate of entropy production @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 for a changing state of the system which is periodic in time with period @xmath63 , the internal energy is the same after one period .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath64 these relations follow from the signatures of dissipative and reactive currents under time reversal .      in the absence of a net gel polarization @xmath23 and for a passive system with @xmath65",
    ", we describe the viscoelastic gel by a maxwell model . in order to keep our expressions simple and to focus on the essential physics , we assume that the ratio of the bulk and shear viscosities is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the space dimension .",
    "the maxwell model relates the stress tensor to the strain rate according to @xmath68 here , @xmath69 denotes the shear viscosity and @xmath70 the viscoelastic relaxation time . and @xmath71 is the elastic modulus of the gel at short times . in eq .",
    "( [ maxw ] ) , the time derivative of the stress tensor taken in a reference frame moving with the material flow must be used . for a tensor",

    "@xmath74 with these relations , we have @xmath75 and the dissipative and reactive parts of the stress differ in their signature with respect to time reversal .",
    "we now generalize the relations ( [ sd ] ) and ( [ sr ] ) expressing dissipative and reactive fluxes in terms of generalized forces for an active polar gel .",

    "if the system is polar , this vector is provided by @xmath23 .",

    ", they should apply , in their principles , to all gels in which a permanent source of dissipation is at work .",
    "such gels define a new class of materials . for instance , a conventional `` physical '' polar gel , absorbing a high frequency ultrasonic wave should obey , in the low frequency , long wavelength limit , the set of equations proposed here .",
    "our main motivation however , is the construction of a generic theory for characterizing quantitatively the properties of eukaryotic biological gels .",
    "one could object that generalized hydrodynamic theories involve a large number of parameters and are thus not very useful .",
    "their merit is to involve the smallest number of parameters required for a relevant description of the systems under consideration and to describe in a unified way all long length scale and long time scale situations which are otherwise seemingly unconnected .",
    "the nature of most parameters is already well - known for gel or polymer rheology or for liquid crystal physics , and their measurement techniques can straightforwardly be transfered to active gels .",
    "this is transparent for translational , orientational elastic moduli and viscosities .",
    "coefficients linking shear flow and polar orientation are less familiar to the general public but are well known to liquid crystal physicists , and their measurements are not difficult a priori .",
    "there are six bulk and two surface additional parameters , compared to a passive polar gel . among the bulk quantities one is equivalent to the motor velocity on the actin filaments ( @xmath277 , and",
    "another one is the depolymerization rate @xmath4 of the gel in the bulk .",
    "both quantities are directly accessible to experiment .",
    "surface polymerization terms can be extracted independently from biochemical data and although they generate a new interesting physics ( @xcite ) , they do not introduce uncertainties in the description .    among the four remaining parameters , three ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 bear essentially the same physics ( i.e : the activity implies either spontaneous motion or spontaneous stress ) , and",
    "the last one @xmath84 measures the active rate of change of polarization .",
    "hence , there are only two relevant additional parameter , namely @xmath84 and @xmath96 with respect to a passive polar gel .",
    "we show , in the two examples developed here , that they change profoundly the behavior of gels : behaviors which in the absence of energy input would be static , become dynamic .",
    "the structure of the relaxation modes which would be entirely over - damped in the long wavelength limit , now can support propagative waves @xcite , spiral disclinations rotate permanently .",
    "many other consequences have to be unraveled . knowing that it has taken more than ten years to investigate the properties of generalized hydrodynamical equations relevant to liquid crystals , it is likely that a similar number of years will be necessary in this case as well .",
    "our bet is that it will help us understand the complex behavior of the slow dynamics of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton in a robust way , not depending on the details of the involved proteins .",
    "our theory can be extended in several ways .",
    "first we have ignored the permeation process of the bulk fluid through the gel .",
    "this is legitimate in the long time limit in most geometries but not all .",
    "the inclusion of permeation in our equations would be straightforward .",
    "we have also used the simplest visco - elastic gel theory : experiments performed on cells suggest the existence of scale invariant visco - elastic behavior which could also be included in the theory @xcite .",
    "at last we have assumed that the driving force was `` small '' and constant both in space and time .",
    "the spatial and temporal invariance make sense in a cell since the @xmath25 production centers seem to be abundant and evenly distributed . in vitro experiments",
    "may mimic these conditions on a limited time scale , yet large compared to most phenomena of interest .",
    "furthermore there is no a priori difficulty in introducing @xmath25 production and consumption in the equations .",
    "more severe is the last limitation : our equations are valid for @xmath27 small compared to thermal energy , whereas it is of the order of ten time that value in real life .",
    "the extension of our theory to large @xmath27 is a real challenge and will probably require some feedback from experiments .",
    "a brute force expansion in higher powers of forces and fluxes is just totally impractical and would leave out the known and probably leading exponential dependences of polymerization / depolymerization rates on stress .",
    "other challenging questions concern the nature of noise which will pick up strong out of equilibrium contributions , and possible dynamical transitions for instance in the motor behavior@xcite . for these reasons",
    ", we think that is it wise to start with the well controlled approach that we propose here and to develop the corresponding experiments .",
    "this will help us familiarize with this new physics before getting to regions of phase space were we lack guiding principles .",
    "an important application of active gels is the problem of cell locomotion on a substrate @xcite . in a forthcoming publication",
    ", we will discuss how the interplay of polymerization and activity can induce the motion of a thin layer of an active gel on a solid surface .",
    "the physics of this gel motion coupled to the properties of bio - adhesion provides a basis for an understanding of the locomotion of cells such as keratocytes @xcite .",
    "in polar coordinates , the rate of strain tensor for a rotationally symmetric velocity profile is given by @xmath278 furthermore , @xmath279    if the system is invariant by rotation , the local force balance in cylindrical coordinates is written as @xmath280 in an incompressible system , the pressure @xmath22 is a lagrange multiplier necessary to impose the incompressibility constraint .",
    "the form of equations ( [ sigmadab ] ) , ( [ pda ] ) , ( [ sigmar ] ) and ( [ pr ] ) can be understood by discussing the general dynamics of the polarization field @xmath32 in frequency space . as a function of frequency , we write to linear order @xmath281 where the tilde denotes a fourier amplitude at frequency @xmath135 .",
    "the first two terms of the right hand side correspond to a straightforward linear response theory of a ferroelectric liquid crystal .",
    "similarly , the last term provides for @xmath282 the reactive linear coupling term allowed by symmetry . for finite frequency",
    "furthermore , this term takes into account that the gel is elastic on short time scales or large @xmath135 .",
    "this can be seen as follows : in the case of an elastic gel , the free energy @xmath33 of the polarization field contains elastic terms of the form @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the strain tensor characterizing deformations of the gel .",
    "this leads to a modification of @xmath35 by @xmath285 . since in frequency space , @xmath286 , eq .",
