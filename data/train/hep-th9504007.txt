    "the classical and quantum propagation of strings in curved spacetimes has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years .",
    "the main complication , as compared to the case of flat minkowski spacetime , is related to the non - linearity of the equations of motion .",
    "it makes it possible to obtain the complete analytic solution only in a very few special cases like conical spacetime @xcite and plane - wave / shock - wave backgrounds @xcite .",
    "there are however also very general results concerning integrability and solvability for maximally symmetric spacetimes @xcite and gauged wzw models @xcite .",
    "these are the exceptional cases ; generally the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are not integrable and even if they are , it is usually an extremely difficult task to actually separate the equations , integrate them and finally write down the complete solution in closed form .",
    "fortunately , there are several different ways to `` attack '' a system of coupled non - linear partial differential equations .",
    "the systematic study of string dynamics in curved spacetimes and its associated physical phenomena was started in refs.@xcite . besides numerical methods , which will not be discussed here , approximative [ 7 - 10 ] and exact [ 11 - 14 ] methods for solving the string equations of motion and constraints in curved spacetimes , have been developed .",
    "classical and quantum string dynamics have been investigated in black hole backgrounds [ 15 - 18 ] , cosmological spacetimes [ 7 , 11 - 14 , 17 - 21 ] , cosmic string spacetime @xcite , gravitational wave backgrounds @xcite , supergravity backgrounds ( which are necessary for fermionic strings ) @xcite , and near spacetime singularities @xcite .",
    "physical phenomena like the hawking - unruh effect in string theory @xcite , horizon string stretching @xcite , particle transmutation @xcite , string scattering @xcite , mass spectrum and critical dimension @xcite , string instability [ 7 , 11 - 13 , 16 , 21 ] and multi - string solutions [ 11 - 13 , 28 ] have been found .    in a generic @xmath2-dimensional curved spacetime with metric @xmath3 and coordinates @xmath4 the string equations of motion and constraints are : @xmath5 @xmath6 where dot and prime stand for derivative with respect to the world - sheet coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively and @xmath9 are the christoffel symbols with respect to the metric @xmath10 in the following we present recent results [ 26 - 29 ] on solutions to eqs.(1.1)-(1.2 ) in a variety of curved spacetimes from cosmology , gravitation and string theory .",
    "we obtain explicit ( exact and/or approximate ) mathematical solutions , discuss the corresponding physical properties , we quantize the solutions in different ways ( canonical quantization , semi - classical quantization ) and find the physical content : the mass spectrum .    the presentation is organized as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the classical string dynamics in the @xmath0 black hole anti de sitter ( bh - ads ) spacetime , recently found by baados et al @xcite .",
    "we compare with the string dynamics in ordinary cosmological and black hole spacetimes .",
    "this clarifies the geometry ( as seen by a string ) of the bh - ads spacetime . in section 3 ,",
    "generalizing results from section 2 , we derive the quantum string mass spectrum in ordinary @xmath2-dimensional anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "we discuss , in particular , the sectors of low and very high mass states .",
    "new physical phenomena arise like the fine - structure effect at all levels beyond the graviton and the non - existence of a hagedorn critical temperature .",
    "the results are compared with corresponding results obtained in minkowski and de sitter spacetimes .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the investigation of the more general underlying structure of solutions to eqs.(1.1)-(1.2 ) . in section 4",
    ", we find new classes of exact string and multi - string solutions in cosmological and black hole spacetimes , while in section 5 , we consider the effects of a non - zero spatial curvature on the classical and quantum string dynamics in friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universes .",
    "anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetime is often considered to be a spacetime of minor importance in a cosmological context .",
    "however , first of all , it _ is _ a frw universe and as such should not be neglected , secondly ; it serves as a simple and convenient spacetime for comparison and understanding of results obtained in ( say ) minkowski or de sitter spacetimes and third , it has a tendency to show up ( in disguise ) as a solution in various models of dilaton - gravity and string theory .",
    "an example of the latter is represented by the @xmath0 bh - ads spacetime of baados et al @xcite .",
    "this spacetime background has arised much interest recently [ 31 - 35 ] .",
    "it describes a two - parameter family ( mass @xmath11 and angular momentum @xmath12 ) of black holes in 2 + 1 dimensional general relativity with metric : @xmath13 it has two horizons @xmath14 and a static limit @xmath15 defining an ergosphere , as for ordinary kerr black holes .",
    "the spacetime is not asymptotically flat ; it approaches anti de sitter spacetime asymptotically with cosmological constant @xmath16 the curvature is constant @xmath17 everywhere , except probably at @xmath18 where it has at most a delta - function singularity .",
    "notice the weak nature of the singularity at @xmath19 in 2 + 1 dimensions as compared with the power law divergence of curvature scalars in @xmath20 ( we will not discuss here the geometry near @xmath21 for a discusion , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the spacetime , eq.(2.1 ) , is also a solution of the low energy effective action of string theory with zero dilaton field @xmath22 anti - symmetric tensor field @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it yields an exact solution of string theory in 2 + 1 dimensions , obtained by gauging the wzwn sigma model of the group @xmath25 at level @xmath26 @xcite ( for non - compact groups , @xmath26 does not need to be an integer , so the central charge @xmath27 when k=52/23 ) .",
    "this solution is the black string background @xcite : @xmath28 @xmath29 which is related by duality @xcite to the 2 + 1 bh - ads spacetime , eq.(2.1 ) .",
    "it has two horizons @xmath30 the same as the metric , eq.(2.1 ) , while the static limit is @xmath31    we first investigate the string propagation in the @xmath0 bh - ads background by considering the perturbation series around the exact center of mass of the string : @xmath32 the original method of refs.@xcite can be conveniently formulated in covariant form .",
    "it is useful to introduce @xmath33 normal vectors @xmath34 ( which can be chosen to be covariantly constant by gauge fixing ) , and consider comoving perturbations @xmath35 i.e. those seen by an observer travelling with the center of mass , thus @xmath36 after fourier expansion , @xmath37 the first order perturbations satisfy the matrix schrdinger - type equation in @xmath7 : @xmath38 second order perturbations @xmath39 and constraints are similarly covariantly treated , @xmath39 also satisfying schrdinger - type equations with source terms , see ref.@xcite .    for our purposes",
    "here it is enough to consider the non - rotating @xmath40 2 + 1 bh - ads background and a radially infalling string .",
    "we have solved completely the c.m .",
    "motion @xmath41 and the first and second order perturbations @xmath42 and @xmath43 in this background .",
    "eqs.(2.4 ) become : @xmath44 the first order perturbations are independent of the black hole mass , only the anti de sitter ( ads ) part emerges .",
    "all oscillation frequencies @xmath45 are real ; there are no unstable modes in this case . the perturbations : @xmath46\\ ] ]",
    "are completely finite and regular .",
    "this is also true for the second order perturbations which are bounded everywhere , even for @xmath47 we have also computed the conformal generators @xmath48 ( see ref.@xcite ) , and the string mass : @xmath49.\\ ] ] the mass formula is modified ( by the term @xmath50 ) with respect to the usual flat spacetime expression .",
    "this is due to the asymptotic ( here ads ) behaviour of the spacetime . in ordinary @xmath1 black hole spacetimes",
    "( without cosmological constant ) , which are asymptotically flat , the mass spectrum is the same as in flat minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "we compare with the string perturbations in the ordinary ( @xmath1 ) black hole anti de sitter spacetime . in this case eqs.(2.4 ) become : @xmath51 @xmath52 the transverse @xmath53-perturbations are oscillating with real frequencies and are bounded even for @xmath54 for longitudinal @xmath55-perturbations , however , imaginary frequencies arise and instabilities develop .",
    "the @xmath56-instability sets in at : @xmath57 lower modes become unstable even outside the horizon , while higher modes develop instabilities at smaller @xmath58 and eventually only for @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( which implies @xmath61 ) we find @xmath62 and : @xmath63 @xmath64 for @xmath61 the @xmath55-perturbations blow up while the string ends trapped into the @xmath19 singularity .",
    "we see the important difference between the string evolution in the 2 + 1 bh - ads background and the ordinary 3 + 1 ( or higher dimensional ) black hole anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "we also compare with the string propagation in the 2 + 1 black string background , eq.(2.2 ) ( with @xmath65 ) . in this case , eqs.(2.4 ) become : @xmath66 @xmath67 the @xmath53-modes are stable , while @xmath68 develop instabilities . for @xmath60 ( which implies @xmath61 ) we find @xmath69 and : @xmath70 with similar conclusions as for the ordinary 3 + 1 ( or higher dimensional ) black hole anti de sitter spacetime . in order to extract more information about the string evolution in these backgrounds , in particular exact properties",
    ", we consider the circular string ansatz : @xmath71 in the equatorial plane @xmath72 of the stationary axially symmetric backgrounds : @xmath73 this includes all the cases of interest here : the 2 + 1 bh - ads spacetime , the black string , as well as the equatorial plane of ordinary einstein black holes .",
    "the string dynamics , determined by eqs.(1.1)-(1.2 ) , is then reduced to a system of second order ordinary differential equations and constraints , also described as a hamiltonian system : @xmath74 @xmath75 which in all backgrounds considered here are solved in terms of either elementary or elliptic functions .",
    "the dynamics of the circular strings takes place at the @xmath58-axis in the @xmath76-diagram and from the properties of the potential @xmath77 ( minima , zeroes , asymptotic behaviour for large @xmath58 and the value @xmath78 ) , general knowledge about the string motion can be obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "the line element of the circular string turns out to be : @xmath79 @xmath80 being the invariant string size .",
    "for all the static black hole ads spacetimes ( 2 + 1 and higher dimensional ) : @xmath81    for the rotating 2 + 1 bh - ads spacetime : @xmath82 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "@xmath77 has a global minimum @xmath83 between the two horizons @xmath84 ( for @xmath85 otherwise there are no horizons ) .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath77 at @xmath86 ( see ref.@xcite ) determines three different types of solutions : ( i ) for @xmath87 there are two positive zeroes @xmath88 the string never comes outside the static limit , never falls into @xmath19 neither ( there is a barrier between @xmath89 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the mathematical solution oscillates between @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 it may be interpreted as a string travelling between the different universes described by the maximal analytic extension of the manifold .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath93 there is only one positive zero @xmath94 outside the static limit and there is no barrier preventing the string from collapsing into @xmath19 .",
    "the string starts at @xmath95 with maximal size @xmath96 outside the static limit , it then contracts through the ergosphere and the two horizons and eventually collapses into a point @xmath21 for @xmath97 it may be still possible to continue this solution into another universe like in the case ( i ) .",
    "( iii ) @xmath98 is the limiting case where the maximal string size equals the static limit : @xmath99 in this case @xmath100 thus the string contracts through the two horizons and eventually collapses into a point @xmath21    the exact general solution in the three cases ( i)-(iii ) is given by : @xmath101 where : @xmath102 @xmath103 are constants in terms of @xmath104 given in ref.@xcite , and @xmath105 is the weierstrass elliptic @xmath105-function with invariants @xmath106 discriminant @xmath107 and roots @xmath108 also given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the three cases ( i)-(iii ) correspond to the cases @xmath109 @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath112 in the case ( i ) , @xmath113 can be written in terms of the jacobian elliptic function @xmath114,\\;\\tau^*=\\sqrt{e_1-e_3}\\;\\tau,\\;k=\\sqrt{(e_2- e_3)/(e_1-e_3)}.$ ] it follows that the solution ( i ) oscillates between the two zeroes @xmath90 and @xmath91 of @xmath115 with period @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the real semi - period of the weierstrass function : @xmath118 in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xmath119 we have : @xmath120 in the case ( ii ) ( @xmath110 ) two roots ( @xmath121 ) become complex , the string collapses into a point @xmath19 and we have : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the real semi - period of the weierstrass function for this case . in the case ( iii ) ( @xmath124 ) the elliptic functions reduce to hyperbolic functions : @xmath125 so that : @xmath126 here , the string starts as a point , grows until @xmath127 ( at @xmath95 ) , and then it contracts until it collapses again ( @xmath19 ) at @xmath128 in this case the string makes only one oscillation between @xmath19 and @xmath129    notice that for the static background ( @xmath65 ) , the only allowed motion is ( ii ) , i.e. @xmath130 ( there is no ergosphere and only one horizon in this case ) , with : @xmath131 for @xmath132 the string collapses into @xmath19 and stops there . the penrose diagram of the 2 + 1 bh - ads spacetime for @xmath65 is very similar to the penrose diagram of the ordinary ( @xmath1 ) schwarzschild spacetime , so the string motion outwards from @xmath19 is unphysical because of the causal structure .",
    "the coordinate time @xmath133 can be expressed in terms of the incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind @xmath134 see ref.@xcite .",
    "the string has its maximal size @xmath135 at @xmath136 passes the horizon at @xmath137 ( expressed in terms of an incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind ) and falls into @xmath19 for @xmath138 @xmath123 being the real semi - period of the weierstrass function .",
    "that is , we have : @xmath139 and @xmath140 can be expressed in terms of the jacobian zeta function @xmath141 see ref.@xcite .",
    "we also study the circular strings in the ordinary @xmath1 spacetimes . in the generic 3 + 1 kerr anti de sitter ( or kerr de sitter ) spacetime , the potential @xmath77 is however quite complicated , see ref.@xcite . the general circular string solution involves higher genus elliptic functions and it is not necessary to go into details here .",
    "we will compare with the non - rotating cases , only .",
    "it is instructive to recall @xcite the circular string in minkowski spacetime ( min ) , for which @xmath142 ( fig.2a ) , the string oscillates between its maximal size @xmath143 and @xmath19 with the solution @xmath144    in the schwarzschild black hole ( s ) @xmath145 ( fig.2b ) , the solution is remarkably simple : @xmath146 the mathematical solution oscillates between @xmath147 and @xmath148 but because of the causal structure and the curvature singularity the motion can not be continued after the string has collapsed into @xmath21    for anti de sitter spacetime ( ads ) , we find : @xmath149 ( fig.2c ) .",

    "the invariants , the discriminant and the roots are also given explicitly in ref.@xcite .",
    "the string starts with @xmath127 at @xmath136 it then contracts and eventually collapses into the @xmath19 singularity .",
    "the existence of elliptic function solutions for the string motion is characteristic of the presence of a cosmological constant . for @xmath159",
    "the circular string motion reduces to simple trigonometric functions . from fig.2 and our analysis",
    "we see that the circular string motion is qualitatively very similar in all these backgrounds ( min , s , ads , s - ads ) : the string has a maximal _ bounded _ size and then it contracts towards @xmath21 there are however physical and quantitative differences : in minkowski and pure anti de sitter spacetimes , the string truly oscillates between @xmath135 and @xmath18 while in the black hole cases ( s , s - ads ) , there is only one half oscillation , the string motion stops at @xmath21 this also holds for the 2 + 1 bh - ads spacetime with @xmath65 ( fig.1b ) .",
    "notice also that in all these cases , @xmath160 and @xmath161 for @xmath162    the similarity can be pushed one step further by considering small perturbations around the circular strings .",
    "we find @xcite : @xmath163 determining the fourier components of the comoving perturbations .",
    "for the spacetimes of interest here , @xmath164 ( min , s , ads , s - ads ) , or @xmath165 ( 2 + 1 bh - ads ) , the comoving perturbations are regular except near @xmath18 where we find ( for all cases ) @xmath166 and : @xmath167 it follows that not only the unperturbed circular strings , but also the comoving perturbations around them behave in a similar way in all these non - rotating backgrounds ( 2 + 1 and higher dimensional ) .",
    "this should be contrasted with the string perturbations around the center of mass , which behave differently in these backgrounds .",
    "it must be noticed that for rotating ( @xmath168 ) spacetimes , the circular string behaviour is qualitatively different from the non - rotating ( @xmath65 ) spacetimes . for large @xmath169 both in the 2 + 1 bh - ads as well as in the 3 + 1 ordinary kerr - ads spacetimes , non - collapsing circular string solutions exist .",
    "the potential @xmath170 for @xmath60 and no collapse into @xmath19 is possible .",
    "the dynamics of circular strings in curved spacetimes is determined by the string tension , which tends to contract the string , and by the local gravity ( which may be attractive or repulsive ) . in all the previous non - rotating backgrounds , the local gravity is attractive ( i.e. @xmath171 ) , and it acts together with the string tension in the sense of contraction .",
    "but in spacetimes with regions in which repulsion ( i.e. @xmath172 ) dominates , the strings can expand with unbounded radius ( unstable strings @xcite ) .",
    "it may also happen that the string tension and the local gravity be of the same order , i.e. the two opposite effects can balance , and the string is stationary .",
    "de sitter spacetime provides an example in which all such type of solutions exist @xcite . in de sitter spacetime",
    ", @xmath77 is unbounded from below for @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) and unbounded expanding circular strings are present . in addition , an interesting new feature appears in the presence of a positive cosmological constant : the existence of _ multi - string _ solutions [ 9 - 11 ] .",
    "the world - sheet time @xmath7 turns out to be a multi ( finite or infinite ) valued function of the physical time .",
    "that is , one single world - sheet where @xmath175 can describe many ( even infinitely many @xcite ) different and independent strings ( in flat spacetime , one single world - sheet describes only one string ) . in the s ,",
    "ads and s - ads spacetimes , the multi - string feature for circular strings is absent .",
    "the main conclusions of this section are given in tables 1 , 2 .",
    "further details can be found in ref.@xcite",
    "in the first part of the previous section , the classical string dynamics was studied in the @xmath0 bh - ads spacetime . in this section",
    "we go further in the investigation of the physical properties of strings in ads spacetime , by performing string quantization .",
    "since the @xmath0 bh - ads spacetime is locally ads , the results of section 2 can be extended to classical strings in @xmath2-dimensional ads spacetime as well . in ads",
    "spacetime , the string motion is oscillatory in time and is _ stable _ ; all fluctuations around the string center of mass are well behaved and bounded . local gravity of ads spacetime is always negative and string instabilities do not develop .",
    "the string perturbation series approach , considering fluctuations around the center of mass , is particularly appropriate in ads spacetime , the natural dimensionless expansion parameter being @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the string tension and the ` hubble constant ' @xmath178 the negative cosmological constant of ads spacetime is related to the ` hubble constant ' @xmath179 by @xmath180    all the spatial ( @xmath181 ) modes in @xmath2-dimensional ads , oscillate with frequency @xmath182 which are real for all @xmath183 ( @xmath184 being the string mass ) . in this section ,",
    "we perform a canonical quantization procedure . from the conformal generators @xmath185 and the constraints @xmath186 imposed at the quantum level , we obtain the mass formula ( the quantum version of eq.(2.7 ) written in units where @xmath177 appears explicitly ) : @xmath187,\\ ] ] where : @xmath188 and we have applied symmetric ordering of the operators .",

    "exact _ solution of the mass formula in @xmath196 and that there is a graviton at @xmath197 which indicates , as in de sitter space @xcite , that the critical dimension of ads is 25 ( although it should be stressed that the question whether these spacetimes are solutions to the full @xmath198-function equations remains open ) . as in minkowski spacetime ,",
    "the ground state is a tachyon .",
    "remarkably enough , for @xmath199 we find that a generic feature of all excited states beyond the graviton , is the presence of a _ fine structure _ effect : for a given eigenvalue @xmath200 the corresponding states have different masses . for the lower mass states the expectation value of the mass operator in the corresponding states ( generically labelled @xmath201 ) turns out to have the form ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath202 the collective index `` j '' generically labels the state @xmath201 and the coefficients @xmath203 are all well computed numbers , different for each state , their precise values are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the corrections to the mass in minkowski spacetime appear to order @xmath204 therefore , the leading regge trajectory for the lower mass states is : @xmath205 in minkowski spacetime the mass and number operator of the string are related by @xmath206 in ads ( as well as in de sitter ( ds ) ) , there is no such simple relation between the mass and the number operators ; the splitting of levels increases considerably for very large @xmath207 the _ fine structure _ effect we find here is also present in de sitter space . up",
    "to order @xmath208 the lower mass states in ds and in ads are the same , the differences appear to the order @xmath209 the lower mass states in de sitter spacetime are given by eq.(3.6 ) but with the @xmath210-term getting an opposite sign ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "for the very high mass spectrum , we find more drastic effects .",

    "since @xmath217 we see from eq.(3.8 ) that the masses of the high mass states are _ independent _ of @xmath218 in minkowski spacetime , very large @xmath219 states all have the same mass @xmath220 but here in ads the masses of the high mass states with the same eigenvalue @xmath219 are _ different _ by factors @xmath221 in addition , because of the fine structure effect , states with different @xmath219 can get mixed up . for high mass states , the level spacing _ grows _ with @xmath219 ( instead of being constant as in minkowski spacetime ) . as a consequence , the density of states @xmath222 as a function of mass grows like @xmath223 $ ] ( instead of @xmath224 $ ] as in minkowski spacetime ) , and _ independently _ of @xmath218 the partition function for a gas of strings at a temperature @xmath225 in ads spacetime is well defined for all finite temperatures @xmath226 discarding the existence of the hagedorn temperature .    for the low mass states ( @xmath192 ) in anti de sitter spacetime , our results can be written as @xcite : @xmath227 where `` @xmath228 '' is a collective index labelling the state @xmath229 it is now important to notice that @xmath230 for _ all _ the low mass states @xcite , i.e. there is no `` constant '' term on the right hand side of eq.(3.10 ) .",
    "a non - zero @xmath231-term would give rise to a @xmath177-independent contribution to the string mass .",
    "its absense , on the other hand , means that the first term on the right hand side of eq.(3.10 ) is super - dominant ( since , in all cases , @xmath232 ) and that the string scale is therefore set by @xmath233    for the high mass states ( @xmath234 ) we found instead @xcite : @xmath235 where the number @xmath236 depends on the state .",
    "the right hand side of eq.(3.11 ) is exactly like a non - zero dominant @xmath231-term in eq.(3.10 ) . for the high mass states the scale is therefore set by @xmath237 which is equal to the absolute value of the cosmological constant @xmath238 ( up to a geometrical factor ) and _ independent _ of @xmath218",
    "this suggests that for @xmath191 the masses of _ all _ string states can be represented by a formula of the form ( 3.10 ) .",
    "for the low mass states @xmath239 while for the high mass states @xmath231 becomes a large positive number .",
    "in the black string background , eq.(2.2 ) , we have calculated explicitly the first and second order string fluctuations around the center of mass @xcite .",
    "we then determined the world - sheet energy - momentum tensor and we derived the mass formula in the asymptotic region .",
    "the mass spectrum is equal to the mass spectrum in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "therefore , for a gas of strings at temperature @xmath225 in the asymptotic region of the black string background , the partition function goes like : @xmath240 which is only defined for @xmath241 i.e. there is a hagedorn temperature : @xmath242 in higher dimensional ( @xmath1 ) black hole spacetimes the next step now would be to set up a scattering formalism , where a string from an asymptotic in - state interacts with the gravitational field of the black hole and reappears in an asymptotic out - state @xcite",
    ". however , this is not possible in the black string background . in the uncharged black string background under consideration here , _",
    "all _ null and timelike geodesics incoming from spatial infinity pass through the horizon and fall into the physical singularity @xcite .",
    "no `` angular momentum '' , as in the case of scattering off the ordinary schwarzschild black hole , can prevent a point particle from falling into the singularity .",
    "the string solutions considered here are based on perturbations around the string center of mass which follows , at least approximately , a point particle geodesic .",
    "therefore , a string incoming from spatial infinity inevitably falls into the singularity in the black string background .",
    "in this section we return to the string equations of motion and constraints , eqs.(1.1)-(1.2 ) , to look for new classes of exact solutions . in most spacetimes , quite general families of exact solutions",

    "_ grows _ but stays _",
    "finite_. this should be compared with the straight string inside the horizon of the schwarzschild black hole , where the string size grows indefinetely .",
    "the physical reason for this difference is that the point @xmath19 is not a strong curvature singularity in the @xmath0 bh - ads spacetime .",
    "we have considered also the schwarzschild de sitter and schwarzschild anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "these spacetimes contain all the features of the spacetimes already discussed : singularities , horizons , positive or negative cosmological constants .",

    "the details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we close this section with a few remarks on the stability of the solutions .",
    "generally , the question of stability must be addressed by considering small perturbations around the exact solutions . in ref.@xcite , a covariant formalism describing physical perturbations propagating along an arbitrary string configuration embedded in an arbitrary curved spacetime , was developed .",
    "the resulting equations determining the evolution of the perturbations are however very complicated in the general case , although partial ( analytical ) results have been obtained in special cases for de sitter @xcite and schwarzschild black hole @xcite spacetimes . the exact solutions found in this section fall essentially into two classes : dynamical and stationary .",
    "the dynamical string solutions outside the horizon of de sitter ( or s - ds ) and inside the horizon of schwarzschild ( or s - ds , s - ads ) spacetimes , are already unstable at the zeroth order approximation ( i.e. without including small perturbations ) , in the sense that their physical length grows indefinetely . for the stationary string solutions the situation is more delicate .",
    "the existence of the stationary configurations is based on an exact balance between the string tension and the local attractive or repulsive gravity .",
    "for that reason , it can be expected that the configurations are actually unstable for certain modes of perturbation , especially in strong curvature regions .",
    "the main conclusions of this section are given in table 4 .",
    "further details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the propagation of strings in friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies has been investigated using both exact and approximative methods , see for example refs.[7 , 11 - 14 , 17 - 20 ] ( as well as numerical methods , which shall not be discussed here ) . except for anti de sitter spacetime , which has negative spatial curvature ,",
    "the cosmologies that have been considered until now , have all been spatially flat . in this section",
    "we will consider the physical effects of a non - zero ( positive or negative ) curvature index on the classical and quantum strings .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the riemann tensor for the generic d - dimensional frw line element , in comoving coordinates : @xmath285 are given by : @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the scale factor and @xmath288 is the curvature index .",
    "clearly , a non - zero curvature index introduces a non - zero spacetime curvature ; the exceptional case provided by @xmath289 corresponds to the milne - universe . from eqs.(5.2 ) , it is also seen that the curvature index has to compete with the first derivative of the scale factor .",
    "the effects of the curvature index are therefore most conveniently discussed in the family of frw - universes with constant scale factor , the so - called static robertson - walker spacetimes .",
    "this is the point of view we take in the present section .",
    "we consider both the closed ( @xmath290 ) and the hyperbolic ( @xmath291 ) static robertson - walker spacetimes , and all our results are compared with the already known results in the flat ( @xmath292 ) minkowski spacetime .",
    "we determine the evolution of circular strings , derive the corresponding equations of state ( using eq.(4.6 ) ) , discuss the question of strings as self - consistent solutions to the einstein equations @xcite , and we perform a semi - classical quantization .",
    "we also find all the stationary string configurations in these spacetimes .",
    "the radius of a classical circular string in the spacetime ( 5.1 ) , for @xmath293 is determined by : @xmath294 where @xmath295 is an integration constant ( @xmath296 in the notation of eqs.(2.18)-(2.19 ) ) .",
    "this equation is solved in terms of elliptic functions and all solutions describe oscillating strings ( fig.7 shows the potential @xmath77 for @xmath297 ) .    for @xmath298 when the spatial section is a hypersphere , the string either oscillates on one hemisphere or on the full hypersphere .",
    "the energy is always positive while the average pressure can be positive , negative or zero , depending on the precise value of an elliptic modulus ; the equation of state is given explicitly in table 5 , in the different cases .",
    "interestingly enough , we find that the circular strings provide a self - consistent solution to the einstein equations with a selected value of the curvature index .",
    "self - consistent solutions to the einstein equations with string sources have been found previously in the form of power law expanding universes @xcite .",
    "we have semi - classically quantized the circular string solutions of eq.(5.3 ) .",
    "we used an approach developed in field theory by dashen et .",
    "@xcite , based on the stationary phase approximation of the partition function .",
    "the result of the stationary phase integration is expressed in terms of the function : @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the action of the classical solution , @xmath184 is the mass and the period @xmath301 is implicitly given by : @xmath302 the bound state quantization condition then becomes @xcite : @xmath303 for @xmath183 ` large ' .",
    "parametric plots of @xmath304 as a function of @xmath305 in the different cases , are shown in fig.8 .",

    "when the spatial section is a hyperboloid , both the energy and the average pressure of the oscillating strings are positive .",
    "the equation of state is given in table 5 .",

    "the mass - formula is given by ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath313 notice that the level spacing grows faster than in minkowski spacetime but slower than in the closed static robertson - walker spacetime .    on the other hand , the stationary strings are determined by eqs.(4.4 ) : @xmath314 where @xmath251 is an integration constant ( fig.9 shows the potential @xmath77 for @xmath297 ) .    for @xmath298 all the stationary string solutions",
    "describe circular strings winding around the hypersphere .",
    "the equation of state is of the extremely unstable string type @xcite . for @xmath312 the stationary strings",
    "are represented by infinitely long open configurations with an angle between the two `` arms '' given by : @xmath315 the energy density is positive while the pressure densities are negative .",
    "no simple equation of state is found for these solutions .",
    "we also computed the first and second order fluctuations around a static string center of mass , using the string perturbation series approach @xcite and its covariant versions @xcite . up to second order",
    ", the mass - formula for arbitrary values of the curvature index ( positive or negative ) is identical to the well - known flat spacetime mass - formula ; all dependence on @xmath288 cancels out .",
    "we first studied the string propagation in the 2 + 1 bh - ads background .",
    "we found the first and second order perturbations around the string center of mass as well as the mass formula , and compared with the ordinary black hole ads spacetime and with the black string background as well .",
    "these results were then generalized to ordinary @xmath2-dimensional anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "the classical string motion in anti de sitter spacetime is stable in the sense that it is oscillatory in time with real frequencies and the string size and energy are bounded .",
    "quantum mechanically , this reflects in the mass operator , which is well defined for any value of the wave number @xmath316 and arbitrary high mass states ( and therefore an infinite number of states ) can be constructed .",
    "this is to be contrasted with de sitter spacetime , where string instabilities develop , in the sense that the string size and energy become unbounded for large de sitter radius . for low mass states ( the stable regime ) ,",
    "the mass operator in de sitter spacetime is given by eq.(3.1 ) but with @xmath317 real mass solutions can be defined only up to some _ maximal mass _ of the order @xmath318 @xcite . for @xmath191 real mass solutions",
    "can be defined only for @xmath319 ( where @xmath219 is the eigenvalue of the number operator ) and therefore there exists a _",
    "finite _ number of states only .",
    "these features of strings in de sitter spacetime have been recently confirmed within a different ( semi - classical ) quantization approach based on _ exact _ circular string solutions @xcite .",
    "the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath238 ( positive or negative ) increases considerably the number of levels of different eigenvalue of the mass operator ( there is a splitting of levels ) with respect to flat spacetime .",
    "that is , a non - zero cosmological constant _ decreases _ ( although does not remove ) the degeneracy of the string mass states , introducing a _ fine structure effect_. for the low mass states the level spacing is approximately constant ( up to corrections of the order @xmath320 ) . for the high mass states , the changes are more drastic and they depend crucially on the sign of @xmath321 a value @xmath322 causes the _ growing _ of the level spacing linearly with @xmath219 instead of being constant as in minkowski space .",
    "consequently , the density of states @xmath222 grows with the exponential of @xmath323 ( instead of @xmath184 as in minkowski space ) discarding the existence of a hagedorn temperature in ads spacetime , and the possibility of a phase transition .",
    "in addition , another important feature of the high mass string spectrum in ads spacetime is that it becomes independent of @xmath218 the string scale for the high mass states is given by @xmath324 instead of @xmath325 for the low mass states .",
    "we have found new classes of exact string solutions obtained either by the circular string ansatz , eq.(2.16 ) , or by the stationary string ansatz , eq.(4.3 ) , in a variety of curved backgrounds including schwarzschild , de sitter and anti de sitter spacetimes .",
    "many different types of solutions have been found : oscillating circular strings , closed stationary strings , infinitely long stationary strings , dynamical straight strings and multi - string solutions describing finitely or infinitely many stationary or dynamical strings .",
    "in all the cases we have obtained the exact solutions in terms of either elementary or elliptic functions .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the physical properties ( length , energy , pressure ) of the string solutions .",
    "finally , we solved the equations of motion and constraints for circular strings in static robertson - walker spacetimes .",
    "we computed the equations of state and found that there exists a self - consistent solution to the einstein equations in the case of positive spatial curvature .",
    "the solutions were quantized semi - classically using the stationary phase approximation method , and the resulting spectra were analyzed and discussed .",
    "we have also found all stationary string configurations in these spacetimes and we computed the corresponding physical quantities , string length , energy and pressure .",
