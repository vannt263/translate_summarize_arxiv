    "in anticipation of the lhc , one would like to explore the broadest range of possible scenarios . motivated by this , georgi considered @xcite a class of models with a hidden conformal field theory ( cft ) sector , which couples to the standard model ( sm ) fields in the ultraviolet ( uv ) . at low energies ,",
    "this coupling gives rise to effective interactions between the sm and the cft .",
    "as an example , a vector current in the sm could be coupled to a vector operator @xmath4 in the cft via @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath7 is the conformal dimension of @xmath4 , not necessarily an integer .",
    "models of this type have rather unusual experimental signatures , in that they do not predict a discrete set of new particles , as in commonly considered scenarios of tev - scale extra dimensions or supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , cfts do not even have `` in '' or `` out '' states .",
    "rather , the new physics comes in the form of something less intuitive , dubbed `` unparticle stuff '' by georgi @xcite .",
    "how can one think about unparticles ?",
    "georgi originally envisioned a cft sector composed of a nonabelian gauge group with a set of new fermion fields .",
    "the coupling constants in this sector were assumed to flow into a nontrivial infrared ( ir ) fixed point , _ a la _ banks - zaks @xcite , at some scale @xmath8 , which is above the energies of the experiments , but below the mass scale @xmath9 of the messenger fields coupling the sector to the sm .",
    "this theory shares many features with qcd @xcite .",
    "as the hidden sector `` partons '' are produced in a collision of sm particles , they undergo a qcd - like showering process , in which particles eventually hadronize if the theory confines at some scale in the far infrared ( ir ) @xcite . in the limit of exact conformal invariance in the ir",
    ", the showering process never stops , hence the theory does not have non - interacting `` out '' states .",
    "many properties of unparticles can be inferred from conformal invariance alone , without going into the details of the complicated dynamics .",
    "using such arguments , unparticles were shown to possess several curious properties .",
    "when produced in the final state , they behave as a noninteger number of massless particles @xcite . when they mediate interactions between sm particles ,",
    "the corresponding propagator has a nontrivial phase @xcite .",
    "both of these properties follow from the spectral representation of the `` unparticle propagator '' , which , as argued in @xcite , by scale invariance has to have the form @xmath10 the integral in this equation converges only when @xmath11 .",
    "several other crucial features of unparticles have been pointed out more recently by grinstein , intriligator , and rothstein ( gir ) @xcite . using a combination of arguments based on conformal symmetry and on the properties of the banks - zaks model ( which is at weak t hooft coupling )",
    ", gir found that :    * the value of @xmath7 is limited _ from below _ by unitarity @xcite .",
    "( in the context of unparticle physics , this was also noted in @xcite . ) in particular , for primary , gauge invariant vector cft operators , one must have @xmath1 .",
    "thus , for such operators the interval @xmath11 on which the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectralintegral ] ) converges is completely excluded by unitarity . * the value of @xmath7",
    "is not limited _ from above_. for @xmath12 , the unparticle scenario must additionally contain contact interactions between the sm fields .",
    "these contact interactions are _ necessary _ to cure the divergence in the spectral integral . *",
    "these contact interactions are very important phenomenologically , as they _",
    "dominate _ over the unparticles in sm - sm scattering processes .",
    "* the tensor structure of the propagator is fixed by the conformal group @xcite .",
    "the propagator in general ( for @xmath13 ) is not transverse , as that would be incompatible with conformal symmetry .",
    "this affects the rates for certain processes involving unparticles .",
    "the picture of `` unparticle stuff '' as an `` infinite shower '' provides important physical intuition , but the resulting complicated set of qcd - like diagrams is not trivial to deal with , especially at strong coupling .",
    "in particular , the properties laid out above look rather mysterious in this framework .",
    "does a noninteger number of massless particles represent something physical in the infinite shower ?",
    "since the presence of an imaginary part in a propagator usually indicates some intermediate states go on - shell , what goes on - shell in the cft sector , which does not have discrete states of definite mass ? can the unitarity bound on @xmath7 and the dominance of the contact terms be understood in simple , intuitive terms ?",
    "in fact , we note that it took some time to realize the crucial features of unparticles given by gir .",
    "one may naturally wonder if there exists a different way of thinking about unparticles that is ( i ) more intuitive and ( ii ) more treatable than a yang - mills hidden sector at strong coupling .",
    "a natural candidate to examine are models based on warped extra dimensions .",
    "the possibility of describing features of the cft sector in this framework is strongly suggested by the celebrated ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the idea has been discussed by several authors , to a varying degree of detail . already in @xcite",
    "it is mentioned that scenarios with infinite extra dimensions , as introduced by randall and sundrum @xcite , can have `` unparticle - like behavior '' ( without elaboration ) .",
    "@xcite proposes to realize a scenario of deconstructed unparticles in the two - brane setup .",
    "similar ideas are also discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , a recent work by cacciapaglia , marandella , and terning ( cmt ) @xcite , containing the most detailed analysis of the problem to date , arrives at several important results , as described later .",
    "there seems to be no consensus , however , on whether such `` holographic '' ( _ i.e. _ , based on the ads / cft correspondence ) constructions should be regarded as genuine models of unparticle physics .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite , which appeared after @xcite , remarks that `` to date no explicit model has been constructed that would exhibit unparticle behavior ''",
    "@xcite also do not use ads constructions to model unparticles . on the other hand , refs .",
    "@xcite do refer to their respective ads - based constructions as unparticle models .",
    "also , ref .",
    "@xcite notes that the soft - wall models in the randall - sundrum @xcite limit should describe unparticle physics .",
    "note that the issue does not reduce to questioning the validity of the ads / cft correspondence : a model of unparticles should incorporate not only the scale - invariant sector , but also the breaking of scale invariance at the dimensional transmutation scale and the coupling of the uv theory to the sm @xcite .",
    "what basic checks can one perform ? as a true model , an ads - based construction must reproduce _ all _ of the known properties of unparticles . as an approximate description , on the other hand , it could reproduce some of the properties , but fail on others ( _ a la _ ads / qcd @xcite ) .",
    "examining the ads / unparticle literature , one does not get a clear confirmation that all unparticle properties are present .",
    "while , as mentioned , the contact terms are seen on the ads side ( as shown by cmt ) , the unitarity bounds on the operator dimensions are not seen .",
    "moreover , some discussions seem to imply an upper bound on @xmath7 , in contrast to gir .",
    "even the phase of the propagator , which uniquely follows from scale invariance @xcite , does not explicitly appear .",
    "going beyond the unparticle literature , one can find many important results in the earlier studies of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) models and their connection to the ads / cft correspondence , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "in particular , properties such as the contact terms @xcite and the imaginary part of the propagator @xcite were noted .",
    "other questions , however , _",
    "e.g. _ , the unitarity properties of the rs models do not seem to have been investigated .    in what follows",
    ", we consider a very simple scenario : the randall - sundrum 2 ( rs 2 ) model where a single positive tension minkowski brane is sandwiched between two anti - desitter 5d regions . the sm fields are localized on the brane and a single massive vector field can propagate in the bulk .",
    "when considered at scales much below the ads curvature @xmath14 , this model will be seen to satisfy all of the properties of unparticles listed above : the phase of the cft propagator , the contact terms and cancellations , the unitarity bounds , and the tensor structure . moreover",
    ", we will see that the model resolves the singularities of the `` contact terms '' : they correspond to finite range interactions and disappear above the scale @xmath14 .",
    "our analysis also almost trivially leads to the unitarity bounds on the conformal dimension of cft vector operators in @xmath3 spacetime dimensions . these and other results are discussed after all of the properties of unparticles are confirmed .    in the interests of clarity ,",
    "this paper focuses on conceptual points .",
    "detailed derivations will be given in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , we consider a model with a single vector field in the rs 2 bulk and sm fields on the brane . the physical meaning of the unparticle propagator is simple : it is the brane - to - brane propagator of the bulk vector .",
    "the propagator is the green s function of the following equation @xcite ( @xmath15 denotes the warp factor in the metric , @xmath16 ) : @xmath17\\partial_5 a^{\\mu } \\right )    + m^2_5 a^2 a_\\nu = 0 ~.\\ ] ] two crucial physical ingredients are as follows .",
    "* first , the field has a bulk mass , @xmath18 . in ads",
    "/ cft , this mass is known to control the conformal dimension of the resulting vector cft operator @xcite . with @xmath19 ,",
    "the vector field has four degrees of freedom . from the 4-dimensional point of view",
    ", it has three transverse polarizations ( @xmath20 ) and one longitudinal ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the longitudinal component is often omitted in the literature .",
    "it is important to keep it : first , it is essential for obtaining the correct tensor structure that respects conformal symmetry ; second , it is crucial for our unitarity arguments . *",
    "second , in deriving the propagator ( green s function ) , we need to fix the boundary conditions away from the brane .",
    "physically , collisions of the sm particles on the brane result in outgoing waves of the bulk vector .",

    "we will return to the analytic properties of the propagator later .",
    "_ unitarity _ : the imaginary part of the propagator has a direct physical meaning in the rs 2 setup , as will be discussed later .",
    "namely , it tells us about the width of the `` escape into extra dimensions '' .",
    "this width clearly has to be nonnegative , not to violate unitarity .",
    "this must hold for any choice of the wavefunctions that the propagator is sandwiched between . therefore , it must hold separately for the transverse and longitudinal modes . the relative sign between them can only be correct if @xmath62 as follows from inspecting eqs .",

    "it can be shown that this condition is not only necessary , but also sufficient for unitarity @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : ourunitarity ] ) in fact turns out to be more general , as discussed later .",
    "we now discuss several issues in unparticle physics , for which the rs 2 realization provides helpful insights .    _ spectral representation as a sum over kk modes _ : let us return to the spectral representation , eq .",

    "notably , ref .",
    "@xcite specifically proposed to realize a scalar field with continuously distributed mass as a scalar living in a flat five - dimensional spacetime coupling to the sm fields on the brane .",
    "the connection between flat extra dimensions and unparticles was also noted in , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "what the rs 2 construction brings to this picture is a way to control the relative couplings of different kk modes to fields on the brane .",
    "the physics of this is most transparent upon transforming the field equation for the bulk field into the form of the schrdinger equation .",

    "e.g. _ , in @xcite ( in the context of the rs 2 scenarios extended with additional compact dimensions @xcite ) . in the schrdinger description , the low - energy bulk kk modes have to tunnel through a potential @xmath66 to reach the brane , where @xmath67 is a function of @xmath68 . as can be easily seen @xcite , for this particular potential",
    "the wavefunctions on the brane are _ power - law _ , rather than exponentially , suppressed , leading to a cft behavior .",

    "the unparticles `` leak out '' into the bulk because of the incomplete gravitational binding ( or , equivalently tunnel under the volcano potential ) .",
    "the physical discussion of this escape is given in refs .",
    "this escape corresponds to the unparticle production .",
    "even though in an experiment , it appears as the production of an integer or noninteger number of massless four - dimensional particles ( `` neutrinos '' ) @xcite , in the rs 2 model what is produced is a single kk plane wave , which is massive from the four - dimensional point of view .",
    "notice that , once escaped , the bulk particles do not re - interact with the brane fields , unless the extra dimension is compactified ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) .",
    "notice also that the analytic ( `` contact '' ) terms in the expansion of the rs 2 propagator do not have imaginary parts .",
    "physically , this is because they correspond to heavy degrees of freedom , as will be discussed shortly .",
    "these heavy degrees of freedom are exchanged far off - shell , without exciting asymptotic outgoing plane waves far from the brane .",
    "since the analytic terms dominate at low @xmath69 , the phase of the complete propagator is rather small .",
    "the phase factor multiplying the nonanalytic piece , @xmath70 , by itself is not particularly meaningful : for example , the fact that it becomes real at integer @xmath7 in no way implies that the unparticles do not escape from the brane in that case .",
    "all that happens is the @xmath71 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : longitudinal_branetobrane_expand_mink ] ) blows up there ; this divergence is , however , cancelled by the corresponding analytic term . on the other hand ,",

    "it is important that this does not violate the unitarity bound on vector operators in cft : the bound only applies to gauge invariant operators and in this limit the longitudinal polarization becomes a gauge degree of freedom .",
    "( the longitudinal propagator is seen to blow up . ) for finite @xmath18 , all four polarizations on the brane are physical , but the theory in the flat space limit is not conformal .",

    "subdominant_. ( ii ) the leading terms in the low - momentum expansion ( @xmath113 , @xmath38 , ... ) have the form of contact interactions . yet , contrary to some discussions in the literature , no contact interactions are seen in position space .    to understand point ( i ) , consider the following mathematical property of fourier transforms @xcite .",
    "if a function is analytic everywhere on the real axis , its high frequency fourier modes are suppressed _",
    "exponentially_. the exponential factor is determined by the distance from the closest singularity to the real axis .",
    "when the function has a point of nonanalyticity on the real axis , its high frequency fourier modes are only power suppressed .",
    "simply put , `` sharp features '' of the function ( discontinuities , cusps , etc ) carry the high frequency signal .    in light of this , consider the rs 2 propagator .",
    "schematically , it is the sum of two pieces , one of which ( @xmath47 ) has a singularity on the real axis ( at @xmath114 ) .",
    "this singularity dominates the fourier transform at large `` frequencies '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , large position space distances .",
    "that @xmath47 occurs at a subleading order in the small-@xmath38 expansion does not change this conclusion .    now consider point ( ii ) .",
    "observe that to find the small - distance behavior of the correlator we need its large - momentum behavior .",
    "yet , the latter is not obvious from the first several terms of the expansion around @xmath114 .",
    "indeed , a series around the origin describes a function only inside a circle up to the nearest singularity .",
    "a simple illustration is provided by a massive scalar field in four dimensions : the interaction has a finite range , @xmath115 , even though transforming the small-@xmath38 expansion of @xmath116^{-1}$ ] term - by - term one would get a series of contact terms @xmath117 .",
    "the `` nonperturbative effect '' @xmath118 is missed in this series . in our case , the rs 2 propagator is being expanded around its branch point and hence the radius of convergence of the series is zero .",
    "the large - momentum behavior of the propagator is instead given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flat_proca_brane ] ) , from which we explicitly get no contact terms .",
    "the position - space picture gives a simple prescription for describing the unparticle propagator in a generic realization .",
    "take the propagator to be of the form @xmath119 @xcite at large distances .",
    "this respects the conformal symmetry .",
    "now , soften somehow the short - distance core , for @xmath120 , to make the fourier transform possible .",
    "the resulting interaction at momentum scales @xmath121 will be dominated by `` contact '' terms and will possess all the other unparticle properties discussed in the introduction .",
    "it is curious to note that the behavior of the propagator at both low and high momenta is dictated by the short - distance part of the interaction .",
    "indeed , we have established that the pure cft interaction at long distances contribute subdominantly to low - energy scattering .",
    "we already encountered this while examining the spectral representation : the uv tail dominates the integral . remarkably , `` long distance physics '' and `` low energy physics '' are not the same .",
    "_ effective field theory view_. it is worth mentioning that the last point in no way contradicts the general principles of effective field theory .",
    "indeed , regardless of the scale at which the different parts of the interaction arise , at low energies the interaction is described by a series of effective operators @xmath122 , @xmath123 , ... , plus the piece @xmath124 that comes from the low - mass modes that can not be integrated out .",
    "for @xmath125 it then follows that the contact terms coming from uv dominate in scattering .",
    "notice that this expansion should be directly compared to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spectralintegralcontact ] ) and ( [ eq : longitudinal_branetobrane_expand_mink ] ) .",
    "the latter , in particular , fixes the relative coefficients of all the effective operators , as should happen in any concrete model realizing the unparticle scenario .",
    "_ on other realizations and generalizations_. in this paper , we have considered a vector field in the bulk and shown that it possesses all the properties of unparticles .",
    "the ads / cft conjecture is of course known to be more general , and we believe that our results generalize as well : bulk fields of other spins should also give unparticles of corresponding spin ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) .",
    "this rs 2/unparticle conjecture should be investigated further .",
    "other realizations of unparticles are certainly possible . even within the warped extra dimensions framework ,",
    "the uv regime can be different , as illustrated , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the lykken - randall @xcite scenario treated in @xcite . depending on the realization",
    ", the relative coefficients between the low - energy effective operators will be different , but the general results following from the effective field theory analysis must be preserved . in particular , the dominance of the contact interactions should persist , by simple power counting .",
    "we close with the following observation .",
    "phenomenologically , one may be interested to consider a broader class of hidden sector models with a continuous or quasi - continuous spectrum . even though the underlying theory may not be a strict cft",
    ", it may turn out to look approximately scale invariant in a range of energies accessible to a given experiment ( _ cf . _",
    "qcd , @xcite ) . in such a case",
    ", many of the features of unparticles discussed here could still apply .",
    "this particularly refers to the properties following from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectralintegralcontact ] ) . whenever the spectral integral is uv - dominated",
    ", the `` contact terms '' will dominate in sm - sm scattering processes .",
    "the unparticle phase space and the phase of the cft piece of the propagator are also derived from the spectral representation and , so long as the latter looks `` sufficiently conformal '' in the range of energies of the experiment , would follow their unparticle forms . in this sense , they are more robust features than the unitarity bounds , which , as we saw , could be avoided by relaxing strict conformal symmetry , or considering gauge - variant operators .",
    "in summary , at energies much below the ads curvature , the rs 2 model possesses the known properties of unparticle physics .",
    "this includes both the cft features  the unitarity bounds and the tensor structure  and the features originating from the breaking of the cft in the uv , particularly the dominant `` contact '' terms .",
    "we explicitly see , as observed in @xcite , that the unparticle physics scenario is not only about a scale invariant theory ",
    "the cft breaking and coupling to the sm in the uv are its essential ingredients .",
    "the uv regularization of the cft by the flat five - dimensional space is different from the banks - zaks scenario envisioned in the original work @xcite , nevertheless it is sufficient to control the divergences of the spectral function and guarantee cancellations between the `` contact '' terms and the cft parts . at the same time , in the infrared , the cft is preserved , ensuring that the cft tensor structure and unitarity bounds are preserved .",
    "the utility of having a concrete , treatable realization of the unparticle scenario is demonstrated by the ease with which the known properties of unparticles are obtained here , and , moreover , extended to strong coupling .",
    "we hope that further applications of rs - like models can shine light on other theoretical issues of unparticle physics .",
    "additionally , phenomenology of unparticles continues to be an active area of research ( see , _ _",
    "e.g. , @xcite for a list of references ) .",
    "it is hoped that having the rs 2 realization will lead to further progress in this area as well .",
