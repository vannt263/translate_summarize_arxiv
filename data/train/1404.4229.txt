    "understanding the origins of single - spin asymmetries in high - energy processes is one of the main goals in qcd and hadronic physics  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal target spin asymmetry ( ltsa )  @xcite , as the first unambiguous single - spin phenomenon measured in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , has attracted a lot of theoretical attentions .",
    "experimentally , the ltsa is usually measured by using the target longitudinally polarized with respect to the incoming beam direction , which makes the interpretation of the asymmetry more complicated .",
    "this is because in this case the measured asymmetry contains contributions from both the transverse and longitudinal polarization components with respect to the virtual photon direction .",
    "the small but non - vanishing transverse polarization component , although suppressed by a factor @xmath6 compared to the longitudinal component , can contribute to the measured asymmetry through the collins  @xcite or sivers  @xcite effects , which are leading - twist observables .",
    "this feature , especially the former one , has been considered in several estimates  @xcite in terms of the transversity distribution and collins fragmentation functions  @xcite . apart from this ,",
    "there are also competing contributions that originate from the various convolutions of the twist-3 quark distribution functions or fragmentation functions with their twist-2 counterparts , due to the presence of the large longitudinal component .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry from those contributions , usually denoted by @xmath2 where @xmath7 is the azimuthal angle of the final hadron around the photon direction , is the purely twist-3 results , compared to the leading - twist ones .    in this paper , we will study the ltsa based upon the contributions from the subleading - twist effects .",
    "although those effects encode important twist-3 dynamics of the nucleon , they are barely studied in phenomenology and have not been fully considered in the previous theoretical analyses . at the twist-3 level , there are four individual contributions  @xcite that can give rise to the ltsa .",
    "two of them are from the the twist-3 fragmentation functions , while another two are from the twist-3 distribution functions . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the effects of the twist-3 quark distributions , that is , the distributions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the former one is a t - odd transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution and can be viewed as the twist-3 analogy of the sivers function ; it generates the ltsa through the coupling with the unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath10 .",
    "the later one is a chiral - odd distribution , therefore its contribution to the ltsa involves another chiral - odd fragmentation function , the collins function @xmath11  @xcite . in our study",
    "we will consider both the @xmath12 term  @xcite and the @xmath13 term  @xcite .",
    "currently the knowledge on the twist-3 distributions is very limited . in order to quantitatively",
    "predict the ltsa in sidis contributed by the subleading - twist effect , we will employ the spectator - diquark models to calculate the tmd distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 valence quarks inside the proton .",
    "as the asymmetry we calculate , the @xmath2 , corresponds to the case in which the nucleon is longitudinally polarized with respect to the virtual photon momentum , it is not easy to compare our result directly with the experiments in which the longitudinal spin of the target is originally along the beam direction",
    ". fortunately , there are available data @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 production from the hermes collaboration , which are extracted from the original data by subtracting the contributions from the sivers effect and the collins effect , using the data on the transversely polarized target  @xcite .",
    "the extraction is valid up to corrections of order @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the polar angle between the incoming beam direction and the virtual photon direction .",
    "new data on @xmath2 are also coming from the clas at the jefferson lab .",
    "these make the comparison between theoretical estimates and experimental measurements possible .",
    "the remained content of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we calculate the twist-3 tmd distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the spectator - diquark models , and we will use two different models to obtain two sets of tmd distributions for comparison . in section iii , we estimate the ltsa contributed by the @xmath12 and @xmath13 terms at the hermes kinematics , and compare the results with the hermes data",
    ". we will also give the prediction on the ltsa at clas and compass .",
    "we summarize the paper in section iv .",
