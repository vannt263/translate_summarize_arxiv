    "* ) observations allowed for more precise mapping of cloud structure .",
    "some clumps originally found on emission maps were further decomposed and more compact ( typical sizes @xmath17  pc ) , very dense ( @xmath18  @xmath4 ) and probably collapsing clumps were delineated .",
    "some authors call such objects ` dense cores ' ; hereafter , we label them simply _",
    "cores_.    it is suggested that cores eventually form stars @xcite and thus the study of their mass function ( cmf ) will enable a better understanding of the physical origin of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and its possible variations .",

    "this general picture was confirmed from submillimeter continuum studies of mc complexes at kpc - scale distances . using @xmath30 and @xmath31 scuba maps ,",
    "reid & wilson derived 2 power - law clmfs for two massive star - forming regions .",
    "for ngc7538 , they obtained @xmath32 and @xmath33 while the variations of the high - mass slope seem to be more sensitive to the wavelength and close to the salpeter value : @xmath34 @xcite . for m17 , the characteristic mass turned out to be an order of magnitude less ( @xmath35 ) , the intermediate mass slopes are positive ( @xmath36 ) and the high - mass ones are about the value for co clumps @xmath37 @xcite . extending further their study to 11 low- and high - mass star - forming regions ,",

    "( the molecular - line study of rosette mc with its high @xmath20 is the only exception . )",

    "it seems that the single power - law observational clmfs of slope @xmath242 derived from molecular - line studies in 1990s @xcite have been products of a combination between intermediate- and a few bins from high - mass clmf . on the other hand ,",

    "the dust extinction mapping of taurus , orion a and orion b by lal10 enabled us to make a link between the predicted general cloud structure and the clmf .",

    "<S> the statistical approach for derivation of the clump mass function ( clmf ) developed by donkov , veltchev & klessen is put to observational test through comparison with mass distributions of clumps from molecular emission and dust continuum maps of galactic cloud complexes , obtained by various authors . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate gravitational boundedness of the dominant clump population , with or without taking into account the contribution of their thermal and magnetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the clmf can be presented by combination of two power - law functions separated by a characteristic mass from about ten to hundreds solar masses . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the intermediate - mass clmf is shallow and nearly constant ( @xmath0 ) while the high - mass part is fitted by models that imply gravitationally unstable clumps and exhibit slopes in a broader range ( @xmath1 ) , centered at the value of the stellar initial mass function ( @xmath2 ) .    </S>",
