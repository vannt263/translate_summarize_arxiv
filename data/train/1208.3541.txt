    "density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite within the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme  @xcite is the most widely used method for electronic - structure calculations in atomic , molecular and solid - state systems . with the usual approximate density functionals , such as generalized - gradient approximations ( gga ) and hybrid approximations mixing in a fraction of hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange ,",
    "dft ks generally gives good results for situations in which the so - called dynamic electron correlation dominates the total correlation energy , but it can yield severe errors for systems with strong static correlation , i.e. with partially filled near - degenerate orbitals ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "it has been argued that the gga exchange density functionals actually mimic some static correlation through their self - interaction error , though in an imperfect manner ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "there is often indeed a partial cancellation of errors between the self - interaction error which tends to give too low an energy and the neglect of static correlation which gives too high an energy ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "hybrid approximations have a smaller self - interaction error and are thus often worse than pure density functionals for describing systems with static correlation ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to include explicit static correlation in density - functional theory . artificially breaking ( space and spin ) symmetry by unrestricted ks calculations",
    "is the simplest approach to simulate static correlation ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , and it often leads to reasonable potential energy surfaces but wrong spin densities .",
    "another possible approach consists in replacing the single ks determinant by an ensemble of determinants or , equivalently , using fractional occupation numbers for the orbitals  @xcite , but a successful and general method based on this idea is still lacking .",
    "configuration - interaction schemes have also been proposed in which modified hamiltonian matrix elements include information from dft  @xcite .",
    "a lot of approaches consist in adding to the energy of a partially correlated wave function calculation , including near - degenerate configuration state functions coupled by the full coulombic electron - electron interaction , an energy density functional describing the missing correlation effects  @xcite . in these last approaches",
    ", one must use a density functional which depends on the size of the multiconfigurational expansion , in order to avoid double counting of correlation between the wave function part of the calculation and the density functional .",
    "finally , to avoiding any double counting of correlation from the beginning , it has been proposed to decompose the coulombic electron - electron interaction into long - range and short - range components , the long - range part being treated by a method capable of describing static correlation and the short - range part being described by a density functional approximation .",
    "the methods that have been used for the long - range part are : configuration interaction  @xcite , multiconfigurational self - consistent field ( mcscf )  @xcite , multireference perturbation theory  @xcite , constrained - pairing mean - field theory  @xcite , and density - matrix functional theory  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the possibility to combine mcscf and dft based on a simple linear decomposition of the coulombic electron - electron interaction , in the spirit of the usual hybrid approximations , and similarly to what was recently done for constructing theoretically justified double - hybrid approximations  @xcite .",
    "this approach gives a straightforward multiconfigurational extension of the standard hybrid approximations , and aims at improving their description of static correlation .",
    "after deriving this multiconfigurational hybrid density - functional theory , we test this approach on situations with strong static correlation effects , namely the cycloaddition reactions of ozone with ethylene or acetylene and the dissociation of diatomic molecules , and we compare with other methods , in particular the range - separated multiconfigurational hybrid method of ref .  .",

    ", we must use approximations , and the energy does depend on @xmath0 , which can then be considered as an empirical parameter to be optimized .",
    "the present scheme has two advantages over the range - separated scheme : ( a ) only one list of two - electron coulomb integrals is needed and it is just multiplied by @xmath0 in the mcscf part and by @xmath29 in the complement hartree energy , whereas two lists of two - electron integrals are needed in the range - separated scheme for the long - range mcscf part and for the short - range complement hartree energy ; ( b ) no new exchange and correlation density functionals need in principle to be developed since all the existing approximations developed for the ks scheme can be reused with a simple scaling , whereas new short - range density - functional approximations must be developed in the range - separated scheme .",
    "equations  ( [ mcds1h ] ) and  ( [ mc1h ] ) can be seen as straightforward multiconfigurational extensions of the usual hybrid approximations .",
    "indeed , the expectation value of @xmath30 over the mcscf wave function @xmath2 not only introduces a fraction @xmath0 of exact exchange but also a fraction of exact static correlation .",
    "defined in the ideal limit of reference energy levels that are degenerate , the static correlation energy is linear with respect to the electron - electron interaction , and thus we can consider that the expectation value of @xmath30 introduces a linear fraction @xmath0 of static correlation .",
    "by contrast , the dynamic correlation energy starts at quadratic order in the electron - electron interaction , so that , for sufficiently small @xmath0 , it is justified to neglect it in the wave function expectation value . moreover , for sufficiently small @xmath0 , the weight @xmath31 is close to @xmath32 and thus eq .

    "includes a nearly complete approximate correlation energy functional , that is often thought of as correctly describing dynamic correlation . of course , if the multiconfigurational hybrid approximations of eq .",
    "( [ mcds1h ] ) or  ( [ mc1h ] ) are to be accurate , the fraction @xmath29 of static correlation energy not treated by mcscf must be accounted for by the density functional , possibly through a compensation with the self - interaction error of the scaled exchange functional @xmath33 $ ] .",

    ", with better short - range density - functional approximations ( in particular , we do not have a short - range version of the lyp correlation functional for comparison ) , the conclusion could be different . also , one should note that hybrid approaches combining perturbation theory with dft based on a linear decomposition of the interaction  @xcite do not have the advantages of the range - separated hybrid approaches for fast basis - size convergence and explicit inclusion of long - range van der waals interactions . for mcscf , however , basis set convergence is not so much an issue .",
