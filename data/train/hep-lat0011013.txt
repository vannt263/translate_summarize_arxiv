    "the temperature and density effects to the properties of hadrons are interesting and important for the early universe and for high energy physics .",
    "so far the temperature effect has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "but there are not so many results concerning the density effect .",
    "as is well known , there are difficulties with the simulation of a finite density system by the lattice qcd approach .",
    "the reason is that the fermionic determinant becomes complex and can not be considered as a part of the probability .",
    "if we factor out the phase of the determinant and put it into observables , it leads to oscillating contributions in quantum averages .",
    "this makes it hard to obtain reliable results .",
    "it has been also known that the naive quenched approximation leads to an essentially different world @xcite .    in spite of this difficult situation ,",
    "density effects to hadrons such as a mass - shift are very interesting and important subjects both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to circumvent this difficulty and they seem successful to a limited extent @xcite . another way is to study two - color qcd @xcite .",
    "also , a non - trivial quenched approximation can be defined @xcite by taking the simultaneous limit where the quark mass and the logarithm of the chemical potential both become infinite @xcite . as for the response to the chemical potential",
    ", only the baryon number susceptibility at zero baryon density has been studied , and an abrupt jump at the transition point has been reported @xcite .    in this paper , we examine the response to the chemical potential of the mass of hadrons at finite temperature and at zero baryon density in full su(3 ) qcd simulations@xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the lattice study at finite density is still difficult . in this situation ,",
    "an interesting possibility is to examine the response of physical quantities to the chemical potential at zero chemical potential .",
    "here we consider a hadronic correlator @xmath3 ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the hadron operator .",
    "suppose that this hadronic correlator is dominated by a single pole , then @xmath6 we take derivative with respect to chemical potential @xmath7 , @xmath8 in eq.([deri-1 ] ) , if the left hand side is measured as a function of @xmath9 , the linear term gives the chemical potential response of the hadron mass , while the constant term gives the response of the coupling .",
    "the next problem is to get the derivative of the correlator . for this purpose , we go back to the definition of the hadronic correlator .    @xmath10 \\mbox{tr}\\,(m(n;0)\\gamma m(0;n)\\gamma^{\\dagger})\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox{det}(d)\\exp(-s_g ) \\label{deri0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 \\mbox{det}(d)\\exp(-s_g)$ ] and @xmath12 .",
    "then , using the formulae @xmath13 and @xmath14 we get @xmath15 where the short hand notations @xmath16 and @xmath17 \\mbox{det}(d)\\exp(-s_g ) y\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are used . here",
    "we calculate the first and second terms of the right hand side of eq.([deri2 ] ) and ignore the other terms .",
    "@xmath18 is pure imaginary and its average value , i.e. @xmath19 will be zero@xcite . if @xmath20 is real , the third term does not contribute as real and we may neglect it . for degenerate quarks",
    ", @xmath20 is real .",
    "although we consider here non - degenerate systems for which @xmath20 is not real , we assume that the contribution from the third term is small and drop it in this study .",
    "we introduce two independent chemical potentials , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for two different quarks ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we introduce convenient definitions of the chemical potential , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and define the following derivatives with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath26 is usual chemical potential corresponding to baryon number . in this study",
    "we consider the response with respect to @xmath26 .    in the case of the staggered fermion formalism , the derivative of the fermion operator is @xmath30 . \\label{deri3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath31 , we can evaluate eqs .",
    "( [ deri0 ] ) and ( [ deri2 ] ) by usual techniques of lattice qcd simulation .",
    "here we present our preliminary result for @xmath2 .",
    "lattice parameters are as follows :    * * lattice size * : + @xmath32 , with 16 for @xmath9 direction , 4 for the temperature direction . *",
    "* quarks * : + @xmath33=0.25 and @xmath34=0.025 for @xmath35=5.26 , and @xmath33=0.25 and @xmath34=0.0125 for @xmath35=5.33 .",
    "dynamical k - s fermions with @xmath1 are the light quarks ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the meson operator , @xmath36 , is made of the two different quarks .",
    "* * temperature * : + @xmath37 for @xmath38 ( confinement ) , and + @xmath39 for @xmath40 ( deconfinement ) . *",
    "* statistics * : + 40 - 90 configurations for each parameter .      the results for the @xmath42 in eq.([deri-1a ] ) are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "fig.1 is for @xmath37 which corresponds to the confinement phase and fig.2 is for @xmath39 which corresponds to the deconfinement phase .     in the confinement phase ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , where @xmath3 is the hadron propagator along the @xmath9 direction . @xmath43 and @xmath44    as is stated above , the coefficient of the linear term in @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "although this is preliminary and the statistics are small , we can see that @xmath2 is negative in the confinement phase and @xmath2 is positive in the deconfinement phase .     in the deconfinement phase ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , where @xmath3 is the hadron propagator along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath46",
    "one of our masses , @xmath33 , is in the region of the strange quark . if the behaviors observed in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are also seen in the charm quark mass region , then the mass of the heavy - light meson , @xmath48 , might decrease at very small chemical potential just below the deconfinement temperature . then the mass of @xmath49 system might be lower than the mass of the @xmath50 meson , and a new decay mode @xmath51 will open .",
    "if this happens in , for example , ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , @xmath50 mesons produced by this collision will decay as @xmath52 and eventually the amount of @xmath47 produced through @xmath53 channel will decrease .",
    "this means that @xmath47 suppression might occur even in the confinement phase as suggested by hayashigaki@xcite .",
    "the results of this paper are very preliminary and qualitative and should be checked in the near future . however",
    "a model calculation based on njl model@xcite suggests the same tendency .",
