    "counterions in aqueous solution play a crucial role in the self - assembly of colloids and polymers , cell signaling , microfluidics and fuel cells . in recent years , there has been a considerable body of experimental and theoretical work aimed at understanding the rich and complex phenomenology of ions in aqueous solution and their interactions with charged interfaces @xcite .",
    "a representative example of this phenomenology is charge inversion ( ci ) , where interfacial charges attract counterions in excess of their own nominal charge , thus leading to an interface whose effective surface charge is reversed .",
    "the first simulation study that showed evidence of ci with divalent ions was conducted by torrie and valleau @xcite , in which the authors used a primitive hard sphere model for the ions and a continuum solvent model with a dielectric constant .",
    "still the origins of ci are poorly understood , as highlighted in a recent review article by lyklema @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is unclear to what extent existing theories explain the observed ci reported in experimental work .",
    "a recent experiment has provided a detailed investigation of ci by multivalent counterions from an analysis of streaming currents , the electric currents resulting from applying a pressure gradient along a charged nanofluidic channel containing electrolyte solutions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) @xcite .",
    "the precision and accuracy of such experiments provide a perfect arena to test existing theoretical models of ci in particular and the more general problem of ion distributions .        .",
    "different theories for ci have been proposed over the years . in ref .  @xcite it was proposed that ci arises from the gain in correlation energy brought about by lateral correlations ( lc ) among mobile counterions . for divalent ions in silica nanochannels ,",
    "this theory would predict ci at @xmath0 mm may be too small for this theory to rigorously apply @xcite.]-an order of magnitude lower than what is observed experimentally @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out that the intrinsic discreteness of interfacial charges may give rise to ci by transverse correlations ( tc ) , that is , correlations between counterions and interfacial charges . in particular , it has been shown that binding constants of divalent ions to oxygen atoms are typically of the order of @xmath1   m@xmath2 , thus implying ci at @xmath3  m. numerical simulations with primitive models , where the solvent is considered implicitly as a medium of dielectric constant @xmath4 , have been reported@xcite , and show general agreement with lc theories , thus implying lower than the @xmath5  mm observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "other theoretical work has focused in the computation of mobilities @xcite as a function of @xmath6-potential , but as reviewed in @xcite , the interpretation of experimentally determined @xmath6-potentials is not entirely clear .",
    "a clear understanding of the ci phenomenon may therefore require approaches where water is considered explicitly and the interface is modelled realistically , with more structure than a uniform surface charge . as discussed in @xcite , these effects are expected to play a critical role .    in this paper , we investigate the origin of ci with atomic resolution by using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of a charged silica interface in contact with an aqueous solution with divalent ions .",
    "this study is further motivated by recent interest in understanding the structure of pure water in contact with silica @xcite , as some evidence suggests the presence of highly ordered interfacial water structures .",
    "it has not been investigated , however , how divalent ions , which have a very cohesive hydration sheath , may modify interfacial water .",
    "in addition , our results have implications in the field of microfluidics because silica is the most common material used in nano- and microfluidic devices@xcite , including the recently synthesized nanoporous functionalized silica thin films @xcite that are being investigated as desalination membranes @xcite .",
    "we consider the system schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] where an interface of amorphous silica is in contact with an aqueous solution . throughout this letter",
    ", we will consider ionic strengths such that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the debye length and @xmath9 is the separation between the two silica interfaces ( see fig.[fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "we can therefore neglect the interactions between the two silica interfaces and perform our md simulations on a single interface .",
    "amorphous silica was generated according to a previously reported procedure @xcite .",
    "we start with a bulk @xmath10-quartz crystalline substrate that is heated to high temperature ( @xmath11  k ) and quenched to @xmath12  k. we then generate two free surfaces in the z - dimension and further anneal the substrate until the density of bond defects on each interface is representative of the experimentally observed density on amorphous silica ( @xmath13-@xmath14/nm@xmath15)@xcite . the silicon and oxygen defects are terminated with -oh and -h respectively .",
    "the silica interface is given a negative charge by randomly selecting -oh groups and removing the corresponding proton , leaving a net surface charge of @xmath16  @xmath17 , in line with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the amorphous silica had a total area of @xmath18 @xmath15 in contact with an aqueous solution containing water ( @xmath19 water molecules ) and divalent ions .",
    "water was modelled explicitly by using the tip3p model @xcite , the two cations used in the simulation , ( ca@xmath20 , mg@xmath20 ) , were modeled with aqvist s parameters @xcite and cl@xmath21 with the opls forcefield @xcite .",
    "the silica was modeled by the opls force field described in @xcite .",
    "the simulations reported in this article were performed with the lammps molecular dynamics code @xcite . in all simulations ,",
    "the temperature is fixed at t@xmath22 k and controlled with a nose - hoover thermostat and a time constant of 0.01  fs@xmath2 .",
    "the shake algorithm @xcite was used to constrain the bond lengths and angles of the water molecule and the bond lengths of the oh bonds on the silica substrate surface .",
    "a 1  fs time step was used and the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction is cut off at 10   . a slab version of the particle - particle particle - mesh algorithm @xcite is used to compute long - range coulombic interactions . an average run lasted around 12 ns , with data being collected and analyzed over the last 8 ns .",
    "a typical run took 4608 node - hours per 12 ns simulation .",
    "charge ( blue circle ) and cl@xmath21 charge ( red square ) relative to the interfacial charge as a function of time for the different layers .",
    "layer 1 represents bound oxygens ( defined such that o - ca@xmath20 distance is less than 3  ) layer 2 is defined by the size of the hydrated divalent ions ( o - ca@xmath20 distance is within 3 and 6    )  and layer 3 is the last layer before bulk values are attained , with o - ca@xmath20 distance @xmath23   .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] for a schematic definition of the different layers ) .",
    "results are for 1.0 m concentrations.,width=3 ]            charge inversion in the mgcl@xmath24 systems is also obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_density_mg ] , where the charge density as a function of distance from the interface is shown . the data from the cacl@xmath24 systems are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_density_mg ] so that they can be compared to the mgcl@xmath24 systems . in both cases , there is marginal ci of nearly identical magnitude at a concentration of 0.5 m. then at a concentration of 1.0 m , both systems show significantly larger ci .",
    "these results for the mgcl@xmath24 systems show conclusive evidence for a stern layer consisting of mg@xmath20 ions ( first and second layers ) followed by an `` inverted '' ( negatively charged ) diffuse layer .    in mgcl@xmath24 solutions ,",
    "the number of divalent ions within the stern layer is similar as in cacl@xmath24 but its structure is quite different , as there are very few bound counterions .",
    "we raised the possibility that this may reflect that the stern layer may not be thermalized , and that longer simulations ( at least @xmath25 1  @xmath26s ) might reveal a structure more similar to the cacl@xmath24 case .",
    "we point out , however , that in ref .  @xcite it was concluded that binding constants of mg@xmath20 to oxygen atoms are generally small , a result attributed to the compactness of the mg@xmath20 hydration sheath . in any case , whether thermalized or not , our simulations show ci and , as apparent from the rdf in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] , correlations between mg@xmath20 and charged interfacial groups are shown to play a fundamental role .",
