    "constrained minimization problems for bending energies arise naturally in various applications . in biophysics for example",
    "the shape of the cell membranes is often modeled as ( local ) minimizer of an appropriate curvature energy , most notably of the helfrich ",
    "canham energy @xmath1 here @xmath2 is a smooth surface describing the shape of the cell , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mean and gaussian curvature of @xmath5 , and the spontaneous curvature @xmath6 and the bending moduli @xmath7 are given parameters . under appropriate constraints on the total surface area and on the enclosed volume local minimizers of such shape energies",
    "are in good agreement with typical shapes of cell membranes .    in this article",
    "we are interested in the minimization of bending energies under an additional confinement condition .",
    "this problem is motivated by the shape of inner organelles in a biological cell .",
    "these structures are confined to the inner volume of the cell . moreover , as the membrane contributes to their biological function , organelles often have large surface area ( see for example the typical shape of mitochondriae ) .",
    "we start here a mathematical analysis of a simple prototype of such constrained minimization problems : as curvature energy we consider the willmore functional and we choose as outer container the unit ball . to give a precise description of the problem",
    "let us introduce some notation : let @xmath8 be given and let @xmath9 be the unit ball in @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the class of smoothly embedded surfaces @xmath12 of sphere type with surface area @xmath13 .",
    "we associate to @xmath14 the outer unit normal field @xmath15 , denote by @xmath16 the principal curvatures of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath17 , and define the scalar mean curvature @xmath18 , the mean curvature vector @xmath19 , and the gauss curvature @xmath20 .    for @xmath21",
    "we then consider the willmore energy @xmath22 and the constrained minimization problem @xmath23 we are interested in the dependence of @xmath24 on the surface area @xmath25 , in particular for large values of @xmath25 .",
    "the infimum @xmath24 may not be attained , as limit points of minimal sequences need not to be embedded .",
    "therefore , we can not make use of the euler  lagrange equation .",
    "it is an interesting open problem to identify a class of ( generalized ) surfaces that comprises the closure of @xmath26 and in which the infimum of the willmore energy is attained .",
    "one possible candidate is the class of hutchinson varifolds that have a unique tangent plane in every point but possibly varying multiplicity .",
    "our main results are first a general lower bound @xmath27 and the optimality of this bound for @xmath28 with @xmath29 , and second a characterization of the behavior of @xmath30 as @xmath25 just exceeds the value @xmath31 . for @xmath28 the optimal value",
    "@xmath30 realizes the willmore energy of @xmath32 spheres and the varifold limit of a minimal sequence converges to the unit sphere with density @xmath32 .",
    "configurations at @xmath33 resemble @xmath32 unit spheres ( connected by catonoid like structures in order to have the topology of a sphere ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the behavior of @xmath30 as @xmath25 crosses @xmath31 is key for the understanding of the constrained minimization problem . as there are no surfaces that are @xmath0-close to the sphere with area above @xmath31 a change of behavior at this value can be expected . in fact , we prove a sharp increase in the optimal energy at @xmath31 : the difference in willmore energy @xmath34 behaves like the square root of the area difference @xmath35 .",
    "the proof of the corresponding lower bound is the most delicate step and uses rigidity estimates for nearly umbilical surfaces shown by de lellis and mller @xcite .    whereas our analysis does use the particular choice of the unit ball as the confinement condition we also gain some insight in the minimization problem for more general containers @xmath36 .",
    "in particular we obtain general upper and lower bounds that are linear in @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath37 a rescaling argument shows that @xmath38 for any @xmath39 . if on the other hand @xmath40 then @xmath41 for any @xmath42 , @xmath29 . in case of a convex container with @xmath0-boundary",
    "we expect that with growing surface area first the full space provided by the container will be used ( with a linear growth rate of the minimal willmore energy ) before a protrusion inside the container will be developed ( with a square root type increase in willmore energy ) . comparing the behavior of our constrained minimization problem with the shape of inner structures in cells we remark that our model rather supports formation of single protrusions that grow inside than the formation of multiple folds .",
    "this indicates that for a proper model of such structures more details have to be taken into account such as the dynamic process of fold formation or additional constraints on the enclosed volume of the inner structures .",
    "the minimization of the willmore functional under constraints has been studied in detail for rotationally symmetric surfaces , see @xcite for a review .",
    "general existence results without any symmetry assumptions were obtained by simon @xcite proving the existence of smooth minimizer for the willmore functional for tori in @xmath10 .",
    "this result was extended to surfaces with arbitrary prescribed genus by bauer and kuwert @xcite .",
    "recently schygulla @xcite showed the existence of smooth minimizers of the willmore functional for sphere - type surfaces with prescribed isoperimetric ratio .",
    "one estimate that was shown in @xcite and has been refined in @xcite is the following relation between willmore functional , surface area , and ( external ) diameter @xmath43 , @xmath44 for our purposes however , this estimates is not very helpful as it degenerates with increasing surface area .",
    "an alternative approach for minimizing the willmore energy is to employ a gradient flow . for the willmore flow",
    "simonett @xcite and kuwert and schtzle @xcite have proved existence and convergence results . however , as we need to satisfy constraints on area and confinement such results are not directly applicable to our problem .",
    "a closely related confinement problem has been studied by numerical simulations in @xcite . for a phase field approach to the minimization of the willmore energy under a confinement and connectedness constraint",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we will first prove a general lower bound for surfaces in the unit ball by exploiting the classical gauss integration by parts formula on manifolds .",
    "as remarked above , limit points of minimizing sequences for our constrained minimization problem may leave the class @xmath26 . by allard s compactness theorem @xcite such limit points",
    "at least belong to the class of integral 2-varifolds with weak mean curvature in @xmath45 , see @xcite for the relevant definitions ( note that we identify an integral 2-varifold with its associated weight measure on @xmath10 ) .",
