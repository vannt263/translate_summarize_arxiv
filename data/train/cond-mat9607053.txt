    "this is justified in the sense that the infinite zero point energy is unobservable . however , the change in zero point energy caused by the external constraint is finite and observable .",
    "so , according to casimir s  @xcite idea , the physical vacuum energy can be defined as the difference between the zero point energy corresponding to the vacuum configurations with constraints and the one corresponding to the free vacuum configurations .",
    "this definitions must be supplemented in general with a regularisation prescription in order to obtain a finite final convergent expression .",

    "such a procedure can be justified on physical grounds if one imagines that the magnetic field is turned on adiabatically  @xcite . in the appendix",
    "a and b , we show that this mode matching scheme is the correct regularisation procedure .",
    "more specifically , in appendix a we compare this scheme with another scheme which looks apparently correct and in appendix b we justify this mode matching scheme from the field theoretic point of view .    counting the modes",
    "upto the l - th landau level we find @xmath45 similarly , for the momentum cutoff upto @xmath43 we get the modes without the magnetic field as @xmath46 equating these gives us @xmath47 now , the free energy in absence of the magnetic field depends on magnetic field through the momentum cutoff and is given by @xmath48 the difference between the two free energies is given by @xmath49 we define @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . numerically evaluating these sums one can show that for finite @xmath40 , @xmath53 the difference between two large quantities is positive . as the cutoff @xmath40 goes to infinity , @xmath53 becomes the difference between two infinities . in this limit",

    "we want to discuss the behaviour of the leading term of the free energy in the massless limit and its consequences .",
    "it is easy to see from the zero temperature free energy that the magnetisation in the zero mass limit is given by @xmath75 so , the susceptibility in this zero mass limit is given by @xmath76 which diverges  @xcite as @xmath18 goes to zero .",
    "this divergence of the susceptibility is reminiscent of the fact that the free energy @xmath77 .",
    "this variation of the free energy in the massless limit can also be understood from dimensional arguments as follows .",

    "however , the dimension of @xmath18 is @xmath80^{-2}$ ] .",
    "so , the massless limit restricts the free energy density variation with magnetic field @xmath18 to @xmath81 only .",
    "this feature of the susceptibility has already been noticed in the magnetised pair bose gas  @xcite .",
    "this divergence of the susceptibility can be compared with that of ideal charged bose gas at the condensation point  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is defined by @xmath82 where @xmath18 is the applied field ; what is actually computed , however , is a quantity @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the  acting \" field .",
    "the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath85 requires special attention ; in fact if the  acting \" field is identified with the average microscopic field then we have for this case @xmath86 this equation immediately gives a relation between @xmath87 and @xmath83 as @xmath88 this shows that on approaching @xmath89 limit , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 so that the permeability tends to zero .",
    "so , in this case the external field will be totally expelled .",
    "this happens because of large number of virtual particle and antiparticle produced in the ground state so that the overall diamagnetism of the system is high enough to totally expel the external field . that the magnetisation is non - analytic in the limit @xmath89 is the actual signature of a phase transition as a function of external field strength .",
    "note that this behaviour is equivalent to the behaviour of the free energy in strong magnetic field limit .",
    "this can be understood the way @xmath4 and @xmath18 appears in @xmath92 which is the only energy scale in the problem .",
    "hence , one should expect the same behaviour as @xmath93 or @xmath94 because in both situations higher landau levels become less and less occupied .",
    "in fact in this situation one can construct the theory in the lowest landau level .",
    "+    another interesting point is that there exists a critical magnetic field below which magnetic field will be totally expelled .",

    "the final result can be understood easily from the dispersion relation ( energy spectrum ) for ( 3 + 1 ) case which is given by @xmath109    thus , we get the free energy of charged scalar fields in 3d in presence of a constant homogeneous external magnetic field as    @xmath110   \\label{sq }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above equation ( [ sq ] ) we notice that the zero point free energy is given by @xmath111\\label{dh}\\ ] ] we regularise this free energy by the prescription given in  @xcite which was used in case of qed in an external magnetic field . in principle , one can use the prescription through a novel mode matching already developed for ( 2 + 1 ) dimension to regularise this free energy .",
    "but we use this regularisation scheme to compute quantitative evaluation of the regularised free energy in two interesting limits in the zero temperature case . as it is clear from ( 2 + 1 ) dimension case that we can not evalute the response function quantatively that s why we choose this scheme for that reason .",

    "a careful reader will immediately notice that this scheme will not work in ( 2 + 1 ) dimension .",
    "this shows the important role played by the @xmath138 integral . in the next two sections we consider two interesting limits of the free energy difference .",
    "+      at small magnetic field ( @xmath139 being very small ) we can approximate the free energy difference upto the leading factor in @xmath140 as @xmath141 thus the free energy difference at small magnetic field limit goes as @xmath131 .",

    "this universal inequality follows from basic principles and does not depend on the details of the interaction .",
    "the effective potential @xmath207 is gauge invariant .",
    "what we have done is that we have suitably redefined the measure of the integral through the inclusion of self - interaction .",
    "thus now , the bare measure has been changed to so called  dressed \" measure .",
    "this has the advantage that the effects of self - interaction and mutual interaction have been separated .",
    "also in field theory one would also require that the interaction @xmath207 be renormalizable . in @xmath215 dimensions",
    "this would restrict the interaction @xmath216 only . from simple power counting",
    ", one can notice easily that the required value of @xmath4 is @xmath217 . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "where a natural cutoff exists , higher order powers of @xmath218 may also be present .",
    "+ under normal conditions @xmath219 we expect the self interaction to merely affect the particle s mass .",
    "this is the same concept one uses in quasiparticle picture of landau fermi liquid theory  @xcite .",
    "the effect of all the interactions can be put in the definition of the effective mass of the quasi particles .",
    "therefore , the error committed would be small if we were to ignore the self - interactions while keeping each mass at a fixed observalble value .",
    "hence , we drop the superscript  dress \" and work with the ordinary wiener measure .",
    "+ notice that the bare mass enters the wiener measure .",
    "however , in the expression of the @xmath197 neither refers to nor uses the bare mass ; it never enters the interaction of the scalar particle with the electromagnetic field . on the otherhand ,",
    "it is important to realize that the bare mass @xmath4 differs from the physical or  effective \" mass @xmath220 .",
    "the differnece is induced by the interaction . adjusting the bare mass so as to gurantee that @xmath220 agrees with the observed mass of the particle constitutes the central issue of the renormalization program .",
    "it is generally believed that this issue ought to be resolved outside the perturbation theory . in this paper we do not attempt to answer these questions .",
    "+ in the interacting case it turns out that the partition function and hence the free energy can not be evaluated in closed form but still one can show the diamagnetism of charged scalar fields .",
    "this shows that diamgnetism of charged scalar fields is _ universal _",
    "i.e. robust in the sense that it is true for all dimensions and independent of the interaction between the scalar fields .",
    "one more comment regarding the meaning of universal behaviour of this system towards an external magnetic field .",
    "the proof of the diamagnetic inequality in the interacting case does not assume the form of the vector potential .",
    "thus , in that sense the theory is true whether the applied magnetic field is homogeneous or inhomogeneous .",
    "the word _ universality _ also reflects this fact that the behaviour of the system towards the magnetic field is independent of the nature of an applied magnetic field .",
    "we would like to emphasize one point regarding our theory which is as follows .",
    "if a phase transition takes place changing the drastic nature of the system , then of course our theory fails .",
    "as long as a phase transition does not take place that alters the bosonic behaviour , this theory can predict the response of the system in an external magnetic field as diamagnetic .",
    "it is evident from the previous sections that though the results obtained are quite general and important from the theoretical point of view but fail to connect directly with the experiment .",
    "what we have shown is basically the nature of the response of a system under an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , though the results are of interesting one but fails to compute explicitly the susceptibility as a function of magnetic field , mass and temperature .",
    "only in zero temperature case we have been able to compute the susceptibility in two limits .",
    "however , one can resort to perturbation method to compute approximately the response of the system in case of finite temperature . in this section",
    "we would like to discuss the possible situations which could be well - connected with the theory presented . from an experimental point of view one",
    "is more interested in the quantitative variation of the susceptibility with the temperature .",
    "therefore , in this section we will mainly address the temperature variation of the diamagnetic susceptibility assuming an effective landau - ginzburg free energy functional apart from giving some illustration of spinless bose systems .",
    "notice that the order parameter in landau - ginzburg model is a scalar one which has a characteristic @xmath221 symmetry .",
    "only the mass parameter in landau - ginzburg model has a different meaning in contrast to the theory presented here .",
    "+ one obvious example spinless bose systems in the laboratory is the cooper pair formation in superconductors which shows perfect diamagnetism ( known as the meissner  @xcite effect ) below the critical temperature .",
    "cooper pairs also exist in neutron stars  @xcite where the magnetic field is very high compared to any laboratory field .",
    "of course , the operators which create and destroy cooper pairs are not strictly bose operators , so this is only an analogy .",
    "in fact one can also calculate the diamagnetic susceptibility of the cooper pairs above the critical temperature , more specifically the temperature variation of the susceptibility .",
    "the diamagnetic susceptibility above the critical temperature has been observed recently in high-@xmath222 compounds  @xcite . in literature",
    "there exists a model  @xcite which does predict that above the critical temperature all or at any rate some of the carriers are bosons . here",
    ", of course , as has been pointed out  @xcite that the definition of the  critical temperature \" bears a different meaning in contrast to usual one .",
    "the  critical temperature \" in that context refers to the temperature at which the gas of bosons become wholely _ non - degenerate_. however , in the following we do not address all these issues regarding the mechanism of formation of bosons .",
    "+ with the usual landau - ginzburg effective field theory  @xcite it turns out that the diamagnetic susceptibility in @xmath223 dimension @xmath224 . without going much details into this calculation  @xcite ,",
    "the above peculiar variation of the susceptibility with temperature can be explained as follows . following the argument given for 3d  @xcite",
    ", we notice that above @xmath222 , droplet of cooper pairs will grow and decay as a result of thermodynamic fluctuations .",
    "their mean radius is approximately equal to @xmath225 which is the coherence length of the cooper pairs and phenomenologically the simplest variation of this coherence length is taken as @xmath226 .",
    "the  mass parameter \" in this theory is inversely proportional to this coherence length .",
    "therefore , the amount of energy required to produce a droplet is given by @xmath227 here @xmath228 is the density of the cooper pairs in the framework of phenomenological landau - ginzburg free energy functional",
    ". this energy must be equal to the thermal energy @xmath229 and hence @xmath230 now consider the expression for the diamagnetic susceptibility of atoms in scaled form as @xmath231 in otherwords for a general variation of the coherence length @xmath232 the susceptibility variation turns out as @xmath233 .",
    "however , as it is evident for dimension @xmath234 the above formula does not make any sense ; but this formula of course correctly reproduces the expected temperature variations for 2d and 3d .",
    "in fact , in 3d the exponent of the susceptibility ( @xmath235 ) has been observed in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "notice that inspite of the strong correlation among the cooper pairs in the system the pairs behave as if they are non - interacting .",
    "thus , within this simple landau - ginzburg approach one can give a strong hint towards the role of dimensionality of the system in high-@xmath222 material .",
    "+ it has been shown explicitly by j. daicic et .",
    "@xcite that the magnetised pair bose systems are relativistic superconductors .",
    "these systems are not covered by previous analysis  @xcite which apply to non - relativistic quantum mechanical systems .",
    "pions would be suitable candidates for application of this theory with @xmath236 and @xmath237 regarded as the particles and antiparticles .",
    "the choice is also motivated by the fact that these pions are massive ( @xmath238 mev ) , obey bose - einstein statistics and that they possess no spin .",
    "it is also well known that hard core bosons  @xcite in any dimension on any lattice show a preference for zero flux .",
    "the response of a system to an electric field is completely different from its response to a magnetic field .",
    "the basic difference between the responses of a system on application of an electric field or a magnetic field lies in the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the lagrangian of a system in the presence of an electric field can be written as @xmath239 where @xmath240 for statistical mechanics to make sense , the hamiltonian @xmath241 must be independent of time .",
    "then it follows that @xmath242\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + the electric field appears in the hamiltonian through the linear vector potential @xmath243 term .",
    "now , from finite temperature second order perturbation  @xcite theory , one can show easily that the free energy of the system always decreases with the electric field .",
    "hence , the dielectric susceptibility is always positive in thermal equilibrium . + but in the case of a magnetic field the hamiltonian contains both linear and quadratic terms in @xmath35 .",
    "the net effect of an applied magnetic field is not _ a priori _ clear .",
    "however , as our analysis makes clear , for charged scalar field theories the net effect is always diamagnetic . + in case of spinless bosons , there is no zeeman term coupled with a magnetic field and hence the system consisting of spinless bosons always has higher energy in a magnetic field than without the magnetic field .",
    "it has been already pointed  @xcite out that there is no corresponding theorem for fermions .",
    "so , in case of fermions having spin the general tendency is to show paramagnetism  @xcite .",
    "+ before we end we would like to comment on a recent work in the literature @xcite on ultrarelativistic hot scalar plasma",
    ". the results of their perturbative treatment are consistent with our results .",
    "in contrast , as we have already pointed out that our treatment is a non - perturbative one .",
    "since any non - perturbative treatment is always welcome in field theory we thought it would be interesting to present these results and arguments . besides we have been able to show the renormalisation of the free energy .",
    "these regularisation schemes help one to understand various interesting renormalization of the quantity involved ( in this case charge ) and a proper justification of the scaling functions discussed in the paper .",
    "+ in summary , we have shown exactly , that charged scalar fields in ( 2 + 1 ) and ( 3 + 1 ) dimension at all temperatures are diamagnetic .",

    "this scheme can be thought of as relating @xmath40 and @xmath43 by the criterion that the maximum energy of the two systems should be matched .",
    "the matching of the energy cutoff gives the relation between the momentum cut off @xmath43 and the landau level @xmath40 as @xmath248 this immediately suggests that @xmath249 note that this relation is different from the mode matching relation([mode1 ] ) we used previously for the charged scalar field theory .",

    "we support this statement through both numerical as well as analytical calculations . + below",
    "we present numerically a comparison between the two schemes .",
    "the values of @xmath250 ( scheme due to anonymous ) and @xmath251 ( used in the paper ) are tabulated for @xmath252 , @xmath253 and for various values of the cutoff @xmath40 .",
    "+    ccc different values of cutoffs(@xmath40 ) &  @xmath250 &  @xmath254 + l=10 &  6.774 &  0.2157 + l=100 &  20.308 &  0.2325 + l=1000 &  63.507 &  0.2382 + l=10000 &  200.248 &  0.2400 + l=50000 &  447.457 &  0.2404 + l=80000 &  565.929 &  0.2405 + l=100000 &  632.698 &  0.241 +     + from this table it is easy to see that our method gives a finite convergent , cutoff independent answers while the other method gives cutoff dependent , divergent answers for the free energy . in fact",
    "one can show analytically in this case that @xmath128 diverges with the cutoff as @xmath255 .",
    "this unphysical and meaningless answer is due to the comparision of systems with different number of degrees of freedom .",
    "note that in our analysis @xmath128 converges as @xmath256 .",
    "hence , the scheme due to matching of highest energy is therefore clearly unphysical .",
    "however , as already discussed our scheme can be justified physically from the adiabtically turning on the magnetic field .",
    "then the energy of each mode is affected by the magnetic field .",
    "comparing systems with the same number of modes is the logically and physically correct procedure .",
    "what the other method does is that it compares the systems with different degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , regularisation scheme based on energy cutoff does not give a renormalisable answer .",
    "also notice that phase space is invariant in any lorentz frame while the energy is not .",
    "we present below analytical work to show that in our case @xmath257 varies with @xmath256 and as @xmath258 , it does converge while the other case it diverges as @xmath255 in the same limit as indicated above .",
    "since the ultimate aim is to take the cutoff to infinity let us calculate the behaviour of the leading term in free enrgy difference as a function of cutoff .",
    "the difference between the free energy ( using the two regularisation schemes ) is given by @xmath259\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now defining a dimensionless small parameter @xmath260 ( which is reasonable in large cutoff @xmath40 and in strong magnetic field ) it is easy to write the above difference as @xmath261 this is consistent with the numerical results presented in the above table .",
    "another way of qualitatively understanding the above divergence is the following . in a strong magnetic field limit all the higher landau levels are far away and one is interested only in the lowest landau level . now in this situation if one countes the energy states and matches with the free case , then there will be leading order diveregnce with the cutoff due to mismatch of number of degrees of freedom . thus we notice that though the regularisation scheme provides a finite positive free energy differenece , it fails to give a renormalised difference .",
    "hence this scheme should not be considered as a correct and physical regularisation prescription .",
    "in this appendix we want to show the uniqueness of the regularisation method used in this paper .",
    "in particular , we would like to argue that the mode matching relation ( [ mode1 ] ) can be obtained from the condition that the difference between the two free energies is independent of the cutoff and tends to some finite value . here",
    "too we assume that the difference is finite for all values of @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "as we have noted before for charged scalar fields the difference between the free energies can be written as @xmath264 we want to find the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath40 for which the difference tends to a finite value independent of the cutoffs . in otherwords as @xmath258 or @xmath265 the difference between the free energy becomes unique and finite .",
    "though in principle @xmath128 depends on both @xmath43 and @xmath40 separately , we will notice that because of a unique relation between them we will get a finite value independent of both of them .",
    "hence the free energy difference can be written as @xmath266 where the first term is the universal component which is independent of the cutoff ( its value of course depends on @xmath267 and @xmath4 ) and the second term is the correction to it .",
    "the function @xmath268 is assumed to be a smooth function of @xmath40 and in the present analysis we are not interested in the actual form of it .",
    "we assume the cutoff to be high enough so that we can replace the sum by an integral . now",
    "if we demand that @xmath269 should be independent of the cutoff then we get an equation of the form @xmath270 we have used the symbol @xmath271 instead of an equal sign to signify  asymptotically approaching \" rather than equality between the two relations .",
    "in fact they are strictly equal only if the cutoff is taken to infinity .",
    "but , because of finite value of @xmath40 or @xmath43 however large , we do not expect strict equality in the above relation . from this equation in the first order approximation",
    "it is quite evident that there should be a relation between @xmath43 and @xmath40 such that @xmath272 this immediately gives a relation between the two cutoff within an undetermined constant @xmath273 as @xmath274 it is important to notice that this relation has been obtained in the limit of large enough cutoff .",
    "in fact as we have seen in the previous subsection the relation is valid for small as well as large value @xmath40 .",
    "however , the physical energy difference approaches to finite value as @xmath256 as we vary @xmath40 . in the next we will try to fix this constant from the fact that the difference goes to a finite value .",
    "we substitute this value in the free energy difference equation ( [ ws ] ) and plot the difference as a function of various values of @xmath40 for fixed values of b and m. then it turns out that the only allowed value of @xmath273 for the free energy to be finite and independent of the cutoff is @xmath267 .",
    "thus we find that the exact relation between the two cutoff is @xmath275 it is interesting to note that no other values of @xmath273 are allowed for the free energy difference to be finite and independent of cutoff .",
    "thus we have justified the mode matching relation ( [ mode1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , this is the only method by which one can get a unique finite cutoff - independent free energy difference ."
