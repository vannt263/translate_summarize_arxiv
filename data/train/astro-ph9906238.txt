    "novae in the optically thick wind phase of their outburst pose a special challenge for atmospheric modeling because of their steep temperature gradients , low densities , large geometric extents , and high velocity differential flows .",
    "for example , a model with a bolometrically defined effective temperature , @xmath3 , of 15 000 k will have values of the kinetic temperature , @xmath4 , that range from 4500 to 140 000 k , of the mass density , @xmath5 , that range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 g @xmath8 , a geometric extent , @xmath9 , equal to 120 ( this paper ) , and a typical maximum expansion velocity , @xmath10 , of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 .",
    "because of the low values of @xmath5 , radiative rates exceed collisional rates for many important transitions throughout the atmosphere .",
    "the steep @xmath4 gradient and low densities allow local regions to be exposed through scattering processes to radiation from distant regions in the atmosphere where the radiation temperature , @xmath13 , differs greatly from the local value of @xmath4 . moreover , massive ultraviolet ( @xmath1 ) and optical line blanketing cause the radiation field to deviate greatly from a planck ( @xmath14 ) distribution . as a result of these considerations ,",
    "non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects are severe in these atmospheres and must be accounted for to construct accurate models .",
    "the low values of @xmath5 cause the atmosphere to be translucent ( @xmath15 ) at large physical depths , which , combined with the large absolute value of @xmath16 , conspires to allow the line spectrum of many ionization stages of an atomic element to be present in the emergent flux spectrum .",
    "moreover , the rapid expansion velocities and steep @xmath17 gradients cause this rich line spectrum to be smeared , which complicates the radiative transfer by increasing the amount of overlap among different transitions . also , the large velocities cause special relativistic effects to be marginally significant in the transfer of radiation , at least to first order in @xmath18",
    ". finally , the large geometric extent allows sphericity effects to be important .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    @xcite and @xcite ( henceforth hssbsa ) investigated the effects of nlte on atmospheric models of novae in the optically thick wind phase of their outburst .",
    "they concluded that an accurate treatment of nlte effects for many transitions is critical for correctly calculating both the structure of the atmosphere and the emergent flux spectrum . among their main results",
    "are that : 1 ) nlte effects change the predicted concentration of minority ionization stages of elements that contribute significantly to the line opacity , such as fe and cno , by as much as three orders of magnitude at depths where the continuum optical depth at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is less than @xmath21 , 2 ) nlte effects brighten the predicted @xmath1 pseudo - continuum by as much as an order of magnitude in the case of their @xmath22 k model in the range @xmath23 , and 3 ) a minimal incorporation of nlte physics by including a large single scattering albedo in the line source functions of an lte synthetic spectrum gives rise to a spectrum with approximately the same overall level of line blanketing absorption as a more complete nlte treatment , although any individual line profile may be inaccurate .",
    "hssbsa concluded that their nlte models provided a better fit to observed spectra of novae .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    one of the limitations of the modeling of @xcite and hssbsa is the limited number of elements and ionization stages treated in nlte ( 15 elements and 36 stages ) .",
    "given the importance of nlte effects , we have increased the nlte treatment to include 19 elements and 87 ionization stages . in section [ snlte ]",
    "we describe the nlte treatment , in section [ smods ] we describe the nova models , in section [ sresult ] we present the results of our calculations , and in section [ sconc ] we present our conclusions .",

    "nlte effects on the @xmath4 structure are negligible in the @xmath33 model . from the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fstruc ] we see that nlte effects cause a slight reduction in @xmath75 around @xmath76 in the @xmath33 model and a general reduction throughout the atmosphere in the @xmath34 model for @xmath72 .",

    "the smoothing approximately reproduces the resolution of intermediate band photometry and wide band spectrophotometry and allows differences in the overall @xmath79 level to be more easily discerned .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    from the lower panels we see that nlte effects lead to large enhancements in @xmath79 for @xmath88 in the @xmath33 model and for @xmath89 in the @xmath34 model .",
    "by contrast , nlte effects lead to a _ reduction _ in the uv flux in the @xmath35 model for @xmath89 . for all three models , the current nlte",
    "treatment increases the size of the nlte deviation in @xmath79 significantly .",
    "the opacity sources that have the largest effect on the emergent flux below the lyman edge ( @xmath89 ) are @xmath30 absorption and line absorption .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fpp15 ] through [ fpp35 ] that the concentration is always significantly reduced by the effect of nlte at depths where @xmath90 , and is often enhanced higher up in the atmosphere . furthermore , the current nlte treatment serves variously to enhance or diminish the size of the nlte deviation in concentration .",
    "we may expect that , all else being equal , models in which the emergent flux in the lyman continuum arises from deeper in the atmosphere will be brighter in the uv in the case of nlte because the reduction in will allow flux to escape from deeper , hotter layers .",
    "by contrast , models in which this flux arises from higher up in the atmosphere will be dimmer in the case of nlte .",
    "the extent of the nlte effect on the emergent flux for particular nlte treatments will by modified by how that treatment effects the concentration .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    the situation is complicated by the competing effect of line opacity in determining the emergent uv flux . the net effect of nlte departures on all the metals that contribute significant line opacity may serve either to brighten or dim the flux . from an examination of the concentrations of the dominant fe ionization stages in figs .",
    "[ fpp15 ] through [ fpp35 ] , we see that in the case of @xmath33 the amount of fe line blanketing is enhanced by the current nlte treatment compared to the other two treatments , and in @xmath34 and @xmath35 fe line blanketing is reduced by both nlte treatments .",
    "it is not clear how this can be reconciled with the effects of nlte on the flux seen in figs .",
    "[ ffluxm1 ] through [ ffluxm3 ] , and we conclude that the competing influence of nlte on all the various absorbers that contribute significant opacity is too complex for a simple correlation between the emergent flux and the concentration of any one absorber to be apparent . finally , we note that generally the flux on the wien side of the planck distribution is a sensitive indicator of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the significant nlte effects on the uv flux seen here must be included accurately in models .",
    "[ figcomp ] shows the overall @xmath79 distribution for the @xmath34 model with complete line blanketing due to all species that contribute significant line opacity ( whether they are treated in lte or nlte ) , and with line blanketing due _ only _ to those species treated in nlte , as indicated in table 3 .",
    "a comparison of the two distributions allows an assessment of the completeness of the line opacity that is now treated in nlte .",
    "this is important for assessing the accuracy of the emergent flux spectrum , and also of the equilibrium atmospheric structure because line opacity is an important term in the radiative equilibrium of the atmosphere .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    the most obvious difference between the two @xmath79 distributions is that the lyman photo - ionization edge at @xmath91 is `` softened '' by line blanketing to a greater extent when lte lines are present .",
    "the missing nlte uv line opacity will mostly be accounted for once fe group species that have a rich line spectrum , such as and and and have been added in nlte . from table 1 it can be seen that we already have the facility to compute ni in nlte up to stage and co up to stage , but , as noted in section [ smods ] and in table 3 , these stages have not been included in these calculations for the sake of computational expediency . also , there is a noticeable underblanketing in the @xmath92 range in the treatment with nlte lines only compared to the fully blanketed treatment . nevertheless , from the qualitative similarity of the two @xmath79 distributions we can also see that the lines treated in nlte account for the vast majority of the total line opacity",
    ".      figs .",
    "[ fspec15 ] to [ fspec35 ] show the moderate resolution spectrum in three sample regions from the mid-@xmath1 to the near - ir .",
    "like hssbsa we find that the quasi - lte spectrum with a single scattering albedo incorporated into the line source function gives rise to lines that are approximately equal in strength to nlte lines .",
    "the quasi - lte approach gives rise to inaccurate line strengths for many particular lines , but does not systematically over - predict or under - predict line absorption .",
    "inspection of figs .",
    "[ fspec15 ] and [ fspec25 ] shows that the hssba and the current nlte treatment give rise to different line profiles for many lines , but the differences are not systematic .",
    "differences between the two nlte treatments are particularly apparent in the @xmath1 region of the @xmath34 model as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fspec25 ] .",
    "note that differences in the profiles of individual lines that arise from the nlte treatment may in general be due to a combination of effects : 1 ) changes in the line source function , @xmath93 , as a result of changes in the populations , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , of the levels connected by the transition and by the inclusion of a properly calculated scattering contribution in @xmath93 , 2 ) changes in the background continuous and line opacity due to nlte effects in other species , and 3 ) changes in the atmospheric structure such as those discussed in section [ sresstruc ] .",
    "in general , nlte effects should be included in as complete a way as possible to accurately calculate any particular line profile .",
    "generally , we find that the current , more complete nlte calculation gives rise to _ qualitatively _ the same results as the previous extensive nlte investigation of nova models , that of hssbsa .",
    "nlte may greatly affect : 1 ) the chemical concentration of species that are important to the total opacity of the model , such as and fe , or are astrophysically interesting , such as cno , mg , al , and ca , 2 ) the overall flux distribution , particularly in the @xmath1 ( @xmath96 ) , which is a sensitive @xmath3 indicator , and where nlte effects increase the flux by several orders of magnitude , 3 ) the strength of individual lines throughout the observable @xmath1 to @xmath87 region where nlte causes particular lines to be either weaker or stronger than those of a quasi - lte calculation that crudely incorporates nlte effects with a single scattering albedo , and 4 ) to a lesser extent , the atmospheric structure , particularly the @xmath75 structure in models of @xmath97 k. however , the current nlte treatment gives rise to specific deviations from lte values for many of these quantities that differ significantly from those of the hssbsa treatment .",
    "in particular , we note that for the hotter @xmath34 model ( @xmath98 k ) , in which nlte effects are generally larger than for the cooler @xmath33 model ( @xmath99 k ) , the more complete nlte treatment gives rise to an concentration , @xmath4 and @xmath75 structure , and @xmath1 flux level that are all significantly _ closer _ to the lte values than those of the less complete hssbsa nlte treatment .",
    "this result , which may seem counterintuitive at first , results from the increased number of channels through which the gas can thermalize when more species are included in the overall nlte solution . note that increasing the number of nlte species does not necessarily drive the solution for any model atmosphere closer to lte . rather , for the @xmath34 model in particular , the increase in the number of thermalization channels happens to have a dominant effect on the solution when the number of nlte species is increased from the hssbsa set to the current set .",
    "in general , nlte should be incorporated in as complete a way as possible for accurate structure and synthetic spectrum calculations for nova models in the 15 000 to 35 000 k @xmath3 range . in regard to the first point above , we draw special attention to the _ indirect _ effects that treating any one species in nlte may have on any other species . the atmospheric structure and the @xmath2 concentration both act as means of coupling all the species , including those that are treated in lte .",
    "generally , all species that contribute significantly to the @xmath2 reservoir by way of partial ionization , or whose line or continuous opacity is large enough to significantly effect the equilibrium structure of the atmosphere , must be treated in nlte to insure an accurate result for any particular species .",
    "this has a bearing on , for example , attempts to infer model parameters and abundances from fitting the @xmath1 and optical light curves of novae during the optically thick wind phase of their outburst .",
