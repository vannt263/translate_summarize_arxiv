    "the results illustrate that below the resonance , the bound on the @xmath7 mass becomes slightly tighter for narrower resonances ( smaller @xmath86 ) . in our model , the interference between @xmath3 and @xmath7 exchange amplitudes is always constructive in the energy region between the two resonances .",
    "the figure also illustrates that for a @xmath7 as light as 400  gev , a contact interaction is a reasonable approximation for effects at lep - ii energies .",
    "we shall use this later when comparing our bounds with those extracted by the lep - ii analysis group for contact interactions .     with @xmath196  gev for @xmath197 and for a contact interaction approximating the @xmath7 exchange amplitude.,width=453 ]    to quantify the bounds on the @xmath7 mass we construct a @xmath198 for a fit to lep - ii data with our model . in figure  [ chicomp ]",
    "we present this result after subtracting the @xmath198 from a standard model fit ( using the zfitter results quoted in ref .",
    "once again we show the three cases @xmath199 and a contact interaction approximation .",
    "it is important to notice , for example in figure  [ rbfig ] , that the lep - ii data are consistently below the standard model prediction .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the interference between the @xmath3 and @xmath7 amplitudes in our model is always constructive in this energy region , implies that the standard model is always a better fit than any of our @xmath7 models .",
    "if we require that the new model not deviate from the standard model by 2(3 ) standard deviations , we can place the bounds @xmath200  gev for @xmath201 .",
    "for fits to @xmath8 at lep - ii energies as a function of @xmath189 setting @xmath183.,width=453 ]    given that the lep - ii data is consistently below the standard model expectation , it is conceivable that there is some common systematic error not accounted for in the quoted error bars . to account for this possibility , we naively rescale the data by a common factor in such a way as to minimize the @xmath198 of the standard model fit . doing this results in lower bounds on the @xmath7 mass .",
    "for example , for @xmath202 the 2(3 ) sigma bounds move from 780  ( 595 )  gev to 530  ( 460 )  gev .",
    "we can also use the contact interaction approximation to bound the @xmath7 mass .",
    "the correspondence to table  8.12 of ref.@xcite is ( for no mixing ) , @xmath203 our model of section  ii generates both a @xmath204 contact interaction with @xmath205 and a @xmath206 contact interaction with @xmath207 . for constructive interference",
    "we thus infer the 95% confidence level bounds @xmath208  gev from the @xmath206 interaction and @xmath209  gev from the @xmath204 interaction .    from all this",
    "we conclude that in all cases the @xmath7 is already restricted to be heavier than about @xmath11  gev by lep - ii data .",
    "finally , since models without mixing also allow large couplings to the @xmath22-lepton , we show in figure  [ sigttfig ] the cross - section for @xmath210 at lep - ii .",
    "a calculation of the @xmath198 for the fit in this case indicates that the bounds on the @xmath7 mass are slightly higher than those obtained from studying @xmath8 , but not significantly so .     for @xmath184 .",
    "the data points are from ref .",
    "motivated by the 3-@xmath187 discrepancy between the standard model prediction and the measured forward - backward asymmetry @xmath2 at the @xmath3 peak we have studied models which can generate a sufficiently large @xmath1 through new non - universal right - handed gauge interactions .",
    "one possible mechanism to generate this @xmath1 is the mixing of the @xmath3 with a @xmath7 .",
    "we had already discussed a model like this in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we have illustrated several variations on that model that are also renormalizable and anomaly free . at the cost of introducing additional fermions , we showed two models that produce the required @xmath1 while satisfying the lep constraints on @xmath94 .",
    "we have also indicated how it is possible to modify these models so that they are not constrained by @xmath211 .",
    "we have identified a second mechanism to generate @xmath1 even in cases with no @xmath4 mixing .",
    "this occurs in models with an @xmath39 triplet of gauge bosons at one - loop , and can give rise to @xmath1 at the @xmath6 level . by itself , this mechanism is not sufficient to explain the full @xmath20 favored by the data .",
    "the simple model used to illustrate this effect , provides an example of a renormalizable model that can give rise to relatively large new interactions involving only the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks while respecting low energy constraints .",
    "finally we have used the lep - ii data for the process @xmath212 to place bounds on the mass of the @xmath7 in our models .",
    "this is a @xmath7 that couples weakly ( by a factor @xmath213 weaker than standard electroweak couplings ) to fermions of the first two generations .",
    "for this reason , standard bounds on @xmath7 gauge bosons do not apply .",
    "we find that the lep - ii data constrains it to be heavier than about @xmath11  gev in all cases .",
    "the contribution of the new gauge bosons in our models to the process @xmath214 , is of electroweak strength because the enhancement in the @xmath215 coupling is compensated by the suppression in the @xmath216 coupling . in this way ,",
    "our model is an example of a kind of new interactions that will only show their full strength in processes involving four third generation fermions . it may be possible for the lhc to study certain processes of this type , and we are currently investigating this possibility .",
