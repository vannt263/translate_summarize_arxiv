    "ngc  6764 is a nearby ( 32  mpc for @xmath4=75 km s@xmath3 ; 1@xmath5=160  pc ) s - shaped barred spiral galaxy ( sbb ) , classified as a liner galaxy on the basis of optical spectroscopy .",
    "the galaxy contains a nuclear stellar optical continuum source with a  width \" of @xmath6 or about 200  pc ( rubin , thonnard , & ford 1975 ) .",
    "ngc  6764 is unusual in that it displays a prominent 466 nm wolf - rayet emission feature at the nucleus .",
    "wolf - rayet emission features are rarely observed in galaxies , and their presence is indicative of very recent massive star formation ( armus , heckman & miley 1988 ; conti 1991 ) .",
    "the study of such objects is essential for understanding the starburst phenomenon in galaxies .",
    "+ a first analysis of the starburst activity in ngc  6764 was presented in eckart et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and eckart et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and revealed a dense concentration of molecular gas and a very recent ( at most a few times 10@xmath7 years ) starburst at the nucleus of ngc  6764 .",
    "here we present first k - band integral field spectroscopy of the ngc  6764 nucleus ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "observational details as well as a more thorough description of the analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "to investigate the nuclear star formation history further , we use the population synthesis code stars which was successfully applied to a number of galaxies ( e.g. krabbe , sternberg & genzel 1994 , ngc  1808 ) in conjunction with the nir spectral synthesis code specsyn ( schinnerer et al . 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "stars has as output observable parameters such as the bolometric luminosity l@xmath8 , the @xmath9 band luminosity l@xmath10 , the lyman continuum luminosity l@xmath11 and the supernova rate @xmath12 , as well as the diagnostic ratios between these quantities : l@xmath8/l@xmath11 , l@xmath10/l@xmath11 and 10@xmath13/l@xmath11 .",
    "all three ratios are measures of the time evolution and the shape of the imf , with slightly different dependencies on its slope @xmath14 and upper mass cutoff m@xmath15 . h - r diagrams representing the distribution of these luminosities are calculated .",
    "specsyn uses the distribution of k band luminosity l@xmath10 within the h - r diagram to weight standard star spectra of different spectral type and luminosity ( schinnerer et al .",

    "( @xmath1 500  pc ) of ngc  6764 we followed the approach of eckart et al .",
    "_ l@xmath16 _ and _ l@xmath11 _ were estimated via the equations given in genzel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( using a @xmath17 = 0.6@xmath18 m as the @xmath9 band width ) and taking the values measured with 3d in a 3  aperture . from our analysis",
    "we infer an extinction towards the nuclear stellar cluster of about ( 2 - 3)@xmath19 in agreement with the observed br@xmath20/br@xmath21 ratio and earlier findings by eckart et al .",
    "in addition we see evidence for a 5% non - stellar contribution to the @xmath9 band continuum either from warm dust or a power law contribution from the agn itself . for _",
    "@xmath12 _ we used the relation given by condon ( 1992 ) and the nuclear 5 ghz flux of 3.4 mjy from baum et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "given the presence of the wr stars two scenarios have been considered : ( 1 ) two starburst events and ( 2 ) continuous star formation .",
    "both possibilities are explored in the following .",
    "+   + _ two young starbursts : _ the wolf - rayet features indicate a very recent star formation event only about 5 myrs ago .",
    "this immediately implies a second starburst event to account for the presence of the cool evolved stars indicated by the stellar absorption features ( see fit in fig.1 ) .",
    "the current appearance of the ngc  6764 nucleus may therefore be dominated by two major starburst events : +   + _ starburst about 5  myrs ago ( sb#1 ) : _ assuming a starburst event with a decay time of 3  myrs seems reasonable given the fact that sn explosions might disturb the ism medium and prevent further star formation . for a starburst of that age stars",
    "gives a mean hot star of type o5 with a mean effective temperature of t@xmath22=45000k .",
    "boer & schulz ( 1989 ) find an electron density of of @xmath23 @xmath24 6@xmath010@xmath25@xmath26 ( with @xmath27=10@xmath28k ) .",
    "neglecting dilution effects this gives an hei / br@xmath21 ratio of 0.7 ( lanon & rocca - volmerage 1996 ) .",
    "comparison of @xmath9 band spectra from active galaxies with an agn and starburst galaxies ( vanzi et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests that strong hei line emission is only present in starburst galaxies .",
    "this may indicate that most of the hei line flux observed towards the nucleus of ngc  6764 is due to young , hot stars and not due to an agn component .",
    "this allows us to correct the observed hei / br@xmath21 ratio and obtain the br@xmath21 line flux that is associated with this starburst event .",
    "we derive that about 65% of the br@xmath21 line flux is due to an 5  myrs old starburst .",
    "+   + _ starburst about 16 myrs ago ( sb#2 ) : _ this second starburst has to account for about 94% of the total l@xmath16  and the total amount of @xmath12 . if the age is about 20  myrs all br@xmath21 line flux not accounted by sb#1 could be associated with the liner nucleus . for starbursts with ages of @xmath1 1  gyr agb stars",
    "have a prominent contribution to the @xmath9 band continuum ( lanon & rocca - volmerage 1994 , lanon & rocca - volmerage 1996 ) .",
    "however , in the case of the ngc  6764 nucleus a starburst of this age can not account for the observed extended nonthermal radio emission which is very likely due to star formation , e.g. sn explosions . a starburst age of @xmath1 1  gyr",
    "therefore does not appear to be very plausible for sb#2 .",
    "this scenario is similar to the one found in ic  342 where a 70  pc diameter starburst ring with an age of about 5  myrs surrounds a nuclear starburst of about 15  myrs ( bker , frster - schreiber & genzel 1997 ) .",
    "+   + _ continuous star formation : _ assuming continuous star formation in the nuclear region the stellar cluster must have an age of @xmath29 1 gyr , since enough cool evolved stars are produced to obtain the observed ratio of l@xmath10 to l@xmath11 ratio .",
    "it is necessary to reach the agb phase to obtain a reasonable fit , since only then the cool luminous stars are numerous .",
    "this analysis is , however , hampered by the fact , that the currently available evolutionary tracks of the high mass stars in general do not produce very cold red super - giants ( e.g. of type m ) and that specsyn does not use spectra of agb stars .",
    "we use evolutionary tracks extended for the agb phase ( n.m .",
    "schreiber 1998 , phd thesis , lmu munich ) and approximate the spectra of agb stars by those of a red m type super - giant ( rsg ) . in this scenario , it is expected that the wr emission and the stellar absorption bands would have similar distribution even at highest spatial resolution .",
    "the corresponding fit to the data is of similar quality as the fit for two bursts shown in fig.1 .",
    "+   + * in summary : * the hot stars ( hei / br@xmath21 ratio of 0.46@xmath30 0.06 indicating t@xmath22 @xmath1 35 000 k ) , the wolf - rayet stars ( 466 nm wolf - rayet emission feature ) and the evolved cool stars ( see co absorption band heads at @xmath31 2.29 @xmath18 m and nai absorption at 2.21 @xmath18 m ) could be either co - spatial or might form a young starburst ring around the older nuclear stellar cluster as observed in ic  342 ( bker , frster - schreiber & genzel 1997 ) .",
    "our analysis indicates two possible nuclear star formation histories : ( 1 ) two starbursts with ages of about 5  myrs and about 16  myrs and decay times of 3  myrs producing the wr stars and red super - giants that contribute to a large amount of the @xmath9 band continuum .",
