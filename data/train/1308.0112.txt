    "the violent episodes of mass loss that occur in the latest evolutionary phases of some massive stars represent an important unsolved problem in astrophysics . the fits of eruptive and explosive non - terminal mass loss help define the observational phenomenon referred to collectively as luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) ; they have no identified physical driving mechanism , despite the fact that they may dominate the mass lost during the lives of the most massive stars ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "historically associated with the most luminous blue supergiant stars in the milky way and its nearest neighbors ( hubble & sandage 1953 ; conti 1984 ; humphreys & davidson 1994 ; smith et al .",
    "2004 ) , lbvs have also been linked with a class of extragalactic transient sources that have typical peak absolute visual magnitudes around @xmath614 mag , with outflow speeds of several hundred km s@xmath7 ( smith et al .",
    "2011a ; van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ; kochanek et al.2012 ) .",
    "this diverse class of eruptions has long been discussed in the context of extreme winds driven by super - eddington luminosities ( e.g. , owocki et al .",
    "2004 ) , but growing evidence suggests that some cases can be explained as hydrodynamic ( but non - terminal ) explosions that power their emergent radiation through a shock interacting with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) , as in the prototypical case of @xmath8 carinae ( smith 2013a ; 2008 ) .",
    "type iin supernovae ( sne ) may result from a special case of these eruptions in the very latest phases of massive star evolution before core collapse .",
    "their namesake narrow h lines indicate dense , slow csm surrounding the sn , which in turn requires eruptive lbv - like mass loss to eject so much mass so soon before core collapse .",
    "evidence providing a strong link between lbvs and sne iin comes in two key flavors : ( 1 ) super - luminous sne  iin , where the demands on the amount of h - rich csm mass are so extreme ( 10 - 20 @xmath9 in some cases ) that very massive stars are required , and the inferred radii and expansion speeds of the csm require that it be ejected in a short time within just a few years before core collapse ( smith et al .  2007 , 2008 , 2010a ; smith & mccray 2007 ; woosley et al .  2007 ;",
    "van marle et al .",
    "2009 ) , and ( 2 ) direct detections of progenitors of sne  iin that are consistent with massive lbv - like stars ( gal - yam & leonard 2009 ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2007 ; smith et al .",
    "2010b , 2011a , 2012 ; kochanek et al .",
    "we should note , however , that not all sne iin are necessarily tied to lbvs and the most massive stars",
    ". some sne  iin may actually be type ia explosions with dense csm ( e.g. , silverman et al.2013 and references therein ) , some may be electron - capture sn explosions of stars with initial masses around 810 @xmath9 ( smith 2013b ; mauerhan et al .  2013b ; chugai et al .",
    "2004 ) , and some may arise from extreme red supergiants like vy  cma with very dense winds ( smith et al .  2009a , 2009b ; mauerhan & smith 2012 ; chugai & danziger 1994 ) .",
    "sn  2009ip was nearby , and an extraordinarily well - observed event .",
    "the progression of the several - year pre - sn variability that culminated in the dramatic 2012 event has now been recounted in detail by several authors ( smith et al .  2010b , 2013 ; foley et al .",
    "2011 ; mauerhan et al .",

    "2013 ) . first discovered in 2009 by the chase project ( maza et al .",
    "2009 ) and originally given a sn designation , the object turned out to be an lbv - like eruptive transient ( at least until 2012 ) .",
    "sn  2009ip displayed a series of brief brightening episodes with absolute magnitude peaks of roughly @xmath614 mag , consistent with lbv - like eruptions ( smith et al .",
    "2011a ) , as well as a longer duration s dor - like eruption before that ( smith et al .",
    "spectra of these outbursts exhibited narrow emission lines indicating dominant outflow speeds around 600 km s@xmath7 , although a small amount of material was accelerated to higher speeds of several thousand km s@xmath7 ( smith et al .",
    "2010b ; foley et al.2011 ; pastorello et al .",
    "this is reminiscent of @xmath8 carinae in its 19th century eruption ( smith 2006 , 2008 , 2013a ) .    sn  2009ip then sufferred a much more extreme event in 2012 ( discovered by drake et al .",
    "2012 ) , when it first brightened to roughly @xmath615 mag and exhibited broad emission lines with outflow speeds of order @xmath110,000 km s@xmath7 ( mauerhan et al .",
    "this first peak in august / september ( 2012a ) initially faded by @xmath10.8 mag over 20 days , but was followed by an extremely rapid rise to a second peak in october ( 2012b ) with a luminosity of roughly @xmath618.0 mag ( @xmath10-band ; see figure  [ fig : phot ] ) .",
    "mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2013a ) proposed that the initial fainter 2012a peak was the actual sn explosion , whereas the fast rise to peak in 2012b was caused by csm interaction as the fast sn ejecta caught up to the csm ejected in the lbv - like eruptions one or more years before .",
    "if the 2012 event really was a core - collapse sn , it would dramatically confirm that lbv - like stars do in fact explode as sne , which would expose significant errors in the most fundamental paradigms of current stellar evolution models .",
    "as reviewed by langer ( 2012 ) , models for massive star evolution envision that very massive stars in the local universe will shed all their h envelopes via stellar winds , will become wolf - rayet stars , and will explode as h - poor sne of types ib or ic ( see e.g. , heger et al .",
    "2003 ; maeder & meynet 2000 ; langer et al .",
    "thus , the case of sn  2009ip - with a very massive lbv - like star exploding as a sn  iin before losing its h envelope  would be a very important discrepancy with models of massive star evolution .",
    "smith & arnett ( 2013 ) have recently discussed a likely reason why 1-d stellar evolution calculations would fail to account for the pre - sn variability that is observed , centered on the treatment of convection in late burning stages .    however , the idea that the 2012 brightening of sn  2009ip was a true core - collapse sn has been controversial .",
    "the initial faintness of the 2012a outburst caused some doubt ( margutti et al .",
    "2012a ; martin et al .",
    "2012 ) , but some core - collapse sne are faint initially if the progenitor has a compact radius as in the vivid case of sn  1987a ( e.g. , arnett 1989 ) . in any case , sn  2009ip then brightened very quickly to a luminosity commensurate with normal sne ( brimacombe 2012 ; margutti et al . 2012b",
    "; smith & mauerhan 2012b ) .",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "( 2013 ) proposed that the 2012 event of sn  2009ip was not a sn , referring to the broad absorption wings seen in the precursor events in previous years as evidence that high speeds do not necessarily require a final core - collapse event .",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "( 2013 ) instead favored the idea that the 2012 event of sn  2009ip was the result of a non - terminal pulsational pair instability ( ppi ) eruption ( e.g. , heger & woosley 2002 ; woosley et al .  2007 ; chatzopoulos & wheeler 2012 ) .",
    "fraser et al .  ( 2013a ) presented additional data and continued to favor the ppi model instead of core collapse , based on the lack of nebular features during the decline that are seen seen in normal sne , and they predicted that the star would therefore survive and return to its previous state when it emerged from behind the sun .",
    "margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) presented a very extensive and comprehensive analysis of multiwavelength spectra and photometry during the main 2012 bright phase of sn  2009ip .",
    "these data were consistent with the idea that the main properties of sn  2009ip could be explained by modest csm interaction involving a total energy of at least 10@xmath4 erg , but these authors favored the interpretation of a non - terminal shell ejection event .",
    "the crux of the debate is that it is not immediately obvious that sn  2009ip was a core - collapse event , since it is a type iin supernova  these are strongly influenced by csm interaction , and so they do nt always look like `` normal '' examples of familiar sne with well - defined photospheric and nebular phases . in particular ,",
    "the nucleosynthetic products normally seen in nebular features are usually masked in sne  iin due to ongoing csm interaction .",
    "moreover , since csm interaction is the main engine , any type of fast ejecta crashing into a slower csm shell might power a luminous display ( e.g. , dessart et al .  2009 ;",
    "woosley et al .  2007 ;",
    "smith 2013b ) . due to the high efficiency of converting kinetic energy into radiated luminosity ( van marle et al .  2009 ;",
    "smith & mccray 2007 ; woosley et al .",
    "2007 ) , even relatively low - energy ( @xmath110@xmath4 erg ) explosions can in principle produce bright transients comparable to sne if most of the kinetic energy is tapped .",
    "such low energy explosions combined with csm interaction have recently been proposed as viable power sources for the crab s sn in 1054 ad ( smith 2013b ) , @xmath8 car s 19th century eruption ( smith 2013a ) , and sn  1994w ( dessart et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "there are , however , clues in the spectroscopic evolution that must be reconciled with the energy budget in csm interaction , and there are potentially some clear tests in the late - time nature of the surviving ( or not ) object . when sn  2009ip re - emerged from behind the sun in 2013 , fraser et al .",
    "( 2013b ) reported a spectrum and photometry , and claimed that the star was returning to its pre - sn lbv state .",
    "our late - time data reported here strongly contradict this conclusion , as detailed below .",
    "moreover , we argue that observations require the combination of a normal core - collapse sn energy ( @xmath11@xmath1110@xmath0 ergs ) combined with csm interaction in an asymmetric environment .    the present paper is organized around three main points , which serve to argue that 2009ip was indeed a core - collapse sn as originally proposed by mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2013a ) :    \\1 .",
    "we argue that sn  2009ip ( 2012a / b ) was essentially identical to sn  2010mc .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2013 ) already showed this based on photometry , which was also found in the analysis by margutti et al.(2013 ) . here",
    "we extend the comparison to spectra of sn  2010mc and sn  2009ip , showing that they are carbon copies of one another at early times .",
    "we present new late - time photometry and spectra of both sn  2009ip and sn  2010mc , both of which appear consistent with type  iin supernovae dominated by csm interaction at late times , but which do not indicate a return to the lbv - like states of the progenitors .",
    "sn  2009ip , in particular , shows the trend of strongly increasing h@xmath3 emission equivalent width , which in sne iin is due to the continuum optical depth decreasing when the csm shell expands and becomes transparent . after 3 years",
    ", sn  2010mc has only continued to fade , showing no sign of renewed lbv - like activity , and its late time spectrum shows no detectable continuum and only a faint and narrow h@xmath3 line consistent with late - time csm interaction in a decelerated shell .",
    "contrary to claims made by fraser et al.(2013b ) , our late time spectrum of sn  2009ip clearly does not resemble its previous lbv - like state .",
    "instead , it appears very similar to spectra of well studied core - collapse sne like sn  1999em and sn  1987a , with the exception that roughly half the continuum luminosity and the strong narrow emission lines come from csm interaction luminosity .",
    "we point out several other aspects relevant to this discussion that make a non - sn interpretation physically unlikely , statistically improbable , and not self consistent . in particular ,",
    "when one takes into account an asymmetric csm , this has important implications for the total energy budget  if csm interaction occurs in only a small fraction of the solid angle , then the mass and explosion energy derived from csm - interaction diagnostics are only lower limits .",
    "moreover , we show that the explosion must have been substantially asymmetric to account for the persistent broad lines seen at late times , and the sn ejecta must have been substantially more massive than the minimum required for csm interaction because they remain opaque for several months .",
    "this , combined with the fast expansion speeds observed in spectra , raises the required explosion energy to be at least 10@xmath0 ergs .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the light curve can be explained quite well with published models of core - collapse sne from a blue supergiant , like sn  1987a , with the caveat that the 2012b peak was dominated by csm interaction as indicated by spectra .",

    "( 2013 ) provide the bolometric luminosity , the curve appears to level off , and this is consistent with our last late - time @xmath10-band measurement before sn  2009ip became unobservable behind the sun ( around @xmath22=100 days ) .        when sn  2009ip reappeared from behind the sun about 100 days later , it was roughly 1 mag fainter in @xmath10 .",
    "this rate of fading is consistent with @xmath5co  @xmath5fe radioactive decay luminosity .",
    "this differs from the claim made by fraser et al .",
    "( 2013b ) that the late - time fading rate is inconsistent with radioactive decay .",
    "for comparison , figure  [ fig : phot ] shows the radioactive decay luminosity corresponding to a synthesized @xmath5ni mass of 0.04 @xmath9 ( dashed gray line ) , tied to the bolometric luminosity at @xmath1100 days .",
    "this inferred mass of synthesized @xmath5ni depends on the date that one assumes for the time of the sn explosion ( @xmath13 ) . for reasons outlined below , we set @xmath13 to be just before the beginning of the 2012a precursor event , at roughly @xmath647 days in figure  [ fig : phot ] . we caution that although the day 100 - 200 fading rate appears to be entirely consistent with radioactive decay , we know that the h@xmath3 luminosity is substantial and that sn  2009ip still has ongoing csm interaction that makes a contribution to the @xmath10-band luminosity . at later epochs",
    ", the light curve appears to flatten out .",
    "the latest decay rate appears very similar to that of sn  2010mc , although at a lower overall luminosity .",
    "this means that radioactive decay contributes a smaller and smaller fraction of the luminosity as time proceeds , so the best time to detect a signature of radiactive decay would be days 100 - 200 .",
    "in fact , most sne  iin do seem to have light curves that flatten at late times due to ongoing csm interaction , although a wide variety of decline rates are seen at different times , due to different csm density and radial extent .",
    "for example , sn  2005ip showed a late - time luminosity that was essentially flat for several years ( smith et al.2009b ; fox et al .",
    "2011 ; stritzinger et al .  2012 ) , whereas the decline rate for sn  1998s measured by li et al .",
    "( 2002 ) was much steeper , although not as steep as for pure radiaoctive decay .",
    "indeed , at very late times ( 5000 + days ) sn  1998s did eventually flatten - out as well , as indicated by measurements published recently ( mauerhan & smith 2012 ) .",
    "a spectrum at that time showed very clear signs of csm interaction in sn  1998s , with some fast and oxygen - rich material still crashing into the reverse shock , and was not consistent with a return to a surviving luminous star .",
    "the possibility that oxygen - rich ejecta may take several years to cross the reverse shock is relevant to the discussion of the `` nebular phase '' spectra below ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "our measurement of the late - time decline rate of sn  2010mc shows that it is intermediate between the normal sn  iin 1998s and the unusually long - lasting sn  2005ip , and its late - time spectrum is consistent with ongoing csm interaction ( see below ) . in the originally submitted version of this paper",
    ", we stated that it should not be surprising if sn  2009ip follows a similar trend in coming years . indeed , more recent data now confirm that sn  2009ip s late - time light curve is flattening out .",
    "this flattening is still @xmath1100 times more luminous than the progenitor star , so this does not indicate that a star survived the event .",
    "what about the main event ?",
    "as proposed by mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2013a ) , we have adopted the hypothesis that the initial 2012a brightening of sn  2009ip was the actual sn explosion event , and that the very broad balmer lines seen in the spectrum at that time ( smith & mauerhan 2012a ; mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ) were produced in the rapidly expanding sn ejecta recombination photosphere .",
    "similarly , we have attributed the 2012b event and its very rapid rise ( prieto et al .",
    "2013 ) to mark the onset of intense csm interaction , when some of the very fast ejecta from the 2012a event crashed into the csm produced by events 1 - 3 yr earlier .",
    "the 2012a event is somewhat faint compared to the peak luminosities of normal type ibc and type ii sne ( typically around @xmath616 to @xmath617 mag ) , but it is also true that one expects to see an initially lower luminosity for a relatively compact massive progenitor , such as the case of sn  1987a ( e.g. , arnett et al .",
    "1989 ) . indeed , the early - time luminosity of the 2012a event is the same as in sn  1987a at a similar epoch ( figure  [ fig : phot ] ) . as another example of a relatively faint sn ,",
    "figure  [ fig : phot ] shows the @xmath10/unfiltered light curve of the recent peculiar event sn  2010jp ( smith et al .",
    "2012 ) , as a blue curve that provides a reasonable match to the luminosity evolution of the 2012a event of sn  2009ip , until the moment when csm interaction turns on .",
    "sn  2010jp was thought to be an unusual jet - driven sn , which may have produced a relatively low mass of synthesized @xmath5ni ( about 0.003 @xmath9 ) , perhaps because of fallback into the same black hole that launched the jets ( smith et al .",
    "this is predicted to occur in some massive stars at relatively low metallicity ( e.g. , heger et al .",
    "2003 ) . in that case , this comparison ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ) to the initial 2012a peak of sn  2009ip is potentially quite interesting , since both sn  2009ip and sn  2010jp were massive stars that exploded in the extremely remote ( and presumably lower - metallicity ) regions of their host galaxies .",
    "indeed , both margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and fraser et al .",
    "( 2013a ) inferred a sub - solar metallicity for the remote location of sn  2009ip .",
    "moreover , sn  2010mc resides in a rather faint dwarf galaxy host ( figure  [ fig : img ] ; ofek et al .",
    "2013a ) , for which we measure an absolute @xmath16 magnitude of roughly @xmath616.9 mag in our lbt image ; this places its host galaxy at a luminosity comparable to that of the small magellanic cloud , strongly suggesting sub - solar metallicity ( probably 0.20.4 @xmath23 ) .",
    "the behavior of the 2012a event is discussed in more detail in section 4 .",
    "one further comparison deserves mention .",
    "figure  [ fig : phot ] also includes the light curve of the prototypical type iin sn  1998s , with @xmath10-band photometry from fassia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as well as more recently published very early time photometry on the rise to peak from poon et al .",
    "sn  1998s was about 0.5 mag more luminous at peak ; if it is scaled to match the 2012b peak of sn  2009ip , we see that the shape of the light curve is quite similar .",
    "the very rapid rise to peak is almost identical to sn  2009ip and sn  2010mc , and the decay from peak is marginally slower . at early times near peak in sn  1998s , the spectrum showed a smooth blue continuum , lorentzian profiles of balmer emission lines , and the wolf - rayet `` bump '' ( he  ii @xmath244686 and n  iii ) in emission ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ) , just like sn  2009ip at its 2012b peak ( mauerhan et al.2013 ; figure  [ fig : earlyspec ] ) .",
    "this comparison is interesting , since sn  1998s did show a radioactive decay tail at late times , and it did eventually show oxygen - rich ejecta crossing the reverse shock at very late times ( mauerhan & smith 2012 ) .",
    "it has also been proposed that the csm of sn  1998s was concentrated in an equatorial ring ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ) , as we suggest for sn  2009ip ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : earlyspec ] compares our spectra of sn  2009ip to the available spectra of sn  2010mc at early times around peak luminosity , in chronological order relative to the same initial onset of the rise to peak .",
    "it is clear from this comparison that the spectra form a continuous time sequence , and that the nearly identical character of the light curves extends to their spectral evolution .",
    "one minor difference is that at all epochs ( including at later times ) , he   i emission lines tend to be stronger in sn  2009ip . since the apparent continuum temperatures are similar , this may indicate a higher he abundance in sn  2009ip .",
    "the key characteristics displayed by the early - time spectra are ( 1 ) a hot blue continuum , ( 2 ) strong narrow balmer emission lines with broad lorentzian wings , ( 3 ) much fainter underlying broad emission and absorption components that are not always easily seen , and ( 4 ) an emission bump from he  ii at the very earliest times .",
    "these properties are quite commonly seen in other normal sne  iin as well , including prototypical objects like sn  1998s and others ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ; kiewe et al .",
    "2012 ; gal - yam et al .  2007 ;",
    "smith et al.2008 , 2009b , 2010a ; taddia et al .",
    "for comparison , figure  [ fig : earlyspec ] also shows an early - time spectrum of sn  2006tf , which is a super - luminous sn iin and quite likely to be a terminal sn explosion ( smith et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "as sn  2009ip reached its 2012b peak , the very broad emission and absorption components that had been present in its spectrum in the 2012a event became less prominent or even seemed to disappear .",
    "this is thought to be due to the increased continuum luminosity from csm interaction causing a photosphere outside the forward shock , and is a common property of sne  iin ( although the presence of broad lines _ before _",
    "the peak has not actually been observed in other sne  iin , since no other object has such early pre - peak spectra available ) .",
    "the underlying broad p cygni profile of h@xmath3 is faintly visible in our day 12 spectrum of sn  2009ip ( figure  [ fig : earlyspec ] ) ; at this epoch , we find that we can roughly match the strength and profile of the observed broad h@xmath3 component by combining the day @xmath617 ( 2012a ) spectrum with a 13,000  k blackbody , contributing roughly 5% and 95% of the continuum flux , respectively .",
    "thus , from the spectrum it would seem that the underlying broad sn photosphere spectrum never disappeared completely , but was simply outshined by the very bright and hot continuum from csm interaction at the peak of 2012b .",
    "this is quite consistent with our interpretation of the light curve in figure  [ fig : phot ] , where the underlying sn ( assuming that its intrinsic light curve is similar to sn  2010jp ) would be @xmath13 mag fainter than the peak , indicating that it contributes less than 10% of the observed flux .",
    "similarly , the underlying broad component of h@xmath3 is faint but clearly present in the day 14 , 21 , and 27 spectra of sn  2010mc ( figure  [ fig : earlyspec ] and ofek et al.2013a ) .      as sn  2009ip faded from its 2012b peak luminosity , the broad components in the line profiles reappeared , as shown by mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2013a ) .",
    "this is also commonly seen in normal sne  iin , such as sn  1998s ( leonard et al .",

    "2007 ) , and others . in csm interaction",
    ", the thin cold dense shell of post - shock gas continues to expand .",
    "if the density of the pre - shock csm drops , then the csm interaction luminosity also drops .",
    "the freely expanding sn ejecta are seen at late times , as confirmed by the fact that the underlying broad - line spectrum of sn  2009ip at day 60 , excluding the narrow emission - line components , is matched well by a spectrum of a normal sn  ii - p at a comparable epoch .",
    "figure  [ fig : l8spec ] compares the day 60 spectrum of sn  2009ip ( black ) to a spectrum of sn  1999em ( red ) ; here we have combined the sn  1999em spectrum with a blackbody ( each contributes half of the red continuum flux ) to mute the strength of the absorption and emission lines , as would be expected if some of the continuum luminosity is still contributed by csm interaction ( this is the case in other sne  iin as well ; see see smith et al .",
    "the shape of the continuum , the undulations in the continuum due to blended broad absorption lines , the broad component of h@xmath3 , and the very broad p cygni profile of the ca  ii ir triplet in sn  2009ip are all reminiscent of a sn  ii - p .",
    "margutti et al .  (",
    "2013 ) also showed a similar comparison , noting that sn  2009ip at 51 days after peak ( roughly day 60 relative to the minimum ) closely resembled the spectrum of the sn ii - p 2006bp at a similar epoch ( day 73 ) .",
    "however , margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) chose to interpret sn  2009ip as a non - sn event .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : l8spec ] shows that the day 82 spectrum of sn  2009ip is very well matched by a day 81 spectrum of sn  1987a during its decline from peak , also with 50% of the red continuum contributed by a blackbody ( and of course , narrow emission lines from csm interaction are missing in sn  1987a s spectrum ) .",
    "the broad p cygni profile of he  i @xmath245876 is almost identical in both objects , whereas the broad p cygni component of h@xmath3 has similar strength but @xmath110% lower velocities in sn  1987a .",
    "the fact that we see a sn - like continuum with broad emission lines  even at late times after sn  2009ip fades from its peak luminosity  is extremely important for understanding the true nature of sn  2009ip . in order to see this underlying sn continuum with broad p cygni lines ,",
    "the expanding fast ejecta must remain optically thick until late times .",
    "the relevant timescale is the diffusion time for an expanding envelope , given by @xmath25 days ( @xmath26 ) , where @xmath27 is the mass of the ejected envelope in @xmath9 and @xmath28 is the radius in units of 10@xmath29 cm ( see smith & mccray 2007 ; arnett 1996 ) .",
    "for the sn ejecta to remain opaque at day 60 , at which time margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) calculate a minimum blackbody radius ( assuming spherical symmetry ) of 1.5@xmath1110@xmath29 cm , we would require at least @xmath14 @xmath9 in the expanding stellar envelope .",
    "if the time of explosion is actually 47 days earlier , as we advocate in this paper , then the required mass is even larger ( at least 6 @xmath9 ) .",
    "these mass estimates are quite approximate ( factor of @xmath12 uncertainty ) , but it seems clear that the explosion ejecta must substantially exceed 1 @xmath9 . at the same epoch ( day 60 ) , we measure a fwhm for the h@xmath3 emission line of 8940 ( @xmath17100 ) km s@xmath7 .",
    "this speed would imply an explosion energy of roughly 3@xmath1110@xmath0ergs ( or more for an explosion date at @xmath647 days ) .    quoted ejecta mass values of @xmath10.1 @xmath9 ( margutti et al.2013 ; fraser et al .",
    "2013a ) are estimated by the _",
    "minimum _ mass needed to account for the peak luminosity through csm interaction , whereas we estimate the mass needed to keep the ejecta opaque for 60 - 100 days .",
    "these two are not really in conflict , since the @xmath10.1 @xmath9 mass estimated from csm interaction is only a lower limit  it is only a minimum because not all the envelope mass must participate in csm interaction ( only the fastest material reaches the shock at early times ) , and because the csm may only intercept a small fraction of the solid angle of the ejecta if the csm is asymmetric ( as it must be ; see below ) .",
    "the envelope mass could be lower than estimated from the diffusion time if the luminosity at 60 - 100 days is powered largely by radioactive decay , but that too would require a core - collapse sn event .",
    "the persistence of these underlying broad p cygni components at late times therefore rules out the interpretation of sn  2009ip s 2012 event as the loss of a mere 0.1 @xmath9 in a 10@xmath4 erg explosive shell ejection event . expanding at @xmath18000 km s@xmath7",
    ", 0.1 @xmath9 of ejecta would become fully transparent in only a few days .",
    "it is much more straightforward to explain sn  2009ip as a true core - collapse event .",
    "after day 60 , the broad emission lines get stronger as the continuum continues to fade . particularly noteworthy",
    "is the increasing strength of the broad emission from the ca  ii ir triplet around 8500  , which becomes very strong by the time sn  2009ip reappeared from behind the sun ( after day 190 ) .",
    "this is typical of core - collapse sne .",
    "sne  iin , in particular , tend to have ca  ii emission absent at early times , whereas at 50 - 100 days this broad feature appears and becomes strong ( in some cases comparable to h@xmath3 ) .",
    "strong and broad ca  ii emission is not ever seen in lbvs ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2011a ) , at least not at such high speeds of several 10@xmath30 km s@xmath7 . in figure",
    "[ fig : l8spec2 ] we show our late - time spectra of sn  2009ip on a linear scale , with the flux normalized to the continuum level ; figure  [ fig : l8spec2 ] shows the pre - sn spectrum of the lbv progenitor of sn  2009ip , in which the ca  ii ir triplet is much weaker and narrow , with no p cygni absorption component .",
    "figure  [ fig : l8spec2 ] also shows the late - time ( day 445 ) spectrum of sn  2006tf ( smith et al .",
    "2008 ) for comparison . except for the fainter he  i lines and the 7300   feature in sn  2006tf ( probably indicative of sn  2009ip s higher he abundance and underlying nebular spectrum ; see section 4 ) , the spectrum is very similar to the day 193 spectrum of sn  2009ip , including the flat shape of the continuum ( or psuedo continuum from blended emission lines ) , h@xmath3 , and the ca  ii ir triplet .",
    "these late - time spectra are very unlike the pre - sn spectrum of sn  2009ip , shown ( in yellow ) in the same figure with the same red continuum normalization . the pre - sn spectrum of sn  2009ip has a much steeper blue continuum , weaker emission lines , and much narrower emission lines .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fig : l8spec2 ] compares the h@xmath3 profiles of sn  2009ip , sn  2010mc , and sn  2006tf at late times , along with the h@xmath3 profile of the sn  2009ip progenitor .",
    "the day 190 - 400 spectra of sn  2009ip and sn  2006tf share similar broad profiles that are unlike the much weaker and narrower lorentzian profile of the progenitor lbv star .",
    "we noted in the introduction that although the lbv progenitor of sn  2009ip did show some high speed material in absorption before its 2012 event , it had never exhibited the broad balmer p cygni emission lines that are characteristic of sn ejecta photospheres .",
    "our late - time spectrum of sn  2010mc , taken on day 1024 , is plotted as well in figure  [ fig : l8spec ] . by this very late epoch",
    ", we see that the continuum has continued to fade , so that the spectrum is dominated by h@xmath3 emission .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission has also become narrower , with a width of @xmath172000 km s@xmath7 , presumably because the fast ejecta have either become transparent or because they have decelerated in ongoing csm interaction .",
    "this indicates that even after @xmath13 yr , sn  2010mc is still not returning to an lbv - like state with a strong blue continuum and lorentzian line profiles .",
    "finally , the near - ir spectra obtained on days 204 and 278 also show that the late - time spectra of sn  2009ip have taken on a new character , unlike spectra seen in previous epochs of this object .",
    "similar to the visual - wavelength spectra where the continuum has faded and h@xmath3 is much stronger than at any previous time , the ir spectrum shows many of the same emission lines as before , but the lines are relatively much stronger compared to the continuum ( figure  [ fig : irspec ] ) .",
    "in addition to the lines labeled in figure  [ fig : irspec ] , one can clearly see several lines of the h  i brackett series and paschen series in emission .",
    "the increasing relative strength of both h and he  i lines is probably due to the explosion becoming optically thin and the continuum fading , which appears as a large increase in the emission - line equivalent width for lines formed in the optically thin sn ejecta and shocked shell .",
    "the evolution of the h@xmath3 equivalent width is discussed below .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] shows the total h@xmath3 emission equivalent width ( ew ) for sn  2009ip , for the lbv - like progenitor variability and for the 2012 event itself ( plotted in two sections with different scales on the time axis , but the same ew scale ) .",
    "this is the total h@xmath3 ew , measured as the ratio of the excess emission line flux to the adjacent continuum flux density at high velocities on either side of h@xmath3 ( the broad absorption present in the line acts to slightly weaken the ew measured this way ) .",
    "we supplemented our pre - sn spectra with spectra of sn  2009ip from pastorello et al .",
    "( 2013 ; kindly provided by a. pastorello ) , some of which are also available on the wiserep database .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in the ew measurements comes from the noise in the faint continuum level ; we conservatively adopt error bars of @xmath1720% in the ew measurements plotted in figure  [ fig : ew ] .    during the @xmath13 yr of pre - sn evolution ,",
    "the ew varies but was typically several 10@xmath31  , which is consistent with known lbvs .",
    "the strongest h@xmath3 ew measured for an lbv is for @xmath8  car , with a variable ew of typically 400800   ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ; stahl et al .",
    "other lbvs typically have weaker h@xmath3 ( 100 - 200  ) because of their weaker winds compared to @xmath8 car .        however , starting with the 2012 explosion , the h@xmath3 ew of sn  2009ip took on very different and divergent behavior . at the time of its rapid",
    "brightening just after day 0 in figure  [ fig : phot ] , the ew ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] ) dropped substantially due to the added high continuum luminosity from optically thick csm interaction .",
    "as the continuum luminosity faded , however , the h@xmath3 emission ew rose sharply to a very high value at late times .",
    "the ew has now risen to above 4000  , 100 times higher than has ever been seen in any lbv - like star ; this rise is very typical of sne  iin ( smith et al.2008 , 2009b , 2010b ) .",
    "one reason that the h@xmath3 ew is so physically significant is because in an lbv , the h@xmath3 emission traces a radiatively driven wind , which in turn requires a strong uv / optical continuum luminosity source to drive the wind  on the other hand , a shock plowing into csm can produce strong h@xmath3 but requires no continuum luminosity to push it .",
    "this is an important point .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] shows the time evolution of h@xmath3 ew for other classic well - studied sne  iin measured the same way , including sn  1988z , sn  1998s , sn  1994w , sn  1997cy , sn  2005ip , and sn  2006tf ( these were originally compiled by smith et al .",
    "2008 , 2010b ) . in general , sne that have lower",
    "peak luminosities have stronger h@xmath3 equivalent width , but in all cases shown here of sne  iin dominated by prompt csm interaction luminosity , the h@xmath3 ew displays the same basic rising evolution with time . since most sne  iin are discovered near peak luminosity , we can not compare the pre - sn ew evolution of sn  2009ip to other sne iin  but from peak luminosity onward , sn  2009ip is entirely consistent with other normal sne  iin .",
    "the ew evolution of sn  2009ip most closely resembles that of sn  1998s , but is quite similar to sn  1988z and sn  2005ip as well .",
    "the rising ew is understood simply as a result of the csm interaction region becoming more optically thin as the shell expands and becomes less dense , cooler , and more transparent .",
    "this causes the continuum luminosity to drop while the h@xmath3 line photons from the shock can more easily escape ( see smith et al .",
    "for this reason , the increasing h@xmath3 ew at late times is generally accompanied by a transformation from a lorentzian profile ( optically thick to electron scattering ) to a gaussian or irregularly shaped line profile in sne  iin . for our day 964 , 1024 , and 1136 spectra of sn  2010mc , we do not detect the continuum in our spectra , but measured upper limits to the continuum level provide a lower limit to the h@xmath3 ew of roughly @xmath326000  .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ fig : ew ] , although not at the proper time of 964 days since this would be far off the right of the plot .",
    "the ew lower limit seen in the late - time spectrum of sn  2010mc is consistent with extrapolating the rate of increase in the ew of sn  2009ip to much later times .",
    "this makes it seem likely that the ew of h@xmath3 in sn  2009ip may continue to rise slowly over the next few years .",
    "the 2012 explosion of sn  2009ip was undoubtedly one of the most interesting astronomical transient events in recent years .",

    "sn  2009ip 2012a/2012b was the true core - collapse explosion of an unstable lbv - like star .",
    "this simple hypothesis has a few key ingredients :    \\1 .",
    "sn  2009ip s 2012a event was a relatively faint core - collapse sn initially , which then brightened rapidly in the 2012b event due to csm interaction .",
    "we suggest that the sn itself was intrinsically faint ( at first ) due to a compact blue progenitor .",
    "this is discussed below .",
    "the main 2012b peak of sn  2009ip was then powered by sn / csm interaction , as the sn ejecta caught the dense csm ejected 1 - 3 yr earlier . in this hypothesis",
    ", the total radiated energy can be far less than 10@xmath0 ergs ( as is the case for all type  iin sne except for super - luminous sne  iin ) depending on the mass or aspherical geometry of the csm .",
    "the only strict requirement is that the total radiated energy can not _ exceed _ the explosion energy , but it can of course be much less than the available kinetic energy .    \\2 . in our preferred scenario ,",
    "the pre - sn mass loss of sn  2009ip was akin to that inferred for other sne  iin that require dense csm , the main difference being that the luminous precursor variability of sn  2009ip _ was actually observed_. other objects are typically only discovered near the time of peak luminosity , not 3 years before , and so they may have suffered similar precursor outbursts that evaded detection .",
    "erratic variability on short timecales could have a natural origin in nuclear flashes during o and ne burning , interactions with a companion in a binary system ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ; soker & kashi 2013 ; kashi et al .",
    "2013 ) due to an enlarged stellar radius during these phases , or both .",
    "these are not yet on a firm theoretical foundation , but the rise of instability in the few years before core collapse - during o and ne burning - provides a much more natural explanation ( see smith & arnett 2013 ) than invoking some other hypothetical and very extreme instability that occurs when the star is not yet approaching core collapse .    in the remaining subsections of our paper , we explore various considerations of the light curve and energy budget , other observed properties of sne  iin , and their consequences for the overall interpretation of the nature of sn  2009ip . we conclude that the evidence strongly indicates that sn  2009ip was a true core - collapse sn with csm interaction , as is typical of other sne  iin .",
    "the main reasons to doubt a true core collapse expressed so far have been : ( 1 ) the initially faint 2012a event , ( 2 ) the csm interaction energy budget that does not exceed 10@xmath4 ergs , and ( 3 ) the lack of obvious nebular - phase oxygen lines indicative of core collapse .",
    "below we demonstrate that each of these is invalid as an argument against the core - collapse hypothesis : the initial faintness of the 2012a is fully consistent with models of sne from blue supergiants , various aspects of the energy budget do in fact require 10@xmath0 ergs , and late - phase spectra are indeed comparable to those of sn  1987a .    , sn  2009ip is compared to observed @xmath10-band light curves of sn  2010jp and sn  1987a , both of which were initially faint relative to normal sne ii - p .",

    "( 1988 ; red ) , arnett & fu ( 1989 ; orange ) , and young ( 2004 ; green ) , as discussed in the text.,width=297 ]      much of the controversy over the nature of sn  2009ip started during the 2012a event , when it began to fade after the first report of broad sn - like emission lines in the spectrum ( smith & mauerhan 2012a ) . the fading initially led some ( martin et al .",
    "2012 ; margutti et al .",
    "2012a , 2012b ) to suggest that it was not a sn after all .",
    "this controversy continued after the subsequent rapid rise in the 2012b event .",
    "the light curve of sn  2009ip s `` main event '' is shown in detail in figure  [ fig : models ] , and is discussed below .",
    "although the initial faintness of sn  2009ip in 2012a ( with a peak absolute magnitude of about @xmath615 ) may have been surprising , it should not have been .",
    "sn  1987a made it well known that the initial luminosity of a type ii sn explosion depends primarily on the progenitor star s radius , and the effect of initial radius on the light curve has been explored numerically ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "1988 ; arnett & fu 1989 ; young 2004 ; kasen & woosley 2009 ; dessart et al .",
    "2013 ) . with a smaller initial radius ,",
    "more thermal energy is lost to adiabatic expansion before the ejecta can radiate .",
    "this is why a normal sn  ii",
    "- p from a large red supergiant has a higher initial plateau luminosity than a sn from a more compact blue supergiant , for the same explosion energy and h envelope mass . since the progenitor of sn  2009ip",
    "was thought to be an lbv - like star with a radius similar to a blue supergiant , a relatively faint luminosity at early times should have been expected .    a complicating aspect that may have caused confusion was the initial fading of sn  2009ip from its 2012a peak ( during days @xmath620 to 0 in figure  [ fig : models ] ) , producing a `` valley '' before the rapid rise to peak in 2012b .",
    "although the luminosity of sn  1987a was almost identical to that of sn  2009ip from times soon after explosion to the 2012a peak , this subsequent `` valley '' was not present in sn  1987a .",
    "it is perhaps somewhat ironic or even amusing , then , to recall that this valley was actually predicted in models for sn  1987a s light curve  in fact , the observed absence of the valley was initially quite puzzling for the case of sn  1987a . in models discussed by woosley et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , for example , the valley at 20 - 40 days after explosion is a straightforward prediction .",
    "the initially faint peak is the h recombination plateau due to shock - deposited energy , whereas a second brighter peak follows when trapped energy deposited by radiactive decay is able to leak out 12 months afterward .",
    "one such model from woosley et al .",
    "( 1988 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : models ] , labeled as model 10h with a synthesized @xmath5ni mass of 0.07 @xmath9 .",
    "this model actually gives an excellent match to sn  2009ip with two exceptions :",
    "( 1 ) it does not include csm interaction that poweres the main 2012b peak , and ( 2 ) it has a higher @xmath5ni mass and more luminous radioactive decay tail than in sn  2009ip .",
    "maybe it is just a coincidence , but model 10h from woosley et al.even shows a narrow peak at 45 days ( @xmath190 days after explosion ) , at which time sn  2009ip had a small bump during its decline from the 2012b peak .",
    "a similar model from arnett & fu ( 1989 ) also shows this ( orange dot - dashed curve in figure  [ fig : models ] ) in the second radioactivity peak .",
    "this coincides with the time when strong broad p cygni lines returned to sn  2009ip s spectrum ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ) , suggesting that the underlying sn photosphere was once again contributing a large fraction of the luminosity .",
    "the reason we are somewhat hesitant to declare victory in this explanation of the day 45 bump is that the time of this peak in the radioactivity powered light curve is sensitive to several factors such as the overall @xmath5ni mass , the h envelope mass , explosion energy , mixing , etc .",
    "different models with somewhat different parameters ( young 2004 ) , still show qualitatively the same double - peaked light curve for a blue supergiant sn , but the time of the radioactive peak is shifted slightly : models `` y1 '' and `` y2 '' in figure  [ fig : models ] are very similar but for a factor of 2 difference in explosion energy and synthesized @xmath5ni mass .",
    "( note that all the models plotted in figure  [ fig : models ] are for the calculated _ bolometric _ luminosity , whereas the observed sn light curves are shown as @xmath10 band .",
    "thus , the reader should ignore the very brief few day initial peak following shock breakout , which is present because of an initially high temperature , and is not so prominent in red light . )",
    "why , then , did sn  1987a not have this valley after an initially faint recombination plateau ?",
    "woosley et al .  discussed a number of possible physical mechanisms to erase the valley , but perhaps the most compelling is mixing ( see also arnett & fu 1989 ) . for a relatively large synthesized @xmath5ni mass , as in sn  1987a , the energy deposited by radioactivity becomes dynamically important , leading to a density inversion that may drive rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the expanding ejecta .",
    "this , in turn , will instigate the mixing of @xmath5ni further into the envelope , causing radioactive heating to be deposited over a larger radius , and to therefore leak out earlier and smooth - out or even erase the valley . in effect , mixing causes the initial recombination plateau and the radioactivity peak to blend together . incorporating this effect , woosley et al .",
    "were able to modify model 10h to provide a good match to sn  1987a s light curve , and arnett & fu ( 1989 ) achieved similar results with an analytic light curve .",
    "judging by the late - time luminosity at 90 - 200 days , sn  2009ip had a synthesized @xmath5ni mass reduced by about a factor of 2 or more relative to sn  1987a .",
    "so with all the same explosion parameters but with roughly 1/2 the @xmath5ni mass , we would expect a fainter second peak powered by radioactive decay , and perhaps also less efficient mixing of @xmath5ni into the envelope , both of which would act to enhance the valley .",
    "another influential factor would be the he core mass  if sn  2009ip was a more massive progenitor star with a more massive he core than sn  1987a , the massive he core could decelerate the expansion of the @xmath5ni - rich ejecta , preventing them from being mixed further out into the h envelope , and thus delaying the rise of the second radioactivity powered peak .    continuing with this line of reasoning , for even lower @xmath5ni masses , the second radioactivity powered peak should be even less luminous , whereas the initial faint recombination plateau could be the same for a similar h envelope mass and stellar radius . for only 10% of the @xmath5ni mass of sn",
    "2009ip , it seems intuitively reasonable to expect that the second peak might not be a peak at all , but could just appear as an extension of the plateau or a slowed decline",
    ". this may be the explanation for sn  2010jp ( shown in blue in figure  [ fig : models ] ) , for which the @xmath5ni mass was inferred to be 0.003 @xmath9 or less ( smith et al .",
    "for extremely low or zero @xmath5ni mass , the light curve would simply plummet after @xmath140 days , although the initial recombination plateau would be the same if other parameters are held constant .",
    "another model from woosley et al .",
    "( 1988 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : models ] ; this is very similar to the model 10h discussed above , but with the synthesized @xmath5ni mass artificially set to zero .",
    "note that this faint peak is for a true core - collapse sn explosion with 10@xmath0 of ejecta kinetic energy , not a weak or failed sn .",
    "thus , by comparison with published model light curves intended for sn  1987a , we see that a 10@xmath0 erg core - collapse explosion of a blue supergiant gives a self - consistent explanation for the light curve of sn  2009ip , if we admit that the 2012b peak is primarily powered by csm interaction .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed spectral evolution that exhibited 4 main phases : ( 1 ) the initial faint 2012a peak was dominated by broad p cygni lines characteristic of a recombination plateau photosphere , ( 2 ) the 2012b peak was dominated by a hot blackbody and narrow emission lines as is typically seen in sne iin with strong csm interaction , ( 3 ) the fading after the 2012b peak was once again dominated by broad lines from the underlying fast sn ejecta that are reheated by radioactivity , and ( 4 ) the late - phase luminosity is due to a combination of a fading radioactive decay tail and lingering csm interaction .",
    "of course , superposed narrow nebular lines are always seen in the spectrum due to photoionized csm ahead of the shock .",
    "comparison with models mentioned above suggest that , for an explosion kinetic energy of 10@xmath0 ergs , the luminosity and duration of the 2012a peak indicate a hydrogen envelope mass of roughly 10 @xmath9 and a progenitor radius of ( 3 - 5)@xmath1110@xmath34 cm ( @xmath160 @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is appropriate for the inferred lbv - like status of the progenitor ( smith et al.2010b ) .",
    "for example , the stellar radius of @xmath8  carinae inferred from models of the present - day spectrum is about 60 - 100 @xmath2 ( hillier et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "one last point to mention is that the similar initial faint peaks of sn  2009ip and sn  2010jp may have an interesting connection to low metallicity .",
    "both objects are consistent with a very similar explosion from a relatively compact blue supergiant star , except that sn  2009ip had a larger @xmath5ni mass and stronger pre - sn outbursts that led to stronger csm interaction and higher luminosity .",
    "sn  2010jp was a type  iin with csm interaction , but not strong enough to enhance the luminosity , and it had evidence for a fast bipolar jet that may have been related to the lower @xmath5ni mass if fallback to black hole was involved .",
    "the possible connection to low metallicity is that both sne exploded in extremely remote environments in the far outskirts of their host spiral galaxies ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ; fraser et al .",
    "2013a ; margutti et al .",
    "2013 ; smith et al .",
    "sn  2010mc was also found in a presumably low - metallicity dwarf galaxy ( figure  [ fig : img ] ) , and sn  1987a exploded in the moderately metal - poor lmc .",
    "arnett et al .",
    "( 1989 ) have reviewed reasons why explosions of blue supergiant progenitors might be relatively more common in lower - metallicity regions .",
    "another key component in the debate about the nature of sn  2009ip ( true sn or not ? ) is that , in principle , a high explosion energy of 10@xmath0 erg is not necessarily required to produce a bright sn - like display .",
    "this is because csm interaction can be an extremely efficient engine for converting ejecta kinetic energy into radiated energy ; this same mechanism allows super - luminous sne to radiate 100 times more light than a normal sn with the same explosion kinetic energy ( e.g. , smith & mccray ) . both woosley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and dessart et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have pointed out that a true core - collapse sn is not necessarily required to produce a sn - like transient ; even explosions of 10@xmath4 ergs can achieve peak luminosities like sne without any radioactive decay luminosity .",
    "a similar line of reasoning allows a low - energy electron - capture explosion to produce a bright sn , as in the case of the crab nebula and sn  1054 ( smith 2013b ) . this same argument has been extended to sn  2009ip s 2012 event , advocating that sn  2009ip was a ppi ejection or some other non - sn event ( pastorello et al",
    ".  2013 ; fraser et al .  2013a ; margutti et al.2013 ) .",
    "these authors find that only 10@xmath4 erg is required to produce the observed radiated energy , not 10@xmath0 ergs .",
    "this is , however , only part of the story .",
    "two points about the energy budget are essential to mention : first , a low radiated energy of only @xmath13@xmath1110@xmath35 ergs ( margutti et al .",
    "2013 ) does not provide evidence against the sn hypothesis .",
    "normal core - collapse sne typically radiate only 10@xmath35 ergs or less ( arnett 1996 ) .",
    "this is because most of the 10@xmath0 ergs of explosion energy ( excluding neutrinos ) gets converted to kinetic energy through adiabatic expansion , which is even more severe for relatively compact blue supergiants . only through csm interaction",
    "does some fraction of this energy get converted back to radiation .",
    "second , even with intense csm interaction , the total radiated energy can still be far less than the ejecta kinetic energy .",
    "the explosion kinetic energy required to power csm interaction is merely _ a lower limit _ , involving only the portion of the ejecta that participate in the shock interaction .",
    "the efficiency of converting kinetic energy into radiation can be high ( i.e. 50% or more ) if conditions are right ( high mass and slow csm , fast sn ejecta , spherical symmetry ) , but the efficiency can be far less .",
    "asymmetry is an essential consideration ( perhaps the most important one ) in the energy budget from csm interaction ( see figure  [ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "we have mentioned the persistent broad lines in the spectrum earlier in this paper in the context of the long diffusion time and high optical depths in high speed ejecta at late times , basically ruling out a low - mass / low - energy shell ejection because a 10@xmath0 erg explosion is required by a few @xmath9 moving at 8000 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the persistence of these broad lines is also directly relevant to the asymmetry of the explosion and the energy budget .",
    "since we still see broad h@xmath3 emission lines with widths of 8000 km s@xmath7 , long after the most intense phase of csm interaction has ended , the ejecta were not decelerated  thus , significant large - scale asymmetry is a strict requirement .",
    "if sn  2009ip were spherically symmetric , any ejecta faster than @xmath12000 km s@xmath7 would have crashed into the reverse shock during the peak of the 2012b event . in other words , at day 60 , the 8000 km s@xmath7 ejecta should reach @xmath10=4@xmath1110@xmath29 cm , larger than the effective blackbody radius of @xmath36=1.5@xmath1110@xmath29 cm deduced by margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) around this time assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the broad lines persist until late times , so a substantial fraction of the fast ejecta must never interact with the slow ( @xmath1600",
    "km s@xmath7 ) csm , requiring that large sections of the explosion s solid angle do not participate in csm interaction during the 2012b peak . since 10@xmath4 ergs was the amount of kinetic energy required to fuel the _ observed _ csm interaction luminosity , the true explosion kinetic energy must be substantially higher .",
    "if the csm is located in a thin disk or ring , as proposed by some authors for a number of other sne  iin like sn  1998s ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ) and sn  1997eg ( hoffman et al .",
    "2008 ) , then the true explosion energy could easily be 10 times higher than the 10@xmath4 ergs inferred from the minimum requirements of csm interaction .",
    "for example , if the csm is in a disk with an opening angle of 10@xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath175@xmath37 from the equatorial plane ) , then this disk will intercept less than 9% of the sn ejecta s solid angle .",
    "more than 90% of the fast sn ejecta will expand unhindered , and will simply cool and fade without any mechanism to reheat them ( figure  [ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "in fact , several authors have inferred a significantly asymmetric csm environment for sn  2009ip , including an equatorial disk - like distribution of the csm ( levesque et al .",
    "2013 ; margutti et al.2013 ) .",
    "no observations of the polarization of sn  2009ip have been published yet , but these may prove to be quite interesting to test the strong asymmetry we infer for csm - interaction in the 2012b event .",
    "one could imagine that the asymmetry of the csm is one of the driving agents to explain the overall diversity among sne  iin .",
    "the highest luminosity events like the super - luminous sne require a large csm mass to decelerate the sn ejecta , but to achieve the radiated energy budget without appealing to extraordinarily energetic explosions they also require that the csm is opaque over most of the solid angle surrounding the explosion .",
    "sne  iin of more moderate luminosity can result from the same explosion energy if the csm intercepts a smaller fraction of the solid angle of the explosion , converting a smaller fraction of their available kinetic energy into radiation at early times ( figure  [ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that many of the moderate - luminosity sne  iin also show an underlying broad - line component in their spectra , indicating that some of the sn ejecta expand without colliding with the slow csm .      a third argument put forward in favor of a non - sn interpretation for sn  2009ip was that its late - time spectrum does not show a nebular phase like normal core - collapse sne , and especially that it does not show the bright oxygen lines ( i.e. [ o  i ] @xmath386300,6464 ) seen in other sne ( fraser et al .  2013a , 2013b )",
    "this disregards the fact that the late - time emission of sne  iin is often dominated by csm interaction , and not by the usual nebular phase powered by the slow leakage of radioactive energy .",
    "it also ignores possible complications due to lower @xmath5ni mass and external irradiation of the sn ejecta by csm interaction luminosity .",
    "in fact , sne  iin rarely exhibit a classical nebular phase with a clear radioactive decay tail because it is masked by strong ongoing csm interaction .",
    "fraser et al .  (",
    "2013a ) also claim that sn  2009ip fades at a rate inconsistent with radioactive decay , and they find no significant ir excess from dust .",
    "both of these are in disagreement with observations reported by us and by other authors ( margutti et al .",
    "2013 ; smith et al .  2013 ; this work ) .",
    "within observational uncertainties , sn  2009ip faded at a rate entirely consistent with radioactive decay during days 100 - 200 ( figures  [ fig : phot ] and [ fig : models ] ) . from this",
    "we estimate an upper limit of 0.04 @xmath9 for the mass of synthesized @xmath5ni .",
    "the @xmath5ni mass may , however , be even lower if more of the luminosity comes from csm interaction , or it may be somewhat higher if dust causes extinction .",
    "the light curve appears to flatten after day 200 , fading more slowly than radioactive decay as the emergent light is once again dominated by ongoing csm interaction , as in most sne  iin .",
    "therefore , the most promising time to see evidence of a radioactivity - powered nebular phase is during days 100 - 200 . after this , the nebular spectrum becomes more and more difficult to see , as it contributes an ever decreasing fraction of the observed luminosity .",
    "it is therefore quite interesting that our day 190 - 200 spectra of sn  2009ip are matched surprisingly well by observed spectra of sn  1987a at around the same time ( day 152 ) , neglecting the stronger narrow components in sn  2009ip that are due to external csm interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : l8spec ] includes a direct comparison of late - time spectra of sn  2009ip and sn  1987a . at this epoch , the overall shape of the continuum and the strength of the broad lines of he  i , h@xmath3 , and ca  ii are similar in both objects .",
    "more to the point , we note that the broad line around 7300   is indeed clearly detected in sn  2009ip , and has the same strength and line profile in both objects ; this is probably [ ca  ii ] commonly seen in nebular spectra of sne .",
    "it is true that [ o  i ] @xmath386300,6364 does not appear to be detected in our day 196 spectrum of sn  2009ip , but this line is not very strong in sn  1987a either ( figure  [ fig : l8spec ] ) .",
    "also , the [ o  i ] line strength can vary from one core - collapse sn to the next ; in sn  1999em , for example , [ o  i ] @xmath246300 was very weak in the day 316 spectrum ( leonard et al .  2002 ) , with a strength that would not be detected in our spectra of sn  2009ip . moreover , the first ionization potential of oxygen is the same as hydrogen .",
    "since csm interaction gives rise to extremely strong h@xmath3 emission , it may be possible that lyman continuum photons generated in the csm interaction shock may propagate back into the sn ejecta and ionize oxygen atoms , perhaps quashing the strength of [ o  i ] lines .",
    "this last idea is speculative in the absence of detailed radiative transfer calculations , but the point is that we should not necessarily expect the nebular phase of a sn  iin to have exactly the same properties as normal sne ii - p , where the only source of heating is internal radioactive decay .",
    "fraser et al .  ( 2013b ) claimed that the lack of evidence for nucleosynthetic products in the late spectrum of sn  2009ip argues against a core - collapse interpretation , but the comparison to sn  1987a contradicts this claim . aside from [ o   i ] , which may be affected by photoionization , there is no other strong line in the spectrum of sn  1987a that should have been detected in sn  2009ip at a similar epoch ( i.e. except for [ o  i ] , the sn  1987a spectrum is always at or below the observed day 193 spectrum of sn  2009ip in figure  [ fig : l8spec ] ) .    at even later times , it becomes increasingly difficult to see clear signatures of the nebular phase in spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : l8spec ] also compares the day 286 and day 339 spectra of sn  2009ip to a similar epoch ( day 293 ) of sn  1987a .",
    "the spectrum of sn  2009ip at this late phase is more strongly influenced by csm interaction , judging by the blue pseudo continuum and stronger narrow emission lines that are present in late - phase spectra of well - studied sne  iin like sn  1988z ( chugai & danziger 1994 ) and sn  2005ip ( smith et al.2009b ) , as well as in a late - time spectrum of sn  2006tf ( also plotted in figure  [ fig : l8spec ] ) . since the strong 7300 ",
    "feature is completely absent in the csm - interation dominated spectrum of sn  2006tf on day 445 , we may infer that its strong presence in sn  2009ip ( and sn  1987a ) is primarily due to the nebular - phase emission from the inner ejecta .",
    "the strength and profile of this line , as well as the ca  ii ir triplet and the underlying broad wings of h@xmath3 , are still similar in sn  2009ip and sn  1987a in these latest epochs .",
    "the [ o  i ] emission is still missing in sn  2009ip , perhaps for the reasons noted above , but it only needs to be weaker by a factor of 2 - 3 to go undetected in sn  2009ip . as noted above , however , this [ o  i ] line is similarly weak in late spectra of the classic sn  ii - p 1999em .",
    "if the fading rate of sn  2009ip continues at its present level , we would expect that the underlying nebular lines would become progressively more difficult to see , and that the spectrum will more closely resemble the late spectrum of sn  2006tf .",
    "one future prospect is that lines normally seen in nebular phases ( like oxygen lines ) may become observable again in the future if / when the oxygen - rich inner layers crash into the reverse shock .",
    "this may take several years , but predicting when it will occur is difficult .",
    "an unusually massive he core ( if sn  2009ip had a very massive progenitor star ) could decelerate the expansion of inner layers that are rich in oxygen and other nucleosynthetic products , potentially delaying the time when they finally participate in csm interaction . while these o lines are seen at very late times in some sne  iin , such as sn  1998s ( mauerhan & smith 2012 ) , other well - studied sne  iin",
    "have not shown them ( i.e. , sn  2006tf , sn  2006gy , sn  2005ip ; smith et al.2008 , 2009b , 2010a ) .      in comparing sn  2009ip to other examples of sn explosions , and especially to the wider class of type  iin sne , it is essential to remember that the quality and quantity of pre - sn observations for this source are unprecedented .",
    "although the behavior of sn  2009ip in its 2012a event seems to be unusual at first glance , we can not claim with any confidence that this is unique or unusual behavior among sne  iin .",
    "except for pre - peak photometry of sn  2010mc ( no early spectra are available ) , this information does not exist for other sne  iin .",
    "in fact , all sne  iin require some sort of episodic pre - sn mass loss . for any sn",
    "iin , the csm mass that must be ejected in a short amount of time would require extremely high mass - loss rates that can not be provided by normal stellar winds ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "the least extreme mass loss among sne iin progenitors is comparable to the episodic winds seen in only the most extreme red supergiants like vy cma , with mass - loss rates of order 10@xmath39 @xmath9 yr@xmath7 ( smith et al .  2009a , 2009b ) .",
    "normal sne  iin require mass - loss rates of order 0.1 @xmath9 yr@xmath7 ( kiewe et al .  2010 ;",
    "gal - yam et al .  2007 ; chugai et al .",
    "2004 ) , only seen previously in giant eruptions of lbvs , while the more luminous sne  iin require mass loss events comparable to @xmath8 car s extreme 19th century eruption ( smith & mccray 2007 ; smith et al .",
    "to make a sn  iin at times soon after explosion , this dense csm must be ejected in a time period of only a few years before core collapse .",
    "thus , all sne  iin must do _ something _ akin to what was observed in sn  2009ip .",
    "the reason that sn  2009ip appears to be alone ( or almost alone ; sn  2010mc ) probably has more to do with detection limits than sn  2009ip being physically unusual . recall that most sne  iin are discovered near the time of maximum luminosity or shortly afterward , using relatively small telescopes that would not be sensitive to lbv - like eruption luminosities at distances larger than about 30 mpc .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to a comparison of the data from the time of sn  2009ip s peak luminosity onward , then there is no indication that sn  2009ip is significantly divergent compared to the existing sample of sne  iin with similar peak luminosities .",
    "lsst will likely provide much more valuable constraints on the variability of sn  iin progenitors .",
    "regardless of the larger class of sne  iin , it is clear that sn  2009ip and sn  2010mc are near twins , at least during their early - time evolution . therefore , with a longer time baseline since its explosion , sn  2010mc may provide us with a preview of coming attractions for sn  2009ip .",
    "basically , in the 2 - 3 years after its sn event , sn  2010mc has exhibited no resurgence of erratic lbv - like variability , it has not had another ppi eruption , and it has not returned to a luminous lbv - like state as we expect for a surviving star . instead , it has continued to fade and exhibits no detectable continuum ; the late - time spectrum shows only h@xmath3 emission , consistent with a shock running into more distant csm as in other old sne  iin .",
    "the h@xmath3 equivalent width is over 6000   at the latest phases , more than 2 orders of magnitude stronger than in any stellar wind .",
    "its level of late - time csm interaction appears to be typical of known core - collapse sne iin , comfortably intermediate between sn  1998s and sn  2005ip ( figure  [ fig : phot ] ) .      to provide a powerful explosion that could be as luminous as a typical sn , the only non - terminal alternative to a real sn proposed so far is the ppi ( e.g. , heger & woosley 2002 ; woosley et al.2007 ) .",
    "erg explosion , and these can produce luminous transients with peak luminosity comparable to bright sne if they have csm interaction ( smith 2013b ; mauerhan et al .",
    "2013b ) , but this is a true terminal sn event that undergoes core collapse to yield a neutron star .",
    "] however , the ppi does not provide a very suitable explanation for sn  2009ip , and is unsatisfactory in the sense that its low rate of occurance would require sn  2009ip to be different from all other sne  iin .",
    "there are a number of problems with invoking the ppi to explain sn  2009ip . as noted by ofek et al .",
    "( 2013a , 2013b ) , the ppi predicts a much larger mass of ejecta ( several @xmath9 ) than has been inferred for the precursor events or the main 2012 event of sn  2009ip ( @xmath10.1 @xmath9 ) in the non - terminal csm interaction models proposed ( pastorello et al .  2013 ;",
    "fraser et al .",
    "2013a ; margutti et al .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned by margutti et al.(2013 ) , the ppi predicts a very wide range of timescales for the pre - sn pulses . in order for",
    "sn  2009ip and sn  2010mc to have identical @xmath140 day timescales within the wide range of possible timescales would require rather extreme fine tuning , making this hypothesis seem highly improbable.1 yr to @xmath140 days might imply that even if the shell ejections were caused by ppi , that the star would have collapsed to a black hole by now anyway .",
    "thus , the ppi leaves us with a scenario that is difficult to distinguish from a true sn , since both would leave behind a compact corpse and no star . the only significant predicted difference between a true sn and the ppi would be @xmath5ni production ( which should be absent in the ppi scenario ) , but this is also difficult to test in sn  iin due to late - time csm interaction . ]    another argument against the ppi being the explanation for sn  2009ip is based on statistics .",
    "type  iin sne comprise 8 - 9% of all observed core - collapse sne occurring in spiral galaxies ( smith et al .",
    ". some of these may actually be sne  ia with csm ( see e.g. , silverman et al .",
    "2013 ) and some may be ecsne ( mauerhan et al .  2013b ; smith 2013b ) .",
    "even so , a substantial fraction of sne  iin are `` normal '' sne  iin from massive lbv - like stars or extreme red supergiants .",
    "the ppi can not explain the class of sne  iin as a whole ( or even half of it ) because the ppi occurs in a narrow mass range for very rare , very massive stars , such that ppi events must be far too infrequent to explain observed sne  iin . for a normal salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , the ppi mass range ( initial masses of roughly 100 - 130 @xmath9 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) would contribute less than about 1% of all exploding stars above 8.5 @xmath9 ( see smith et al.2011b ) .",
    "statistics aside , it seems unlikely that the detected progenitor of sn  2009ip is luminous enough to be in this mass range ( smith et al .  2010b ; foley et al .  2011 ; margutti et al .",
    "2013 ) . to make matters worse , though",
    ", this quoted ppi mass range is for zero metallicity ; for nearly solar metallicity with mass loss , the mass range would need to move to higher ( and therefore rarer ) initial masses ( see , however , chatzopoulos & wheeler 2012 ) . to propose that sn  2009ip is not a sn and",
    "instead a ppi eruption would require that it be unique among the rest of the nearby sn  iin population , which is currently an unjustifiable claim based on available data .",
    "so , if sn  2009ip was nt a ppi eruption , then what was it ? what other mechanism can produce significant eruptive mass loss that precedes an even more extreme non - terminal explosive event ?",
    "no other non - terminal mechanism has yet been identified . without an answer to this ,",
    "there is little motivation to further consider a non - sn hypothesis for sn  2009ip .",
    "the nearly identical light curves of sn  2009ip and sn  2010mc demand an answer to the question of why these two different objects would have such similar time evolution .",
    "this makes it seem unlikely that a binary merger is the explanation ( soker & kashi 2013 ; kashi et al.2013 ) , since both sn  2010mc and sn  2009ip need to be tuned to the same orbital period .",
    "margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) highlighted the fact that both sn  2009ip and sn  2010mc share a @xmath140 day delay between the two outbursts , and that this must be an important clue to their underlying nature , but those authors left the question unanswered .",
    "indeed , under the hypothesis that the 2012a and 2012b events are two separate and sequential non - sn explosions ( margutti et al .",
    "2013 ) , this identical timescale in two different objects would require extreme and unlikely fine tuning , as those authors noted .    however , under the hypothesis we advocate , wherein the 2012a event was the true sn explosion and the 2012b event was csm interaction ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ) , the timescale of 40 days is simply the amount of time required for the fast sn ejecta to catch up to the expanding csm shell ejected 1 - 2 yr earlier .",
    "if the csm was ejected at a speed of @xmath11000 km s@xmath7 and the sn ejecta expand 10 times faster at 10,000 km s@xmath7 , then the time needed for the fast sn ejecta to catch the slower csm ejected @xmath11 yr earlier is simply 1 yr @xmath11 ( @xmath40/@xmath41 ) @xmath20 37 days .",
    "this is roughly the correct delay time . in that case , the similar @xmath140 day delay between the two sequential outbursts in both sn  2009ip and sn  2010mc is set by the @xmath11 yr timescale of the precursor mass ejections .",
    "thus , we seek a common origin for substantial changes in stellar structure on timescales of @xmath11 yr before a powerful explosion .",
    "the very last phases of pre - sn nuclear burning in the core of a massive star may provide a natural explanation for the erratic variability of sn  2009ip in the few years leading up to its 2012 demise .",
    "in particular , o and ne burning each last for a time of order 1 yr .",
    "c burning occurs on a timescale that is too long ( @xmath110@xmath30 yr ) for sn  2009ip s behavior , and si burning is too quick ( days ) .",
    "quataert & shiode ( 2012 ) have suggested that the rapid burning rate during o and ne burning and a star s response to extreme neutrino losses may excite waves that propagate through the envelope , perhaps leading to enhanced mass loss on a short timescale before core collapse .",
    "alternatively , multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the shell burning layers during o burning and later phases reveal potential eruptive instabilities ( meakin & arnett 2007 ; arnett & meakin 2011 ) .",
    "these instabilities might also help instigate mixing and perhaps explosive burning , depositing energy into the core that might lead to hydrodynamic mass ejection ( e.g. , dessart et al .",
    "2010 ; smith & arnett 2013 ) . although these mechanisms require a great deal of additional study , the possibility of disruptive instabilities arising on the correct timescale before core collapse is intriguing ( see smith & arnett 2013 for a more extensive discussion , including the possible outcomes in a close binary system ) .    in the alternative scenario where sn  2009ip is not a core - collapse sn , on the other hand",
    ", there is no clear physical motivation for the rapid and accelerating evolution of the instability on timescales of only 1 yr .",
    "it is also unclear why these would immediately precede a much more catastrophic ( but also non - terminal ) event that involves an explosion with a significant fraction of the core binding energy .",
    "finally , it is worth recalling an obvious fact . in the past several decades",
    ", astronomers have found dozens of sne  iin at relatively nearby distances ( within @xmath150 mpc ) , and a number of other unusual sn - like transients .",
    "so far , among objects with a peak absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath616 , not one in history has ever had a resurgence as another violent explosion .",
    "this contradicts expectations of the ppi hypothesis .",
    "the simplest and most conservative conjecture is that these stars have indeed met their demise in a final sn event , at least until strong evidence to the contrary surfaces .",

    "we thank n.  morrell for assistance in obtaining some of the data from las campanas , and we thank a.  pastorello for sharing spectroscopic observations of sn  2009ip that contributed to our measurements of the equivalent width in figure  [ fig : ew ] .",
