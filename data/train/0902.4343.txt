    "entanglement plays an important role in modern physics and is the subject of intense research both for its implications in our fundamental understanding of nature @xcite as well as its practical usefulness in quantum information processing @xcite and @xcite .",
    "different models of quantum computing have been devised to harness this usefulness .",
    "the most prominent ones include the circuit model @xcite , topological computing @xcite and measurement - based computing @xcite .",
    "measurement - based quantum computation ( or one - way quantum computation ) differs from the circuit model by using an initially prepared highly entangled resource state .",
    "the algorithm proceeds as a set of local measurements on this state .",
    "the basis and order of these measurements characterize the algorithm and outcomes of previous measurements are fed forward to make the computation deterministic .",
    "the general resource for this computation model are graph states @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on particular graph states , namely cluster states @xcite . unlike graph states , cluster states have regular square structure .",
    "one of the advantages of one - way quantum computation is that all the entanglement used in the algorithm is present right at the beginning .",
    "the subsequent measurements only consume it .",
    "this makes it easier to identify the role of entanglement in the information processing compared to the traditional circuit model .",
    "recently it has also been shown both theoretically and experimentally in @xcite that the quantum computational power of cluster states can be extended by replacing some projective measurements with generalized quantum measurements .",
    "this makes cluster state quantum computation a very attractive and promising prospect when it comes to constructing a quantum computer .",
    "due to its clear role as a resource in one - way quantum computation it is highly desirable to know the entanglement properties of cluster states .",
    "perhaps one of the most important problems in studying the properties of quantum states , and resource states for quantum computation in particular , is the quantification of entanglement itself .",
    "the entanglement scaling of pure @xmath0-dimensional graph states has been shown by markham et al to be @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however any realistic quantum computer will operate at finite temperatures which makes it necessary to be able to characterize entanglement of mixed states .",
    "quantifying entanglement is a notoriously difficult task @xcite and the exact scaling of entanglement in thermal cluster states is still unknown though some advances have been made by investigating the localization of entanglement in noisy cluster states @xcite .",
    "there are many entanglement measures that quantify the scaling of entanglement in quantum states . in this work",
    "we use relative entropy of entanglement ( see @xcite and @xcite ) to quantify the scaling . in general",
    "there are not many multipartite quantum states for which the relative entropy of entnaglement can be calculated analytically .",
    "@xmath2-dimensional symmetric states are one of the few examples @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is unknown how to find the closest separable state to a general entangled state and the problem of closed form of relative entropy still remains an open question .",
    "though some progress has been made in this direction ( @xcite and @xcite ) it is impossible to do this even for a general two - qubit state .",
    "we present a method of constructing the closest separable state to a thermal cluster and show how it can reproduce the results of @xcite for pure cluster states .",
    "we also show how bound entanglement complicates the procedure of finding the closest separable state for noisy cluster states .",
    "the entanglement of cluster states is known to scale linearly with the size of the system as @xmath3 .",
    "this result was first obtained by markham et al in @xcite .",
    "the authors used a technique where they derived upper and lower bounds on the entanglement and then they showed that these two bounds are equal .    in this section",
    "we verify this result using geometrical ideas . to do this we employ the relative entropy of entanglement ( @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath4 defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the entangled state .",
    "the minimization is taken over the set @xmath7 of all separable states @xmath8 and @xmath9 $ ] is the relative entropy . for pure states",
    "this simplifies to @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "since we are considering only qubits we take the logarithm to base 2 .",
    "state that minimizes the relative entropy in ( [ eq : relative_entropy ] ) will be designated by @xmath11 and will be called the closest separable state . in order to prove that this state @xmath11 achieves the minimum of relative entropy we employ the same approach as @xcite .",
    "consider a small region around the closest separable state @xmath12 for a small parameter @xmath13 .",
    "all we have to show now is that for a general separable state @xmath14 the gradient of relative entropy is non - negative in this region .",
    "due to convexity of the set of separable states this will also mean that the minimum of relative entropy is global .",
    "a cluster state can be thought of as a state whose qubits are first prepared in the + 1 eigenstate of @xmath15 and then control - phase gates @xmath16 are applied between nearest neighbours . for example",
    "the two - qubit cluster state is @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "it can be easily seen that the closest separable state @xmath18 is @xmath19 by calculating that @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "so far all the states have been expressed in the computational basis @xmath22 .",
    "it is however more useful to write the states in what we call the `` mixed '' basis @xmath23 .",
    "so the state vector and the closest separable state for the case of 2 qubits now become @xmath24\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly for 4 qubits the expressions take the following form @xmath25\\\\ \\rho_{4}^{\\ast } & = & \\frac{1}{4}[|0 + 0+\\rangle\\langle0 + 0+|+|0 - 1-\\rangle\\langle0 - 1-|\\\\\\nonumber & & + |1 - 0+\\rangle\\langle1 - 0+|+|1 + 1-\\rangle\\langle1 + 1-|]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the form of @xmath18 and @xmath26 we can see that the closest separable state is obtainable from the state vector by writing the density matrix in the `` mixed '' basis and then keeping only the diagonal terms .",
    "this is why it is more instructive to work in the `` mixed '' basis , one can immediately see the form of the closest separable state from the state vector .",
    "of course in the computational basis not all off - diagonal terms are zero .",
    "important thing to notice is the number of terms in the state vector of a cluster state is different in the computational basis and in the `` mixed '' basis . in the computational basis all the coefficients are non - zero , they are either @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "so for @xmath29-qubit cluster state there are @xmath30 basis coefficients . on the other hand in the `` mixed '' basis",
    "the number of coefficients drops to @xmath31 .",
    "so when it comes to normalization coefficients for the density matrices we have    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the above it is clear to see that the closest separable matrix @xmath32 is of rank @xmath31 .",
    "another useful fact that will be used later is that when the matrices are expressed in the `` mixed '' basis it is easy to see that they commute with the cluster state @xmath33=0 $ ] .    before we start the proof for the closest separable state a small note about our notation is in place .",
    "the proof contains places where in stead of just writing @xmath34 or @xmath32 it is more instructive to write out the state explicitly , for instance for 2 qubits @xmath35 .",
    "this is of course not possible in the case of general @xmath29 .",
    "therefore we use the following notation .",
    "@xmath36 from the normalization factors it is clear that the states are in the `` mixed '' basis .",
    "this also implies that each round bracket contains @xmath31 terms .    as mentioned above , to prove that states of the form @xmath18 and @xmath26 are really the closest separable states we need to show that the gradient of relative entropy in a small region around @xmath32 is non - negative @xmath37 substituting @xmath38 and realizing that for a positive operator @xmath39 we have the expression @xmath40 condition ( [ eq : n_gradient_s ] ) becomes @xmath41\\geq 0\\ ] ] starting with the first integral in eq.([eq : n_gradient_f ] ) @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\textrm{tr}[\\sigma\\int_{0}^{\\infty}(\\rho_{n}^{\\ast}+t)^{-2}dt\\rho_{n}^{\\ast}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evaluating the integral in eq.([eq : first_int ] ) : @xmath43 substituting this back into eq.([eq : first_int ] ) : @xmath44&=&2^{n}[\\sigma*2^{-n}(| ... \\rangle\\langle ... |+ ... )*(| ... \\rangle\\langle ... |+ ... )]\\\\ & = & \\textrm{tr}[\\sigma(| ...",

    "we can look at the form of the closest separable state from a more operational point of view .",
    "imagine we are asked to prepare the closest separable state to an @xmath29-qubit one - dimensional cluster state .",
    "the only ingredients needed to construct this state are the 2-qubit closest separable state @xmath18 and control - phase gates @xmath16 .",
    "the state @xmath32 can be written @xmath73 where the unitary applied has the form @xmath74 all the unitary ( [ eq : unitary_cz ] ) implements are controlled phase gates @xmath16 between qubits 2 - 3 and 4 - 5 and so on .",
    "it connects the states @xmath18 together in a chain as shown in fig.([fig : n_separable_cz ] )",
    ".     qubits .",
    "each pair of qubits represents the closest separable state @xmath18 . ]",
    "it is important to notice that although control - phase gates are entangling operations , they leave the state @xmath32 in a separable form .",
    "this can easily be seen if we consider two separable 2-qubit states ( [ eq:2_closest ] ) joined by a control - phase operation .",
    "the total 4-qubit state can be written as @xmath75 .",
    "this state is locally equivalent to @xmath76 $ ] where we have applied hadamard operators on every second qubit @xmath77 .",
    "the transformed state @xmath26 is clearly separable . since identical analysis",
    "can be applied to @xmath32 we conclude that control - phase operations in the unitary ( [ eq : unitary_cz ] ) do not introduce any entanglement and @xmath32 remains separable .",
    "it is important to note that the form of the closest separable state is the same for cluster states in higher dimensions as well .",
    "the majority of the proof for closest separable states is independent of the dimension of our cluster state .",
    "the dimensionality becomes important only in eq.([eq : trace_proof ] ) where we assume one - dimensional cluster state by using @xmath59 where the control - phase gate is applied between qubits @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for higher dimensions the number of control - phase gates in eq.([eq : trace_proof ] ) increases due to larger number of neighbouring qubits .",
    "however the logic of the proof remains unchanged .",
    "therefore it is possible to find the closest separable state to a pure cluster state of any dimensionality .",
    "this is crucial because unlike linear cluster chains , two and higher dimensional clusters are universal resources for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "study of thermal entanglement is of great significance since any realistic scheme of implementing a quantum computer will operate at finite temperatures . in this section",
    "we look at entanglement in thermal cluster states .",
    "specifically we are interested to see at what temperature the cluster state becomes separable .",
    "these considerations will lead us to a more general form for the closest separable state .",
    "consider the cluster hamiltonian @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the coupling constant and @xmath80 is the neighbourhood of site @xmath81 .",
    "the terms in the sum above are just a particular case of stabilizer operators @xcite .",
    "hence hamiltonian ( [ eq : stabiliser_hamiltonian ] ) is also referred to as the stabilizer hamiltonian .",
    "the ground state of this hamiltonian is the cluster state .",
    "excited states are achieved by local @xmath82 flips .",
    "the ground state has energy @xmath83 and is non - degenerate .",
    "the @xmath84 excited state has energy @xmath85 with degeneracy @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "all the states in the spectrum of the hamiltonian are equally entangled since they are all some @xmath87 away from the ground state",
    ". therefore our method of finding the closest separable state can also be used on these excited states .",
    "the ground state of this hamiltonian is highly entangled and the entanglement scales linearly @xcite with the size of the cluster state as @xmath3 . an interesting question to ask is whether this entanglement persists at finite temperatures and where is the critical point beyond which the thermal entangled state becomes separable .",
    "thermal cluster state has the following form @xcite @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the stabilizer operator at site @xmath81 . for simplicity we will now consider a two - qubit thermal cluster state of the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "so in the low temperature limit as @xmath92 we recover the pure state because @xmath93 . as the temperature increases @xmath94 and",
    "for @xmath95 we obtain a maximally mixed state . to calculate the critical temperature at which the state becomes separable we use the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to see when the state fails to be a positive definite we have to solve the following equation @xmath96 .",
    "this equation has two solutions @xmath97 but we will disregard the negative solution because it is not physical . substituting this back into @xmath91",
    "finally gives us the critical temperature @xmath98 the entanglement for @xmath99 happens to be of useful distillable nature @xcite .",
    "therefore by using local operations and classical communication on multiple copies of the thermal cluster pure entanglement can be distilled .",
    "this critical temperature for distillable entanglement remains unchanged for higher dimensions and any system size @xmath29 as proved in @xcite . for temperatures above the critical temperature , @xmath100 , the @xmath29-qubit cluster state , where @xmath101 , is not fully separable but is bound entangled @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature at which all entanglement vanishes is non - trivial to find due to the fact that properties of bound entanglement are still not fully understood .",
    "we have already calculated the closest separable state for a 2-qubit cluster .",
    "now we will show that this state is not unique .",
    "in fact there are infinitely many states that satisfy condition ( [ eq : n_gradient_s ] ) .",
    "since there is no bound entanglement for the case of two qubits we know that the thermal cluster state at the critical temperature @xmath102 is fully separable .",
    "it is natural to ask the question what the distance is between this state and a pure cluster state in terms of the relative entropy .",
    "so we want to calculate @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    ". it can be quickly checked that @xmath106 and the gradient of relative entropy in a small region around @xmath107 is @xmath108>0 $ ] as can be seen from eq.([eq:2_4_6_trace ] ) .",
    "therefore the 2-qubit thermal cluster at critical temperature is another good closest separable state to the pure cluster state .",
    "it is instructive to look at the thermal cluster state @xmath109 in the `` mixed '' basis and compare it to the pure cluster closest separable state @xmath18 . transforming @xmath109 we have @xmath110 from the form of the matrix",
    "it can be seen that the only way that @xmath111 is when all the terms apart from @xmath112 vanish .",
    "so we arrive at the following four conditions that have to be satisfied simultaneously ; @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the only solution is @xmath115 which corresponds to the pure cluster state case .",
    "therefore as the temperature increases the thermal cluster state does not approach the pure closest separable state @xmath18 .",
    "this last result can be seen also from the fact that the relative entropy between these two states is non - zero , ie .",
    "the relative entropy between two states @xmath117 vanishes if and only if @xmath118 @xcite .    taking a convex mixture of @xmath18 and @xmath107",
    "allows us to find a general form of the closest 2-qubit separable state @xmath119 where @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "this can be verified by computing the gradient of the relative entropy in the usual way , @xmath121\\geq0 $ ] for all @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "now we are in a position to calculate the entanglement of thermal cluster states .",
    "we will use a similar approach as above to show that the form of the closest separable state is the same as in eq.([eq:2_closest_general ] ) .",
    "however this time the parameter @xmath122 that determines the mixture of our two closest separable states from eq.([eq:2_closest_general ] ) will not be completely free and its lower bound will depend on the temperature .",
    "we will show that as the temperature increases towards the critical temperature @xmath123 the parameter @xmath122 increases towards unity .",
    "we already have everything we need to compute the scaling of entanglement with temperature of a thermal 2-qubit cluster state given by eq.([eq:2_thermal_cluster ] ) .",
    "the only thing that remains to determine is a suitable candidate for the closest separable state .",
    "the most obvious choice would be @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "in fact this gives the correct behavior of entanglement @xmath124 $ ] as can be seen in fig.([fig:2_thermal ] ) .",
    "the gradient of the relative entropy in the neighbourhood of the state @xmath107 is non - negative @xmath125 as expected .",
    "we recover the result for pure cluster state . at the critical point @xmath105 the state is separable . ]    now that we know that for 2 qubits the cluster state at critical temperature is a closest separable state we can ask whether there exists a more general form of the state just like in sec.([thermal_ent ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this is in fact possible , albeit with some needed modifications .",
    "we have seen that as the temperature increases the thermal cluster state does not approach the state @xmath32 from sec.([pure ] ) .",
    "this can be also seen from the non - vanishing distance between the separable states @xmath126 and @xmath32 , ie @xmath127 . as the temperature increases the distance between the cluster state @xmath128 and @xmath126 approaches zero as expected .",
    "however this is not true for the distance between @xmath128 and @xmath32 due to the fact that @xmath127 .",
    "this problem can be overcome by not allowing the parameter @xmath122 from eq.([eq:2_closest_general ] ) to take any value from the interval @xmath129 $ ] .",
    "rather we require that the lower bound of the possible values of @xmath122 increases with temperature .",
    "we call this bound @xmath130 and require @xmath131 .    as before we will first demonstrate the general principle at work on a two - qubit cluster state @xmath109 .",
    "first we need to find the new parameter @xmath130 by minimising the distance between the thermal cluster state @xmath109 and the state ( @xmath132 ) @xmath133 for a constant temperature .",
    "solving @xmath134 for @xmath122 gives the new @xmath130",
    "@xmath135 we can straight away confirm that the separable state given by this new parameter @xmath136 is also a closest separable state by calculating the gradient of relative entropy at this state @xmath125 .",

    "relative positions of all the above states in hilbert space are illustrated in fig.([fig : hilbert ] ) .",
    "one thing that the figure does not capture is the fact that the distances @xmath139 and @xmath103 are the same .",

    "@xmath140 designates the set of all entangled states .",
    "as the temperature increases the set of all separable states becomes smaller .",
    "this set is represented by all the points found on the @xmath140-@xmath2 boundary between the states @xmath107 and @xmath133 . ]",
    "this method of finding closest separable states can be extended to general @xmath29-qubit cluster states .",
    "the crucial part is to find the critical temperature at which the cluster becomes fully separable .",
    "due to presence of bound entanglement for @xmath141 this is a non - trivial task and at present it is unclear how it can be achieved .",
    "@xcite calculates upper and lower bounds on the value of the critical temperature for cluster states of different dimensions .",
    "however all that this changes is that the separable state @xmath142 would be shifted to the left of the state @xmath107 on the @xmath140-@xmath2 boundary in fig.([fig : hilbert ] ) since the critical temperature for @xmath141 is higher for than the one calculated here .",
    "we have demonstrated a systematic way of constructing closest separable state to @xmath29-qubit cluster states .",
    "our method reproduces known results for pure states and also allows us to quantify entanglement for mixed cluster states .    for pure states the method relies on writing the density matrix of the state in the `` mixed '' basis and setting any off - diagonal elements to zero .",
    "operationally we can construct this state from @xmath1 copies of 2-qubit closest separable state and joining them together by applying control - phase gates as demonstrated in sec.([pure ] ) .",
    "our method applies to cluster states of all dimensions .",
    "this is particularly useful since cluster states of dimension @xmath143 are universal resource state for quantum computation .",
    "it also turns out that state @xmath32 is not the only closest separable state .",
    "thermal cluster state at critical temperature @xmath126 is also another closest separable state to pure cluster state .",
    "therefore any convex mixture of these two states also minimizes the relative entropy .",
    "however at the moment it is difficult to determine the precise temperature at which the cluster becomes fully separable for cases of more than 2 qubits .",
    "this is due to the presence of bound entanglement .",
    "mixed states require an even more careful approach . when quantifying entanglement in thermal cluster states a convex mixture of @xmath32 and @xmath126 does not minimize the relative entropy anymore .",
    "parameter @xmath122 that determines the mixture of these two states does not take any value from interval @xmath129 $ ] .",
    "instead as the temperature increases the lower bound of this interval increases as well .",
    "so the range of values the parameter @xmath122 can take is constricted to @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "the new lower bound @xmath130 is a function of temperature and as temperature approaches the critical value @xmath145 . in other words",
    "both the thermal cluster @xmath146 and the closest separable state @xmath8 approach the same state .",
