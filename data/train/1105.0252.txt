    "the lep2 experiment gives a lower bound of 114.4 @xcite and if we take the global electro - weak fit into account , the higgs mass should be no more than 200 @xcite .",

    "<S> it is found that in each process , there is an optimal collision energy ( @xmath3 ) for achieving the greatest noncommutative effect , and @xmath3 varies linearly with the nc scale @xmath4 . a brief discussion on the process @xmath5 is also given . </S>"
