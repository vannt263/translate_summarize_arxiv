    "the phase transition from nuclear matter to quark - gluon matter is one of the most concerned topics in modern physics related to heavy - ion collision experiments and compact stars . as a principle tool ,",
    "lattice qcd provides us a framework to investigate non - perturbative phenomena , such as confinement and quark - gluon plasma formation at finite temperature and vanishing  ( small ) chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "however , lattice calculations suffer the sign problem at large chemical potential . to evade this problem several approximation methods",
    "have been proposed  @xcite , but the validity of the result at @xmath0 still should be taken with care  @xcite . on the other hand , to give a complete description of qcd phase diagram some phenomenological effective models  @xcite have been also developed . among these models , the nambu  jona - lasinio  ( njl ) type models  @xcite , especially those coupled with polyakov loop  ( pnjl )  @xcite are predominant , offering a simple illustration of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration , as well as ( de)confinement effect .    the lattice qcd and ( p)njl type models are based on the degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons .",
    "recently , the two - phase model with both hadron and quark degrees of freedom , widely used in the description of the phase transition in neutron star matter under the weak equilibrium  ( e.g.,@xcite ) , has also been taken to study the phase transition related to heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , particularly the phase transition in asymmetric matter .",
    "the latter is possible to be probed in the planned facilities , such as fair at gsi - darmstadt and nica at jinr - dubna  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "only the scalar interacting channel was considered for quark matter , and this channel interaction is responsible for the dynamical masses of quarks .",
    "the isoscalar - vector channel interaction was also included to study the properties of quark matter  @xcite or the hadron - quark phase transition in neutron star matter  @xcite .",
    "however , up to date , the vector interacting channels ( including both the isoscalar vector and isovector vector interaction ) have not been considered in describing quark matter , in the context of heavy - ion collisions , in the two - phase model .",
    "the inclusion of these vector interactions will modify the quark pressure and chemical potentials .",
    "in particular , the isovector - vector interacting channel contributes to @xmath1 quark flavors differently .",
    "correspondingly , the onset densities of the quark phase are possibly modified and some observation signals of hadron - quark phase transition in asymmetric matter may be influenced .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the effect of the vector channel interactions on the hadron - quark phase transition , and related information deduced from new data in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe briefly the modified effective quark model and give the relevant formulas with the newly included isovector and isoscalar vector interactions . in section iii",
    ", we present the numerical results and discuss the influence of vector channel interactions on the hadron - quark phase transition of dense asymmetric matter . for the isovector",
    "part we include also some results with an isospin - mit - bag model , just to stress the physics behind the symmetry terms in the quark sector , not dependent on the models .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section iv .",
    "in the two - phase model hadron matter is described by the nonlinear walecka model , and quark matter is described by the pnjl model with the newly added vector interactions . in the mixed phase ,",
    "the pure hadronic phase and quark phase are connected to each other through the gibbs conditions with the thermal , chemical and mechanical equilibria , based on baryon number and isospin conservation in the strong interacting process .    the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach will be taken to describe the properties of hadronic matter .",
    "this model can provide an excellent description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "the exchanged mesons in this model include the isoscalar - scalar meson  ( @xmath2 ) , isoscalar - vector meson  ( @xmath3 ) , isovector - vector meson  ( @xmath4 ) and isovector - scalar meson  ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is called the non linear-@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) effective interaction . for details ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    for the quark phase",
    ", we adopt an extension of the two - flavor njl model to include the polyakov loop contribution@xcite .",

    "we also try to include in the njl term the isoscalar  vector and isovector  vector interaction channels as given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "some considerations are in order . in our previous work ,",
    "@xcite , where only the scalar interaction channels were considered , calculations were performed within a relativistic mean field approximation which essentially corresponds to the hartree approximation .",
    "however , the inclusion of the fock ( exchange ) terms would be desirable .",
    "in fact , these terms originate from the correlations due to the fermi ",
    "dirac statistics , therefore they are related to a genuine quantum effect , which in general can not be neglected when studying a many  body system . including the fock terms , the whole variety of processes in quark dynamics arising from the fermionic intrinsic degrees of freedom (  spin , flavor and color  ) , are automatically accounted for . indeed , even starting from an effective lagrangian containing only scalar channels , the exchange terms naturally yield contributions in the vector channels , as we will show in the following .",
    "a quantity of interest in the study of quark dynamics is the statistical average of the canonical energy - momentum density tensor , @xmath18 , from which thermodynamical quantities , such as the pressure , can be derived . for the considered lagrangian ,",
    "the interaction part of this quantity , @xmath19 , depends on the statistical average of the product of four quark fields , that in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , can be written as : @xmath20 where the brackets denote statistical averaging and the colons denote normal ordering .",
    "it is useful to define the matrix @xmath21_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] : @xmath22_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\ , < : \\bar{q}_\\beta(x)q_\\alpha(x):>\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are triple indices for spin , isospin ( flavor ) and color .",
    "as far as one is concerned with the equilibrium properties of isotropic and non  colored quark matter it is sufficient to consider only the scalar and vector channels (  isoscalar and isovector  ) .",
    "then the matrix @xmath25 can be decomposed as : @xmath26 it should be noticed that this matrix is related to the various densities characterizing the system .",
    "indeed the scalar and current isoscalar densities are given by : @xmath27 @xmath28 while the isovector counterparts are given by : @xmath29 @xmath30 where the traces are taken over spin , flavor and color indices .",
    "then the interaction part of the energy ",

    "momentum tensor can be evaluated exploiting the decomposition given in eq .",
    "( [ clif ] ) .",
    "after some algebra one realizes that the effect of the fock terms is equivalent to redefine the coupling constants , as written below : @xmath32 then , with the effective coupling constants given above , calculations can be performed as in the hartree approximation .",
    "it should be remarked that all the relevant interaction channels in general can occur in the hf approximation , even if some channel is absent in the original lagrangian .",
    "for instance , if the vector channels are not present , i.e. , we take @xmath33 and @xmath34 as in our previous work , contributions to the @xmath3 channel are naturally arising from the exchange terms associated with the scalar channels . on the other hand",
    ", the vector isovector @xmath4 channel gets contributions ( both direct and exchange ) only from vector channels .    since the critical end ",

    "this is due to the fact that in the symmetric case the curve @xmath105 does not depend on the quark fraction @xmath86 , see also refs .  @xcite .",
    "both figures 1 and 2 show that the isovector  vector channel of the quark interaction plays a more important role on the phase transition with increasing density and lowering temperature .",

    "these features of the local asymmetry may lead to some observable effects in the hadronization during the expansion phase of heavy ion collisions , such as an inversion in the trend of emission of neutron rich clusters , an enhancement of @xmath107 , @xmath108 yield ratios in high - density regions , as well as an enhancement of the production of isospin - rich resonances and subsequent decays , for more details see refs .",

    "indeed , with @xmath124 , the onset transition density , even in asymmetric matter , is already shifted to density values larger than @xmath125 .",
    "thus the study of this transition and of the associated phase diagram may give information on the properties of the interaction between quarks and corresponding coupling constants .",
    "from the definition of the effective coupling constants , eqs.(5 ) , one can see that a considerable positive contribution to @xmath126 , equal to @xmath127 , already comes from the exchange terms of the scalar channels . on the other hand ,",
    "the observation of such a transition in relativistic heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies , where moderate density and temperature values are reached , would point to smaller value of @xmath128 .",

    "<S> the hadron - quark / gluon phase transition is studied in the two - phase model . as a further study of our previous work , both the isoscalar and isovector vector interactions </S>",
    "<S> are included in the polyakov loop modified nambu  jona - lasinio model  ( pnjl ) for the quark phase . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of the exchange ( fock ) terms is stressed and suitably accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation shows that the isovector vector interaction delays the phase transition to higher densities and the range of the mixed phase correspondingly shrinks . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile the asymmetry parameter of quark matter in the mixed phase decreases with the strengthening of this interaction channel . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to some possible observation signals being weakened , although still present . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these can be rather general effects of a repulsion in the quark phase due to the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is also confirmed by a simpler calculation with the mit  bag model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the asymmetry parameter of quark matter is slightly enhanced with the inclusion of the isoscalar vector interaction , but the phase transition will be moved to higher densities . </S>",
    "<S> the largest uncertainty on the phase transition lies in the undetermined coupling constants of the vector interactions . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> new data on the mixed phase obtained from heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies appear very important . </S>"
