    "strange particle production provides an important tool to understand the reaction dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the measured yields at top sps energy can be interpreted as the result of the decay of a coherent prehadronic state , filling the available hadronic phase space .",
    "several indications suggest that this state is indeed a deconfined phase of matter @xcite .",
    "in order to search for onset phenomena signalling a phase transition at lower collision energies , the na49 collaboration proposed an energy scan programme for central pb+pb collisions , spanning the beam energies between top ags ( @xmath8 ) and top sps ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this programme was completed in 2002 with data taking at @xmath10 and @xmath0 . in this contribution , we will focus on preliminary results on kaons at @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "na49 results on the energy dependence of @xmath11 production were shown recently @xcite ; preliminary data of @xmath12 and @xmath13 were presented in this conference @xcite .",

    "the na49 detector @xcite , operating in fixed - target mode at the cern - sps , consists mainly of four large tracking chambers backed up with tof scintillator walls . momentum determination is provided by tracking in the field of two superconducting magnets ; the collision centrality is determined from the measurement of the energy deposited in a zero - degree calorimeter .",
    "particle identification is achieved by the measurements of the specific energy loss @xmath20 ( resolution @xmath21 ) in the tpcs and the time - of - flight ( resolution @xmath22 ) with the scintillator walls .",
    "the magnetic field was scaled proportional to the beam energy to achieve similar geometrical acceptances .",
    "table [ tab : datasets ] summarises the data sets taken within the energy scan programme .",
    "the data at @xmath23 are not yet analysed .",
    "in addition to the published results for @xmath2 , @xmath24 and @xmath9 @xcite , we have recently analysed kaon and pion production at @xmath0 . depending on their momentum ,",
    "charged kaons were identified by tof , combined tof and @xmath20 or @xmath20 alone , as figure [ fig : kaonid ] illustrates .",
    "geant calculations were used to correct the raw yields for geometrical acceptance , in - flight decay and the efficiency of the time - of - flight system . the losses due to track reconstruction inefficiencies were studied by embedding simulated tracks into real raw data events and reconstructing them with the standard software .",
    "@xmath25 yields were obtained from the distributions of all negatively charged hadrons by subtraction of the contributions from @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and secondary hadrons from weak decays and interactions in the detector .",
    "the @xmath29 were not measured directly but calculated from the @xmath25 yield assuming that the @xmath30 ratio , which was measured in regions where both tof and @xmath20 information were available , is constant over phase space .",
    "details of the kaon and pion analyses are given in @xcite .",
    "the newly obtained midrapidity @xmath31 spectra of @xmath32 and @xmath26 at @xmath0 , measured in the tof system , are compared in figure [ fig : kaon_mtspec ] to those at higher beam energies . at all energies , the spectra exhibit an exponential shape to very good accuracy . moreover ,",
    "a thermal fit of the form @xmath33 yields almost identical slope parameters for all beam energies as demonstrated in figure [ fig : kaonslopes ] .",
    "the excitation function of @xmath34 shows a steep rise for ags energies , stays constant over the complete sps energy range and rises again towards the values measured at rhic .",
    "this surprising result points towards a softening of the equation of state at sps energies as discussed in @xcite .    extrapolating the measured yields to full @xmath35 by the exponential fit function , we obtained the midrapidity yield ratios as plotted in figure [ fig : kpi_midrap ] .",
    "the @xmath4 ratio at @xmath0 confirms the previously observed trend of a decrease in this ratio with beam energy at sps @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 ratio seems to also show a small irregularity at @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , no anomalous behaviour is seen in the @xmath36 ratio .",
    "the rapidity spectra of charged kaons and @xmath25 as measured by na49 are shown in figure [ fig : kaon_rapidity ] .",
    "they were parametrised by the sum of two gaussians displaced symmetrically with respect to midrapidity as indicated by the full lines .",
    "we observe an increase of the width of the rapidity distributions with beam energy for all three particle types .",
    "total yields were obtained by integrating the fits to the measured rapidity distributions . comparing figure [ fig : kpi_total ] to figure [ fig : kpi_midrap ]",
    ", it can be seen that the energy dependencies of the @xmath37 ratios in full phase space are similar to those at midrapidity .",
    "a sharp maximum is observed at @xmath0 in @xmath4 , which is not reproduced by either the extended hadron gas model @xcite or transport codes @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this behaviour is not seen in p+p collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "a spiky feature in the excitation function of the total strangeness to pion ratio @xmath38 was predicted by the statistical model of the early stage @xcite , assuming a phase transition from confined matter to a quark - gluon - plasma at low sps energies . as figure",
    "[ fig : kpi_total ] demonstrates , the preliminary data at @xmath0 together with the measurements at higher sps energies are in good agreement with the predictions of this model .",
    "note that the error bars for the na49 results are dominated by systematic uncertainties which are to a large extent common for all measured beam energies .",
    "in the context of strange particle production , the @xmath1 meson is of particular interest .",
    "its overall strangeness neutrality makes it insensitive to the strange chemical potential in hadro - statistical models . on the other hand , consisting of a strange and an anti - strange quark it should be more sensitive than kaons to strangeness enhancement if the number of available strange quarks is determined in a prehadronic stage of the collision .",
    "previously , an enhancement in @xmath1 production per pion at top sps energy of about a factor of 3 , comparing central pb+pb to p+p collisions at the same beam energy , has been reported @xcite .",
    "we have now extended the analysis to central pb+pb at @xmath3 and @xmath39 .    in na49 ,",
    "the @xmath1 meson is measured by its decay into charged kaons .",
    "details of the analysis method can be found in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : phi_minv ] shows the invariant - mass signals at the two energies in the forward rapidity hemisphere .",
    "the depletion on the left side of the signal can be shown to stem from the final state strong interaction of @xmath32 and @xmath26 .",
    "the widths of the @xmath1 peaks are consistent with the free - particle width @xcite folded with the experimental resolution of about @xmath40 . for the peak positions , we find at all three energies analysed so far a slight ( @xmath41 ) deviation from the literature value @xcite , as depicted in the right panel of figure [ fig : phi_minv ] .",
    "a similar deviation has been observed at the ags @xcite , albeit with a larger error .",
    "in contrast , our analysis of p+p collisions at @xmath9 @xcite gives exactly the book value .",
    "it is still under investigation whether this shift is an experimental effect , possibly linked to the distortion in the background - subtracted invariant - mass spectra .",
    "the transverse spectra of the @xmath1 can be seen in figure [ fig : phi_transverse ] .",
    "again , they are reasonably well described by exponential distributions , but in contrast to kaons , the slope parameter increases with beam energy ( right panel of figure [ fig : phi_transverse ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that na50 reports a different @xmath34 at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : phi_rapidity ] shows the measured rapidity distributions of the @xmath1 meson at @xmath2 and @xmath3 in comparison to the published spectrum at top sps energy . in all cases , a gaussian distribution gives a good description of the data , with a width increasing with beam energy .",
    "this trend is in line with observations for pion and kaon production . summing the measured bins and extrapolating to full phase space using the gaussian fit",
    ", we obtained the total @xmath1 yield , which is shown in figure [ fig : phi_yield ] normalised to the average of the @xmath29 and @xmath25 yields and to the @xmath26 yield .",
    "we observe a monotonic increase in @xmath5 from ags via sps to rhic energies , quite similar to the excitation function of @xmath42 .",
    "this similarity can be straightforwardly seen in the @xmath43 ratio , which is , within errors , independent of @xmath44 .    in the light of the discrepancies between the @xmath1 measurements in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels @xcite , both in slope parameter and total yield , na49 has undertaken an effort to reconstruct the @xmath1 signal in the @xmath47 decay channel , which should be similar to the decay into @xmath46 .",
    "for this analysis , the high - statistics data set at @xmath9 has been used .",
    "as figure [ fig : phi_ee ] demonstrates , we do not observe a signal in this channel .",
    "using the expected invariant - mass resolution obtained from a detailed detector simulation , we estimate the upper limit resulting from this analysis to be @xmath48 , with currently large systematic errors .",
    "most probably , this measurement will unfortunately have no discriminating power to clear up the reported experimental differences .",
    "with a still growing wealth of data on strange particle production , the question arises whether these data give rise to a consistent picture of the reaction dynamics in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "particle yields provide information about the chemical freeze - out stage of the collision , while the transverse spectra give insight into the kinetic freeze - out , i.  e.  the stage when elastic interactions cease .",
    "= 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm    it has been shown before that the measured particle yields or yield ratios resulting from pb+pb collisions at top sps energies can be reproduced by statistical models based on a grand canonical ensemble with hadronic degrees of freedom . we thus employ a representative of this kind of models @xcite to fit the na49 data measured so far at @xmath2 , @xmath24 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that the model used employs a strangeness suppression factor @xmath49 , which accounts for an incomplete saturation of strangeness with respect to a fully equilibrated hadron gas .",
    "this additional parameter enables the model to reproduce the yields also at the lower beam energies with reasonable accuracy as figure [ fig : becattini ] demonstrates .",
    "the fit parameters , namely the temperature @xmath34 , the baryochemical potential @xmath50 and @xmath49 reflect the conditions at chemical freeze - out .",
    "figure [ fig : freezeout ] shows the results in the @xmath34-@xmath50 plane together with results obtained for sis , ags and rhic energies .",
    "it appears that chemical freeze - out occurs on a smooth curve in this plane which has been interpreted as being determined by a constant energy per particle @xcite .",
    "moreover , at sps the freeze - out curve approaches the expected phase boundary between hadronic matter and the quark - gluon - plasma as calculated with lattice qcd @xcite .    figure [ fig : blastwave ] depicts a compilation of hadron transverse mass spectra , measured by na49 at @xmath39 and @xmath9 .",
    "the lines represent a radial - flow fit @xcite , assuming a constant transverse expansion velocity and common kinetic freeze - out for all particle types .",
    "pions have been excluded from the fit because of the significant contribution of resonance decays to their low-@xmath35 yields .",
    "obviously , the model can well describe all data at both energies , which is also true for @xmath3 .",
    "the values of the fit parameters , temperature @xmath34 and expansion velocity @xmath51 , are similar for all three energies .",
    "although the model used may employ oversimplified assumptions , it shows that the available data can be understood in the framework of a locally equilibrated , rapidly expanding fireball .",
    "we observe no deviations of the heavy hyperons ( @xmath52 ) from this picture , which would signal an earlier freeze - out for these particles .",
    "we have presented new experimental results obtained within the energy scan programme of na49 , in particular kaon production at @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at @xmath39 and @xmath3 .",
    "the excitation function of the @xmath4 ratio shows a sharp maximum around @xmath0 , which has been predicted by the statistical model of the early stage , thus supporting the scenario of a phase transition at low sps energies .",
    "the observation that the kaon slope parameters do not depend on beam energy in the sps regime supplies further evidence for this picture .",
    "the slope of the @xmath1 meson , in contrast , rises with beam energy .",
    "the @xmath43 ratio is found to be independent of collision energy ; the @xmath5 ratio thus increases smoothly from ags via sps to rhic .",
    "the measured particle yields can be well reproduced by a hadron gas model employing a strangeness undersaturation factor @xmath53 .",
    "chemical freeze - out seems to occur on a smooth curve in the @xmath7 plane , close to the expected phase boundary to the qgp .",
    "the transverse spectra can be interpreted at the three energies analysed so far by a rapidly expanding thermal source , showing no evidence of an earlier decoupling of the heavy hyperons .",
