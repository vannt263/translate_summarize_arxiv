    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ graanishf ] , showing a well defined trend for @xmath147 as a function of the unit cell volume @xmath83 .",
    "these results suggest that decreasing the @xmath83 value is the physical origin for triggering anisotropic magnetic properties for @xmath0copo .",
    "since previously reported data@xcite evidence that smaller @xmath0 ions induce a reduction in @xmath150 and @xmath151 axes such that the @xmath152 ratio is approximately constant ( i.  e. , the lattice is contracting isotropically ) , one reasonable conclusion is that the pnictogen height @xmath153 is reducing faster , making the local tetrahedral environment progressively more distorted .",
    "however , we also expect a sizeable interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic degrees of freedom from rare - earth and pnictogen ions , respectively , which is typically measured by means of local - probe techniques for @xmath3o oxides.@xcite while this effect may be well enhanced by the increasing chemical pressure , we argue that it may introduce an indirect transfer of anisotropic properties from the @xmath1 orbitals of @xmath0 ions to the @xmath2 bands arising from co orbitals and ultimately influencing the magnetocrystalline anisotropy . in this respect , extending our measurements to a more complete set of @xmath0copo samples with different prolaticity properties for the @xmath0 orbitals would lead to a important check on which of the two proposed mechanisms is indeed the dominant one .",
    "another scenario can be considered in order to understand the origin of the observed behaviour .",
    "one robust output of our investigation is that lacopo shows almost fully - isotropic magnetic properties within the fm phase , a fact which is surprising in the light of the typically anisotropic properties of uniaxial magnets.@xcite these features may be only apparently isotropic if one assumes that a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy could be effectively compensated by shape anisotropy effects , under the hypothesis that the spherical grains composing the investigated samples are coupled among them .",
    "while it seems quite unlikely that this compensation effect leads to completely symmetric lineshapes as the experimental ones measured for lacopo , the main conclusions outlined above ( i.  e. , the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is enhanced by @xmath0 substitution ) are robustly preserved also within this scenario .",
    "we reported on ferromagnetic resonance measurements in @xmath0copo for different @xmath0 ions .",
    "we unambiguously detected the gradual development of a sizeable easy - plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy upon substituting the @xmath0 ion .",
    "the observed behaviour is discussed to a complex interplay of structural effects and of the sizeable interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic degrees of freedom from rare - earth and pnictogen ions .",
