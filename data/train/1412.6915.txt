    "cosmological observations @xcite of the past one and a half decades indicate that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion . although a non - zero cosmological constant can explain the current acceleration of the universe , one still has to explain why it is so small and why only at recent times it has started to dominate the energy density of the universe @xcite .",
    "these issues have motivated the exploration of alternative theories to explain the late time acceleration as due to a source of energy referred to as dark energy @xcite .",
    "a quintessence model is one amongst such theories where the dark energy arises from a scalar field @xmath5 rolling slowly down a potential .",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath6 can be defined as the ratio of the pressure to the energy density [ w ] w = p/. a cosmological constant is equivalent to @xmath7 whereas a quintessence field generates a time dependent equation of state @xmath8 .",
    "caldwell and linder @xcite showed that the quintessence models in which the scalar field rolls down its potential towards a minimum can be classified into two categories , namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 models , with quite different behavior . in thawing models at early times",
    "the field gets locked at a value away from the minimum of the potential due to large hubble damping . at late times",
    "when hubble damping diminishes , the field starts to roll down towards the minimum .",
    "these models have a value of @xmath6 which begins near @xmath11 and gradually increases with time . in freezing models the field rolls towards its potential minimum initially and slows down at late times as it comes to dominate the universe .",
    "these models have a value of @xmath6 which decreases with time . in both cases",
    "@xmath6 @xmath12 around the present epoch . thawing models with a nearly flat potential provide a natural way to produce a value of @xmath6 that stays close to , but not exactly equal to @xmath11 .",
    "the field begins with @xmath13 at high redshifts , and @xmath6 increases only slightly by low redshifts .",
    "these models depend on initial field values ( in contrast with freezing models of quintessence which depend on the shape of the potential ) . in the present work",
    "we evaluate the cosmological consequences of the evolving quintessence field in the context of thawing models by considering various observational datasets and obtain plausible initial values of the scalar field @xmath14 .",
    "a lower bound on the the allowed values of @xmath2 has been previously obtained in ref .",
    "our current numerical analysis provides stronger constraints on @xmath2 .",
    "we further relate the initial value to quantum fluctuations of @xmath5 during inflation and thereby to the duration of inflation .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath2 then provides a lower bound on the number of e - foldings of inflation in our scenario where the initial value of the quintessence field is determined by quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation .",
    "our work in this article is organised as follows . in section [ thawing ]",
    "we describe the thawing quintessence model in the standard minimal framework . in section [ constraints ]",
    "we provide a detailed description of the datasets used to obtain the observational constraints on the parameters of the model . in section [ analysis ]",
