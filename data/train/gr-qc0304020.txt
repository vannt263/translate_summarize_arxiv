    "<S> one of the greatest challenges facing gravitational wave astronomy in the low frequency band is the confusion noise generated by the vast numbers of unresolved galactic and extra galactic binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the binary confusion noise suffer from several sources of astrophysical uncertainty , such as the form of the initial mass function and the star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> there is also considerable uncertainty about what defines the confusion limit . </S>",
    "<S> various ad - hoc rules have been proposed , such as the one source per bin rule , and the one source per three bin rule . here </S>",
    "<S> information theoretic methods are used to derive a more realistic estimate for the confusion limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the gravitational wave background becomes unresolvable when there is , on average , more than one source per eight frequency bins . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the best estimate for the frequency at which galactic binaries become a source of noise from 1.45 mhz to 2.54 mhz .    </S>",
    "<S> population synthesis models and astronomical observations suggest that there may be as many as @xmath0 galactic disk binaries containing two compact objects . </S>",
    "<S> several million of these binaries are expected to emit gravitational waves that can be detected by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) . at frequencies below @xmath1 mhz </S>",
    "<S> these systems constitute an embarrassment of riches for gravitational wave astronomy as the number of sources is so great that it becomes impossible to isolated individual binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the unresolved galactic gravitational wave background is a source of noise that degrades lisa s ability to detect other sources , such as extra - galactic supermassive black hole binaries .    </S>",
    "<S> a much quoted definition of the gravitational wave confusion noise level is the amplitude at which there is , on average , at least one source per frequency bin . </S>",
    "<S> even this crude definition takes into account some data analysis considerations as the width of a frequency bin , @xmath2 , depends on the observation time @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the longer the observation , the smaller the confusion noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , hellings @xcite pointed out that there was not enough information in one frequency bin to fully specify a binary system . </S>",
    "<S> a monochromatic , circular binary is described by the seven parameters @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gravitational wave frequency , @xmath6 is the intrinsic amplitude , @xmath7 describe the sky location , @xmath8 denotes the inclination , @xmath9 is the polarization angle and @xmath10 is the orbital phase . </S>",
    "<S> hellings reasoned that each frequency bin only contains two pieces of information - the real and imaginary parts of the strain spectral density - while six pieces of information are needed to fix @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at least three frequency bins are required to solve for the six parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency was not included in the information budget on the grounds that it came for free from the fourier transform . while the three bin rule is an improvement over the naive one bin rule , it lacks a rigorous justification . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , phinney @xcite has revisited the confusion noise question by using shannon information theory to estimate the total number of binaries than can be resolved by lisa . here </S>",
    "<S> a similar approach is used to estimate the number of frequency bins that are needed to resolve a binary system .    </S>",
    "<S> the estimate is made by comparing the information contained in one frequency bin with the amount of information required to record the parameters that describe a binary system . </S>",
    "<S> both of these quantities depend on the signal to noise ratio of the instrument . a higher signal to </S>",
    "<S> noise ratio means more information in each bin , but it also means that the binary parameters are better determined , and thus take more information to describe .    </S>",
    "<S> the baud rate of the detector , @xmath12 , depends on the bandwidth of the signal , @xmath13 , and the signal to noise ratio @xmath14 according to @xmath15 the total number of bits transmitted during an observation time @xmath3 is simply @xmath16 . setting the bandwidth equal to @xmath17 , it follows that the amount of information per bin is equal to @xmath18 . because the lisa observatory is designed to operate in stereo , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ lisa can detect both gravitational wave polarizations @xcite , the total amount of information available in each frequency bin is larger than @xmath19 , but not a full factor of two larger as the information in each channel is not fully independent . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the stereo performance is further complicated by the correlated noise in the two channels . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , the information budget is calculated for a single channel , with the expectation that the result would be little changed by including the second channel .    the amount of information required to record the parameters of a binary system can be estimated by comparing the volume of the error ellipsoid to the volume of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> to see how this works , consider the following one dimensional example . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the angle @xmath20 can be measured to an accuracy of three degrees . </S>",
    "<S> recording @xmath20 to this accuracy takes @xmath21 bits of data . </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the seven dimensional error ellipsoid that characterizes the binary subtraction problem for lisa can be estimated by calculating the determinant of the fisher information matrix @xmath22 . to calculate the fisher matrix an expression </S>",
    "<S> is needed that describes how information about the binary is encoded in the the detector output . at low frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> the signal in each lisa channel takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 expressions for the detector response functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the doppler modulation @xmath27 , and the gravitational wave amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the components of the fisher matrix are found using the expression @xcite @xmath30 where the components @xmath31 range over the seven parameters @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the one - sided noise spectral density . in general , the fisher matrix is a complicated function of all seven parameters , which implies that the volume of the error ellipsoid varies depending on where the binary sits in parameter space . assuming that the noise is gaussian , and working in the limit where the signal is large compared to the noise , the volume of the seven dimensional error ellipsoid is give by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the noise covariance matrix , @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of information needed to describe or subtract a binary source emitting gravitational waves with frequency @xmath5 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the volume of the parameter space in a bandwidth @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth needed to subtract a typical binary can be estimated by solving the transcendental equation @xmath39 for @xmath13 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is the average amount of information required to remove one binary , and @xmath41 is the average signal to noise ratio across the bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> note that the left hand side of the transcendental equation depends logarithmically on the bandwidth and the observation time , while the right hand side depends linearly on these quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> calculating @xmath42 is a straightforward , yet computationally intensive task . </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the error ellipsoid can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath43 of the covariance matrix @xmath44 : @xmath45 the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix lie along the principle axes of the error ellipsoid , which may not be aligned with the coordinate axes . </S>",
    "<S> the fisher matrix can be expressed in the form @xmath46 where the signal strength is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 dt \\bigr ) / \\bigl ( \\int_0^t \\left ( c_+^2+c_\\times^2\\right ) dt \\bigr).\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude modulation functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend on @xmath53 but are independent of @xmath5 and @xmath10 , while the phase function @xmath54 depends on @xmath55 but is independent of @xmath56 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the amplitude modulation terms are solely responsible for determining the intrinsic amplitude , inclination and polarization , while the phase term is solely responsible for determining the frequency and orbital phase . </S>",
    "<S> both the amplitude and phase play a role in fixing the sky location @xmath7 .    using the expressions derived in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is a simple , yet laborious task to compute @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the final expressions are long and rather opaque . </S>",
    "<S> most striking is the strong dependence on @xmath58 , which makes it exceedingly difficult to give simple answers to questions such as `` what is the angular resolution of the lisa detector ? '' . </S>",
    "<S> one trend that is obvious is the improvement in the information encoding at high frequencies that comes from the doppler modulation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to obtain a lower limit on the bandpass required to remove a source from the data stream one should work in the very low frequency limit ( which is equivalent to setting @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> even then @xmath60 shows a strong dependence on @xmath61 that defies efforts to define `` typical '' parameter sensitivities . using ( [ vol ] ) and ( [ fish ] ) we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 when calculating @xmath60 the dimensionless quantity @xmath64 is used instead of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , @xmath65 is the number of wave cycles in the observation period . in terms of the coordinates @xmath66 , the volume @xmath38 is equal to @xmath67 where the final expression uses the fact that @xmath6 is typically within a factor of @xmath68 of the fixed signal strength @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the number of frequency bins covered by the bandwidth @xmath13 . combing equations ( [ sinfo ] ) , ( [ volx ] ) and ( [ vb ] ) yields </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 while the quantity @xmath42 does vary with the binary s location in parameter space @xmath72 , the variations are tamed by the logarithmic dependence on @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ] shows a histogram of the quantity @xmath74 in the very low frequency limit ( @xmath75 mhz ) for @xmath76 of observations . </S>",
    "<S> the histogram was generated by sampling @xmath7 on a uniform healpix grid  @xcite with 49152 pixels , and by sampling both @xmath8 and @xmath9 uniformly at 200 points , making for a grand total of @xmath77 samples . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath78 was found to have a median value of @xmath79 and a mean value of @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the average value of @xmath42 is equal to @xmath81 solving the transcendental equation ( [ tran ] ) yields @xmath82 thus , for typical sources , @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in striking disagreement with the recent work of krlack and tinto  @xcite , where a fisher matrix based approach was used to derive the result @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> they argue that the number of sources than can be removed scales as @xmath85 , which is precisely opposite to the reasoning used to derive eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sinfo ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been estimated  @xcite that the number of detached wd - wd binaries per @xmath86 frequency bin scales as @xmath87 setting @xmath88 yields @xmath89 mhz for the frequency cutoff below which the galactic population of wd - wd binaries becomes a confusion noise source for lisa . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the limit from @xmath90 mhz to @xmath91 mhz may not sound like much , but it translates into a significant reduction in the number of galactic binaries lisa can resolve .    </S>",
    "<S> the `` eight bin rule '' derived above is likely a fairly robust estimate . </S>",
    "<S> mostly it comes from the overall @xmath92 factor that scales the size of the seven dimensional error ellipsoid . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate is fairly insensitive to how @xmath60 is calculated , so including the doppler modulation will only slightly increase @xmath93 . as argued earlier , </S>",
    "<S> utilizing the full stereo capabilities of lisa would reduce @xmath93 , but by less than a factor of two . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a single channel was used to test an algorithm for identifying and subtracting binary systems from the lisa data stream . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the subtraction worked for 3 sources separated by an average of 5 bins . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to contradict the eight bin rule , but information from surrounding bins was also used . the number of bins with @xmath94 that contributed to the subtraction totaled @xmath95 , so approximately 13 bins were used to remove each signal , and even then the subtraction was imperfect . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key questions to be addressed in future work is how close can one get to the information theory limit . </S>",
    "<S> at least now we have a better idea of what that limit is . </S>"
