    "nucleon - antinucleon ( @xmath6 ) annihilation , due to the richness of possible final meson states , is considered one of the major testing grounds in the study of hadronic interactions . both quark @xcite and baryon exchange models",
    "@xcite have been applied to @xmath6 annihilation data . however , the task of extracting information on the dynamics of the @xmath6 process is enormously complicated by the influence of initial and final state interactions .",
    "some of the simplest annihilation channels , where the theoretical complexity of the @xmath6 annihilation process is partially reduced , are radiative two - body decay modes , where final state interaction is negligible .",
    "experimental branching ratios for radiative decay channels in annihilation from @xmath0 atoms were made available by recent measurements of the crystal barrel collaboration at cern , performing a systematic study of the reactions @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "radiative decays of the @xmath10 atom where , in contrast to ordinary production of nonstrange mesonic final states , isospin is not conserved , are well suited for studying interference effects in the isospin transition amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most natural framework in studying radiative decay modes is the vector dominance model ( vdm ) @xcite . in setting up the annihilation mechanism",
    "one adopts a two - step process where the @xmath0 system first annihilates into two mesons , with at least one of the mesons being a vector meson ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , and where the produced vector meson converts into a real photon via the vdm @xcite . in this case",
    ", production rates of radiative decay modes can be related to branching ratios of final states containing one or two vector mesons . a first analysis @xcite in the framework of vdm was performed by crystal barrel , showing that the interference in the isospin amplitudes is sizable and almost maximally destructive for all channels considered .",
    "the phase structure of the interference term is determined by two contributions : i ) the relative signs of the generic strong transition amplitudes for @xmath13 or @xmath14 acting in different isospin channels ; ii ) the presence of the initial state interaction in the @xmath0 atom , which mixes the @xmath0 and @xmath3 configurations .",
    "similarly , analogous sources are responsible for the isospin interference effects in the strong annihilation reactions @xmath15 @xcite . here , however , definite conclusions concerning the size and sign of the interference terms depend strongly on the model used for the annihilation dynamics .    in the present work",
    "we show how the determination of the interference terms in the analysis of the radiative decays can be uniquely connected to the isospin mixing effects in the @xmath0 atomic wave functions .",
    "the extraction of the magnitude and sign of the interference from the experimental data can in turn be used to investigate the isospin dependence , at least in an averaged fashion , of the s - wave @xmath6 interaction .",
    "we study this point for different @xmath6 interaction models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ form ] we develop the formalism for radiative decays of protonium . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we adopt a two - step formalism , that is @xmath0 annihilation into two - meson channels containing a vector meson and its subsequent conversion into a photon via the vdm .",
    "both steps are derived consistently from the underlying quark model in order to fix the phase structure of the isospin dependent transition amplitudes .",
    "we also indicate the derivation of the branching ratios for radiative decays of s - wave protonium , where the initial state interaction of the atomic @xmath0 system is included . sec .",
    "[ results ] is devoted to the presentation of the results .",
    "we first perform a simple analysis to show that theoretically predicted branching ratios for radiative decays are consistent with the experimental data .",
    "we then show that the isospin interference terms present in the expression for the branching ratios can be uniquely connected to the @xmath0 - @xmath3 mixing in the atomic wave function , induced by initial state interaction .",
    "we quantify the details of this effect for different models of the @xmath6 interaction and apply the formalism developed in sec .",
    "[ form ] to extract size and sign of the interference from data , which will be shown to be sensitively dependent on the kinematical form factors associated with the transition . furthermore , we comment on the application of vdm on the transition @xmath5 , where the corresponding large branching ratio plays a central role in the discussion on the apparent violations of the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in describing the radiative decays of protonium we apply the vector dominance model @xcite .",
    "we consider the two - step process of fig .",
    "1 , where the primary @xmath0 annihilation in a strong transition into a two - meson final state , containing the vector mesons @xmath11 and @xmath12 , is followed by the conversion of the vector meson into a real photon . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to orbital angular momentum l=0 for the initial @xmath0 state , corresponding to the dominant contribution in the liquid hydrogen data of crystal barrel @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider the transition processes @xmath7 , where @xmath16 and @xmath9 , with @xmath17 presently excluded .",
    "the final state @xmath18 plays a special role in the discussion of the apparent violation of the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule , where a strong enhancement relative to @xmath19 was observed @xcite . within the current approach",
    "the description of the first - step process @xmath20 and its phase structure can not be accomodated due to the special nature of the @xmath21 , a dominant @xmath22 configuration . later on we will comment on the possibility to explain the enhanced @xmath18 rate within the vdm , as suggested in the literature @xcite , and on the implications of the analysis presented here .    in the two - step process",
    "we have to introduce a consistent description for either transition in order to identify the source of the interference term .",
    "in particular , the relative phase structure of the strong transition matrix elements @xmath23 versus @xmath24 ( @xmath25 and @xmath9 ) is a relevant input in determining the sign of the interference .",
    "basic su(3 ) flavor symmetry arguments @xcite do not allow to uniquely fix the phase structure , hence further considerations concerning spin and orbital angular momentum dynamics in the @xmath6 annihilation process have to be introduced .",
    "microscopic approaches to @xmath6 annihilation either resort to quark models ( for an overview see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or are based on baryon exchange models @xcite . here",
    "we choose the quark model approach , which allows to describe both , the strong transition of @xmath0 into two mesons and the vector meson conversion into a photon .    for the process @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "we apply the so - called a2 model @xcite , depicted in fig .",
    "2a . in the discussion of annihilation models based on quark degrees of freedom",
    "this mechanism was shown to give the best phenomenological description in various meson branching ratios @xcite . in a recent work",
    "@xcite we showed that the a2 model combined with a corresponding annihilation mechanism into three mesons can describe @xmath0 cross sections in a quality expected from simple non - relativistic quark models .",

    "the flavor dependence of the transition is contained in the factor @xmath49 , where q is the quark charge matrix and @xmath50 the @xmath51 flavor wave function of vector meson v. in setting up the two - step process @xmath52 we use time - ordered perturbation theory with the resulting matrix element @xcite @xmath53 where the relativistic propagator for the intermediate vector meson in a zero width approximation is included .",
    "we resort to a relativistic prescription of the vector meson , since , with the kinematical constraint @xmath54 , v has to be treated as a virtual particle , which is severely off its mass - shell .",
    "accordingly , an additional factor @xmath55 , with the vector meson mass @xmath56 , has to be included to obtain the proper normalization . from redefining @xmath57",
    "we generate the standard vdm expression of @xmath58 the vdm amplitude @xmath59 , derived in the quark model , is : @xmath60 which in the limit @xmath61 reduces to the well - known results of @xcite @xmath62 the phase structure of @xmath63 , as determined by @xmath50 , is consistent with the corresponding definitions for the strong transition matrix element .    in the radiative annihilation amplitude ,",
    "the coherent sum of amplitudes for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , arising from different isospin channels , has to be taken .",
    "this gives : @xmath66 where @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the additional @xmath71 accounts for the two possible contributions to the amplitude from an intermediate state with @xmath70 , including a bose - einstein factor . for the decay width of @xmath72",

( [ a14 ] ) of appendix [ appa ] ) : @xmath85 with the interference phase @xmath86 determined by @xmath87 the same equations apply for @xmath88 and @xmath29 with @xmath89 being replaced by the respective meson . here , a kinematical phase space factor @xmath90",

    "similarly , for the branching ratios of @xmath7 @xmath93 , now produced from the spin - singlet state ( j=0 ) of protonium , we obtain : @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the interference determined as @xmath97 again , the sign and size of the interference @xmath98 are fixed by the the initial state interaction , here for protonium states with j=0 .",
    "( [ branpg ] ) , ( [ branrg ] ) and ( [ branog ] ) are analogous to those of ref .",
    "@xcite ; this is also true for eq .",
    "( [ brangg ] ) in the su(3 ) flavor limit with @xmath99 . however , the essential and new feature of the present derivation is that the interference term is completely traced to the distortion in the initial protonium state .",
    "the possibility to link the interference terms @xmath100 to the initial state interaction in protonium is based on the separability of the transition amplitude @xmath101 .",
    "the sign and size of @xmath100 ( j=0,1 ) will have a direct physical interpretation , which will be discussed in the following chapter .",
    "we briefly comment on alternative model descriptions for the strong transition amplitudes @xmath102 and its consequences for the interference terms in radiative @xmath0 decays . competing quark model approaches in the description of @xmath6 annihilation into two mesons concern rearrangement diagrams as opposed to the planar diagram of the a2 prescription of fig .",
    "2a . in the rearrangement model",
    "a quark - antiquark pair of the initial @xmath6 state is annihilated and the remaining quarks rearrange into two mesons .",
    "the quantum numbers of the annihilated quark - antiquark pair are either that of the vacuum ( @xmath103-vertex , r2 model @xcite ) or that of a gluon ( @xmath4-vertex , s2 model @xcite ) . in the r2 model , two ground state mesons",
    "can not be produced from an initial @xmath6 state in a relative s - wave ; hence r2 is not applicable to the annihilation process considered here .",
    "the s2 model generates transition matrix elements for @xmath104 , which are analogous to the ones of the a2 model of eqs .",
    "( [ a2def ] ) and ( [ reduced ] ) , but with different absolute values for the spin - flavor weights @xmath105 @xcite . however , the relative signs of the matrix elements @xmath106 and @xmath107 are identical to the ones of the a2 model , except in the case @xmath108 where it is opposite .",
    "therefore , results for branching ratios @xmath109 of radiative decays expressed in terms of the branching ratios @xmath110 are identical both in the a2 and the s2 approach , except for @xmath111 where @xmath91 changes sign .",
    "but , as will be shown later , the sign structure of @xmath100 deduced in the framework of the a2 model is consistent with the one deduced from experiment .",
    "possible deviations from the formalism presented here include contributions from virtual @xmath112 and @xmath113 states to the annihilation amplitudes as induced by initial state interaction .",
    "the role of @xmath114 state admixture and its effect on @xmath0 annihilation cross sections in the context of quark models was studied in refs .",
    "although contributions involving annihilation from @xmath115 and @xmath116 states can be sizable @xcite , the overall effect on the annihilation cross section is strongly model dependent . in the case of the a2 model @xcite , these contributions are found to be strong for @xmath6 d - wave coupling to channels with a virtual @xmath114 in the s - wave , hence dominantly for the @xmath117 partial wave , where for isospin @xmath118 the tensor force induces strong mixing .",
    "however , for the radiative decay processes at rest considered here , the possible @xmath112 configurations only reside in the @xmath119 state ( here @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) . due to the weak d - wave coupling in the i=1 channel",
    ", @xmath115 configurations play a minor role and are neglected .",
    "alternatively , the strong transition amplitudes @xmath102 can be derived in baryon exchange models @xcite . here",
    "however , the analysis is strongly influenced by the presence both of vector and tensor couplings of the vector mesons to the nucleon , by contributions of both @xmath122 and @xmath114 exchange ( where the latter one contributes to the @xmath123 and @xmath124 channels ) and by the addition of vertex form factors .",
    "the interplay between these additional model dependencies complicates an equivalent analysis . due to simplicity",
    "we restrict the current approach to a certain class of quark models , although deviations from the analysis given below when applying baryon exchange models can not be excluded .",

    "[ isospint ] we focus specifically on the isospin interference effects occuring in radiative transitions .",

    "although the absolute values for the initial state interaction coefficients @xmath41 sensitively depend on the specific value for @xmath158 , variation of @xmath158 by up to 50 % has little influence on sign and also on size of @xmath100 .",

    "( [ van ] ) is more appropriate , it contains an exponential which restricts the importance of each decay channel to the energy region near threshold .",
    "this can be regarded as a manifestation of multichannel unitarity , that is the contribution of a given decay channel can not grow linearly with k ( as in the form of eq .",
