    "the shell structure is one of the fundamental concepts in nuclear physics , which is well described as if the constituent nucleons moved inside the nuclear mean field ( mf ) almost independently . a large energy gap between the single - particle ( s.p . ) orbits in the spherically symmetric mf produces a magic number , _ i.e. _ relative stability of nuclei having a specific proton ( @xmath1 ) or neutron number ( @xmath2 ) , manifesting the shell structure .",
    "it has been disclosed by the experiments using the radioactive beams that the shell structure , and therefore the magic numbers , may depend on @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the magic numbers of nuclei are important in understanding the origin of matters , since elements were synthesized via nuclear reactions which should greatly be influenced by stability of relevant nuclei .",
    "for instance , several peaks in the abundance of elements correspond to the magic numbers of @xmath2 .",
    "the magic numbers of nuclei could also be responsible for the existence limit of superheavy elements that have not yet been observed .    for the @xmath1- and @xmath2-dependence of the shell structure , which is sometimes called _ shell evolution _",
    "@xcite , several possible mechanisms have been pointed out . since the height of the centrifugal barrier depends on the orbital angular momentum @xmath3 of the s.p .",
    "orbits , the s.p .",
    "energies of the loosely bound orbits may have significant @xmath3-dependence , possibly influencing the shell evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , there has been no clear evidence that the @xmath3-dependence of the s.p .",
    "energies gives rise to appearance or disappearance of magic numbers . on the other hand ,",
    "roles of specific channels in the effective nucleonic interaction have been argued .",
    "it has been clarified that the tensor channels are important in the shell evolution  @xcite .",
    "the central spin - isospin channel of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction has also been considered  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 interaction , roles of the three - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction have been investigated  @xcite .    while significance of the tensor force in the shell evolution has been clarified qualitatively in ref .",
    "@xcite , effects of specific channels on magic numbers should be assessed carefully , because in practice magic numbers emerge via interplay of various channels .",
    "one of the authors ( h.n . ) has developed the m3y - type semi - realistic @xmath0 interactions in a series of articles  @xcite . by applying the numerical methods of refs .",
    "@xcite , the self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) and hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) calculations have been implemented with the semi - realistic interactions .",
    "since the interactions explicitly include the tensor force with realistic origin and have reasonable nature on the central spin - isospin channel , the mf approaches employing the semi - realistic interactions provide us with a suitable framework for investigating the magic numbers in wide range of the nuclear chart .",
    "a good example is the s.p .",
    "level inversion observed from @xmath5ca to @xmath6ca , which is reproduced remarkably well by the m3y - type interactions including the realistic tensor force  @xcite . note also that the numerical methods of refs .",
    "@xcite have ability to handle loosely bound orbitals .",
    "the mf calculations with the semi - realistic interactions have been implemented to investigate the shell structure in neutron - rich ca and ni nuclei  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extensively apply the spherical mf approaches with the semi - realistic interactions , particularly the parameter - sets m3y - p6 and p7  @xcite , and predict magic numbers in wide range of the nuclear chart , from relatively light to heavy nuclei including nuclei far off the @xmath7 stability .",
    "as discarded in the conventional mf approaches , tensor - force effects are one of the current hot topics in nuclear structure physics .",
    "we investigate effects of the tensor force and those of the spin - isospin channel by comparing the results to those with the gogny - d1s  @xcite and d1 m  @xcite interactions .",
    "throughout this paper the hamiltonian is taken to be @xmath8 , consisting of the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath9 , the coulomb interaction @xmath10 and the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "the following non - relativistic form is assumed for @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath13^{\\alpha^{(\\mathrm{se } ) } }   + t_\\rho^{(\\mathrm{te } ) } p_\\mathrm{te}\\cdot   [ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_i)]^{\\alpha^{(\\mathrm{te})}}\\big )   \\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_{ij})\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the indices of individual nucleons , @xmath16 with @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) representing the mass of a proton ( a neutron )  @xcite , @xmath19 is the spin operator of the @xmath14-th nucleon , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes the nucleon density .",

    "the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 operators indicate the projection on the singlet - even ( se ) , triplet - even ( te ) , singlet - odd ( so ) and triplet - odd ( to ) two - particle states .",

    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the density - dependent contact term @xmath39 carries certain effects of the @xmath4 interaction and the nuclear medium ( as introduced via the @xmath40-matrix ) , which are significant to reproduce the saturation properties .",
    "it is emphasized that @xmath41 is quite realistic in m3y - p6 and p7 , since it is kept unchanged from the m3y - paris interaction  @xcite which has the @xmath40-matrix origin .",
    "the longest - range part in @xmath42 is also realistic , maintained to be the corresponding term of the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) and denoted by @xmath43 . owing to @xmath43 , the m3y - type interactions have spin - isospin properties consistent with the experimental information  @xcite .",
    "adjusted to the microscopic results of the pure neutron matter  @xcite , m3y - p6 and p7 give reasonable symmetry energy up to its density dependence  @xcite .",
    "definition of magic numbers is not necessarily clear .",
    "experimentally , they have been identified by relative stability ; _ e.g. _ mass irregularity , kink in the separation energies and high excitation energies . from theoretical viewpoints , the magic nature , which is called `` magicity '' ,",
    "is linked to quenching of the many - body correlations .",
    "typically , the spherical hf solution is expected to give a good approximation for the doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the nuclei having either magic @xmath1 or @xmath2 are usually spherical .",
    "for spherical nuclei , the pairing among like nucleons provides dominant correlation beyond the hf .",
    "we shall therefore identify magic numbers ( and submagic numbers ) by comparing the spherical hf and hfb results for even - even nuclei .",
    "the quadrupole deformation can be another source that breaks magicity .",
    "however , both the pair excitation and the quadrupole deformation are driven by quenching of the shell gap in most cases , although strength of the residual interaction associated with the individual correlation is relevant as well .",
    "thus the sizable pair correlation within the spherical hfb could also be a measure of the quadrupole deformation .",
    "conversely , when we view breaking of magicity via the pairing in this study , it does not necessarily indicate that the breakdown takes place due to the pair correlation in actual .",
    "the present work would give informative overview of distribution of magic numbers over the nuclear chart .",
    "although more precise investigation by taking into account the deformation degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) will be desirable , we leave it as a future study which needs intensive calculations .",
    "the magic numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 have been established around the @xmath7 stability line .",
    "these numbers are kept to be magic in certain region , whereas it has been clarified by experiments that the @xmath46 magicity is eroded far off the @xmath7 stability .",
    "as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : magic ] , @xmath47 can also be a good magic number , insensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "we first implement the hf and hfb calculations for even - even nuclei along these numbers .",
    "if we find a good candidate for another magic number , we additionally carry out calculations around it .",
    "since validity of the mf approaches could be questioned in very light nuclei and it is difficult to collect experimental data for extremely heavy nuclei , we restrict ourselves to the nuclei having @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    from the spherical hfb results , we identify @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) to be _ magic _ when the proton ( neutron ) pair correlation vanishes .",
    "we recognize the vanishing pair correlation through the proton ( neutron ) pair energy @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , _ i.e. _ the energy contributed by the proton ( neutron ) pairing tensor in the hfb state .",
    "there are certain cases in which the pair correlation survives , but the hf and the hfb energies , which are denoted by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are very close . in these nuclei correlation effects",
    "are suppressed , resulting in _ e.g. _ relatively high excitation energy .",
    "such suppression takes place particularly when either of @xmath1 or @xmath2 is a good magic number , as has been pointed out for @xmath54ni  @xcite and @xmath55gd  @xcite .",
    "we therefore identify @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) to be _ submagic _ if @xmath56 is smaller than a certain value @xmath57 for @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) nuclei .",
    "we adopt @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the calculations below , independent of @xmath62 .",
    "comparison of the results using different @xmath57 values will exhibit how they are sensitive ( or insensitive ) to @xmath57",
    ".    there could be disputes on the above criterion for the magic and submagic numbers .",
    "it is true that the criterion based solely on the spherical mf calculations is not complete .",
    "we may find influence of quadrupole deformation if comparing the current d1s results to those of the comprehensive deformed hfb calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies have suggested  @xcite that the semi - realistic interactions often give simple picture for appearance and disappearance of the magicity , in good connection to the shell structure under the spherical symmetry",
    ". indeed , prediction of magicity with the semi - realistic interactions is in good harmony with the known data , particularly for relatively light - mass region .",
    "moreover , since quadrupole deformation may quench magicity but can not enhance it , the prediction within the spherical mf regime is useful in selecting candidates and in overviewing how the magic numbers can distribute over the nuclear chart .",
    "there were several works in which the magicity was studied from kinks in the two - proton ( @xmath63 ) or two - neutron ( @xmath64 ) separation energies  @xcite . whereas @xmath63 and @xmath64 are calculable within the spherical hfb calculations , it is not straightforward to draw a quantitative measure for magicity from @xmath63 and @xmath64 that is applicable to wide range of the nuclear chart .",
    "we here comment that the magic and submagic numbers shown below , which are identified from the criterion given above , are compatible with the kinks in the calculated @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "we now show prediction on magic and submagic numbers , which are identified by the criterion given in sec .",
