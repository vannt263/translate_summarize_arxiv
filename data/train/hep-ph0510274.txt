    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has thus far provided an incredibly accurate description of all observed experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , the sm is widely regarded as being a low - energy effective theory , with a limited range of applicability and predictability .",
    "new interactions must arrive at the energy scale of several tev in order to explain such features of the sm as the quark and lepton mass hierarchy .",
    "an intriguing aspect of the sm is that its weak interaction sector represents the only known interaction that distinguishes between the right- and left - handed fermions .",
    "this aspect is addressed in a set of aesthetically - pleasing `` left - right models '' ( lrms ) based on the gauge group @xmath0 , where the left- and right - handed fermion fields are treated symmetrically  @xcite . in such models",
    ", left - right symmetry is broken at some high scale , yielding a parity - violating standard model - like theory at low energies . in typical phenomenological studies of the lrm , the right - handed scale ( i.e.",
    ", the scale at which @xmath2 is broken ) is assumed to be very high , of the order of @xmath3  gev .",
    "such a high energy scale would render direct experimental verification of a lr - motivated scenario impossible in the near future . by way of contrast",
    ", more moderate values for the right - handed scale  in the range 20 - 50 tev , say  could have observable consequences at experiments in the near future  @xcite .",
    "this is the energy range that we shall consider in this work .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in the lrm , in particular , due to the discovery of neutrino oscillations and to major advances in experimental studies of cp - violation in the quark sector . of interest to us in this work",
    "is that the lrm provides a natural process for the suppression of neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism .",
    "lrms also offer additional sources of cp violation , coming both from the right - handed cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) and maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrices as well as from the higgs sector of the theory  @xcite . the cp violation occuring in the leptonic sector of the model could in principle",
    "be of interest within the context of leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the phases in the left - handed mns matrix are currently unconstrained .",
    "as noted above , the lrm contains the natural possibility of implementing the seesaw mechanism for the generation of small neutrino masses . in the simplest version of the seesaw mechanism , only the sm - singlet right - handed neutrinos",
    "are initially allowed to obtain majorana mass terms , resulting in the neutrino mass matrix @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are majorana and dirac mass matrices , respectively , in flavour - space .",
    "this construction , with a block of `` zeros '' where the left - handed majorana mass terms would go , leads to what is sometimes called the `` type i '' seesaw mechanism .",
    "it can be generated in the lrm .",
    "an approximate block - diagonalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nomll ] ) , assuming that the elements in @xmath5 are much larger than those in @xmath6 , leads to the standard seesaw expression for the light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath7 .    to implement the seesaw mechanism in the lrm ,",
    "one introduces a right - handed higgs triplet field , @xmath8 , into the theory . the field @xmath8 serves a dual purpose ",
    "it breaks the left - right symmetry of the model at a high scale and it also couples to majorana neutrino fields , giving rise to the right - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath5 required for the seesaw mechanism .",
    "@xmath5 is proportional to the right - handed symmetry breaking scale , making it naturally large .",
    "left - right symmetry also requires the existence of a left - handed higgs triplet field , @xmath9 .",
    "the neutral components of the left- and right - handed triplet fields both generically obtain a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) under spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath10 .",
    "lrms also typically contain a bidoublet field , @xmath11 , with vevs at the weak scale .",
    "the role played by @xmath11 is similar to that played by the usual higgs doublet of the sm .",
    "in contrast with the situation in the type i seesaw mechanism , lrms generically also contain a non - zero left - handed majorana mass matrix for neutrinos , @xmath12 .",
    "this mass matrix is proportional to @xmath13 ( the vev associated with the left - handed higgs triplet ) and @xmath13 need not be zero .",
    "there is , in fact , a seesaw - like relation among the vevs @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the lrm that arises due to terms in the higgs potential that couple @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( @xmath15 , for example ) .",
    "if all dimensionless coefficients in the higgs potential are of order unity , one finds that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a dimensionful quantity of order the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "the situation @xmath18 ( and hence @xmath19 ) can be obtained by dropping the offending terms from the higgs potential , although attempts to disallow the terms using a symmetry meet with difficulties  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of a non - zero matrix @xmath20 in the `` zero '' block of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nomll ] ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:6by6 ] ) below ) leads to the `` type ii '' seesaw mechanism  @xcite , yielding the following approximate mass matrix for light neutrinos , @xmath21 with @xmath12 generically of order @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "experimentally , the terms in @xmath24 must be at most of order about 0.1  ev . if the largest terms in @xmath6 are taken to be of order @xmath25 , and if @xmath12 does not undergo any further suppression , then the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnu1 ] ) dominates and sets the minimum scale @xmath14 that is phenomenologically viable .",
    "taking @xmath17 to be of order the weak scale we find that @xmath14 would need to be at least of order @xmath26  gev in this case , ruling out any possibility of observing lr - induced effects at collider experiments .",
    "the analogous lower bound coming from the second term alone ( type i seesaw ) is of order @xmath3  gev if one assumes @xmath27 .",
    "a few approaches have been suggested for reducing the right - handed scale @xmath14 while simultaneously satisfying phenomenological constraints within the context of type ii models .",
    "one approach is to suppress @xmath12 by separating the parity and gauge symmetry breaking scales .",
    "for instance , one can introduce a pseudoscalar higgs field @xmath28 that acquires a vacuum expectation value ( thereby breaking parity ) at a very high scale , while allowing the right - handed gauge symmetry to be broken at a much lower scale  @xcite this approach could lead to interesting phenomenology . in such a model , @xmath29 , so that the left - handed majorana mass terms could be of an acceptable size provided that @xmath30 were sufficiently high .    another promising approach for bringing @xmath14 down to a potentially observable scale is to introduce an extra @xmath31 horizontal symmetry that is broken by a small parameter @xmath32  @xcite . in this approach , each field in the model is assigned a charge under the horizontal symmetry .",
    "yukawa couplings and the dimensionless coefficients in the higgs potential are then suppressed by various powers of @xmath32 , with the powers depending on combinations of charge assignments .",
    "in addition to providing a nice dynamical mechanism for producing the observed hierarchies in the charged lepton masses , this approach also allows for a significant reduction in the right - handed scale @xmath14 . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , an appropriate choice of charge assignments leads to a suppression of @xmath13 , thereby suppressing @xmath12 .",
    "there is a similar suppression of the yukawa couplings involved in @xmath6 , the net effect of which is to loosen the stringent lower bounds on @xmath14 .    in this work",
    "we perform an indepth numerical study of neutrinos in a left - right model that is supplemented by such a broken @xmath31 horizontal symmetry .",
    "the goal of the paper is to determine the parameter space of the model already constrained by the neutrino mass and mixing measurements .",
    "we focus on the case in which the right - handed symmetry breaking scale is only `` moderately '' large ( 20 - 50  tev ) . in the horizontal symmetry scheme , right - handed scales as low as 20",
    "tev can in fact lead to results consistent with neutrino phenomenology .",
    "the numerical procedure also yields results for the right - handed neutrino masses and mixings and the various cp - violating phases . throughout this work",
    "we assume that there are three generations of light neutrinos and ignore the possibility of light sterile neutrinos .",
    "we also assume the `` normal '' ordering of neutrino masses , @xmath33 .",
