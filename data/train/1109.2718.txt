    "this is a report about the pion - photon transition form factor  an observable that is considered to be the prime example of an exclusive process in qcd because in leading order ( lo ) the partonic interactions are purely electrodynamic , with the strong interactions being factorized out into the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) . while the accuracy of the cello data @xcite was not sufficient to provide a proof - of - concept of the qcd framework , the appearance of the cleo data @xcite established the validity of the collinear factorization of this process @xcite",
    "this situation changed dramatically in the year 2009 when the collaboration published new data @xcite with very small error bars at intermediate momentum transfers reaching values just below @xmath5  gev@xmath2unreachable in the past  with still tolerable errors .",
    "these data for the scaled form factor @xmath6 exhibit two distinctive features : ( i ) the earlier data taken by cleo at the _ same _ momentum - transfer values were confirmed , but with a higher accuracy .",
    "( ii ) unexpectedly , the data starting above @xmath7  gev@xmath2 and extending up to about @xmath5  gev@xmath2 do not scale with @xmath8 .",
    "instead , they show a clear general tendency to rapidly grow with @xmath8 , with the exception of two single data points at about 14  gev@xmath2 and 27  gev@xmath2 that lie just below the asymptotic prediction of perturbative qcd @xcite : @xmath9 . understanding the underlying enhancement mechanism(s ) , responsible for this behavior , is of significant importance because an increasing form factor challenges the basic concepts of qcd , like collinear factorization .",
    "the recent analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , reported here , builds on light - cone sum rules ( lcsr)s by taking into account various contributions from perturbative and nonperturbative qcd and by utilizing in the analysis data sets from different experiments @xcite for momentum - transfer values ranging from 1 to 40  gev@xmath2 .",
    "emphasis is given to the statistical features and the way they depend on the various theoretical parameters .",
    "the main goal is the confrontation of theoretical predictions , obtained with the help of light - cone sum rules ( lcsr)s , with all available experimental data for the pion - photon transition form factor .",
    "in addition , the results are compared with the data @xcite for the @xmath10- and @xmath11-photon transition form factors making use of the description of the @xmath12 mixing in the quark flavor basis @xcite that involves the state @xmath13 .",
    "this makes it possible to link the @xmath14 transition form factor , multiplied by @xmath15 , to the form factor @xmath16 , where the prefactor arises from the quark charges .",
    "the method of light - cone sum rules , developed in @xcite for the pion - photon transition form factor , but not only @xcite , has been refined by years of experience in many analyses @xcite .",
    "it contains a set of rules that encode a computational model and as any model it encodes _ implicit _ predictions that turn _",
    "explicit _ under some justified assumptions about its inherent ( and auxiliary ) parameters .",
    "the subtlety is how to adjust these parameters in such a way as to achieve the best possible accuracy of the obtained predictions with respect to the experimental data while avoiding sensitivity on particular values .",
    "the modus operandi of the lcsrs for the pion - photon transition form factor is expressed by @xcite @xmath17 \\ , , \\label{eq : lcsr - ff}\\ ] ] where the abbreviations @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been used , and with the spectral density @xmath20 taken with next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) accuracy .",
    "the hadronic threshold in the vector - meson channel has the value @xmath21",
    "gev@xmath2 , @xmath22 is the borel parameter , and @xmath23  gev denotes the physical mass of the @xmath24 meson .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : lcsr - ff ] ) stems from the hadronic content of a quasireal photon at low @xmath25 , while the second one resembles its pointlike behavior at higher @xmath26 .",
    "the main advantage of employing lcsrs is that one starts with the situation where both photon virtualities are sufficiently large , so that perturbation theory is safely applicable , and approaches the asymmetric kinematics with @xmath8 fixed and large and @xmath27 via a dispersion relation : @xmath28 where the physical spectral density @xmath29 approaches at large @xmath30 the perturbative one : @xmath31 the form factor @xmath32 can be calculated via perturbative qcd having recourse to collinear factorization , meaning that it can be written in the convolution form @xcite @xmath33 where the pion decay constant is @xmath34  mev and @xmath35 is the twist - four coupling .",
    "all nonperturbative information of the bound state is encapsulated in the coefficients @xmath36 that are incalculable within perturbation theory and have to be modeled , or be computed on the lattice , e.g. , @xcite , via the moments @xmath37 with the normalization condition @xmath38 .",
    "the leading twist - two pion da fulfills an evolution equation @xcite and can be expressed in terms of the gegenbauer polynomials @xmath39 to read @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the asymptotic pion da  @xcite .",
    "the cornerstones of the analysis in @xcite , on which this report is based , are :    * nlo radiative corrections : they are taken into account in the spectral density @xcite , after correcting the error pointed out in @xcite , and using @xmath43 to avoid ( large ) logarithms of these scales .",
    "they are negative leading to suppression of the transition form factor .",
    "* twist - four contributions : they are included via the coupling @xmath44 $ ]  gev@xmath2 and performing one - loop evolution assuming the asymptotic form for the twist - four pion da : @xmath45 .",
    "[ nonasymptotic forms were found before to be of minor importance . ]",
    "these contributions are also negative and yield suppression .",
    "* evolution of the coefficients @xmath36 : they are included at the nlo level of accuracy , using the qcd scale parameters @xmath46  mev and @xmath47  mev , and provide suppression .",
    "* nnlo@xmath48 ( for next - to - next - to - leading ) radiative corrections @xcite and twist - six contributions @xcite : they are taken into account implicitly in terms of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this is justified because for the average value of @xmath49  gev@xmath2 , used in our analysis @xcite , the net result of adding these ( not large ) terms is small , decreasing with @xmath8 from @xmath50 at @xmath51  gev@xmath2where the positive twist - six term prevails  down to @xmath52 at @xmath53  gev@xmath2where the negative nnlo correction becomes stronger .",
    "note that for @xmath54  gev@xmath2 @xcite , the twist - six term becomes negligible , while nnlo@xmath48 still provides suppression .",
    "* inclusion of resonances : a finite - width breit - wigner form is adopted in the spectral density in order to resolve the @xmath24 and @xmath55 resonances @xcite .",
    "this entails a small enhancement of the transition form factor as compared to the @xmath56-function ansatz .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] illustrates the approximate composition of the pion - photon transition form factor .",
    "we now have all the elements for the data analysis . in order to get the most output from the data for the pion - photon transition form factor @xcite and achieve the best insight about the particular role and relative strength of the first three gegenbauer coefficients @xmath57",
    ", we divide the data into two sets : ( a ) @xmath58 $ ]  gev@xmath2termed ` cleo regime ' and ( b ) @xmath1 $ ]  gev@xmath2`entire range ' .",
    "the results of the statistical 3-d analysis of these data sets are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]upper part  in the left and right panel , respectively , using the central value @xmath59  gev@xmath2 of the twist - four coupling .",
    "both panels show the corresponding @xmath60 ellipsoids which are characterized by their principal axes and ellipses .",
    "the projection of the @xmath60 ellipsoid on the plane @xmath61 is represented , in both panels , by the larger ellipse enclosed by a solid line in red color .",
    "the smaller enclosed ellipse in the left panel denotes the cross section of the ellipsoid with the @xmath61 plane , whereas the shaded ( green ) rectangle shows the region in the @xmath61 plane allowed by nonlocal qcd sum rules @xcite , with the point in the center ( marked by ) denoting the bakulev - mikhailov - stefanis ( bms ) pion da @xcite .",
    "the profile of this da exhibits a double - humped structure with suppressed endpoints @xmath62 due to the use of nonlocal condensates @xcite  see also @xcite for a discussion of the endpoint region of the pion da .",
    "all results are shown at the scale @xmath63 after nlo evolution . performing the analysis with the second data set ( upper right panel ) , entails a sizeable coefficient @xmath64 , so that the @xmath60 ellipsoid is lifted off the plane @xmath61 , while its projection remains almost the same as in the left panel .",
    "remarkably , it still overlaps with the shaded rectangle containing the bms model and the constraints from nonlocal qcd sum rules @xcite .           attempting to understand more quantitatively how the twist - four contribution affects our results , we concentrate on the @xmath61 plane and present our findings in the lower part of fig .  [ fig:2 ] in terms of @xmath60 ellipses .",
    "these are calculated by varying the @xmath35 coupling from 0.15 to 0.19 to 0.23  gev@xmath2 and then merging the obtained @xmath60 error ellipses together to form the distorted ellipses shown in this graphics .",
    "left panel ( ` cleo regime ' ) : the largest ellipse  dashed ( red ) line  results from combining the projections on the plane @xmath61 of the 3-d data analysis discussed before .",
    "the smaller ellipse ( solid blue line ) shows the outcome of a 2-d analysis by means of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "its middle point with the coordinates @xmath67 and @xmath68 almost coincides with the center of the rectangle from @xcite .",
    "finally , the smallest ellipse ( thick solid line ) , entirely enclosed by the previous one , is obtained by unifying the intersections with the @xmath61 plane of all ellipsoids generated by the variation around the central value of @xmath69  gev@xmath2 .",
    "right panel ( ` entire range ' ) : including into the statistical analysis the high-@xmath8 tail of the data modifies this picture completely .",
    "now the composed error ellipse resulting from the 2-d analysis ( solid blue line ) moves out of the region of the negative values of @xmath66characteristic of the bms models @xcite  entering the positive domain .",
    "this entails a significantly worse value @xmath70 , relative to the value @xmath71 for the ` cleo - regime ' data set . on the other hand ,",
    "the unified @xmath60 error ellipse of the 3-d projections on the @xmath61 plane ( larger dashed red ellipse ) keeps its position fixed still enclosing the major part of the @xmath65 , @xmath66 values obtained from nonlocal qcd sum rules ( shaded rectangle in green color ) .",
    "confronting these results with lattice estimates reveals that the 3-d projected error ellipse lies almost entirely within the boundaries from @xcite ( dashed vertical lines ) , even intersecting for the larger values of @xmath65 with the narrower interval determined in @xcite ( dashed - dotted vertical lines ) .",
    "in contrast to the left panel , the ellipse of the 2-d analysis for the entire set of data only poorly complies with the small @xmath65 window of @xcite , while partly overlapping with the low end of the @xmath65 range determined in @xcite . for comparison , some characteristic pion das are also shown in fig .  [ fig:2 ] : asymptotic da ( ) ; chernyak - zhitnitsky ( cz ) model @xcite ( ) ; projection of model iii from @xcite ( ) .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the calculated pion - photon transition form factor @xcite in comparison with various sets of data , specified in the caption .",
    "the graphics in the left panel displays the theoretical results in the form of `` data '' at the same momentum - transfer values as the experimental data and with theoretical uncertainties included as error bars ",
    "see table i in the first work of ref .",
    "@xcite for the numerics .",
    "the right panel serves to effect the large-@xmath8 behavior of the scaled form factor  therefore , a logarithmic scale .",
    "the shaded green strip embodies the predictions obtained in @xcite , as described above .",
    "one observes : ( i ) the shaded strip fits the cello , cleo and the ` cleo regime ' set of the data very precisely ( overall @xmath72 ) .",
    "( ii ) the prediction approaches asymptotically the limit @xmath73 from below and agrees very well with the data for the @xmath4 transition form factor , being in conflict with the steep rise of the data for @xmath6 above 9  gev@xmath2 .",
    "( iii ) the lcsr predictions of @xcite ( single solid blue lines ) are not really reproducing the behavior of the data , despite the opposite claims by the authors and the use of pion das with a high number of harmonics .",
    "in fact , the reinforcement of the form factor can only be achieved by an enhancement of the endpoint region @xmath62 of the pion da , with the best agreement being provided by the flattop da which includes all @xmath74 values in an equal amount , inevitably entailing a worse fit to the data in the ` cleo regime ' and below ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "to conclude , we can not _ predict _ the rise of the scaled pion - photon transition form factor , observed by the collaboration , using the standard scheme of qcd . nor can we _ explain _ it in hindsight within the same context  despite opposite claims in @xcite and elsewhere @xcite . therefore , the data are unpredictable in qcd , but they are not unexplainable  in particular contexts which , however , are contingent on assumptions that can hardly be accommodated within the standard scheme of qcd .",
    "moreover , there is a dichotomy of the pseudoscalar meson sector into two very disparate groups , one obeying the qcd asymptotics , the other not , depending on the particular shape of the pion da . indeed , for bms - like models ( double - humped and endpoint - suppressed ) @xcite",
    ", the predictions completely agree with the cello @xcite and _ all _ data in the ` cleo region ' @xcite for the pion - photon transition form factor , as well as with the data @xcite for the @xmath75-photon transition form factor , while being in strong disagreement with the data @xcite for the @xmath76-photon form factor above 9  gev@xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "using a flatlike da @xcite ( which describes an unrealistic pointlike pion ) reproduces the @xmath3 data but fails to comply with those on the @xmath75-photon transition leading to predictions above the experimental data @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these findings indicate a possible strong violation of the isospin symmetry in the pseudoscalar meson sector ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) that has not been observed in other measurements so far .",
    "therefore , the reproducibility of the results for the pion - photon transition form factor by other experiments ( e.g. , by belle ) is of paramount importance .",
