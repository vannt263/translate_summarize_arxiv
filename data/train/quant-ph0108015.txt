    "as it is common in pattern formation processes @xcite the instability develops with a definite critical wave number @xmath30 , which characterizes the periodicity of the pattern immediately above the instability threshold . the critical point for the onset of the modulational instability",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath31 , the kerr nonlinearity selects a discrete set of six wave vectors @xcite , so that immediately above the critical point the near field intensity distribution consists of a hexagonal lattice of bright spots , while the far field shows a central bright spot surrounded by six spots in hexagonal arrangement .",
    "the origin of this particular pattern can be understood by considering the microscopic processes leading to off - axis emission of photons allowed by energy - momentum conservation @xcite . by referring to the scheme of figure  [ fig2]a , a first process that preserves the radiation transverse momentum involves destruction of two photons of the plane - wave input beam , and creation of two photons propagating off - axis in symmetrical directions .",
    "this is the only possible process in a 1-d version of this model @xcite , and would lead to the formation of a stripe pattern in the near field , as e.g. predicted by a vectorial model for a self - defocusing kerr medium @xcite , or in the case of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator @xcite . in this system , however , the stripe pattern is unstable , because secondary four - wave mixing processes can take place . by referring to figure  [ fig2 ] , we can e.g. consider destruction of one on - axis photon of the input beam and one photon propagating in direction 1 , and creation of two off - axis photons propagating in directions 2 and 6 . by considering also the symmetric process , that involves destruction of a photon in mode 4 and one in the on - axis mode , and creation of two photons in mode 3 and 6 , respectively",
    ", we see that the six off - axis hexagonal modes are activated .",
    "close to the threshold for pattern formation , all the other processes allowed by energy - momentum conservation , that do not involve on - axis photons , can be neglected , because off - axis mode intensities are much weaker than that of the on - axis homogeneous mode , where the pump beam is injected .",
    "the microscopic processes which generate the hexagonal pattern are at the origin of non - classical correlation among different portions of the far - field cross section . referring to the example of figure  [ fig2 ]",
    ", it can be noticed that whenever two photons are detected at positions 2 and 3 in the far field , there must be two other photons at position 5 and 6 , which suggests the existence of a high level of correlation between the sum of photon numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the same reasoning can be applied to any symmetric group of four spots ) .",
    "a more quantitative argument for the existence of such a kind of intensity correlation in the hexagonal pattern was given by grynberg and lugiato@xcite .",
    "they considered a discrete model for the hexagonal pattern formation in kerr media , which takes into account only the six hexagonal modes plus the homogeneous mode @xmath34 , valid close to the threshold for pattern formation , where these modes gives the most relevant contribution to the system dynamics . by considering a quantization box in the transverse plane of side @xmath35 ( @xmath36 at the end of the calculations ) they set a(,t ) = a_0 ( t ) + _",

    "if there are no photons in the hexagonal modes at the crystal entrance , perfect correlation is found at the exit between e.g. @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "however , when the crystal is inserted in an open resonator , the field is recycled by the cavity and dissipation through the cavity input / output mirror should be taken into account . as a matter of fact",
    ", the release of a photon out of the cavity mirror is a random process uncorrelated with the nonlinear processes taking place in the crystal , so that one would expect that cavity dissipation is detrimental for this kind of correlation .",
    "however , we will now show that this is not the case . in order to elucidate this point ,",
    "we shall follow two different techniques .",
    "the standard one , which will be employed in the next section , makes use of the small quantum noise approximation , and consists of linearizing the dynamics of quantum fluctuations around a classical steady state .",
    "the other one consists of trying to solve the non - linear langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the photon number operators of the hexagonal modes .",
    "these equations take the general form ( see e.g. @xcite ) n_i = -2 n_i + + [ dndt ] with @xmath47 being noise operators modelling the vacuum input fluctuations on @xmath48-th mode .",
    "they obey standard free - field commutation rules = _ i , j ( t - t ) [ incomm ] and have the noticeable commutator with a generic intracavity operator @xmath49 @xcite = ( t - t ) , [ causality ] where @xmath50 is the step function .",

    "the second term at rhs of the dynamical equations ( [ dndt ] ) is therefore a complicated expression , involving third order products of mode operators , so that finding an explicit solution seems unlikely .",
    "however , when considering the combination of mode photon numbers @xmath44 given by eq.([n _ ] ) the dynamics drastically simplify : n_- & = & -2 n_- - + g_- , + & = & -2 n_- + g_- , [ dn - dt ] where we used the fact that @xmath44 commutes with the system hamiltonian , and the operator @xmath61 is defined as : g_-&= & a_i^a_i^in + a_i^ in a_i + a_i1 ^a_i1 ^in + a_i1 ^ in a_i1   + & & - ( a_i3^a_i3 ^in + a_i3 ^ in a_i3 ) - ( a_i4 ^a_i4 ^in + a_i4 ^ in a_i4 ) [ g- ] when the input operators of the hexagonal modes are in the vacuum state , @xmath62 . moreover , by using    \\i ) the commutation relations of input operators ,    \\ii ) the causality relations expressed by eq .",

    "@xmath65 , we get n_-^out ( ) = 2n_- ( ) + n_-^in ( ) - g_- ( ) = g_- ( ) + n_-^in ( ) . the fluctuation spectrum of the output photon number combination @xmath66 can now be calculated as : v_- ( ) = d t n_-^out(t ) n_-^out ( 0)e^i t= n_+ ( 1 - ) , [ lorentzian ] where @xmath67 . hence the noise spectrum of @xmath68 turns out to have a standard lorentzian shape @xcite , with the lorentzian dip well below the shot - noise level represented by @xmath69 .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the '  twin beam  correlation spectrum calculated for the down - converted fields generated by a parametric oscillator without spatial aspects @xcite . as a matter of fact , in the case of twin beam generation , the photon number difference between the two beams has zero commutator with the system hamiltonian .",
    "the calculation of the noise spectrum of the number difference may be performed following exactly the same steps outlined here , and it is not a coincidence that the result turns out to be the same . however , in contrast to the more standard method of analysis , which exploits the small quantum noise limit by linearizing the model equations around a classical steady - state , the method used here is ",
    "exact \" , because it takes into account the full nonlinearity , and does not depend on the particular steady state chosen .    in this connection",
    "it should be noted that our result concerning spatial intensity correlation in the hexagonal pattern is valid both above and below the threshold for pattern formation , where there is no classical pattern at all .",
    "off - axis emission of photons is here generated purely by quantum fluctuations ; on average translational and rotational symmetry are preserved , so that off - axis photons can be emitted in any direction . however , the mechanism of photon absorption and emission is such to preserve the transverse radiation momentum ; as a consequence any six regions in hexagonal arrangement with arbitrary orientation in the far field plane display exactly the same kind of intensity correlation that we have described above threshold .",
    "incidentally , it is worth noting that the same method can be applied to analyze the quantum spatial correlation in the far field plane of the down - converted field emitted by a optical parametric oscillator , where under proper circumstances the downconverted field is emitted in the form of two plane waves slightly tilted with respect to the cavity longitudinal axis  @xcite . by interference",
    "these two waves give rise in the near field to a stripe pattern , while the far - field intensity distribution consists of two symmetrical spots . from a microscopic point of view ,",
    "the most relevant three - wave - mixing process close to threshold involves destruction of a pump photon that propagates longitudinally , and creation of two down - converted photons propagating in symmetrical directions , as it is required by transverse momentum conservation .",
    "hence , the two off - axis signal waves emitted above threshold are made of twin photons and the photon numbers @xmath70 that cross in the unit time two ideal detectors surroundings the two spots in the far field plane are highly correlated @xcite . in the framework of a three - mode - model , valid close to threshold , a calculation analogous to that performed in the case of hexagons shows that the noise spectrum of their difference @xmath71 is given exactly by the formula ( [ lorentzian ] ) .",
    "a last interesting remark is the following : in the kerr cavity model , when the quantum fluctuation dynamics is linearized around the homogeneous steady - state below threshold , intensity correlation is found between any two symmetric wave - vectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 close to the critical circle , just as in the case of parametric down - conversion",
    ". hence the linear analysis does not give any hint about the existence of a hexagonal pattern above threshold , with its quantum correlations .",
    "this is not in contradiction with our result , since quantum correlation between two symmetric modes obviously implies a noise reduction in the observable @xmath44 connecting two couples of symmetric modes .",
    "however , the inverse is not in general true .",
    "since the intensity difference between symmetric modes is not a constant of motion of the full hamiltonian , we expect that the level of correlation between symmetric modes decreases when approaching the region where linearization fails , that is , in the neighbourhood of the instability point , where the size of fluctuations increases , or for a truly microscopic system characterized by a small saturation photon number parameter . on the contrary",
    ", our non - linear analysis shows that the correlations which are at the origin of noise suppression in @xmath44 do not depend on the distance from theshold or on the system size .",
    "in the previous section it has been demonstrated a high level of intensity correlation in groups of four among the hexagonal modes .",
    "a natural question which arises is whether there exist any other kind of correlation among the six modes at the quantum level .",
    "this possibility is suggested by the example of twin beams generation .",
    "in fact , in this case , not only the photon number fluctuations are correlated , but also the  phase \" fluctuations of the two beams are anti - correlated at a quantum level . to be more precise , there exist two orthogonal field quadratures of the two beams which show , at the same time , a high level of ( anti)correlation . this is at the origin of the epr aspects of the twin beams @xcite , which are widely exploited in the field of quantum information with continuous variables ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "since we do not have in mind other constant of motion ( other observable commuting with the hamiltonian ) , we have to resort to traditional means of calculations .",
    "namely , in the framework of the seven - mode discrete model ( [ expansion ] ) , we separate the quantum fluctuation operator from the classical mean field a_i(t)= _ i + a_i ( t ) i=0,1 ,  6 [ small ] where @xmath74 are the classical steady state amplitudes of the seven mode . more precisely , they are the steady state solution of a set of classical dynamical equation , obtained by introducing in eq.([eqll ] ) the discrete expansion of the envelope operator @xmath75 .",
    "these equations have the form : @xmath76 where we took into account the fact that all the hexagonal modes have the same critical transverse wave number , such that @xmath77 .",
    "by inserting the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) into the model equation ( [ aeq ] ) , with the ansatz ( [ small ] ) , and keeping only the leading terms in the small quantum fluctuations we are left with a problem of the form (    c a_0 +   + a_6 + a_0^ +   + a_6^    ) = (    c + 14 14 +   +   +   +   + ( _ 0,_0^ *  , _ 6,_6^ * ) +    ) (    c a_0 +   + a_6 + a_0^ +   + a_6^    ) + (    c a_0^in +   + a_6^in + a_0^ in +   + a_6^ in    ) , [ linear ] where the explicit form of the matrix elements in terms of the classical steady state amplitudes @xmath78 is given in appendix a. the input fluctuation operators at rhs are in the vacuum state and have commutation relations as those in eq.([incomm ] ) .",

    "it is worth noting that the quadrature corresponding to the hexagonal mode stationary phase @xmath124 satisfies a simple equation @xmath135 which gives a lorentzian shape spectrum @xmath136 taking into account that now the shot - noise level is scaled to 1 , this is in perfect agreement with the results of section ii , since @xmath137 represents the linearized version of the observable @xmath44 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that , differently with respect to the previous cases , for this combination of modes the low frequency noise reduction abruptly disappears when the quadrature is slightly rotated with respect to the amplitude quadrature . in fact",
    ", as shown by figure [ fig6 ] , a large positive peak located at zero frequency appears on the lorentzian spectrum when the quadrature angle is shifted from @xmath124 .",

    "is predicted at zero frequency for @xmath138 ( the amplitude quadrature ) , in the whole region where the hexagonal solution exists .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the quantum features underlying the hexagonal pattern formation in a kerr cavity .",
    "we have identified a rich scenario of purely quantum correlations among the off axis modes that form the hexagonal pattern .",
    "in fact we have shown that at least five independent combinations of mode observables exhibit sub shot - noise fluctuations .",
    "we believe that the six - mode entanglement analysed in this paper might be of great interest . on the one side this kind of patterns",
    "are widely studied in labs , so that it should be easy to look for the described quantum effects . on the other side ,",
    "the quantum properties of such systems make them good candidates for quantum information processing with continuous variable @xcite .",
    "in particular , the existence of several observables showing correlations at the quantum level opens the possibility of distilling a considerable amount of entanglement in practical situations , and to use it .    in this connection",
    "an interesting question is whether this kind of spatial entanglement is characteristic of the particular model analysed here , or it is in general typical of the hexagonal pattern , independently of the detailed mechanism that underlie its formation .",
    "further investigations about models closer to experimental situations where hexagons heve been found are hence in order .",
    "an other interesting point concerns the possibility that some squeezing is missing from our picture .",
    "the symmetry of the problem suggests the possibility that quantum correlations - more probably anti - correlations - exist between the the sum of all hexagonal modes and the pump mode .",
    "this would be closely similar to the situation analysed in @xcite , in the context of a self - defocusing kerr cavity , where quantum anticorrelations were found between the pump on - axis intensity and the intensities of two symmetrical off - axis modes .",
    "a final open question is whether these quantum correlations survive when including in the model the full continuum of transverse modes . as a matter of fact ,",
    "being the bifurcation subcritical , the hexagonal mode emerges at threshold with a finite amplitude .",
    "hence higher order spatial harmonics might have a non - negligible amplitude evening in the neighbourhood of the threshold , and photon scattering in these additional modes might spoil our correlations .",
    "this will be the subject of future numerical investigations .",
