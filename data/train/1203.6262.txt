    "the notion of entanglement is now one of the key research topics of quantum physics and considered as the main resources for quantum information and quantum computation theory .",
    "one of the most basic research topics in the theory of entanglement is how to distinguish entanglement from separable states .",
    "we recall that a state on the tensor product @xmath0 is said to be separable if it is the convex combination of product states , where @xmath1 denotes the @xmath2-algebra of all @xmath3 matrices over the complex field .",
    "if we identify a state on @xmath0 as a density matrix in @xmath0 , then a density matrix is separable if and only if it is the convex sum of rank one projections onto product vectors .",
    "a density matrix in @xmath0 is entangled if it is not separable .",
    "it was observed by choi @xcite and peres @xcite that the partial transpose of a separable density matrix is again positive semi - definite .",
    "this ppt criterion gives us a very simple necessary condition for separability among various criteria for separability .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the notion of ppt states turns out be to very important in itself in relation with bound entanglement .",
    "see @xcite .    in order to distinguish entanglement from separability , it is important to understand the boundary structures of the convex cone @xmath4 generated by all separable states .",
    "we note that the boundary @xmath5 of the cone @xmath4 consists of maximal faces .",
    "we also note that the ppt criterion tells us that the cone @xmath4 is contained in the convex cone @xmath6 generated by all ppt states .",
    "therefore , we have the two cases for a maximal face @xmath7 of @xmath4 :    * @xmath7 is contained in the boundary @xmath8 of the cone @xmath6 , * the interior @xmath9 of @xmath7 is contained in @xmath10 .",
    "although the first case is easy to characterize using the boundary structures @xcite of the cone @xmath6 , there is nothing to be known for the second case .",
    "even , there is no known explicit examples of separable states on the boundary @xmath5 of @xmath4 , but in the interior of the cone @xmath6 , to the best knowledge of the authors .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to exhibit such examples in the case of @xmath11 , and investigate the geometric structures of the maximal faces determined by those examples . as a byproduct of those examples ,",
    "we naturally get examples of entangled states with positive partial transposes whose ranges are full spaces .    note that every point @xmath12 of a convex set @xmath13 determines the smallest face containing the point .",
    "this is the unique face of @xmath13 in which @xmath12 is an interior point . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a general method how to understand the face of the cone @xmath4 determined by a given separable state . after we give examples of separable states in @xmath14 in section 3",
    ", we analyze the faces determined by them in the last two sections . throughout this note",
    ", a vector @xmath15 will be considered as a column vector , and we denote by @xmath16 and @xmath17 the complex conjugate and the hermitian conjugate of @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "so @xmath18 is the one dimensional projection onto the vector @xmath15 with this notation , whenever @xmath15 is a unit vector .",
    "the convex cone @xmath6 consists of positive semi - definite matrices @xmath19 in @xmath0 whose partial transpose @xmath20 is also positive semi - definite , where @xmath21 is the usual matrix units in @xmath22 .",
    "we recall that a convex subset @xmath7 of a convex set @xmath13 is said to be a face of @xmath13 if the following property holds : @xmath23 in short , if an interior point of a line segment lies in the face @xmath7 then the whole line segment should lie in @xmath7 .",
    "the faces of the convex cone @xmath6 are determined @xcite by pairs @xmath24 of subspaces of @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , every face of @xmath6 is of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the range space of @xmath28 .",
    "we also note that the interior of the face @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 we recall that a point @xmath12 of a convex set @xmath13 is an interior point of @xmath13 if the line segment from any point of @xmath13 to @xmath12 can be extended within @xmath13 .",
    "a point of @xmath13 which is not an interior point is said to be a boundary point .",
