    "<S> , we have demonstrated that vacuum birefringence can be verified experimentally with state of the art technology . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea to making this phenomenon experimentally accessible is to exploit the scattering of @xmath133-polarized photons out of the cone of the incident probe x - ray beam . for the treatment of realistic laser fields , it is computationally efficient to reformulate vacuum birefringence as vacuum emission @xcite , and employ new theoretical insights into photon propagation in slowly varying inhomogeneous fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are optimistic that our study can pave the way for an experimental verification of vacuum birefringence in an all - optical experiment . </S>",
