    "canonical analysis  la dirac is a straightforward , if sometimes labyrinthine , approach to counting a system s physical degrees of freedom ( dof ) in the presence of gauge symmetries and non - linear interactions .",
    "however , this approach can uncover unexpected subtleties , as already exemplified by some toy models in @xcite . in this paper , we show that more physically motivated theories can also contain similar subtleties , with qualitatively important consequences .",
    "our focus will be on a specific self - interacting spin-2 gravity model , but similar effects may well arise in other interacting theories with higher - spin gauge symmetries , at least if some ( listed ) necessary conditions are met .",
    "the theory we shall study in detail is the truncation of @xmath0 `` nmg '' @xcite to its pure quadratic curvature , yet ghost - free , part @xcite , @xmath1= \\frac{1}{16}\\int { \\operatorname{d}\\!}^3x\\sqrt{-g}\\ , \\left[g^{\\mu\\nu}g_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac12\\,g^2 \\right ] = \\frac{1}{16}\\int { \\operatorname{d}\\!}^3x\\sqrt{-g}\\ , g_{\\mu\\nu}s^{\\mu\\nu } , \\quad s_{\\mu\\nu } : = r_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac14 g_{\\mu\\nu}r\\ , ;   \\label{eq : action2}\\ ] ] here @xmath2 is the einstein tensor , @xmath3 is its trace and @xmath4 is the @xmath0 schouten tensor .",
    "we have set an overall dimensional constant to unity and used mostly plus signature .",
    "this model provides a remarkable example of symmetry - breaking through the clash between its two local , conformal and coordinate , invariances .",
    "their co - existence at linearized level underlies this fourth derivative metric system s `` miraculous '' transmutation into single ghost - free vector excitation , or equivalently to a propagating torsion with non - propagating metric .",
    "nonlinearly , however , conformal- is necessarily sacrificed to coordinate - invariance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ se:2 ] we perform the hamiltonian analysis . in section [ se:3 ]",
    "we exhibit the bifurcation mechanism and count the number of physical degrees of freedom . in section [ se:4 ] ,",
    "we first transmute the free field into a geometric model with propagating torsion , relating it to an ( improved ) version of einstein  weyl gravity , as well as to its other , maxwell vector , avatar .",
    "we then exhibit the nonlinear obstructions and their effects , in particular , introduction of propagator - less variables . in section [ se:5 ]",
    "we comment on possible applications to other interacting gauge theories .",
    "in keeping with our hamiltonian approach , we use a first - order formulation of the action , @xmath5= \\int{\\operatorname{d}\\!}^3x \\left[\\frac12 { \\epsilon}^{\\mu\\nu\\rho}f^i{}_{\\mu}r_{i\\nu\\rho}+\\frac12 { \\epsilon}^{\\mu\\nu\\rho } { \\lambda}^i{}_{\\mu } t_{i\\nu\\rho}-\\frac{e}{4}\\left(f_{ik}f^{ik}-f^2\\right)\\right]\\ , .",

    "the lagrange - multiplier @xmath11 ensures the on - shell torsion constraint @xmath12 , while the auxiliary @xmath13 is essentially the same as @xmath14 in @xcite and in the appendix a of the second reference @xcite .",
    "the first - order action is just an ostrogradsky auxiliary variable form of the original fourth - order action , so the two are classically equivalent and share the same excitation content .",
    "we now proceed to analyze canonically , following the earlier methods of @xcite , to which we refer for a more extensive discussion . the lagrangian s variables ( @xmath15 have conjugate momenta @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 , leading to the primary constraints ( @xmath20 means weakly equal , i.e. , equal on the constraint surface ) :    @xmath21    the constraints @xmath22 are second class",
    ". it will be useful to define the linear combination @xmath23 eliminating the momenta @xmath24 leads to a partly reduced phase space , in which the nontrivial dirac brackets are given by @xmath25 the remaining dirac brackets are the same as the corresponding poisson brackets .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian @xmath26 can be written as a sum over secondary constraints @xmath27 up to boundary terms . here ,",
    "@xmath28    and @xmath29 the consistency conditions of the secondary constraints lead to the ternary constraints @xmath30 that establish the symmetry of the auxiliary fields .",
    "similarly , the consistency conditions of the ternary constraints yield quaternary constraints @xmath31 at this stage the constraint procedure fortunately ends : no further constraints are generated through consistency conditions .",
    "having found all constraints in the previous section , we establish their first / second class properties in order to count the number of physical dof .",
    "we summarize the main result in tables [ tab:1 ] and [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the fact that we have two different tables is a consequence of the advertised subtlety we called `` bifurcation '' and now explain .",
    "the consistency condition of the quaternary constraint @xmath32 leads to the following dirac bracket @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total hamiltonian @xmath35 and ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) are lagrange - multipliers of primary constraints .",
    "all components @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined at this stage ( and hence the corresponding constraints are second class ) , except for the lagrange multiplier @xmath42 that multiplies the primary constraint @xmath43 .",
    "the consistency conditions allows us to determine the remaining lagrange multiplier @xmath42 , unless the condition @xmath44 holds .",
    "the resulting bifurcation consists in the following : if condition does / not hold , the quaternary constraint @xmath32 and the primary constraint @xmath43 are both first / second class .",

    "i.e. , when is absent , we have a 48-dimensional phase space with 12 first class and 20 second class constraints .",
    "consequently , the theory in general exhibits two local physical dofs , namely the massive bulk gravitons .",
    "however , if the condition holds , then table [ tab:2 ] states that there are 14 first class constraints and 18 second class constraints . in that case",
    "the number of local physical dofs is reduced to one .",
    "translating condition into metric form , by using @xmath55 and @xmath56 , one finds that it holds automatically if the metric is a solution of the einstein equations @xmath57 this observation concurs with the fact that the linearized theory around einstein solutions has one additional gauge symmetry due to partial masslessness @xcite .",
    "again , this symmetry enhancement results from the fact that the constraint @xmath43 becomes first class , leading to the additional gauge symmetry .",
    "however , the latter is an artifact of linearization , being broken in the full nonlinear theory , as we have shown above .",
    "in this section we provide an alternative derivation of the loss of gauge - invariance beyond linearization in a straightforward perturbative approach .",
    "this sheds additional light on the bifurcation mechanism and exhibits it as a clash between diffeomorphism and conformal invariance .",
    "moreover , the perturbative analysis can be useful particularly for possible higher - rank / higher - spin generalizations , where a full canonical analysis is often less accessible than a perturbative one .",
    "we work with the second order , `` ostrogradski '' action [ equivalent to ] , using auxiliary , symmetric tensor density , variables @xmath58 : @xmath59=   \\frac{1}{4}\\int { \\operatorname{d}\\!}^3x\\ ; \\big\\{g_{\\mu\\nu}(g)\\ , f^{\\mu\\nu } - \\frac12 \\big[f_{\\mu\\nu}^2 -(\\textrm{tr}\\ , f)^2\\big]/ \\sqrt{-g}\\big\\ }    \\label{eq : saction2}\\ ] ] where we have omitted the contracting metrics .",
    "[ completing squares and integrating out @xmath60 recovers ( [ eq : action2 ] ) . ]",
    "we will study ( [ eq : saction2 ] ) , initially at linear , then full non - linear , metric levels .",
    "the linearization of ( [ eq : action2 ] ) is manifestly ( linear ) diffeo - invariant , while use of the bianchi identity easily confirms its conformal invariance , under @xmath61 with our convention @xmath62",
    ". both invariances also hold in ( [ eq : saction2 ] ) , of course , with @xmath60 transforming as a ( linear ) diffeo tensor and conformally like the schouten tensor : @xmath63 .",
    "now we count dof : varying @xmath64 yields @xmath65 , where @xmath3 is the usual linear einstein operator . in @xmath0",
    ", there are no einstein excitations ( riemann and ricci being equivalent ) , so @xmath66 is a pure gauge `` metric '' .",
    "varying @xmath60 , we learn that @xmath64 obeys the einstein equation with linear source , so the general solution is:@xmath67 inserting  legally  ( [ eq : sol4 ] ) into ( [ eq : saction2 ] ) , we note first that its @xmath68 term vanishes by the bianchi identities upon part integration , leaving the quadratic @xmath60-terms : these precisely combine into the promised reduced one - dof maxwell action ( second reference in @xcite ) : @xmath69 \\rightarrow \\ ; -\\frac14 \\int { \\operatorname{d}\\!}^3x\\ ; f_{\\mu\\nu}^2 , \\quad   f_{\\mu\\nu}:=(\\partial_{\\mu } a_{\\nu } - \\partial_{\\nu } a_{\\mu})\\ , ; \\label{eq : eq5}\\ ] ] it is invariant under @xmath70 . that @xmath71 is indeed our conformal transformation parameter @xmath72",
    "is then verified by ( [ eq : eq3],[eq : sol4 ] ) .",
    "the above set of field equations is consistent with both underlying invariances ; for example , upon taking the divergence of einstein equation in ( [ eq : sol4 ] ) , its left side vanishes by the bianchi identity , while the divergence / conservation of its ( symmetric ) right side matter source also does , being proportional to the latters s field , i.e. , maxwell s , equations . in this connection ,",
    "note that there is no `` spin - loss '' paradox in the above tensor - to - vector transmutation because all massless fields in @xmath0 are necessarily spinless @xcite , at least in flat space ; it would be useful to learn if this persists in ( a)ds .    the above , conformal - to - gauge transmutation",
    "should not be confused with a separate , surprising @xcite , @xmath0 conformal invariance enjoyed by maxwell , by virtue of its further transmutability into a scalar .",
    "we provide a concise derivation , emphasizing the nonlocal ( as usual with such transmutations ) price involved : the first order maxwell action is @xmath73 = - \\frac12 \\int { \\operatorname{d}\\!}^3x \\big[f^{\\mu\\nu } ( \\partial_{\\mu } a_{\\nu } - \\partial_{\\nu } a_{\\mu } ) - \\frac12 f_{\\mu\\nu}^2\\big]\\ , ,   \\label{eq : a}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath74 are independent variables .",

    "the above procedure is nonlocal in @xmath90 , inherited from @xmath91 in .",
    "but one can not improve directly at the vector level either .",
    "any such attempt is doomed from the start : it is easily verified that there is no identically conserved @xmath92  as required by dimension  that is even on - shell gauge - invariant , so one can not cancel the maxwell stress - tensor s trace , @xmath93 . nor is any other local choice available , since it must , just by dimensions , depend on @xmath94 rather than on the field strengths @xmath95 ; the scalar itself is the only gauge - invariant , dimensionally correct , but nonlocal , option .",
    "[ we have not attempted to find a direct descent from to the scalar action . ]    in canonical terms , the associated dof - reducing maxwell gauge constraint is the standard ( @xmath96 ) , leaving a @xmath97 photon with just one transverse dof , whose sign is fixed by that chosen for ( [ eq : action2 ] ) or ( [ eq : saction2 ] ) .",
    "more explicitly , the maxwell action s kinetic term is ( @xmath98 ) , in terms of the spatial transverse - longitudinal orthogonal vector decomposition @xmath99 , which commutes with time - derivatives .",
    "the longitudinal excitation is removed by the gauss constraint @xmath100 that enforces @xmath101 .",
    "instead , the cubic correction ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) contains terms quadratic in @xmath102 , thereby replacing this constraint by an irrelevant ( because it integrates out ) perfect square plus ( cubic ) terms that depend on @xmath103 , so the longitudinal dof are reinstated .",
    "( we have checked that cubic terms @xmath104 are absent though . )",
    "not having studied the hamiltonian in detail , we can not assert that it is no longer bounded below , but that seems likely for any cubic : one would have to include quartic corrections for a meaningful conclusion , though that is not very relevant any more . this paradoxical second order form of a fourth order action is explained by the original metric propagator indeed being @xcite @xmath105 , thus agreeing with @xmath60 having dimension of curvature , @xmath106 , hence @xmath107 . [ actually , our method also applies , with appropriate dimensional numerical differences , to the @xmath108 weyl action , which can also be written ( modulo coefficient differences in schouten ) in the form .",
    "the @xmath0 argument is unchanged , in particular that @xmath109 and @xmath79 each obey the einstein equation , so each has 2 , rather than @xmath0 s 0 , dof",
    ". the @xmath74 , coordinate vector gauge , part of @xmath60 still represents a ( now 2 dof ) photon @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "again , there is no spin - transmutation paradox ( despite the presence of spin @xmath108 ) , because the propagator of a fourth derivative order theory can ( and usually does ) include lower - spin poles . ]",
    "our linearized system has a second , more general geometrical interpretation : it represents a propagating vector torsion and contortion , but a non - propagating ( because @xmath0 ) metric .",
    "indeed , this is already suggested by the einstein equation in .",

    "\\label{eq : geomint}\\ ] ] the parameter choice @xmath114 kills the ricci tensor s antisymmetric part .",
    "the further choices @xmath115 and @xmath116 make the vanishing of the einstein tensor , but now of the full connection , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , coincide with the source - ful einstein equation of .",
    "the divergence of the right hand side of that equation is proportional to the maxwell operator , whose vanishing is then assured by consistency with the metric bianchi identity .",
    "note that this total connection @xmath119 is metric compatible in the einstein ",
    "weyl sense .",
    "@xmath120 in this interpretation the maxwell field is recognized as the weyl potential , up to a factor and the presence of torsion , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we stress that the inclusion of torsion leads to an improvement of the usual torsionless einstein ",
    "weyl connection , since our ricci tensor is symmetric , while the einstein ",
    "weyl ricci - tensor in general is not .",
    "more explicitly , for einstein  weyl we have @xmath121 and @xmath122 ; note that metric - compatibility in the einstein ",
    "weyl sense is guaranteed if @xmath123 .",
    "interestingly , the tracefree part of the right eq .   coincides precisely with the einstein ",
    "weyl equations ( up to terms quadratic in the weyl potential ) , see @xcite and refs .  therein .",
    "this provides yet - another - way to see why conformal invariance is broken cubically : the einstein ",
    "weyl equations are weyl - invariant , but they coincide with our equations only at the linearized level , not non - linearly .",
    "we now show explicitly how enforcing diffeo- destroys conformal- invariance beyond linear order , as it must since the full action ( [ eq : action2 ] ) involves the factor @xmath124 , rather than @xmath125 .",
    "we need only consider the first , cubic , deviation , where the effect will be manifested as loss of maxwell gauge invariance .",
    "returning to ( [ eq : saction2 ] ) and inserting the linearized values , we find that the cubic action reduces , schematically , to the `` bare @xmath74-form '' @xmath126 \\sim \\frac14\\int { \\operatorname{d}\\!}^3x\\,\\big[2 g_2^{\\mu\\nu}(h)\\partial_\\mu a_\\nu + h_{\\mu\\nu } q^{\\mu\\nu}(a)\\big ] \\ , ,      \\label{eq : eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 ( and also its integral ) is an ( irreducibly ) gauge _ variant _ quantity bi - linear in the gauge potential @xmath78 .. ] this manifest loss of maxwell gauge invariance means of course , loss of conformal invariance . a concrete , `` no - calculation '' realization of invariance loss is now easy .",
    "consider first the vacuum state in the gauge @xmath128 , @xmath129 : all linearized and cubic terms manifestly vanish .",
    "now gauge - vary this `` null '' configuration , with local parameter @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are the minkowski coordinates .",
    "then @xmath132 : this means @xmath74 is a conformal killing vector of the flat background .",
    "the ( gauge invariant ) quadratic action still vanishes of course . instead , @xmath133 . this",
    ", manifestly constant trace , @xmath134 , is easily found to be non - zero ; hence the cubic action is a non - invariant , proportional ( in this gauge ) to the vector `` mass '' term @xmath135 , already at vacuum .",
    "we conclude that the simple one - dof content of the linearized level is indeed lost here , with the implied consequent presence of additional , ghost , modes that always plagues generic quadratic actions , albeit without propagators of their own .",
    "we have studied a novel , higher - order , clash between two local invariances that characterize dynamical quadratic curvature schouten schouten - ghost - free @xmath0 gravity , at linear order . after performing a canonical analysis and exhibiting a bifurcation in the constraint analysis that leads to different counts of dofs , we considered the theory perturbatively , providing a transparent derivation of the free theory s one - dof , second order , character : our geometrical , torsionful , representation complementing an earlier vectorial transmutation .",
    "we then traced the unavoidable breaking , already at cubic level , of the model s conformal symmetry by its nonlinear diffeo - invariant , but conformal - gauge dependent , completion .",
    "the culprits were the dynamical ( rather than minkowski ) metrics that contract indices beyond lowest order .",
    "the above symmetry - breaking raises one , also novel , field - theoretic puzzle posed by this otherwise consistent model : its propagator depends on fewer variables than do its vertices . how does one calculate ( at least perturbatively ) either classically or at quantum loop level ?",
    "the new variables , having no lines of their own , can only lie on open , but presumably not on closed loop lines , yet they are not external fields either .",
    "we have also checked the consistency of our perturbative analysis with a non - perturbative canonical analysis along the lines of @xcite , with perfect agreement .",
    "a ( vaguely ) similar situation occurs in topologically massive gravity , whose metric s propagator is not uniformly of either second or third derivative order , since its third derivative cotton contribution is independent of the metric s conformal factor , one that is present in its einstein , second order term .",
    "that problem is not one of principle , however  all components have proper propagators , just ones of different momentum order  and can only affect topologically massive gravity s uv behavior @xcite . rather , the nearest analog is perhaps massive @xmath108 einstein gravity with a `` wrong '' explicit mass term a la @xcite ; however that symmetry - breaking pathology is inserted by hand , rather than , as in our model , from enforcing a greater invariance ! clearly , some intriguing unsolved directions remain .",
    "the general non - perturbative conditions of the canonical analysis we encountered here are a non - perturbative extension and here agree with the perturbative results .",
    "moreover , a similar effect was observed in generalized massive gravity , see second reference in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the bifurcation effect we described here is not just confined to our specific model , but can be present in more general interacting higher - rank / higher - spin gauge theories as well as , perhaps , in vector models , see @xcite and refs .  therein .",
    "we conclude with a list of ingredients necessary , but not always sufficient , for the emergence of bifurcation .    1 .",
    "higher ( at least spin 2 ) gauge symmetries 2 .",
    "non - linear ( at least cubic ) interactions 3 .",
    "the linearized theory must have additional ( linearized ) gauge symmetries such as conformal / weyl symmetry 4 .",
    "the linearized gauge symmetry must be broken in the interacting theory    it would be interesting to construct explicit examples of bifurcation in @xmath136 theories with spins higher than 2 , and/or towers thereof .",
