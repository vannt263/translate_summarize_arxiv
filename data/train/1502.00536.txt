    "determining an unknown signal from a set of measurements is a fundamental problem in science and engineering .",
    "however , as the number of free parameters defining the signal increases , its tomographic determination may become a daunting task .",
    "fortunately , in many contexts there is prior information about the signal that may be useful for tomography .",
    "compressed sensing  @xcite is a signal recovery technique developed for this aim .",
    "it utilizes specific types of prior information about the structure of the signal to substantially compress the amount of information needed to reconstruct it with high accuracy .",
    "in particular , it harnesses the prior information that the signal has a concise representation , e.g. , that it is a sparse vector with a few nonzero elements or a low - rank matrix with a few nonzero singular values .",
    "the compressed sensing protocol then defines special classes of measurements , henceforth referred to as `` compressed sensing measurements , '' that enable the unique identification of the signal from within the restricted set of sparse vectors or low - rank matrices using substantially fewer measurement settings .",
    "moreover , it provides algorithms for efficient reconstruction by defining a specific class of convex optimization heuristics whose solution determine the unknown signal from the measurement outcomes with very high accuracy ( see methods ) .",
    "importantly , solving any other optimization programs outside this class will not necessarily result in a compressed sensing protocol .",
    "in the context of quantum information science , the  signals \" we seek to reconstruct are , for example , quantum states and processes , and the protocol for reconstruction is quantum tomography . because the number of free parameters in quantum states and processes scale poorly ( growing as some power of the total hilbert space dimension , which in turn grows exponentially with the number of subsystems ) , there has been a concerted effort to develop techniques that minimize the resources necessary for tomography . to this end , the methodology of compressed sensing has been applied to the problem of quantum tomography  @xcite .    in the pioneering work of",
    "@xcite it was proved that quantum measurements can be easily designed to be within the special class of measurements required for compressed sensing .",
    "then , using the specifically chosen convex optimization , low - rank density matrices ( close to pure quantum states ) or low - rank process matrices ( close to unitary evolutions ) can be accurately reconstructed with a substantially reduced number of measurement settings .",
    "the work we report here identifies a critical link between quantum tomography and compressed sensing .",
    "we discuss in particular the case of quantum state tomography , where the aim is to recover the density matrix , a _ positive semidefinite _",
    "matrix , typically normalized with unit trace .",
    "we show that the positivity property alone imposes a powerful constraint that places strong restrictions on the physical states that are consistent with the data . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sets ] , this restriction is stronger than the one present in generic compressed sensing of signals which are not necessarily positive semidefinite matrices .",
    "this , in turn , has far reaching consequences .",
    "first and foremost , it implies that as long as quantum measurements are within the special class associated with compressed sensing , then any optimization heuristic that contains the positivity constraint is effectively a compressed sensing protocol .",
    "second , tools provided by the compressed sensing methodology now enable the construction of special types of informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and to small model imperfections , with rigorous bounds .",
    "finally , our results fundamentally unify many different quantum tomography protocols which were previously thought to be distinct , such as maximum - likelihood solvers , under the compressed sensing umbrella .",
    "we emphasize that constraining the normalization ( trace ) to a fixed value , as one does for density matrices , plays no role in the theorems we discuss below .",
    "thus our results extend beyond the context of quantum state tomography , applying , e.g. , to process tomography when the latter is described by a completely positive map , and more generally to the reconstruction of low - rank positive semidefinite matrices .",
    "* informational completeness *    in quantum theory , a measurement is represented by a positive operator - valued measure , povm , a set of positive semidefinite @xmath0 matrices that form a resolution of the identity , @xmath1 . the elements of a povm represent the possible outcomes ( events ) of the measurement , and probability of measuring an outcome @xmath2 is given by the usual born rule , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the state of the system , a positive semidefinite matrix , @xmath5 , normalized such that @xmath6 .",
    "in the context of quantum - state tomography , _ informationally complete _ measurements play a central role .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of all quantum states ( density matrices ) .",
    "a measurement is said to be informationally complete if  @xcite @xmath8 in other words , no two distinct states @xmath9 and @xmath10 yield the same measurement outcome probabilities .",
    "thus , a ( noise - free ) record of an informationally complete measurement uniquely determines the state of the system . in general , for a @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space , an informationally complete measurement consists of at least @xmath12 outcomes ( povm elements ) .",
    "while eq .   gives a general definition of an informationally complete measurement , if one has prior information about the state of the system , we can make this definition more specific  @xcite .",
    "in particular , suppose the state is known _ a priori _ to be of a special class , @xmath13 , e.g. , the class of density matrices of at most rank @xmath14 .",
    "one defines a measurement to be @xmath13 restricted informationally complete ( restricted - ic ) if it can only uniquely identify a quantum state from within the subset @xmath13 , but can not necessarily uniquely identify it from within the set of all quantum states .",
    "such @xmath13 restricted - ic measurements can be composed of fewer outcomes than the @xmath12 outcomes required for a general informationally complete measurement .",
    "for example , heinosaari  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that when @xmath13 is the set of density matrices of at most rank @xmath14 , then rank-@xmath14 restricted - ic measurements can be constructed with @xmath15 outcomes , rather than @xmath16 outcomes required for a general informationally complete measurement .",
    "one can formalize this definition in the context of quantum - state tomography .",
    "a measurement is said to be @xmath13 restricted - ic , if  @xcite @xmath17 in some situations , a measurement can satisfy a stricter definition of informational completeness than the @xmath13 restricted - ic of eq .  .",
    "a measurement is said to be @xmath13 strictly - ic , if  @xcite @xmath18 there is a subtle yet important difference in the definitions of @xmath13 restricted - ic and @xmath13 strictly - ic .",
    "while the measurement record of the former identifies a unique state within the set @xmath13 , the measurement record of a the latter identifies a unique state within the set of _ all _ quantum states .",
    "these notions of informationally completeness are key to understanding compressed sensing and its application in quantum tomography , as we discuss below .    *",
    "the relation between informational completeness and compressed sensing *    at its heart , the compressed sensing methodology employs prior information to reduce the number of measurements required to reconstruct an unknown signal . here",
    "we consider the compressed sensing recovery of a @xmath19 hermitian matrix , @xmath20 .",
    "let the measurement record be specified as a vector - valued linear map , @xmath21_i = { { \\rm tr}}(a_i m)$ ] , where @xmath22 is known as the  sensing map . \" in general ,",
    "when the set @xmath23 forms a basis for @xmath19 matrices with at least @xmath12 elements  @xcite , then the measurement record is informationally complete in the sense of eq .  , and in the absence of measurement noise , the signal can be recovered uniquely .    if , however , we know _ a priori _ that @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , then we can substantially reduce the number of measurement samples required to uniquely reconstruct the unknown signal - matrix",

    "then @xmath26 is the _",
    "unique _ hermitian matrix within the set of _ low - rank _ hermitian matrices ( up to rank @xmath14 ) that is consistent with the measurement record .",
    "+ importantly , in compressed sensing , when @xmath29 , there are generally an infinite number of hermitian matrices with rank larger than @xmath14 that are consistent with the measurement record",
    ". thus , the measurement record associated with compressed sensing can not uniquely specify @xmath26 among all @xmath19 hermitian matrices , and therefore it is not informationally complete in the sense of eq .  .",
    "if , however , the sensing map @xmath22 corresponds to compressed sensing measurements ( e.g. , it satisfies the restricted isometry property  @xcite , see methods ) , then according to the above theorem , the measurement record uniquely specifies @xmath26 within the restricted set of low - rank hermitian matrices ( rank@xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore compressed sensing measurements correspond to rank-@xmath14 restricted - ic , in the sense of eq .  .",
    "this relation between compressed sensing measurements and rank-@xmath14 restricted - ic implies that any successful search must be restricted to the low rank set of hermitian matrices . to achieve this ,",

    "the use of the nuclear norm is essential here .",
    "if one uses only the compressed number of samples , solving any other optimization that is not related to the above rank - minimization heuristic by some regularization will not result in a successful recovery .",

    "theorem  1 differs qualitatively from the standard compressed sensing theorem in a few key aspects .",
    "as discussed above , the general theory of compressed sensing guarantees that if the signal is a low - rank matrix with rank @xmath43 , and if the sensing map corresponds to compressed sensing measurements , then the measurement record uniquely specifies the unknown signal - matrix , but only within the subset of matrices with rank @xmath44 .",
    "theorem  1 , on the other hand , states that if the matrix to be estimated is constrained to be a positive matrix ( e.g. , a density matrix ) , then the measurement record uniquely specifies the matrix from within the entire set of positive hermitian matrices .",
    "therefore , without the positivity constraint , compressed sensing measurements correspond to rank-@xmath14 restricted - ic measurements of eq .  , whereas under positivity , the same measurements correspond to rank-@xmath14 strictly - ic measurements of eq .  .",

    "theorem  1 implies that the solution set contains only one matrix , the density matrix @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that we can use any optimization method to search for it , and we are guaranteed to find it .",
    "thus , we have the following result : given a quantum measurement record @xmath53 $ ] , such that @xmath50 , and where @xmath22 corresponds to compressed sensing measurements , then the solution to @xmath54=\\bm{p}\\ , \\ ,   { \\rm and } \\ , \\ ,   \\rho \\geq 0,\\ ] ] or to @xmath55-\\bm{p}\\vert\\;\\ ; { \\rm s.t.}\\ ; \\rho \\geq 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is a any convex function of @xmath4 , and @xmath57 is any norm function , is unique : @xmath58 . by confining the feasible set of matrices to positive matrices ,",
    "we ensure that the measurement record uniquely identifies @xmath46 from the set of all density matrices , and thus any convex function of @xmath4 or the measurement error may serve as a cost function .",
    "for example , this result applies to maximum-(log)likelihood estimation  @xcite where @xmath59 .",
    "we thus conclude that when the feasible set of density matrices is constrained to be physical ( i.e. , have positive eigenvalues ) , any quantum tomography protocol whose sensing map corresponds to compressed sensing measurements will exhibit the compressed sensing effect .",
    "we do not include a trace constraint in the convex programs above . in the noiseless case considered here",
    "it is redundant .",
    "because the data came from a trace - preserving quantum measurements , the unique solution must be a normalized quantum state . as discussed in the supplementary information",
    ", the constraints @xmath5 and @xmath6 , taken together , immediately imply that @xmath46 is the only density matrix consistent with the noiseless data .",
    "when we consider the important case of noisy measurements , the consequence trace constraint is nontrivial , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "+    * robustness to measurement noise and model imperfection *    so far , we have discussed the ideal case of a noiseless measurement record , where in the context of quantum tomography , @xmath60 denoted a probability vector .",
    "the compressed sensing methodology , however , assures a robust reconstruction of the signal in the presence of measurement noise .",
    "our analysis inherits this crucial feature . in a realistic scenario ,",
    "we allow for a noisy measurement record , @xmath61+\\bm{e}$ ] , where we assume that the noise contribution can be bounded by some norm @xmath62 . in the context of quantum tomography we consider @xmath63 to denote a vector of the observed frequencies of measurement outcomes .",
    "theorem  1 ensures robust recovery of the positive density matrix if the noise level is small by solving any convex optimization problem . under the assumptions of theorem  1 , any convex minimization problem that searches for",
    "a solution within the cone of positive matrices must yield a solution @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 as @xmath67 . from a geometrical point of view ,",
    "when the noisy data arises from a rank - deficient state , as we gain data , there are fewer states that could have given rise to that data because the convex set of physical states is highly constrained near the point . in the idealized limit of noiseless data , there is only one state compatible with the data .",
    "therefore , qualitatively , we expect a compressed sensing effect no matter how we search for the solution whenever the data arises from low rank positive matrices .",
    "quantitatively , of course , different heuristics may perform differently , yielding different estimates . choosing the best optimization depends , in part , on the specific noise model . for example , in supplementary information section  b we derive a specific bound on the frobenius ( hilbert - schmidt ) norm @xmath68 , where @xmath64 is the solution of a nonnegative least - squares program @xmath69-\\bm{f}\\vert_2\\;\\ ; { \\rm s.t.}\\ ; \\rho \\geq 0.\\ ] ] whereas the normalization constraint , @xmath70 was unecessary in the noiseless case , in the case of a noisy measurement record , the convex optimization is not guaranteed to obtain a normalized state .",
    "one can include the trace constraint in the optimization , but it is generally unnecessary in the noisy case as well .",
    "in fact , sometimes one can actually improve the robustness to noise by choosing @xmath71 , as we discuss below .",
    "in general , the output of the optimization should then be renormalized to give the final estimate .",

    "minimizing the trace of the matrix in the absence of the positivity constraint is not equivalent to minimizing the nuclear norm , and therefore , would not achieve compressed sensing . while both eq .   and eq .   are compressed sensing programs , in general they return different estimations .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which quantum - state tomography via continuous measurement was achieved at a equivalent rate by both least - squares and trace minimization , with the positivity constraint included .",
    "the difference between the final estimate was attributed to a difference in the robustness of the two estimators to noise . since eqs .   and   are formally equivalent , the noisy measurement can be equivalently accommodated by solving   with a choice of @xmath76 that depends on the noise bound @xmath77 .",
    "as always , we renormalize to obtain the final density matrix .",
    "in addition to noise in the measurements , there can be imperfections in the model .",
    "when the sensing map satisfies the restricted isometry property , the compressed sensing methodology is not restricted to exact rank - deficient signal matrices .",
    "it also ensures the robust recovery of the dominant rank-@xmath14 part of the density matrix .",
    "our analysis shares this important and nontrivial property .",
    "lemma  2 given in supplementary information section  b is the root of this feature .",
    "we have shown that theorem  1 implies that for a positive matrix recovery , compressed sensing measurements correspond to a stronger notion of informationally completeness  a rank-@xmath14 strictly - ic .",
    "this implies that for quantum tomography we can construct robust measurements that are also rank-@xmath14 strictly - ic . the robustness to measurement noise and model imperfection",
    "is guaranteed by the compressed sensing theory .",

    "in addition to the average values , we also obtain the frequency of occurrence of each outcome , @xmath83 , where @xmath2 indexes the series of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
