    "in recent years , the playground of nuclear physics has extended towards neutron and proton drip lines  @xcite .",
    "huge amount of new experimental data on nuclei far from the valley of stability has been provided by new rare - isotope facilities .",
    "the knowledge of these nuclei has largely improved also due to the progress in theoretical methods and computing power which allows to calculate light nuclei in _ ab initio _ framework taking into account the proximity of the scattering continuum .",
    "the description of various manifestations of the continuum coupling requires the generalization of existing many - body methods and call for theories which unify structure and reactions .",
    "realistic studies of the coupling to continuum in the many - body framework can be made in the open quantum system extension of the shell model ( sm ) , the so - called continuum shell model ( csm )  @xcite .",
    "a recent realization of the csm is the complex - energy csm based on the berggren ensemble  @xcite , the gsm , which finds a mathematical setting in the rigged hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "this model is a natural generalization of the standard sm for the description of configuration mixing in weakly bound states and resonances .",
    "berggren completeness relation can be derived from the newton completeness relation  @xcite for the set of real - energy eigenstates by deforming the real momentum axis to include resonant poles which are located in the fourth quadrant of the complex @xmath5-plane .",
    "thus the berggren completeness relation which replaces the real - energy scattering states by the resonance contribution and a background of complex - energy continuum states , puts the resonance part of the spectrum on the same footing as the bound and scattering spectrum . as the benefit of the explicit inclusion of the non - resonant continuum and resonant poles ,",
    "the contribution of the unbound states to the one- and two - body matrix elements can be discussed .",
    "berggren ensemble has found the application in the gsm  @xcite , time - dependent green s function approach  @xcite , the no - core gsm  @xcite , the coupled cluster approach  @xcite , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach  @xcite , and in the coupled - channel gsm  @xcite to study various nuclear structure and reaction problems .",
    "another approach is the complex scaling ( cs ) method  @xcite , which has been used to solve many - body resonances in many fields including atomic physics , molecular physics  @xcite and nuclear physics  @xcite . in the cs method ,",
    "asymptotically - divergent resonant states are described within @xmath6-integrable functions through the rotation of space coordinates and their conjugate momenta in the complex plane . as basis functions , the gaussian expansion method ( gem )",
    "@xcite has been extensively employed for the cluster - orbital shell model ( cosm )  @xcite and coupled rearrangement channel model such as the tv - model  @xcite .",
    "the cs - cosm has successfully been applied to description of resonant states observed above the many - body decay threshold in @xmath3-shell nuclei ( @xmath7-@xmath8 ) using a @xmath9he+@xmath10 model , where @xmath11-@xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the cs - tv model for the core+2n systems has been shown to reproduce the observed coulomb breakup cross sections for three - body continuum energy states  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of these studies is to perform a detailed comparison of the gsm and the gem+cs results for @xmath15he and @xmath15be using the same cosm coordinates for valence nucleons  @xcite and the same hamiltonian . in cosm ,",
    "all coordinates are taken with respect to the core center - of - mass ( com ) , so that the translational invariance is strictly preserved .",
    "cosm combined with cs method has been employed in numerous studies of weakly bound states and resonances in light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "cosm coordinates have been also used in gsm  @xcite to investigate isospin mixing in mirror nuclei  @xcite and charge radii in halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our cosm hamiltonian and the model space . in section iii , the two theoretical approaches , namely the gem+cs ( section iii.a ) and the gsm ( section iii.b ) , are briefly introduced . gem+cs and gsm results for @xmath15he and @xmath15be",
    "are presented and discussed in section iv . finally , section v gives the main conclusions of these studies .",
    "in these studies , we employ the three - body model for @xmath4he plus two - nucleon system in the cosm coordinates  @xcite ( see fig .  [",

    "contrary to the @xmath38 state , one may notice a slight difference between trajectories of @xmath39-poles in gem+cs approach and in gsm .",
    "this difference diminishes with increasing @xmath40 .      in the comparison between the gem+cs and gsm approaches ,",
    "we obtain a good agreement for the bound state @xmath38 in @xmath2he , and narrow resonances ; @xmath39 in @xmath2he and @xmath38 in @xmath2be .",
    "a small difference appears only for the @xmath39 broad resonance in @xmath2be .",
    "below , we shall discuss a possible origin of such a small difference in the numerical results .",
    "both gem+cs and gsm approaches solve the non - hermitian problem . in the gem+cs approach ,",
    "the wave function of a resonance becomes @xmath6-integrable with the help of the complex rotation . as a result ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes non - hermitian .",
    "the standard procedure to find the optimum values of the parameters is to search for a stationary point of the eigenvalue with respect to the variational parameters .",
    "the variational parameters are the complex rotation angle @xmath41 and the parameter @xmath42 in a definition of the gaussian width ; @xmath43  @xcite for the gaussian basis functions . the optimization procedure is a simplified version of the generalized variational principle for complex eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "the procedure works efficiently and gives very accurate solutions even for broad resonant states  @xcite .",

    "gsm is formulated in the berggren set , which includes bound single - particle states , single - particle resonances and scattering states from the discretized contour for each considered @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , the hamiltonian matrix in this basis becomes complex - symmetric .",
    "the number of scattering states on each discretized contour @xmath49 and the momentum cutoff have to be chosen to assure the completeness of many - body calculations .",

    ", the difference is only @xmath53 kev , and both methods give almost the equivalent result .    on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath39 state of @xmath2be is a broad resonant pole due to the presence of the coulomb force for all three particles .",
    "the optimum value of the rotation angle in gem+cs calculation is @xmath54 , and the optimal ho oscillator length in gsm calculations is @xmath55 fm .",
    "the difference of complex gem+cs and gsm eigenenergies becomes in the order of 10 kev . to improve the agreement for the eigenvalues obtained by gem+cs and gsm",
    ", it would be necessary to examine the optimization of the variational parameters more precisely .",
    "however , in the practical point of view , the difference is only less than 1 percent to the total energy .",
    "the convergence can be tested by introducing an extrapolation procedure , e.g. the richardson extrapolation  @xcite .",
    "we extrapolate the energy @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",

    "hence , we can conclude that both methods provide a sufficient accuracy even for the calculation of the broad resonant states .",
    "gsm and gem+cs are two different theoretical approaches which allow to describe unbound resonant states .",
    "these two approaches differ in the choice of the basis functions and the numerical procedure to obtain the eigenvalues .",
    "to benchmark gsm and gem+cs approaches , we have performed a precise comparison for weakly bound and unbound states using the same hamiltonian in the cosm coordinates preserving the translational invariance . for a weakly bound ground - state of @xmath2he , gsm and gem+cs",
    "give essentially identical results .",
    "for the three - body resonance states , gem+cs and gsm give very close results proving the reliability of both schemes of the calculation for unbound states .",
    "the slight difference between gsm and gem+cs results for broad resonances may have different origins .",
    "the ho expansion procedure in calculating the tbmes in gsm may lead to rounding errors , especially for broad many - body resonances . on the other hand",
    ", the stationarity condition in gem+cs approach could also be a source of small imprecision for broad resonances . based on our results",
