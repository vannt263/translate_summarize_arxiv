    "consider a sequence @xmath5 of i.i.d .  random variables with support on @xmath3 $ ] and having distribution function @xmath6 .",
    "for any fixed @xmath7 , the distributions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been well studied ; in fact it is shown in elementary texts that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "but what if we have a situation where the number @xmath0 of @xmath12 s is random , and we are instead considering the extrema @xmath13 and @xmath14 of a random number of i.i.d .",

    "variables , defined as @xmath16 satisfies , according to wald s lemma @xcite , the equation @xmath17 provided that @xmath0 is independent of the sequence @xmath18 and assuming that the means of @xmath2 and @xmath0 exist . the purpose of this paper is to show that the distributions in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be studied in many canonical cases , even if @xmath0 and @xmath19 are correlated . the main deviation from the papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where similar questions are studied , is that the variable @xmath2 is concentrated on the interval @xmath3 $ ]  unlike the above references , where @xmath2 has lifetime - like distributions on @xmath20 . even then , we find that many new and interesting distributions arise , none of them to be found , e.g. , in @xcite or @xcite . in another deviation from the theory of extremes of random sequences ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we find that the tail behavior of the extreme distributions is not relevant due to the fact that the distributions have compact support .",
    "we next cite three examples where our methods might be useful .",
    "first , we might be interested in the strongest earthquake in a given region in a given year .",
    "the number of earthquakes in a year , @xmath0 , is usually modeled using a poisson distribution , and , ignoring aftershocks and similarly correlated events , the intensities of the earthquakes can be considered to be i.i.d .",
    "random variables in @xmath21 $ ] whose distribution can be modeled using , e.g. , the data set maintained by caltech at @xcite .",
    "second , many  small world \" phenomena have recently been modeled by power law distributions , also sometimes termed discrete pareto or zipf distributions .",
    "see , for example , the body of work by chung and her co - authors @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein , where vertex degrees @xmath22 in  internet - like graphs \" @xmath23 ( e.g. , the vertices of @xmath23 are individual webpages , and there is an edge between @xmath24 and @xmath25 if one of the webpages has a link to the other ) are shown to be modeled by @xmath26^{-1}}{n^k}\\ ] ] for some constant @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the riemann zeta function @xmath29 thus if the vertices @xmath30 in a large internet graph have some bounded i.i.d .",
    "property @xmath12 , then the maximum and minimum values of @xmath12 for the neighbors of a randomly chosen vertex can be modeled using the methods of this paper .",
    "third , we note that @xmath0 and the @xmath12 may be correlated , as in the csug example ( studied systematically in section 3 ) where @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 follows the geometric distribution @xmath33 .",
    "this is an example of a situation where we might be modeling the maximum load that a device might have carried before it breaks down due to an excessive weight or current .",
    "it is also feasible in this case that the parameter @xmath4 might be unknown .",
    "here is our general set - up : suppose @xmath34 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables following a continuous distribution on @xmath3 $ ] with probability density and distribution functions given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is a random variable following a discrete distribution on @xmath37 with probability mass function given by @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be given by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we study the case of @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 .",
    "we call this the standard uniform geometric model .",
    "the csug ( correlated standard uniform model ) is studied in section 3 .",

    "the m.g.f.s of @xmath67 are easy to calculate too .",
    "notice that the logarithmic terms above arise due to the contributions of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 terms , and it is precisely these logarithmic terms that make , e.g. , method of moments estimates for @xmath4 to be intractable in a closed ( i.e. , non - numerical ) form .",
    "similar difficulties arise when analyzing the likelihood function and likelihood ratios .",
    "the correlated standard uniform geometric ( csug ) model is related to the sug model , as the name suggests , but @xmath2 and @xmath0 are correlated as indicated in section 1 .",
    "the csug problems arise in two cases .",
    "one case is that we conduct standard uniform trials until a variable @xmath12 exceeds @xmath70 , where @xmath4 is the parameter of the correlated geometric variable , and the maximum of @xmath71 is what we seek .",
    "the maximum is between 0 and @xmath70 .",
    "the other case is where standard uniform trials are conducted until @xmath12 is less than @xmath4 , and we are looking for the minimum of @xmath71 . the minimum is between @xmath4 and 1 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath72 be a sequence of standard uniform variables and define @xmath73 or @xmath74 in either case @xmath0 has probability mass function given by @xmath75 note that this is simply a geometric random variable conditional on the success having occurred at trial 2 or later .",
    "clearly @xmath0 is dependent on the @xmath2 sequence .    under the csug model , the p.d.f .  of @xmath39 ,",

    "the random variable @xmath39 has mean and variance given , respectively , by @xmath87and @xmath88    using proposition 3.3 , we can directly compute the mean and variance by setting @xmath89 .",
    "notice that the variance of @xmath39 is smaller than that of @xmath39 under the sug model , with an identical numerator term . also , the expected value is smaller under the csug model than in the sug case .    if the random variable @xmath40 has the  csug minimum distribution \" and @xmath53 , then @xmath90    routine , as before .",
    "the random variable @xmath40 has mean and variance given , respectively , by @xmath91and@xmath92    a special case of proposition 3.5 ; note that as in the sug model , @xmath93 .",
    "the intermingling of polynomial and logarithmic terms makes method of moments estimation difficult in closed form , as in the sug case .",
    "however , if @xmath4 is unknown , the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath4 can be found in a satisfying form , both in the cgug maximum and csug minimum cases .",
    "suppose that @xmath94 form a random sample from the csug maximum distribution with unknown @xmath4 .",
    "since the pdf of each observation has the following form : @xmath95 the likelihood function is given by @xmath96 the mle of @xmath4 is a value of @xmath4 , where @xmath97 , which maximizes @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath100 , it follows that @xmath101 is a increasing function , which means the mle is the largest possible value of @xmath4 such that @xmath102 .",
