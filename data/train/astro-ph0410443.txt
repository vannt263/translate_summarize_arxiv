    "it is believed that a new particle and/or gravitational physics is required to explain the acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the observations suggest that the bulk of energy density in the universe is gravitationally repulsive and appears like an unknown form of energy ( dark energy ) with negative pressure .",
    "it is believed that 2/3 of the total density of the universe is in a form of dark energy .",
    "there exist many different models of dark energy .",
    "it is convenient to describe them by using the equation of state parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a pressure and @xmath3 is the energy density .",
    "the analysis of the current observation data shows that @xmath4 lies in the range @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "* @xmath9 : phantom models .",
    "the most challenging for theoretical physics would be the case @xmath9 @xcite-@xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in this case",
    "the weak energy condition ( @xmath10 ) is violated and some strange phenomena as negative entropy and temperature appear . in many models",
    "the phantom universe in finite time ends up in the singularity called the big rip @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider string field theories nonlocal tachyon where the condition @xmath9 is realized .",
    "we show that due to a peculiar properties of nonlocal tachyon dynamics we can get a phantom universe without problems with unstability . a nonlocal dynamics for the tachyon field",
    "is obtained by truncation of the covariant string field equations .",
    "we study a nonlocal dynamics of a string tachyon in the cosmological friedmann metric .",
    "the string theory that we have in mind is the nsr string theory compactified on a six dimensional compact manifold .",
    "moreover we assume that all moduli are frozen and unstable non - bps brane extends along the three large spatial dimensions .",
    "the tension of the 3-dimensional non - bps brane acts as the 4-dimensional universe cosmological constant and the tachyon dynamics describes a deviation from a pure cosmological constant regime .",
    "a presence of tachyons was considered as a main drawback of corresponding strings theory .",
    "bosonic string has a tachyon and its absence in superstrings was a main motivation to introduce superstrings .",
    "however few years ego tachyon has found an application in the context of brane scenarios . the open bosonic string and gso @xmath11 nsr string tachyons",
    "were used to describe d - brane decays . according to the sen conjecture in the perturbative vacuum",
    "there are instable branes filling space - time and all these branes disappear in the true vacuum ( for review see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "rolling tachyon solutions describe transitions from perturbative vacuum to non - perturbative one .    here",
    "we use the covariant open string field theory(sft ) approach @xcite to tachyon dynamics ( about the effective dbi approach to tachyon dynamics see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "a crucial feature of the rolling tachyon solution for non - bps brane @xcite is that it interpolates between two non - perturbative vacua with the same energy .",
    "we argue that at large time the dynamics is governed by an effective action that contains a ghost kinetic term , in spite of absence of ghosts in the nonlocal action .",
    "we emphasize that the ghost here is a result of an approximation to the exact nonlocal action .",
    "there is no ghost in the nonlocal action .",
    "so we get a phantom universe as an approximation to the true nonlocal dynamics .",
    "this is the reason why there are no pathologies in this scenario with the thermodynamical instabilities .",
    "the rolling tachyon solution passes the perturbative vacuum with non - zero velocity .",
    "therefore , to reach the true vacuum starting from the perturbative one we have to supply the tachyon with a large enough initial velocity .",
    "this is a rather non - standard situation from the local field theory point of view , where one does not have to push strongly the tachyon to make it reach the true vacuum , it is need just an infinitesimal small perturbation .",
    "this effect occurs due to the presence of derivative terms in the interaction .",
    "these terms may be studied in an effective action approximation , which corresponds to keeping only few terms of an expansion of an nonlocal operator .",
    "we note that to reach the nonperturbative vacuum one has to add to the action a brane tension which is larger that is required by the sen hypothesis .",
    "this large brane tension can be interpreted as an effect of the closed string excitations .",
    "we find that in the effective field theory approximation the equation of state parameter @xmath0 , i.e. one has a phantom universe . in the dbi approach the equation of state parameter interpolates between -1 at early time and 0 at a later time . within application of the dbi action to cosmology",
