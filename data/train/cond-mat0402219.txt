    "in the last decade the magnetotransport of the 2deg , subjected to periodic potential modulations , has attracted considerable experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite attention . for one - dimensional ( 1d ) modulations novel oscillations of the magnetoresistivity tensor @xmath2 have been observed , at low magnetic fields @xmath0 , distinctly different in period and temperature dependence from the usual shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) ones observed at higher @xmath0 .",
    "these novel oscillations reflect the commensurability between two length scales : the cyclotron diameter at the fermi level @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the electron density , @xmath10 the magnetic length , and @xmath11 the period of the potential modulation .",
    "the situation is similar but less clearcut for 2d modulations from both a theoretical @xcite-@xcite and an experimental @xcite point of view . to date",
    "most of the experimental results pertinent to 2d modulations @xcite-@xcite with square or hexagonal symmetry have indicated strongly that the predicted @xcite fine structure of the landau levels is not resolved .",
    "magnetotransport theories pertinent to this case are rather limited @xcite,@xcite in contrast with those for 1d modulations .",
    "recent observations @xcite call for additional theoretical work since they could not be fully explained by earlier semiclassical theories @xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop , along the lines of ref .",
    "3 , the relevant quantum mechanical magnetotransport theory of the 2deg for precisely the case that the fine structure of the landau levels is not resolved . our goal is to explain recent experimental results @xcite on 2d , short - period ( @xmath12 ) surface superlattices with mobility @xmath13 in the intermediate range , i.e. , @xmath14 m@xmath15/vs .",
    "the symmetry of the 2d modulation is taken to be rectangular or hexagonal . a brief semiclassical account , pertinent to the former symmetry ,",
    "was reported in ref . 4 b ) .",
    "new magnetoresistance oscillations are found to occur _ when one flux quantum @xmath1 passes through an integral number of unit cells _ as was recently observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "here we show that these oscillations result from the interplay between band conduction and collisional conduction . a new contribution to",
    "the latter opens up as hopping between cyclotron orbits which are separated by an integral multiple of the modulation period and have the same position relative to the modulation lattice .",
    "this contribution is appreciable only in short - period superlattices and accordingly could not be resolved in early experiments on long - period superlattices . in the next section",
    "we derive the one - electron eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for rectangular and hexagonal modulations ; we also present the density of states .",
