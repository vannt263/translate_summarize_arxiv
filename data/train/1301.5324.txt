    "field theoretical and numerical investigations have indicated that the addition of frustration can lead to many exotic quantum ground states not realized in the standard two - leg ladder,@xcite yet comprehensive experimental investigations are still lacking .",
    "such a frustrated two - leg ladder seems to be realized in a newly discovered quasi - two - dimensional spin-1/2 compound @xmath0.@xcite the crystal structure of @xmath0is shown in fig.[fig : structure ] .",
    "zig - zag chains of @xmath10ions run parallel to the crystallographic b - axis , as shown clearly by a projection in the @xmath11 plane in fig.[fig : structure ] ( c ) . along the chains @xmath10ions at crystallographically inequivalent sites , labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",

    "such interactions are often a negligible perturbation to the isotropic heisenberg interaction , as in cuprate superconductors@xcite , but can sometimes alter the magnetic properties in a fundamental way . as an example , for compounds that lack local inversion symmetries anisotropic dzyaloshinksky - moriya ( dm)@xcite interactions are permitted in the magnetic hamiltonian . depending on the particular crystallographic symmetries",
    "the dm interaction can induce a staggered field.@xcite in 1d chains this staggered field results in an effective confinement potential between spinons and the appearance of incommensurate gapped modes on application of a magnetic field.@xcite the staggered field also has a drastic effect for spin ladders .",
    "in contrast to a spin ladder in a uniform magnetic field , which transitions to a gapless phase above a critical field , the presence of a staggered field is predicted to lead to a quantum phase transition between two gapped phases above and below the critical field.@xcite    the numerous exchange pathways in @xmath0complicate interpretation of thermodynamic data and important details including interladder coupling and anisotropic interactions are often neglected in the analysis . in order to determine the microscopic spin hamiltonian of a complex magnetic system with competing interactions and anisotropic exchange couplings , ins measurements using a single crystal sample are essential .",

    "in contrast to the single triply degenerate excitation branch expected for an isotropic ladder , we observe two branches of steeply dispersing , long - lived , excitations .",
    "the excitation gap of each mode , directly probed by ins , was measured to be @xmath1  mev and @xmath2  mev , this differs significantly from the @xmath19  mev gap extracted from thermodynamic measurements @xcite indicating that current models are inadequate to describe the ground state of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modes are consistent with a description in terms of thermal activation into singly and doubly degenerate modes .",
    "we argue that , in addition to frustration , strong anisotropic interactions are important for understanding the physics of this material .",
    "experiments were carried out on a 4.5  g single crystal sample grown using the traveling floating zone method .",

    "intensity modulation along the @xmath60 and @xmath61 directions is well described including only bonds @xmath14 and @xmath15 the results of the fit are shown as solid lines in fig.[fig : sqw_maps ] ( e ) - ( f ) .",
    "the intensity modulation is thus consistent with a two - leg ladder formed by antiferromagnetic rung coupling @xmath15 and weaker interladder coupling @xmath14 .",
    "our neutron scattering results confirm that the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath15 two - leg ladder with interladder exchange @xmath14 is an appropriate description of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the gap energy differs significantly from the value of @xmath68 2.9  mev reported by previous thermodynamic measurements .",
    "@xcite this discrepancy is potentially resolved by the presence of strong anisotropic interactions neglected in the thermodynamic analysis .",
    "indeed , dm anisotropies are permitted by the crystallographic symmetries of @xmath0 .",
    "these anisotropies can act to split the degeneracy of the lowest lying excitations in zero field , so that the thermodynamic properties are controlled by two gaps .",
    "it is notable , if perhaps coincidental , that the 2.9  mev thermodynamic gap is in agreement with the average of the two gaps measured by ins , @xmath69  mev .",
    "we have also checked that the low - temperature magnetic specific heat can be fit using an effective 1d model including the sum of contributions from both the low and high energy modes @xmath70 with each gap fixed at the value determined from ins .",
    "furthermore , a zero - field splitting of the lowest lying excitation resulting from a staggered dm interaction is consistent with the temperature dependence data presented next .",
    "the temperature dependence of spin excitations at @xmath71 near the incommensurate wavevector is shown in fig.[fig : t_dep](a ) .",
    "as the temperature is increased the inelastic features broaden and shift to higher energies . above 25",
    "k the two excitations can no longer be distinctly identified and above 55  k the inelastic signal can not be distinguished from background .",
    "each spectrum was fit to the resolution convolved single mode cross section [ eq . ] with a normalized lorentzian function in place of the delta function to account for intrinsic broadening of each mode . lacking detailed measurements of the dispersion for @xmath72  k",
    "the spin wave velocity was assumed to be independent of temperature for all fits . constant-*q",
    "* scans were performed at a wavevector where the orientation of the resolution ellipsoid with respect to the slope of the dispersion minimizes any resolution effects .",
    "we have also checked that allowing for a temperature dependent spin wave velocity does not affect the results presented here .",
    "figures [ fig : t_dep ] ( b ) - [ fig : t_dep](c ) show the temperature dependence of the gap energy , half - width half - maximum and integrated intensity of each mode .    in accordance with the thermalization of the ground and excited states , the integrated intensity decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for weakly interacting dimers predicts the scattering intensity to scale with the ground - state excited - state population difference @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the degeneracy of the level .",
    "@xcite the rpa form is a good description of the data after fitting only an overall scale factor [ solid lines in fig.[fig : t_dep ] ( b ) ] .",
    "the best fit is obtained assuming the two modes are composed of a lower energy doubly degenerate excitation ( @xmath75 ) and a higher energy singly degenerate excitation ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "although we do not have sufficiently detailed data to completely rule out the possibility of two triply degenerate modes .",
    "the scaling of the intensities provides good qualitative evidence for the splitting of a single triply degenerate excitation band into a doublet and singly degenerate excitation .    for systems with a gapped excitation spectrum increasing temperature results in an increased density of thermally activated states and concomitantly a decrease in the mean free path between scattering of the excited states , or equivalently a decreased excitation lifetime.@xcite thus",
    ", we expect a thermally induced broadening of the excitation spectrum , as visible in fig.[fig : t_dep ] ( c ) .",
    "below 30 k the damping is consistent with an exponential activated behaviour @xmath77 , valid for gapped one - dimensional systems.@xcite the fitted scale factors were @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the low and high energy modes respectively and the fits are shown as solid and dashed lines in fig.[fig : t_dep](c ) . a slight increase in excitation energy with increasing temperature was also observed [ fig.[fig : t_dep ] ( d ) ] .",
    "this is understood in the context of the thermally induced ",
    "blue - shift  that has been reported in other quasi - one - dimensional systems . @xcite .",
    "the excitation spectrum in @xmath0is unique in that competing interactions along the spin chains drive the dynamic correlations to an incommensurate wave - vector .",
    "incommensurate dynamic correlations have been observed in the four - leg antiferromagnetic spin tube @xmath80 @xcite ; however , the degree of incommensurability was much smaller than that observed in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the excitations in @xmath80 are comprised of a single , triply degenerate mode , while in @xmath0the degeneracy is split and the minimum of each mode occurs at a different wave vector .    in a canonical two - leg ladder the low energy magnetic excitation spectrum",
    "is composed of a well defined branch of dispersing triplets .",
    "application of an external magnetic field splits the degeneracy and three branches of excitations may be observed.@xcite the degeneracy may also be split in the presence of anisotropic interactions , such as the dm anisotropy , in the microscopic hamiltonian.@xcite we believe that the observed mode splitting in @xmath0may be accounted for by significant staggered dm interactions . in @xmath0local inversion symmetry",
    "is broken allowing a dm interaction , with the particular crystallographic symmetries admitting a dm anisotropy with a staggered dm vector on each rung as well as dm interactions on the chain bonds.@xcite although there are many possible dm vectors , our ins measurements can only resolve two - bands of excitations in zero - field indicating that the magnetic hamiltonian retains a local symmetry , so that we expect a single , dominant , anisotropy term .",
    "indeed dm interactions account for many features of the thermodynamic measurements including the weak linear field dependence of the low field magnetization below h@xmath81 @xcite , highly anisotropic critical fields @xcite , and absence of square root singularity in magnetization just above h@xmath81 .",
    "@xcite field theoretical modeling has shown that staggered anisotropic interactions in a spin-1/2 two - leg ladder can act to split the lowest lying triplet into a doublet with energy @xmath82 and higher energy mode with @xmath83.@xcite our temperature dependent measurements are consistent with this scenario , although further detailed magnetic field dependent measurements are required to definitively establish the degeneracy of each mode .",
    "in summary , we have measured the spin excitation spectrum in @xmath0at 6  k. the results confirm that @xmath0is in a quantum disordered phase and that the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath15 two - leg ladder model with interladder exchange @xmath14 appropriately accounts for the dominant exchange pathways .",
    "the measured incommensurate wavevector @xmath84 allows for an estimate of the relative strength of the competing magnetic interactions @xmath85 .",
    "however , the lowest excitation gap is 1.90(9 ) , is significantly lower than the value of 2.9 predicted by thermodynamic measurements .",
    "the discrepancy may be explained by the presence of strong anisotropic magnetic interactions which split the excitation spectrum into two coherent branches .",
    "we hope that our data will stimulate further theoretical work investigating the effect of dzyloshinsky - moria interactions and frustration on the spin - liquid ground state of a even - leg ladder .",
