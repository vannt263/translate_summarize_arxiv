    "two classes of young isolated neutron stars , the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are currently believed to host magnetars , i.e. isolated neutron stars endowed with ultra - strong magnetic fields , @xmath10@xmath11 g on the surface and one ( or more ) order of magnitude higher in the interior @xcite .",
    "sgrs and axps share a number of properties , including rotation periods in the 212 s range , large period derivatives ( @xmath12@xmath13 s s@xmath14 ) , inferred surface magnetic dipole field strength @xmath15 g , large and variable x - ray luminosities ( exceeding that available from the braking of their rotation ) , and the emission of short bursts ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "+ the five known local group sgrs were discovered as sources of short ( @xmath161 s ) and intense ( @xmath17@xmath18 ) bursts of gamma rays that they emit during sporadic periods of activity interrupted by long stretches of quiescence . once localized through their bursts and flares ,",
    "all of them were found to be persistent x - ray emitters , with luminosities of about @xmath19@xmath20 . in four sgrs ,",
    "being the exception , pulsations were detected with periods from 5 to 8 s and period derivatives of @xmath21@xmath13 s s@xmath14 .",
    "+  was discovered in 1998 june by the _",
    "compton gamma ray observatory _ thanks to the intense bursts it emitted at that time , about 100 in six weeks @xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery of the bursts , its persistent x - ray emission was detected by  at a flux level of @xmath5 @xmath22  ( unabsorbed , 210 kev ) , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath5 @xmath23  for a source distance @xmath24 kpc @xcite .",
    "this led to the possible association of the sgr with the young supernova remnant ( snr ) g337.00.1 in the ctb33 complex @xcite . in the following 10 years",
    "no further bursting activity was reported while the persistent emission steadily decayed to about @xmath19  ( for @xmath24 kpc ; @xcite ) , the lowest value ever observed from an sgr . at the same time the spectrum softened @xcite .",
    "+ the long - term fading of  was suddenly interrupted by its burst reactivation in 2008 may .",
    "this episode was associated with a temporary enhancement of the persistent x - ray flux and a marked spectral hardening @xcite .",
    "+ the detection of sgr - like bursts from  made it a bona fide member of the sgr class .",
    "however , two strong pieces of evidence in favor of this identification , the measure of the source period and period derivative , were still missing . in order to search for pulsations taking advantage of the enhanced flux after the reactivation , we requested a target of opportunity  observation , that was performed as soon as the satellite visibility constraints allowed it .",
    "our deep  observation of   started on 2008 september 25 at 00:51:02 ut and lasted about 120 ks , occupying the whole satellite revolution number 1611 .",
    "the data were collected with the epic instrument , which consists of two mos @xcite and one pn @xcite ccd cameras sensitive to photons with energies between 0.1 and 15 kev .",
    "the epic pn was operated in full frame mode ( time resolution 73 ms ) while both mos units were in small window mode ( time resolution 0.3 s ) .",
    "all the detectors mounted the thick optical blocking filter .",
    "+ the raw observation data files ( odf ) were processed with the  science analysis software ( sas version 8.0.0 ) and the calibration files released in 2007 august using standard pipeline tasks ( epproc and emproc for the pn and mos , respectively ) .",
    "the source photons for the timing and spectral analysis were accumulated from a circular region ( @xmath25 arcsec radius ) centered on .",
    "the background events were extracted from source - free regions of the same chip as the source .",
    "we selected events with pattern 04 and pattern 012 for the pn and the mos , respectively . for the timing analysis",
    ", the photon arrival times were converted to the solar system barycenter using the sas task barycen .",
    "photons having energies below 2 kev and above 12 kev were ignored , owing to the very few counts from . a total of about @xmath26 counts above the background were collected from  by the pn detector in the 212 kev range , @xmath27 by the mos1 detector , and @xmath28 by the mos2 detector .",
    "for the timing analysis we started with the high time - resolution pn data .",
    "we searched for pulsations in the 0.1515 s range using the @xmath29 test @xcite , with the number of harmonics @xmath30 being varied from 1 to 5 .",
    "the most significant peak occurred at about 2.6 s for @xmath31 ( see figure [ zsquare ] ) .",
    "taking into account the number of searched harmonics and periods ( 1,647,257 ) , the @xmath32 value of 80.72 for this peak corresponds to a chance probability of @xmath5 @xmath33 ( that is a @xmath346@xmath1 detection ) .",
    "+ we refined the period measurement by folding the pn plus mos data at the best period inferred through the @xmath32 test and studying the phase evolution by means of a phase - fitting technique ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit period was @xmath0 s ( epoch 54734.0 mjd ; hereafter all uncertainties are at 1@xmath1 confidence level , unless otherwise specified ) .",
    "the current data set a 3@xmath1 upper limit on the period derivative of @xmath35 s s@xmath14 .",
    "+ the background - subtracted lightcurves folded at the best period are shown in figure [ efold ] .",
    "the pulse profile is double peaked , with a pulsed fraction ( semiamplitude of sinusoidal modulation divided by the mean source count rate ; see @xcite for more details ) of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the fundamental and the second harmonic , respectively ( the above values correspond to @xmath36 in terms of root mean square , consistently with the 10% upper limit reported in @xcite ) .    within the statistical uncertainties",
    "the pulsed fraction is energy independent and no significant pulse shape variations as a function of energy were found by dividing the counts in soft and hard energy intervals . to assess this , we compared the folded lightcurves in various energy ranges using a two - dimensional kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test @xcite .",
    "the results show that the probability that they come from the same underlying distribution is always larger than 30% .",
    "+ knowing the spin period , we went back to archival data and looked for pulsations with enhanced sensitivity . however , our searches in the previous  observations , as well as in ,  and  data , were inconclusive .",
    "the most constraining limits on the pulsed fraction were obtained from  ( 1998 august ) and  ( 1999 february ) archival observations of .",
    "a fourier analysis of the background - subtracted light curves was performed by means of the method described in @xcite and no significant periodicity was found in the period interval 2.42.8 s ( identified by considering the 3@xmath1 upper limit on @xmath37 inferred above ) .",
    "the 3@xmath1 upper limits on the pulsed fraction ( as defined above ) , computed according to @xcite , are about 63% and 51% for the  and  data sets , respectively .      for the spectral fitting ( with xspec version 12.4 ; @xcite ) , data were grouped so as to have at least 30 counts per energy bin .",
    "the ancillary response files and the spectral redistribution matrices were generated with the sas tasks arfgen and rmfgen , respectively .",
    "we jointly fitted the spectra by pn , mos1 , and mos2 to blackbody , power law , and blackbody plus power law models , all corrected for interstellar absorption ( see table  [ spectable ] for the best - fit model parameters ) .",
    "+ the data disfavor the blackbody model ( @xmath38 for 152 degrees of freedom ( dof ) ) and also the power - law fit yields a relatively high @xmath39 value ( @xmath40 , 152 dof ) with structured residuals ( see figure [ spec ] ) .",
    "a better fit is obtained by a power law plus blackbody model ( @xmath41 , 150 dof ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are photon index @xmath6 , blackbody temperature @xmath7 kev , and absorption @xmath8 @xmath9 . for a distance of 11 kpc @xcite",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath5 @xmath42  ( 210 kev , unabsorbed ) .",

    "the energy - coded image of the field around  ( figure [ field ] ) shows that the source is embedded in a complex region of diffuse emission . a shell - shaped structure ( @xmath5 2 arcmin diameter ) with a softer spectrum than that of the sgr , as well as a bright spot of remarkably hard diffuse emission ( @xmath5 2 arcmin to the southwest of ) are apparent in figure [ field ] , where red and blue correspond to soft and hard x - ray photons , respectively .",
    "the combination of large absorption , source confusion and small photon statistics makes spectral analysis of such diffuse structures rather difficult . selecting photons from a @xmath5 @xmath59 rectangular region located between  and the hard spot , we observe the emission of the very faint diffuse shell to peak between 2 and 3 kev .",
    "using  imaging data of the field , we estimated the contribution of unresolved point - like sources to the diffuse shell to be of order 30% in the 1.73.1 kev energy range .",
    "the brightest point sources in the region are also resolved in the epic data below 1.7 kev , where the diffuse emission is not seen .",
    "the spectrum of the shell is adequately described ( @xmath60 , 106 dof ) by an absorbed ( @xmath61 @xmath9 ) hot plasma model ( pshock in xspec , @xmath62 kev ) , with clear indications for emission lines from s ( at 2.46 and 3.10 kev ) and possibly from fe ( at 6.4 kev ) and is therefore consistent with emission from a very absorbed snr .",
    "the net ( point source subtracted ) surface brightness of the structure is of @xmath5 @xmath63 erg @xmath9 s@xmath14 arcmin@xmath64 in the 1.73.1 kev band .     + the spectrum of the second , harder , diffuse structure was extracted using a 20 arcsec radius circle around the apparent centroid of the feature .",
    "the source emission emerges from background above @xmath5 2 kev and peaks around 5 kev .",
    "significant signal is detected up to 12 kev . a thermal plasma model ( mekal in xspec ,",
    "abundance parameter left free ) yields an acceptable description of the data ( @xmath65 , 53 dof ) , although the absorbing column and the temperature are not well constrained ( @xmath66 @xmath9 , @xmath67 kev at 90% confidence level for a single parameter ) .",
    "the possible presence of an emission feature at @xmath5 6.2 kev makes the fit improve after freeing the redshift parameter ( @xmath68 , 52 dof ; best - fit @xmath69 , pointing to fe emission at 6.9 kev in the source frame ) .",
    "the 210 kev flux of the source within the aperture is of @xmath5 @xmath70 .",
    "a possible interpretation is that this source is a background cluster of galaxies .",
    "we note that a simple absorbed ( @xmath71 @xmath9 ) power law ( @xmath72 ) also yields an acceptable fit ( @xmath65 , 53 dof ) .",
    "thus , the source could also be a pulsar wind nebula , unrelated to .",
    "we have discovered pulsations with period of 2.6 s in , which was the only known magnetar with no spin period yet measured .",
    "the pulse shape is double peaked , with pulsed fractions of @xmath5 @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the two harmonics .",
    "no dependence of the pulse profile on the energy band has been found . among the known magnetars ,",
    "only 1e1547.05408 has a shorter period ( 2.07 s ; @xcite ) than that of .",
    "we searched for a similar periodicity in all available archival data with sufficient time resolution , but no pulsation was found . relying only on the last  observation",
    "we could set an upper limit on the period derivative , @xmath35 s s@xmath14 which is not particularly constraining for a magnetar , and yields @xmath75 g. based on the peak luminosities of bursts observed from , its dipole magnetic field was estimated to be @xmath76 g @xcite .",
    "this limit can be used to infer a period derivative @xmath77 s s@xmath14 , a spin - down luminosity @xmath78 , and a characteristic age @xmath79 kyr .",
    "overall , and lacking any information on the pulsation period and profile in the past , we can only conclude that the timing properties of  reported here appear quite typical of a member of the sgr class .",
    "+ our observation caught  at a flux of @xmath4 , the highest seen with  and a factor of @xmath5 5 above the level preceding its 2008 may burst activation ( see figure  1 of @xcite for a complete flux history of the source ) .",
    "its spectrum was well fitted in earlier data by a single - component model , either a heavily absorbed power law or a blackbody @xcite .",
    "the higher - quality spectrum of the new data can not be adequately fitted by these simple models , while it is consistent with a power law plus blackbody model , and it is significantly harder than in any observation of  taken before 2008 may @xcite .",
    "the presence of a soft thermal component and the spectral hardening as the source moves from a quiescent to a ( burst ) active phase makes  akin to other sgrs and axps ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this latter behavior can be interpreted in the framework of the `` twisted - magnetosphere model '' as due to a progressive growth of the shear in the magnetosphere as magnetic helicity is transferred from the internal to the external field @xcite .",
    "+  has been proposed to be associated ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) to the radio snr g337.00.1 @xcite .",
    "the shell of diffuse soft radiation ( section  [ imaging ] ) , consistent with emission from a young snr at the distance of , is likely to be the first detection of this snr in x - rays . due to the complexity of the region , the extension of the snr at radio frequencies",
    "is debated : @xcite claimed a diameter of @xmath5 95 arcsec with  outside the shell , while @xcite proposed a different morphology extending the snr size towards the southwest and encompassing the sgr .",
    "the position and extension of the diffuse x - ray emission are consistent with the latter hypothesis , supporting the possible association between  and g337.00.1 .",
