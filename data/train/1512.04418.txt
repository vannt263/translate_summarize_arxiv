    "blurring is a common problem in digital imaging generally when pictures are taken with wrong focal length , camera shake , object motion , or shallow depth of field , to name a few @xcite . in this",
    "regards , blind image restoration problem involves restoration of image @xmath0 from a noisy observation @xmath1 , which contains less information provided by blur kernel @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is noise , and @xmath5 indicates the 2-d convolution operation .",
    "however , the blind restoration method is difficult as it is impossible to restore @xmath0 without a simultaneous restoration of @xmath2 .",
    "since the restorations of @xmath2 and @xmath0 are not jointly convex , the solution of blind restoration is highly dependent on the initial guess of @xmath2 or @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence can be lessened , but not completely removed , even through the imposition of convex regularizations on @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "several attempts have been made to regularize image @xmath0 , and all of them aimed to recover local high frequency components ( edges ) of @xmath0 from image @xmath1 .",
    "the widely adopted total variation approach , which implicitly models @xmath0 as a piecewise smooth function , intends to derive an image having a small total variation .",
    "sparse representation models @xmath0 as an element in a subspace which is spanned by a few unknown atoms in a dictionary .",
    "by contrast , there is no widely accepted regularization on the blur kernel @xmath2 .",
    "regularizations on @xmath2 vary widely from a parametric form ( a gaussian function with unknown standard deviation for handling out - of - focus blurring ) to @xmath6-norm on the support of @xmath2 ( for handling motion blurring ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel approach by imposing on @xmath2 a union of subspace models . in this approach",
    ", we assume that @xmath2 can be sparsely represented over a dictionary of atoms .",
    "we believe that this approach can set a connection between the various forms of regularizations on @xmath2 through the dictionary design .",
    "this approach will not only incorporate the parametric approach of imposition on @xmath2 ( through assumption of a dictionary of atoms , with each atom derived by certain parameter values ) , but it will also allow @xmath2 freedom to adapt to various applications , because the dictionary can be either for general purpose or trained for a specific application .    our mathematical model for blind image restoration is stated as follows , where images @xmath0 and @xmath1 are converted to vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a convex regularization term on image , @xmath11 $ ] is a tensor dictionary ( vector of matrices ) composed of basic blur kernel @xmath12 , and @xmath13^t$ ] is a column vector of real numbers .",
    "the notation @xmath2 is overloaded here with slightly different meanings in equations ( [ blurreq ] ) and ( [ onedblurr ] ) .",
    "the imposition of convex regularizations on @xmath7 and @xmath14 facilitates an alternative approach to deriving the solution .",
    "since each sub - problem , derived by fixing either @xmath0 or @xmath2 , is convex , the convergence of the approach is ensured .",
    "nevertheless , the solution is still dependent on the initial guess of @xmath2 or @xmath0 . to note , modelling @xmath2 as a sparse representation of @xmath15 has an edge on guessing the initial @xmath2 .",
    "if we have a dictionary of large number of atoms , a reasonable guess of @xmath2 to start an algorithm is a function that will contain only one atom in the dictionary ( this corresponds to approximation of @xmath2 by its dominating atom ) .    in this paper , we demonstrate our approach by constructing a dictionary of blurring patterns formed by the kronecker product of two 1-d gaussian functions of various scales .",
    "our dictionary assumes that the unknown blur kernel is sparse with respect to a mixture of out - of - focus gaussian type blurriness .",
    "although our dictionary is not generic for all types of blurriness , the construction process can be used to derive dictionaries for other types of blurriness .",
    "the initial guess of @xmath2 is derived from estimation of the out - of - focus blurriness in images .",
    "the image is estimated by the variable splitting technique and the blur kernel is generated by the efficient proximal gradient method .",
    "we also demonstrate our restoration results and compare the psnr performance with other blind restoration approaches .    _ notation . _    capital letters denote matrices and small letters denote vectors or scalars .",
    "the @xmath16 operation transfers a matrix into a vector by stacking one vector underneath the other .",
    "the inverse of @xmath16 is denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "if a capital letter is used to denote an image , the corresponding small letter will denote the vector obtained by applying @xmath16 on the image .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is an image , then @xmath7 is a vector with @xmath18 .",
    "we use @xmath19 to denote the kronecker product .",
    "applying @xmath16 on both sides of @xmath20 yields @xmath21    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ relatedwork ] reviews the related work .",
    "section [ pf ] formulates the blind restoration problem , models a blurring kernel as a sparse representation of a dictionary , and devises the procedure to construct the dictionary . in section [ na ] , an alternating minimization algorithm is proposed for blind restoration .",
    "some important steps of the algorithm are also discussed . in section [ er ] , we will report the tests conducted on monochrome and color image with various synthetic and real - life degradations and comparison of the results with other methods .",
    "section [ sec : con ] contains our concluding remarks .",
    "numerous approaches have been proposed to remove blurriness on observed images under various circumstances ( the deblurring problem ) .",
    "they can be roughly categorized , according to whether the blur kernel @xmath2 is spatially variant as well as how much information of the kernel is provided .",
    "some of the relevant studies have been listed in table [ table : relatedwork ] and categorized according to the problem addressed .",
    "although a large volume of work has been reported on deblurring problems , the current trend appears to shift from non - blind to blind category .",
    "the main technical challenge to resolve non - blind cases is imposition of regularizations on images . on the other hand ,",
    "the technical challenges for blind cases are the non - convexity of the problem , the determination of the blur kernel , and design of the regularizations on the blur kernel and the image .    among all different forms of regularizations on images , the total variation ( tv ) regularization function and its variations",
    "have been widely used @xcite .",
    "statistical models on the gradients of natural images have been adopted for image prior @xcite .",
    "sparse assumptions have been used to model representation coefficients for natural images in a transform domain @xcite or in an image domain @xcite .",
    "a counter - intuitive finding is reported in @xcite indicating that most cost functions for image prior prefer blurry images to sharp images , as blurry images have lower costs than sharp images .",
    "attempt is made in @xcite to achieve the lowest cost for true sharp image by introducing an @xmath22 function on images .",
    "the spatially variant cases are solved by dividing an image into blocks ( of size depending on the supports of blur kernels ) and then processing each block independently by a spatially invariant method .",
    "computational complexity is one of the main concerns for the spatially variant methods , because fast fourier transformation ( fft ) can be applied only to spatially invariant cases but not to spatially variant ones .",
    "some fast algorithms based on variable splitting techniques and proximal point methods have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "for example , the variable splitting technique is used in @xcite for the tv approach and in @xcite for statistical modelling of image gradients .",
    "another topic of concern is the removal of boundary effects incurred from dividing an image into blocks @xcite such as the matting approach adopted in @xcite .    as mentioned in @xcite , more the information of a blur kernel available for blind image restoration , better is the restoration performance achieved .",
    "contrary to the regularizations on images , regularizations on blur kernels are more complicated because of the complex nature of the practical blurring processes .",
    "depending on the sources of the blurriness of images , attempts have been made for regularizations on blur kernels .",
    "if the source of blurriness is motion of camera or objects , the blur kernel displays a trajectory with sharp edges , and can be modelled as a function of sparse support @xcite or of a small total variation@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the source is due to out - of - focus in camera parameter , then a gaussian type of smoothing is usually used to model the blurriness @xcite .",
    "a learning - based approach is also proposed to derive a blur kernel from an ensemble of training data @xcite .",
    "recently , ji and wang @xcite analyzed the robustness issue of blind image restoration , and they reported that sometimes few errors on the estimated blind kernels can cause significant errors in the image reconstruction process .",
    "they introduced a model that can explicitly take into account the blur kernel estimation error in the regularization process in order to obtain restoration results that are robust to modelling errors of blur kernels .",
