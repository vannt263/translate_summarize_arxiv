    "the study of the anisotropies in the arrival directions of cosmic rays ( cr ) provides a handle , together with the spectrum and composition studies , to face several open questions in the field like : which are the sources of cosmic rays ?",
    ", how do crs propagate ?",
    ", which is the cr composition ?",
    ", how are the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields ?",
    "the cosmic ray flux has proven to be very close to isotropic and thus very careful studies are needed to measure the anisotropies . before entering the discussion of the techniques used , which are the main scope of these lectures , we will review some topics that are relevant to understand the kind of anisotropies that can be expected in different energy ranges .",
    "these are : the matter distribution in our neighbourhood , the galactic and extragalactic magnetic field effects on the cr propagation ( deflections , flux amplification , multiple images ) and the greisen zatsepin kuzmin ( gzk ) horizon .",
    "the distribution of matter around us is not isotropic .",
    "the milky way is a spiral galaxy .",
    "the disk , that has a width of about 1 kpc ( 1 pc @xmath0 3 ly ) , contains in the spiral arms most of the visible stars , as well as atomic gas with a density of approximately one particle per @xmath1 .",
    "the solar system is located at 8.5 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "a regular magnetic field component permeates the disk .",
    "the galaxy is also permeated by a turbulent magnetic field where charged cosmic ray particles are trapped and that probably extends few kpc outside the disk .",
    "the galaxy has also a spheroid ( or stellar halo ) of more spherical shape constituted by an older stellar population and a smaller amount of gas ( with density @xmath2@xmath1 ) , that extends up to a distance of about 15 kpc .",
    "it has a central bulge with a bar - like shape .",
    "a larger dark matter halo is also present , which existence is evidenced by its gravitational effects , such as the rotation curves of stars and gas that remain flat up to distances larger than those containing the visible matter , but its composition is not yet known .",
    "the galaxy has also a massive black hole in the center with a mass of few @xmath3m@xmath4 .",
    "the milky way and its neighbour galaxy andromeda are the most prominent members of a small cluster of about 30 galaxies called the local group , with a diameter of about 2 mpc .    the local group forms part of the local supercluster , a large agglomerate of about 100 galaxy clusters and groups , that is dominated by the virgo cluster located near its center ( distant about 18 mpc from the milky way ) .",
    "virgo is a large cluster , with more than 2000 galaxies , including the prominent radio galaxy m87 .    at even larger scales",
    "the distribution of clusters shows an inhomogeneous distribution with large filaments and voids . only at scales larger than few hundred",
    "mpc the universe starts to look homogeneous .",
    "the galactic magnetic field has a regular and a turbulent component . despite a considerable observational effort ,",
    "both are still poorly known @xcite . from the observation of polarized radio emission of other face - on spiral galaxies",
    "it is known that the regular magnetic field follows the spiral pattern of the stars distribution , while radio polarization measurements in edge - on galaxies show the existence of magnetic halos extending few kpc above and below the galactic disks .    in our own galaxy ,",
    "faraday rotation measures of pulsars and extragalactic radio sources indicate that the regular magnetic field follows the spiral pattern in the disk , with a local value @xmath5 g . @xcite . the turbulent field is thought to be larger in rms amplitude than the regular one , with a coherence length of approximately 100 pc .",
    "the propagation of charged crs is affected by the magnetic fields ( both galactic and extragalactic ) present along their trajectories .",
    "the deflection of ultra - relativistic charged particles is proportional to their charges and inversely proportional to their energy    @xmath6    then , the direction of propagation is given by    @xmath7    a cr of charge @xmath8 and energy @xmath9 in a constant field @xmath10 describes a circle of larmor radius    @xmath11    then , for @xmath12 ev ( @xmath13 1 eev ) cosmic ray trajectories wind around the magnetic field lines and they remain confined by the galactic magnetic field for a long time , while for larger energies their trajectories are only moderately perturbed and they are not confined in the galaxy . for @xmath14",
    "ev they scatter off the turbulent magnetic field irregularities , that have a coherence scale @xmath15 , make a random walk and diffuse .",
    "[ [ liouville - theorem ] ] liouville theorem + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    an isotropic flux of crs remains isotropic after propagating through a magnetic field . according to the liouville theorem",
    "the phase space distribution @xmath16 is constant along cosmic ray trajectories if there are no processes that dis troy or create particles .",
    "the intensity of crs , defined as the number of particles crossing a unit area @xmath17 per unit time @xmath18 and unit solid angle @xmath19 with energy within @xmath9 and @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 and we can write @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . then @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath26 is constant along the trajectory , @xmath27 is also constant . as a consequence , an isotropic cr flux remains isotropic unless there is a shadowing effect , i.e. there exist directions from which particles can not reach the detector coming from infinity .",
    "for example at low energies this happens because of the earth ` shadow ' : trajectories of antiparticles leaving from the detector hit the earth due to the deflections in the geomagnetic field .",
    "this in particular gives rise to the so - called east - west effect : protons with energy smaller than few gev are not able to reach the earth from the east .",
    "the sign of this e - w asymmetry was used to infer that cr primaries are positively charged . towards the poles the threshold is smaller and",
    "this has the effect of increasing the cr intensity with latitude at low energies ( latitude effect ) .",

    "if the galactic @xmath10 field ( and composition ) were known , one could correct the arrival direction to search for the source .",
    "this could be done by ` backtracking antiparticles ' leaving the detector with the reverse velocity of the incoming cr . according to the liouville theorem",
    "the magnetic fields can not produce anisotropies in an isotropic flux , but they do in fact affect anisotropic fluxes in different ways : the flux can be amplified in some regions and deamplified in others in an energy dependent way , and even multiple images of sources located in some regions can appear .",
    "these effects can be visualized plotting for a regular grid of arrival directions at earth the corresponding directions from which the particles arrived to the galactic halo .",
    "this is shown in figure [ skysheet ] for a particular model of the regular magnetic field and for particles with @xmath29 = 20 eev .",
    "one may picture this distorted image of the sky seen from the earth as a sheet ( the ` sky sheet ' ) that can be stretched and folded .",
    "a source located in a fold of this sky sheet will have multiple images , i.e. cosmic rays of the same energy can arrive to the earth from several different directions .",
    "moreover , the flux coming from a source in a region where the sheet is stretched will appear demagnified while that from a source in a compressed region will appear magnified @xcite .",
    "if several crs with different energies coming from one source are detected it would be possible to measure the integrated perpendicular component of the magnetic field along the cr trajectory and locate the actual source position .",
    "magnetic lensing phenomena also appear for turbulent fields @xcite .",
    "the deflections in a turbulent field can be viewed as a random walk of the cr particles that suffer in each field domain a deflection in a random direction .",
    "the accumulated deflection after traversing a distance @xmath30 in a field with coherence length @xmath31 is given by    @xmath32 ,    where the last factor corresponds to the mean deflection in one domain .",
    "for @xmath33 , deflections in the turbulent field are smaller than those produced by the regular field , but can dominate the magnetic lensing effects .",
    "multiple images appear below a critical energy @xmath34 , such that typical transverse displacements among different paths become of order the correlation length of the @xmath10 field ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "typically @xmath36g@xmath37kpc@xmath38pc@xmath39 . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the number of images grows exponentially .",
    "a regime is reached with a large number of images , spread over a region of size @xmath41 and with mean magnification @xmath42 ( like twinkling stars ) .",
    "magnetic fields are also present outside galaxies , but the observational constraints are still very poor .",
    "the amplitude in the central region of clusters may reach the @xmath43 g .",
    "the distribution is believed to follow the filamentary pattern of the large scale matter distribution . in most of the space",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath44 g and the coherence length @xmath45mpc .",
    "soon after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation it was realized by greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite that the fluxes of cr protons with energies of order @xmath46 ev and above would be strongly attenuated over distances of a few tens of mpc .",
    "this is due to the energy losses caused by the photo - pion production processes in the interactions of the protons with the cmb photons .",
    "similarly , if cr sources accelerate heavy nuclei , these can photo - disintegrate into lighter ones as they interact with cmb and infrared ( ir ) photons on their journey to us . in this way",
    "the fragments may arrive at the earth with significantly smaller energies than the parent nuclei produced at the sources .",
    "moreover , both protons and heavy nuclei can further loose energy by pair production processes , although due to the small inelasticities involved the typical attenuation length associated with @xmath47 production at ultra - high energies is large ( @xmath0 1 gpc for protons ) . these processes",
    "limit the distance from which ultra - high energy cosmic rays can arrive to the earth . for example , at energies above @xmath48 eev , cosmic rays should mostly come from nearby sources : in the hypothesis of an homogeneous distribution of sources , @xmath49 of the flux should come from sources closer than @xmath50 mpc and @xmath51 from sources closer than @xmath52 mpc .",
    "the distance limits turn out to be similar for iron nuclei ( although the responsible processes are different ) , while lighter nuclei should come from a much closer neighbourhood @xcite .      for any cr anisotropy analysis",
    "it is very important to have a good estimate of the expected flux in any direction for the given experimental setup in the case the cr flux is isotropic .",
    "the exposure measures the time integrated effective collecting area in units of km@xmath53 yr . for each direction of the sky",
    "@xmath54 gives the relative exposure . for a detector in continuous operation it is uniform in right ascension @xmath55 , being only a function of the declination @xmath56 .",
    "if the detector is fully efficient for particles arriving with zenith angle @xmath57 , the exposure has only a @xmath58 modulation due to the change in the effective detection area .",
    "the zenith of a detector located at latitude @xmath59 corresponds to a position in the celestial sphere given @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the right ascension of the detector zenith .",
    "a source in a direction @xmath62 is seen at a zenithal angle @xmath63 .",
    "the exposure towards a direction @xmath64 is proportional to the integral of @xmath65 for all the times when @xmath66 , and is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ( if @xmath69 ) with @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( if @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 ( if @xmath74 ) @xcite .",
    "the exposure is shown in figure [ expo ] for a detector at latitude @xmath75 , corresponding to the pierre auger observatory .",
    "perfect exposure holds for a continuously operating detector at the highest energies where every shower triggers the detector . at lower energies the more inclined showers are more attenuated than the vertical ones and are less effective to trigger the detector , and then the exposure is no longer just proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "there are two main strategies to compute the exposure in these cases : a semi - analytical method that consists in obtaining the zenith angle distribution from the data itself and then proceed as before with the integration in @xmath77 , or the shuffling technique that consists in simulating a large number of fake events using the time and zenith angle distribution of real events from which the isotropic expectation can be obtained .",
    "different signals of anisotropies are expected to appear at different energies due to the different sources and propagation effects involved that we will briefly discuss here .    at the highest energies",
    "the magnetic deflections are expected to be small and the gzk horizon limits the distance from which cr can arrive , then we might expect to observe only events coming from nearby sources .",
    "the expected signals are then : small scale clustering of events coming from the same source , correlation of events with a population of source candidates , intermediate scale clustering reflecting the clustering of local sources .",
    "lowering the energy , the deflections increase and the gzk horizon also increases , then the cr flux is expected to become more isotropic , but we can still expect some intermediate scale clustering and correlation with the sources distribution . although the distribution is expected to become more isotropic when lowering the energy , the increase in statistics should help to detect the smaller anisotropy signal . at even lower energies ,",
    "a large scale anisotropy signal coming from the diffusion and drifts of cr in the galactic magnetic field is expected to be seen .",
    "if there is a neutral component of crs a point - like signal is expected and a correlation with the source population at the angular resolution scale should appear .",
    "in addition to these intrinsic anisotropies in the cr arrival direction , there is also a large scale anisotropy signal expected from the motion of the detector with respect to the cr rest frame , the so - called compton getting effect .",
    "we will now discuss some of the techniques that are used to measure the anisotropies in the cr intensity @xmath27 , that is defined as the number of particles per unit solid angle that pass per unit time through a unit of area perpendicular to the direction of observation @xmath78 .",

    "a dipole gives rise to an intensity @xmath81 .",
    "the amplitude is defined as @xmath82 .",
    "the most usual methods to detect a dipole are one dimensional : they only study the right ascension distribution ( of the full data set or in a fixed declination band ) .",
    "the reason is that some experiments can not reliably determine the dependence of the exposure in the declination .",
    "the most standard analysis technique is the rayleigh method , that performs an harmonic analysis in right ascension @xcite . for @xmath83 events with right ascension @xmath84 ,",
