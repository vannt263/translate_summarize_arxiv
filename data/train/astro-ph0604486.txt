    "angular momentum transport has long been recognised as a key issue in accretion disc theories @xcite .",
    "however , until the 1990s , a viable physical mechanism necessary to facilitate this transport in the absence of tidal effects or gravitational instabilities was unknown .",
    "the balbus - hawley ( or magnetorotational ) instability @xcite was proposed @xcite as a viable mechanism that can efficiently drive mhd turbulence and transport angular momentum in the disc .",
    "this opened the door for its application to a wide variety of astrophysical discs .",
    "the requirement for the magnetorotational instabilityto operate in such a disc is that the ambient magnetic field is subthermal at the disc midplane and is well coupled to the disc matter .",
    "although , the lower bound on the weak , subthermal field has never been specified , in recent work this issue has been addressed in the framework of fully ionized , collisionless cold electron - ion plasma @xcite . for a highly ionized disc ,",
    "the requirement of a weak , subthermal field is easily satisfied and the magnetorotational instabilitygrows at the rotation frequency @xmath0 of the disc as a low frequency mode with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the wavenumber and @xmath3 is the velocity .",
    "however , many astrophysical discs are not well coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "circumstellar , protoplanetary ( ppd ) , dwarf novae ( dn ) , and , proto - neutron - star discs are good examples of weakly ionized discs with very low to low ( ppds ) and high ( dns ) fractional ionization . in ppds for example",
    ", the sources of ionization are limited to the disc surface and magnetorotational instabilitymay operate only in the outer envelope of the disc @xcite unless some nonthermal source of ionization viz .",
    "the collision of the energetic electrons with neutrals or magnetorotational instabilityinduced turbulent convective homogenization of the entire disc @xcite is assumed .",
    "dn discs are thought to have both hot and fully ionized accretion state as well as cold and mostly neutral accretion states @xcite .",
    "therefore , the direct application of @xcite results are difficult in a weakly ionized disc .",
    "the effect of non - ideal mhd on the magnetorotational instabilityhas been investigated by several authors : in the ambipolar regime @xcite , hereafter bb94 , @xcite , the resistive regime @xcite and the hall regime @xcite w99 hereafter ; @xcite , bt01 hereafter ; @xcite . at the densities relevant to cloud cores ,",
    "ambipolar and hall diffusion plays an important role in the transport of mass and angular momentum @xcite . w99 and bt01 found that collision of neutrals with the ionized gas in a weakly ionized disc determines the relative importance of ambipolar , hall or ohmic diffusion on the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the ambipolar and hall effects are particularly important when the ionization in the disc is very low and the departure from ideal mhd is severe .",
    "the dynamics of a weakly ionized disc was investigated in the limit of zero inertia of the ionized plasma components by w99 and bt01 .",
    "this is usually an excellent approximation when the fractional ionization is low , and allows the ionized components of the fluid ( viz electrons , ions and grains ) to be treated on an equal footing .",
    "however , there are situations  even in the low fractional ionisation limit  where the inertia of the charged species is important in determining their drift with respect to the neutral component and hence the diffusion of the magnetic field . in the weakly - ionised limit",
    "this becomes important when the inertial terms in the ion equation of motion start to compete with the magnetic and neutral collision terms , in other words when the disc frequency @xmath0 becomes comparable to or exceeds the collision frequency with neutrals _ and _ the gyrofrequency .",
    "this effect may become important for charged dust grains because their large mass implies low collision and gyrofrequencies .",
    "for example , in dense ppds , the dominant ion species are positively charged grains ( especially when @xmath4 ) , @xcite . in the high fractional ionization regions also , e.g. near the surface of a magnetic cataclysmic variable , ion inertia may become important @xcite . the effect of ion - inertia on the magnetorotational instabilityin a two - fluid framework was considered by bb94 .",
    "the magnetic flux was assumed frozen into the plasma component in their formulation .",
    "this limits the applicabilty of their results to the ambipolar diffusion regime",
    ". we know from w99 and bt01 that hall effect can compete with ambipolar diffusion in the weakly ionized regions of the disc . in the present work we adopt a three component model ",
    "neutrals , ions and electrons where by `` ion '' and `` electron '' we mean the most massive and least massive charged species , whether positively or negatively charged  to show that ion inertial effects modify the growth rate substantially and increases the parameter window in which the instability may operate . in particular , the growth rate in the presence of ion inertia may exceed the oort a value ( @xmath5 ) limit .",
    "growth rates larger than the oort a limit have recently been reported for collisionless plasmas in the presence of plasma kinetic / viscous effects @xcite , where kinetic and mhd effects combine to give a high growth rate ( @xmath6 ) and shift the fastest growing modes towards longer wavelengths .",
    "we shall give a general formulation of the problem that will not only cover the regions of applicability of bb94 and w99 but also cover the unexplored regions .",
    "this paper revisits the magnetorotational instability in a weakly ionized disc ( w99 ) by incorporating the effect of ion inertia . in section 2",
    ", we discuss formulation of bb94 and compare and contrast the region of applicability of bb94 , w99 in the context of present work . in section 3 , a general formulation of a weakly ionized , near - keplerian , magnetized disc is given . in section 4",
    "we describe equilibrium and linearization of the disc and derive the dispersion relation .",
    "section 5 discusses the energetics of a weakly ionized , magnetized disc . in this section , we first discuss the role played by the ambipolar and hall terms in the neutral dynamics .",
    "further , using energy arguments , we discuss the conditions under which ambipolar diffusion can proceed without dissipation and when ambipolar diffusion can destabilize the disc .",
    "we also discuss how thehall term can destabilize the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the properties of wave helicity , is derived . in section 6 ,",
    "we give the detailed numerical solution of the dispersion relation . in section 7 ,",
    "application of the result to various astrophysical discs is discussed .",
    "section 8 presents a summary of our results .",
    "bb94 adopted the ambipolar diffusion approximation , in which the magnetic field is frozen into an electrically neutral ionised plasma coupled by collisions to the neutral fluid .",
    "the effect of ion inertia on the dynamics ( @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ion mass density and @xmath9 is the convective derivative ) , is retained in the momentum equation for the ionised component but its effect on ohm s law is ignored in bb94 .",
    "this limits the applicability of the results to the ambipolar diffusion limit .    to better appreciate this point ,",
    "let us briefly recast the two fluid formulation of bb94 starting with seperate ion and electron fluid equations .",
    "the equation of motion for the ionised fluid is derived assuming that magnetic field is frozen in the electron fluid , @xmath10 and summing the electron and ion momentum equations , to yield @xmath11 equation ( 15 ) of bb94 .",
    "here @xmath12 is the electronic charge , @xmath13 is the electron number density , @xmath14 is the ion - neutral collision frequency , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the electron , ion and neutral velocities , @xmath17 is the gravitational potential , @xmath18 is the ion pressure , @xmath19 are the electric and magnetic fields and @xmath20 is the speed of light and @xmath21 is the current density .",
    "taking the curl of ( [ eq : elmotion ] ) and using maxwell s equation , @xmath22 , will give @xmath23 , i.e. the magnetic field is convected away by the electron fluid .",
    "if we want to express the right hand side of induction equation in terms of ion velocity , we obtain @xmath24 where the hall term is @xmath25    since @xmath26 ( here @xmath14 is the ion - neutral collision frequency ) , the hall term can be dropped from the induction equation only if @xmath27 , i.e. the ion - gyration period ( @xmath28 ) is smaller/ faster than the dynamical time ( @xmath29 ) or the ion - neutral collision time ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we see that unlike a two component electron - ion plasma , where the hall term can be introduced only through the ion inertial term ( @xmath31 ) , in a weakly ionized multi - component plasma , the hall effect appears either via ion - neutral collision or via the @xmath31 term or both . replacing @xmath32 by @xmath33 and @xmath34 by @xmath35 one sees that the hall term scales as @xmath36 , ( here @xmath37 is the ion plasma frequency and @xmath38 is the characteristic size of the system ) , i.e. the hall term is important on a scale shorter than the ion - inertial scale . clearly , hall mhd introduces two disparate , interacting scales , a microscopic scale , i.e. the ion - skin depth ( @xmath39 ) and a macroscopic scale , the disc size .",
    "the hall term can be dropped if ion - inertial effects are unimportant .",
    "leaving out the effect of inertia in the induction equation but retaining them in dynamics is not consistent and , in such a scenario , one would expect that magnetorotational instabilitywill merely shift towards long wavelength , as has already been noted by bb94 .    if we start with the ion equation of motion ( bb94 ( 15 ) ) , and express the electric field as = - + [ eq : efi ] where @xmath40 , then taking the curl and using maxwell s equation , one arrives at the following induction equation = ( ) - .",
    "here uniform density is assumed while operating with the curl on equation ( [ eq : efi ] ) .",
    "this equation has an additional term in comparision with equation ( 16 ) of bb94 , with important consequences on the magnetic diffusivity , since the rate of change of magnetic flux is given as @xmath41\\cdot \\ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] making use of equation ( 6 ) in ( 7 ) , we get @xmath42\\cdot \\ds\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath43 and use has been made of @xmath44 .",
    "the ion hall parameter @xmath45 gives the ratio between the ion - cyclotron to ion - neutral collision frequencies .",
    "the above equation can be rewritten as = - _ d .",
    "[ eq : flux_transport ] we see from equation ( [ eq : flux_transport ] ) that the generalized flux that is a combination of magnetic flux and vorticity is not conserved . the rate at which this flux decays is directly related to the collisional coupling between ions and neutrals . if the ion magnetization is weak , i.e. the ion - cyclotron frequency is less than ion - neutral collision frequency ( @xmath46 ) , then the flux - decay rate could be very large for a finite ion - neutral drift speed @xmath47 .",
    "however , if the relative ion - neutral drift is negligible , the generalized flux is conserved irrespective of the ion magnetization level .",
    "thus it is the combination of the magnetic flux and the vorticity that is conserved in the absence of collision ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the bb94 formulation assumes that magnetic flux is frozen in the ion - fluid which is valid if apart from ignoring the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : flux_transport ] ) , we also assume that @xmath49 . in this limit however , the role of ion inertia becomes increasingly unimportant and we approach w99 limit .",
    "clearly , bb94 does not treat the effect of ion inertia in a consistent fashion and their results are not applicable in most of the weakly ionized parameter space where the ion hall parameter is @xmath50 .",
    "in fig.1 , we plot the range of applicability of bb94 and w99 .",
    "we see that bb94 is applicable when @xmath51 for @xmath52 for arbitrary relation between @xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "bt01 show that @xmath53 implies that the hall term dominates over ambipolar term .",
    "w99 is applicable for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for arbitrary @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is an unexplored region in bb94 and w99 framework .",
    "we see that in a ppd , for a milligauss field , for a positive grains of mass @xmath59 , @xmath57 . as has been noted elsewhere , near the mid - plane of ppds , dust grains can be the dominant charged constituent over extended regions ( @xmath60 au ) . for sub - micron sized grains @xmath61 , negatively charged grains dominate whenever @xmath62 and positively charged grains dominate for @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "depending upon neutral density in the disc , the ratio @xmath64 can have any value and thus , it is importnat to extend the bb94 analysis to the unexplored regions with full , hall and ambipolar effects in the spirit of w99 .",
    "we shall give a general derivation of the induction equation in a weakly ionized medium in the text though , we adopt the conductivity approach of w99 to investigate the effect of ion inertia on the magnetorotational instability and find a significant increase in the growth rate .",
    "further , the parameter window in which instability operates expands considerably to large scale lengths . it will have an important bearing on the angular momentum transport and onset of turbulence .",
    "the dynamics of a weakly ionized disc , consisting of electrons , ions , neutrals and charged and neutral dust grains , in the presence of a gravitational field @xmath17 of a central mass point @xmath65 is described by a set of multifluid equations .",
    "a multi - fluid approach representing each and every particle species is not very fruitful since depending upon the fractional ionization , the presence of some of the ionized component in the disc can be neglected .",
    "we shall assume that the ion density in the disc is mainly due to the presence of positively charged grains .",
    "such a situation will correspond to a very dense region of ppds @xcite .",
    "as the disc matter is weakly ionized , generally the inertia of the charged species are neglected ( w99 ) .",
    "however , apart from pure scientific curiosity about the effect of charged particle inertia on the magnetorotational instability , there are astrophysical environments where the plasma inertial effects may become important . for example , ion inertial effect may compete with collisional and electromagnetic effects in the dense region of ppds as well as in the high fractional ionization discs around magnetic cataclysmic variables .",
    "an estimate of the ion inertial , collisional and electromagnetic effects are given below .",
    "since we wish to investigate the role of ion dynamics on the magnetorotational instability , we shall retain the inertia term in the ion equation of motion .",
    "this will result in conductivity tensor @xmath66 becoming frequency dependent .",

    "when ion inertial effects are ignored , the expressions for @xmath188 , in equations ( [ qa])-([qc ] ) reduces to w99 .",
    "ideal mhd is recovered in @xmath189 limit . as has been discussed in w99",
    ", the hall term has considerable effect on the magnetorotational instabilitygrowth rate ( @xmath190 ) in the small @xmath186 limit .",
    "this is because the hall effect and collisions are intricately linked in a partially ionized plasma .",
    "since the hall effect is due to ion - neutral collision , small wavelength fluctuations are supressed in the hall regime and only long wavelength fluctuations will grow .",
    "we shall see that both hall as well as ambipolar diffusion will become important in the small @xmath186 , high frequency limit , suggesting that the presence of ion inertial effect destabilizes the weakly ionized disc at all wavelengths .",
    "before we discuss numerical results , lets examine the various factors ( viz .",
    "lorentz force , joule heating ) that may affect magnetorotational instability . the lorentz force , @xmath191 , acts on the neutrals through collisions .",
    "making use of equation ( [ olaw ] ) , it can be written as = ( _ p+ _ h ) .",
    "here @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 is the drift velocity of @xmath115 through the neutrals .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is a measure of simultaneous acceleration and frictional drag ; viewd from a neutral frame , this force accelerates the neutral towards @xmath195 velocity .",
    "the parameter @xmath196 provides the strength of the collisional coupling . with decreasing @xmath196 ,",
    "i.e. when the ionized medium is far from ideal mhd regime , this term may become increasingly unimportant .",
    "thus the modification to the ideal mhd modes will be severe in the small @xmath196 limit since collision modifies the fluid response to the magnetic tension .",
    "note that in the ambipolar regime , this term is responsible for dissipation as well as feeding of energy to the neutrals .",
    "the second term will accelerate the neutral in the direction of @xmath197 . in order to understand the implications for the magnetorotational instability ,",
    "we need to identify the conditions under which energy is fed to the fluctuations . recall that the electric field @xmath198 is given in the neutral frame and thus , @xmath199 clearly then , the energy exchange consists of joule heating and acceleration of the neutral medium .",
    "the term @xmath200 is the joule heating .",
    "this term is always positive for positive @xmath201 .",
    "however , since @xmath138 may become negative near resonance and the ohmic term @xmath202 may feed rather than dissipate energy .",
    "therefore , in the ambipolar regime , fluctuations may grow .",
    "the terms @xmath203 and @xmath204 , for ambipolar and hall respectively , corresponds to the feeding or , extraction of the kinetic energy by the lorentz force .",
    "therefore , depending upon the sign of the kinetic energy terms , the lorentz force may facilitate either growth or damping of the magnetorotational instability .",
    "we shall solve the dispersion relation ( [ drf ] ) numerically in various limiting cases and discuss modifications due to ion inertia . in the absence of ion inertia , various @xmath186 limits and its effect on the magnetorotational instabilityhave",
    "been discussed in detail in w99 .",
    "we assume that electrons are frozen in the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath205 . in this limit , @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , we shall solve the dispersion relation ( [ drf ] ) by varying key parameters @xmath186 , @xmath56 and @xmath207 . in accretion disc environment , the value of @xmath56 , may vary in a wide range .",
    "we shall choose @xmath56 between @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "although higher value of @xmath56 can be chosen , the growth rate of magnetorotational instabilitywill be very small .",
    "the parameter @xmath210 is similarly varied in a wide range .      in fig .",
    "2(a ) we plot the growth rate by varying @xmath56 while keeping @xmath212 and @xmath213 fixed . with the decreasing @xmath56 , the parameter window of magnetorotational instabilityextends towards short wavelength and the growth rate exceeds ideal mhd limit for @xmath214 . with the decrease in @xmath56 when @xmath215 , the mode grows upto @xmath216 for @xmath214 .",
    "this can be possibly attributed to the fact that owing to the faster collisional ( and keplerian ) time scales in comparison with the gyration time , rotational free energy becomes available to the fluctuations at the collisional time scale . for further decrease in the value of @xmath56 to @xmath217 , the maximum growth rate decreases .",
    "this behaviour indicates that if @xmath56 is increased beyond some critical value , the hall diffusion is dominated by the ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the growth rate for @xmath218 curve is small .",
    "this regime correspond to @xmath219 , i.e. the rate of ion gyration and collision with the neutrals is comparable with the rotational frequency . with the increase of @xmath56 ,",
    "the growth rate decreases and disappears altogether for very large @xmath56 .",
    "thus , hall effect ( caused by the ion inertial and collisional effects ) , starts dominating the ambipolar diffusion and the mode starts growing .",
    "further decrease in @xmath56 and increase in hall conductivity reduces the growth rate to @xmath220 .",
    "the collisional effect weakens with decreased @xmath56 and thus , the parameter window operates in both small and large wavelength regimes .           in fig .",
    "2(b ) the growth rate is given for varying @xmath186 and fixed @xmath222 . with the decreasing @xmath186 ( i.e. increasing collisional coupling ) , the wavenumber window of the instability shifts towards long wavelength , consistent with the fact that non - ideal mhd effects start playing an increasingly important role for smaller @xmath186 .",
    "the result is similar to w99 .",
    "this result is also in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we see that with the decreasing @xmath186 the growth rate remains unchanged .",
    "only change is in the wavenumber window that shifts towards the long wavelength consistent with the hall dominated result of w99 .    in fig .",
    "2(c ) we plot the growth rate for @xmath223 and @xmath224 for varying @xmath221 .",
    "the results are along the expected line . with the increase in collision , the growth rate decreases due to increased role of dissipation and the parameter window of instability shifts towards long wavelength .",
    "when the ion - neutral collision rate is comparable ( or smaller ) to the rotational frequency , the mri is unaffected by the collision .",
    "this is because the rate of dissipative loss of the energy is comparable or slower than the rotational time scale @xmath225 .",
    "thus dissipation stops affecting the growth rate and it saturates around @xmath226 .",
    "further decrease of @xmath221 does not affect the growth rate .          in figure 3(a )",
    "we plot the growth rate for the positive orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the rotation axis , i.e. @xmath228 . the results are similar to the known results of w99 . however , there are some interesting differences towards small @xmath186 limit . whereas , the wavenumber window of magnetorotational instabilityshifts towards longer wavelengths in small @xmath186 limit , the growth rate of instability is not very sensitive .",
    "the ion inertia is able to provide the free energy to the fluctuations that can counterbalance the dissipative losses in small @xmath186 regime where collision coupling between ion and neutral is very strong .",
    "thus , with the decrease in the value of @xmath186 , small wavelength fluctuations are all suppressed leaving large wavelength modes to grow at @xmath229 .    in figure 3(b ) we plot the growth rate against @xmath210 .",
    "we see that when @xmath230 i.e. , when collision time @xmath231 is smaller than the rotational time @xmath232 , and the free energy is dissipated by the collision .",
    "the growth rate of fluctuations decreases .",
    "we see from the plot that with increasing @xmath221 the magnetorotational instabilitygrowth rate reduces significantly .",
    "however , the growth rate becomes insensitive beyond @xmath233 .",
    "this indicates that in the large @xmath221 limit , ion inertial effect , namely hall effect starts cancelling dissipation and thus , growth rate becomes insensitive to any further increase of @xmath221 . in the opposite limit , i.e. when @xmath234 ( or , @xmath235 ) , the energy available to the fluctuation is at the rotational time scale and , infrequent , slow ion - neutral collision is unable to influence the growth of the instability . at @xmath236 ,",
    "the growth rate becomes maximum @xmath237 and any further decrease in @xmath221 do not change the growth rate significantly .      in figure 4(a ) and 4(b ) we plot the growth rate for @xmath239 by varying @xmath186 and @xmath221 respectively . in figure 4(a ) the growth rate is slightly smaller than for corresponding case in fig .",
    "3(a ) for s=1 . for @xmath240",
    "the growth rate is insensitive to the changing value of @xmath186 implying that if collision frequency is an order of magnitude smaller than the keplerian frequency , the ambipolar effects are entirely compensated by the hall and the growth rate remains constant .",
    "the curves are similar to w99 except that the mode exists for much smaller value of @xmath186 than was the case in w99 .",
    "also , the growth rate is larger . the growth rate increases with increasing @xmath186 and attains maximum value for @xmath241 .",
    "if @xmath186 is increased further , there is no change in the growth rate .",
    "the rate at which rotational energy becomes available and dissipation operates become comparable . for @xmath242 , the ideal mhd limit is approached and thus the effect of collision diminishes .",
    "thus for @xmath243 the growth rate is maximum .    in figure 4(b ) the growth rate is not very sensitive to change in @xmath221 except when it becomes large . for large @xmath221",
    "the growth rate reduces in comparison with the small @xmath221 values and parameter window extends towards smaller wavelength .          in fig .",
    "5(a ) we plot the growth rate for @xmath245 for varying @xmath186 .",
    "the growth rate is insensitive when @xmath246 .",
    "small @xmath186 is a measure of departure from ideal mhd and we note that hall effects play important role for @xmath246 . since for @xmath247 the sign of the wave helicity @xmath248 is negative since wave is propagating in the negative direction ( [ hel2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the increase in the non - ideal effect , manifested through hall terms , does not have any bearing on the growth rate . with the increase of @xmath186 the magnetorotational instabilitygrowth rate",
    "approaches ideal limit .    in fig .",
    "5(b ) the variation of growth rate with @xmath221 is given .",
    "for @xmath234 there is no change in the growth rate .",
    "for @xmath249 the instability is damped due to dissipation .",
    "the sign of the helicity ensures that non ideal effect do not feed the energy to the fluctuations .",
    "thus we see the decrease in the growth rate with increasing @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , we see that in the general case when the ambipolar conductivity may change , the growth rate of the instability becomes larger than the rotation frequency and the instability operates at long wavelengths .",
    "thus , the ion - inertial effect introduces entirely new feature to the dynamics of a weakly magnetized disc .",
    "not only it changes the length scale over which the instability can operate but also , how fast it can operate .",
    "these feature makes ion inertial effect very important for the application to the protostellar discs .",
    "the modification to the magnetorotational instabilityby ion inertia may have wide ranging application in the astrophysical discs . before discussing the application of the results",
    ", we shall note that the parameters @xmath186 , @xmath221 and @xmath56 are not independent but are related by the following equation = ( ) , where @xmath250 is the normalized collision frequency and @xmath186 is the measure of non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "therefore , the choice of @xmath186 , @xmath56 and @xmath221 constrains the ratio @xmath251 and hence , the level of fractional ionization .    at densities relevant to cloud cores and protostellar discs ( densities @xmath252 ) ,",
    "grains are the dominant charge carriers and their presence can significantly alter the dynamics of the disc .",
    "the ionization fraction is strongly affected by the abundance and size distribution of the grains through the recombination process on the grain surface . near the midplane of the ppds grains",
    "are the main charged constituent @xcite .",
    "we shall assume a keplerian frequency for the minimum mass solar nebula ( @xmath253 ) , @xmath254 .",
    "then , from equations ( [ cf0 ] ) and ( [ cg ] ) we write ~10 ^ 14a_-5 ^ 2 ( ) . taking @xmath255",
    ", we see that @xmath14 is comparable to the dynamical frequency and ion - inertia becomes important .",
    "the collision of the energetic electron with neutrals or magnetorotational instabilityinduced turbulent convective homogenization of the entire disc @xcite may allow the magnetic field to couple to the disc matter near the mid plane .",
    "therefore , the ion - inertia may modify the parameter window of instability near the mid - plane of the disc .    in agns ,",
    "for example ngc 4258 , a thin disc of @xmath256 pc diameter , bound by a central mass of @xmath257 , is rotating with a velocity @xmath258 @xcite . the observed emission emanates from an annulus of inner radius @xmath259 pc and outer radius of @xmath260 pc . taking @xmath261 pc ,",
    "we get @xmath262 .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath263 .",
    "taking ionization fraction @xmath264 @xcite at @xmath265 , we see from equation ( [ rea ] ) that @xmath266 . the neutral density @xmath267 and",
    "thus , both ion - neutral @xmath14 as well as neutral - ion @xmath268 collision frequencies are very large in comparision with the rotation frequency .",
    "the charged grains are negligible in such a disk since from @xmath269 , we have @xmath270 for micron - sized grains",
    ". therefore , the charged grains are abesnt in such a disk and grain inertia will have no effect on the disc dynamics",
    ".    given the uncertain nature of the disc size , if we assume a disc of @xmath271 pc with a temperature gradient towards the outer edge of the disc then the inertial effects in such a disc will be due to the charged grains near the core of the disc and due to the lighter ions near the surface region of the disc . for @xmath272 ( at @xmath271 pc ) , @xmath273 , @xmath274",
    ", we see that in the surface region of an disc , both ion and neutral fluid will be affected by the magnetorotational instability .",
    "thus , ion - inertial effect may be important in exciting mhd turbulence in the whole disc .",
    "cataclysmic variables ( cv ) are close binary systems with a white dwarf accreting material from a roche - lobe and a companion low mass main sequence star .",
    "the typical orbital frequency of the cvs vary between @xmath275 . then @xmath276 . for @xmath277 , @xmath278 .",
    "the temperature in cvs may vary in a wide range and disc can be modeled either as a weakly ionized plasma @xcite or a completely ionized plasma @xcite . clearly , both ion and neutral inertial effect operate on an equal footing in cvs .",
    "the circumnuclear disc at the galactic centre has a typical constant rotation speed of @xmath279 km s@xmath280 ( @xcite ) between 2 to 4 pc .",
    "the corresponding rotational frequency at @xmath281 pc is , @xmath282 .",
    "then the ratio between ion - neutral collison to the keplerian roration frequency is ( 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 3 ) n_n , [ rcf ] for given @xmath14 value ( equation ( [ cf2 ] ) ) .",
    "hence at @xmath281 pc , the ion inertial response time , @xmath283 is thousand times slower than the collisional momentum exchange time , @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the ability of ion inertia to modify the magnetorotational instabilityat @xmath284 pc is unclear although @xmath285 for @xmath286 . at @xmath271 pc where @xmath0 drops by two orders ,",
    "@xmath14 becomes comparable to the rotational frequency and intertial effect on the magnetorotational instabilitymay become important .",
    "the paper examines the role of ion inertial effect on the magnetorotational instability in a weakly ionized , thin , magnetized keplerian disc .",
    "the vertical stratification and radial and azimuthal variations were neglected - an approximation valid for the wavelengths small compared to the disc scaleheight .",
    "the conductivity tensor becomes time dependent in the presence of ion inertial terms .",
    "this may result in the conductivity becoming negative near resonance .",
    "further , radial and azimuthal component of hall conductivity will be different .",
    "the following results were found .",
    "\\(i ) the conductivities in a weakly ionized gas is in general complex in the presence of ion inertia and may become negative near the resonance points .",
    "the magnetorotational instabilitygets significantly modified in the presence of time dependent conductivities .",
    "\\(ii ) in weak ambipolar regime , the presence of ion - inertial effect substantially modifies the behaviour of the instability in the non - ideal ( @xmath246 ) limit .",
    "the maximum growth rate in the hall dominated regime is @xmath287 ( in the units of @xmath0 ) and large wavelength fluctuations can grow due to the inertial effect .    for a fixed @xmath186 ,",
    "the growth rate is maximum ( @xmath288 ) for @xmath289 and starts to decrease with increasing @xmath221 .",
    "further , the parameter window shifts towards longer wavelength with increasing @xmath221 .",
    "\\(iii ) when both ambipolar and hall diffusion are comparable , the maximum growth rate is @xmath290 and @xmath291 for fixed @xmath221 and @xmath186 respectively .",
    "the increase in the ambipolar diffusion causes the fixed @xmath186 case to have larger growth rate than fixed @xmath221 case .    to summarize , it is a common feature that large scale fluctuations exhibit the maximum growth rate of the magnetorotational instabilitywhen the ion inertial effects are included in the dynamics .",
    "this may have important implication on the onset of turbulence in weakly ionized discs .",
    "for example , in ppds , when grains are dominant ions , the grain inertial effect will significantly modify the magnetorotational instabilitygrowth rate and thus , will play an important role in the onset of hydromagnetic turbulence . in agns also , grain will play important role . in cvs grain will provide the ion inertia away from the surface of the dwarf novae whereas , lighter ionized elements will provide the inertial effect close to the surface of the disc .",
    "therefore , in cv discs , inertial effect may be important all across the diak and inertia modified magnetorotational instabilitymay effect the whole disc . in circumnuclear discs ,",
    "the effect of ion inertia may be important far away from the centre of the disc .",
    "all in all , ion inertia seems to play an important role on the onset of magnetorotational instability .",
    "present work inevstigates the role of ion inertia in the presence of an axial magnetic magnetic field",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate the role of ion inertia on the magnetorotational instabilityfor a more general field geometry , particularly in the context of profile independent destabilizing feature of ambipolar diffusion @xcite .",
