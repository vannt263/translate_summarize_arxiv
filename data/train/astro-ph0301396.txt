    "the observed widths ( and profiles ) of emission lines , formed in stellar chromospheres , transition regions and coronae , provide valuable information on possible heating processes , in addition to that deduced from the emission line fluxes .",
    "observations of solar line widths in the ultraviolet ( uv ) part of the spectrum have been carried out since 1970 ( berger , bruner & stevens 1970 ; bruner et al . 1970 ) and much of the basic behaviour of these line widths was established from work in the 1970s using spectra obtained from rocket flights ( boland et al .",
    "1973 , 1975 ; kjeldseth - moe & nicolas 1977 ) and from the naval research laboratory s ( nrl ) spectrograph on _ skylab _ ( doschek et al . 1976 ; feldman et al .",
    "further work was carried out with instruments on _ orbiting solar observatory iv _",
    "( _ oso - iv _ ) and the _ solar maximum mission _ ( _ smm _ ) .",
    "these early observations showed that line broadening is present in excess of the thermal doppler width and that when interpreted in terms of a wave energy flux , this flux is essentially constant through the transition region from @xmath1  k to @xmath2  k ( where @xmath3 is the electron temperature ) . the observed line widths were found to be very similar in the various solar locations studied . using spectra obtained with the nrl s high resolution telescope and spectrograph ( hrts ) , kjeldseth - moe & nicolas ( 1977 ) found that some emission lines could not be well - fitted with a single gaussian profile , but have excess flux in a broad component .",
    "such profiles were studied further by dere & mason ( 1993 ) .",
    "the earliest instruments used photographic recording , which has some limitations , but the main results have been confirmed and extended using the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) instrument on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) .",
    "this has allowed line profiles to be studied with a combination of high sensitivity and high spatial and spectral resolution , at a variety of locations ( see e.g. doyle et al .",
    "1997 ; seely et al .",
    "1997 ; chae , schhle & lemaire 1998 ) .",
    "peter ( 2000a , b ; 2001 ) has made systematic measurements of line widths and shifts in both supergranulation cell boundary and cell interior regions .",
    "we make comparisons with the results of chae et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and peter ( 2000a , b ; 2001 ) in later sections of this paper .",
    "similar studies of line widths and line shifts were made for a few late - type stars observable at high resolution with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ) ( see e.g. ayres et al .",
    "1983a , b ; brown et al .",
    "1984 ; jordan et al . 1987 ) .",
    "significant improvements over these were obtained using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , and , most recently , using the greater spectral coverage and sensitivity of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "the observations with _",
    "iue _ showed the presence of line broadening in g / k - type dwarfs which is similar to that in the sun , and broader line widths in evolved stars with hot coronae .",
    "observations of dwarf and giant stars with the ghrs have shown the presence of excess flux in line wings , compared with single gaussian fits to the profiles ( linsky & wood 1994 ; wood , linsky & ayres 1997 , and references therein ) ; the contribution of this broad component appears to increase with indicators of stellar activity .",
    "the causes of the observed line broadening are not known , but several possible processes have been proposed .",
    "the excess width of the lines , compared with the thermal broadening , is commonly attributed to turbulence , and observed line profiles have been used to find the most - probable turbulent velocities or the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . ) velocities .",
    "these have been used to find non - thermal energy densities and the energy flux carried by the non - thermal motions , assuming that they are associated with the passage of waves through the atmosphere .",
    "( see e.g. brown et al .",
    "1984 ; jordan et al . 1987 ; wood et al . 1997 for stellar applications ) .",
    "when non - gaussian profiles have been observed , the excess flux in the wings has been attributed to a broad component associated with ` explosive events ' ( ` microflaring ' ) ( linsky & wood 1994 ) , or , in the sun , to the passage of alfvn waves ( peter 2001 ) .",
    "the effect of acoustic waves on line profiles has also been discussed ( bruner & mcwhirter 1979 ) .",
    "the possible origins of waves in the solar atmosphere and the processes by which these and other mechanisms , in particular magnetic reconnection , may cause heating of the solar chromosphere and corona have been the topic of many papers and reviews .",
    "we have made use of reviews by browning ( 1991 ) , narain & ulmschneider ( 1990 , 1996 ) and zirker ( 1993 ) .",
    "here we report observations of emission line profiles , widths and line shifts in the active dwarf @xmath0  eri ( k2  v ) .",
    "these have been made with the stis and with the instruments on the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "the data presented here are the most complete so far published for a main - sequence star , other than the sun .",
    "the new observations and data reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "analyses in terms of single gaussian fits to the line profiles and the implications of the line widths for the energy fluxes carried by alfvn waves and acoustic waves are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the results of the measurements of line shifts are given in section 4 .",
    "some of the line profiles are fitted better by 2-component profiles rather than single gaussian fits ; the widths and shifts derived for the two components and their possible interpretations are described in section 5 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the stis observations of @xmath0 eri have been described by jordan et al .",
    "( 2001a ) . the observations made with _",
    "fuse _ were obtained from the archive . in using the latter ,",
    "we restrict our analyses to the lines of cii and ovi , since these were obtained with the 1a lithium - fluoride detector , which is the one used to obtain the pointing on the star .",
    "the emission lines studied and the transitions involved are listed in table 1 , together with their rest wavelengths ( @xmath4 ) , observed wavelengths ( @xmath5 ) and line widths ( @xmath6 ) , which are the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the rest wavelengths are taken from kurucz and bell ( 1995 ) or from griesmann & kling ( 2000 ) , with the exception of that for the fe  xii line , which is based on the solar wavelength ( see jordan et al .",
    "the observed wavelengths and comparisons with the rest values given by the above authors and by kelly ( 1987 ) are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the widths given in table 1 were measured by making single - gaussian fits to the observed spectra . except at wavelengths above @xmath7   ,",
    "the background level is close to zero . at @xmath8  ",
    ", the background was determined from the nearby continuum .",
    "likely errors ( based on the wavelength resolution of the appropriate echelle grating , the uncertainty in the background level , the goodness of the fit and comparison with fluxes found by direct integration ) are given for each measurement .",
    "for some of the weakest lines the signal - to - noise ratio was judged to be too small to give reliable line widths .",
    "in addition to the gaussian fits , for the stronger lines , interactive measurements of the width at half the peak amplitude were made . for most of the lines these agree with the gaussian fit values , within the error bars , but for the resonance lines of civ , nv , ovi and siiv they are significantly smaller indicating that these profiles are not adequately described by a single gaussian fit .",
    "these half peak - amplitude widths are also given in table 1 .",
    "it is found that the profiles of these lines are described much better by two - gaussian fits ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the stis instrumental widths are taken from the stis www site , and are 1.1  2 pixels , depending on the wavelength and grating used . for the e140 m grating , one pixel is typically @xmath9   , and this instrumental broadening does not contribute significantly to the observed line widths . for",
    "the e230 m grating , one pixel is typically @xmath10   , which leads to significant contributions to the widths of longer wavelength lines observed with this grating ( see table 1 in jordan et al .",
    "the _ fuse _ observations have a resolution @xmath11 ( blair & andersson 2001 ) , corresponding to @xmath12   .    the effect of rotational broadening has been considered but is judged to be negligible . for @xmath0 eri , @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 ( saar & osten 1997 ) which is too small ( compared to the instrumental resolution ) to be detectable ; it is noted however , that only a factor of a few increase in the spectral resolution would make this detectable .",
    "the values of @xmath15 used in the calculations were chosen so that the width of the narrow gaussian fit component is comparable to that observed for c  iv . for the 2-d case @xmath16    and for the 1-d case @xmath17   .",
    "a1 and a2 show that these non - isotropic velocity distributions produce line profiles that have broader wings than a gaussian , in qualitative agreement with the observed profiles .",
    "the broad wings are relatively stronger in the 1-d than 2-d case .",
    "the width of the broad gaussian component fitted to the calculated profile is in very good agreement with that fitted to the observed c  iv profiles for the 1-d case , but is too narrow in the 2-d case .",
    "there is some quantitative disagreement between these calculations and the observations . in both cases , the flux ratio of the broad to narrow component is too large , compared with the observations .",
    "the 1-d flux ratio is consistent with the observed 1550-  flux ratio at the 2-@xmath18 level , but is very different from the 1548-  ratio .",
    "also , the computed profiles are symmetric about line centre while the observed broad components are all redshifted relative to the narrow components by several km  s@xmath14 . in the model used here ( which neglects the line formation process ) , to produce a redshifted broad component would require a mean net flow away from the observer . to shift the broad component relative to the narrow for the 1-d case would require a redshift that is largest in the regions with small @xmath19 , while for the 2-d case the redshift would need to be largest in regions with large @xmath19 .    in conclusion , it is apparent from figs .  a1 and a2 that a non - isotropic velocity distribution could predict line profiles with broad wings without the need to invoke a physically distinct second component to the emission .",
    "although the discussion here has used the passage of transverse and longitudinal waves as examples , it is noted that the results are general to any situation where the non - thermal velocities are confined to only one or two - dimensions , whatever their origin .",
    "it is not proposed that the extremely simple one and two - dimensional non - thermal velocity distributions used here are realistic ; we wish only to draw attention to the fact that such distributions can naturally lead to non - gaussian profiles whose properties are similar to those of observed transition region lines ."
