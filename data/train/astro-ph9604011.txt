    "the topic of gravitational lensing has a long history , as described for example in the first book entirely devoted to the subject ( schneider et al .",
    "the first known theoretical calculation of a light ray bending by massive objects was published by soldner ( 1801 ) , who used newtonian mechanics , and determined that the deflection angle at the solar limb should be @xmath1 , half the value calculated with the general theory of relativity ( einstein 1911 , 1916 ) .",
    "the first observational detection of this effect came soon afterwards ( dyson et al .",
    "zwicky ( 1937 ) pointed out that distant galaxies may act as gravitational lenses .",
    "almost all essential formulae used today to analyze gravitational lensing were derived by refsdal ( 1964 ) .",
    "the first case of a double image created by gravitational lensing of a distant source , the quasar 0957 + 561 , was discovered by walsh et al .",
    "( 1979 ) . arc  like images of extended sources , the galaxies , were first reliably reported by lynds & petrosian ( 1989 ) . in these three cases",
    "the sun , a galaxy , and a cluster of galaxies , were acting as gravitational lenses .",

    "a review of gravitational microlensing experiments has been published by ansari ( 1995 ) .",
    "the effect of double imaging of a distant source by a point mass located close to the line of sight , and acting as a gravitational lens , has been proposed many times over .",
    "chang and refsdal ( 1979 ) and gott ( 1981 ) noted that even though a point mass in a halo of a distant galaxy would create an unresolvable double image of a background quasar , the time variation of the combined brightness of the two images could be observed . this way the effect of non - luminous matter in a form of brown dwarfs or jupiters could be detected .",
    "the term `` microlensing '' was proposed by paczyski ( 1986a ) to describe gravitational lensing which can be detected by measuring the intensity variation of a macro  image made of any number of unresolved micro  images .",
    "paczyski ( 1986b ) suggested that a massive search of light variability among millions of stars in the large magellanic cloud could be used to detect dark matter in the galactic halo .",
    "luckily , the technology needed for such a search became available soon afterwards , and the 1986 paper is credited with triggering the current microlensing searches : eros ( aubourg et al .",

    "griest ( 1991 ) proposed that objects responsible for gravitational microlensing be called massive astrophysical compact halo objects ( macho ) .",
    "the name became very popular and it is commonly used to refer to all objects responsible for the observed microlensing events , no matter where they are located and what their mass may be .",

    "the line of sight intersects the deflector plane at point @xmath12 with coordinates : @xmath13 if there was no deflection of light by the massive object then the line of sight would intersect the source plane at point @xmath14 with coordinates : @xmath15 in fact the light ray passes the deflector at a distance @xmath16 ^{1/2 } .",

    "it is clear that the distance @xmath22 in the deflector plane is proportional to the distance between @xmath14 and @xmath4 in the source plane , and the latter can be calculated with the eqs .",

    "the appearance of a small circular source ( in the absence of lensing ) and its two distorted two images in a telescope with very high resolving power is shown in fig .",
    "2 . as any lensing conserves surface brightness ( cf . schneider et al .",
    "1992 , section 5.2 ) , the ratio of the image to source intensity is given by the ratio of their areas .",

    "2 this ratio can be calculated as @xmath32 assuming that the source is very small .",

    "the total magnification of the two images can be calculated as @xmath33 it is interesting to note that this is always larger than unity .",
    "it is also interesting that the difference in the magnification of the two images is constant : @xmath34    let us consider a typical galactic case , with a lens of @xmath35 mass at a distance of a few kiloparsecs , and the source at a larger distance .",

    "fortunately , all objects in the galaxy move , and we may expect a relative proper motion to be @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the relative transverse velocity of the lens with respect to the source . combining the last two equations we can calculate the characteristic time scale for a microlensing phenomenon as the time it takes the source to move with respect to the lens by one einstein ring radius : @xmath42 this definition is almost universally accepted , with one major exception : the macho collaboration multiplies the value of @xmath43 as given with the eq . ( 15 ) by a factor 2 .",
    "while the lens moves with respect to the source the two images change their position and brightness , as shown in fig .",
    "when the source is close to the lens the images are highly elongated and their proper motion is much higher than that of the source .",
    "note , that for each source position the two images , the source and the lens are all located on a straight line which rotates around the lens .",
    "unfortunately , none of this geometry can be observed directly for the stellar mass lenses , as the angular scale is of the order of a milli arcsecond .",
    "the total light variations can be observed , and the light curve can be calculated with the eq . ( 11 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath44 can be determined as @xmath45 ^{1/2 } , \\eqno(16)\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the dimensionless impact parameter : the smallest angular distance between the source and the lens measured in units of einstein ring radius , and @xmath47 is the time of the maximum magnification by the lens .",
    "the geometry of lensing for six values of impact parameter , and the corresponding time variability expressed in stellar magnitudes : @xmath48 , are shown in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "it is customary to define the cross section for gravitational microlensing to be equal to the area of the einstein circle .",
    "the combined magnification of the two images of a source located within that circle is larger than @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "11 ) i.e. it is easy to detect such intensity variation with a reasonably accurate photometry .",
    "let there be many lensing objects in the sky .",
    "the fraction of solid angle covered with their einstein rings is called the optical depth to gravitational microlensing .",
    "let all lensing objects have identical masses @xmath2 . in a thin slab at a distance @xmath3 and a thickness @xmath50 , there is , on average , one lens per surface area @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the average mass density due to lenses in the volume @xmath53 .",
    "each lens has a cross section @xmath54 , with the einstein ring radius @xmath26 given with the eqs .",
    "the slab contribution to the optical depth is given as @xmath55 \\delta d_d .",
    "\\eqno(18)\\ ] ] the total optical depth due to all lenses between the source and the observer can be calculated as @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "note that the optical depth @xmath58 depends on the total mass in all lenses , but it is independent of the masses of individual lenses , @xmath2 .",
    "if the density of matter is constant then we have @xmath59    if the system of lenses is self - gravitating , then a crude but very simple estimate of the optical depth can be made .",
    "let us suppose that the distance to the source @xmath5 is approximately equal to the size of of the whole system , a galaxy of lenses .",
    "the virial theorem provides a relation between the velocity dispersion @xmath60 , the density @xmath52 , and the size @xmath5 : @xmath61 combining eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) we obtain @xmath62 a more accurate estimate of the optical depth can be obtained by evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "( 19 ) for any distribution of mass density along the line of sight .",
    "we now proceed to the estimate of the number of microlensing events @xmath63 that may be expected if @xmath64 sources are monitored over a time interval @xmath65 . we consider only those microlensing events which have peak magnification in excess of @xmath66 , i.e. their dimensionless impact parameters are smaller than unity ( cf . figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we begin with the simplest case : all lensing objects have the same mass @xmath2 , and all have the same 3-dimensional velocity @xmath41 .",
    "we also assume that the velocity vectors have a random but isotropic distribution , the source located at the distance @xmath5 is stationary , and the number density of lensing objects is statistically uniform between the observer and the source .",
    "the time scale of a microlensing event is given as @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "15 ) where @xmath68 is the angle between the velocity vector and the line of sight , and @xmath69 is the transverse velocity of the lens . if all events had identical time scales , then the number of microlensing events expected in a time interval @xmath65 would be given as @xmath70 for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the ratio of einstein ring diameter to its area , in dimensionless units , and @xmath58 is the optical depth .",
    "in fact there is a broad distribution of event time scales as lenses ( all with the same mass @xmath2 and the same space velocity @xmath41 ) have transverse velocities in the range @xmath73 , and distances in the range @xmath74 .",
    "straightforward but tedious algebra leads to the equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the time scale for a microlensing event due to a lens located half way between the source and the observer , and moving with the transverse velocity @xmath41 .",
    "a detailed analysis is given by mao & paczyski ( 1996 ) .",
    "the probability distribution of event time scales is very broad .",
    "it can be shown to have power - law tails for very short and for very long time scales : @xmath77 @xmath78 note that the power law tails in the distribution of event time scales are generic to almost all lens distributions ever proposed .",
    "the very short events are due to lenses which are either very close to the source or very close to the observer , while the very long events are caused by the lenses which move almost along the line of sight . also note that only the first two moments of the distribution are finite ; the third and higher moments diverge .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to use a logarithmic probability distribution defined as @xmath79 as all moments of this distribution are finite .",
    "de rjula et al . ( 1991 ) proposed to use the moment analysis to deduce the distribution of lens masses .",
    "we shall carry on such an analysis , but first we have to make our model more realistic .",
    "as most astrophysical objects have a broad range of velocities , we adopt a 3-dimensional gaussian distribution : @xmath80 where the 3dimensional rms velocity @xmath81 is defined as @xmath82 we also adopt a general power law distribution of the number of lensing masses : @xmath83 or , in a logarithmic form : @xmath84 ~ m^ { \\alpha + 1 } ~ d \\log m , \\hskip 1.0 cm { \\rm for } \\hskip 0.5 cm \\alpha \\neq -1 , \\eqno(33)\\ ] ] @xmath85 ~ d \\log m , \\hskip 1.0 cm { \\rm for } \\hskip 0.5 cm \\alpha = -1 . \\eqno(34)\\ ] ] the case @xmath86 corresponds to equal total mass per decade of lens masses , i.e. each decade has the same contribution to the optical depth .",
    "the case @xmath87 corresponds to equal rate of microlensing events per decade of lens masses .",
    "if the mass function is very broad , i.e. @xmath88 , then the distribution of event rate will be flat in this case , with equal number of events per logarithmic interval of @xmath43 , with power law tails ( cf .",
    "27 and 28 ) .",
    "if @xmath89 then there is equal number of lenses per logarithmic interval of their masses .    a characteristic mass scale for the lenses can be related to the first moment of the @xmath43 distribution : @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "26 , 30 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath91 is indicative of the most common lens mass .",
    "however , for @xmath92 the mass spectrum is dominated by low mass objects , the event time scales have a small effective range , and the events are mostly due to lenses with @xmath93 . in the opposite case , with @xmath94 ,",
    "the microlensing events are dominated by lenses with @xmath95 .    for a given mass range",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath96 is the largest for @xmath87 , and it can be estimated analytically .",
    "first , imagine that there is a unique relation between the lens mass @xmath2 and the event time scale @xmath43 .",
    "the exponent @xmath87 implies a uniform distribution of event time scales in @xmath96 over the range @xmath97 , with @xmath98 . this distribution would have a standard deviation @xmath99",
    "however , there is no unique relation between the lens mass and the corresponding time scale @xmath43 in our model .",
    "even if all lenses had the same mass the standard deviation would be @xmath100 , according to numerical calculations .",
    "therefore , the following formula can be used to calculate the second moment : @xmath101 ^{1/2 } , \\hskip 0.5 cm \\sigma _ 0 = 0.268 , \\hskip 1.0 cm { \\rm for } \\hskip 0.5 cm \\alpha = -1.5 . \\eqno(36)\\ ] ]    there is another serious problem affecting the relation between the observed event time scales and the lens masses . in general",
    "we do not know which model should be adopted for the space distribution of lenses and for their kinematics . for the purpose of our exercise",
    "we adopted a uniform space density and a uniform velocity distribution , all the way from the source to the observer .",
    "unfortunately , there is no consensus yet on the distribution and the kinematics of the dominant lensing component towards the galactic bulge and towards the lmc . to reach a consensus it will be necessary to determine observationally the variation of optical depth to microlensing with the galactic coordinates , and to use this information to determine the space distribution of the dominant lens population .",
    "next , a model of the galactic gravitational potential will have to be used to estimate the kinematics of the dominant lens population . in order to have confidence that the observed distribution of event time scales",
    "is not truncated by instrumental effects the power law tails , like those given with the eqs .",
    "( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , will have to be well sampled .",
    "when all this work is done a relation between the distribution of event time scales and the distribution of lens masses will be sound .",
    "let us consider now a large number of point mass lenses , all located at the same distance @xmath3 , in front of a point source at @xmath5 .",
    "let a lens number `` i '' has a mass @xmath102 located at @xmath103 . a light ray crossing the deflector s plane at @xmath104 would pass at a distance @xmath105 from the lens `` i '' : @xmath106 ^{1/2 } ,   \\eqno(37)\\ ] ] ( cf .",
    "3 ) . the contribution to the light ray deflection by the mass `` i '' is given by the angle @xmath107 with the two components : @xmath108 ( cf . eqs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "as a result the combined deflection by all lensing masses the light ray will cross the source plane at @xmath109 : @xmath110 ( cf .",
    "note that @xmath111 and @xmath105 are all measured in the deflector plane , while @xmath112 and @xmath113 are measured in the source plane .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( 3840 ) we obtain @xmath114 @xmath115 where the angles are defined as @xmath116 and @xmath117 with dimensionless masses @xmath118 defined as @xmath119 the eqs .",
    "( 4142 ) may be written as @xmath120 @xmath121 all these are angles as seen by the observer .",
    "the set of equations ( 4647 ) can be used to find all images created by a planar lens system made of any number of point masses ( cf .",
    "witt 1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "here we shall restrict ourselves to a double lens case , as binary stars are known to be very common ( abt 1983 , mao & paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "a very thorough analysis of double star microlensing is provided by schneider & weiss ( 1986 ) . a major new phenomenon",
    "not present in a single lens case is the formation of caustics caused by the lens astigmatism .",
    "when a source crosses a caustic a new pair of images forms or disappears . a point source placed at a caustic is magnified by an infinite factor , while a source with a finite size is subject to a large , but finite magnification .",
    "a double lens is vastly more complicated than a single one .",
    "( 4647 ) applied to the binary case are : @xmath122 @xmath123 it is customary to adopt @xmath124 .",
    "this makes all the angles expressed in units of the einstein ring radius for a lens with a unit mass .",
    "if the binary orbital motion is neglected ( a ` static binary ' case ) then , in addition to all standard parameters describing single point mass lensing , there are three new dimensionless parameters : the mass ratio : @xmath125 , the binary separation in units of the einstein ring radius , and the angle between the source trajectory and the line joining the two components of the lens .",
    "the diversity of possible light curves is staggering .",
    "the first computer code that can not only generate theoretical light curves for a binary lens , but can also fit the best theoretical light curve to the actual data , was developed by mao & di stefano ( 1995 ) .",
    "it was applied to determine the parameters of two events which were almost certainly caused by double lenses : ogle # 7 ( udalski et al .",
    "1994d ) , and duo # 2 ( alard et al .",
    "1995b ) .",
    "a few examples of light curves generated by models of a double lens are shown in fig .",
    "6 , with the geometry of lensing indicated in fig .",
    "the model binary is composed of two identical point masses ( shown in fig . 7 with two large points ) : @xmath126 , with the separation equal to the einstein ring radius corresponding to @xmath2 , the total binary mass .",
    "the complicated closed figure drawn with a solid line is the caustic .",
    "when a source crosses the caustic then two images appear or disappear somewhere on the critical curve , shown with a dashed line .",
    "the critical line is defined as the location of all points in the lens plane which are mapped by the lensing onto the caustics which is located in the source plane .",
    "when the source is outside the caustic then three images are formed : one outside of the critical line , and two inside , usually very close to one of the two point masses . when the source is inside the region surrounded by the caustic then the additional two images are present , one inside and the other outside the region surrounded by the critical curve . in our example",
    "the five sources , marked with small open circles , have radii equal to 0.05 of the einstein ring radius .",
    "the five straight trajectories are also marked .",
    "the mass ratio of a double lens may be very extreme if one of the two components is a planet .",
    "mao & paczyski ( 1991 ) proposed that microlensing searches may lead to the discovery of the first extra  solar planetary system .",
    "that suggestion turned out to be incorrect as the first extra  solar system with 3 or even 4 planets has been discovered by other means ( wolszczan & frail 1992 , wolszczan 1994 ) .",
    "still , it is possible that numerous planetary systems will be detected with their microlensing effects .",
    "gould & loeb ( 1992 ) and bolatto & falco ( 1994 ) made some attempts to refine the probability of detection as estimated by mao & paczyski ( 1991 ) , but the real problem is setting up a practical detection system . here",
    "we shall consider just one aspect of the problem , with more discussion to follow in section 7 .",
    "although a search for jupiterlike objects might prove very interesting , the detection of earthlike planets would be far more exciting .",
    "in fact , such planets have been discovered around the radio pulsar psr b1257 + 12 by wolszczan & frail ( 1992 ) . until recently many searches for jupiter - mass planets yielded negative results , leading to the conclusion that `` ... the absence of detections is becoming statistically significant ... '' ( black 1995 ) .",
    "a recent discovery of a jupiter mass companion to a nearby star 51 pegasi by mayor and queloz ( 1995 ) , and the discovery of similar companions to the stars 70 vir and 47 uma by marcy & butler ( 1996 ) and by butler & marcy ( 1996 ) , respectively , demonstrate that such planets exist .",
    "if all stars had jupiters at a distance of a few astronomical units then a few percent of all microlensing events might show a measurable distortion of their light curves ( mao & paczyski 1991 , gould & loeb 1992 , bolatto & falco 1994 ) .",
    "if a small fraction of all stars has jupiters at such distances then the fraction of microlensing events which may be disturbed by giant planets is correspondingly reduced . according to butler & marcy ( 1996 ) @xmath127 5% of all stars have super - jupiter planets within 5 astronomical units .",
    "note , that the duration of the likely disturbance is of the order of @xmath128 day , i.e. very frequent observations are necessary in order not to miss them .",
    "the detection of earthlike planets is beyond the range of traditional techniques : radial velocity as well as astrometric measurements are not accurate enough , while pulsar timing is obviously not applicable to ordinary main sequence stars .",
    "it is interesting to check if earthlike planets are within reach for gravitational lensing searches .",
    "the earth mass is about @xmath129 , and a typical star is somewhat less massive than the sun .",
    "therefore , we consider now a very extreme mass ratio : @xmath130 .",
    "an isolated planetary mass object would create an einstein ring of its own , with the radius @xmath131 however , the same object placed close to a star , develops a complicated small scale magnification pattern superimposed on the large scale pattern generated by the star .",
    "it turns out that this effect is much more pronounced than a small disturbance which a planet may cause near the peak of the stellar magnification .",
    "an example of the planetary disturbances is shown in figure 8 , in which a very high magnification stellar microlensing event with the impact parameter equal to zero is disturbed by eight earthlike planets placed along the source trajectory . needless to say the disturbance caused by each planet is practically independent of the disturbances caused by all other planets .    naturally , this is a very artificial arrangement , but it makes it possible to present a variety of microlensing effects of earthlike planets in a single figure .",
    "the dimensionless time of a planetary disturbance @xmath132 is equal to the dimensionless position of the source @xmath133 , and both are related to the dimensionless location of the planet with the eq .",
    "( 8a ) : @xmath134 .",
    "the planets located close to the star , at @xmath135 , create local minima in the microlensing light curve presented in figure 8 ; they do this by reducing the brightness of the image corresponding to @xmath136 in figure 2 .",
    "the planets located farther away from the star , at @xmath137 create local maxima ( or double maxima ) in the microlensing light curve presented in figure 8 ; they do this by splitting the image corresponding to @xmath138 in figure 2 , and enhancing the combined brightness . if a planet is located close the einstein ring , i.e. if @xmath139 then it affects the peak of stellar microlensing light curve by disturbing one of the two images . while these disturbances are moderately large for jupiterlike planets ( mao & paczyski 1991 ) they turn out to be very small for earthlike planets . a detailed description and the explanation of these phenomena is provided by bennett & rhie ( 1996 ) .",
    "a close - up view of a single planetary event is presented in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "the two - dimensional magnification pattern is shown in figure 9 , together with the trajectories of three sources .",
    "the corresponding magnification variations are shown in figure 10 .",
    "this event corresponds to the magnification disturbance at @xmath140 in figure 8 , but the source trajectory is different in the two cases : it was along the x - axis in figure 8 , but it it is inclined to the x - axis at an angle @xmath141 in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "the planetary event lasts longer in figure 8 than in figure 10 because the region of high magnification is strongly stretched along the x - axis , as shown in figure 9 .",
    "this stretching enhances the cross section for planetary microlensing .",
    "the diversity of possible light curves is very large , just as it is in the case of a binary lens ( cf .",
    "figure 6 ) .",
    "figures 8 , 9 , and 10 presented in this section were prepared by dr .",
    "joachim wambsganss .",
    "i owe my insight into the diversity of planetary microlensing phenomena to dr .",
    "david bennett and dr .",
    "jordi miralda - escud .",
    "it is often claimed that gravitational microlensing of stars is achromatic , it does not repeat , and a symmetric light curve is described by a single dimensionless quantity : the ratio of the impact parameter to the einstein ring radius .",
    "while it is true that the above description is a good approximation to the majority of microlensing events , it is well established that none of these claims is strictly correct .",
    "stars are not distributed randomly in the sky , they are well known to be clustered on many scales .",
    "most stars are in binary systems , with the separations ranging from physical contact to 0.1 pc . many stars are in multiple systems .",
    "note that one of the brightest stars in the sky , castor , is a sixtuple system .",
    "this applies to the stars which are sources as well as to those which are lenses .",
    "the case of a double source is simple , as it generates a linear sum of two single lens light curves ( griest & hu 1992 ) .",
    "naturally , as the two stellar components may have different luminosities and colors the composite light curve may well be chromatic .",
    "if the two source stars are well separated and the lens trajectory is along the line joining the two , we may have a perception of two microlensing events separated by a few months or a few years , but both acting on apparently the same star , as images of the two binary components are unresolved .",
    "this would have the appearance of a recurrent microlensing event , and it may affect a few percent of all events ( di stefano & mao 1996 ) .",
    "a much more complicated light curve is generated by a double lens as described in the previous sub  section .",
    "note , that at least two types of double lensing events are expected . in the  resonant lensing ",
    "case , i.e. when the two point lenses of similar mass are separated by approximately one einstein ring radius , caustics are formed and dramatic light variations are expected , as in the case of ogle # 7 ( udalski et al .",
    "1994d ) and duo # 2 ( alard et al .",
    "1995b ) .",
    "as microlensing events are very rare , all current searches are done in very crowded fields in order to measure as many stars as possible in a single ccd frame .",
    "this means that the detection limit is set not by the photon statistics but by overlapping of images of very numerous faint stars .",
    "a typical seeing disk is about one arcsecond across , while the cross section for microlensing is about one milliarcsecond ( cf .",
    "therefore , an apparently single stellar image may typically be a blend of two or more stellar images which are separated by less then an arcsecond but by more than a milliarcsecond , i.e. only one of the two ( or more ) stars contributing to the blended image is subject to microlensing .",
    "this implies that when a theoretical light curve is fitted to the data it should always include a constant light term ( di stefano & esin 1995 ) .",
    "the contribution from a constant light was found in the double lenses ogle # 7 ( udalski et al . 1994d ) and duo # 2 ( alard et al . 1995b ) , and with at least one single lens ogle # 5 ( s. mao , private communication ) . as the various components to the",
    "apparently single stellar image may differ in color , a microlensing event of only one of them may appear as chromatic ( kamionkowski 1995 ) .",
    "of course , there should be a linear relation between the variable components in all color bands .",
    "no star is truly a point source .",
    "the finite extent of a star affects a microlensing light curve when the impact parameter of a single lens is smaller than the source diameter , and also when the source crosses a caustic of a double lens .",
    "this complicates the light curve by adding one more adjustable parameter .",
    "this effect , when measured , may be used to calculate the relative proper motion of the lens  source system ( gould 1994a ) .",
    "it may also be used to study the distribution of light across the stellar disk , the limb darkening , and the spots .",
    "so far we assumed that the relative motion between a lens and a source is a straight line .",
    "in fact the trajectory may be more complicated as the earth motion is accelerated by the sun , and in case of a double lens the two components orbit each other .",
    "this nonlinear motion of earth and of binary components makes a single lensing event asymmetric if its time scale is longer than a few months ( gould 1992 ) .",
    "a complicated double lens event becomes even more complicated .",
    "the most outstanding result of the current searches for microlensing events was the demonstration that they were successful . by the time",
    "this article is printed over 100 microlensing events will have been discovered , mostly by the macho collaboration , making this the most numerous class of gravitational lenses known to astronomers .",
    "just a few years ago , when the projects had been started , the scepticism about their success was almost universal , yet at least three teams , duo , macho , and ogle have numerous and believable candidate events .",
    "an example of a single microlensing event , ogle # 2 , is shown in fig .",
    "11 following udalski et al .",
    "the microlensing event took place in 1992 .",
    "this object was in the overlap area of two separate fields , so it had a large number of measurements    in the i  band : 93 , 187 , and 94 in the observing seasons 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 , respectively .",
    "the stellar luminosity was constant during these three years , with the average i band magnitude of 19.07 , 19.10 , and 19.13 , respectively ; the standard deviation of individual measurements was 0.13 , 0.10 , and 0.09 magnitude , respectively ( m. szymaski , private communication ) .",
    "the distribution of the ogle events in the @xmath142 color  magnitude diagram of the stars seen through baade s window , i.e. at @xmath143 , is shown in fig .",
    "note that the events are scattered over a broad area of the diagram populated by galactic bulge stars , in proportion to the local number density of stars multiplied by the local efficiency of event detection ( udalski et al .",
    "a very similar distribution for over 40 macho events detected towards the galactic bulge was shown by bennett et al .",
    "it is interesting that three out of @xmath144 macho events appear to be at the location which is occupied by the bulge horizontal branch stars as well as the disk main sequence stars , near @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "spectroscopic analysis should be able to resolve this ambiguity , i.e. are the lensed stars in the disk or in the bulge .",
    "the most dramatic result is the estimate by the macho collaboration that the optical depth to microlensing through the galactic halo is only @xmath147 ( based on 3 events ) , and can contribute no more than 20% of what would be needed to account for all dark matter in the halo ( alcock et al .",
    "the most surprising result is the ogle discovery that the optical depth is as high as @xmath148 ( based on 9 events ) towards the galactic bulge ( udalski et al .",
    "this result was found independently by macho with 4 events ( alcock et al .",
    "1995c ) , and qualitatively confirmed by duo ( alard 1996b ) .",
    "it should be remembered that all quantitative analyses of the optical depth as published to date are based on only @xmath149 events mentioned above .",
    "the statistics is improved with the recent preprint ( alcock et al .",
    "1995e ) with the analysis of 45 macho events detected in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "some nonstandard effects which had been first predicted theoretically were also discovered .",
    "these include very dramatic light curves caused by stellar sources crossing caustics created by double lenses ( ogle # 7 : udalski et al .",
    "1994d , bennett et al .",
    "1995 , duo # 2 : alard et al . 1995b , and probably one of the macho alert events : pratt et al .",

    "1995d ) as predicted by gould ( 1992 ) ; the light curve distortion of a very high magnification event by a finite source size ( alcock , private communication ) as predicted by gould ( 1994a ) , nemiroff & wickramasinghe ( 1994 ) , sahu ( 1994 ) , witt & mao ( 1994 ) , and witt ( 1995 ) ; the chromaticity of apparent microlensing caused by blending of many stellar sources , only one of them lensed ( stubbs 1995 , private communication ) as predicted by griest & hu ( 1992 ) .    the first theoretical papers with the estimates of optical depth towards the galactic bulge ( griest et al . 1991 , paczyski 1991 ) ignored the effect of microlensing by the galactic bulge stars .",
    "that effect was noticed to be dominant by kiraga & paczyski ( 1994 ) , who still ignored the fact that there is a bar in the inner region of our galaxy ( de vaucouleurs 1964 , blitz & spergel 1991 ) . finally , the ogle results forced upon us the reality of the bar ( udalski et al . 1994b , stanek et al . 1994 , paczyski et al .",
    "1994 , zhao et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "this `` re - discovery '' of the galactic bar by the microlensing searchers , who were effectively ignorant of its existence , demonstrates that the microlensing searches are becoming a useful new tool for studies of the galactic structure ( dwek et al .",
    "we are witnessing a healthy interplay between theory and observations in this very young branch of astrophysics .",
    "an example of a dramatic light curve of the first double microlensing event , the ogle # 7 , is shown in fig . 13 for 1992 and 1993 following udalski et al .",
    "( 1994d ) .",
    "this star was found to be constant in 1992 , 1994 , and 1995 .",
    "the average magnitude based on 32 , 45 , and 41 i - band measurements in these three observing seasons was 17.53 , 17.52 , and 17.54 , respectively , with the variance of single measurements being 0.07 , 0.04 , and 0.03 magnitudes , respectively ( m. szymaski , private communication ) .",
    "the objects was also found in the macho database ( bennett et al .",

    "it is hard to decide which was the first microlensing event , as this depends on what `` the first '' is supposed to mean .",
    "if we take the time at which a microlensing event reached its maximum , then the first was ogle # 10 which peaked on june 29 , 1992 ( udalski et al .",
    "it was followed by six other ogle events that were observed that summer .",
    "however , these were not uncovered until the spring of 1994 , when the automated computer searches finally caught - up with the backlog of unprocessed data .",
    "the ogle collaboration discovered its first event , ogle # 1 on september 22 , 1993 , but it peaked on june 15 , 1993 , almost a full year later than ogle # 10 .",
    "the first event to be ever noticed by a human was macho # 1  will sutherland saw it come out of a computer on sunday , september 12 , 1993 ( c. alcock , private communication ) .",
    "the first three papers officially announcing the first computer detections were published almost simultaneously by eros ( aubourg et al .",
    "1993 ) , by macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1993 ) , and by ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is likely that the two events reported by eros might have been due to intrinsic stellar variability rather than microlensing .",
    "eros # 1 has been recently found to be an emission line be type star ( beaulieu et al .",
    "the macho collaboration has identified a new class of variable stars , referred to as bumpers ( cook et al .",
    "1995 ) . these are be type stars , and it is possible that eros # 1 exhibited a bumper phenomenon .",
    "eros # 2 has been recently found to be an eclipsing binary , possibly with an accretion disk ( ansari et al .",
    "stars with accretion disks are known to exhibit diverse light variability , and the eros # 2 event might have been due to disk activity . in any case , the fact that both eros events were related to rare types of stars makes them highly suspect as candidates for gravitational microlensing .",
    "a total of about 100 gravitational microlensing events has been reported so far by the three collaborations : duo , macho , and ogle .",
    "the duo collaboration reported the detection of 13 microlensing events towards the galactic bulge , one of them double ( alard 1996b , alard et al .",
    "1995a , b ) .",
    "the macho collaboration reported at various conferences a total of about 8 events towards the lmc and about 60 events towards the galactic bulge , and has many more in the data that is still analyzed .",
    "the ogle collaboration has detected 18 events towards the galactic bulge , one of them double .",
    "in addition various collaborations confirmed events detected by the others .",
    "i am not aware of a single case in which there would be a discrepancy between the data obtained by various collaborations , though there is plenty of difference of opinion about some aspects of the interpretation .",

    "nevertheless , we may expect that robust determinations of the optical depth towards the galactic bulge and towards the lmc will be published in the very near future , as the data is already at hand .",
    "a major new development in the microlensing searches is the on line data processing .",
    "the ogle collaboration implemented its `` early warning system '' ( ews ) , a full on - line data processing system from the beginning of its third observing season , i.e. from april 1994 ( udalski et al .",
    "1994c ) . as a result",
    "all 8 ogle events detected in 1994 and 1995 were announced over internet in real time .",
    "the macho collaboration , with its vastly higher data rate , implemented the `` alert system '' with partial on - line data processing in the summer of 1994 ( stubbs et al .",
    "1995 ) , and full on - line processing by the beginning of 1995 ( pratt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the total number of events detected with the macho alert system as of october 15 , 1995 is about 40 , and all of them were announced over internet in real time .",
    "the first papers based on the follow  up of the real time announcements of microlensing events have already been published : szymaski et al .",
    "( 1994 ) presented the first light curve of the first event announced by the macho alert system .",

    "( 1995 ) presented the first spectra for the on  going microlensing event .",
    "the implementation of planet  probing lensing anomalies network ( albrow et al .",
    "1996 ) was a major development in 1995 .",
    "the aim of the project is to follow the announcements of real time detection of microlensing events ( currently implemented by the ogle and macho collaborations ) with frequent multi - color observations on four telescopes : the perth observatory 0.6 m telescope at bickley , australia , the 1 m telescope near hobart in tasmania , the south african astronomical observatory 1.0 m at sutherland , south africa , and the dutch - eso 0.92 m at la silla , chile .      in order to translate the observed rate of microlensing events into quantitative information about the optical depth and the lens masses",
    "it is necessary to calibrate the detection system .",
    "this is fairly straightforward , at least in principle , as all data processing is done with computers , with automated software .",
    "naturally , for the calibration to be possible every step of the detection process has to be done according to well defined rules , following the same algorithm for the duration of experiment .",
    "the calibration is done by introducing artificial microlensing events into the data stream and using the same algorithm to `` detect '' them as the one used for real detections .",
    "this process can be done at two very different levels : pixels or star catalogs .",
    "if the original data is collected with a ccd camera then from the beginning it is stored in a computer memory in a digital form . every ccd image obtained by ogle",
    "had @xmath150 pixels for a total of 8 megabytes of pixel data .",
    "every macho exposure generated 8 such ccd frames , 4 in each of two color bands , for a total of 64 megabytes . on a clear night between 30 and 100",
    "exposures may be taken .",
    "the ogle collaboration was given @xmath151 nights on the swope 1 meter telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile ( operated by carnegie institution of washington ) for each of the four observing season : 199295 , and generated @xmath152 gb of data every year .",
    "the macho collaboration refurbished a dedicated 1.3 meter telescope at the mount stromlo observatory in australia .",
    "their observations began in mid-1992 , but the routine operation started in january 1993 .",
    "currently , the macho collaboration obtains @xmath153 gb of data every year .",
    "if the original data is obtained with photographic plates , as it was done for the main part of the eros project and the whole duo project , then the plates have to be scanned and digitized before the data can be stored in a computer memory .",
    "a single schmidt plate has @xmath154 pixels for a total of @xmath155 gb of data .",
    "once the data is available in a form of digital pixel images a dedicated software is used to measure the location and the brightness of stellar images . the macho and ogle collaborations modified dophot ( schechter et al . 1993 ) to make it faster ( udalski et al .",
    "1992 , bennett et al .",
    "the coordinates of stellar images were determined on good ccd frames which were chosen to be the templates .",
    "all other frames were first shifted to coincide with the templates using a few bright stars , and the coordinates of all other stars were adopted from the template .",
    "next , the brightness of all template stars was measured on all frames .",
    "this speeded the data processing by a large factor , but restricted photometry to those stars which were found on the templates .",
    "also , this procedure makes it impossible to detect proper motions . using a modified dophot software up to",
    "@xmath156 stars could be measured on a ccd frame with @xmath157 pixels , which corresponds to the effective number of @xmath152 pixels per star .",
    "the duo software ( alard 1996b , alard et al .",
    "1995a ) measured not only the brightness but also the position of every stellar image on every digitized schmidt plate , for a total of @xmath158 stars per plate , i.e. @xmath159 pixels per star .",
    "the results of stellar photometry are combined into a database of photometric measurements which is searched for microlensing events .",
    "very stringent criteria have to be used for detection because the events are very rare .",
    "for example , one of the ogle conditions was the requirements that at least 5 consecutive measurements of the candidate object had to be brighter than normal , well measured brightness of the star , by more than three standard deviations ( udalski et al .",
    "this conservative approach was necessary in order not to be swamped with fictitious `` events '' , but it made the efficiency of the detection rather low .",
    "let @xmath63 be the total number of photometric measurements of all stars , @xmath64 the number of microlensing events detected in the database , and @xmath58 be the optical depth to microlensing as estimated on the basis of these detections . using the published macho and ogle results",
    "one finds that @xmath160 .",
    "this implies that the effective number of photometric measurement needed for a detection of a single event was @xmath161 .",
    "the first catalog level estimate of the efficiency of microlensing detections was published by the ogle collaboration ( udalski et al .",
    "it was done introducing artificial microlensing events into the database of photometric measurements and following exactly the same criteria for detection as the criteria used in the original search .",
    "it turned out that the efficiency was approximately constant for events in the time scale range 30 days @xmath162 100 days , but it dropped rapidly towards shorter time scales : down by a factor 10 at @xmath163 days and a factor 100 at @xmath164 day .",
    "very similar results were found by the macho collaboration with a much more thorough `` pixel level '' calibration ( alcock et al .",
    "1995a ) . in that case",
    "the artificial events are added as artificial stars to the images obtained with the ccd detector .",
    "this means that the effect of blending of stellar images is automatically taken into account .",
    "the pixel level calibration is the correct way to proceed , but it is much more time consuming than the catalog level calibration .",
    "fortunately , the results are the same to within @xmath165 as the two opposite effects nearly cancel out : stellar blending means that there are really more stars that may be subject to microlensing , and this increases the number of events per stellar image . on the other hand",
    "the apparent brightening is reduced making some events impossible to detect .",
    "note , that as long as the procedure used for the detection of artificial events is exactly the same as the procedure used for the original search , the estimate of the event rate and the optical depth is not influenced in a systematic way by the specific criteria . naturally , if the criteria are too stringent then there are fewer detections ( in the real data as well as in the simulations ) , and the random errors of the estimated values increase . if the criteria are too lax then in addition to genuine microlensing events a number of intrinsically variable stars , or even artifacts of the detector system , may enter the sample , introducing uncontrollable systematic errors .",
    "as far as i know we have no quantitative procedure to define the optimum criteria at this time .",
    "the fact that the current detection systems are sensitive to events over limited range of time scales implies that the estimates of the optical depth and/or the event rates can only provide the lower limits .",
    "as the duration of searches increases so does their sensitivity to ever longer events .",
    "it will take a different observing procedure to improve the sensitivity to very short events .",
    "most searches done so far made only 1 or 2 photometric measurements per star per clear night .",
    "the only ccd search with up to 46 photometric measurements per star per clear night was done by the eros collaboration , and the null result was reported by aubourg et al .",

    "there is a consensus now about a number of important issues related to microlensing in our galaxy and near our galaxy .",
    "the most important is the consensus that the microlensing phenomenon has been detected .",
    "it is not possible to tell at this time what fraction of so called `` candidate events '' is real , and what fraction is due to poorly known types of stellar variability .",
    "my personal guess is that the contamination fraction is probably below 10% , or so .",
    "my arguments in favor of microlensing as the dominant source of the newly detected variability are the following :    1 .",

    "these include @xmath171 pulsating stars of the rr lyrae type ab in the galactic bulge , and @xmath172 such stars in the sagittarius dwarf , considerably extending the known size of that galaxy , and clearly demonstrating the usefulness of variable stars as tracers .",
    "perhaps the most important serendipity result is the discovery by kauny et al .",
    "( 1995b ) of the first detached eclipsing binaries at the main sequence turn  off point of the globular cluster omega centauri .",
    "the follow  up spectroscopic observations will determine , for the first time , the masses of stars at the globular cluster main sequence turn ",
    "off point , and hence will provide a sound basis for the reliable age and helium content determinations .",
    "the point is that while the theoretical color  magnitude diagrams are affected by our lack of understanding of the mixing length theory , the mass  luminosity relation is insensitive to large changes of the mixing length ( paczyski 1984 ) .",
    "the same detached binaries will allow very accurate determination of distances to globular clusters , while the follow  up spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binaries discovered by the eros collaboration ( grison et al . 1995 ) will provide a very accurate distance to the lmc ( paczyski 1996 ) .",
    "we may expect that in the near future detached eclipsing binaries will provide accurate distances to all galaxies of the local group ( hilditch 1995 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that in order to discover a detached eclipsing binary one needs a few hundred photometric measurements .",
    "only one out of a few thousand stars is of this type , with deep and narrow primary and secondary eclipses , and no anomalies in the light curve .",
    "this implies one needs @xmath173 photometric measurements to detect one good system .",
    "this is a lot of work , but it will lead to the determination of accurate ages of globular clusters , their helium content , and the hubble constant , some of the most important numbers for cosmology .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams obtained in the standard ( v , i ) photometric system by the ogle collaboration for the galactic bulge region show evidence for the galactic bar ( stanek et al .",
    "they also indicate that the galactic disk has a low number density of luminous ( i.e. massive and young ) as well as faint ( i.e. low mass and old ) main sequence stars in the inner @xmath174 kpc ( paczyski et al .",
    "1994 ) , which seems to be consistent with the presence of the strong bar .",
    "the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams obtained for the recently discovered sagittarius dwarf allowed mateo et al .",
    "( 1995a ) to determine the distance of @xmath175 kpc to this galaxy , and to estimate its age and metallicity to be 10 gy and [ fe / h ] @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "alard ( 1996a ) and mateo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found a large extension of this galaxy by discovering in it a large number of rr lyrae variables , a by product of massive photometry carried out by duo and ogle .",
    "the near future of the microlensing searches is easy to predict : more of the same , or rather very much more of the same .",
    "while the macho collaboration has streamlined its data processing and does it in real time , the eros and ogle collaborations are building in chile their 1-meter class telescopes to be dedicated to massive microlensing searches .",
    "many other groups are either planning or developing new detection systems .",
    "in particular , a few groups intend to monitor m31 ( crotts 1992 , ansari et al . 1995b = agape = andromeda galaxy and amplified pixels experiment ) .",
    "it is not known how many stars can be monitored from the ground in the direction of the galactic bulge and all members of the local group galaxies , but a fair estimate is @xmath177 , i.e. about one order of magnitude more than the current @xmath178 of the macho collaboration .",
    "note , that stars towards the galactic bulge and towards the lmc and smc are bright , and even with a 1-meter class telescope the detection limit is set by the crowding of stellar images , not by the sky or the photon statistics .",
    "therefore , the better the seeing the more stars can be detected and accurately measured .",
    "it is easily imaginable that within a few years the detection rate will increase to @xmath172 events per year towards the galactic bulge and @xmath179 events per year towards the lmc and smc . with @xmath180 events detected towards the bulge , and @xmath181 towards the lmc and smc",
    "it will be easy to map the distribution .",
    "the observed distribution of lensing events in the sky will soon reveal the space distribution of the lenses towards the galactic bulge ( cf .",
    "evans 1994 , kiraga 1994 ) .",
    "a rapid increase of the optical depth towards the center will indicate that the lenses are located predominantly in the bulge of our galaxy . a more or less uniform optical depth will point to the galactic disk as the dominant site of the lensing objects .",
    "the task will be more difficult in the case of lmc . the observed rate is low , and it will take longer to accumulate good statistics .",
    "a rapid increase of the optical depth towards the center will indicate that the lenses are located predominantly in the bulge of lmc .",
    "a more or less uniform optical depth would be more difficult to interpret , as such a result would be compatible with the lenses located either in the galactic disk or in the galactic halo .",
    "it may be necessary to measure the optical depth in as many directions as possible , towards all members of the local group of galaxies .",
    "this is a difficult task as these are far away , and hence their stars are very faint .",
    "it is likely that 2 - 4 meter class telescopes will be required for the observations ( crotts 1992 , colley 1995 , ansari et al .",
    "1995b ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the statistics of microlensing of the galactic bulge red clump stars will allow the determination of the geometrical depth of the bulge / bar system ( stanek 1995 ) .",
    "the lensed objects will be found predominantly among the stars located on the far side .",
    "therefore , these stars will appear to be fainter , at least on average , than typical red clump stars .",
    "it is likely that within a few years the range of event time scales between 1 hour and 3 years will be very well sampled . with the observed distribution of event time",
    "scale known over this whole range , or with stringent upper limits available for some part of the range , it will become meaningful to translate this distribution into the mass function of the lensing events .",
    "the necessary pre - requisite will be the knowledge of the space distribution and kinematics of the lenses .",
    "it seems safe to expect that the space distribution will be revealed through the variation of the optical depth over the sky , while the kinematics will follow from the improved understanding of the galactic structure",
    ". this analysis will not be good enough to know the mass of any particular lens to better than a factor 2 or 3 , but it is likely that the overall range of masses will be known with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "there are very many papers and preprints written about the possible distribution of mass within the dark halo , or within the galactic disk , as well as on the possible nature of the lensing objects ( those include gas clouds and axion miniclusters ) .",
    "these will not be reviewed here , as i consider them too speculative .",
    "a more direct analysis of the data will provide the answers to most interesting current questions in a matter of a few years .",
    "it is virtually certain that the expansion of microlensing searches will be followed with the expansion of the follow - up observations .",
    "there is a very natural division of labor in this area as well as in the area of supernovae searches . in order to discover very rare events",
    "one needs detectors with as many pixels as possible .",
    "the multi  band coverage is not essential .",
    "the pixels are expensive and difficult to purchase , and it is practically not possible to fill the whole field of view of a modern 1-meter class telescope with ccds , as the field may be 1.5  5 degrees across . given a limited number of pixels we have to decide what is more efficient : to put them all in one plane , making the search area as large as affordable , or to cover only 50% of the area in two bands ?",
    "note that every detection system is most sensitive in a particular band .",
    "for example the ogle system can record more stellar images in i - band than in v  band in a fixed exposure time .",
    "also , when the moon is bright the sky intensity in the i band is smaller than it is in the v band .",
    "thin ccd chips are currently so expensive that extending the search to the b and u bands is not possible within a realistic budget . the implementation of real  time data analysis , coupled to the distribution of information over the internet , and the availability of follow - up systems like planet ( albrow et al . 1996 ) makes the multi - band search unnecessary .    on the other hand",
    "it is most essential for the follow - up observations to be as multi - band and as frequent as possible . as only a relatively small number of pixels",
    "is needed for the follow - up it should be possible to use thin ccd chips for this purpose .",
    "a frequent time coverage is most essential as many interesting phenomena happen on the time scale on which a star moves across its own diameter , which takes a few hours .",
    "such source resolving events may allow the measurement of the relative proper motion in the lens  source system ( gould 1994a ) , as well as to study the structure of stellar photospheres .",
    "they may also lead to the detection of planets around stars ( mao & paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "a dramatic improvement in the data processing software may be expected when the current photometry of stellar images is supplemented with a search for variable point sources using digital image subtraction , also known as `` ccd frame subtraction '' .",
    "the image subtraction is very elegant , and its principles are very simple , as described and implemented by ciardullo et al .",
    "imagine that we have two images of the same area in the sky taken under identical seeing conditions , and the same atmospheric extinction .",
    "every point source has an image spread over many pixels according to the point spread function , psf .",
    "when the two images are subtracted from each other there should be no residuals if nothing has changed .",
    "if some stars changed their brightness then there should be some residuals , positive or negative , with the profile defined by the psf .",
    "these residuals can be measured , and so the stellar variability can be detected .",
    "if we do not care about stars that remain constant then this is by far the most efficient way to proceed .",
    "also , this method may allow the detection of variables which are too crowded to measure the non  variable component of their light due to the constant contaminating stars .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to implement the image subtraction technique , as there are many practical problems as described by ciardullo et al .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to expect that the proof of its practical usefulness should be provided by the determination of light curves of periodical variables , like pulsating or eclipsing stars .",
    "it is much easier to detect a periodic signal , and to confirm its reality , than to detect convincingly a non  periodic and non repeating signal , like a microlensing event .",
    "however , the recently published efforts ( crotts 1992 , baillon et al . 1993 , ansari et al .",
    "1995b , gould , 1995b , 1996 ) seem to concentrate on the detection of non  periodic signals , referred to as  pixel lensing  .",
    "any discussion of a distant future is obviously speculative , but it is also entertaining . a rather obvious idea is to observe microlensing with space instruments .",
    "the natural reasons include stable weather , perfect seeing , and access to the uv and ir .",
    "however , there are special advantages for microlensing in putting an instrument at a distance of @xmath128 au from the ground based telescopes , as this would allow to detect the microlensing parallax effect as pointed out by refsdal ( 1966 ) and by gould ( 1994b , 1995a ) .",
    "any observations done at a single site provide only one quantity which has physical significance : the time scale @xmath43 .",
    "unfortunately , this time scale is a function of the lens mass , its distance , and its transverse velocity ( cf . eq .",
    "15 ) , none of which is known .",
    "however , the illumination pattern created by the lens varies substantially on a scale of a fraction of the einstein ring radius , or its projection onto the observer s plane .",
    "hence , even a small space telescope placed at a solar orbit would reveal a different light curve of the lens , and provide this way some additional information about the lens properties .",
    "unfortunately , this will not be sufficient to solve for all three unknowns .",
    "however , if the same event happens to resolve the source then the relative proper motion of the lens  source system can be determined ( gould 1994a ) , and perhaps a complete solution could be obtained . in particular , the determination of the lens mass might be possible .",
    "there are some problems with this idea .",
    "one of them is the high cost , likely to be of the order of @xmath182 , as compared with @xmath183 for a typical ground based microlensing search ( though supposedly `` dollars in space weigh less '' ) .",
    "also , even though the parallax effect alone can provide some constraint on the lens , it can not provide a unique determination of the lens mass , with a possible exception of some special cases , like the very high magnification events during which the source is resolved .",
    "unfortunately , such events are very rare .",
    "perhaps the single most dramatic impact of the space measurements would be a direct proof that a particular event is indeed caused by gravitational microlensing as no other phenomenon can be responsible for the difference in the observed light curves .    many of the problems , including a decent statistical determination of the lens masses ,",
    "will be solved in the near future with the ground based observations . when the optical depth to the galactic bulge is mapped with @xmath184 lensing events then the space distribution of the lenses ( galactic disk versus galactic bulge / bar )",
    "will be definitely understood .",
    "as the kinematics of the disk and the bulge / bar stars can be directly observed an adequate model for the lens statistics will be developed as a refinement of the approach outlined in the section 3 .",
    "any particular lens is not likely to have its mass determined to better than a factor @xmath185 or so , but the average mass , and perhaps the mass range and the slope of the mass function will be deduced .",
    "this task will be relatively easy for the lenses observed towards the galactic bulge because of their high rate .",
    "it will take much more time to obtain equally reliable information about the lenses observed at high galactic latitudes because of their very low rate . yet",
    ", continuous monitoring of the stars in all local group galaxies will provide the basis for the determination of the lens distribution and masses in a matter of a decade or so .",
    "this is basically the matter of detecting enough events to map the variation of the optical depth over the sky .",
    "there are at least two cases in which the masses of individual lenses can be measured with no ambiguity .",
    "these are lenses belonging to globular clusters seen against the rich stellar background of the galactic bulge or lmc / smc ( paczyski 1994 ) , and the nearby high proper motion stars seen against the distant stars of the milky way or lmc / smc ( paczyski 1995a ) . in both cases the distances and proper motions of the lenses can be measured directly , or indirectly ( the lenses in the globular clusters will be too dim to see them ) , and the lens mass remains the only unknown quantity on the right hand side of the eq . (",
    "15 ) .",
    "the range of lens masses which can give rise to observable lensing events is very broad . at the low end",
    "the practical limit is imposed by the finite size of the sources .",
    "the amplification of a point source which is perfectly aligned with a lens is infinite ( cf .",
    "eq . 11 with @xmath186 ) . however , when a source with a finite angular radius @xmath187 is perfectly aligned , then its circular disk forms a ring  like image , which has its inner and outer radius , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , given with a slightly modified eq .",
    "( 9 ) : @xmath190 , \\hskip 2.0 cm r_{out } = \\left [ \\left ( r_{_e}^2 + 0.25 r_s^2 \\right ) ^{1/2 } + 0.5 r_s \\right ] , \\eqno(50)\\ ] ] where all quantities are expressed as angles .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , a uniform surface brightness of the source the maximum magnification can be calculated as the ratio of the two areas : @xmath191 ^{1/2}.   \\eqno(51)\\ ] ] for the event to be reasonably easy to detect we choose @xmath192 , which is equivalent to condition : @xmath193 .    an angular radius of a star",
    "is given as @xmath194 this may be combined with the eq .",
    "( 13 ) to obtain @xmath195 the smallest mass for which the einstein ring radius is no less than half the source radius is given as @xmath196    if the source is in the galactic bulge , at @xmath197 kpc , and the lens at @xmath198 kpc ( zhao et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) , then condition ( 54 ) becomes : @xmath199 if the source is in the lmc at @xmath200 kpc , and the lens is in the galactic halo at @xmath201 kpc then the condition ( 54 ) becomes : @xmath202 note that the scaling factor for the source radius is @xmath203 in the eq .",
    "( 56 ) , while it is @xmath204 in the eq .",
    "( 55 ) to allow for the fact that the distance to the lmc is about 7 times larger than to the galactic center , and the source stars near the detection limit are correspondingly larger . the time scale of a microlensing event caused by lenses at the lower mass limit can be calculated combining the eqs .",
    "( 15 ) , ( 53 ) and ( 54 ) to obtain : @xmath205    the estimate of @xmath206 implies that it should be possible to extend the searches down to masses as small as that of our moon",
    ". these objects may be planets lensing together with their parent stars , as described in section 4 , or these may be planetary mass objects roaming the interstellar space , rather than orbiting any star . clearly , the task of finding them will be very difficult unless they are very numerous .",
    "let us make a modest assumption that every star has just one earth mass planet , and a typical mass of the lenses actually responsible for the events detected towards the bulge and the lmc is @xmath207 .",
    "this implies that the mass ratio is @xmath208 , and hence the optical depth to microlensing by those planets is @xmath209 towards the galactic bulge and @xmath210 towards the lmc",
    ". these numbers may be somewhat larger as the cross section for planetary microlensing is enhanced by the presence of a nearby star ( cf .",
    "figure 9 ) .",
    "it is clear that the searches aiming at finding such planets must be vastly more thorough than anything operating now .",
    "let us make a crude estimate of the most sensitive ground based search for microlensing that could be done by simply making multiple copies of the existing systems .",
    "let all stars that may be microlensed , perhaps @xmath211 of them , be measured every few minutes to detect all events with a time scale @xmath212 minutes .",
    "let there be @xmath213 hours of clear observing per year combining all ground based sites .",
    "this translates into six events per year with @xmath214 hour if the optical depth is @xmath215 .",
    "the good news is that there are enough stars in the sky to detect a moderately large number of planetary microlensing events with the 1meter class ground based telescopes if a mega  project is carried out for a few years .",
    "the bad news is that the required data rate would be about 1000 times larger than the current macho rate .",
    "the price tag would certainly be very impressive , but probably not in excess of a single space mission .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that with a rather immodest increase of current microlensing searches the dark objects down to asteroid mass range could be detected even if their fractional contribution to the galactic mass was as small as @xmath208 .",
    "it is also possible , at least in principle , to extend the search to masses as large as @xmath216 .",
    "the events due to lenses that massive have a duration of @xmath0 years , yet they may be detected , at least in principle , with two very different methods .",
    "first , a parallax effect due to earth orbital motion will introduce @xmath217 modulation in the light curve , with a period of one year ( gould 1992 ) .",
    "second , very numerous stars which are normally below the detection threshold will be occasionally microlensed by a very large factor . according to the eq .",
    "( 11 ) the highly magnified source is within factor of 2 of its peak brightness for a time interval @xmath218 , which may be reasonably short for @xmath219 ( paczyski 1995b ) .",
    "so , either of the two methods may allow the extension of the microlensing searches to the range of supermassive machos .",

    "<S> the status of searches for gravitational microlensing events of the stars in our galaxy and in other galaxies of the local group , the interpretation of the results , some theory , and prospects for the future are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> the searches have already unveiled @xmath0 events , at least two of them caused by binaries , and have already proven to be useful for studies of the galactic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the events detected so far are probably attributable to the effects of ordinary stars , and possibly to sub - stellar brown dwarfs ; however a firm conclusion can not be reached yet because the analysis published to date is based on a total of only 16 events . </S>",
    "<S> the current searches , soon to be upgraded , will probably allow determination of the mass function of stars and brown dwarfs in the next few years ; these efforts will also provide good statistical information about binary systems , in particular their mass ratios . </S>",
    "<S> they may also reveal the nature of dark matter and allow us to detect planets and planetary mass objects . </S>"
