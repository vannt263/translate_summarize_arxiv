    "the lhc experiments have successfully discovered the last missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) - the elusive higgs boson . however",
    "no sign of any physics beyond the sm has been observed yet .",
    "although the standard model has been extremely effective , many unsolved questions still remain .",
    "the left - right ( l - r ) symmetric models @xcite provide appealing solutions for some of these questions .",
    "firstly it explains the origin of the parity violation at the weak scale . in l - r models",
    ", parity is an exact symmetry of the weak - interaction lagrangian at an energy scale much higher than the sm scale .",
    "the parity violation arises from the spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by a vacuum not being invariant under parity .",
    "secondly , the l - r models predicts the existence of right handed neutrinos that explain the light neutrino mass via the see - saw mechanism .",
    "finally these models place quarks and leptons on the same footing in the weak interactions and provide a simple formula for the electric charge , involving only the weak isospin and the difference between the baryon and lepton numbers ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the lhc signature of these l - r models by focusing on the like - sign leptons from the decays of the left - handed doubly charged scalars ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here , that the doubly charged higgs particles may also arise in other models , such as , georgi - machacek model @xcite , littlest higgs model @xcite and 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite .",
    "recent publications @xcite have studied the doubly charged higgs belonging to different multiplets .",
    "a rather interesting work  @xcite has investigated lepton number violating decays of heavy flavor fermions ( @xmath7 ) induced by the doubly charged higgs .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the production of doubly charged higgs boson has been considered using drell - yan ( dy ) mechanism in the scope of the models described above . in this paper",
    ", we consider the production of a pair of doubly charged higgs boson accompanied by two energetic tagging jets , predominantly produced by vector boson fusion ( vbf ) processes , where the leading jets are very helpful to reduce the background . in various different contexts",
    "the single production of a doubly charged higgs boson through @xmath8 fusion at the lhc , have been discussed in some earlier studies@xcite . in these studies the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the triplet sector is assumed to be non - zero and consequently the final states with @xmath8 are considered using the decay modes of @xmath9 containing @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "however we differ from these searches in the sense that , we have only considered the scenario where the left triplet vev of l - r symmetric models are zero , to avoid unnatural experimental consequences .",
    "in such a scenario , we will consider e , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( hadronic ) final states arising from the doubly charged higgs decays directly along with two high @xmath1 jets . by using vbf topological cuts ,",
    "we shall offer a search strategy of the doubly charged higgs boson at the lhc , complementary to the current search being performed by cms @xcite and atlas @xcite for multilepton final states without using two tagged jets .",
    "the potential discovery of @xmath13 in both vbf and dy channel can be instrumental in determining the electroweak ( ew ) origin of it .",
    "the paper is orgainized as follows : section  [ l - r model ] briefly reviews the l - r symmetric model .",
    "section  [ pheno ] discusses the production mechanism and the subsequent decay of the doubly charged higgs .",
    "the results for future lhc searches are given in section  [ results ] .",
    "finally the conclusions drawn from the study have been summarized in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "here we present a brief overview of the @xmath14 l - r symmetric models  @xcite .",
    "the scalar sector of these models consist of the following higgs multiplets  @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17    the higgs mutiplets transform according to @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the scalar field potential involving the interactions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 involves numerous parameters .",
    "for reader s convenience , we included the higgs potenial we have used for our study in appendix  [ a ] .",
    "following the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite we define , @xmath23 the vev of the bidoublet @xmath20 and triplets @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 @xmath26 while the bidoublet @xmath20 breaks the sm symmetry @xmath27 , the @xmath28 is broken by the triplet vevs @xmath29 and consequently provides a majorana mass to the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the parameters in the scalar field potential can be severely constrained by various experimental observations . from the @xmath30 mixing , @xmath31 is constrained to be very heavy ( @xmath32 tev )  @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariance of @xmath33 requires the coupling of @xmath31 to both @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "consequently @xmath34 depends on @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with both @xmath38 at the electro - weak ( ew ) scale .",
    "thus @xmath35 needs to be large ( @xmath39 ) . for the simplicity of calculation we set @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus after fixing @xmath42 and @xmath43 , there are two options for the left - handed vev , @xmath44 : ( i ) @xmath45 or ( ii ) @xmath46 .",
    "however @xmath44 is highly constrained to be @xmath47 by the @xmath0 parameter , where @xmath48 . for @xmath41 , the @xmath0",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath49 from the experimentally observed value  @xcite @xmath50 ( at 2@xmath51 ) , we obtain a bound @xmath52 gev , which is very small compared to @xmath53 246 gev .",
    "now let us take a more detailed look at each left - handed vev scenario .",
    "the minimization condition of the higgs potential in this case sets @xmath54 .",
    "thus from the mass spectrum of the left higgs triplet , presented in appendix [ a ] , we obtain at the tree level , @xmath55    for @xmath56 the @xmath57 boson can decay into @xmath58 . since @xmath59 can only decay to @xmath60 at the tree level , hence the @xmath61 decay is invisible and it becomes constrained by the invisible @xmath57 decay width measurement .",
    "using table  [ fr ] in appendix  [ c ] , we obtain @xmath62 which violates the experimental uncertainty on the invisible @xmath57 width @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "thus we can conclude that the @xmath45 vev scenario of l - r symmetric models , with further discrete symmetries imposed , is ruled out .",
    "the additional discrete symmetries are discussed in appendix  [ a ] .      in this scenario",
    "the left - handed higgs triplet scalars do not mix with their bidoublet counterparts and they are the mass eigenstates by themselves .",
    "@xmath64 can be arbitrary in this case .",
    "the mass spectrum is given as ( see appendix  [ a ] for details ) , m^2_^0_l&=&_difv^2_r , + m^2_^+_l&=&_difv^2_r+^2_1  =  m^2_^0_l + ^2_1 , + m^2_^++_l&=&_difv^2_r+^2_1  =   m^2_^0_l + ^2_1 .",
    "we shall see in the subsequent sections that these masses , especially their differences , are of much phenomenological interest .",
    "in this section we discuss the vbf production of the doubly charged higgs boson and their decay channels .       contours ( dashed ) as a function of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "the constraint @xmath68 is shown by the black thick line .",

    "the @xmath21 has a hyper - charge , @xmath73 .",

    ", those gauge boson - scalar couplings proportional to @xmath44 will vanish .",
    "therefore the single production of @xmath13 by vbf processes is impossible .",
    "instead we study the production of a pair of doubly charged higgs @xmath75 .",
    "we shall also consider the associated production , @xmath76 , which increases the production cross - section by a factor of about 2 , as shown in fig .",

    "the tagged dijet pairs are sorted among themselves w.r.t their @xmath1 . ] .",
    "a further kinematic cut on the invariant mass of the two jets @xmath81 , combined with @xmath80 will be instrumental to reduce sm backgrounds . since the pair production of two heavy scalars require the incoming partons to be very energetic , the tagged vbf jets should also have high @xmath1 .",
    "the specific cuts are listed in section  [ results ] .",
    "the aforementioned final states can also be produced by dy processes , although the dy production mechanism is not accompanied by the forward - backward jets .",
    "@xcite made a comparison between the dy and vbf production and found vbf cross - section is @xmath82 of the dy cross - section for triplet scalar masses below @xmath83 .",
    "nevertheless the production of @xmath13 by vbf processes and it s subsequent discovery is of utmost importance . from the dy production of @xmath13",
    "one can not determine the origin of it .",
    "if the interaction of the left higgs triplet with @xmath9 boson is absent in the lagrangian in eq . , then two photon fusion will be the dominant mechanism for the pair production of @xmath13 by vbf processes .",
    "hence the correlation between vbf and dy cross - sections will be different from that if w - couplings were present .",
