    "the utility of the anisotropic lattice formulation in glueball spectroscopy  @xcite is well documented . in that case , using a lattice spacing which is finer in the temporal direction , @xmath0 , than in the spatial , @xmath1 , gives improved resolution of correlation - function decays with a minimal increase in computational workload .",
    "our recent work has centred on the application of anisotropic lattices to the simulation of relativistic heavy quarks .",
    "we use a tree - level improved fermionic action , specifically formulated for large anisotropies on a 3 + 1 lattice , which is free of classical discretisation errors that scale with @xmath2 .",
    "if the cutoff effects remain well - defined beyond the tree level , it should be possible to accurately simulate heavy - quark systems on lattices for which @xmath3 .      of critical importance",
    "is the dependence of the renormalised anisotropy @xmath4 , determined from simulations , on both the bare anisotropy , @xmath5 , and the bare quark mass .",
    "this report describes the tuning of the quark action parameters required to restore lorentz symmetry ( i.e. to restore the renormalised speed of light , @xmath6 , to its correct physical value of unity ) at 1-loop in perturbation theory .",
    "an analytic study of this action in the hamiltonian limit , @xmath7 ,  @xcite has yielded promising results . in that study ,",
    "corrections to the speed of light parameter in the action were calculated at 1-loop order and found to depend almost linearly on the combination @xmath8 .",
    "the results of our numerical investigation have also been positive  @xcite .",
    "the variation of the renormalised anisotropy measured from the dispersion relations of pseudoscalar and vector mesons was shown to be mild over a range of quark masses from strange to charm .",
    "the success of that exploratory work has motivated this more comprehensive investigation of the quantum corrections to the fermionic action using perturbation theory .",
    "the quark action keeps the usual wilson term in the temporal direction while using a hamber - wu - like term to remove doublers in the spatial directions @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants which we set to @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "tadpole improvement factors are contained in the definition of the lattice derivatives and the chromoelectric field .",
    "this action is classically improved to @xmath15 and further details of its construction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the symanzik - improved gauge action introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are spatial and temporal plaquettes and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are @xmath21 rectangles in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 planes respectively .",
    "@xmath24 is constructed from two spatial plaquettes separated by a single temporal link . in simulations , @xmath25 is chosen to avoid a critical point in the fundamental - adjoint action plane of @xmath26 . in perturbation theory , @xmath27 appears only through vertices involving four or more gluons and its value is irrelevant to our calculation .",
    "to calculate the corrections to the fermionic action , we consider an expansion of the quark energy in powers of the spatial momentum @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the rest mass and @xmath30 is the kinetic mass .",
    "setting @xmath31 restores lorentz invariance .",
    "this is the mass - dependent improvement condition suggested in ref .",
    "the deviation of the measured speed of light from unity can be attributed to two factors .",
    "firstly , at non - zero quark mass , the speed of light is modified by lattice artifacts even in the isotropic formalism .",
    "secondly , in this calculation , additional radiative corrections arise due to the different lattice spacing in the spatial and temporal directions and the inherent asymmetry of the actions used .    the relationship between @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the action parameters may be determined to any order in perturbation theory by expanding the all - orders dispersion relation  @xcite , corresponding to a pole in the momentum - space full quark propagator , in powers of the coupling . at the tree level , tuning the action parameters to satisfy the improvement condition amounts to a redefinition of @xmath32 , @xmath33 which leaves the action unchanged at @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , it is clear from the form of the action and the quark dispersion relation that higher - order radiative corrections can be also be absorbed into @xmath35 .",
    "the expression for the 1-loop coefficient is @xmath36 where the kinetic mass renormalisation factor , @xmath37 gives a measure of the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 due to radiative corrections . at 1-loop order , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "are independent of @xmath40 and eq .",
    "[ 1loop ] is a closed expression for the 1-loop correction to the action .",
    "the 1-loop coefficients of @xmath29 and @xmath41 have been calculated for a number of different quark actions in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . as these are physical quantities , each term in their perturbative expansion must be infrared finite and gauge - invariant .",
    "[ 1loop ] makes explicit the gauge invariance of @xmath40 which serves as an important check in our calculation .    in the limit @xmath42",
    ", the 1-loop coefficient reduces to the expression used in ref .",
    "the calculation of @xmath43 reduces to a determination of the 1-loop quark self - energy and its derivatives with respect to external momenta .",
    "details can be found in refs .",
    "expressions for the propagators and vertices were obtained using mathematica .",
    "the spin algebra required to obtain the loop integrands was initially performed with mathematica but later checked using an automated approach . to find derivatives , automatic differentiation  @xcite",
    "was used where analytic expressions would have been too unwieldy .",
    "we used the mean link in landau gauge to implement tadpole improvement .",
    "loop integrals were evaluated with vegas  @xcite .",
    "although the 1-loop coefficient is infrared finite , this depends on the cancellation of divergences in its constituent pieces .",
    "to calculate the integrals numerically , we introduced a small gluon mass , @xmath44 , as an intermediate regulator . for a given quark mass and bare anisotropy",
    ", we calculated @xmath43 over a range of gluon mass values and extrapolated to @xmath45 to obtain a final result .",
    "we present results for @xmath46 which was the bare anisotropy examined in ref .",
    "the 1-loop values given below are coefficients of @xmath47 . in this initial study",
    "we did not include a chromoelectric term in the fermionic action .    for wilson - type quarks",
    "there is an additive renormalisation of the bare quark mass .",
    "we find that at @xmath48 , the 1-loop critical bare mass corresponding to massless quarks is given by @xmath49 .",
    "[ rmass ] shows the 1-loop rest mass as a function of the tree - level rest mass .",
    ".,width=264 ]    [ rmass ]    @xmath50 varies smoothly and remains small over a range of values of @xmath51 .",
    "the main result , however , is the mass dependence of @xmath43 which is plotted in fig .",
    "the 1-loop correction to @xmath32 is extremely small and appears to vary linearly with the mass .",
    "this dependence is very weak and the value of @xmath43 changes by less than @xmath52 over the range considered .",
    "preliminary results for the speed of light renormalisation are in qualitative agreement with our previous work .",
    "we plan to carry out a detailed comparison of perturbative and non - perturbative tuning of the fermionic action in the near future .",
    "ultimately , this work will extend to a symanzik - type perturbative improvement program for the quark action including chromomagnetic interactions .",
