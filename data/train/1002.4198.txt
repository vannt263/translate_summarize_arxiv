    "this has been quantified in studies by @xcite and @xcite for the local universe and for the more distant universe by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies find that early - type galaxies in cluster environments are older than early - type galaxies residing in low - density , field environments , indicating that galaxies in cluster - like environments form at an earlier epoch .    further evidence that environment influences galaxy evolution is the observation of ` environment - dependent downsizing ' in galaxy clusters at @xmath7 .",
    "downsizing @xcite implies that the bright , massive galaxies move onto the red sequence first , whilst fainter galaxies are added at a later time .",

    "several studies have found that they are situated in overdense regions with properties expected of forming galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the dense cluster - like environments around hzrgs are likely not yet virialized and are commonly termed ` protoclusters ' .",
    "they are excellent laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in overdense environments .    in this study",

    "the irac bands and the @xmath20 band are excluded from this process as they have significantly larger psf sizes .",
    "smoothing the other images to the psf size of these images would negatively impact the quality of the analysis .",
    "because of the extreme smoothing required to match the resolution of the acs images to that of the ground - based data , the acs data were not used for the sed fitting and photometric redshift determination , but only for the determination of uv slopes of the protocluster galaxy candidates .",
    "photometry was obtained using the sextractor software @xcite in double image mode .",

    "if a known object was undetected in an image it was assigned the 3@xmath33 detection limit of the band in question . lowering this limit to @xmath34",
    "does not affect any of the conclusions presented in this paper .",
    "total magnitudes and fluxes in the detection bands were obtained by using the mag_auto function of sextractor .",
    "total fluxes in the remaining bands were obtained by scaling the respective isophotal magnitudes accordingly .    because of the large size ( fwhm ) of the psf in the irac images it was not possible to determine consistent colours using the isophotal apertures mentioned above . instead , the object flux was measured in a circular aperture of 20 pixel ( 4 ) , and a correction factor applied to match the photometry to the other bands .",
    "this correction factor was determined by smoothing the detection images to the spatial resolution of the irac data .",
    "object fluxes were measured in the smoothed detection images in 4  circular apertures , and compared to the flux measured from the unsmoothed detection images in the standard 3@xmath33 isophotal apertures .",
    "the ratio between the two fluxes yielded the correction factor .",
    "a similar process was applied to determine the colours in the @xmath20 image .",
    "the large fwhm of the psf in the irac bands also causes source confusion and contamination by neighbouring sources . for faint objects",
    "this effect can be a large source of error .",
    "all detected objects were visually inspected for contamination , and heavily contaminated objects have been removed from the analysis when relevant .    finally , all magnitudes were corrected for galactic foreground extinction determined from the @xcite extinction maps .",
    "photometric uncertainties and limiting magnitudes ( listed in table  [ table ] ) were computed using the method described in @xcite , which is summarized below . after masking all objects , the rms of pixels in the entire image and the rms of fluxes in apertures of various sizes were measured .",
    "we determined the noise in an aperture of size @xmath35 using the relation @xmath36 with @xmath37 the rms of pixels over the entire image and @xmath38 the rms within a certain aperture size @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath35 is defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the area of the aperture .",
    "the subscript ` i ' indicates the photometric band in question .",
    "the free parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 were then fitted such that it can be calculated what the noise is in an aperture of a given size .",
    "the uncertainty calculated using the rms of all the background pixels can be an underestimate , because it does not take into account pixel - to - pixel dependencies introduced in the reduction of the data .",
    "due to the irac photometry being more uncertain an additional 10 per cent uncertainty was added in quadrature for those four bands as has been done in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the completeness of the detection fields for point sources is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compl ] . the completeness was determined by extracting several bright , unsaturated stars from the images , averaging them to obtain a high signal - to - noise psf image and then inserting a number of these psfs at random locations in the images .",
    "the source extraction was repeated and the number of recovered artificial stars yielded the completeness as a function of magnitude . to avoid overcrowding only 150 objects",
    "were added at a time .",
    "this process was repeated ten times for each magnitude to obtain better statistics . due to the small field size of the isaac data the number of added objects",
    "was lowered to 50 and the process was repeated fifty times .",

    "these [ o iii ] emitters are blueshifted with respect to the rg indicating that the protocluster around 0316 may be part of a larger superstructure .",

    "the criterion uses the @xmath49 bands .",
    "even though the vimos field is larger , the @xmath31 passband is redder than @xmath15 passbands used in most other studies .",

    "since a significant number of objects lack deep nir coverage we include the more uncertain irac bands . to test the influence of the irac data on the photometric redshift determination we have determined the photometric redshifts both including and excluding the irac photometry .    the eazy code yields 4 different estimates of the redshift",
    ". it offers the options of applying both marginalization and a bayesian prior . in order to determine",

    "note that this will not be a completely consistent test case for the 0316 data , because the objects for which spectroscopic redshifts are available are in general brighter than @xmath61 , and the details concerning the depths in certain musyc bands are different from the 0316 dataset .    the comparison between @xmath60 and @xmath59 for the musyc galaxies is shown in fig .  [ fig : zzzs ] .",
    "the four panels show the results for four different methods of obtaining the photometric redshift . the scatter is quantified by the median absolute deviation of @xmath62 . for @xmath63 1.5",
    "applying both the prior and the marginalization yields the least amount of scatter ( @xmath64 ) and gives in general good agreement .",
    "however , application of the prior also shifts the objects with @xmath65 to @xmath66 .    since we target galaxies at @xmath5 , the photometric redshift determination without prior or marginalization yields the best results . comparing the scatter for @xmath65 yields @xmath67 for the upper left panel and @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the upper and lower right panels , respectively .",
    "the option that uses neither prior nor marginalization systematically overestimates the redshifts of objects at @xmath7 , placing them at @xmath70 instead .",
    "however , only 0.2 per cent of objects with @xmath71 are placed in the range @xmath72 , so this should have no significant effect on the results . in the remainder of this paper , photometric redshifts of the 0316 galaxies",
    "have been obtained using neither prior nor marginalization .    the photometric redshift distribution of the 0316 lbg candidates is shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : zphot ] .",
    "the majority of objects is situated at @xmath73 and strong peaks are seen at the redshift of the protocluster and @xmath74 .",
    "these peaks are artefacts caused by the discrete number of possible redshifts . excluding the irac data ( dotted line ) has little influence on the photometric redshift distribution .",
    "this is due to the inclusion of both @xmath20 and @xmath31 .",
    "both bands sample the strong lyman break feature of these galaxies and hence the photometric redshifts are well constrained .",
    "all objects within @xmath75 were selected for the final sample of 48 objects .",
    "this is based on the photometric redshift uncertainties shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : zphot ] . here",
    "the redshift uncertainty @xmath76 is taken to be half of the 1@xmath33 uncertainty interval yielded by eazy .",
    "the inset indicates that an uncertainty of 0.4 is a reasonable value to encompass all possible @xmath77 objects .",
    "the accuracy of photometric redshifts is not sufficient to verify if any of these objects are indeed members of the protocluster surrounding 0316 ; to achieve this spectroscopic redshifts are needed .      the balmer break can be used to select @xmath5 galaxies in a similar fashion to the lyman break method discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : samplbg ] .    extracting a sample of distant red galaxies ( drgs )",
    "was done by using the simple colour cut @xmath78 proposed by @xcite .",
    "the drg colour criterion samples red , predominantly massive galaxies between a redshift of 2 and 4 .",
    "although the nir filter sets used in this study differ from other studies the @xmath79 colour difference is typically @xmath280.02  mag , which is small compared to the photometric errors .",
    "therefore these colour terms are deemed negligible .",

    "the difference in the number of drgs in the k07 study and the present study is due to the stricter magnitude cut and the different parameter values used for source detection .",

    "as can be seen from the inset the uncertainty on the photometric redshift increases rapidly as the magnitude becomes fainter , with 1@xmath33 uncertainties @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "this is due to the faint @xmath20 and @xmath31 magnitudes of these objects resulting in a poorly constrained lyman break .",

    "the protocluster volume can host approximately 1.3 field lbgs .",

    "this is larger than the overdensities observed in the laes and [ oiii ] emitters , but this volume overdensity is little more than an order of magnitude estimate due to the many uncertainties in the assumptions that were made .",

    "we find that the 0316 lbgs have stellar masses , sfrs and uv slopes that are consistent with those of field lbgs .",

    "we have found that the 0316 field contains an overdensity of star forming galaxies .",
    "how will the protocluster lbgs evolve and at what epoch will a quiescent population emerge ?    using a simple ` back of the envelope ' calculation",

    "we find , however , that both these quantities are poorly constrained .",
    "hence , we make the following assumptions . since the distribution of sfhs peaks at approximately @xmath243  yr , we assume that the typical lbg has an sfh of 100500  myr .",
    "an age of 50500  myr is assumed , in accordance with earlier studies that state 100  myr to be the typical age for lbgs at @xmath84 @xcite .",

    "[ sec : discprop ] are consistent with the results for the 0316 lbgs . for simplicity the influence of dust extinction will not be taken into account in this scenario .",
    "if a quiescent galaxy is defined as having an sfr @xmath244  yr@xmath12 we find that the majority of a population of lbgs will have reached quiescence after a period of approximately 1  gyr .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath129 . only the youngest lbgs having @xmath245  myr will last until @xmath246 before they reach quiescence .",
    "therefore , the 0316 protocluster should harbour a substantial ` dead ' population after 1  gyr of evolution .",
    "these predictions can be compared to observations of protocluster structures at lower redshifts .",
    "one of the best studied protoclusters is the overdense region surrounding the @xmath247 radio galaxy pks  1138262 ( 1138 ) @xcite .",
    "this radio galaxy has a intricate , clumpy morphology and seems to be in an advanced stage of merging with several smaller galaxies .",
    "it is surrounded by a diffuse uv halo which is evidence for in - situ star formation outside the main radio galaxy @xcite .",

    "@xcite has also shown that the eros and h@xmath1 emitting galaxies are located closer to the radio galaxy than the bluer star forming galaxies .",
    "the 1138 protocluster is therefore a prime example of a @xmath248 galaxy cluster progenitor .",
    "@xcite have shown that the 1138 system contains red galaxies , some of which might be quiescent . however , the red sequence is still in the stages of formation and has not been properly established yet .",
    "this is in agreement with studies by @xcite and @xcite that state that the formation redshift of the red sequence lies in the range @xmath18722.5 .",
    "this roughly agrees with our toy model for the 0316 protocluster",
    ". a significant number of red galaxies should be in place as early as @xmath249 .",
    "this is earlier than what most studies predict but we are limited by the simplicity of this calculation . if the sfh is episodic and burst - like the time it takes for an lbg to become quiescent increases , so we expect the red sequence will form at a later time than estimated by this toy model .",
    "we predict that the population of galaxies currently residing in the 0316 protocluster will resemble the 1138 protocluster after 1  gyr of evolution and 0316 , like the 1138 protocluster , will evolve into a rich galaxy cluster at @xmath134 .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study of several galaxy populations in the protocluster associated with mrc 0316 - 257 at @xmath10 , using restframe fuv to optical images .",
    "in addition to studying the laes and [ oiii ] emitters found in previous studies , we identify samples of lbg and bbg candidates whose properties provide additional evidence for the presence of a protocluster .    1 .",
    "the cumulative number density of the lbg candidates in the 0316 field is a factor of 1.6@xmath2500.3 larger than for comparable non - protocluster fields at similar redshifts , indicating a surface overdensity of 0.6@xmath2500.3 for lbgs in the protocluster .",

    "the redshift distribution of the bbg candidates shows a peak at the redshift of the radio galaxy .",
