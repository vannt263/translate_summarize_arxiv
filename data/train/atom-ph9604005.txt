    "this formula may be derived heuristically by the quantization of the angular momentum ( half - integer or integer ) of the electromagnetic field in a system consisting of two dyons @xcite .",
    "e. purcell and n. ramsey in ref .",
    "@xcite and n. ramsey @xcite discussed the possibility of there being elementary particle and nuclear edms due to the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "later , e. witten @xcite showed that t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopoles carry small electric charges due to cp violating interactions . in the case of the @xmath12-term ( the interaction @xmath13 ) the electric charge of the monopole is @xmath14 .",
    "v. sokolov developed nonrelativistic lagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms for the interaction of electric and magnetic charges which do not involve `` strings '' @xcite .",
    "it is possible that monopoles may appear in particle - antiparticle pairs in which the point - like positive and negative magnetic charges could be very hard or impossible to separate . recall that a `` supercritical '' electric charge @xmath15 with @xmath16 must be screened down to the value @xmath17 due to spontaneous @xmath18 pair production .",
    "the strength of the interaction in this case ( @xmath19 ) is still smaller than @xmath20 ( using the quantization rule for magnetic charge ) .",
    "also , nambu showed that in the standard electroweak model the classical solution is a monopole - antimonopole pair connected by a @xmath21-field string @xcite .",
    "this could explain the absence of free monopoles .",
    "however even in this case one can still search for the effects of virtual monopole - antimonopole pairs and this will be discussed in the present paper .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that an electric dipole moment ( edm ) of an atom ( or any quantum system ) can be induced by the interaction of the electrons with a radial magnetic field ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the existence of such a field would contradict both time reflection invariance ( t ) and gauss s law ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the limit on such a field can be of interest by itself as a very precise test of electrodynamics at small distances since the accuracy of edm measurements is very high now .",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite that a radial magnetic field can be produced due to a monopole - antimonopole pair contribution to the magnetic moment ( if there is no magnetic string ) and a time invariance violating interaction which polarizes nucleon spins along the radial direction .",
    "the mechanisms of radial magnetic field and edm creation can be much simpler if the magnetic monopole has an electric charge or is subject to the strong interaction .",
    "the simplest example would be for a magnetic charge to be captured by an atomic nucleus and hence produce a `` coulomb '' magnetic field @xmath24 .",
    "it is easy to find the exact solution of this problem ( an electron in the field of the dyon ) in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "all stationary states in this problem possess an edm .",
    "another example is a dyon - antidyon system with nonzero orbital angular momentum .",
    "similarly to the way in which orbiting electric charges produce a magnetic moment , orbiting magnetic charges produce an edm @xcite",
    ".    the most interesting possibility would be for the radial magnetic field and edm to be induced by the virtual production of dyon - antidyon pairs",
    ". the mechanism could be the following .",
    "the electric field of an atomic nucleus polarizes the vacuum of dyon pairs and creates corrections to the radial electric field , @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio of the magnetic to the electric field produced by these dyons is @xmath26 .",
    "thus dyon vacuum polarization produces the radial magnetic field @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction of atomic electrons with this magnetic field produces an atomic edm .",
    "a similar mechanism could produce 35 orders of magnitude bigger p , t - odd effects in diatomic polar molecules .",
    "we also consider the contribution of this mechanism to the neutron edm in the constituent quark model .",
    "note that the electric field can be replaced by the strong field if the monopole interacts strongly .",
    "moreover , it seems that `` chromodyons '' , which could exist in a generalization of qcd , could produce similar effects to that of `` electromagnetic '' dyons . thus the problem considered in the present work",
    "could be related to the recent ideas about the role of monopole condensate in quark confinement ( see e.g. the recent review in @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the possible effects of time invariance violation in atoms , molecules and the neutron produced by a radial magnetic field .",
    "we also estimate the field produced by the polarization of the dyon vacuum according to the mechanism discussed above .",
    "an accurate calculation of the monopole effects requires the solution of numerous complicated problems such as the large value of the magnetic charge , `` strings '' , the finite size of the classical monopole solution , etc .",
    "we stress that in the present work we are mainly trying to avoid these problems rather than to solve them .",
    "in fact we explore an approach using simple heuristic arguments and perturbation theory which allows us to estimate and compare the values of t , p - odd effects in different quantum systems .",
    "we must add that our attempt to use the results of two - vector potential theory for the dyon electrodynamics @xcite ( see also @xcite ) has lead to the conclusion that the magnetic field due to dyon vacuum polarization seems to vanish within this theory .",
    "( this contradicts the simple and natural picture discussed above !",
    "note however that the theory @xcite includes dyons only and the introduction of the usual charges into this theory leads to serious complications . )",
    "an alternative approach is to use the theories with t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopoles .",
    "we have not done any calculations within these theories .",
    "our more simple `` heuristic '' calculation of the radial magnetic field due to dyon vacuum polarization ( see below ) is not based on a complete consistent theory and strictly speaking does not prove the existence of the effect .",
    "however , the calculations of the effects of this field in sections [ sc][se ] apply to any contact radial magnetic field ; they are not restricted to fields produced by dyon vacuum polarization .",
    "thus , the results in these sections can be used in general by using the equations in terms of @xmath28 ( @xmath28 is defined below ) .",
    "let us start from an estimate of the radial magnetic field which could be produced due to polarization of the dyon vacuum by an electric charge .",
    "the correction to the electrostatic potential @xmath29 due to the vacuum polarization of spin @xmath30 particles can be found in any textbook on quantum electrodynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath31 where @xmath10 and @xmath32 are the electric charge and mass of the dyons .",
    "( in fact , @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is the threshold of production of a dyon pair .",
    "in the case of a bound pair ( connected e.g. by a @xmath21-string ) we could substitute the mass of the two - dyon system instead . ) the magnetic field due to the dyons can be expressed in terms of the corresponding electric field : @xmath34 , where @xmath6 is the magnetic charge .",
    "if the dyons are heavy then the potential can be written as @xmath35 , where the constant can be found by the integration of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) over @xmath36",
    ". thus polarization of the dyon vacuum produces the following radial magnetic field around the point - like charge @xmath37 : @xmath38 with @xmath39 note that t - invariance in this case can be restored if there is one more dyon with the same mass but the opposite sign of the product @xmath40 .",
    "we can obtain the radial magnetic field of the nucleus by replacing @xmath41 by the proton density distribution , @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a radial unit vector and @xmath45 .",
    "here we took into account the fact that the nuclear density varies in a small interval around the nuclear radius @xmath46 .",
    "consider now the interaction between an atomic electron and the contact radial magnetic field . a radial magnetic field can not be described by a nonsingular vector potential @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we will avoid using the vector potential .",
    "let us start from the nonrelativistic problem .",
    "the interaction between the spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field does not contain the vector potential :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 are pauli matrices .",
    "for the electron @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . note that @xmath28 in the above equation is only given by eq .",
    "( [ e2ex2 ] ) for the dyon vacuum polarization mechanism , and can otherwise be considered as a more general parameter .",
    "the orbital contribution to the interaction seems to vanish due to a cancelation between the contributions of the radial magnetic field of the nucleus and that of the electron .",
    "let us first calculate the force acting on the electron from the radial magnetic field of the nucleus , in the latter s rest frame : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electron s velocity . to calculate the second force acting on the electron , we first calculate the force acting on the nucleus from the magnetic field of the electron @xmath54 .",
    "since the electron is in motion , this magnetic field will be transformed into an electric field in the rest frame of the nucleus : @xmath55 ( to terms of order @xmath56 ) .",
    "let us assume for now that the radial magnetic field around a particle is proportional to its electric charge .",
    "this is obviously true for the magnetic field due to the dyon vacuum polarization mechanism in eqs .",
    "( [ e2ex1 ] ) and ( [ e2ex2 ] ) , however this discussion is intended to be more general .",
    "( an argument for this proportionality that is based on angular momentum quantization will be given below . ) under this assumption the force on the nucleus from the electric field ( [ electric ] ) is exactly equal to @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) . according to newton",
    "s third law the corresponding force acting on the electron from the nucleus is @xmath58 , i.e. the net force acting on the electron is @xmath59 .",
    "one can say that a cancelation occurs between the force @xmath57 acting on the electron from the vacuum monopole distribution near the nucleus and the force @xmath60 acting on the vacuum monopole distribution near the electron due to the electric field of the nucleus .",
    "there is a second argument in favor of the cancelation of the orbital contribution .",
    "as is known @xcite , the radial magnetic field of a magnetic charge and the radial electric field of an electric charge together produce a nonzero angular momentum around the axis connecting the charges ( @xmath61 ) . in quantum mechanics angular momentum",
    "is quantized .",
    "this requirement implies the quantization of the product of the magnetic and the electric charges . for two dyons",
    "this condition is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the projection of the angular momentum @xmath64 onto the axis connecting these particles and @xmath65 is a unit vector along this axis .",
    "recall that the system s orbital angular momentum is orthogonal to the connecting axis and does not contribute to @xmath66 .",
    "we see that for @xmath67 the electromagnetic field angular momentum is zero due to the cancelation between the contributions of these two dyons .",
    "a similar situation arises for the short - range induced magnetic field .",
    "if both the radial magnetic fields of the electron and the point - like nucleus are proportional to their charges then the angular momentum of the field will be zero due to a cancelation between the two contributions .",
    "( actually , the nucleus is not point - like , therefore , strictly speaking , we should consider an electron - quark system here . )",
    "we stress that in the absence of such a cancelation there would be a problem : the size of the magnetic field region is very small ( @xmath68 ) , and so we can not satisfy the condition of angular momentum quantization for nonzero @xmath66 ( this provides an argument for the proportionality of the radial magnetic fields to the electric charges ) .",
    "now there is a relation between the orbital contribution to the edm of the two - particle system and @xmath66 .",
    "the angular wave function for the system is the wigner @xmath69-function , @xmath70 , where @xmath6 is the projection of @xmath71 onto the z - axis ( compare e.g. with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the charge - monopole solution was found ) .",
    "the orbital contribution to the edm in such an angular state is proportional to the angular integral @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "this relation is especially simple for @xmath73 since the @xmath69-function in this case coincides with the usual @xmath74 angular function which gives an ( orbital ) edm of zero .",
    "thus , we can consider the zero value of the electromagnetic field angular momentum in the electron - nucleus case to be an argument for the absence of an orbital contribution to the electric dipole moment .",
    "we must stress that there is no such cancelation between the contributions of the magnetic moments of the nucleus and the electron ( see eq .",
    "( [ nonrel ] ) ) since these magnetic moments are very different .",
    "for example , the nuclear magnetic moment can be zero .    in the relativistic case",
    "the interaction of a magnetic moment @xmath75 with a magnetic field can be expressed in terms of the magnetic field only using the following well known identity ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath76 where the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "is an orbital contribution to the electromagnetic current and the second term is a spin one and @xmath77 .",
    "taking into account the fact that @xmath78 we obtain ( from @xmath79 ) a relativistic expression for the interaction of a magnetic moment @xmath75 with the radial magnetic field ( [ e3 ] ) : @xmath80 expression ( [ e5 ] ) can also be obtained from the quadratic form of the dirac equation .",
    "in this section we calculate the contribution of dyons to the atomic edm , as well as their effect on molecules .",

    "see tables [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] .",
