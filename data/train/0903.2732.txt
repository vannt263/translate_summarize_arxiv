    "two main cases will be discussed : @xmath0 cosmology with a constant equation of state ( eos ) fluid , and @xmath0 cosmology in the presence of a phantom fluid . in the last case , a couple of specific example will be worked through in detail , namely one with a phantom fluid with constant eos and , as a second example , a fluid with dynamical eos of the type proposed in refs .",

    "we now consider the action corresponding to one of these theories which , aside from the gravity part , also contains a matter contribution , namely s = d^4x  . [ 1.1 ] here @xmath2 , and @xmath3 stands for the lagrangian corresponding to matter of some kind .",
    "note that the first term in ( [ 1.1 ] ) is just the usual hilbert - einstein action , and the @xmath0 term can be considered , as will be shown below , as the dynamical part of some kind of perfect fluid ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , which may constitute an equivalent to the so - called dark fluids .",

    ". we can now investigate the existence of these points for the model ( [ 2.1 ] ) by introducing the critical points @xmath18 in the friedmann equation ( [ 2.1a ] ) 3h^2_0=-+3h^2_0  .",

    "( [ 2.1d ] ) can have either two or no positive roots .",
    "as shown below , one of these roots is identified as an effective cosmological constant that produces the current accelerated expansion of the universe , while the second root can produce the inflationary epoch under some initial conditions .",

    "this can be achieved , as is already known for the function ( [ 1.8a ] ) , by choosing specific values of the free parameters . even in the case of stable ds inflation ,",
    "exit from it can be achieved by coupling it with matter , by the effect of a small non - local term ( or by some other mechanism ) .",
    "let us now study the details of this same model at the current epoch , when it is assumed that f(r ) produces the cosmic acceleration and where the matter component is taken into account .",
    "function ( [ 2.1 ] ) is depicted in fig .  1 ;",
    "its minimum is attained at @xmath20 , which is assumed to be the current value of the ricci scalar .",

[",
    "2.3 ] as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the perturbations @xmath26 around the current point @xmath20 may be neglected .",
    "therefore , we can study the evolution of the energy density ( [ 1.4 ] ) for the @xmath0 term as the eos parameter defined by ( [ 1.5 ] ) around the minimum of the @xmath0 function , which is assumed to be the present value of the ricci scalar . for such purposes , it is useful to rewrite the hubble function ( [ 2.3 ] ) as a function of the redshift @xmath27 , instead of @xmath1 .",
    "the relation between both variables can be expressed as = = ^  , [ 2.4 ] where @xmath28 is taken as the current value of the scale parameter , and @xmath29 , being @xmath30 the current value of the energy density of the matter contribution .",
    "hence , the hubble parameter ( [ 2.3 ] ) is expressed as a function of the redshift @xmath27 , as h^2(z)=  .",
    "[ 2.5 ] thus , the model characterized by the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) with the function ( [ 2.1 ] ) and a matter fluid with constant eos , depends on the free parameters ( @xmath31 ) contained in the expression of @xmath0 and also on the value of the eos parameter ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "when imposing the minimum value for the function @xmath0 to take place at present time ( @xmath33 ) , the free parameters can be adjusted with the observable data .",
    "then we study the behavior of our model close to @xmath33 , where the contributions of non - linear terms produced by the function ( [ 2.1 ] ) are assumed not to modify the solution ( [ 2.5 ] ) . in spite of the hubble parameter being unmodified , for @xmath27 close to zero ,",
    "the energy density @xmath34 will in no way remain constant for small values of the redshift . to study the behavior of the @xmath0 energy density given by ( [ 1.4 ] )",
    "it is convenient to express it as the cosmological parameter , @xmath35 , which can be written as _",
    "f(r)(z)=-+f(r)-18f(r )  , [ 2.6 ] where the ricci scalar is given by @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "this expression ( [ 2.6 ] ) can be studied as a function of the redshift .",
    "as we are considering the solution ( [ 2.5 ] ) , which has been calculated near @xmath33 , where the @xmath0 function has a minimum , the second term in the expression ( [ 2.6 ] ) is negligible as compared with the other two terms ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this aproximation , as the solution ( [ 2.5 ] ) , is valid for values of the ricci scalar close to @xmath22 , where the higher derivatives of @xmath0 are small compared with the function .",
    "the aproximation is no longer valid when the f(r ) derivatives are comparable with f(r ) .",
    "then , as discussed above , the free parameters of the model can be fitted by the current observational values of the cosmological parameters , and by fixing the minimum of @xmath0 to occur for @xmath38 .",
    "we shall use the value for the hubble parameter @xmath39 with @xmath40 and the matter density @xmath41 given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the evolution of the @xmath0 energy density ( [ 2.6 ] ) is represented for the model described by ( [ 2.1 ] ) , where the matter content is taken to be pressureless ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the cosmological evolution shown corresponds to redshifts from @xmath43 to @xmath33 . for redshifts larger than @xmath43 perturbations around the solution ( [ 2.3 ] ) are non - negligible , and the expression for the hubble parameter ( [ 2.3 ] ) is no more valid . however , in spite of the fact that the evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is not a complete picture of the @xmath0 model given by ( [ 2.1 ] ) , it still provides an illustrative example to compare it to the standard @xmath44 model , which is also represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , around the present time . as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "both models have two common points for @xmath33 and @xmath45 , while the behavior of each model between such points is completely different from one another .",
    "this result shows the possible differences between @xmath0 models of the type ( [ 1.9 ] ) and the @xmath44 model , although probably other viable models for @xmath0 gravity may give a different adjustment to the @xmath44 model ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the effective eos parameter for the @xmath0 fluid , @xmath46 , given by the expression ( [ 1.5 ] ) , is plotted in fig .  3 , again as a function of redshift .",
    "it is shown there that @xmath46 is close to @xmath47 for @xmath33 , where the @xmath0 fluid behaves like an effective cosmological constant , while it grows for redshifts up to @xmath48 , where it reaches a zero value . according to the analysis of observational dataset from supernovae ( see ref.@xcite ) , the results obtained for the evolution of the eos parameter , represented in fig .  3 ,",
    "are allowed by the observations .",

    "it takes values close to @xmath47 for @xmath33 , and it grows for higher redshifts.,width=384,height=288 ]    as a consequence , the @xmath0 model given by ( [ 2.1 ] ) , and where the @xmath0 fluid behaves as an effective cosmological constant , is able indeed to reproduce the same behavior at present time as the @xmath44 model . on the other hand , as was pointed out in the section above , the @xmath0 model given by ( [ 2.1 ] ) also reproduces the accelerated expansion of the inflation epoch , so that the next natural step to undertake with this kind of models should be to study their complete cosmological histories , and the explicit details allowing for a grateful exit from inflation , what should demonstrate their true potential .",
    "also note that , in order to obtain a realistic well behaved model , further analysis should be carried out , as the comparison with the luminosity distance from supernovae , or the data from cmb surveys , although this is a major task , that will be left for future work .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 functions of this kind might even lead to a solution of the cosmological constant problem , by involving a relaxation mechanism of the cosmological constant , as was proposed in ref .",
    "the effective cosmological constant obtained could eventually adjust to the observable value .",
    "this will also require a deeper investigation .      according to several analysis of observational data ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , the effective eos parameter of the physical theory that governs our universe should quite probably be less than @xmath47 , what means that we should be ready to cope with phantom behavior .",
    "this possibility has been explored in @xmath0 theory @xcite , where the possibility to construct an @xmath0 function that reproduces this kind of behavior has been demonstrated , and where the possible future singularities envisaged , as the big rip , so common in phantom models , do take place .",
    "an example is given by ( see @xcite ) f(r)~r^1-/2  , =  , [ 2.6a ] here @xmath49 is a positive constant , and @xmath50 . in this case , the solution , neglecting other possible components , is the following h(t)~  , [ 2.6b ] where the hubble parameter diverges at the rip time @xmath51 .",
    "another kind of @xmath0 gravity that reproduces a phantom behavior , but avoids the big rip singularity , is f(r)=  , [ 2.6c ] where @xmath49 is a positive constant ( for other @xmath0 models with transient phantom behavior , see @xcite ) .",
    "the solution obtained is h(t)=h_0 t+  .",
    "[ 2.6d ] in this last example , the universe has a phantom behavior at large time but there is no big rip singularity .",
    "however , the main problem of those models is that the corresponding @xmath0 function is not well constrained at small scales",
    ".    we will now study the behavior of the cosmological evolution when a phantom fluid is introduced that contributes to the accelerated expansion .",
    "a phantom fluid can be described , in an effective way , by an eos @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "this eos can be achieved , for example , with a negative kinetic term or in the context of scalar - tensor theory .",
    "the microphysical study of this kind of fluids is a problem of fundamental physics that has been studied in several works ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) , as it is also the study of stability of the solutions .",
    "but it is not the aim for this paper to discuss , in this depth , the features of phantom fields , and it will suffice for our purpose to consider the effective eos that describes a phantom fluid . the @xmath0 function we will consider is the same as above , given by ( [ 1.9 ] ) , which will contribute as an effective cosmological constant at present time .",
    "the motivation for this case study comes , as will be further explored , from the difficulty one encounters in constructing _ viable _",
    "@xmath0 functions which produce phantom epochs , and this problem has a translation in the scalar - tensor picture in the einstein frame too .",
    "as recent observational data suggest ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , the effective eos parameter for dark energy is around @xmath47 , so that the phantom case is allowed ( and even still favored ) by recent , accurate , and extensive observations .",
    "example 1 .",
    "first , we consider a phantom fluid with constant eos , e.g. , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a constant . as in the case above , the @xmath0 function will be given by ( [ 2.1 ] ) , and it will be assumed that its current value is attained at the minimum @xmath54 .",
    "we here neglect other contributions , as the dust term studied previously .",
    "friedmann equations take the form h^2=_ph+  , = -_ph(1+w_ph )  .",
    "[ 2.7 ] an expanding solution ( note that a contracting solution can be obtained from the above equations too ) for these equations is given by h(t)=+  , [ 2.8 ] where @xmath51 is called the rip time , that means the instant where a future big rip singularity will take place .",
    "although for @xmath1 much bigger than the present time , the solution ( [ 2.8 ] ) is not valid anymore because perturbations , due to the derivatives of the function @xmath0 , become large and as the ricci scalar @xmath16 grows with time , this model will behave as @xmath55 for large times , which is known to produce accelerated expansion , and whose behavior is described by ( see @xcite ) h(t )  , [ 2.8a ] where @xmath56 .",
    "and the effective eos parameter for large time is w_eff=-1-  .",
    "[ 2.8b ]    that is to say , the universe will go through a super - accelerated expansion stage due to the phantom fluid and to the contribution coming from @xmath0 , until it reaches the big rip singularity . in this case where no other contribution , as dust matter or radiation , is taken into account ,",
    "late - time acceleration comes from the phantom behavior when the dark fluid component dominates , while the universe behaves as dark energy when the @xmath0 term is the dominant one ( as was in absence of this phantom fluid ) . in other words ,",
    "the universe would not accelerate as a phantom one alone , but it will as a dark energy fluid with @xmath57 .",
    "this is a fundamental point : the additional dark fluid is essential for a universe described by the @xmath0 function given in ( [ 2.1 ] ) to display a phantom transition .",
    "we can study the evolution of this phantom fluid by using the continuity equation : _ ph+3h _",
    "ph(1+w_ph)=0  , [ 2.9 ] which can be solved , at the present time , when the hubble parameter is expressed by eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "then , the following solution is obtained _",
    "ph=_0ph  , [ 2.10 ] where @xmath58 is an integration constant .",
    "as we can see , the energy density for the phantom fluid grows with time until the rip value is reached where the energy density becomes infinite . on the other hand",
    ", the evolution of the @xmath0 term may be studied qualitatively by observing the expression given for the energy density of this fluid in ( [ 1.4 ] ) , so that this evolution is similar to the one in the above case .",
    "that is , as the value of the ricci scalar increases with time , it is natural to suppose that , in the past , the energy density belonging to @xmath0 had smaller values than at present , so that the matter dominated epoch could occur when the @xmath0 fluid and the phantom fluid were much less important than they are now .",
    "again , for this kind of model the @xmath0 contribution amounts currently to an effective cosmological constant which drives the universe s acceleration .",
    "example 2 . as a second example of a phantom fluid",
    ", we consider one with a dynamical eos of the type proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", a dark fluid is present which has an inhomogeneous eos that may depend on the proper evolution of the universe .",
    "this kind of eos can be derived from the dynamics of an scalar field with some characteristic potential and a variable kinetic term ( see @xcite ) , or either it may be seen as the effective eos corresponding to the addition of various components that fill up our universe .",
    "an eos of this kind can be written as p_ph = w_ph + g(h , , ... ; t )  , [ 2.11 ] where @xmath59 is a constant and @xmath60 an arbitrary function .",
    "the interesting point is that it is possible to specify a function @xmath60 so that a complete solution of the friedmann equations is obtained . in this case ,",
    "our aim is to study a fluid that at present ( or in the near future ) can behave as phantom ; to that purpose we choose @xmath61 , and the role of the @xmath60 function will be to determine when exactly the phantom barrier is crossed .",
    "thus , our model will be described by the phantom fluid in ( [ 2.11 ] ) and the function @xmath0 of ( [ 2.1 ] ) , while the matter component can be neglected . as an example , the eos for the dark fluid is given by p_ph=-_ph - ( h(t)+p_f(r)+_f(r ) )  , [ 2.12 ] where the prime denotes derivative with respect to time , and @xmath62 and @xmath34 are the energy densities defined in ( [ 1.4 ] ) . as it is shown , through the eos defined in ( [ 2.12 ] ) , the dark fluid will contribute to the acceleration of the universe as a dark energy , and subsequently as a phantom fluid when it crosses the barrier @xmath53 .",
    "we thus see that in this model accelerated expansion comes from two contributions , the @xmath0 term ( [ 2.1 ] ) and the dark fluid one ( [ 2.12 ] ) , so that the accelerated expansion stage could cross the phantom barrier if the dark fluid dominates and contributes as a phantom one .",
    "the difference with respect to the former model is that in the present case the dark fluid changes its behavior in the course of the expansion history ( this will be seen again in an example below ) . as the eos given in ( [ 2.12 ] )",
    "can be rewritten in terms of the ricci scalar @xmath5 , it can be seen as additional terms to our f(r ) function , in order to get the transition to the phantom epoch in the context of f(r ) gravity . with the eos ( [ 2.12 ] ) , the friedmann equations can be solved , the following solution being found h(t)=h(t )  .

    "we are here interested in those solutions that give rise to a phantom epoch ; for those cases the following splitting of the hubble parameter is relevant h(t)=+  , [ 2.14 ] where @xmath49 , @xmath64 and @xmath51 ( rip time ) are positive constants .",
    "this function describes a universe that starts in a singularity , at @xmath65which may be identified with the big bang one  then evolves to a matter dominated epoch , after which an accelerated epoch starts which is dominated by an effective cosmological constant and , finally , the universe enters into a phantom epoch that will end in a big rip singularity . as in the cases above",
    ", the condition ( [ 2.2 ] ) remains , that is @xmath66 , where @xmath22 is the present value of the ricci scalar .",
    "4 is an illustration of how this model works : we see there that the universe goes through a decelerated epoch until it enters a region where the evolution of its expansion has constant hubble parameter and the @xmath0 term behaves as an effective cosmological constant .",
    "finally , at @xmath67 the universe enters into a super - accelerated phase which is dominated by the dark fluid of eq .",
    "( [ 2.12 ] ) , until it eventually reaches the big rip singularity at @xmath68 .",

    "term with respect to @xmath5 is represented as a function of time ( dotted curve ) ; the constant hubble parameter region is given by a constant @xmath0 , which plays the role of an effective cosmological constant .",
    "starting at @xmath69 , the universe enters into a phantom region dominated by the dark fluid , which ends at @xmath68 when the big rip singularity takes over.,width=288,height=288 ]    alternatively , the evolution of the eos parameter for the dark fluid ( [ 2.12 ] ) can be written as w_ph=-1-  , [ 2.15 ] and we may look at its asymptotic behavior , 0<t<<t_0w_ph~-1 +  .",
    "t~t_0 w_ph~-1-  .",
    "t_0,t_ph<<t < t_s w_ph~-1-  . [ 2.16 ] we thus see that , at the starting stages of the universe , the dark fluid contributes to the deceleration of its expansion . for @xmath1 close to the present time , @xmath70 , it works as a contribution to an effective cosmological constant and , after @xmath69 , it gives rise to the transition to a phantom era of the cosmos , which could actually be taking place nowadays at some regions of it .",
    "our hope is that it could even be observable with specific measurements .",
    "finally , for @xmath1 close to the rip time , the universe becomes completely dominated by the dark fluid , whose eos is phantom at that time .",
    "this model , which is able to accurately reproduce the dark energy period , may still be modified in such a way that the epoch which is dominated by the effective cosmological constant , produced by the @xmath0 term and by the dark fluid contribution , becomes significantly shorter .",
    "this is supposed to happen when a matter term is included .",
    "to finish this section , the inclusion of a dark fluid that behaves as a phantom one gives rise to a super - accelerated phase , as compared with the case where just the viable @xmath0 term contributes . in the two examples here studied ,",
    "we have proven that , while the @xmath0 term contributes as an effective cosmological constant , the dark fluid contribution produces the crossing of the phantom barrier , and it continues to dominate until the end of the universe in a big rip singularity .",
    "in other words , both the contribution of @xmath0 and of the phantom fluid are needed .",
    "this is very clearly seen before , and the nice thing is that , because of this interplay , we have shown the appearance of nice properties of our model that no purely phantom model could have .",
    "specifically , for our models above , @xmath0 gravity together with phantom matter , the effective @xmath59 value becomes in fact bigger than -1 , so that we are able to show that @xmath0 gravity can solve the phantom problem simply by making the phantom field to appear as a normal one .",
    "we now turn to the study of the solutions given above in the alternative , and more commonly used , scalar - tensor picture . in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , it was pointed out that @xmath0 gravity can be written in terms of a scalar field ",
    "quintessence or phantom like  by redefining the function @xmath0 with the use of a convenient scalar field and then performing a conformal transformation .",
    "the scalar - tensor theory thus obtained provides a solution which is characterized by this conformal transformation , whose expression depends on the precise form of the @xmath0 function .",
    "it has been shown that , in general , for any given @xmath0 , the corresponding scalar - tensor theory can in principle be obtained , although the solution is going to be very different from case to case .",
    "also attention has been paid to the reconstruction of @xmath0 gravity from a given scalar - tensor theory .",
    "it is also known ( see @xcite ) that the phantom case in scalar - tensor theory does not allow , in general , the corresponding picture in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "in fact , the conformal transformation becomes complex when the phantom barrier is crossed , and then the resulting @xmath0 function becomes complex too . to avoid this hindrance , a dark fluid can be used , as in the models of the preceding section , in order to produce the phantom behavior in such a way that the reconstructed @xmath0 function continues to be _",
    "this point is important , and will be clearly shown below . also to be remarked",
    "is the fact that scalar - tensor theories , commonly used in cosmology to reproduce dark energy ( see for example @xcite ) , provide cosmological solutions whose stability should be studied in order to demonstrate the validity of the solution found .",
    "this has been investigated , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite and requires a very deep and careful analysis . for the purpose of the current paper",
    ", we will here concentrate in the proof the existence of the solution in the scalar - tensor counterpart , and the corresponding stability study will be left for future work .",
    "we start with the construction of the scalar - tensor theory from @xmath0 gravity . the action ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "can be written as s = d^4x  , [ 3.1 ] which is known as the jordan frame . here",
    "@xmath0 has been written in terms of a scalar field . to recover the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) in terms of @xmath0 , the scalar field equation resulting from the variation of the action ( [ 3.1 ] ) with respect to @xmath71",
    "is used , which can be expressed as follows p()r+q()=0  , [ 3.2 ] where the primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath71 .",
    "then , by solving equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) we get the relation between the scalar field @xmath71 and the ricci scalar , @xmath72 . in this way",
    ", the original @xmath0 function and the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) are recovered : r + f(r)= p((r))r+q((r ) )  .",
    "[ 3.3 ] finally , the scalar - tensor picture is obtained by performing a conformal transformation on the action ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "the relation between both frames is given by g_e= ^2 g _  , ^2= p ( )  , [ 3.4 ] where the subscript @xmath73 stands for einstein frame .",
    "a quintessence - like action results in the einstein frame @xmath74\\ , \\ ] ] where ( ) = ( ) ^2  , u()=   ( ) = p ( )  , [ 3.5 ] are the kinetic term , the scalar potential and the coupling function , respectively .",
    "hence , by following the steps enumerated above , we can reconstruct the scalar - tensor theory described by the action ( [ 3.5 ] ) for a given @xmath0 gravity . by redefining the scalar field @xmath75 , and after combining eqs .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) , the form of the two functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are found p()=1+f ( )  , q()=f()-f ( )  .",
    "[ 3.6 ] hence , for a given solution in the jordan frame ( [ 3.1 ] ) , the solution in the corresponding quintessence / phantom scalar field scenario  i.e .",
    ", in the einstein frame ( [ 3.5])is obtained by the conformal transformation ( [ 3.4 ] ) , and it is given by a_e(t_e)= ^1/2a(t )   dt_e= ^1/2dt  . [ 3.7 ] we will be here interested in the phantom case . with that purpose",
    ", we analyze the model described in the above section by the @xmath0 function ( [ 2.1 ] ) and the dark fluid with eos ( [ 2.12 ] ) , and whose solution is ( [ 2.14 ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we restrict the reconstruction to the phantom epoch , when the solution can be written as @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . using ( [ 3.6 ] )",
    ", the function @xmath80 takes the form @xmath81 as a function of time @xmath1 in the jordan frame .",
    "then , using ( [ 3.7 ] ) , the solution in the einstein frame is found t_e=-(t_s - t ) a_e(t_e)=  .",
    "[ 3.8 ] through the relation between the time coordinates in both frames , we see that while for the jordan frame there is a big rip singularity , at @xmath68 , this corresponds in the einstein frame to @xmath82 , so that the singularity is avoided , and there is no phantom epoch there . by analyzing the scale parameter in the einstein frame",
    ", we realize that it describes a de sitter universe , while in the jordan frame the universe was described by a phantom expansion . as a consequence",
    ", we have shown that a phantom universe in @xmath0 gravity may be thoroughly reconstructed as a quintessence - like model , where the phantom behavior is lost completely .",
    "this has been achieved in a fairly simple example and constitutes an interesting result .",
    "let us now explore the opposite way .",
    "in this case , a phantom scalar - tensor theory is given and it is @xmath0 gravity which is reconstructed . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , when a phantom scalar field is introduced , then the corresponding @xmath0 function  which is reconstructed , close to the big rip singularity , by means of a conformal transformation that deletes the kinetic term for the scalar field  is in general complex . as a consequence",
    ", there is no correspondence in modified gravity when a phantom scalar produces a big rip singularity .",
    "however , in our case we will analyze a scalar - tensor theory which includes a phantom fluid that is responsible for the phantom epoch and for the big rip singularity .",
    "in this situation a real @xmath0 gravity will be generically reconstructed , as we are going to see .",
    "the action that describes the scalar - tensor theory is s_e = d^4x  , [ 3.9 ] where @xmath83 is a coupling function and @xmath84 the lagrangian for the phantom fluid in the einstein frame . in our case , we consider a phantom fluid with constant eos , @xmath85 , with @xmath53 .",
    "the friedmann equations in this frame are written as h_e^2=(()^2+v()+()_phe )  , _",
    "e= -(()^2 + ( ) _ phe(1+w_ph ) )  .",
    "[ 3.10 ] to solve the above equations , it turns out to be very useful to redefine the scalar field as @xmath86 .",
    "then , for a given solution @xmath87 , the kinetic term for the scalar field can be written as follows ( ) = -  . [ 3.11 ] to reconstruct @xmath0 gravity , we perform a conformal transformation that deletes the kinetic term , namely g_e=^2 g _  , ^2=  . [ 3.12 ] note that for a phantom scalar field , that is defined by a negative kinetic term , the above conformal transformation would be complex , as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite and as will be shown below .",
    "thus , the reconstructed action would be complex , and no @xmath0 gravity could be recovered . by means of the above conformal transformation ,",
    "action ( [ 3.9 ] ) is given by s = d^4x  , [ 3.13 ] where @xmath88 is the lagrangian for the phantom fluid in the jordan frame , whose energy - momentum tensor is related with the one in the einstein frame by @xmath89 , and where we have chosen a coupling function @xmath90 , for simplicity . by varying now the action ( [ 3.13 ] ) with respect to @xmath71 , the scalar field equation",
    "is obtained r=^ ( 4 ^ 2 v ( ) v ( ) )  , [ 3.13a ] which can be solved as @xmath72 , so that by rewriting action ( [ 3.13 ] ) , the @xmath0 gravity picture result : f(r)=r-^ v ( )  . [ 3.14 ] hence , for some coupling quintessence theory described by action ( [ 3.9 ] ) , it is indeed possible to obtain a _ real _",
    "@xmath0 theory , by studying the system in the jordan frame through the conformal transformation ( [ 3.12 ] ) .    to demonstrate this reconstruction explicitly",
    ", an example will now be given .",
    "as we are interested in the case of a phantom epoch close to the big rip singularity , we will start from a solution in the einstein frame @xmath91 , and a scalar potential given by @xmath92 , with @xmath93 .",
    "then , the kinetic term ( [ 3.11 ] ) is written as ( ) ~  . [ 3.15 ] the solution in the jordan frame is calculated by performing the conformal transformation ( [ 3.12 ] ) ( t_s - t_e)=^1/(1k/2 )  a(t)~^-  , [ 3.16 ] where @xmath94 and @xmath53 .",
    "note that , in this case , we can construct two different solutions , and correspondingly two different @xmath0 models , depending on the sign selected in eq .",
    "( [ 3.12 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the big rip singularity is thereby transformed , depending on the case , into an initial singularity ( + ) , or into an infinity singularity(- ) . by using ( [ 3.13a ] ) and",
    "( [ 3.14 ] ) , the following function @xmath0 is recovered f(r)~r- ( ) ^  .

    "very interesting @xmath0 models crossing the phantom divide can also be constructed explicitly @xcite .",
    "the above reconstruction procedure , where we have taken the @xmath0 function of ( [ 2.1 ] ) , can be generalized to other types of modified gravity models ( for recent reviews see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we have seen in this paper that the @xmath0 model given by ( [ 2.1 ] ) , and where the @xmath0 fluid behaves as an effective cosmological constant , is able to reproduce the same behavior , at present time , as the @xmath95cdm model . on the other hand , this model gives rise to the accelerated expansion of the inflation epoch too , so that the natural next step to undertake with those models should be to study the complete cosmological history , in particular ( what is very important ) the explicit details for a grateful exit from inflation , what would demonstrate their actual potential .",
    "what is more , @xmath0 functions of this kind might even lead to a solution of the cosmological constant problem , by involving a relaxation mechanism of the cosmological constant , as was indicated in @xcite ( see also the very recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "the effective cosmological constant thus obtained could eventually adjust to its precise observable value .",
    "this issue is central and deserves further investigation .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the cosmological evolution when a phantom fluid is introduced that contributes to the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the @xmath0 function we have considered is the one given in ( [ 1.9 ] ) , which contributes as an effective cosmological constant at present time .",
    "the motivation for this case study comes , as it will be further explored , from the difficulty one encounters to construct _ viable _ @xmath0 functions which produce phantom epochs , and this has a representation in the scalar - tensor picture in the einstein frame .",
    "as recent observational data suggest ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , the effective eos parameter for dark energy is around @xmath47 , so that the phantom case is allowed  and actually favored by recent , extensive observations .",
