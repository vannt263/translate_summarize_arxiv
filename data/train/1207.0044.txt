    "h@xmath13 are quite different , favoring @xmath14 = 1 .",
    "the result is that while the largest ortho ",

    "the line ratio reaches specified value for a lower density of ortho ",

    "the difference , however , is only about a factor of 1.3 to 1.5 in density .",
    "the ortho to para h@xmath13 ratio ( opr ) is quite uncertain .",
    "if the molecular hydrogen is formed with its internal levels populated at a temperature comparable to the molecule s",
    "binding energy , the opr should just reflect the relative statistical weights of the two spin modifications , since their energy difference is so small in comparison . this would result in an opr equal to 3 . on",
    "the other hand , equilibration at the cloud temperature should result in a ratio determined by the j=1 to j= 0 energy difference .",
    "since this is equivalent to 171 k , the result is an opr close to zero for a dark cloud kinetic temperature of 10 k  15 k. observational results are difficult to obtain , and are mixed , but suggest that an opr @xmath1 1 is a reasonable upper limit even in moderately warm regions ( neufeld , melnick & harwit 1998 ) .",
    "this may be a reflection of timescales for interconversion of the spin modifications .",
    "due to the very modest difference between the ortho and para collision rates , even though one might have to consider opr between 0 and 1 , the excitation of 3n  is only very weakly dependent on this poorly  known quantity . in dark clouds there is evidence for enhanced molecular deuteration , which requires very low ortho h@xmath13 abundance ( flower , pineau des forts & walmsley 2006 ) . given the above considerations , we will adopt the para ",
    "h@xmath13 rates ( i.e. an opr = 0 ) for obtaining densities in the b213 filament .    our imprecise knowledge of the kinetic temperature results in an additional uncertainty .",
    "data suggests a kinetic temperature between 12 k and 15 k , but this may apply more to the outer portion of the filament , since the lower transitions of this species are very optically thick and do not really sample the interior of the filament .",
    "it is reasonable that the the inner portions in a region such as this with a h@xmath13 column density corresponding to @xmath1 10 mag of visual extinction will be significantly cooler ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ; shirley et al .",
    "thus , for the optically thin hc@xmath3n emission , a kinetic temperature of 10 k seems appropriate . in fig .",

    "the molecular column density is chosen so that all transitions are optically thin ; in this case the ratios for the peak and the integrated temperatures are the same .",

[ rat - tk],width=302 ]    other than the uncertainty in the knowledge of collision rates , the uncertainty in the derived density is dominated by the uncertainty in the derived optical depth for the j=2 - 1 transition .",
    "the uncertainty in the fitted optical depth is affected by both the rms noise , which is 0.09 k and 0.03 k per channel for tmc1c and b213 , respectively , and the line strength . for tmc1c ,",
    "the sigma for the derived optical depth of the main hyperfine component is 0.23 compared to its best fit value 0.47 .",

    "filamentary structures are not restricted to fluid simulations ( with or without magnetic field , with or without dominant turbulence ) ; filamentary structures are prevalent in cold dark matter cosmological simulations ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ) , where the most important physics are gravity and structure growth .    to determine the driving factor of structure formation in the star - forming ism",
    ", the measurement of physical parameters in addition to morphology is critical .",
    "the data presented here are a limited first step .",
    "one particular relevant regime of ism evolution is molecular cloud formation induced by colliding hi streams ( ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "1999 ) . a flattened structure ( sheet ) is expected at the shock front ( vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "the subsequent structure growth depends on the relative importance of different unstable modes , which in turn depend on the physical conditions . in an illustrative discussion by heitsch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the structures that become visible largely reflect the ratio between volume density and converging velocity .",
    "when the density is high , thermal instability dominates and the dense structures that grow tend to be contained near the shock front , maintaining a filamentary appearance .",
    "when the ratio of density to colliding velocity decreases , kelvin - helmholtz and nonlinear thin sheet instabilities grow faster and tend to produce structures perpendicular to the elongation of the shock front .",
    "we are not yet at a stage to differentiate among different simulations , for which the methods themselves are evolving rapidly .",
    "it is , however , tantalizing to describe the evolution of ism leading to star formation as the following sequence : sheet @xmath32 filament @xmath32 cores . a flattened structure ( sheet )",
    "can be produced by colliding streams or other shocks as discussed above .",
    "a self - gravitating sheet will preferentially fragment into filaments ( miyama , narita & hayashi 1987 ) .",
    "inutsuka and miyama ( 1992 ) carried out self - similar calculation of isothermal cylinder and derived a critical filament  line mass \" , consistent with that in ostriker ( 1964 ) , beyond which the filament is expected to fragment and collapse into cores .",
    "this last stage of filament  to  cores evolution seems to be emerging as a phenomenon often found in recent observational studies , such as hacar & tafalla ( 2011 ) and schmalzl et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    in observing multiple transitions of 3n  toward taurus filaments",
    ", we do not see any suggestions of a sheet extended along the line of sight .",
    "if a sheet had been present , it must have already evolved or dissipated .",
    "the line width and velocity gradient of 3n  gas are both small at around 0.3 km / s . at the @xmath2 10 k temperature of gas in the filament , this is marginally supersonic . for a sound speed of 0.127 km / s corresponding to a line width of 0.3 km / s fwhm ,",
    "the critical line mass is about 7.6 /pc . for b213",
    ", this corresponds to a column density of n(2 ) = 4@xmath4 10@xmath27 @xmath17 , somewhat smaller than the observed value , suggesting that b213 is susceptible to collapse / fragmentation to produce cores .",
    "the line width of 3n  in b213 filament is similar to that of 18o  in l1517 ( hacar & tafalla 2011 ) , while larger than that of 2h  that is observed in the same study .",
    "hacar & tafalla also found a subsonic velocity difference among 2h  cores contained in the l1517 filaments and were able to fit the radial profiles of 18o  emission using isothermal cylinders .",
    "these authors postulate a two step core formation processes including , first , a subsonic filament , and second , fragmentation  produced cores .",
    "the measured volume density and line of sight dimension of b213 are consistent with it being a cylinder - like ` true ' filament in which 3ntraces the gas in a manner similar to 18o  in l1517 .",
    "the internal motions of the b213 filament are still slightly supersonic , which could mean that b213 is at an earlier evolutionary stage than l1517 , having yet to go through the stage in which the line width drops and core formation begins .",
    "the volume density measurements and the velocity information presented in this paper will be of additional value when radiative transfer is added to various simulations and modeled spectral line profiles can be compared directly with those observed .",
    "the density measurements in this study fit into a developing picture of molecular cloud evolution from turbulent gas to coherent filaments to subsonic cores .",
    "we have determined the volume 2  densities along five lines of sight ( which include a total 6 distinct components ) in a prominent filament in taurus , b213 , to be on average @xmath30 .",
    "the density determinations are based on excitation calculations that fit the line ratio between 3n  10 - 9 and 3n  2 - 1 transitions .",
    "the clearly  resolved hyperfine components of the 2 - 1 transition enable us to determine the peak opacity of the 2 - 1 line to be smaller than 1.3 .",
    "the line of sight dimension of the dense portion of b213 filament is @xmath1 0.25 pc , comparable to the smaller plane  of  the  sky dimension of the filament , which is about 0.16 pc .",
    "these dimensions are both much smaller than the longer dimension of b213 , which is a few pc .",
    "the fwhm line wdith of 3n  is about 0.3 km / s , which is slightly supersonic .",
    "we conclude that b213 is likely a true filament , but that it has not yet formed dense cores throughout .",
