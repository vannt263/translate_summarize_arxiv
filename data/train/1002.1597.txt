    "nowadays , the study of high energy scattering is one of the most exciting topics in physics , and we have , as far we know , the exact theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which can describe , based on the perturbative calculation scheme , the hadron - hadron interactions at short distances .",
    "however , interactions at large distances ( near forward scattering ) can not be calculated even within perturbative approaches .",
    "proton - proton ( @xmath2 ) and antiproton - proton ( @xmath3 ) elastic scattering are the simplest processes not yet explained in terms of a pure qcd description .",
    "the absence of such a description allows empirical analyses based on models @xcite or almost - independent models ( some experimental data set possess theoretical bias ) @xcite whose main goal is to fit the available experimental data extracting useful information , contributing to the development of novel computational schemes .",
    "several phenomenological models for high energy scattering are based on general principles of the axiomatic quantum field theory ( aqft ) , such as unitarity and crossing - symmetry , and on derived results as analyticity , and have proven to be successful in understanding or predicting the behavior of the hadronic scattering amplitude .",
    "empirical parametrization for the total cross - section , differential cross - section , slope of the differential cross - section and others physical quantities have widely been used as a source of phenomenological model - independent indications of the experimental data behavior .",
    "these approaches must be seen as a first step or attempt toward a formally rigorous phenomenological model - independent description of high energy elastic hadron scattering , embodying a predictive character . moreover , important high energy theorems and bounds have been demonstrated in the last decades , providing rigorous formal constraints in the region of asymptotic energies , which can not be disregarded in any reliable formalism , mainly related with phenomenological model - independent approaches . of course",
    ", we must keep in mind that aqft is a mathematical framework for the treatment and interpretation of relativistic quantum field theories and , in general , not all formal results based on aqft results are satisfied by qcd .    in this work , we present a novel parametrization based on formal high energy bounds taken from aqft for the total cross - section of the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "specifically , we introduce a novel analytical parametrization for the total cross - section , inferred assuming some rigorous high energy bounds .",
    "the real part of the scattering amplitude is analytically evaluated through derivative dispersion relation .",
    "the crossing symmetry relates particle - particle and particle - antiparticle amplitudes .",
    "fits to @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross - section , @xmath0 parameter are performed and may lead to a predictive and phenomenological model - independent approach , able to describe quite well the bulk of the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we present some predictions for the total cross - section for the lhc run at @xmath4 , 10 , and 14 tev , for the future hc at @xmath5 , 100 , 200 and 500 tev and for the rhic experiment at @xmath6 and 500 gev .",
    "it is important to stress that the parametrization proposed here allows us to obtain , under some physical conditions , the whole scattering function ( beyond the forward direction ) .",
    "we intend to show these analyses elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the froissart - martin bound @xcite , jin - martin - cornille bound @xcite and the optical theorem are used to propose a novel parameterization for @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross - section and @xmath0 parameter using only four fit parameters to each scattering reaction . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we explicitly obtain the real part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude and the @xmath0 parameter . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we show the individual fit results for @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in section [ secsimult ]",
    "we show the simultaneous fit results for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "section [ secy ] presents a possible interpretation for the effective physical mechanism of this model comparing it with some models present in the literature . in section [ sec7 ]",
    "we present our final remarks with some criticism .",
    "the total cross - section is one of the most important physical observable in the elastic scattering .",
    "its energy dependence has been a focus of intense theoretical interest since the establishment of qcd as @xmath7 theory of strong interactions .",
    "however , at high energies there is no description based only on pure qcd formalism and the use of models with free fit parameters is the usual way to study @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic scattering . in this section one",
    "obtains a novel parametrization for the total cross - section based on well - established results taken from aqft .",
    "we start considering the scattering amplitude @xmath8 expressed as a function of two mandelstam variables in the center - of - mass system , usually the energy squared @xmath9 and the momentum transfer squared @xmath10 .",
    "we can write @xmath8 in terms of its real and imaginary parts as @xmath11    where the imaginary part of @xmath12 represents the absorption in the scattering process and usually is related to the real part by dispersion relation ( integral or derivative ) that analytically connects @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic scattering through crossing property . therefore , if we know @xmath13 , then we are able to compute analytically the whole scattering amplitude ( at @xmath14 ) .",
    "the main goal of this section is to propose @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross - section considering high energy bounds from formal results of the aqft .",
    "a fundamental result derived from unitarity and analyticity asserts that high energy total cross - sections for the hadronic forward elastic scattering ( at @xmath14 ) should be bounded according to froissart - martin bound @xcite @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the total cross - section of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath17 is some energy initial value .",
    "henceforth , we shall adopt @xmath18 gev@xmath19 .",
    "this bound refers to an energy dependence of the total cross - section rising no more rapidly than @xmath20 . as a remark , unfortunately , at present day we can not be unambiguously discriminate between asymptotic fits of @xmath21 and @xmath22 using high energy data @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", cornille @xcite improving the result of jin and martin @xcite proved the asymptotic lower bound @xmath23    using both formal results ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) we propose the following parametrization for the total cross - section    @xmath24    @xmath25    the first term in the right hand side of ( [ pp ] ) and ( [ pbp ] ) will be responsible for the description of the data at low energies .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 will be slightly different and at very high energies both terms must vanish .",
    "yet , @xmath30 and @xmath31 also has a role at low energies allowing a more accurate description of the low energy data .",
    "nevertheless , the second term in the right hand side of both parameterizations will be the leading one at high energies . using the pomeranchuk theorem , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 must tend to the same numerical value .    as seen above , in the fitting process for the total cross - section data we expect @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 , and therefore , @xmath36 and @xmath37 indicating the saturation of the froissart - martin bound .",
    "however , at the present day energy scale , we do not expect @xmath38 and so even really small values of @xmath30 will give a slow increase with @xmath9 for the total cross - section when compared with the `` full '' froissart - martin bound .",
    "one consider here the @xmath30-parameter as some kind of `` correction term '' in the froissart - martin bound at low energies and it may represents some physical mechanisms that avoid the total cross - section saturation . as mentioned above , @xmath30 may be treated as a correction in the froissart - martin bound at low energy . however , at ( finite ) high energies all the second term in the right hand side of ( [ pp ] ) and ( [ pbp ] ) will behave as some power of @xmath9 @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a convenient constant and @xmath41 the effective index .    in order to apply the results obtained above to analyze the total cross - section data",
    ", we notice the important result assuring that if the froissart - martin is reached then the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross - section goes as @xcite @xmath42    which means that the difference can increases at most as @xmath21 and even in this case , @xmath43    as @xmath44 .",
    "this is the revised version of the pomeranchuk theorem and in order to obey this formal result , we must impose the following constraints @xmath45    nevertheless , the energies achieved in the collision processes allow to release these constraints and therefore , as a first step , we adopt in the fitting procedure four independent parameters to @xmath2 and four to @xmath3 .",
    "in this section , we shall obtain the real part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "in particular , we obtain @xmath46 , the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude in the high energy domain .",
    "the optical theorem connects the total cross - section to imaginary part of the elastic scattering at @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude may be connected to the real part using dispersion relation one concludes that forward elastic scattering amplitude possess the same free parameters , except for the free - parameters coming from the subtraction terms of the dispersion relation , of the total cross - section .",
    "connections between real and imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude have been widely investigated by dispersion relation in both integral and derivative forms ( we use here the derivative form ) .",
    "several papers have been devoted to calculations of the real parts of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 forward scattering amplitude , using a wide variety of dispersion relations and different representations for the energy dependence of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at @xmath47 . here , to obtain the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude , we use the approach adopted in @xcite .",
    "we define two auxiliary functions ( crossing between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and relate these functions with the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are convenient amplitudes . in the forward direction , the derivative dispersion relation for even ( + ) and odd ( - )",
    "amplitudes are expressed in terms of a tangent operator and in the case of one subtraction ( equal to two subtractions in the even case ) they are given by @xcite @xmath53 \\frac{\\mathrm{im}f_+(s,0)}{s},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath54 \\frac{\\mathrm{im}f_-(s,0)}{s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , bronzan , kane and sukhatme @xcite obtained derivative dispersion relations ( without subtraction constant ) using an integration parameter @xmath55 .",

    "the odd case of kang and nicolescu can be obtained from vila and menon expressions replacing @xmath61 \\rightarrow -\\cot\\left[\\frac{\\textstyle \\pi}{\\textstyle 2\\rule{0pt}{8.5pt}}\\frac{\\textstyle d}{\\textstyle d\\ln s\\rule{0pt}{8.5pt}}\\right]$ ] and expanding the series around the origin in vila and menon derivative dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , results of vila and menon are equivalent to bronzan , kane and sukhatme considering the particular case @xmath60 .",
    "it is important to stress that replacement @xmath61 \\rightarrow -\\cot\\left[\\frac{\\textstyle \\pi}{\\textstyle 2\\rule{0pt}{8.5pt}}\\frac{\\textstyle d}{\\textstyle d\\ln s\\rule{0pt}{8.5pt}}\\right]$ ] may present some theoretical flow .",
    "as known , the first term of the @xmath62 expansion presents the application of the inverse of the derivative operator .",
    "mathematically speaking , let @xmath63 a linear operator .",
    "its inverse , @xmath64 , is by definition ( @xmath65 is a non - zero analytic function ) @xmath66=\\pi^{-1}[\\pi{h(x)}]=h(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    furthermore , @xmath64 is also linear @xcite . of course , we consider @xmath67 as an element of a linear space with a well - defined norm . in the context of the operatorial algebra ,",
    "there exist @xmath64 if and only if to @xmath68 @xmath69    to the especific case where @xmath70 is always possible obtain @xmath71 to satisfy the above result .",
    "however , we must take in to account the possible divergence result , i.e. , @xmath72    and therefore @xmath73 .",
    "the above result may be viewed as a possible limitation to the functional form of the imaginary part of the forward amplitude : it can not be constant in @xmath74 .",
    "of course , this result is valid only if the formal procedure presented above is correct .",
    "it has also been demonstrated by fischer and kol @xcite that at high energies the above even tangent operator can be replaced by its first order expansion .",
    "the odd representation also can be replaced by its first term @xcite by using the notation of kang and nicolescu .",
    "however , vila and menon and kang and nicolescu representations are equivalent by the transformation showed above .",
    "therefore , we retain here , for the sake of simplicity , only the first term of tangent series expansion in the vila and menon representation for both even and odd derivative dispersion relations .",
    "@xmath75    @xmath76    this approach was recently used presenting good statistical results @xcite .",
    "of course , other terms of the tangent series expansion could be considered as perturbations of the first ( leading ) term .",
    "the real part of the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath77    the most general versions of local quantum field theory lead to proving dispersion relation and , more generally , analyticity properties in two variables in a rather large domain , if one makes use of the positivity properties of the absorptive part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "empirically , over many years , dispersion relation had always been consistent with measured data for energies reached by fixed target machines ( e.g. pion nucleon scattering ) or colliders ( isr and @xmath78 colliders ) .",
    "therefore , considering the above formalism we obtain ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) @xmath79+\\frac{\\pi}{4}[\\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{pp}-\\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{\\bar{p}p}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath80-\\frac{\\pi}{4}[\\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{pp}-\\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{\\bar{p}p}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the crossing property allows the simultaneous analysis to @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering amplitude . notice that @xmath2 and @xmath3 forward scattering amplitudes interact with each to other by means the crossing property .    at high energies",
    "is expected that the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude dominate the real part , i.e. , the absorptive part will represents the whole scattering amplitude . therefore , a simple measure of how fast the imaginary part increases is given by @xmath0 , the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude in the high energy domain @xmath81    and using ( [ pp ] ) , ( [ pbp ] ) , ( [ jac7 ] ) and ( [ jac8 ] ) we can explicitly write @xmath46 as ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) @xmath82+\\frac{\\textstyle \\pi}{\\textstyle 4\\rule{0pt}{8.5pt}}[\\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{pp}- \\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{\\bar{p}p } ] } { \\frac{\\textstyle \\delta\\rule{0pt}{8.75pt}}{\\textstyle s^{6+\\gamma}\\rule{0pt}{8.75pt } } + \\frac{\\textstyle \\pi\\beta\\rule{0pt}{8.75pt}}{\\textstyle \\sqrt{2}m_{\\pi}^2s^{\\alpha}\\rule{0pt}{8.75pt } } \\ln^2s},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath83-\\frac{\\textstyle \\pi}{\\textstyle 4\\rule{0pt}{8.5pt}}[\\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{pp}- \\sigma_{\\footnotesize\\mbox{tot}}^{\\bar{p}p } ] } { \\frac{\\textstyle \\bar{\\delta}\\rule{0pt}{8.75pt}}{\\textstyle s^{6+\\bar{\\gamma}}\\rule{0pt}{9.25pt } } + \\frac{\\textstyle \\pi\\bar{\\beta}\\rule{0pt}{8.75pt}}{\\textstyle \\sqrt{2}m_{\\pi}^2s^{\\bar{\\alpha}}\\rule{0pt}{9.25pt } } \\ln^2s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the only free parameter in the above results is the subtraction constant @xmath84 .",

    "in this section , we compare the possible physical description of our model with some models present in the literature .",
    "there are several models but for the sake of the simplicity , we restrict ourselves to three models only .",
    "the first one is the famous and successful donnachie - landshoff model @xcite based on a very simple parametrization structure evolving the exchange of reggeons and pomerons trajectories .",
    "the second one is the kharzeev - levin model @xcite based on n=4 super - symmetric yang - mills theory and considering the contribution of d - instantons for multiparticle production . finally , the godbole - grau - pancheri - srivastava model @xcite based on minijet contributions to the total cross - section .",
    "one of the most successful models is the donnachie - landshoff ( dl ) parametrization @xcite @xmath177    where @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 are fit parameters .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of the above expressions ( @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) is associated with the pomeron contribution and has a common value to both @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross - section because the pomeron carries the quantum number of the vacuum and can not distinguish particles and antiparticles . the second term ( @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 )",
    "is associated with the reggeon trajectory , and it may be different to particles and antiparticles at low @xmath9 .",
    "this term may be identified as resulting from @xmath0 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 exchange , for example . at @xmath191 ,",
    "the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross - section parametrization can increases at most as @xmath21",
    ". however , the difference may vanish if @xmath192 and , in any case , the ratio between both total cross sections tends to 1 as stated by the pomeranchuk theorem .",
    "the dl model possesses clearly two regimes . roughly speaking , at low energy the second term at the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ dl ] ) is the leading one ( the reggeon exchange dominates ) and at high energy regime , the first term will be the leading one ( the pomeron exchange dominates ) .",
    "this picture is quite similar to our model where the first term of the right hand side of ( [ pp ] ) and ( [ pbp ] ) is the sub - leading one and may be associated to the exchange of a reggeon trajectory with intercept @xmath193 .    on the other hand , using ( [ pomeron ] ) we may connect ( at high energies ) the behavior of the leading term of our model with the exchange of a pomeron trajectory .",
    "adopting @xmath194 as obtained in the dl model we obtain @xmath195 and therefore , @xmath196 .",
    "this value is slightly above 1 and may leads to the violation of the froissart - martin bound , but it does not occur for momenta lower than planck scale . in this way , the pomeron exchange mechanism may ensures the preservation of unitarity .",
    "however , comparisons done above are not exactly correct . in our model , at low energies , reggeon and pomeron trajectories interacts with each other mixing the intercept contributions .",
    "therefore , the reggeon intercepts showed here present pomeron contributions . indeed , @xmath189 trajectory , for example , has the quantum number of the vacuum as the pomeron .",
    "there may be contributions from pomerons at low energies , preventing the complete separation between pomerons and reggeons .",
    "we expect , at high energies , the divergence of reggeon and pomeron trajectories from each other . then , the influence of reggeons will ceases and only the pomeron exchange will be the main physical mechanism restoring the validity of pomeranchuk theorem .      the kharzeev - levin ( kl ) model @xcite is based on the super - symmetric yang - mills theory in n=4 ( n=4 sym ) . considering contributions of d - instantons in @xmath197 bulk space",
    ", they argue that d - instantons coupled to dilatons and axions are responsible for multiparticle production in strongly coupled n=4 sym . as a consequence , the cross - section increases with the energy @xmath198    where @xmath199 depends on the convenient choice of parameters @xcite .",
    "this approach is interesting since it suggests that topological effects may be important in high energy collisions .",
    "furthermore , they argue that the weakly coupled graviton generates the elastic amplitude and the correspondent part of the total cross - section . on the other hand , d - instanton induced interactions of dilatons and axions are responsible for the multiparticle production processes .",
    "this formalism predicts that the cross - section will increase with the energy due to d - instanton mechanism .",
    "this mechanism is induced by interactions of dilatons and axions responsible for the multiparticle production process .",
    "the pomeron intercepts predicted in kl model depends on the value of @xmath199 ( and @xmath200 ) .",
    "they found @xmath201 and consequently , the slope @xmath202 gev@xmath203 .",
    "however , this value of @xmath199 may imply in a strong unitarisation scheme to restore the froissart - martin bound . as shown above",
    ", the pomeron exchange may be the main mechanism responsible for restore the unitarisation .",
    "indeed , they obtain a very high pomeron intercept , possibly indicating the exchange of a new soft pomeron trajectory family ( @xmath199 is not unique ) .",
    "the model proposed here possesses a very smooth increase ( at high energies ) when compared with the standard theoretical result @xmath204 .",
    "the kl model may explains these differences in the behaviors by the mechanism of multiparticle production : at high energies the multiparticle mechanism acts , increasing the hadron cross - section and when the saturation limit approaches the pomeron exchange has become physically important restoring the unitarity scheme turning the increase of the total cross - section smooth as obtained .",
    "moreover , we may suppose a mixed state `` reggeon+pomeron '' as being the responsible for the observed differences between @xmath2 and @xmath3 total cross - section .",
    "the study of qcd minijet contribution is the main goal of the godbole - grau - pancheri - srivastava ( ggps ) model @xcite .",
    "this model includes a re - summation of soft gluon radiation which they argue it is necessary to tame the fast high energy rise typical of a purely perturbative minijet model .",
    "the minijet formalism predicts a very fast rise to @xmath205 at high energies . to restore the total cross - section they suppose that soft gluon emissions from the colliding partons are the physical attenuation mechanism . to restore the froissart - martin bound",
    ", they obtain a `` new '' formulation of the froissart - martin bound @xmath206    where @xmath181 fixes the asymptotic rise and @xmath207 modulates the infrared behavior of @xmath208 @xcite .",
    "pomeron exchange is believed to be the exchange of a system of gluons .",
    "therefore ( ultimately ) , the pomeron exchange will be the froissart - martin bound restoration mechanism as in the kl model .",
    "as seen above , the pomeron exchange has a very important role if we want to understand the taming mechanism behind no saturation effect in our model .",
    "the model proposed here to describe the hadron - hadron total cross - section and the @xmath0 parameter is basically based on two rigorously bounds obtained in the framework of aqft .",
    "namely , the froissart - martin bound and jin - martin - cornille bound .",
    "roughly speaking , in this model the like - froissart - martin bound will control the high energy behavior of the total cross - section , and like - jin - martin - cornille bound will defines its behavior at low energies .",
    "however , the analysis of our model is not so simple , since we suppose an attenuation mechanism in the froissart - martin bound @xmath209 which mix these two bounds , especially at low energies .",
    "the statistical description of @xmath129 and @xmath0 experimental data is acceptable .",
    "the quality of some simultaneous fits is better than that for kang - nicolescu model fit as well as for donnachie - landshoff fit of @xmath2 and @xmath3 experimental data .",
    "the qualities of the fits obtained in this work for wide energy domains are closer to the best fit qualities previously observed for several processes in the framework of the model with a different number of poles .",
    "therefore , based on this statistical fact , it is possible perform predictions in the energy variable and the results can be compared with others present in some models and parameterizations in available literature .",
    "results viewed here shown some agreement among themselves .",
    "comparisons with some models may allow some physical understanding of what is happening here . in the context of dl model",
    ", we may understand the the index in the low energy term of our model as representing a reggeon exchange trajectory , and the index in the high energy term - as a pomeron exchange trajectory . yet",
    ", the picture viewed here seems to be not so simple .",
    "the mixed description proposed , especially at low energies , prevents the identification of each index contribution separately ( or each trajectory separately ) and , therefore , we can not treat this low energy term as being a pure reggeon exchange .",
    "in the context of kl and ggps models , the pomeron exchange is the responsible for the attenuation of the rise of the total cross - section .",
    "however , in both models the saturation of the total cross - section is quickly reached and therefore , it is necessary the exchange of not only one pomeron but a whole family . in our model , this attenuation mechanism may be explained by the interaction of pomerons and reggeons that tames the rise of the total cross - section and this mixed state of index ( trajectories ) may be responsible for the observed differences between @xmath2 and @xmath3 behaviors . on the other hand , the model presented here does not saturate the total cross - section .",
    "then , we may suppose that this is due to the exchange of more than only one pomeron trajectory since the increase of experimental data set in the fit procedures may give rise to different values of the effective index @xmath41 and each value may represent a novel pomeron trajectory .",
    "therefore , novel experimental results to total cross section can be added to the original data set allowing more precise values to the effective index @xmath41 through fit procedures .",
    "these trajectories may tend to a limiting value , i.e , @xmath210 where @xmath211 represents a pomeron trajectory and @xmath212 represents the limiting trajectory ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "if this pomeron trajectory limit exist it may represent a definite ( or not , since a new physical attenuation mechanism may be discovered ) bound to the rise of total cross section .",
    "this behavior at very high energies is one of the puzzles to be solved at the future hc because the applied mechanisms used to tame its very fast rise , we hope , will be verified .",
