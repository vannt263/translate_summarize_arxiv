    "quantum entanglement is an important physical phenomenon in which the quantum states of several objects can not be described independently , even if the objects are spatially separated .",
    "quantum entanglement is used in different research areas @xcite . in quantum information theory entangled states are a valuable source of processing the information .",
    "quantum entanglement also plays an important role in properties of strongly correlated many - body systems and in collective phenomena such as quantum phase transitions . in quantum gravity",
    "the entanglement may be a key for understanding the mystery of the black hole entropy .",
    "the entanglement can be quantified by an entropy .",
    "one can define it as the measure of the information about quantum states which is lost when these states can not be observed . in many - body systems , which are the subject of the present work , `` observable '' and `` unobservable '' states can be located in different regions .",
    "consider , for instance , a lattice of spins being in a quantum state characterized by a density matrix @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that the lattice is divided into regions @xmath3 and @xmath4 with a common boundary @xmath5 .",
    "the entanglement between the two regions can be described by the reduced density matrix @xmath6 where the trace is taken over the states of spin operators at the lattice sites in the region @xmath3 .",
    "the entanglement entropy in the region @xmath4 is defined as the von neumann entropy @xmath7 analogously one can define the entanglement entropy @xmath8 in the region @xmath3 by tracing the density matrix over the states located in the region @xmath4 .",
    "if the system is in a pure state @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 , it is not difficult to show that @xmath11 , see @xcite .",
    "it has been observed long ago @xcite,@xcite ( see also recent works @xcite , @xcite ) , that in lattice models representing a discrete version of a relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) the ground state entanglement entropy in the leading order is proportional to the area @xmath12 of @xmath5 , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the lattice spacing and @xmath15 is the number of spacetimes dimensions ( it is assumed that @xmath16 ) .",
    "this geometrical property of @xmath17 follows from the fact that field excitations in different regions are correlated across the boundary .",
    "if @xmath14 is identified with the planck length @xmath18 , ( [ i1 ] ) looks very similar to the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the area surface of the black hole horizon and @xmath1 is the newton constant , @xmath21 .",
    "the similarity of the two entropies suggests that @xmath22 may be an entanglement entropy , as was first pointed out in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an external observer , who is at rest with respect to a black hole , never sees what happens inside the horizon .",
    "because the observer perceives the vacuum excitations in a mixed state it is natural to assume that @xmath22 measures the loss of the information inside the horizon .",
    "the reduced density matrix for a black hole is thermal @xcite .",
    "thus , the entanglement entropy coincides with the entropy of a thermal atmosphere around the black hole horizon ( see @xcite for a review of different interpretations of @xmath22 in terms of the entropy of quantum excitations ) . however , relation between @xmath22 and the entropy of entanglement ( or thermal entropy ) is non - trivial because @xmath17 is divergent . in the lattice regularization ( [ i1 ] )",
    "diverges in the continuum limit when @xmath23 .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite , @xcite that the divergences in @xmath17 are the standard ultraviolet divergences .",
    "if the entropy of thermal atmosphere is considered as a quantum correction to @xmath22 the divergences can be eliminated in the course of renormalization of the gravitational coupling .    a deep connection between the divergences in @xmath17 and the divergences in the quantum effective action has been established latter for different field species at the one - loop level @xcite .",
    "this connection is very important .",
    "suppose , following the original idea by sakharov @xcite , that the einstein action is entirely induced by quantum effects of some underlying fundamental theory . because the newton constant in this case has a pure quantum origin , so does the entropy @xmath22 .",
    "the hypothesis is that the entropy of a black hole in such a theory is an entanglement entropy of fundamental quantum excitations which induce low - energy gravity dynamics @xcite@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of generation of the black hole entropy in induced gravity may be quite general and , in particular , it can be realized in string theory @xcite . in string theory",
    "the low - energy effective gravity action appears from the tree - level diagrams of closed strings . from the point of view of open strings these are one - loop diagrams .",
    "thus , the gravity action as well as the bekenstein - hawking entropy can be interpreted as a pure loop effect .",
    "another argument in favour of entanglement interpretation of black hole entropy comes from analysis of string theory on asymptotically anti - de sitter backgrounds and its duality to a conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to look at these results from a different perspective .",
    "suppose the underlying fundamental theory of quantum gravity is known .",
    "this can be a string@xmath15-brane theory or some other theory which correctly describes the observable particle physics and gravitational effects .",
    "consider a low - energy limit of this theory and the entanglement entropy @xmath17 in the ground state for partition of the system in minkowsky spacetime by a plane .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath17 measures entanglement of all genuine microscopical degrees of freedom of the fundamental theory ( which may not coincide with the low - energy fields ) .",
    "we call such quantity the _ fundamental entanglement entropy_.    because the space is infinite it is convenient to discuss the density of @xmath17 per unit area",
    ". let us denote this quantity by @xmath24 .",
    "we make a conjecture that the density of the fundamental entanglement entropy is finite and is given precisely by the relation @xmath25 where @xmath1 is the newton constant in the low - energy gravity sector of the theory .",
    "the conjecture is based on the above mentioned arguments :    \\i ) in a fundamental theory the cutoff parameter @xmath14 in ( [ i1 ] ) should be of the order of the planck length ;    \\ii ) there are evidences that the bekenstein - hawking entropy ( [ i2 ] ) is the entanglement entropy for partition of the system by the horizon .    in what follows",
    "we discuss a more formal argument in favour of ( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "it is based on the observation that the black hole entropy and the entropy of entanglement are derived in a unique way from the effective gravity action .",
    "relation ( [ i3 ] ) has a number of interesting consequences .",
    "one of them is that the definition of @xmath1 becomes not only the subject of gravitational physics .",
    "the flat space entanglement is an alternative source of information about the newton constant .",
    "( in a certain sense the situation with different definitions of @xmath1 can be compared with `` gravitational '' and the `` inertional '' notions of the mass . )    in this paper we pay attention to the fact that relation ( [ i3 ] ) can be used to study the properties of the gravitational coupling by carrying the computations of the entanglement entropy in condensed matter systems .",
    "there are higher - dimensional condensed matter systems which near a critical point corresponding to a second order phase transition are described by relativistic qft s which contain massive fields .",
    "the class of ising models is one of such examples .",
    "the qft s in these systems are analogous to low - energy limit of the fundamental theory .",
    "the relativistic covariance guarantees that the entanglement entropy density in the near - critical regime determines an effective gravitational coupling by the same equation as eq .",
    "( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "the lattice spacing in the underlying theory serves as a cutoff .",
    "hence the entanglement entropy is finite and can be calculated by using analytical and numerical methods .",
    "this enables one to pose different questions about properties of @xmath1 and try to find the answers in gravity analogs .",
    "the rest part of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the entanglement entropy in relativistic qft s .",
    "the section starts with discussion of one - dimensional spin models which serve as an illustration .",
    "we then establish connection between the entanglement entropy @xmath17 in relativistic qft s and the effective gravity action , and use methods of the spectral geometry for derivation of @xmath17 . by studying the theories in a cubic region",
    "we find a geometric form of @xmath17 in different dimensions , at zero and high temperatures .",
    "we pay a special attention at boundary effects .",
    "our result for the ground state entanglement in four - dimensional space - times looks as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath12 is the area of the separating surface @xmath5 and @xmath27 is the length of the boundary of @xmath5 . the last term in @xmath17 has a topological form .",
    "it depends on the number @xmath28 of sharp corners ( vertexes ) of the boundary of @xmath5 and does not change under smooth deformations of @xmath5 .",
    "calculation of the subleading terms in ( [ main ] ) is the new result .",
    "relation of @xmath17 to the bekenstein - hawking entropy in induced gravity models in four dimensions is discussed in section iii .",
    "we also discuss the concept of gravity analogs and possible models which can be used to study properties of the gravitational coupling on the base of relation ( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "there are several topics which can be pursued by using simulations in the new class of gravity analogs .",
    "some of them such as the renormalization group behavior of @xmath1 , the universality of the low - energy physics and the statistical meaning of the bekenstein - hawking entropy are listed in section iv .",
    "we begin with discussion of the properties of the entanglement entropy in one - dimensional spin chains .",
    "consider as a simplest example the entanglement entropy for a block of spins in the ising model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of spins and @xmath31 are the pauli matrices .",
    "parameter @xmath32 is the strength of external magnetic field . at zero temperature",
    "the ising chain has a second order phase transition at the critical value @xmath33 .",
    "as is known , there is a unitary transformation ( the jordan - wigner transformation ) which maps the spin models like ( [ 6 ] ) to one - dimensional models with two spinless fermions .",
    "this transformation can be used to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "the entanglement entropy can be investigated for the ground state when the chain is separated into two blocks of contiguous spins of equal sizes @xmath34 .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 is fixed and @xmath30 varies ( @xmath30 is much larger than the correlation length ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath17 has been studied in two regimes @xcite . in the off - critical regime ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 , the entropy at large @xmath30 reaches the saturation value @xmath37 in the critical regime , @xmath33 , the entropy does not reach the saturation and behaves at large @xmath30 as @xmath38 the explanation of these results is based on the fact that in the continuous limit , @xmath39 , the ising model near the critical point corresponds to a quantum field theory with two fermion fields whose mass @xmath40 ( or the inverse correlation length @xmath41 ) is monotonically related to @xmath42 . in the critical regime @xmath40 vanishes and one has a conformal field theory with two massless fermions each having the central charge @xmath43 .    formulae ( [ r1 ] ) , ( [ r2 ] ) are quite general .",
    "they have been verified in other exactly solvable one - dimensional statistical models ( xxz , xy and other models ) which generalize the izing chain ( [ 6 ] ) , see @xcite@xcite and a review of results in @xcite . to discuss the continuum limit in lattice models",
    "it is convenient to introduce the lattice spacing @xmath14 .",
    "then the number of spins @xmath30 defines the size of the system @xmath44 . in the systems separated into two equal parts the entropy at the critical points behaves as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a total central charge of the corresponding effective two - dimensional conformal theory . near the critical point the entropy behaves as @xmath47 where @xmath40 is the corresponding inverse correlation length . from the point of view of qft @xmath14",
    "is the ultraviolet cutoff parameter .",
    "there are different ways to derive ( [ r3 ] ) , ( [ r4 ] ) by qft methods .",
    "our purpose is to show how it can be done by using the effective action approach .",
    "we first start with a theory in a flat spacetime with arbitrary number of dimensions @xmath15 and then focus on theories in @xmath48 , and 4 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath68 the space where the field configurations @xmath50 are given .",
    "it is easy to see how @xmath68 looks in two dimensions .",
    "it is a cylinder ( see the upper picture on fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) with coordinates @xmath69 and a cut parallel to its axis , the length of the cut is equal to the length of the interval @xmath4 .",
    "the field takes values @xmath53 , @xmath70 on the lower and upper sides of the cut , respectively . in higher dimensions",
    "the cut is a @xmath71-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "if the parameter @xmath72 in ( [ 11 ] ) is positive and integer the matrix elements of the operator @xmath73 can be represented by integral ( [ 12 ] ) where field variables are defined on a space @xmath74 which is obtained by gluing @xmath72 copies of @xmath68 along the cuts .",
    "@xmath74 still has a single cut which disappears when one takes the trace , @xmath75 .",

    "the boundary @xmath83 of @xmath76 consists of @xmath84 circles , each of which has a vanishing extrinsic curvature @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the integral of the scalar curvature @xmath86 for @xmath76 should be non - trivial for @xmath87 , @xmath88 the non - zero value of the integral is ensured by the conical singularity .",

    ". the effective action of the field can be found by using ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the heat kernel operator now has the following asymptotic ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath226 @xmath227 where @xmath228 , @xmath86 is the scalar curvature of @xmath224 , @xmath72 takes non - negative integer values .",
    "the higher coefficients are integrals of powers of the riemann tensor and its derivatives .",
    "we consider theory in @xmath145 . if the curvature radius of @xmath224 is much larger than @xmath153 on can proceed as in section ii.d and get @xmath229 @xmath230 @xmath231\\simeq\\ ] ] @xmath232 in the last line all terms related to @xmath233 were omitted .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ in-3 ] ) coincides with the classical einstein - hilbert action where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the induced newton and cosmological constants , correspondingly , @xmath236 @xmath237 the constant @xmath234 has the correct order of magnitude if the cutoff parameter @xmath14 is of the order of the planck length .    by comparing ( [ 27 ] ) with ( [ s4 ] )",
    "we conclude that , in accord with the hypothesis ( [ i3 ] ) , the induced newton constant in this simple model and the entanglement entropy of the system in the flat space - time in a cube are related as @xmath238 here @xmath146 is the area of the separation surface .",
    "the result holds when the size of the cube is sufficiently large .",
    "the reason why ( [ in-5 ] ) takes place is because the conical space possesses a curvature concentrated at the tip .",
    "let us consider the heat kernel coefficient @xmath239 , eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , for the theory on @xmath119 and compare it with @xmath240 in ( [ in-2 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath97 in ( [ a1 ] ) is close to @xmath241 then @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the `` curvature '' of @xmath119 concentrated at conical singularities on the hypersurface @xmath89 .",
    "notation `` b.t . '' stands for boundary terms which are irrelevant for the computation of the entropy .",
    "therefore , the coefficients @xmath239 and @xmath240 have the same geometrical form in this limit .",
    "the similarity of the heat kernel coefficients on smooth manifolds and manifolds with conical singularities at small angle deficits is a quite general property .",
    "if the components of the riemann tensor are treated at the conical singularities as distributions @xcite the coincidence holds also for higher heat kernel coefficients and for different field species @xcite",
    ".    it should be noted that ( [ in-5 ] ) does not hold for theories with fields which have non - minimal couplings to the curvature .",
    "a typical example is the scalar theory with the wave operator @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is a constant and @xmath86 is the scalar curvature .",
    "the coefficient @xmath239 does not depend on @xmath245 because , by the construction of the effective action @xmath93 in section ii.b , the wave operator on @xmath119 coincides with the laplacian @xmath185 .",
    "however , the coupling changes the heat kernel coefficients on curved manifolds .",
    "in particular , the multiplier @xmath246 in @xmath240 in ( [ in-2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath247 .",
    "it is still an open question whether the entanglement entropy in a physical theory depends on the non - minimal couplings .",
    "the answer to it may be related to the procedure of the measurements of the energy ( a discussion of the topic can be found in @xcite ) . in what follows we consider theories without non - minimal couplings .",
    "it is natural to suggest that a fundamental gravity theory and a simple model with a cutoff considered in the previous section share two features : i ) in the both cases the low - energy gravity sector is a pure effective theory and equations for the metric tensor are determined entirely by the polarization properties of the physical vacuum ; ii ) the theories do not have a problem of the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the string theory which is considered as one of the candidates to the role of the fundamental theory has these features .",
    "the second property ensures that the induced newton coupling @xmath1 is finite and can be expressed in terms of microscopical parameters .",
    "if the non - minimal couplings are absent @xmath1 can be derived from the ground state entanglement in a flat spacetime by using ( [ in-5 ] ) .    to get more intuition about quantum gravity it makes sense to study other models where the effective newton coupling can be calculated with the help of ( [ in-5 ] ) .",
    "one of the possibilities is to consider condensed matter systems which are higher - dimensional generalizations of spin chains discussed in section ii.a .",
    "the requirements to the models are : 1 ) the models are lattice theories ; 2 ) they have critical points which correspond to second order phase transitions ; 3 ) near the critical points the models are described by relativistic qft s with massive fields .    the cutoff in this type of models is the lattice spacing .",
    "the entanglement entropy is finite and it can be computed numerically .",
    "the third requirement guarantees that in the near critical regime one can use results of section ii.d to get the leading asymptotic of the entropy .",
    "one can use for this purpose an effective qft ( not the underlying lattice theory itself ) .",
    "then the density of the entropy per unit area yields the induced gravitational coupling ( relation ( [ in-5 ] ) ) .",
    "one of examples of such systems are higher - dimensional ising models which are known to be equivalent in the critical regime to scalar field theories with self - interactions @xcite .",
    "the models are also interesting for other reasons .",
    "the behavior of the most part of known second - order phase transitions is equivalent at the critical point to a three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising model @xcite .",
    "there are also indications that ising models can be represented as theories of random ( hyper ) surfaces .",
    "in particular , as was conjectured in @xcite near the point of the second order phase transition the 3d ising model might be equivalent to a non - critical fermionic string theory .",
    "the two - dimensional ising model is exactly solvable .",
    "the reduced density matrix for the ground state entanglement can be diagonalized .",
    "this property significantly simplifies computations of the entropy . in higher dimensions exactly solvable",
    "ising models are not known .",
    "thus , one has to rely on numerical methods .",
    "it should be noted that the role of condensed matter systems as gravity analogs is known for many years but in a different context : to study quantum effects in the external gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "one of such effects is the hawking radiation . under certain conditions sound waves in a liquid helium or in bose - einstein condensates",
    "behave as scalar excitations propagating in an effective curved background with a metric similar to that near a black hole horizon ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us emphasize that because we are interested only in the behavior of the newton coupling we do not need to introduce any metric ( or its analog ) in the condensed matter system . to determine the coupling it is sufficient to study the response of the effective action in flat space to introduction of conical singularity",
    "the knowledge of entanglement entropy as a function of parameters of the theory can be used to find renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the induced newton constant .",
    "this information is important for understanding the behaviour of gravitational interactions at different scales .",
    "consider as an illustration a one - dimensional spin chain .",
    "it has a compact momentum space with the radius @xmath248 determined by the lattice spacing @xmath14 .",
    "the wilson rg transformation implies integration over high - energy modes with momenta in the interval @xmath249 ( with @xmath250 ) followed by rescaling , @xmath251 to @xmath252 . as a result one",
    "gets a theory with larger masses . for the ising model ( [ 6 ] ) with @xmath253 this is equivalent to increasing the difference @xmath42 .",
    "the rg - transformation drives the theory away from ultraviolet fixed point @xmath33 .",
    "the rg - evolution of the entanglement entropy for the ising model is known precisely @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the entanglement entropy in the ising spin chain ( [ 6 ] ) at a fixed @xmath30 as a function of magnetic field strength @xmath32 is shown on fig .",
    "this behaviour is in accord with a general property : in unitary theories the entanglement entropy should not increase along the rg flow because rg transformations eliminate contribution of the high energy modes .    the fact that the entropy is not increasing does not imply the same property for the induced coupling @xmath254 defined by ( [ in-5 ] ) .",
    "the coupling behaves as the density of the entropy , @xmath255 , where @xmath15 is the number of space - time dimensions and @xmath256 is a function which has the same rg - evolution as the entropy . in three - dimensional model discussed in section ii.d",
    "the induced gravitational coupling defined by ( [ in-5 ] ) increases under rg - evolution . on the other hand , in four - dimensional model the gravitational coupling decreases which means that gravitational interactions get weaker in the infrared region .",
    "the scaling hypothesis in classical critical phenomena asserts that the physics is determined by large scale fluctuations which do not depend on the underlying microscopical details .",
    "for instance , in a magnetic at temperature @xmath54 in an external field @xmath257 which undergoes a second order phase transition the physical properties are determined by the large domains of aligned spins .",
    "the microscopic atomic scale does not enter thermodynamical relations near the critical point @xmath258 .",
    "non - analytic dependence of the physical quantities on @xmath259 is entirely determined by a `` singular part '' of free energy density @xmath260 .",
    "this part has a universal scaling @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the correlation length and @xmath263 is the scaling dimension of @xmath257 .",
    "functions @xmath264 are universal in a sense they coincide for different systems from the same class .",
    "let us denote by @xmath265 the surface density of the `` renormalized '' part of the entanglement entropy in the ground state , see section ii.e .",
    "this is the part of the entropy which remains finite in the limit @xmath182 . in general",
    ", @xmath265 is a function of external fields @xmath257 , and other parameters , @xmath266 , driving the phase transition of the system at @xmath267 . by using analogy with the classical scaling",
    "one can conjecture that near a critical point @xmath265 has the following scaling ) holds only for the ground state entanglement entropy . ]",
    "@xmath268 where @xmath269 is the correlation length , @xmath263 is the scaling dimension , and @xmath270 are universal functions .",
    "it can be also suggested that the divergent part of the entropy is analytic in @xmath266 .",
    "one can check the validity of these statements in scalar field models discussed in section ii.d . in the limit when the edge size @xmath117 of the cube is large one finds from ( [ s3 ] ) , ( [ s4 ] ) that @xmath271 in @xmath272 and @xmath273 in @xmath145 .    in analogue models of gravity",
    "the universality conjecture ( [ scale ] ) means that the part of the induced newton coupling ( [ in-5 ] ) which does not depend on the cutoff is a universal function .",
    "this part of the coupling can be determined entirely in terms of an effective low - energy qft and it does not depend on the details of the underlying microscopic theory .      studying entanglement in gravity analogs might be helpful for understanding the microscopical origin of the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath22 of black holes . as was discussed in section",
    "i.b , if the gravity is entirely induced by some underlying degrees of freedom the entropy of a black hole can be related to the entanglement between observable states and states hidden inside the horizon . understanding the relation between the two entropies in the framework of a local relativistic quantum field theory",
    "is plagued by the problem of the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the definition of the induced newton coupling either requires introduction of the ultraviolet cutoff or working with a special class of ultraviolet finite theories with non - minimal couplings @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the presence of non - minimal couplings makes statistical interpretation of @xmath22 a difficult task .",
    "the equality of @xmath22 to the fundamental entanglement entropy @xmath17 is implied in suggestion ( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "one of the arguments why it should be true is that both in classical and in quantum theory the bekenstein - hawking entropy can be derived by the conical singularity method from the gravitational action ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , in the same way which we employed for calculation of @xmath17 .",
    "if equality ( [ i3 ] ) holds one has a tool to learn more about the degrees of freedom responsible for the origin of @xmath22 by using gravity analogs .",
    "there are different questions which can be addressed in different models .",
    "for instance , can one relate these degrees of freedom in the 3d ising model with non - critical stings , do the near - horizon symmetries play any role in the entropy counting as was suggested in @xcite , and other questions .",
    "this paper has two purposes .",
    "first , we wanted to show how the effective action approach and the methods of spectral geometry can be applied for derivation of the entanglement entropy in condensed matter systems in the regimes when these systems can be described by relativistic qft s . in particular ,",
    "such regimes appear in the vicinity of the second order phase transitions . by using the effective action approach we established the form of the entanglement entropy in the presence of boundaries at zero and high temperatures .",
    "our new result is establishing the geometrical structure of the subleading terms in the entropy , eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "second , we showed that in the effective action approach the black hole entropy and the entanglement entropy have the same geometrical origin , the conical singularities of a background manifold . on this base",
    "we conjectured ( and this is the main result of the paper ) that the surface density of the fundamental entanglement entropy in the genuine quantum gravity theory and the low - energy gravitational coupling @xmath1 are related by ( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we suggested to use this relation to study the properties of @xmath1 in analogue gravity models and pointed several topics where this kind of research could be interesting .",
