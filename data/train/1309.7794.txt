    "weil rigidity ( @xcite ) states that @xmath10 is discrete if and only if @xmath1 is not locally isomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "an example of the failure of rigidity is when @xmath12 , @xmath3 is the fundamental group of a riemann surface of genus @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the poincar disk . then @xmath15 is the teichmller space , which has dimension @xmath16 .",
    "the study of deformations of discontinuous groups for non - riemannian homogeneous spaces and the failure of rigidity was initiated by kobayashi @xcite ; kobayashi @xcite treats the case when @xmath1 is semi - simple .",
    "a complete description of the parameter and deformation spaces was first given for @xmath17 acting on @xmath18 via some nilpotent group of transformations @xmath1 in @xcite and these results were extended to the case where @xmath1 is the heisenberg group , @xmath19 is any connected lie subgroup and @xmath3 is a subgroup acting properly discontinuously and freely on @xmath20 , in @xcite .    in this paper , we give a concrete description of the space @xmath21 , where @xmath1 is the heisenberg group , @xmath22 is the discrete heisenberg group and the direct product group @xmath23 acts on the group manifold @xmath1 from the left and right .",

    "similarly @xmath3 always acts properly discontinuously from the right with compact quotient @xmath30 .    to let @xmath3 act both from the left and from the right , we rewrite @xmath1 as the homogeneous space @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the diagonal embedding .",

    "to check for proper discontinuity of the action of @xmath44 , we will use a criterion by nasrin @xcite for 2-step nilpotent groups , which relates properness to the _ property _ ( ci ) .",
