    "magnetotransport provides important information on fermi surface characteristics , disorder and localization mechanisms in low - dimensional electron systems .",
    "a comprehensive review of the electronic properties and electronic transport in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems was presented by ando , fowler and stern  @xcite in early eighties .",
    "the discovery of quantum hall effects around the same time led to the realization that , in strong magnetic field , quantization effects lead to novel transport features  @xcite . in the late eighties , it was found that in moderately strong magnetic fields ; when quantization effects are absent but cyclotron dynamics is present ; interesting set of phenomena occur . in this regard ,",
    "it was observed that commensurability oscillations in the magnetoresistance occur in periodically modulated 2deg systems  @xcite . in particular , periodic oscillations in 1/b",
    "( b is the applied magnetic field ) is observed in the magnetoresistance of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) subjected to weak  @xcite and strong  @xcite periodic potential . in addition to magnetoresistance ,",
    "magnetoplamons in these systems have also been investigated ,  @xcite and references therein . in a series of experiments carried out in 2001 - 2003 , it was found that a 2deg subjected to microwave radiation in an applied magnetic field yields even richer physics . when a high mobility 2deg is irradiated by microwave radiation in a weak magnetic field , the longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibits giant oscillations .",
    "this was the discovery of microwave induced resistance oscillations ( miro )  @xcite .",
    "a significant feature of these studies has been the observation of zero - resistance states ( zrs ) in these systems ; the lower order minima in miro go all the way to zero  @xcite .",
    "observation of zrs was quite a surprise ; eventhough longitudinal resistance exhibits zrs in integer quantum hall systems but the magnetic field required here is smaller by a factor of 50 . unlike quantum hall phenomena ,",
    "the vanishing of longitudinal magnetoresistance does not lead to quantization of hall resistance .",
    "this led to the understanding that weak landau quantization and weak microwave radiation can significantly alter the transport properties of a 2deg .",
    "this discovery opened the field of nonequilibrium transport in high landau levels  @xcite .",
    "several explanations have been put forward  @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical work relies on the combined effect of landau quantization and applied fields on momentum relaxation due to impurity scattering with in a landau band ; alternatively experimental results are explained on the basis of redistribution of electrons in a disorder broadened landau band due to interaction with microwaves .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the appearance of zrs in a 2deg in the presence of both mw radiation and an external magnetic field is still far from settled . in this work",
    ", we will investigate whether it is possible to find an explanation of this phenomenon with in a single particle semiclassical picture . in this regard",
    ", we will focus on the effect of plane polarized electromagnetic radiation on the cyclotron motion of electrons in a 2deg system .",
    "cyclotron motion of electrons in a 2deg has been extensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "we base our study on  [ ] and extend it to include the effects of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "in particular , we find that cyclotron trajectories are significantly modified under the influence of radiation .",
    "further , commensurability oscillations in the magnetoresistivity of 2deg are induced by radiation .",
    "interestingly , we find a sequence of zero - resistance states ( zrs ) inherited from the suppression of shubnikov - de haas oscillations ( sdho ) by high - frequency and large amplitude microwave radiation .",
    "the zrs are well pronounced and persist up to broad intervals of magnetic field as observed in many experiments on microwave illuminated 2deg  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the formation of zrs strongly depends on the frequency of mw radiation and disappear at low frequencies . this fact is further confirmed by investigating a range of mw frequency where the system is completely driven to zrs.the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "the analytic expressions for the electron dynamics in external magnetic field and mw radiation can be obtained in the semiclassical regime specified by the criterion , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the fermi wave vector given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the electron density .",
