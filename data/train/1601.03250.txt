    "quantum entanglement , which is recognized as an essential ingredient for testing local hidden variable theories against quantum mechanics , has extensive application in quantum computing and quantum information processing .",
    "it is well known that multipartite entangled states have many properties more peculiar than the bipartite ones because they exhibit the contradiction between local hidden variable theories and quantum mechanics even for nonstatistical predictions , as opposed to the statistical ones for the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) states  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that genuine three - qubit entanglement comes in two different inconvertible types represented by the ghz state and the w state  @xcite .",
    "the ghz state is inequivalent to the w state in the sense that they can not be converted into each other even under any stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) .",
    "these two kinds of entangled states represent two distinct classes of three - qubit entanglement and can perform different quantum information processing tasks , and much interest has been paid in the investigation of how to convert the two types of entanglement into each other . based on positive operator valued measures ( povms ) , walther _",
    "proposed a method to convert a ghz state to an arbitrarily good approximation to a w state and experimentally realized this scheme in the three - photon case  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors experimentally demonstrated a transformation of two einstein - podolsky - rosen photon pairs distributed among three parties into a three - photon w state using local operations and classical communication .",
    "we also proposed a linear optical method to convert @xmath0 @xmath1 entangled two - photon pairs distributed among @xmath2 parties into a @xmath2-photon w state  @xcite . through a dissipative dynamics process in an open quantum system , song _ et al . _ showed that a four - atom w state can be converted into a ghz state with deterministic probability  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we proposed a linear - optics - based scheme for local conversion of four einstein - podolsky - rosen photon pairs distributed among five parties into four - photon polarization - entangled decoherence - free states using slocc and non - photon - number - resolving detectors  @xcite .",
    "these works make it possible to convert different kinds of quantum states into each other .",
    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) system is a promising candidate for quantum information processing because atoms are suitable for storing information in stationary nodes and photons suitable for transporting information . in practice , however , the distribution of entanglement for atoms over long distance is difficult because of unavoidable transmission losses and decoherence in the quantum channel . in recent years , several schemes",
    "have been proposed to realize quantum computation and engineer entanglement between atoms trapped in distant optical cavities , either through detection of leaking photons  @xcite , or through direct connection of the cavities by optical fiber  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for converting a three - atom w state to a ghz state with the certain success probability . in the scheme each @xmath3-type atom is individually trapped in an optical cavity and by the interference and detections of the polarized photons leaking out of the separate optical cavities , the conversion from a three - atom w state to a ghz state is achieved .",
    "the scheme does not require the simultaneous click of the detectors and it is robust against the asynchronous emission of the polarized photons and the detection inefficiency .",
