    "cosmic rays ( crs ) are widely accepted to be produced in snrs by the diffusive shock acceleration process at the outer blast wave ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews ) . kinetic nonlinear theory of diffusive cr acceleration in snrs",
    "@xcite couples the gas dynamics of the explosion with the particle acceleration .",
    "therefore in a spherically symmetric approach it is able to predict the evolution of gas density , pressure , mass velocity , as well as the positions of the forward shock and the contact discontinuity , together with the energy spectrum and the spatial distribution of cr nuclei and electrons at any given evolutionary epoch @xmath6 , including the properties of the nonthermal radiation .",
    "the application of this theory to individual snrs @xcite has demonstrated its power in explaining the observed snr properties and in predicting new effects like the extent of magnetic field amplification , leading to the concentration of the highest - energy electrons in a very thin shell just behind the shock .",
    "recent observations with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray telescopes in space have confirmed earlier detections of nonthermal continuum emission in hard x - rays from young shell - type snrs . with _",
    "it became even possible to resolve spatial scales down to the arcsec extension of individual dynamical structures like shocks @xcite .",
    "the filamentary hard x - ray structures are the result of strong synchrotron losses of the emitting multi - tev electrons in amplified magnetic fields downstream of the outer accelerating snr shock @xcite .",
    "such observational results gain their qualitative significance through the fact that these effective magnetic fields and morphologies turned out to be exactly the same as predicted theoretically from acceleration theory .",
    "this theory has been applied in detail to tycho s snr , in order to compare results with the existing data @xcite .",
    "we have used a stellar ejecta mass @xmath7 , distance @xmath8  kpc , and interstellar medium ( ism ) number density @xmath9   h - atoms @xmath10 . for these parameters",
    "a total hydrodynamic explosion energy @xmath11  erg was derived to fit the observed size @xmath12 and expansion speed @xmath13 . a rather high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath14  @xmath15 g and a proton injection rate @xmath16 are needed to reproduce the observed steep and concave radio spectrum and to ensure a smooth cutoff of the synchrotron emission in the x - ray region .",
    "we believe that the required strength of the magnetic field , that is significantly higher than the mhd compression of a @xmath17 g ism field , has to be attributed to nonlinear field amplification at the sn shock by cr acceleration itself . according to plasma physical considerations @xcite , the existing ism magnetic field",
    "can indeed be significantly amplified at a strong shock by cr streaming instabilities .",
    "after adjustment of the predictions of the nonlinear spherically - symmetric model by a physically necessary renormalization of the number of accelerated cr nuclei to take account of the quasi - perpendicular shock directions in a snr , very good consistency with the existing observational data was achieved .",
    "using _ chandra _ x - ray observations @xcite have recently estimated the ratio between the radius @xmath18 of the contact discontinuity ( cd ) , separating the swept - up ism and the ejecta material , and the radius @xmath19 of the forward shock .",
    "the large mean value @xmath20 of this ratio was interpreted as evidence for efficient cr acceleration , which makes the medium between those two discontinuities more compressible .    here",
    "we present the calculations of the mean ratio @xmath21 , which are the unchanged part of our earlier considerations @xcite , and demonstrate that these results , which are in fact predictions , fit the above measurements very well . since our calculations have been made in spherical symmetry they concern a priori an azimuthally averaged ratio @xmath21 .",
    "we shall extend them by taking the effects of the rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instability of the cd into account .",
    "we shall in addition discuss a physical mechanism that leads to the observed _ azimuthal _ variations of @xmath21 .",
    "finally we shall take the recent determination of the mechanical energy output @xmath22 @xcite which results from the theory of delayed detonations in the physics of type ia sn explosions @xcite , in order to predict a range for the @xmath1-ray spectrum that is consistent with the existing upper limits of high energy @xmath1-ray fluxes from tycho s snr .",
    "fig.1 and partly fig.2 show the calculations of shock and cd related quantities which were part of our earlier considerations @xcite . the calculated shock as well as cd radii and speeds",
    "are shown as a function of time for the two different cases of interior magnetic field strengths @xmath23  @xmath15 g and @xmath24  @xmath15 g considered , together with the azimuthally averaged experimental data available at the time .",
    ", contact discontinuity radius @xmath18 , shock speed @xmath25 , and contact discontinuity speed @xmath26 , for tychos snr as functions of time , including particle acceleration ; ( b ) total shock ( @xmath27 ) and subshock ( @xmath28 ) compression ratios .",
    "the _ dotted vertical line _ marks the current epoch .",
    "the _ solid and dashed lines _ correspond to the internal magnetic field strength @xmath23  @xmath15 g and ( @xmath24  @xmath15 g ) , respectively .",
    "the observed mean size and speed of the shock , as determined by radio measurements @xcite , are shown as well.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    according to fig.1a tycho is nearing the adiabatic phase . to fit the spectral shape of the observed radio emission we assumed a proton injection rate @xmath16 .",
    "this leads to a significant nonlinear modification of the shock at the current age of @xmath29  yrs .",
    "a larger magnetic field lowers the alfvnic mach number and therefore leads to a decrease of the shock compression ratio , as seen in fig.1b .",
    "the result is a total compression ratio @xmath30 and a subshock compression ratio @xmath31 for @xmath23  @xmath15 g . in turn",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 , for @xmath24  @xmath15 g .    therefore ,",
    "as can be seen from fig.2 , including cr acceleration at the outer blast wave , the calculated value of the ratio @xmath21 for @xmath24  @xmath15 g is slightly lower than for @xmath23  @xmath15 g . at the current epoch",
    "we have @xmath34 which is lower than the value @xmath20 inferred from the observations .",
    "qualitatively our result goes in the same direction as calculations by @xcite which modeled snrs with a uniform specific heat ratio @xmath35 , for the circumstellar medium and the ejecta material alike .    projecting a highly structured shell onto the plane of",
    "the sky tends to favor protruding parts of the shell .",
    "therefore the average radius measured in projection is an overestimate of the true average radius . analysing the amount of bias from the projection for the shock and cd radii @xcite found a corrected `` true '' value @xmath20 which is lower than their measured `` projected average '' value @xmath36 , as a result of the above geometrical effect .    in turn , starting from a spherically symmetric calculation of the cd radius , as we do , one has to take into account that the actual cd is subject to the r - t instability . in the nonlinear regime",
    "it leads to effective mixing of the ejecta and swept - up ism material with `` fingers '' of the ejecta on top of this mixing region , which extend farther into the shocked gas than the radius @xmath18 predicted when assuming spherical symmetry e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore our ratio @xmath37 , calculated within the spherically symmetric approach , has to be corrected for this effect in order to compare it with the measured value @xmath20 . in the case",
    "when all the fingers have length @xmath38 and occupy half of the cd surface , one would have a mean cd size @xmath39 which has to be compared with @xmath40 . according to the numerical modelling of @xcite , albeit without particle acceleration ,",
    "the r - t instability allows fingers of ejecta to protrude beyond the spherically symmetric cd radius by 10% .",
    "the longest fingers of size @xmath41 occupy less than 50% of the cd surface .",
    "however , in projection they stick out of the mixing region , whose thickness is roughly @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to a rough estimate of the corrected cd radius @xmath43 which has to be compared with the experimentally estimated value .",
    "the comparison of the corrected values @xmath44 , according to our earlier calculations as well as for different assumptions ( see below ) about the explosion energy and source distance , with this experimentally estimated value @xmath20 ( in fig.2 we present that value with 2% uncertainties , according to @xcite ) shows quite good agreement ( see figs.2 and 3 ) even if one takes into account some uncertainty in the quantitative determination of our correction factor @xmath45 , which in our view lies in the range 1.03 - 1.07 .     of the radii of the contact discontinuity and the forward shock as a function of time .",
    "_ solid and dashed _ lines correspond to the same two cases as in fig.1 .",
    "the lines of all other styles correspond to the sn explosion energy @xmath0  erg and four different distances ( see the caption of fig.3 ) _ thin _ lines represent the values calculated in the spherically symmetric model , whereas the _ thick _ lines show the values @xmath44 which contain the correction for the effect produced by the r - t instability .",
    "the experimental point is taken from @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     and _ bottom panel _ : the ratio @xmath21 of the radii of the contact discontinuity and the forward shock as a function of azimutal angle @xcite .",
    "the regions where @xmath46 are shadowed .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another interesting peculiarity of tycho s shock structure , which we would like to discuss here , is the quite irregular behaviour of the radius of the forward shock around the edge of the visible snr disk , that is clearly seen in fig.[w ] .",
    "large shock distortions of this kind are not expected to result from the r - t instability . at first sight",
    "such a variation of the values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 can be easily attributed to fluctuations of the ambient ism density and/or to an inhomogeneously distributed density and velocity field of the ejected matter .",
    "the local shock part , which encounters a lower ism density or has a faster ejecta portion behind , propagates faster compared with the neighbouring shock pieces .",
    "this will lead to the formation of local forward displacements of the cd and the forward shock whose number and relative sizes are determined by the specific structure of the ism and/or ejecta . since a larger shock compression ratio is expected for higher shock speed ( see fig.1b ) , one should also expect a smaller difference between @xmath19 and @xmath18 on the top region of each such displacement .",
    "this is exactly what is observed",
    ".    such arguments would give a good explanation for the observed picture only if cr injection / acceleration took place uniformly across the entire shock surface .",
    "however , in our view the actual situation is expected to be more complicated  and physically more interesting .",
    "efficient injection of suprathermal nuclear particles into the acceleration process takes place in those local shock regions , where the forward shock is quasi - parallel , and these regions are distributed over the shock surface according to the ambient ism magnetic field structure and occupy in total about 20% of the shock @xcite . as a result",
    "one would expect that only about 20% of the local forward shock displacements efficiently accelerate nuclear crs , and therefore display the extraordinary high ratio @xmath21 . in reality",
    "the most extreme values @xmath47 are observed on randomly distributed local shock regions , and the positions of these regions roughly coincide with the positions of extended shock displacements .",
    "to explain such a correlation a strong physical connection between the shock speed and the efficiency of cr injection / acceleration should exist : the local parts of the shock with large speed effectively produce crs and vice versa .",
    "there are at least two physical processes which can resolve the above problem .",
    "the first one gives high injection on the leading part of the displacements , if they are formed due to ism and/or ejecta inhomogeneities and initially the injection was suppressed here as a result of a highly oblique magnetic field . since after its formation",
    "the leading part of the displacement develops a large curvature , it will have a significant portion which becomes quasi - parallel , and therefore efficient cr injection / acceleration is expected over the whole leading part of such a displacement .",
    "the second factor can presumably itself lead to the formation of displacements , even in the case of a uniform ism and a spherically symmetric ejecta distribution .",
    "a significant fraction of the internal energy behind a quasi - parallel part of the shock front is contained in crs .",
    "since the shock is expected to be modified , the cr spectrum is very hard and therefore the pressure is mainly carried by the crs with the highest energies . with their high mobility",
    "these crs can diffuse laterally into neighbouring downstream volumes , which are located behind shock surfaces not producing crs .",
    "this diffusive loss leads to a decrease of the internal pressure behind the quasi - parallel parts of the shock .",
    "therefore the corresponding downstream ejecta undergo less deceleration . as a result",
    "these ejecta accelerate relative to their surroundings .",
    "this leads to the formation of a local displacement .",
    "one can expect that this also distorts the initially spherically symmetric shock .",
    "we therefore conclude that the effectively accelerating parts of the forward shock are among those regions , where the displacements occur , and they may actually delineate them .",
    "predominantly fingers are situated on the effectively accelerating parts of the shock surface .",
    "if this is correct it gives a unique experimental identification of the areas at the outer snr shock which efficiently produce nuclear crs .",
    "since the most outwardly displaced parts of the cd and the shock with a high ratio @xmath21 have to be interpreted as the regions with efficient cr injection / acceleration , this opens the possibility to experimentally distinguish the shock areas with efficient cr production from those where crs are not produced .",
    "a rough estimate shows that in tycho s snr the regions with extremely high ratios @xmath48 and the displacements occupy about 20% of the shock surface see fig.4 of @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the theoretical expectation .",
    "our last point regards constraints which the recent re - evaluation of the mechanical output @xmath49  erg together with the _ hegra _ upper limit for the tev @xmath1-ray flux @xcite approximately impose on the distance and ambient density for tycho s snr . with this new @xmath50-value",
    "we find a consistent fit for all existing data  the snr size , its expansion rate , overall synchrotron spectrum and the filament structure of the x - ray emission  like it was done for the previously defined explosion energy @xmath51  erg ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in particular , the fit of @xmath19 and @xmath25 , which is of the same quality as in fig.1 for @xmath51  erg , gives for each assumed distance @xmath4 a rather definite value of the ism number density @xmath52 .",
    "a rough explanation of this numerical result is the following : since for a given experimentally measured angular snr size and its expansion rate the linear size @xmath19 and the speed @xmath25 scale proportionally to distance @xmath4 , and since in the nearby ( in time ) sedov phase @xmath53 , the density @xmath54 decreases with increasing distance @xmath4 .",
    "the hadronic @xmath1-ray flux @xmath55 is then expected to scale as @xmath56 .",
    "the ejected mass is still assumed to be @xmath57 .",
    "we also find the same nuclear injection rate @xmath16 for all cases , and downstream magnetic field values @xmath58",
    "@xmath15 g .",
    "at the same time , the linear size @xmath59 of an x - ray filament increases proportional to @xmath4",
    ". therefore the magnetic field strength @xmath60 @xcite , determined from the filament sizes ( see introduction ) , decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "-ray emission from tycho s snr , as a function of @xmath1-ray energy @xmath61 , for a mechanical sn explosion energy of @xmath62  erg and four different distances @xmath4 and corresponding values of the ism number densities @xmath63 .",
    "all cases have a dominant hadronic compared to inverse compton @xmath1-ray flux .",
    "experimental data are the upper limits of the _ hegra _ ( h - ct ; @xcite ) and _ whipple _ ( w ; @xcite ) cherenkov telescopes and the 95% confidence _",
    "hegra airobicc _",
    "( ha ; @xcite ) upper limit.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to find the constraint on the distance @xmath4 and the ism density @xmath63 , we then compare in fig.3 the resulting @xmath1-ray spectral energy distribution with the _ hegra _ and whipple upper limits at tev energies .",
    "it is seen that all distances @xmath64  kpc are inconsistent with the _ hegra _ data .",
    "distances of @xmath65  kpc are still consistent with the @xmath1-ray data , although there is a growing discrepancy between @xmath66 and @xmath67 : at @xmath68  kpc @xmath69  @xmath15 g which is already considerably smaller than @xmath58  @xmath15 g .",
    "therefore we believe that we can constrain the source distance also from above , @xmath70  kpc . in fig.2",
    "we also show the values for @xmath21 and @xmath44 for the case @xmath71  erg and these increased distances . within our approximate determination of @xmath72 from @xmath18",
    "they still agree with the _ chandra _ data , in particular because the cr production rates are comparable . our calculations of the @xmath1-ray emission lead us to predict that the new northern hemisphere tev detectors should detect this source at tev - energies in , predominantly , hadronic @xmath1-rays :",
    "the expected @xmath73-decay @xmath1-ray energy flux @xmath2  erg/(@xmath3s ) extends up to almost 100  tev if the distance is indeed within the range 3.3 - 4 kpc . as a corollary",
    "the detection of a tev signal is not only important by itself , but it is also crucial for the correct determination of all other key supernova parameters .",
