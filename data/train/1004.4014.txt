    "we consider the classical lagrange function interpolation problem in the following `` discrete '' setting .",
    "let @xmath0 be a given set of mutually distinct interpolation nodes , and let @xmath1 be a given set of `` basis '' functions .",
    "for any given function @xmath2 we seek a linear combination of the basis functions that interpolates @xmath2 at all interpolation nodes , @xmath3 the coefficients @xmath4 can be computed by solving the linear system @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the so - called _ collocation matrix _ containing the values of the basis functions at the interpolation nodes @xmath7 if the basis functions are linearly independent on @xmath8 , the matrix @xmath6 is nonsingular , and the interpolation problem has a unique solution for all functions @xmath2 .",
    "the sensitivity of the solution is then determined by the condition number @xmath9 of the collocation matrix @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the standard operator @xmath12-norm , with @xmath13 .",
    "the polynomial b - splines of a fixed degree @xmath14 are frequently used as the basis functions in practice . such a basis is uniquely determined by a given multiset of knots that defines the local smoothness of the basis functions .",
    "the corresponding collocation matrix is always totally nonnegative ( see  @xcite ) , regardless of the choice of the interpolation nodes .",
    "a particular choice of nodes is of special interest , both in theory and in practice , for shape preserving approximation .",
    "when the nodes are located at the so - called greville sites , i.e. , at the _ knot averages _ , the interpolant has the variation diminishning property . moreover , for low order b - spline interpolation , it can be shown that @xmath15 is bounded _ independently _ of the knot sequence  @xcite .    on these grounds , in 1975 , carl de boor  @xcite conjectured that the interpolation by b - splines of degree @xmath14 at knot averages is bounded by a function that depends only on @xmath14 , regardless of the knots themselves . in our terms , the conjecture says that @xmath15 or , equivalently , @xmath16 is bounded by a function of @xmath14 only .",
    "the conjecture was disproved by rong ",
    "qing jia  @xcite in 1988 .",
    "he proved that , for geometric meshes , the condition number @xmath15 is not bounded independently of the knot sequence , for degrees @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , it is a natural question whether exists any class of meshes for which de boor s conjecture is valid . since geometric meshes are highly nonuniform , the most likely candidates for the validity are uniform meshes .    here",
    "we discuss the problem of interpolation at knot averages by b - splines with _ equidistant simple _ knots .",
    "the corresponding b - splines are symmetric on the support , and have the highest possible smoothness .",
    "it is easy to see that the condition of this interpolation does not depend on the knot spacing @xmath18 , and we can take @xmath19 .",
    "so , just for simplicity , we shall consider only the cardinal b - splines , i.e. , b - splines with simple knots placed at successive integers .",
    "it should be stressed that the only free parameters in this problem are the _ degree _ @xmath14 of the b - splines and the _ size _",
    "@xmath20 of the interpolation problem .",
    "our aim is to prove that the condition of @xmath6 can be bounded independently of its order .",
    "the corresponding collocation matrices @xmath6 are symmetric , positive definite , and most importantly , tplitz .",
    "but , it is not easy to compute the elements of @xmath21 , or even reasonably sharp estimates of their magnitudes .",
    "so , the natural choice of norm in ( [ 1.1 ] ) is the spectral norm @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denote the largest and the smallest singular value of @xmath6 , respectively .    for low spline degrees @xmath25 ,",
    "the collocation matrices are also strictly diagonally dominant , and it is easy to bound @xmath26 by a constant .",
    "consequently , de boor s conjecture is valid for @xmath25 .    for higher degrees ,",
    "the condition number can be estimated by embedding the tplitz matrix @xmath6 into circulant matrices of higher orders .",
    "the main advantage of this technique , developed by davis  @xcite and arbenz  @xcite , lies in the fact that the eigenvalues of a circulant matrix are easily computable .",
    "the final bounds for @xmath26 are obtained by using the cauchy interlace theorem for singular values ( see  @xcite for details ) , to bound both singular values in ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review some basic properties of cardinal b - splines .",
    "the proof of de boor s conjecture for low degree ( @xmath25 ) cardinal b - splines is given in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we describe the embedding technique and derive the estimates for @xmath26 .    despite all efforts , we are unable to prove de boor s conjecture in this , quite probably , the easiest case .",
    "the final section contains the results of numerical testing that strongly support the validity of the conjecture , as well as some additional conjectures based on these test results .",
    "let @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , be a sequence of simple uniformly spaced knots .",
    "this sequence determines a unique sequence of normalized b - splines @xmath29 of degree @xmath14 , such that the spline @xmath30 is non - trivial only on the interval @xmath31 .",
    "each of these b - splines can obtained , by translation and scaling , from the basic b - spline @xmath32 with knots @xmath33 , @xmath34 here , @xmath35 denotes the truncated powers @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , while @xmath38 the normalized version of the basic spline is defined as @xmath39 from ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) , we obtain the _ normalized _ b - spline basis @xmath40 : @xmath41    if the interpolation nodes @xmath42 are located at the knot averages , i.e. , @xmath43 then @xmath44 and the schnberg  whitney theorem  @xcite guarantees that the collocation matrix is nonsingular",
    ". moreover , this matrix is totally nonnegative  @xcite , i.e. , all of its minors are nonnegative . due to symmetry of b - splines on uniform meshes ,",
    "the collocation matrices are also symmetric and tplitz .",
    "so , we can conclude that cardinal b - spline collocation matrix is tplitz , symmetric and positive definite .",
    "it is easy to show that the elements of the collocation matrix do not depend on the step - size @xmath18 of the uniform mesh , so we take the simplest one with @xmath19 and @xmath45 .",
    "such b - splines are called cardinal . the interpolation nodes ( [ 2.3 ] )",
    "are integers for odd degrees , while for even degrees , the interpolation nodes are in the middle of the two neighbouring knots of the cardinal b - spline .     of degree @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "cox recurrence formula ( [ 2.4 ] ) involves only basic arithmetic operations on rational coefficients .",
    "these elements are therefore exactly computable in ( arbitrary precise ) rational arithmetic .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the values of cardinal b - splines at knot averages ( see ( [ 2.3 ] ) ) .",
    "then , the cardinal b - spline collocation matrix @xmath6 with interpolation nodes @xmath52 is a banded tplitz matrix of order @xmath53 , to be denoted by @xmath54 the matrix @xmath55 is represented by its first row , usually called the symbol , @xmath56    it is useful to note that each b - spline of degree @xmath37 is a unimodal function , i.e. , it has only one local maximum on the support . in the case of cardinal b - splines , we have already concluded that the splines are symmetric , and therefore the maximum values of @xmath48 is attained at the middle of the support , for @xmath57 .",
    "the maximum value is @xmath58 furthermore , unimodality implies that the values of the spline @xmath48 are decreasing in the interval @xmath59 $ ] , so @xmath60    to esitmate the condition number of a cardinal b - spline we need to bound both the minimal and the maximal singular value of @xmath55 . for a symmetric and positive definite matrix ,",
    "the singular values are eigenvalues .",
