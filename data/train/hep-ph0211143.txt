    "cp violation in @xmath0 system has been established by measurements of belle experiment at kek@xcite and babar experiment at slac@xcite . in the standard model(sm ) , the phenomenon of cp violation originates from kobayashi - maskawa mechanism@xcite and the experimental results are consistent with the predictions of the sm . in near future",
    ", it is expected that measurements of cp violation and rare decay processes will be improved at the asymmetric @xmath0 factories and that the magnitude of @xmath7@xmath8 mixing will be determined at the fermilab tevatron experiments@xcite . within a few years , we will be able to know whether or not significant effects of new physics reside in the @xmath0 systems .",
    "supersymmetry(susy ) is one of the most attractive candidates of physics beyond the sm .",
    "susy gives a justification to the electroweak scale , which is much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "in susy models , there exist some features : ( i ) the gauge coupling constants can be unified , ( ii ) the existence of light higgs boson is predicted , ( iii ) there are superpartners of the sm particles , and so on .",
    "mass matrices of superpartners of quarks and leptons are new sources of flavor mixing and cp violation . these mass matrices are determined from susy breaking terms in the lagrangian , and these terms reflect the susy breaking mechanism and interactions that present between the scale of the susy breaking and the electroweak scale . for general soft susy breaking , if the squark and slepton masses are below a few tev , the experimental data of @xmath3 which is related to the cp violation in @xmath9 mixing and @xmath10 require strong degeneracy between the first- and second - family squarks and sleptons . in order to realize this degeneracy , many flavor models are considered and these models predict different flavor structures . therefore if susy particles are discovered at lhc and/or a linear collider experiment , @xmath0 physics",
    "is expected to play an important role in studying the flavor structure of susy models .",
    "now we address the following question : can we distinguish susy models by measurements at @xmath0 factories ? in order to answer this question , we investigate susy effects on @xmath0 physics in three different susy models , namely ( i ) the minimal supergravity(msugra ) model , ( ii ) the su(5 ) susy grand unified theory ( gut ) with right - handed neutrinos@xcite , and ( iii ) a supersymmetric model with u(2 ) flavor symmetry@xcite . in our recent paper@xcite ,",
    "we focus on the new physics search through the consistency check of the unitarity triangle and we evaluate susy effects on cp asymmetries in @xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath12 . in this talk , besides these observables , we also evaluate both direct and mixing cp asymmetries in @xmath13 .",
    "here , we give a brief description of models . a detailed discussion of these models can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the msugra",
    ", susy is spontaneously broken in the hidden sector and the hidden sector of the theory communicates with our mssm sector only through the gravitational interaction .",
    "the soft breaking terms are induced through the gravitational interaction and the structure of soft breaking terms have no new flavor mixing at the scale where the soft breaking terms are induced . in this model ,",
    "the source of flavor mixing is only ckm mixing matrix .",
    "the universality of the squark sector is lost due to radiative corrections induced by the ckm mixing .",
    "we use renormalization group(rg ) equations in order to trace these radiative corrections and determine the soft breaking terms at the electroweak scale .",
    "the measurements of three gauge coupling constants support the idea of the supersymmetric grand unification .",
    "furthermore , recent results of neutrino oscillation experiments suggest the existence of finite mass of neutrinos . in order to explain these points , the su(5 )",
    "susy gut with right - handed neutrinos is considered@xcite .    in this model ,",
    "the soft breaking terms are the same as in the msugra model at the scale where the soft breaking terms are induced . unlike the msugra model , the su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos have two sources of flavor mixing .",
    "one is ckm matrix as in the case of the msugra .",
    "another is maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix@xcite , which is the mixing matrix of the lepton sector .",
    "a large flavor mixing in the neutrino sector can affect the squark mixing in the right - handed down type sector through gut interactions .      instead of assuming the universality of sfermion mass matrices , it is possible to solve the flavor problem of susy by introducing some flavor symmetry .",
    "u(2 ) flavor symmetry is one of such symmetries .",
    "we use the model given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this model , the quark and lepton supermultiplets in the first and the second generations",
    "transform as doublets under the u(2 ) flavor symmetry while the third generation and the higgs supermultiplets are singlet under the u(2 ) .    in order to obtain the correct structure of yukawa couplings , we assume that the breaking pattern of the u(2 ) is @xmath14 with this u(2 ) breaking , we obtain the quark yukawa couplings @xmath15 and the squark mass matrices @xmath16 : @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are parameters of the u(2 ) and u(1 ) symmetry breakings respectively , and @xmath21 s , @xmath22 s , @xmath23 s , @xmath24 s , @xmath25 s , and @xmath26 s are dimensionless constant parameters of @xmath27 .    in the mass matrices of sfermions in this model , the degeneracy between masses of the first and the second generation is naturally realized , while mass of the third generation may be separated from the others and there exist flavor mixing between the 2nd and the 3rd generation of sfermions .",

    ", we introduce new cp violating phases on the tri - linear scalar couplings(@xmath28-terms ) .",
    "first , we discuss susy contributions to @xmath4 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we vary @xmath32 and @xmath31 and impose experimental constraints such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the measured values of @xmath3 and @xmath1 , and the lower bound of @xmath2 . in fig .",

    ", it seems that there are at most 10% deviations in both the @xmath35 plane and the @xmath36 plane .    in the su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos , though we can see the deviation of order one in each observable , all the allowed points lie between the lines corresponding to the sm values with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the fact that there exist significant susy contribution only to the @xmath9 mixing , not to the @xmath39 mixing .",
    "there can be susy contribution of order one to @xmath3 , while @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath29 are not affected by susy .    in the u(2 ) model , there are susy contributions to both the @xmath9 mixing and the @xmath39 mixing .",
    "in addition to the huge susy contribution to @xmath3 , there are correction of order one to @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the @xmath4 , @xmath29 , and @xmath31 can be considerably different from the sm values .     and @xmath40 for three susy models .",
    "solid curves show the sm values with fixed @xmath37 , @xmath41 and @xmath38 . ]    here we discuss future prospects of new physics search in @xmath0 physics .",
    "it is expected that @xmath29 and @xmath4 will be precisely measured in near future at the @xmath0 factories and tevatron experiments . as an illustration , we consider two cases that @xmath4 and @xmath29 are precisely determined at future @xmath0 experiments as @xmath42 ( a ) corresponds to the case where @xmath29 , and @xmath4 are consistent with the sm .",
    "( b ) is the case where there is some inconsistency among the three observables within the sm . in fig .",

    "secondly , we evaluate the direct cp asymmetry @xmath44 in the inclusive decays @xmath13 and the mixing induced cp asymmetry @xmath45 in the exclusive decays @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes a cp eigen state which includes a strange quark such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is expected that @xmath44 would be a clean signal of new physics@xcite , because in the sm it can be calculated precisely and is found to be about 0.5%@xcite .",

    "secondly , we have investigated susy contributions to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
