    "in the universe , about 72% of the energy density is in the form of dark energy , 24% cold dark matter , and a small fraction , 4% baryon matter .",
    "since the dark energy is assumed to be spatially uniform , the dynamics of the clustering of cosmic baryon fluid should be dominated by the underlying gravitational potential of dark matter .",
    "however , it has already been recognized in the early study of cosmic structure formation that in the nonlinear regime the dynamical behavior of the cosmic baryon fluid , or of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , does nt always follow the collisionless dark matter .",
    "although the cosmic baryon fluid is passive substance in comparing with dark matter , it statistically decouples from the underlying dark matter field in the non - linear evolutionary stage . in the scale",
    "free range , the cosmic baryon fluid , as a navier - stokes fluid in the expanding universe , is similar to the fluid being moved by inertia , and should show some features as the turbulence in inertial range ( shandarin and zeldovich 1989 ) .",
    "later , it was found that the dynamical equations of the velocity fields of cosmic matter essentially are a variant of the random - force - driven burgers equation ( gurbatov et al .",
    "1989 ; berera & fang 1994 ) . for baryon fluid , it is a burgers equation driven by the random force of the gravity of dark matter ( jones 1999 ; matarrese & mohayaee 2002 ) .",
    "burgers fluid will show highly non - gaussian features due to the development of bergers turbulence when the reynolds number is large enough ( polyakov 1995 ; lssig 2000 ; bec & frisch 2000 ; davoudi et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this state ,",
    "the burgers fluid consists of shock waves in low as well as in high density regions , and therefore , non - gaussianity can be seen in low as well as in high density regions .",
    "this property has received supports from the absorption spectra of qsos , which is caused by the igm with moderate mass density .",
    "for example , the ly@xmath3 transmitted flux in the absorption spectra of qsos is found to be significantly intermittent and its probability distribution functions ( pdf ) are remarkably long tailed ( jamkhedkar et al .",
    "2000 ; pando et al .",
    "2002 ; feng et al .",
    "the and ly@xmath3 absorption lines of qso he2347 can not be explained by thermal broadening , but consistent with turbulence broadening ( zheng et al .",
    "2004 ; liu et al .",
    "moreover , samples produced by cosmological hydrodynamic simulations also reveal the statistical decoupling of baryon matter from dark matter and the non - gaussian features of bergers turbulence ( he et al . 2004 , 2005 ; kim et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one of the latest developments in this direction is that the random velocity fields of the cosmic baryon fluid are found to be extremely well described by she - leveque s ( sl ) scaling formula ( she & leveque 1994 ) in the scale range from the jeans length to larger than 10 h@xmath0 mpc ( he et al .",
    "the sl scaling formula is believed to characterize the scaling hierarchy of the non - linear evolution of navior - stokes fluid , like fully developed turbulence ( e.g. , frish 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , the dynamical features of the cosmic baryon fluid in the nonlinear regime are similar to the fully developed turbulence : it is of scaling hierarchy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sl formula has also been successfully applied to describe the mass fields of gas on interstellar scales ( boldyrev et al .",
    "2002 ; padoan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the sl formula actually is originated from a cascade of log - poisson random multiplicative process ( rmp ) , which is related to the hidden symmetry of the navier - stokes equations ( dubrulle 1994 ; she & waymire 1995 ; benzi et al .",
    "this motivate us to investigate whether the clustering behavior of the mass density field of the cosmic baryon fluid can be described by the log - poisson rmp .",
    "theoretically , this is not trivial , because the cosmic baryon fluid is compressible and dominated by the gravitational field of dark matter , while the sl scaling formula originally was proposed to describe the velocity field of incompressible fluid .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 describes the model of the log - poisson rmp for the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic baryon fluid .",
    "the predictions and its tests of the log - poisson rmp model are presented in  3 .",
    " 4 presents briefly the redshift - evolution of the coefficients of the log - poisson model . discussion and conclusion",
    "are given in  5 .",
    "the clustering and non - gaussianity of the cosmic mass density and velocity fields are usually measured by two and multiple point correlation functions . to reveal the features of the scaling hierarchy of the mass density field ,",
    "however , it is more effective to use the structure function defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the order of statistics , and the average @xmath8 is taken over the ensemble of density field . for statistically isotropic and homogenous random field @xmath9 , @xmath10 depends only on @xmath11 .",
    "the difference between the correlation function and structure function has been analyzed in detail by monin & yaglom ( 1975 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath5 is not @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the mean of density ; the variable @xmath14 can be larger than @xmath13 , but can not be less than @xmath15 , and therefore , for a nonlinear field , the distribution of @xmath16 generally is skew ; however , the distribution of @xmath17 is symmetric with respect to positive and negative @xmath17 if the field is statistically uniform .    in the scale - free range of the fluid ,",
    "the structure function as a function of @xmath11 can be expressed as a power law @xmath18 for fully developed turbulence of navier - stokes fluid , @xmath19 is a nonlinear function of @xmath7 , i.e. the mass field is intermittent , and @xmath19 is called intermittent exponent ( frisch 1995 ) . since the pioneer work of kolmogorov ( 1941 ) , it is believed that the relation of @xmath19 vs. @xmath7 is related to the scale - covariance of the dynamical equations and initial conditions . since then many hierarchy models for interpreting @xmath19 have been proposed .",
    "finally the best model is given by the sl scaling formula ( she & leveque 1994 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the sl formula is yielded from the log - poisson hierarchy process , which is related to the so - called generalized scale covariance of the navier - stokes equations ( dubrulle 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the statistical behavior of the mass field of cosmic baryon matter would also be interpreted by the log - poisson random multiplicative processes ( rmp ) .",
    "the log - poisson rmp assumes that , in the scale - free range , the variables @xmath20 on different scales @xmath11 are related from each other by a statistically hierarchy relation given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 which describes how the fluctuation @xmath23 on the larger scale @xmath24 related to fluctuations @xmath25 on the smaller scale @xmath26 . in eq.(4 ) , @xmath27 is a poisson random variable with the pdf @xmath28 to insure the normalization @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is over @xmath27 , the mean @xmath31 of the poisson distribution should be @xmath32/(1-\\beta).\\ ] ] it is enough to consider only @xmath20 , as the distribution of positive and negative @xmath17 is symmetric .",
    "the log - poisson model of equation ( 3 ) depends only on the ratio @xmath33 , thus , it is scale invariant .",
    "the model is determined by two dimensionless positive parameters : @xmath1 and @xmath2 , of which the physical meaning will be given below .",
    "equation ( 3 ) relates @xmath17 on different scales by multiplying a random factor @xmath34 , and therefore , it is a random multiplicative process ( rmp ) , which generally yields a non - gaussian field even when the field originally to be gaussian ( pando et al .",
    "1998 ) . for a gaussian field , variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 are statistically independent and it requires @xmath37 in equation ( 4 ) .      with the log - poisson model , the intermittent exponent @xmath19 is given by ( see appendix ) @xmath38.\\ ] ] for a gaussian field with scale - free power spectrum , we have @xmath39 .",
    "this indicates again that a gaussian field requires @xmath37 .",
    "considering a density field containing singular structures at positions @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 near @xmath40 with @xmath42 .",
    "the variables @xmath43 near @xmath40 should be @xmath44 , and therefore @xmath45 for higher @xmath7 , singular structures have larger contributions to @xmath10 , while for lower @xmath7 , weak - clustering structures have larger contributions to @xmath10",
    ". therefore @xmath46 measures clustering structures , which are dominant for the @xmath7-order statistics . obviously , when @xmath47 , @xmath46 should be dominated by the singular structures , i.e. , @xmath48 .    on the other hand , from equations ( 2 ) , ( 7 ) , and ( 8)",
    ", one finds @xmath49 since @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 therefore , the parameter @xmath2 of the log - poisson rmp is actually the power - law index of the mass profile of the most singular structures .",
    "it should be pointed out that the word `` singular '' is applicable only asymptotically , because we can not let @xmath52 to pick up the singular structure , as @xmath11 should be in the scale - free range .      as mentioned in last subsection , when @xmath37 , the field would be gaussian , and therefore , equation ( 9 ) implies that for a gaussian field , @xmath46 would be @xmath11-independent",
    ". on the other hand , for a utmost intermittent field , which consists only the most singular structures , and the fluctuations between the singular structures are zero , @xmath46 should be equal to @xmath53 regardless of @xmath7 . from equation ( 9 ) , the utmost intermittent field should have @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath1 is to measure the level of intermittency : non - intermittency corresponds to @xmath55 , and the strongest intermittency corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath1 can also be seen with the following hierarchical relation of @xmath56 @xmath57^{1/\\beta},\\ ] ] which can be derived from equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "equation ( 11 ) is invariant with respect to a translation in @xmath7 . in deriving eq.(11 ) , we assume that the proportional coefficient of equation ( 9 ) is @xmath7-independent . we will show that this assumption is correct .    as mentioned in  2.2 , the @xmath46 measures the clustered structures dominating the @xmath7 order statistics .",
    "the smaller the @xmath7 , the larger the contribution of weak - clustering structures to @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , equation ( 10 ) describes the hierarchical relation between the stronger ( or high @xmath7 ) and weaker ( or low @xmath7 ) clustering . in the scale - free range",
    "where @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 if @xmath50 .",
    "that is , for an intermittent field , weak clustering structures are strongly suppressed with respect to the most singular structures ; the smaller the @xmath1 , the stronger the suppression of weak clustering structures .",
    "the samples for testing the model of  2 are similar to that used in he et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which are given by a hybrid hydrodynamic/@xmath60-body simulation , consisting of the weno algorithm for baryon fluid and @xmath60-body simulation for particles of dark matter ( feng et al . 2004 ) .",

    "we randomly sample 10,000 one - dimensional sub - samples at each redshift .    in order to have a complete description of the density field and avoid false statistical correlation ,",
    "the variable @xmath17 should be given by a proper decomposition of the field @xmath63 .",
    "we will use the decomposition of discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) , which is found to be effective to describe turbulence ( e.g. , farge 1992 ) . with the dwt ,",
    "the variables of mass density field is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the base of discrete wavelet transform ( e.g. , fang & thews 1998 ) .",

    "we will use the harr wavelet to do the calculation below .",
    "we also repeat the calculations with wavelet daubechies 4 .",
    "the non - gaussian statistical features given by daubechies 4 are the same as that of haar wavelet .       with @xmath72 , 4.2 and 8.3 h@xmath0",

    "it is especially important to measure the scale - scale correlation of cosmic baryon matter .",
    "the clustering of cosmic large scale structure in the nonlinear regime essentially is due to the interaction between fourier modes on different scales ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "therefore , cosmic clustering will definitely yield the transfer of the density perturbation powers between different scales , which leads to scale - scale correlation .",
    "scale - scale correlation is also effective to distinguish various hierarchy cascade models ( pando et al .",

    "the non - gaussian features of all these samples can also be well explained with the log - poisson model .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are listed in table 1 , which shows that both the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are increasing with redshift .",
    "the increase of @xmath1 with redshift indicates that the intermittency is stronger at lower redshifts , and the fields at higher redshifts contain less singular structures than that at lower redshifts .    on the other hand",
    ", the increase of @xmath2 with redshift indicates that the singular feature is even stronger at higher redshift .",
    "this probably is because the baryon fluid is significantly heated by the burgers shocks at lower redshift ( he et al .",
    "2004 ) and leads to weaker singular structures .",
    "in the nonlinear regime of cosmic clustering , the dynamical behaviors of either dark matter or baryon fluid are complicated .",
    "nevertheless , it is generally believed that the evolution should be scale - covariant in the range where the dynamical equations and initial perturbations are scale - free .",
    "therefore , hierarchical and universal scaling relations have been widely used to describe the nonlinear clustering .",
    "for instance , the hierarchical relations of irreducible correlation functions and the universal density profile of halos are successful in the description of the statistical features of massive halos of dark matter .",
    "however , it has already been recognized in the early study of cosmic structure formation that in the nonlinear regime the dynamical behavior of cosmic baryon does nt always follow the collisionless dark matter .",
    "the non - gaussianity of the mass and velocity fields of baryon fluid can not be given by a similar mapping of the mass and velocity fields of dark matter .",
    "for instance , the halo model assumes that all mass fields are given by a superposition of the halos on various scales , and all non - gaussian behaviors of the density field are described by the universal density profile ( e.g. , cooray & sheth 2002 ) , this makes it difficult to explain the intermittency and the scale - scale correlation of the transmitted flux in the absorption spectra of qsos .    we show that the evolution of the cosmic baryon fluid , governed by the navier - stokes equation in an expanding universe , is also hierarchical in the scale range in which the dynamical equations and initial perturbations are scale - free .",
    "the non - gaussian behavior of the mass density field of baryon fluid can be well explained by the log - poisson hierarchical cascade model .",
    "the sl formula and/or log - poisson model are universal for the fully developed turbulence of navier - stokes fluid in the scale - free range .",
    "therefore , the result of this paper implies that , in the scale - free range , the cosmic baryon fluid reaches a statistically quasi - steady state .",
    "for a fully developed turbulence , energy passes from large to the smallest eddies and finally dissipates into thermal motion , while the cosmic baryon fluid undergoes the evolution of clustering and finally falls into massive halos of dark matter to form structures , including light - emitting objects .",
    "therefore , the log - poisson model works on the scale range from the onset scale of the nonlinear evolution ( a few tens of h@xmath0 mpc ) to the dissipation scale , i.e. , the jeans length .    in view of this picture , one can say that in the nonlinear regime , the statistical properties of the cosmic baryon fluid are actually less dependent on the details of the dissipative processes . this property has already been noted in describing baryon matter by the burgers equation .",
    "although the burgers equation contains a dissipative term , which leads to the formation of shocks and condense into luminous objects ( jones 1999 ) , the self - similar properties of burgers turbulence actually depend very weakly on the dissipative term .",
    "we now address the possible applications of the log - poisson model .",
    "first , it is interesting to compare the log - poisson model with the lognormal model , which assumes that the pdfs of the cosmic baryon matter is log - normal and no details of dissipative processes are needed ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "the lognormal model is successful to explain some statistical features of ly@xmath3 forests and also predicts that the transmitted flux in the spectra of qsos is non - gaussian and intermittent .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with the observed data ; however , non - gaussian features given by the lognormal model do not quantitatively fit the observed data .",
    "for instance , the high order moment (  3.4 ) given by the lognormal model has a @xmath150 , while the data show @xmath151 ( pando et al .",
    "2002 ) . the later is actually close to the log - poisson model",
    ". therefore , the higher order statistics of the ly@xmath3 transmitted flux would be able to discriminate between the log - poisson and the lognormal model .",
    "second , recent studies have shown that the turbulence behavior of baryon gas can be detected by the doppler - broadened spectral lines ( sunyaev et al .",
    "2003 ; lazarian & pogosyan 2006 ) .",
    "although these works focus on the turbulence of baryon gas in clusters , the result is still applicable , at least , for the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , which is shown to follow the evolution of burgers fluid on large scales ( he et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the last but not least , the polarization of cmb is dependent on the density of electrons , and therefore , the map of cmb polarization would provide a direct test on the non - gaussian features of ionized gas when the data on small scales becomes available .",

    "<S> in the nonlinear regime of cosmic clustering , the mass density field of the cosmic baryon fluid is highly non - gaussian . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , the evolved field of baryon fluid is scale - covariant in the range from the jeans length to a few ten h@xmath0 mpc , in which the dynamical equations and initial perturbations are scale free . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the scale - free range , the non - gaussian features of the cosmic baryon fluid , governed by the navier - stokes equation in an expanding universe , can be well described by a log - poisson hierarchical cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the log - poisson scheme is a random multiplicative process ( rmp ) , which causes non - gaussianity and intermittency even when the original field is gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the log - poisson rmp contains two dimensionless parameters : @xmath1 for the intermittency and @xmath2 for the most singular structure . </S>",
    "<S> all the predictions given by the log - poisson rmp model , including the hierarchical relation , the order dependence of the intermittent exponent , the moments , and the scale - scale correlation , are in good agreement with the results given by hydrodynamic simulations of the standard cold dark matter model . </S>",
    "<S> the intermittent parameter @xmath1 decreases slightly at low redshift and indicates that the density field of baryon fluid contains more singular structures at lower redshifts . </S>",
