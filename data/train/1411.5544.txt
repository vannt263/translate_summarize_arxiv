    "parts of the many - body eigenspectra away from the low - energy sector were generally considered to be irrelevant . in recent years",
    ", the perspective has changed dramatically , largely due to new experimental possibilities with cold atom gases @xcite , which have promoted the study of non - equilibrium situations in _ isolated _ quantum systems @xcite . in an isolated situation",
    ", energy conservation ensures that a system with an initially high energy will not reach the low - energy parts of the spectrum ; the low - energy sector may thus be unimportant .",
    "one well - known example is that of ` repulsively bound ' states of lattice particles @xcite .",
    "eigenstates with particles clustered together have larger energy for repulsive interactions , but bound states may be unable to decay due to energy conservation .",
    "eigenstates with bound nature will determine the dynamics if a system is initially prepared with bound states , even if such eigenstates are high in energy .",
    "the so - called super - tonks - girardeau ( stg ) state , which will be the focus of this paper , concerns the reverse situation of attractive interactions , for bosons confined to one dimension .",
    "now , clustered states are lower in energy , and eigenstates without bound states are high up in energy . again , in isolation , once the system is initiated in a ` gas - like ' state , such high - energy eigenstates determine the dynamics and the lower - energy cluster states play no role . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the lowest gas - like state of a one - dimensional trapped bose gas was excited by starting from the ground state of the gas with repulsive interaction and rapidly switching the sign of the interaction . for large negative magnitudes ,",
    "the lowest gas - like state is called the stg state .",
    "we will extend the definition slightly and refer to the lowest gas - like state at any negative interaction as the stg state .    in this work ,",
    "we study the properties of the stg state and the result of a repulsive - to - attractive interaction quench , in the presence of an explicit harmonic trap .",

    "the continuum lieb - liniger hamiltonian has infinite hilbert space dimension ; we address it by two different approximations with finite hilbert space dimensions : ( 1 ) we approximate it by expressing the multi - particle basis in terms of a truncated basis of single - particle harmonic oscillator eigenstates , and ( 2 ) we study a tight - binding lattice system ( bose - hubbard model ) with a harmonic trap . for these model hamiltonians we characterize the full energy spectrum of multi - boson systems as a function of the two - body interaction . in both systems",
    ", there are eigenstates where some or all particles are ( anti-)bound , so that there is a pronounced , roughly linear , dependence of such eigenenergies on the interaction strength .",
    "eigenstates without such binding have eigenenergies that look mostly horizontal when plotted against interaction .",
    "we refer to the first type as ` cluster ' or ` non - horizontal ' states , and the second type as ` gas - like ' or ` horizontal ' states .",
    "we identify the stg state as the lowest ` horizontal ' state .",
    "we identify the eigenstates that are excited in a repulsive - to - attractive quench .",
    "in addition to the stg state , the important eigenstates are the ground state of the attractive system and the third horizontal state above the stg state .",
    "this latter eigenstate is responsible for setting the breathing mode frequency at large interactions ; we will call it the ` breathing ' eigenstate .",
    "we present the interaction dependence of the frequency determined by this eigenstate , and explain this dependence through an examination of the natures of the first few ` horizontal ' eigenstates .",
    "the breathing mode frequency is twice the trapping frequency , @xmath0 , at zero and @xmath1 interactions . for positive interactions ,",
    "it is known to fall below this value at intermediate interactions @xcite .",
    "the stg state connects to the ground state of the repulsive case at zero and @xmath1 interactions , and therefore also has breathing frequency @xmath0 in these limits .",
    "however , at intermediate attractive interactions , the breathing frequency was predicted @xcite using local density approximation calculations to rise above @xmath0 ; this was observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "our results in this paper give a spectral view of this phenomenon : we are able to identify the eigenstates in the interacting few - body spectrum whose energy difference from the stg state serves as the breathing mode state .",
    "we find that the relevant eigenstate is different for small and large negative interactions : the third ` horizontal ' eigenstate plays this role at large interactions but the ground state plays this role at smaller interactions .",

    "we show that the eigenstate responsible for the breathing is the third horizontal state above the stg state , which has a maximum above @xmath0 ( rather than a minimum below @xmath0 ) at intermediate negative interactions .",
    "this perspective on the breathing mode frequency , based on the eigenspectrum , complements previous studies using local density approximations and sum rules @xcite , and experimental measurements of the breathing mode frequency @xcite .",
    "examining the structure of the eigenstates using the density - density correlations , we arrive at an intuitive argument for the direction of the shift of the breathing frequency from @xmath0 .",
    "examining explicitly the time evolution of the cloud size , we have found that at small negative interactions the breathing frequency corresponds to a different energy difference  the difference between the lowest horizontal state and the ground state of the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bmf_from_time_evol ] ) .",
    "a limitation of the present study is that the effects of finite @xmath13 ( ho hamiltonian ) or finite @xmath21 ( bh hamiltonian ) become severe at larger particle number . in the ho case ,",
    "finite @xmath13 effects affect the cluster states rather drastically ( appendix [ sec : cutoffmdep ] ) . in the bh case ,",
    "finite @xmath21 limitations lead to configurations where the filling is not @xmath89 at the center of the trap , in which case the lattice results do not approximate continuum physics well .",
    "most of our spectral results are obtained from full numerical diagonalization .",
    "sparse matrix methods , which would have allowed access to larger @xmath13 or @xmath21 , are not well - suited to most of the calculations because the relevant energies are not at the bottom of the spectrum , and because the density of states can be large due to the presence of many ` horizontal ' and ` non - horizontal ' states in the same spectral region .",
    "thus , the overlap data in figs .  [ fig : uquenchn6l37 ] and [ fig : overlapspectrumn2m100_02 ] , and the excitation energies in figs .  [ fig : de_n23_02 ] and [ fig : bmf_from_time_evol ] , are shown for @xmath39 or @xmath78 particles . for larger @xmath3",
    ", we observe similar qualitative features , but the corresponding overlaps and energies are generally not quantitatively reliable due to the finiteness effects mentioned above . while our particle numbers ( 2 or 3 ) are small , the numbers in the experiment @xcite ( around 20 ) are far too small",
    "to be justifiably approximated by mean field theories or the thermodynamic limit or local density approximations .",
    "our small - system study of the breathing mode thus provides a valuable counterpoint to previous infinite - number studies .",
    "the present work raises a number of open questions .",
    "first , we have found the breathing mode frequency at small and large interactions to be related to different eigenstates .",
    "this raises the question of which eigenstates are responsible for the breathing mode frequencies in the experiment @xcite .",
    "second , in both our models , we see an intermediate interaction regime where we have multi - frequency breathing oscillations ; an open question is whether a similar effect might be visible in a higher - resolution experiment .",
    "third , we have focused on breathing motion excited by interaction quenches excited by repulsive to attractive quenches .",
    "if the dynamics is excited by small interaction quenches or by small quenches of the trapping strength , one might imagine a different set of eigenstate overlaps , which may lead to differences in the size dynamics or even frequency . finally , the collapse of the breathing mode to zero frequencies for small interactions found in the local density approximation calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite remains a mystery ; it is unclear whether this should be identified with the interaction regime where we see multi - frequency dynamics , or with the interaction regime where the mixing with the ground state is responsible for the breathing dynamics of the stg state .",
    "we thank a.  eckardt , a.  m.  luchli , a.  lazarides , r.  moessner , h .- c .",
    "ngerl , and d.  vorberg for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank r.  moessner for collaboration on related work @xcite .",
    "energy spectrum of the ho hamiltonian for @xmath39 : role of the cutoff @xmath13 . already with a few orbitals ( @xmath90 ) ,",
    "the spectrum contains gas - like states with very weak dependence on interaction @xmath4 ( note logarithmic scale ) .",
    "the avoided level crossings with non - horizontal states are prominent for small @xmath13 .",
    "low lying gas like states , i.e. the stg state , converge for relatively small @xmath13 .",
    "however cluster states are connected to high energy states of the non - interacting system , so that the number and energy of non - horizontal states is affected strongly by @xmath13 . ]",
    "density - density correlation @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "upper panels show the four lowest - energy eigenstates for @xmath93 .",
    "lower panels show the four lowest gas - like states for @xmath94 . ]",
    "the lieb - liniger hamiltonian can be written in second quantization as @xmath95 since the single - particle harmonic - oscillator eigenstates @xmath96 form a complete eigenbasis , the field operators can be expanded in the corresponding mode operators @xmath9 : @xmath97 the hamiltonian then takes the form with @xmath98 and @xmath99 these integrals can be calculated conveniently using summation representations @xcite .",
    "our approximation lies in using a finite number ( @xmath13 ) of single - particle eigenstates .",
    "the @xmath14 basis states can then be chosen to be @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the occupation of the @xmath11-th single - particle orbital and @xmath102 .",
    "[ fig : convergencen2m20_m40 ] visualizes the influence of the cutoff @xmath13 on the energy spectrum of two bosons , by comparing the spectra obtained using smaller and larger @xmath13 for attractive interactions .",
    "we see that the qualitative behavior of low - lying gas - like states is captured already with small @xmath13 .",
    "however for small @xmath13 the stg state has large avoided crossings with cluster states ; this gets corrected with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "there are strong corrections to the cluster states as a function of @xmath13 ; the study of low energy cluster states requires large @xmath13 for @xmath103 .",
    "thus , although we have an energy cutoff in the single - particle basis , the states best approximated are not the lowest - energy many - particle states , but rather the lowest gas - like states .",
    "this method is thus particularly suitable for studying the stg state and its dynamics .",
    "in the main text ( fig .  [ fig : dendencorrn2l100u10_0_001 ] ) , we have described the structure of the lowest gas - like states for @xmath39 in terms of density - density correlation functions .",
    "the order of the two states near @xmath104 excitation , the breathing mode state and the 2nd kohn - tower state , were found to be interchanged between repulsive and attractive cases .",
    "this situation is the same for larger number of particles , although the ddc plots are less straightforward to interpret . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dendenn4l40k0_005u20_02 ] we plot the ddc s for @xmath40 . for each @xmath105 , there are generally three peaks as a function of @xmath20 ( and vice versa ) , indicating the probable positions of the other three particles .",
    "the breathing mode eigenstate can be identified by the presence of a peak at large @xmath106 and its mirror . as expected , this is the third eigenstate in the sequence for @xmath71 , and the fourth for @xmath69 .",
