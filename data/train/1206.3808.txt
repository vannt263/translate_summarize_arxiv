    "one of the most intriguing questions in modern astronomy is how the universe assembled into the structures we see today .",
    "a major part of this question is understanding how galaxies formed over cosmic time",
    ". a popular and rapidly developing method of tracing the evolution of galaxies is through examining galaxy morphologies and structures over a range of redshifts ( e.g. conselice 2003 ; conselice , rajgor & myers 2008 ; conselice et al .",
    "2009 ; lotz 2008 ; cassata et al .",
    "2010 ; ricciardelli et al . 2010 ; weinzirl et al .",
    "while understanding how the morphologies of galaxies evolve , and how matter in galaxies is structured , is fundamental , structural studies of galaxies have thus far focused on measuring properties in one or more photometric bands , and using this as a tracer of evolution .",
    "these types of structural analyses have always been measured in terms of relative luminosities , such that brighter parts of galaxies contribute more towards their structure and morphology . to understand galaxies more fully however , it is important to study the evolution of galaxy structure in terms of their stellar mass distribution , as this better reflects the underlying distribution of stars in a galaxy .",
    "morphological studies have evolved from initial attempts to describe the range of galaxy forms during the early - mid 20th century , towards modern efforts of linking the spatial distribution of a galaxy s stars to its formation history . in the move away from visual classifications ,",
    "the goal has been to quantify galaxy structure / morphology in a way such that structures can be measured automatically and in a reliable way .",
    "there are two broad approaches for automated classification of galaxies - the parametric and non - parametric methods .    in the parametric approach ,",
    "the light profiles of galaxies , as seen in the plane of the sky , are compared with predetermined analytic functions .",
    "for example , single sersic profiles are fit to an entire galaxy s light profile .",
    "similarly , bulge - to - disc ( @xmath8 ) light ratios are computed by fitting two component profiles to a galaxy .",
    "these methods are however unable to parameterise directly any star formation or merging activity which produces random or asymmetric structures within galaxies .",
    "the `` non - parametric '' structural approaches have no such presumed light profiles implicit in their analyses ( e.g. , shade et al .",
    "1995 ; abraham et al . 1996",
    "; conselice 1997 , 2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "this is a more natural approach towards measuring galaxy structures , as the majority of galaxies in the distant universe have irregular structures that are not well fit by parameterised forms ( e.g. conselice 2005 ; conselice , rajgor & myers 2008 ) .",
    "perhaps the most successful and straightforward of the non - parametric systems is the @xmath9 method , which uses a combination of concentration ( @xmath10 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) and clumpiness ( @xmath12 ) values to separate galaxy types ( conselice 2000 ; bershady 2000 ; conselice 2003 ) .    besides overall structure",
    ", the measurement of the size evolution of galaxies , as measured through half - light radii , also has important implications for their formation histories .",
    "for example , many studies such as trujillo ( 2007 ) and buitrago et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have measured galaxy sizes for systems at @xmath13 and have found a population of compact spheroid galaxies with number densities two orders of magnitude higher than what we find in the local universe .",
    "the absence of a significant number of these small sized ( as measured by half - light radii ) , high mass galaxies in the local universe suggests that this population has evolved and has perhaps merged with other galaxies .",
    "however , these studies are measured based on the light originating from these galaxies , and it is not clear whether sizes would change when measured using the distribution of stellar mass rather than light .",
    "all of these methods for measuring the resolved structures of high redshift galaxies depend on measurements made in one or more photometric bands . as such ,",
    "quantitative structures are influenced by a combination of effects , including : regions of enhanced star formation , irregular dust distributions , differing ages and metallicities of stellar populations and minor / major mergers .",
    "the morphology and structure of a galaxy also depends strongly upon the rest - frame wavelength probed ( e.g. , windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ; taylor - mager et al .",
    "young stars , such as ob stars can dominate the appearances of galaxies at blue wavelengths , thereby giving a biased view of the underlying mass within the galaxy .",
    "longer wavelength observations improve the situation , but at every wavelength , the light emitted is from a mixture of stars at a variety of ages and the dust content .",
    "more fundamental is the structure of the stellar mass distribution with a galaxy , as it is more of a direct tracer of the underlying potential .",
    "although galaxy structure has been measured on rest - frame near - infrared and @xmath14-band imaging , which traces stellar mass to first order , we directly investigate the stellar mass images within this paper .",
    "we use the method outlined in lanyon - foster , conselice & merrifield ( 2007 ; lcm07 ) to reconstruct stellar mass maps of galaxies within the goods fields at @xmath0 .",
    "we then use this to investigate the evolution of the distribution of galaxy stellar mass during the last half of the universe s history .",
    "we use these stellar mass maps to directly measure @xmath9 parameters , and the sizes of these galaxies in stellar mass over this epoch .",
    "we test the assumptions that the @xmath9 parameters and sizes can be reliably measured in optical light by comparing the parameters for these galaxies measured in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath6 bands and in stellar mass .",
    "we finally investigate how these various wavelengths and stellar mass maps can be used to classify galaxies by their formation modes , revealing how these systems are assembling .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in   [ sec : data ] and   [ sec : method ] we describe the data , sample selection and method , including explanations of the k - correction code we use and the @xmath9 analysis . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our results , discussing the stellar mass maps themselves , the comparison between galaxy size and the @xmath9 parameters in @xmath6 and mass .",
    "we then explore the relations between the structural parameters in @xmath18 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath6 and stellar mass . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss our conclusions and comment on future applications . throughout",
    "we assume a standard cosmology of _",
    "km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , and @xmath21 = 0.3 .",
    "the primary source of our data consists of hst / acs imaging from the goods acs imaging treasury program .",
    "the observations consist of imaging in the @xmath18 ( f435w ) , @xmath16 ( f606w ) , @xmath17 ( f775w ) and @xmath6 ( f850lp ) pass - bands , covering the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) area .",
    "the central wavelengths of these filters , and their full - width at half - maximum , are : f435w ( 4297 , 1038  ) , f606w ( 5907 , 2342  ) , f775w ( 7764 , 1528  ) , f850l ( 9445 , 1229  ) .",
    "the images have been reduced ( using the acs calacs pipeline ) , calibrated , stacked and mosaiced by the goods team ( giavalisco 2004 ) .",
    "the field is provided in many individual image sections , with the hdf - n data divided into 17 sections , each of @xmath22 pixels .",
    "the total area of the goods survey is roughly 315 arcmin@xmath23 , and we utilise imaging which was drizzled with a pixel scale of 0.03 arcsec pixel@xmath20 , giving an effective psf size of @xmath24 in the @xmath25band .",
    "the sample consists of galaxies selected in the goods - n field with @xmath26 and a f814w magnitude of @xmath27 .",
    "the sample was also restricted to those galaxies with data in all four acs photometric bands such that we can subsequently obtain the most accurate k - corrections and stellar masses possible .",
    "the final sample consists of 560 objects , which were individually cut out of the goods - n acs imaging , and handled as separate entities .",
    "this is described in detail in the following section .",
    "photometric redshifts are available for the whole sample ( mobasher 2004 ) , and spectroscopic redshifts are available for 404 out of 560 galaxies , as found by the team keck redshift survey ( tkrs ; wirth , 2004 ) .",
    "when spectroscopic redshifts are available they are used , else the photometric values are substituted .",
    "to create stellar mass maps of our galaxies , each pixel in each galaxy image is treated individually throughout the analysis .",
    "we convert fluxes from counts per pixel to apparent magnitudes per square arc - second for each pixel in every image in all four photometric bands , as well as calculating their associated errors .",
    "pixels with negative fluxes were assigned values four orders of magnitude smaller than the typical flux so that even pixels with low signal - to - noise values can be mapped .",
    "this however means that our resulting values for the cas parameters , especially asymmetry which uses the background light to do a correction , are potentially different than when measured using optical light .    because our galaxies are at a variety of redshifts , we have to carry out fitting to each sed for each pixel to calculate the stellar mass within each pixel .",
    "k - corrections and stellar masses are calculated for each pixel of each image using the `` k - correct '' code of blanton & roweis ( 2007 ) .",
    "this is similar to previous methods outlined by lanyon - foster et al .",

    "the code , k - correct naturally handles large datasets , and through its interpretation of the data in terms of physical stellar population models , outputs results in terms of stellar mass and star formation histories ( sfhs ) of each galaxy .",
    "the code allows the input of goods data and outputs a stellar mass for each object .",
    "the code can also be modified so as to treat each pixel as a separate input object , which we do in this work .    the k - correction ( @xmath28 ) between bandpass @xmath29 , used to observe a galaxy with apparent magnitude ( @xmath30 ) , at redshift @xmath31 , and the desired bandpass @xmath32 is defined as ( e.g. , oke & sandage 1968 ) :",

    "the k - correct software contains model templates in electronic form and an implementation of the method to fit data to models .",
    "the code uses the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and contains training sets of data from galex , sdss , 2mass , deep2 and goods .",
    "the code finds the nonnegative linear combination of @xmath39 template star formation histories that best match the observations using a minimum @xmath40 comparison . with the entire set of galaxy observations available ,",
    "k - correct also fits for the @xmath39 template sfhs using a nonnegative matrix factorisation algorithm .",
    "k - correct naturally handles data uncertainties , missing data , and deals with the complications of observing galaxy spectra photometrically , using broadband filters of galaxies at varying redshifts .",
    "we use a set of 485 spectral templates to fit to our galaxy pixel seds using bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models with the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf and padova ( 1994 ) isochrones .",
    "all of the six metallicities available ( mass fractions of elements heavier than he of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are used .",
    "some of the known areas of uncertainty in the stellar population models are in the uv and ir regions . in the uv light from young or intermediate aged stellar populations can dominate the flux at @xmath43 . in the near - ir , thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars dominate the flux in some intermediate age populations ( maraston , 2005 ) .",
    "we discuss this issue in terms of stellar masses in conselice et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who show that the effects of tp - agb stars do not kick in until at redshifts higher than the scope of this study ( @xmath44 ) , and thus are not a concern in the present work .",
    "results are outputted from k - correct for each input pixel , giving rest - frame fluxes at @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath29 , @xmath14 magnitudes plus their associated errors , mass - to - light ratios in all of these bands and finally the stellar mass in that pixel .",
    "we then reconstruct the image of the galaxy in stellar mass based on these calculations across the galaxy .",
    "we use a signal - to - noise limit of s / n @xmath49 per pixel in stellar mass for all optical bands , for a reliable calculation .",
    "we also investigate how the results would change if pixels are summed together , finding similar results with the exception of the asymmetry which tends to decrease at lower resolutions .",

    "we have derived the classification system by applying the most appropriate criteria to this particular dataset .",
    "the classification scheme is divided into nine categories , ranging from compact objects ( spherical with little or no apparent envelopes ) to obviously merging systems ( with evidence of tidal streams and other merger attributes ) .",
    "six objects in the catalogue were found to be unresolved and these were removed from the sample .",

    "the compact es are generally found at lower redshifts , at @xmath51 with a few between @xmath52 .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these compact es is their small sizes , with half - light radii of @xmath53 kpc .",
    "the elliptical galaxies are amongst the most popular and important galaxy type in our study , as they are typically the most massive galaxies in the local universe .",
    "one reason for this is that elliptical galaxies , and massive galaxies in general , are the test - bed for understanding theories of galaxy formation which often have strong predictions for how the most massive galaxies should form ( e.g. , bertone & conselice 2009 ) .",
    "the ellipticals we see at high redshift are likely the progenitors of the massive ellipticals found today .",
    "galaxies with the familiar features of nearby _ elliptical galaxies _ were classed as such , and given the label  e \" . 28 e galaxies were identified , which at first glance have the appearance of early types , but on closer inspection and by varying the image contrast had some peculiar features , such as multiple nuclei or minor disturbances in the internal structure .",
    "these objects were classified as _",
    "peculiar ellipticals _ , and are labelled as pe ( conselice 2007 ) .      objects with a disc - plus - bulge structure were classified as _ early - type spirals _ (  es \" ) if the bulge appears larger than the disc component , and _ late - type spirals _ (  ls \" ) if the disc is larger than the central bulge .",
    "edge - on disc galaxies are denoted by  eo \" .    the spiral galaxies are amongst the most interesting for this study given that they often contain two major stellar population types segregated spatially .",
    "traditionally this is seen as an older stellar population making up the bulge , and the spiral arms consisting of younger stellar populations .",
    "objects that did not fit easily into any of the previously defined categories , but whose segmentation map showed them to be singular , or unconnected to any apparently nearby object in the image , were classified as _ peculiar _ ,  pec \" .",
    "these are galaxies that could possibly have merged in the recent past .",
    "galaxies whose morphology also ruled them out from any previously defined class but whose segmentation map showed them to be connected to , or associated with , at least one other object on the image , but without obvious merger signatures , were classified as _ possible mergers _ (  pm \" ) . galaxies with the pm requirements and which showed obvious signs of merging , such as tidal tails , were classified as _ mergers _ (  m \" ) .",

    "the radius of each individual galaxy within the postage stamp image / mass map is measured on the stellar mass map , and we define all our indices within the petrosian radii ( e.g. , petrosian 1976 ; bershady 2000 ; conselice 2003 ) . the petrosian radius has been found to be a better are more reliable radius ( and reproducible ) than the isophotal radius ( petrosian 1976 ) . the limits and relationship to other radii is described in detail in terms of total light in a galaxy by graham et al .",

    "the centre of rotation is found using an iterative process , which locates the minimum asymmetry .",
    "a correction is made within the stellar mass maps for this parameter , as it was found that uncertainties in the mass - to - light ratio adversely affected the asymmetry measurement .",
    "we found that approximately 15 percent of the stellar mass in the asymmetry calculation is left over from random fluctuations in @xmath50 .",
    "this was compensated for including an addition correction for this uncertainty through a slight additional subtraction to the asymmetry signal .",

    "we measure the background light in the same way as for the light measures of asymmetry , although because we are dealing with a conversion to stellar mass , which is not trivially done for the background , we have some background values which are lower than zero . to deal with this , we placed all the negative pixels in the stellar mass map background to zero .",

    "also , the clumpiness is highly sensitive to resolution or seeing , although the acs imaging we use at these redshifts is within the range where values can be properly compared to nearby calibration data sets ( conselice 2003 ) .",

    "one issue that we must address within this paper is how well we are measuring structure on the stellar mass maps for our sample of galaxies , and importantly how the measurement of stellar mass structure would change with redshift due only to cosmological effects .",
    "this is critical if we are to make any inferences of the evolution of galaxies in terms of their stellar mass distribution over time .",

    "we simulate how our stellar mass map creation process , and cas measurements would vary as a function of redshift due to a decrease in the signal to noise and resolution .",
    "we carry out this process in the same way we have for the actual galaxies in the goods fields that we analyse in this paper .",
    "we take a sample of 82 nearby galaxies of various types - ellipticals , spirals , and irregulars , convert their flux values to stellar mass .",
    "we also go through the entire process we do on goods , including setting equal to zero the background values with negative stellar masses .",
    "this stellar mass conversion is done after the galaxy is redshifted , so that we are mimicking as much as possible how the real observations and measurements are done .",
    "the simulation itself is done by simulating each image at some redshift z@xmath78 to how it would appear at z@xmath79 , with z@xmath80 z@xmath78 . in our case z@xmath81 .",
    "when carrying out these simulations of placing lower redshift galaxies to high redshifts we calculate first the rebinning factor , b , which is the reduction in apparent size of a galaxy s image when viewed at higher redshift .",
    "the other major factor is the relative amounts of flux from the sky and galaxy , and the noise produced from the galaxy , sky , dark current , and imaging instrument ( e.g. , read noise ) from acs .",
    "the process and details for how these simulations are done can be found in conselice ( 2003 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the surface brightness of the simulated image must be reduced such that the equation ,    @xmath82    holds , whereby the galaxy as observed in one filter , and is simulated in another with central rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath83 and @xmath84 and widths @xmath85 and @xmath85 . in the above equation @xmath86 is the total number of pixels within the galaxy at @xmath31 and p@xmath87 is the average adu counts per pixel .",
    "the calibration constant @xmath88 is in units of erg s@xmath20 @xmath89 @xmath20 adu@xmath20 .",
    "a sky background , and noise from this backgrounds is added to these images by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is background flux in units of in units of adu s@xmath20 . for acs simulations",
    "we take these values from the measured background based on goods imaging ( giavalisco et al . 2004 ) checked to be consistent with the values from the acs handbook .",
    "other noise effects are then added , including read - noise scaled for the number of read - outs , dark current and photon noise from the background .",
    "our resulting images are then smoothed by the acs psf as generated by tiny - tim ( kriss et al . 2001 ) , although using psfs measured from stars give the exact same results .    from these simulated images at redshifts z = 0.5,1 and 2",
    ", we then reconstruct the stellar mass images in the same way as we do for our original galaxies , and then measure the cas parameters on these stellar mass images .",
    "the results of this are shown in figure  [ fig : sim ] for the concentration and asymmetry parameters .",
    "the m@xmath54 and gini parameters however have similar behaviours , as do the galaxy half - light radii .",
    "we find that the clumpiness indices have a similar average difference , but with a much larger scatter .",
    "what we find overall is that the trend with redshift is such that the concentration and asymmetry parameters on average do not change significantly when measured in stellar mass ( figure  [ fig : sim ] ) .",
    "we show in the right panel of figure  [ fig : sim ] the change in c and a when divided into early / late / peculiar types . again , on average there is not a significant change with redshift , although individual galaxies clearly can have significant differences at higher redshift .",
    "we also investigate how our parameters change at each redshift between the stellar mass and the visual images after the simulation .",
    "we find very little difference except that at the highest redshifts of our simulations , at @xmath92 , we find that the average change in the asymmetry parameter changes @xmath93 , such that the stellar mass image is more asymmetric than the optical light one . we also investigate the same quantities that we use in later figures , finding that twice the difference in the asymmetries of the optical and stellar mass image , divided by the sum of these , increases steadily until it reaches a values of @xmath94 at @xmath92 similar to what we see later in this paper for the actual values .",
    "however at @xmath95 we find that this change is less and closer to @xmath96 .",
    "the following sections describes the analysis of our sample , and what we can learn from examining their structures in stellar mass maps , and how this evolves over time .",
    "we first examine the distribution of visual classifications for our sample and their global colours . we later describe the stellar mass maps we construct for these galaxies , and",
    "then finally present a structural analysis of these systems based on the distribution of their stellar mass .      in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we show the observed colour magnitude diagram for our sample . each morphological class is plotted as a different symbol ; solid red circles represent the ce s , open red circles show the pe galaxies and the e galaxies are represented by red stars .",

    "edge - on disk galaxies are represented by black diagonal crosses and solid green triangles show the pec systems .",
    "pm and m galaxies are represented by open green triangles and open green stars respectively .",
    "this key is used throughout the rest of the paper in the various figures .",
    "based on this , we find that our classified early - type galaxies are on average redder and brighter than the peculiars and pm / m systems , while the spirals tend to be bluer across a range of brightnesses , but the differences are not so clear as would be expected for a sample at low-@xmath31 only",
    ". this colour - magnitude diagram does not show such an obvious morphological sequence as is seen for purely hubble type galaxies in the nearby universe ( e.g. , conselice 2006b ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath97 colour and redshift is shown in figure  [ fig : colz ] .",
    "the symbols are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] . as can be seen",
    ", there is a general trend for all types to become redder with increasing redshift , which is an expected feature of redshift .",
    "the early types are reddest across the whole redshift range , followed by the es and ls galaxies , with the pec / pm / m systems the bluest across all redshifts .",
    "the compact ellipticals are blue and faint .",
    "note however that some pm and es galaxies are quite red .",
    "what this reveals is that there is a decoupled relation between the colour and morphologies of galaxies not seen in nearby galaxies where this correlation is strong .",
    "a specific morphological type as measured visually at high - z can not be used to predict the colour of the galaxy .      by calculating stellar mass to light ratios and the stellar mass within each pixel of each galaxy image in our sample , we reconstruct the image of each galaxy in terms of stellar mass and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we do this for each galaxy , using the method described in lcm07 , and present five representative examples for each classification in figures  [ fig : massmap_ce ] to  [ fig : massmap_m ] .",
    "this figures present galaxy images in @xmath6 ( left ) , stellar mass ( centre ) and @xmath98 ( right ) , which we discuss below .",

    "these galaxies appear similar in their stellar mass maps as they do in their @xmath6 images at first glance .",
    "the mass - to - light maps are not as uniform , and there are important quantitative differences between the stellar mass and light images .",
    "for example , the galaxy 18246 appears to have a relatively higher ( @xmath50 ) in its core compared to its outer parts , whilst galaxy 25035 appears to have a low ( @xmath50 ) in its centre , suggesting that it has a bluer core , likely due to star formation .",
    "galaxy 36503 contains a high ( @xmath50 ) ring surrounding a blue core .",
    "five examples of the peculiar elliptical ( pe ) galaxies are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_pe ] .",
    "these galaxies appear more diffuse in stellar mass than in @xmath6 , in part due to the loss in contrast in the stellar mass maps , but also due to their blue inner colours ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_pe ] ) . as can be seen in the ( @xmath50 ) ratio maps of these galaxies , they have blue cores , and the effect is most pronounced in 22932 and 27429 .",
    "these galaxies also have blue overall colours compared to pure e galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colz ] ) .",
    "these peculiar ellipticals have been seen and studied before in papers such as conselice et al .",
    "they generally have a high asymmetry , and are found amongst the most massive galaxies in the universe at @xmath99 . as can be seen in the m / l maps for these systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_pe ] ) , these galaxies also have a diversity in how young and old stellar populations , including dust , are distributed in these systems compared to normal elliptical galaxies .      figure  [ fig : massmap_e ] presents five examples of early - types from our sample .",
    "these galaxies appear more diffuse and more distributed spatially in their stellar mass than in the @xmath6 band , especially at large radii .",
    "these galaxies have larger ( @xmath50 ) ratios in their centres , except for 36419 , which is blue , and has a more complicated structure in ( @xmath50 ) than the others .",
    "overall , the e galaxies morphologically have very similar structures in stellar mass and @xmath6 .      figures  [ fig : massmap_es ] and  [ fig : massmap_ls ] show the @xmath6 , stellar mass and ( @xmath50 ) maps for the early - type , and late - type spirals .",
    "as found in lcm07 , structures within discs , including prominent spiral arms , are often ( but not always ) smoothed out in stellar mass .",
    "this is true for early types as well as late - type spirals , as can be seen for example in galaxy 25465 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_es ] ) .",
    "inspection of the ( @xmath50 ) maps reveal that the discs of many spirals are bluer than their bulges , as expected .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio maps of the edge on galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_eo ] ) are mostly homogeneous in structure",
    ". however , the maps of 19280 , 39312 and 49722 all show some patches of low @xmath50 . indeed",
    ", 19280 appears to be blue across the whole image , which would imply that the dust content of this galaxy is low , which is unusual for edge - on galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : massmap_pec ] shows the f814w images , stellar mass maps and m / l ratio maps for the peculiar galaxies within our sample .",
    "the peculiar galaxies 22690 and 25584 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_pec ] ) appear to contain objects near the primary galaxy , but in both cases it is the larger galaxies on the right that is the target .",
    "although 22690 looks disturbed in @xmath6 , the effect of smoothing in the stellar mass map is also seen here .",
    "this indicates that disturbed regions of the galaxy are due to star forming regions .",
    "the @xmath6 image of 22690 does not have the regular morphology of a nearby spiral galaxy , although the stellar mass map has a structure one would expect of such a galaxy , having a central bulge surrounded by a smooth disc .",
    "the ( @xmath50 ) map also shows a red central region surrounded by bluer pixels .",
    "the mass - to - light maps of the peculiars generally show that they are blue and also difficult to see in stellar mass , due to their low mass to light ratio .",
    "this suggests that star formation itself might be difficult to trace in stellar mass .",
    "however , the stellar mass in the pm galaxy 18917 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_pm ] ) traces the light in the galaxy , despite having a low ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "note also that the peculiars are often peculiar spirals , in the sense that they look like nearly normal spirals , but with some peculiar features .",
    "often these peculiars are quite small as well , and many of them are very likely spirals in some type of formation .    the merging galaxy system 21839 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_m ] ) is similar in stellar mass to its @xmath6 image , but possesses a more intricate structure in ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light map shows the smaller merging object to be blue , whereas the brighter galaxy appears more red but with blue regions in its core .",
    "the system 29800 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_m ] ) , whilst clearly appearing to be a merger between two galaxies of approximately equal brightness in @xmath6 , would likely be classified as a disc galaxy in stellar mass .",
    "the bottom of the two bright nuclei has disappeared completely in the stellar mass image , although it is visible as a low ( @xmath50 ) patch in the mass - to - light map .      in this section",
    "we compare how the distribution of stellar mass in a galaxy compares to the distribution of light as seen in the @xmath6 acs imaging .",
    "one of our goals is to determine how appropriate studies in @xmath6 and similar red bands are for measuring the mass content and structure of a galaxy , and how stellar mass quantitative morphologies differ from those measured in light .    in this section",
    "we investigate the relationship between galaxy properties in stellar mass and @xmath6-band light . for galaxy size ( as measured by the half - light radius ) and the @xmath9 parameters we plot the normalised difference between @xmath6 and stellar mass versus the mean value of @xmath6 and stellar mass as a representative figure to determine how these various quantities change .",
    "one of the basic features of a galaxy is its size , which in this paper we quantitatively mean the half - light radii .",
    "galaxy half - light radii are found to strongly evolve with time , such that galaxies at higher redshifts have a more compact structure ( e.g. , ferguson et al . 2004",
    "; trujillo et al . 2007 ; buitrago et al . 2008 ; carrasco et al .",
    "however , every size measurement has been carried out through measurements of light , and it is desirable to determine how the half - mass radii of galaxies measured in stellar mass maps compares with half - light radii measured using light .    as such , we have calculated half - light ( or half - mass ) radii ( @xmath100 ) , in kpc , for our sample in both stellar mass and @xmath6 light , and investigate whether half - light / mass radii are comparable .",
    "we define the normalised size difference as    @xmath101/[r_{\\rm e}(z_{850})+r_{\\rm e}(m_{*})],\\ ] ]    and the average size as    @xmath102.\\ ] ]    we use these two calculations so as to avoid biasing the analysis when the values become very small in either the stellar mass image , or in the @xmath6 band .",
    "we plot the relation between these values in figure  [ fig : size_cf ] .",
    "the horizontal dashed line marks the position of equal size ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , and the average dispersion for the sample is represented by the black square points on the right of the plot .",
    "the larger black square points in the figure show the average values and the measured dispersion for the ranges of @xmath104 between zero and one kpc , one and two kpc , up to six kpc .",
    "this convention is used for each of the parameter comparisons in sections  [ sec : conc_cf ] to  [ sec : m20_cf ] .",
    "we note that there is a steady progression for increasing average galaxy size with morphology , from the compact ellipticals , early types and early spirals to the late - type spirals , with the peculiars and edge - on galaxies being more randomly distributed .",
    "the points are scattered about the line of equality such that nearly half ( 42 percent ) of the galaxies have @xmath105 .",
    "there is , therefore , a slight tendency for sizes in masses to be higher , but this does not vary significantly with average galaxy size and type ( see table  2 ) .",
    "there is no clear tendency for any particular morphological type to be larger in either the @xmath6 or stellar mass image , which suggests that there is no bias introduced by using measurements in @xmath6 band data for size measurements ( trujillo 2007 ; buitrago et al .",
    "table  [ tab : size_cf ] .",
    "shows that the average difference between the sizes in the stellar mass maps and the @xmath6-band image is essentially zero , demonstrating that the measurements of half - radii in light does not differ significantly from the measurements in the distribution of stellar mass .",
    "we also examine the normalised difference in size against ( @xmath16 - @xmath6 ) colour to test whether there is a tendency for bluer galaxies to have larger radii in stellar mass than in light .",
    "this is what we might expect to find if star formation dominated the light near the centre of the galaxy .",

    "the average concentration , in both @xmath6 and stellar mass , is generally high for the early types , and lower in the late - types and peculiars , with the early - type spirals being spread between low and high values .",
    "the compact elliptical galaxies have a low average concentration , due to the light being spread evenly across a galaxy s pixels .",
    "the average trend shows that the ratio @xmath125 is slightly lower in the stellar mass maps for the early types compared to the @xmath6 band concentration .",
    "we find that in general r@xmath126 is lower and r@xmath54 is higher , compared to those in the @xmath6-band image , although the effect is mostly due to a smaller r@xmath126 although this effects is quite small .",
    "it is possible that stellar mass is less centrally concentrated towards the centre of the galaxy in the early - types ( raising r@xmath54 ) , and/or the stellar mass is more diffuse at larger radii than the distribution of light ( lowering r@xmath126 ) .",
    "it is also the case that for many galaxies more star formation is seen in the outer regions of the galaxies in the @xmath6-band , but these pixels are less dominant in stellar mass , raising the value of r@xmath126 creating higher values of @xmath10 as seen .     band and within stellar mass maps .",

    "first , the lowest asymmetry values for the sample are negative in all bands , mainly due to the background correction which for very symmetric galaxies will sometimes be larger than the asymmetry in the galaxy itself .",
    "this has the effect , as seen in figure  [ fig : asym_cf ] , of skewing the low average asymmetry values differences for the smallest stellar mass measured asymmetries . as can be seen in figure  16 , except for these galaxies with low asymmetry values",
    ", there is a clear tendency for galaxies to be more asymmetric in stellar mass than in @xmath6 , this being the case for a large fraction of the non - early type sample .",
    "the stellar mass maps also have a greater spread in asymmetry values than @xmath6 , and this can be more clearly seen in   [ sec : ac ] .",
    "however , we also note that the blue regions of galaxies are not so well traced by the stellar mass maps , and often led to difficulties with the image contrast , making the galaxy features harder to see , as in the case of the late - spiral 19535 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_ls ] ) .",
    "further galaxies , such as 38722 ( figure  6 ) , are clearly more asymmetric and lopsided when viewed in the stellar mass band . in this case",
    ", it appears that one spiral arm remains while the other disappears .",
    "there are several reasons why the asymmetry value in the stellar mass maps is higher than in the images .",
    "first , when calculating @xmath11 , noise tends to be magnified due to the process of subtracting images .",
    "the simulations discussed in  3.4 show that there is a tendency for the average galaxies to become more asymmetric in stellar mass measurements than in light .",
    "this can explain part of this , but we find that the average difference of around @xmath127 in the relative difference is too high to be accounted for solely by these redshift effects .",
    "we discuss some of the reasons for why the asymmetries will be higher in the stellar mass maps than in light .",
    "when calculating stellar masses for each pixel we assume that the @xmath50 ratio is approximately constant in the surrounding pixels .",
    "this should be the case for early type galaxies , especially , due to their uniform stellar populations . to test how much this variance in @xmath50",
    "could be affecting the @xmath11 values , we have measured the @xmath50 pixel variance in a typical early type galaxy ( 30976 , fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_e ] ) .",
    "the mean @xmath50 for a pixel in this galaxy is @xmath128 with a typical standard deviation in the surrounding pixels of @xmath129 .",
    "although a correction has been applied to minimise this effect ( see  3.3.1 ) , it is not enough to account for the high asymmetry signal in the spiral galaxy stellar mass maps , and thus this asymmetry is likely a real effect due to the nature of the calculation of this parameter , and especially the background , as described in  3.3.1 .     and stellar mass .",
    "the points and conventions are the same as in figure  12 .",
    "note that the asymmetry in the stellar mass is lower than the @xmath25band for only the early types .",
    "this is due to the method of measuring the asymmetry , where the sky background is handled in a different way than for imaging , resulting in higher values for later type galaxies (  4.3.3 ) .",
    ", width=340,height=340 ]    to further understand why late - type spiral galaxies are more asymmetric in stellar mass than @xmath6 , we have examined these galaxies in detail and present four examples of the late - type sample in both @xmath6 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : spirals_z ] ) , and stellar mass maps .",
    "two of these galaxies have low asymmetries in both stellar mass and @xmath6 ( 25751 and 21448 ) , and galaxy 21448 in particular , demonstrates the smoothing of spiral arms , which we observed previously in nearby galaxies ( lcm08 ) .",
    "however , two of these galaxies have higher asymmetries in stellar mass than in @xmath6 ( 19535 and 34946 ) .",
    "object 19535 , especially , shows little relation in stellar mass to the @xmath6 image .",
    "the star forming knots and central bulge , which can be seen clearly in @xmath6 , translate to large scale asymmetries in stellar mass .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this effect",
    ". the star forming regions in 19535 could truly be more massive per pixel than the surrounding disk , due to the high masses and densities of gas and dust required to form such massive star forming regions .",
    "this would lead to such regions not being smoothed out in stellar mass , causing higher @xmath7 values .",
    "it is also possible that what we have interpreted as star forming knots in the disk in some cases could be minor merger signatures , that is , low - mass galaxies falling into the object itself .",
    "there is also a trend with morphological - type with increasing asymmetry such that early types have low asymmetry and late - types higher asymmetry .",
    "our findings confirm previous studies who found similar trends ( e.g. conselice 2000 ) .",
    "we have also investigated the relation between asymmetry in stellar mass and @xmath130 colour , and examine this after splitting into two redshift bands : @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "there is a clear trend for galaxies with a higher degree of asymmetry to be blue , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this trend has also been found for asymmetries measured in light ( conselice 2003 ) .         and stellar mass .",
    "the points and conventions are the same as in figure  12.,width=340,height=340 ]     parameter in @xmath6 and stellar mass .",
    "the points and conventions are the same as in figure  12 . because of the inverse nature of m@xmath54 , galaxies with positive differences on the y - axis are those with more ` concentrated ' light profiles than in the stellar mass maps.,width=340,height=340 ]      the clumpiness values in stellar mass maps have a higher degree of uncertainty , as discussed in section 3.3.3 .",
    "overall , we find a trend for clumpiness to be greater in stellar mass than @xmath6 , and this is the case for 91 percent of the sample .",
    "however for larger values of average @xmath12 , there is a trend such that @xmath135 .",
    "the clumpiness parameter is similar to asymmetry , but picks out small scale features , such as compact star clusters , as opposed to large scale asymmetries .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that uncertainties in @xmath50 cause a large number of the sample to have @xmath136 , as variations in @xmath50 from pixel to pixel filter through in the calculation of @xmath137 .",
    "such variations affect @xmath7 and @xmath137 more than the other parameters , as these calculations involve the subtraction of images , which amplifies the @xmath50 variations and large variations of level within the background .",
    "figure  [ fig : gini_cf ] shows the comparison between the values of the gini parameter in stellar mass and the @xmath6 band .",
    "although the early - types are more strongly clustered around equality , @xmath138 , there is a clear trend for the sample to have higher @xmath70 in stellar mass , with @xmath139 in non - early types within our sample .",
    "this comparison of @xmath140 and @xmath141 displays a greater separation between types .",
    "the late - type spirals show an approximately even spread in gini values , from  0.45 to  0.93 , but all of these have a higher difference between @xmath6 and stellar mass than the early - types and compact ellipticals .",
    "figure  [ fig : gini_cf ] reveals that the gini index is higher within the stellar mass maps than in the @xmath6 band , except for early - type galaxies , indicating that most of the stellar mass in later morphological types is contained within fewer pixels within the stellar mass image . this is a significant difference between the early and late - types in our sample .",
    "the reason for this is that the bright blue regions of these galaxies vanish as the m / l ratio is inversely proportional to l. this creates effectively a mass distribution with a larger fraction of the mass contained within fewer pixels .",
    "for example the bulges become more prominent for the late - type disks while the arms vanish .",
    "the bulges in these systems become more prominent and this will rise the value of the gini index .    what can often been seen in stellar mass maps of late - types and mergers / peculiars",
    "is that these bright outer regions vanish , leaving only the central part of the galaxy including most objects in figure  6 which loose their outer parts and appear almost as early - types .",
    "figure  18 also shows that the gini index for the early - types in stellar mass and light are similar , likely because of the small variation in the m / l ratios of the various pixels .",
    "we show the differences between the m@xmath54 index in the stellar mass maps and the @xmath6 band in figure  [ fig : m20_cf ] . due to the reversed parity in the m@xmath54 values , points which lie above the dashed line in figure  [ fig : m20_cf ] have m@xmath142 m@xmath143 , that is , the stellar mass is more more diffuse than the light for most systems .",
    "this would change however if we used a smaller radius than the standard definition .",
    "overall , m@xmath144 is higher ( less negative ) than m@xmath143 for most of the sample .",
    "the m@xmath54 parameter traces the brightest 20 percent of the flux in the galaxy , or the greatest 20 percent of the stellar mass .",
    "this parameter is heavily weighted by the spatial distribution of the most luminous , or most massive , pixels , but is normalised to remove any dependence on galaxy size and total flux / stellar mass . m@xmath54 , like @xmath70 , is also not dependent on a fixed , pre - determined centre .",
    "therefore , if stellar mass exactly follows light within a galaxy we would expect that m@xmath144 = m@xmath143 .",
    "figure  [ fig : m20_cf ] shows that , while this is approximately the case for early - type galaxies and early spirals , the same does not apply for peculiars , late - type spirals and edge - on discs .",
    "the compact ellipticals especially differ from this trend , having m@xmath144 @xmath145 m@xmath54(@xmath6 ) .",
    "this is certainly due to the fact that these compact ellipticals have blue cores which render their stellar mass maps more compact in the centre than for galaxies with redder cores .",
    "we examine how galaxies fall in the classic concentration - asymmetry plane ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2000 ) to determine if different galaxy types , as determine visually can be better separated at different wavelengths in this parameter space .",

    "galaxies to the left of the middle line in figure  20 & 21 , are labelled mid - types and those to right of this line are classified as late - types .",
    "these criteria for identifying mergers and late - types appear more appropriate for our sample in the @xmath17 and @xmath6 bands , while galaxies are more mixed in these regions in stellar mass , having many more galaxies with high asymmetries , and spirals are not easily distinguished from merging systems . however , the uniqueness of the early - type region is more obvious in stellar mass maps , with most e galaxies in the @xmath17 and @xmath6 band plots falling into the mid - type region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ac_mass ] ) .",

    "this makes it difficult to distinguish between morphological types in stellar mass within @xmath147 . however , given the fact that many of these spirals appear to have some kind of merger or formation mode , the stellar mass structure is superior for finding galaxies in active evolution .",

    "we have already discussed in  4.3.3 how the late - type spiral galaxies have stellar mass asymmetries larger than their asymmetries in optical light . since the late - type spirals are galaxies which have arms / disks that are larger / brighter than the bulge component , these galaxies are therefore dominated in terms of their light by their spiral structures and arms .",

    "this interpretation of stellar mass being more localised than the light is consistent with a higher gini index in the stellar mass bands than in the light .",

    "it is likely that some of our highly asymmetric late - type spiral galaxies are similar , or in the same class as these clumpy spirals .",

    "we find that the gini index in stellar mass is higher than in the z - band ( @xmath139 ) for all galaxies except the early - types , indicating that most of the stellar mass in later morphological types is contained within fewer pixels .",
    "late - type and peculiar morphologies show a trend for m@xmath144 @xmath158 m@xmath143 , suggesting that the brightest @xmath159 percent of the brightest pixels is not necessarily where the greatest @xmath159 percent of the stellar mass is located .",
    "v. we investigate the relations between several combinations of the @xmath9 parameters in @xmath2 and stellar mass , and compare our results to previous morphological studies of this type ( e.g. conselice , rajgor & myers 2008 ; lotz 2004 ; 2008 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath6 is the most appropriate photometric band to utilise for a @xmath0 sample of galaxies with all morphologies , although stellar mass maps are better at distinguishing active galaxies from passive ones and is more a physical measure of structure .",

    "@xmath186    although this divide is very successful in separating early - types from pec / pm / m systems , the spirals are spread over these two regions , again implying that measuring structural parameters in stellar mass does not distinguish between morphologies as well , although it traces physical processes better .    however , it is possible that viewing the stellar mass distribution of galaxies reveals different physical processes to those we expect to see in light .",
    "we have already discussed the possibility that some highly asymmetric late - type spirals in our sample could be in the process of forming bulges .",
    "it is also possible that studies in stellar mass could provide clues as to the formation mechanism involved .",
    "the asymmetric late - type spirals , for example object 19535 ( figs .  [ fig : massmap_ls ] ,  [ fig : spirals_z ] ) , could be undergoing outside - in formation , perhaps through the accretion of smaller satellites .",
    "we could , therefore , be picking out systems experiencing minor merging events .",
    "at the start of this paper we describe how we classified each of our galaxies into one of nine type (  3.2 ) . in this section , we described , based on our stellar mass map analysis , the properties of each of these galaxy types in terms of their optical and stellar mass structures , and what these imply about the evolution of different classes of galaxies .",
    "while galaxy classification in terms of overall visual morphology is limited ( conselice 2006b ) , it is still useful for connecting galaxies at different redshifts , and for understanding how major nearby galaxy types such as disks and ellipticals are formed .",
    "below we give details on the properties of each of the nine galaxy type that we have examined within goods .",
    "compact ellipticals are typically found in the late - type area of the c - a optical light diagram , but are within the early - type region of the c - a stellar mass diagram .",
    "the clumpiness values for these systems are also zero in all wavelengths and stellar mass due to the fact that these systems are so small this parameter can not be reliably measured .",
    "the concentrations of these systems are always quite low , with @xmath187 , at the resolution limit where we can measure these values , suggesting that they are not similar to giant ellipticals ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "some interesting features appear when we compare the quantitative properties of ces as measured in optical light to those in stellar mass maps .",
    "one of these is that for all ces , the size measured in the stellar mass maps are always larger than for those measured in the reddest band , @xmath6 . the asymmetry measured in stellar mass maps is also quite low , and lower than in the , perhaps due to the fact that the asymmetric light is brought to a lower level within the stellar mass images compared to the optical light .",
    "the m@xmath54 parameter is also quite different between the stellar mass maps and the , such that m@xmath54 is higher ( less negative ) in the .",
    "this implies that the light distribution is more concentrated in the stellar mass maps , likely due to the blue coloured core .",
    "first , we find that just based on colours , there is a wide diversity at a given redshift ( see figs . 12 and 13 ) - an indication that at higher redshifts there is a range of elliptical galaxy star formation histories , something that has been recognised for some time ( e.g. , stanford et al .",
    "2004 ; conselice et al .",
    "2007 ) . simply based on the c - a diagram with optical light ( fig .",
    "20 ) it appears that most of the early - types are found in the region of c - a space classifiable as mid - types .",
    "this is commonly seen for high redshift ellipticals which appear more asymmetric than their @xmath188 counterparts ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "ellipticals do have generally lower gini and m@xmath54 indices , however there is still some spread in their values .",
    "the stellar mass maps reveal that ellipticals appear to become more ` diffuse ' within stellar mass maps .",
    "however the sizes are either very similar in stellar mass maps or even slightly smaller , than in the corresponding @xmath6-band image .",
    "the gini and the m@xmath54 parameters do not change significantly between the stellar mass maps and the @xmath6-band image . however , we find that some of the ellipticals are slightly more asymmetric in stellar mass maps than in the @xmath25band , although many of these systems tend to be bluer galaxies .",
    "the ellipticals also tend to become less concentrated in stellar mass compared with the @xmath6 band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conc_cf ] ) .    finally , the elliptical galaxies are one of the few types which do not change significantly in terms of their gini and m@xmath54 values between stellar mass and the @xmath6 , and this results in these systems having a well defined location in the stellar mass gini / m@xmath54 diagram ( fig .  [",
    "fig : gm20_mass ] ) .",
    "the peculiar ellipticals are a galaxy type which has been recognised to exist up to at least @xmath189 before ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "these peculiar ellipticals appear elliptical in overall morphology , but have internal structure suggesting that they have recently undergone some type of assembly .",
    "these galaxies are not uncommon , and are more often seen than the compact elliptical type .",
    "these galaxies are more asymmetric and less concentrated than the es - with all having concentrations , @xmath190 .",
    "they are quite distinct from the ellipticals in the ca plane and are bluer by @xmath191 magnitudes from the giant ellipticals .",
    "these blue features can be readily seen within the m / l maps for these systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_pe ] ) .",
    "these galaxies often appear more elliptical in the stellar mass maps once their m / l variations have been taken into account .",
    "another difference between the pes and the es is that these systems have half - light ( or half - mass ) radii which are nearly always bigger in the stellar mass maps than in the @xmath6 band .",
    "this is a sign for star formation activity in the cores of these galaxies , since the bluer material in the core is less prominent in the stellar mass maps , giving them a larger effective radius .",
    "this can also be seen in the fact that the asymmetry in the stellar mass maps is generally higher than in the @xmath6 band for these systems , which is another indication that they are undergoing some form of star formation .",
    "the gini values for these systems are higher in the stellar mass band than in @xmath6 , which demonstrates that the stellar mass distribution is more concentrated in bright ( but non - central ) pixels than the light , as the light is less equally distributed than the stellar mass .",
    "the location of the pes is similar to that of the es in the gini / m@xmath54 plane .",
    "the spiral galaxies are amongst the most interesting for this study given that they often contain two major stellar population types segregated spatially .",
    "traditionally this is seen as an older stellar population making up the bulge or centre , and the spiral arms consisting of younger stellar populations .",
    "we find that the early - type spirals , those whose apparent bulge is brighter / larger than its apparent disk , are quite blue in colour .",
    "this difference is very obvious when examining the m / l ratio maps for these galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massmap_es ] ) , although the differences are not as obvious as with the late - type spirals .",
    "nevertheless , these systems often appear to have a blue outer m / l ratio and a redder inner one , although there are examples where this is not the case",
    ".    the sizes of these galaxies does not change significantly between the stellar mass maps and the @xmath6 band images .",
    "there are however some differences between the stellar mass maps and the @xmath6 band images within the various parameters .",
    "the most significant of these is that the asymmetry parameter is higher in the stellar mass maps than in the @xmath6 band imaging as discussed in detail in  4.3.3 .",
    "the gini parameter is also higher within the stellar mass maps than within the @xmath6 by roughly 10 percent .",
    "this implies that the stellar mass is distributed in fewer pixels than in the light for spirals .",
    "the distribution of m@xmath54 values is similar between the light and stellar mass , suggesting that the spatial distribution is similar .",
    "one notable feature of the spiral galaxies in general is that they have a much larger range of asymmetry values within the stellar mass images .",
    "in fact , their values are often as high as the peculiar galaxies , suggesting that within stellar mass maps these parameters can not easily distinguish between mergers and spirals with mixed stellar populations .",
    "the peculiars , pre - mergers and mergers all have similar patterns in the cas space in both the stellar mass maps and within the @xmath6 diagrams .",
    "these are the most asymmetric and bluest galaxies in our sample , and are likely in some phase of a merger , as has been described earlier in e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2008 ) .",
    "these peculiars ( a term we use here for all three of these types ) do not change in size much between the stellar mass and the @xmath6 image .",
    "however , the asymmetry in the stellar mass band is higher than for the @xmath6 band .",
    "this is likely due to the stellar mass within these galaxies being more concentrated in fewer locations .",
    "the m@xmath54 also shows that the light is less concentrated in than the stellar mass , showing that the stellar mass is more distributed spatially than in light , suggestive of a merging systems .",
    "in fact , these peculiars have the highest asymmetries , m@xmath54 , and gini indices ."
