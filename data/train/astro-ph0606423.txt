    "galactic outflows play an important role in the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "supernova explosions in galaxies create galactic winds , which deposit energy and metal - enriched gas into the igm .",
    "these outflows are necessary to explain many observations and to solve many problems in galaxy formation , such as the high mass - to - light ratio of dwarf galaxies , the observed metallicity of the igm , the entropy content of the igm , the abundance of dwarf galaxies in the local group , the overcooling problem , and the angular momentum problem .",
    "high - resolution , gasdynamical simulations of explosions in a single object reveal that outflows generated by such explosions tend to be highly anisotropic , with the energy and metal - enriched gas being channeled along the direction of least resistance , where the pressure is the lowest @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several observations support the existence of anisotropic outflows ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indirect support for the existence of anisotropic outflows comes from the observed enrichment of systems around the mean density of the universe @xcite and the enrichment of systems far from known galaxies at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it may be challenging to enrich such regions with isotropic outflows even with the inclusion of enrichment from poorly understood population iii stars .",
    "early indications are that population iii stars are unlikely to pollute the igm to a large extent @xcite .",
    "anisotropic outflows may also provide an explanation for part of the observed scatter in the metallicity in the igm , which is still unexplained @xcite .",
    "several simulations of galactic outflows in cosmological contexts have been performed",
    ". typically , these simulations use cubic comoving volumes of size @xmath5 , containing thousands of galaxies .",
    "the methods used can be divided into two groups : analytical methods and numerical methods .",
    "the analytical methods describe the expansion of outflows in simulations that are either gaussian random realizations of the density power spectrum or n - body simulations combined with prescriptions for galaxy formation .",
    "outflows are represented using an analytical solution ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter sb01 , @xcite ) that currently assume isotropy .",
    "the numerical simulations use hydrodynamical algorithms such as sph , and outflows are generated in a variety of ways : by imparting sph particles with a large velocity component ( e.g. @xcite ) , depositing additional thermal energy into sph particles ( e.g. @xcite ) , or taking output from completed sph simulations and calculating , _ a posteriori _ , the propagation of outflows into the igm @xcite . unlike the analytical methods cited above , which assume isotropic outflows , all these numerical approaches have the potential to generate anisotropic outflows .",
    "however , we believe that there are some limitations to these numerical approaches , which motivates us to introduce an analytical model for anisotropic outflows .    with any sph simulation , we need to be concerned with the limited resolution of the algorithm .",
    "consider for example the simulations of @xcite .",
    "these authors identify galaxies of radius @xmath6 , and rearrange the sph particles located between @xmath6 and @xmath7 into two uniform , concentric spherical shells located at radii @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are then given an outward velocity .",
    "the outflow is therefore initially isotropic but becomes anisotropic as it propagates into a non - uniform external medium .",
    "we can see two potential problems with this approach .",
    "firstly , the structure responsible for generating the anisotropy might be the galaxy or its environment , in which case the rearranging of particles into concentric shells would erase that structure entirely . secondly , 52 particles per shell ( the number they used ) provides a good covering of the solid angles initially , but as the outflow expands and the particles in the shells move apart they become more like individual pressure points pushing on the external medium , and this could lead to an artificial mixing of the outflow and the external medium by raleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the approach of @xcite is radically different .",
    "it consists of identifying galaxies in an output from an sph simulation and calculating the propagation of outflows from these galaxies in @xmath10 different directions .",
    "since the resistance encountered by the outflows will be direction - dependent , outflows will start isotropic but then become anisotropic as the distance travelled by outflows will vary with direction .",
    "there are two limitations to this approach .",
    "firstly , since it uses the output of an sph simulation and introduces the outflows _ a posteriori _ , the feedback effect of these outflows can not be simulated ( i.e. outflows do not influence the formation of other galaxies ) .",
    "secondly , in this approach gas elements move radially and encountering high - pressure gas will dissipate their energy and rapidly slow down . in the real universe , that gas element will likely acquire a tangential velocity component that will redirect it towards regions where the resistance of the external medium is weaker .    to overcome these various limitations and study anisotropic outflows in a cosmological context , _ including the effect of feedback",
    "_ , we have designed an analytical model for galactic outflows .",
    "this can then be combined with either an analytical method or a semi - analytic method for the description of galaxy formation . in this paper",
    ", we use an analytical monte carlo method .",
    "calculations performed with an n - body semi - analytic approach will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "this paper is set out as follows . in  2 , we describe our analytical model for anisotropic outflows . in  3 , we describe our monte carlo method for cosmological simulations .",
    "results are presented in  4 , and their implications are discussed in  5 .",
    "conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "consider a density field with a local density maximum at some position , @xmath11 .",
    "a halo may collapse at that point and may go on to form a galaxy , which will then produce an outflow .",
    "our goal is to design an analytical model for the geometry and evolution of this outflow that takes into account the physical properties of the galaxy , the density distribution of the matter surrounding the galaxy , and the global properties of the igm .    using the high - resolution simulations and the observations of galactic outflows as a guide , we will represent outflows as `` bipolar spherical cones . '' in a spherical coordinate system @xmath12 , the outflow occupies the volume defined by @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radius of the outflow and @xmath18 is the opening angle .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "0.8 in   is the time - dependent radius of the outflow , @xmath18 is the opening angle , and @xmath19 the direction of the outflow.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the limit @xmath20 , the outflow becomes spherical , and is entirely described by the radius , @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath21 , the outflow is anisotropic , and two additional parameters must be specified : the opening angle @xmath18 , and the direction of the outflow , which is defined by a unit vector @xmath19 . hence , our model of anisotropic outflows is a 3-parameter model .",
    "one possible way to describe our model phenomenologically is to imagine that the outflow starts isotropic , with all the matter moving radially , but the parts of the outflow that encounter high - resistance from the external medium acquire a transverse velocity and get redirected into the directions where the resistance is weaker . in this context , we see that our model and the model of @xcite represent two limiting cases . in their model ,",
    "the energy of the gas expanding into dense regions is entirely dissipated . in our model , that energy is entirely funneled into the less - dense regions .",
    "it is not clear what value one should be using for the opening angle .",
    "the simulations of @xcite and @xcite show that the angle actually varies as the expansion proceeds .",
    "it starts at a low value , @xmath22 near the site of the explosion . once the outflow reaches the low - density ( around or below the mean density of the universe ) regions it `` fans out '' , and the opening angle increases to values @xmath23 , or even larger .",
    "the radius also varies with opening angle .",
    "hence , our representation of outflows as bipolar spherical cones of fixed opening angle is a convenient simplification . until we have a better understanding of the morphology of the outflows ( something that would require more precise simulations )",
    ", we will treat the opening angle as a free parameter that can take any value from @xmath24 ( the isotropic limit ) to @xmath25 ( the jets limit ) , keeping in mind that the larger values are likely to provide a more accurate description of the outflows once they reach the low - density regions .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the opening angle will vary for individual outflows on a case - by - case basis due to their differing driving pressure .",
    "we treat the chosen value as a typical opening angle with an aim to reproducing the global properties of anisotropic outflows for a cosmological volume .",
    "the outflows are expected to take a path of least resistance out of a galaxy that forms at the location of a density peak . in the current literature ,",
    "two characteristic scales for this path of least resistance have been considered : the galactic scale , in which a disk may form @xcite , and larger scale filamentary or pancake structures @xcite . in the former case , outflows are directed along the rotation axis of the galaxy . in the latter",
    "the pressure of the surrounding medium determines the direction of the outflow .",
    "we have selected the latter as the defining scale , upon which our anisotropic outflows are based , for the following reasons :    * it is unclear if the galaxy has already formed a well - ordered disk by the time much of the initial starburst has occurred .",
    "outflows may start while the galaxy is still in the process of assembling .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formations suggest that starbursts take place during a chaotic merger events at high redshift , before a disk has assembled @xcite . * despite recent results suggesting their rotation axes tend to lie preferentially parallel to the plane of pancake structures ( @xcite , and references therein ) the orientation of these disks are largely randomized .",
    "averaging over all outflowing galaxies , only a weak directionality is expected before the effect of larger scale structures begins to dominate as the outflows continue to expand .",
    "*   the importance of disk - scale effects is dependent on the locations of sne within the disk .",
    "bipolar outflows due to sne explosions in a disk are a result of the relatively high pressure gradient along the rotational ( minor ) axis compared to the major axis .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume , therefore , that for off - center sne , where the relative difference in pressure gradient is less acute , the outflow will be less bipolar .",
    "figure  [ pancake ] shows an intermediate stage of a simulation @xcite of an explosion inside a dwarf galaxy that is forming at the intersection of two emerging filaments inside a cosmological pancake .",
    "this simulation was performed with an adaptive sph algorithm @xcite with @xmath26 gas and @xmath26 dark - matter particles .",
    "the outflow is clearly anisotropic , bipolar , and propagates in the direction normal to the pancake plane .",
    "interestingly , the central region where the explosion takes place has a nearly isotropic density profile .",
    "hence , it is the anisotropy of the outer regions that results in an anisotropic outflow .    in our monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we assume that galaxies form at the location of local density peaks in the matter distribution , and we determine the direction of the outflow by finding the direction of least resistance in the vicinity of that peak .",
    "we discuss in greater detail the concepts of `` peaks '' and `` vicinity '' in ",
    " 3.2 and 3.3 below .",
    "consider a local density maximum located at some point , @xmath11 , inside the computational volume .",
    "we center a cartesian coordinate system @xmath27 on that point , and perform a taylor expansion of the density contrast up to second order , @xmath28    0.25 in     this expression contains no linear terms since the density is a local maximum . in practice , we consider the density distribution inside a sphere of radius , @xmath29 , centered on the point , @xmath11 , and perform a least - square fit of equation  ( [ del1 ] ) to determine numerically the values of the 6 coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . once these coefficients are determined , we rotate to a new coordinate system @xmath36 , such that the the cross - terms vanish .",
    "equation  ( [ del1 ] ) reduces to @xmath37    it is actually straightforward to perform this change of coordinates .",
    "we combine the coefficients of equation  ( [ del1 ] ) to form the following matrix , @xmath38\\,.\\ ] ]    we then diagonalize this matrix .",
    "since this matrix is real and symmetric , all three eigenvalues are real .",
    "these eigenvalues are the coefficients @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , respectively , and the 3 corresponding eigenvectors give us the directions of the three coordinate axes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the three coefficients @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are always positive , otherwise the point , @xmath11 , would not be a maximum , but rather a saddle point or a minimum .",
    "each coefficient is a measure of how fast the density drops as we move away from the peak in the direction corresponding to that coefficient .",
    "therefore , the largest coefficient corresponds to the direction along which the density drops the fastest .",
    "we will interpret this as being the direction of least resistance , and assume that the outflow will naturally follow that direction .",
    "for instance , if @xmath40 happens to be the largest of the 3 coefficients , then the outflow will be directed along the @xmath43-axis .      in this section ,",
    "we present the equations describing the expansion of the outflow . the technique used for solving these equations",
    "is shown in appendix  a.      tegmark , silk , & evrard ( 1993 , hereafter tse ) presented a formulation of the expansion of isotropic outflows that was based on previous work by numerous authors @xcite and refined it to account for the expansion of the universe . in this formulation",
    ", the injection of thermal energy produces an outflow of radius , @xmath45 , which consists of a dense shell of thickness @xmath46 containing a cavity .",
    "a fraction , @xmath47 , of the gas is piled up in the shell , while a fraction , @xmath48 , of the gas is distributed inside the cavity .",
    "we normally assume @xmath49 , @xmath50 , that is , most of the gas is located inside a thin shell .",
    "this is called the _ thin - shell approximation_.    the original equations of tse have been refined by several authors ( @xcite ; sb01 ; @xcite , hereafter sfm ) to include various additional physical processes .",
    "hence , there is not a `` unique '' form of the equations . in this paper ,",
    "the evolution of the shell radius , @xmath45 , expanding out of a halo of mass , @xmath51 , is described by the following system of equations , @xmath52    where a dot represents a time derivative , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the total density parameter , baryon density parameter , and hubble parameter at time , @xmath56 , respectively , @xmath57 is the luminosity ( discussed in  2.3.3 ) , @xmath58 is the bubble pressure resulting from this luminosity , and @xmath59 is the external pressure of the igm .",
    "the four terms in equation  ( [ rdotdot ] ) represent , from left to right , the driving pressure of the outflow , drag due to sweeping up the igm and accelerating it from velocity @xmath60 to velocity @xmath61 , and the gravitational deceleration caused by both the expanding shell and the halo itself .",
    "the two terms in equation  ( [ pdot ] ) represent the increase in pressure caused by injection of thermal energy , and the drop in pressure caused by the expansion of the outflow , respectively . for details ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and tse .",
    "these expressions most closely resemble that of sfm , the one difference coming from their use of a radially dependent mass in the last term of equation  ( [ rdotdot ] ) , derived by assuming a nfw profile @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the gravitational drag on a spherical outflow expanding out of a spherical collapsed halo , and is no longer an adequate description in the case being examined since an anisotropic outflow will more rapidly escape an elliptical halo .",
    "the influence of the gravitational potential well will be an intermediate case between this and a point mass . in practice we take the simpler form by assuming a point mass , as in sb01 .",
    "we justify this approximation as follows : early in the outflow lifetime the effect of gravity on the outflow is negligible compared to other effects ( see appendix  a ) . as the outflow expands , the gravity terms eventually become important , by which time most outflows have left the halo from which they originate .",
    "notice that the original formulation of tse did not include the term @xmath62 , and also ignored the external pressure @xmath59 .",
    "these equations provide a full description of isotropic outflows .",
    "we now modify these equations to describe anisotropic outflows with any value of the opening angle , @xmath18 .",
    "we impose the condition that the modified equations reduce to equations  ( [ rdotdot ] ) and  ( [ pdot ] ) in the isotropic limit @xmath24 .",
    "first consider equation  ( [ pdot ] ) .",
    "the two terms in the right hand side correspond to the increase in pressure caused by thermal energy injection , and the decrease in pressure caused by the expansion of the outflow , respectively . at this point",
    ", we need to backtrack .",
    "equation  ( [ pdot ] ) was derived from the following system of equations ( tse ) : @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the thermal energy inside the outflow , and @xmath65 is the volume of the outflow .",
    "we take the time derivative of equation  ( [ et ] ) , and eliminate @xmath66 using equation  ( [ etdot ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath67    if we now substitute @xmath68 , we recover equation  ( [ pdot ] ) . however , a bipolar anisotropic outflow with opening angle , @xmath18 , has a volume given by @xmath69    we substitute equation  ( [ volume ] ) in equation  ( [ pdotgen ] ) , and get @xmath70}-{5\\dot rp\\over r}\\,.\\ ] ]    physically , as @xmath18 decreases , the energy is injected in a smaller volume , resulting in a larger pressure , @xmath58 .",
    "this equation replaces equation  ( [ pdot ] ) . in our model , this is the only modification we need to make to the equations describing the expansion of the outflow ( although a modification to the luminosity will be required ) .",
    "equation  ( [ rdotdot ] ) remains unchanged .      the external pressure , @xmath59 , depends upon the density and temperature of the igm , which can be quite complex .",
    "but in the context of the analytic approximation we are using , we are justified in making some simplifying approximations .",
    "following @xcite , we will assume a photoheated igm with a fixed temperature , @xmath71 .",
    "we will also assume an igm density , @xmath72 , equal to the mean baryon density , @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite performed detailed hydrodynamical calculations of the equation of state for a photoheated igm , and showed that the temperature is a function of the density . but",
    "according to their figure  1 , a temperature of @xmath74 is appropriate for densities , @xmath75 .",
    "it should also be noted that the temperature of the igm is redshift - dependent as shown by @xcite and we will neglect this here .",
    "our choice of fixed external temperature and density will be discussed further in  5 .",
    "the external pressure is then given by @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the redshift , @xmath78 is the mean molecular mass , and subscripts 0 indicate present values .",
    "the value of @xmath78 depends upon the ionization state of the gas .",
    "we assume that hydrogen is ionized @xcite and helium is singly - ionized in the redshift range @xmath79 @xcite , which is most of the redshift range in which our outflows are actively expanding . also , even when much of the igm is still neutral , it is reasonable to expect the source galaxy to have photoionized the region ahead of the outflow .",
    "we will assume that this is the case throughout the simulations .",
    "the mean molecular weight is then @xmath80 ( atomic mass units ) . for a helium abundance , @xmath81 @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath82 .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath57 , is the rate of energy deposition or dissipation within the outflow and is a sum of five terms , @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the total luminosity of the supernovae responsible for generating the outflow , @xmath85 represents the cooling due to compton drag against cmb photons , @xmath86 represents the cooling due to 2-body interactions , @xmath87 represents the cooling due to ionization , and @xmath88 represents heating from collisions between the shell and the igm .",
    "following sfm , we will assume that the first two terms , supernovae and compton drag , dominate , and will neglect the remaining terms .",
    "the supernovae luminosity , for a galaxy forming in a halo of mass , @xmath51 , is given by @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the fraction of the total energy released that goes into the outflow , @xmath91 is the star formation efficiency , and the total mass in stars formed during the starburst is @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is the mass of stars required to form one sn and we take a value of @xmath94 ( derived using a broken power - law imf from @xcite ) and the energy released by each of these sne is @xmath95 .",
    "@xcite show that for instantaneous star formation , as considered here , the sn outflow phase associated with this burst last for a duration of @xmath96 and the delay before the first sne is negligible .",
    "we use the galaxy mass dependent determination of @xmath90 given by sfm , @xmath97 , where @xmath98100\\tilde{n}_t^{-1 } , &   $ 100 \\le \\tilde{n}_t$;\\cr } \\ ] ]    and @xmath99 .",
    "the ionization state inside the outflow is even more uncertain and may be a function of distance from the source as the gas may recombine as it expands from its source galaxy . until we have a more precise model for the internal structure of the outflow",
    ", we will simply make the same assumption as for the surrounding igm : ionized hydrogen and singly - ionized helium .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the extreme case , where outflows contain fully ionized gas , involves only a minor modification of the compton drag . following tse ,",
    "the compton luminosity is given by @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the thompson cross section , @xmath102 is the cmb temperature , and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the electron number density and temperature inside the bubble , respectively .",
    "the pressure , @xmath58 , inside the bubble is given by @xmath105    we assume that hydrogen is ionized and helium is singly - ionized and hence @xmath106 , which is also the approximation made in tse . equation  ( [ et1 ] ) becomes @xmath107 .",
    "we now eliminate @xmath108 in equation  ( [ lcomp ] ) .",
    "we also eliminate @xmath65 using equation  ( [ volume ] ) , and get @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the present cmb temperature .",
    "we used @xmath111 , which is valid over the range of redshifts we consider .",
    "the expansion of the outflow is initially driven by the supernovae luminosity .",
    "after the supernovae turn off , the outflow enters the `` post - supernova phase . ''",
    "the pressure inside the outflow keeps driving the expansion , but this pressure drops since there is no energy input from supernovae .",
    "eventually , the pressure will drop down to the level of the external igm pressure .",
    "at that point , the expansion of the outflow will simply follow hubble expansion . since we assume identical mean molecular weights inside and outside the outflow , the condition @xmath112 implies @xmath113 .",
    "figure  [ out001 ] shows the isotropic outflow solution for a halo of mass , @xmath114 that collapses at redshift , @xmath115 , in a @xmath1cdm universe .",

    "initially , during the supernova phase , the outflow is driven by the energy input from supernovae and the radius steadily increases . during this phase , the supernova luminosity , @xmath84 ,",
    "exceeds the compton luminosity by factors of several and for this particular outflow dominates it entirely .",
    "the pressure diverges at the redshift of supernova turn - on ( because we neglect the finite volume of the region containing the supernovae ) , but then drops as @xmath119 ( see appendix  a ) . at @xmath120 ,",
    "the supernovae burn out , and the only contribution to the total luminosity is the energy loss by compton drag . the outflow enters the post - supernova phase .",

    "this will happen if there is a peak @xmath178 for which @xmath208    in this case , the halo was able to form , but did not manage to cool before being destroyed , hence the actual galaxy never formed .",
    "if the galaxy does manage to form , we neglect the formation time and life span of massive stars and so the newly formed galaxy immediately produces an outflow centered at the halo position , @xmath209 , and propagating along the direction , @xmath210 .",
    "we evolve this outflow with time , using the solutions given in appendix a ( with timesteps corresponding to our redshift steps , @xmath205 ) .",

    "they may enrich these systems with new metals , possibly modifying their cooling time .",
    "they may also expel the gas content of the object by ram pressure stripping or shock - heating of the gas .",
    "of these two mechanisms , the former ( stripping ) is the dominant one @xcite and so we will neglect the latter .",

    "we assume that stripping may only occur for systems that have not collapsed since the cross section to impact is small and would result in negligible momentum transfer .",
    "this approach is supported by @xcite who investigate this issue with a numerical analysis of an individual object struck by a shock .",
    "it is also worth noting that we deal with baryonic stripping in the same way whether or not the source galaxy is within the filtering radius of the density peak struck ( although it is less likely to occur due to the larger escape velocity and mass of the halo struck ) .",
    "when the criterion for stripping is met , the density peak is rendered free of baryons and , while it may collapse , it will not form a galaxy .",
    "if the shell of the outflow does not strip the peak then the peak is enriched by the metal - rich gas , which fills the outflow .",
    "metals are propagated throughout our simulations within the hot bubbles of outflows .",
    "peaks that have not been struck by outflows are assumed to have metallicity of @xmath223=-3 $ ] , which is negligible for the purposes of calculating the halo cooling time . once galaxies are formed metals are produced at rate of @xmath224 per sn @xcite .",
    "hence the mass of metals in the outflow is @xmath225    where @xmath226 is the fraction of ism gas blown out with the outflow .",
    "we use the value @xmath227 taken from the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "this mass of metals is distributed evenly throughout the volume of the outflow .",
    "it is notable that , in this model , the ratio of the mass lost rate to star formation rate is approximately @xmath228 .",
    "this is consistent with observations that indicate this ratio is of order 1 for local starburst galaxies ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , infrared - luminous galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and high-@xmath77 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when an outflow strikes an uncollapsed density peak and does not strip it , it modifies its metal content .",
    "it deposits a fraction of its metals , @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is a mass deposition efficiency , which we set at @xmath231 , @xmath232 is the volume of overlap of the uncollapsed density peak of radius @xmath163 , and @xmath233 is the volume of the outflow .",
    "this volume of overlap is calculated based on various geometric approximations to the overlap of two spherical cones and a sphere , depending on their relative size and orientation .",
    "once the halo has collapsed , the addition of metals results in an increase in cooling rate and so a reduction in the cooling time , expediting galaxy formation .",
    "we assume that the sne in our simulations are only of the type  ii variety since these sne explode together shortly after the starburst and lead to a coherent extragalactic outflow that will reach large distances . as a result",
    "we use an alpha - element - rich yield of metals [ quoted in @xcite as `` primordial '' abundance ratios ] and distribute our mass of metals accordingly .",

    "there is a special case to consider where a source galaxy is embedded in the density peak that its outflow strikes . in this case",
    "we assume the volume overlap of the outflow is 100% and so it will deposit a fraction , @xmath230 , of its metals onto this structure .",
    "the main motivating factor behind the inclusion of this mass deposition efficiency is to avoid the implausible scenario that an outflow may continue to grow having left all its metals behind .",
    "the value it should take is unknown ; however , the simulations are not sensitive to this factor , as we point out below .",

    "we are aware of no direct observational constraints ; although our ratio of @xmath273 is consistent with observation by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others .    the value for the efficiency with which outflow metals are deposited upon collapsing density peaks , @xmath230 , is poorly constrained and requires further analysis .",
    "this is not a concern here as the metal enrichment of halos does not have a significant impact on the subsequent numbers of galaxies and volume of the igm enriched .",
    "only a handful of additional galaxies form before @xmath155 , with the inclusion of increased cooling by metal enrichment , that would otherwise not have formed ( i.e. if @xmath274 ) .",
    "all density peaks that are enriched , and that will collapse to form galaxies in our simulations , will form earlier .",
    "this raises the distance traveled by outflows whose expansion is halted either by merger of the source galaxy or the end of the simulation run .",
    "the volume enriched falls by less than @xmath275 , when reducing the deposition efficiency from @xmath231 to @xmath274 .",
    "where the outflows stall before their radii are larger than the pre - collapse scale of their density peaks , we can reasonably assume that the outflows will fall back and galactic fountains will be formed . since we allow all our outflows to join the hubble flow when the internal pressure equals the external pressure , we have not attempted to simulate this effect .",
    "this will not change our results to a significant degree as this is the case in a small minority of our outflows .",
    "even in those few cases , no stripping or metal enrichment of other peaks occur and they fill only a small fraction of the universe so making little impact on the volume filling factor statistics shown .    in the calculation of external pressure",
    "we assume helium is singly - ionized , which is true for most of the redshift range where the outflows affect the igm and will have little effect on the pressure .",
    "we also assume that the igm is at the mean density and temperature and that the mean temperature is not redshift dependent .",
    "the density of the igm is also implicitly assumed to be constant in the second term of equation ( 4 ) corresponding to the drag due to the sweeping up of the igm ( see tse for more details ) .",
    "most of the enriched volume is in underdense regions for all opening angles considered as shown in figure 9 ( discussed below ) and the temperature of the igm will be lower than that at mean density . both these factors lower the external pressure , and so we can expect outflows to travel further after this correction .",
    "outflows that only travel a short distance , such that they do not escape overdense regions , will travel even shorter distances as a result .",
    "a further complication arises since the outflows themselves will raise the temperature of the igm .",
    "we will seek to investigate these issues in future work .",
    "we assume that the igm is ionized in our calculation of the compton drag on expanding outflows .",
    "this appears to be reasonable since recent _ wmap _ results indicate that the epoch of reionization is @xmath276 @xcite while outflows before @xmath277 have a negligible impact on our results .",
    "the results from the previous section consistently indicate that we successfully describe anisotropic outflows that take a path of least resistance out of overdense regions , such as pancakes and filaments , and into voids .",
    "if sufficiently anisotropic ( @xmath278 ) these outflows will also begin to strike neighboring overdense structures and further peaks .",
    "the number of peaks hit drops for anisotropic outflows and diminishes the ability of these outflows to strip peaks of their baryons .",
    "this reduces the capacity of ram pressure stripping at high-@xmath77 to explain the abundance of dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "we find a value for the volume filling factor of @xmath271 ( for @xmath272 ) , but this is sensitive to a number of factors such as the star formation efficiency and the degree of clustering of source galaxies .",
    "we will present a more thorough analysis of the value of this quantity in future papers in this series .",
    "we do , however , expect its dependence on opening angle of outflows to be rigorous .    despite this small volume filling factor",
    ", we find significant enrichment of underdense systems ( below the mean density of the universe ) , particularly when these outflows are anisotropic .",
    "the volume filling factor of enriched underdense systems is maximized by an opening angle of @xmath279 , this is @xmath280 higher than that for isotropic outflows , while the volume of enriched space below @xmath269 is @xmath268 higher .",
    "this may provide an explanation for observations ( at high-@xmath77 ) of metal enrichment in systems at , or around , the mean density as seen in @xcite and @xcite without the need to appeal to large volume filling factors .",
    "these outflows also reach larger distances from their source galaxies and help explain why metal enrichment is seen far from observed galaxies at high redshift @xcite , while still showing elevated metal enrichment close to those galaxies @xcite .",
    "since parts of the igm are enriched solely based on whether they are located in the path of least resistance of an outflow , this may provide a further source of scatter in the metallicity of the igm observed by @xcite and as yet unexplained in simulations . in a subsequent paper in this series @xcite we will investigate these issues by performing a direct comparison between these observations and synthetic qso absorption spectra produced using our analytic description of anisotropic outflows .",
    "the strongest and weakest points of our method are the high dynamical range and the lack of gravitational dynamics , respectively . on the one hand ,",
    "the ratio of the largest to smallest mass scale we consider is @xmath281 .",
    "it would be very challenging for a numerical simulation to achieve such a large dynamical range in mass ( that is , simulating @xmath282 galaxies _ and _ dwarf galaxies together ) , while having sufficient resolution to properly simulate the outflows originating from the smallest galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the treatment of large - scale structure and galaxy formation in the monte carlo method is quite simplistic .",
    "we combine a gaussian random density field with a spherical collapse model for galaxy formation . in this approach , galaxies form at the comoving locations of density peaks and remain at these locations afterward .",
    "even though we have a prescription for destruction of galaxies by mergers , the actual clustering of galaxies is not taken into account .",
    "if galaxies were allowed to cluster , collision and stripping by outflows would be more frequent , and also it would become more difficult to enrich low - density regions with metals .",
    "this lack of a correct description of dynamics means that the description of clustering of the igm is also limited .",
    "the main limitation of this work is not the outflow model , but rather the monte carlo model used for describing galaxy formation .",
    "this monte carlo model has been used as a test bed for the outflow model in order to perform an investigation of its importance and potential influence . in two forthcoming papers",
    "@xcite , we will replace this monte carlo model by a more realistic numerical simulation of galaxy formation in a cosmological volume .",
    "we have designed an analytical model for anisotropic galactic outflows based on the hypothesis that such outflows are bipolar and follow the path of least resistance through the environment of their source . in this analytical model",
    "we vary one parameter : the opening angle , @xmath18 .",
    "we combined this model with an analytical monte carlo method for simulating galaxy formation , galaxy mergers , and supernova feedback . with this combined algorithm , we study the evolution of the galaxies and the igm inside a comoving cosmological volume of size @xmath0 , from redshifts , @xmath283 , in a @xmath1cdm model .",
    "our main results are the following :    * galaxy formation starts at redshift , @xmath284 .",
    "since we neglect the formation and evolutionary times of massive stars , each newly formed galaxy immediately produces an outflow that lasts for a time , @xmath285 .",
    "such outflows can travel hundreds of kiloparsecs , and eventually collide with other objects .",
    "we neglect the effect of a collision with a well - formed galaxy ( the cross - section is too small ) .",
    "when an outflow collides with a peak still in the process of collapsing , removal of the gas by ram pressure , preventing the formation of the galaxy , occurs about half of the time .",
    "when stripping does not occur , the protogalaxy is enriched in metals .",
    "this process occurs for all opening angles and the proportion stripped or metal - enriched is essentially independent of opening angle .",
    "* when metal - enrichment of a peak occurs and this peak collapses to form a halo , the cooling time of that halo is reduced , and the galaxy forms earlier .",
    "however , this effect is rather small . in particular",
    ", we did not find that metal - enrichment could `` bring to life '' low - mass protogalaxies whose cooling time exceeds the age of the universe .",
    "* anisotropic outflows channel matter preferentially into low - density regions , away from the cosmological structures ( filaments or pancakes ) in which the galaxies producing the outflows reside .",
    "consequently , the number of halos encountered by outflows decreases with decreasing opening angle .",
    "this reduction in the number of hits results in a larger number of galaxies forming , since fewer halos are stripped by the ram pressure of outflows . *",
    "the volume filling factor of galactic outflows ( that is , the volume fraction of the igm occupied by outflows ) holds constant and then decreases with opening angle . for angles @xmath286 the constant filling factor is a result of the balance between an increase due to larger numbers of galaxies and a decrease due to a fall in volume per outflow . at smaller angles ,",
    "the volume of individual outflows drops significantly with @xmath18 , and the total filling factor decreases since this term wins out . *",
    "the decrease in filling factor with decreasing angle is not sufficient to explain the decrease in number of hits .",
    "the ratio ( number of hits)/(filling factor ) decreases with decreasing angles down to @xmath287 .",
    "this indicates that at these angles , the outflows are efficient at avoiding collisions with halos and channel matter preferentially into low - density region . hence , if several halos reside in a common cosmological structure , an outflow produced by one of them will tend to avoid encountering the others . for angles",
    "@xmath288 , we observe the opposite trend : outflows become more efficient in finding halos and hitting them .",
    "these narrow outflows can travel across cosmological voids and hit halos located in unrelated structures , like the next filament or pancake .",
    "this effect is a continuation of a process begun at @xmath289 where the mean distance travelled by outflows when they strip collapsing peaks of their baryons begin to increase as the first neighboring structures are hit . *",
    "the enrichment of the igm with metals favors high - density systems since the sources of outflows are located in high - density regions .",
    "however , as the opening angle decreases , there is a dramatic reduction of the enrichment of such systems , combined with a dramatic increase in enrichment of low - density systems .",
    "anisotropic outflows enrich around 10% larger a volume of the underdense universe ( and @xmath268 more of the universe below @xmath269 ) than isotropic outflows .",
    "this collection of results is a mere consequence of the fact that outflows follow the path of least resistance .",
    "this is an assumption in our model and is motivated by observations as well as high - resolution simulations .",
    "this work benefited from stimulating discussions with a.  ferrara , e.  scannapieco , j.  silk , m.  tegmark , r.  thacker , and s.  d.  white .",
    "all calculations were performed at the _ laboratoire dastrophysique numrique _",
    ", universit laval .",

    "we might have chosen our initial radius at @xmath197 to be any value below the physical size of the star - forming region of the source galaxy ; however , the results are not substantially changed by such an adjustment .",
    "also it is more plausible to expect that the starting point of the coherent outflows is closer to @xmath291 than the radius of the star - forming region , if we assume that the star formation density will be centrally peaked .",
    "most terms in equations ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) diverge at @xmath197 , making it impossible to obtain a numerical solution in this form .",
    "we must first perform a change of variables that will eliminate the divergences in these equations while retaining all the terms . to find the appropriate change of variables , we investigate the early - time behavior of the solution , by taking the limit @xmath292 . in this limit",
    ", we have @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 , and @xmath297 .",
    "the gravity term , hubble terms , and external pressure term are negligible ( in the sense that they diverge slower than the other terms ) , and equation  ( [ rdotdot2 ] ) reduces to @xmath298          in the limit @xmath292 , the three functions @xmath302 , @xmath303 , and @xmath304 vary linearly with @xmath56 .",
    "we stress that this leaves the behavior of the outflow expansion unchanged and will only lead to a well - behaved system of equations at the start of the first time step .",
    "we now eliminate the functions @xmath45 and @xmath58 in our original equations ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) using ( a7)(a9 ) , and get @xmath305s^3}-{5qu\\over st}\\,,\\\\ \\label{sdot2 } \\dot s&=&{u\\over t}\\,,\\\\ \\label{udot2 } \\dot u&=&{9u\\over5t}-{14s\\over25t}+{8\\pi(q - q_{\\rm ext})g\\over\\omega_bh^2s } -{3t\\over s}\\left({u\\over t}-{2s\\over5t}-hs\\right)^2-{\\omega h^2st\\over2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & -{gmt^{11/5}\\over s^2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these equations are completely equivalent to our original equations ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , but all divergences at @xmath197 have been eliminated .",
    "these equations can therefore be integrated numerically using a standard runge - kutta algorithm , with the initial conditions @xmath306 at @xmath197 .",
    "however , before doing so , it is preferable to rewrite the equations in dimensionless form .",
    "we define @xmath307        the quantity @xmath310 appearing in equation  ( [ qtdot ] ) depends on the luminosity @xmath85 , which is given by equation  ( [ lcomp2 ] ) .",
