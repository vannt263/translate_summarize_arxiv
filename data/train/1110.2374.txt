    "the existence of single top production has been established by the d0 and cdf experiments at the tevatron @xmath4 collider  @xcite and the first measurements of individual production mechanisms have recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "three different production mechanisms are foreseen in the standard model ( sm ) @xmath0 channel , @xmath5 channel , and @xmath6 ( or @xmath7-associated ) . in 7  tev proton - proton collisions",
    "the @xmath0-channel mode , is by far the most abundant of the three mechanisms and it is the one with the most striking final state topology .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) computations predict @xmath8  pb in the 4-flavour scheme and @xmath9  pb in the 5-flavour  @xcite , for a top mass of @xmath10 .",
    "we present here first evidence for @xmath0-channel single top quark production in @xmath11 collisions at @xmath12 at the lhc , with a first measurement of the production cross section  @xcite .",
    "the results are based on the data sample sample collected in 2010 by the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment  @xcite , and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of @xmath13 .",
    "this measurement is performed in the leptonic decay channel , in which the w boson decays into an electron or a muon .",
    "the @xmath0-channel production mode is treated as signal and the other two production modes will be considered as background .    after a dedicated event selection , two complementary analyses are performed . in the first analysis ,",
    "referred to as the 2d - analysis , a data driven method using two angular properties specific to @xmath0-channel top quark production will be used . in the second analysis , referred to as the bdt - analysis , the overall compatibility of the signal event candidates with the standard model expectations of electroweak top quark production is probed by using a multivariate analysis technique .",
    "both analyses employ similar reconstruction techniques and selection criteria .",
    "signal events are characterized by exactly one isolated muon or electron and missing transverse energy from the leptonic decay of the @xmath7 boson as well as by one central @xmath14-jet from the top quark decay and an additional light - quark jet from the hard scattering process .",
    "the latter is found most often in the forward direction .",
    "events are required to pass either a single electron trigger or a single muon trigger .",
    "the minimum @xmath15 requirement for the electron trigger ranged from 10 gev to 22 gev , while the minimum @xmath16 requirement for the muon trigger ranged from 9 gev to 15 gev .",
    "the selected data sample is used both for the selection of the signal and for signal - depleted control regions used for data - driven background studies",
    ". therefore no lepton isolation criteria were used at trigger level , in order to allow background estimations based on samples failing these criteria .",
    "after offline reconstruction , events are selected requiring exactly one isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) with @xmath17 and @xmath18 for muons and @xmath19 , @xmath20 for electrons , and exactly two jets ( @xmath19 , @xmath21 ) . in the 2d analysis , only the jets and the missing transverse energy ( @xmath22{\\ensuremath{\\not\\!\\ ! e_{\\mathrm{t}}}}}$ ] )",
    "are reconstructed with the particle flow algorithm  @xcite , while in the bdt - analysis , all objects are reconstructed with the particle flow algorithm .    in order to reduce the large background from @xmath23 light partons , one of the two selected jets",
    "is required to be identified as a b - jet according to the tight selection criteria of the _ track counting _ ( tc ) @xmath14-tagging algorithm  @xcite . to further reduce the background , the 2d - analysisrequires that the second jet is not tagged according to a looser selection criteria , since most of the signal events are expected to have only one @xmath14 quark inside the acceptance of the tracking detectors ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the bdt - analysisdoes not make this requirement in order to increase statistics and profit from the larger separation power of the bdt discriminant .",
    "one the other hand , to remove the kinematic region where the two identified jets are back - to - back , the bdt - analysisrequires the two selected jets to satisfy @xmath25 .",
    "this region is found to be poorly reproduced by the simulation in a sample enriched in @xmath23light partons , affecting some of the observables used in the analysis .    finally , to further suppress contributions from processes where the lepton does not come from a leptonically decaying @xmath7 boson , the transverse mass is required to be @xmath26 for muon events and @xmath27 for electron events .",
    "the transverse mass is defined as @xmath28 where the neutrino momentum vector is assumed equal to the missing transverse energy ( @xmath22{\\ensuremath{\\not\\!\\ ! e_{\\mathrm{t}}}}}$ ] ) .    in data ,",
    "the number of selected events is 72 in the electron and 112 in the muon channels in the 2d - analysis , and 82 in the electron and 139 in the muon channels in the bdt - analysis .",
    "both analyses require the reconstruction of the 4-momentum of the top - quark candidate .",
    "a constrained kinematic fit is used to reconstruct the complete kinematics of the event under the hypothesis that it is a single top event decaying into a lepton+jets final state .",
    "this leads to a quadratic equation in the longitudinal neutrino momentum , @xmath29 .",
    "solutions to this equation can have an imaginary part when @xmath30 is larger than the @xmath7 pole mass used in the constraint .",
    "the imaginary component is then eliminated by modifying the  such as to give @xmath31 , still respecting the @xmath7 mass constraint .",
    "when two real solutions are present , which happens in 77.6% of the cases , the solution with the smallest @xmath32 is chosen , which , in simulated events , is correct in 60.3% of the cases .",
    "choosing the jet with the highest @xmath14-tagging discriminant as the jet originating in the decay of the top quark is correct in simulated events in 92.6% ( 87.4% ) of the cases after the 2d ( bdt ) selection .",
    "the non - tagged jet is matched to the recoil quark in 89.6% ( 84.0% ) of the cases .",
    "with a relatively small signal and a large background , one crucial element of the analysis is the determination of the background .",
    "data - driven methods are thus used to estimate the main backgrounds .",
    "the event yields for the two selections are summarized in table  [ tab : evtyield_with_datadriven ] .",
    "this analysis probes a very specific kinematical phase space populated only by the tails of the qcd distributions .",
    "this , despite the excellent agreement of the cms simulation with data , together with the small number of selected events in the simulation , makes the estimate of this background on simulated events not very significant .",
    "the normalization of this background is estimated by a profile likelihood fit to the @xmath30 distribution after all other selection criteria have been applied , by parametrizing the @xmath30 distribution as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are templates for signal - like ( leptons coming from @xmath7 decays ) and qcd - like events , respectively .",
    "the @xmath34 template is taken from the simulation , while the @xmath35 template is extracted from a high statistics background dominated data sample composed mainly of qcd events .",
    "this sample is obtained by removing the @xmath14-tagging and @xmath30 requirements and inverting the isolation cut .",
    "these requirements reject most of the signal - like events ( single top , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and in general any process with a charged lepton from an intermediate @xmath7 boson ) .",
    "this procedure yields the following predictions for the number of qcd events passing the @xmath30 threshold in the 2d analysis : @xmath38 and in the bdt analysis : @xmath39 where `` @xmath40 '' indicates the systematic uncertainty coming from the @xmath35 model and `` @xmath41 '' indicates the maximum variation between the results when varying the fit range .",
    "the central values of these predictions are used in the analyses , while the uncertainties on these values are conservatively taken as @xmath42 in the muon decay channel in both analyses , @xmath43 in the electron decay channel in the bdt analysis and @xmath44 in the 2d analysis .",
    "the @xmath23light partons background is treated differently in both analyses . in the bdt analysis ,",
    "the @xmath23light partons yield is treated as a nuisance parameter in a fully bayesian procedure . in the 2d analysis ,",
    "partially data - driven methods are used to extract the normalization and the kinematics .",
    "the same factor is then also used for @xmath45 jets .",
    "a suitable control sample , dominated by the @xmath7 + light flavors background , is obtained with an orthogonal selection where the events are required to have one isolated lepton and exactly two jets .",
    "one of the jets is required to be `` taggable '' , i.e. , within the tracker acceptance and with at least two tracks satisfying the quality selection of the @xmath14-tagging algorithm .",
    "both jets should fail the tight @xmath14-tagging selection . to model the distributions of the variables used in this analysis in @xmath7 + light flavor background events in the signal region ,",
    "the distributions obtained in this @xmath46enriched sample in data will be used , after subtracting the other contributions ( including signal , which accounts for roughly 1% of this sample ) estimated with simulated samples .    to estimate the scale factor for the @xmath23light partons background components both this @xmath7-enriched control sample ( control sample @xmath47 ) and a subset where at least one jet passes the loose @xmath14-tagging selection ( but fails the tight one  control sample @xmath48 ) are used . in both samples",
    "a fit on the full @xmath30 distribution is performed . the qcd and @xmath23light partons components are free parameters in the fit , while all other processes , including the heavy flavour components and the @xmath0-channel signal , are constrained to the expected values .",
    "the scale factors between the number of events in the @xmath7-enriched control sample in data and simulation found are given in table  [ tab : wlight - prediction ] .",
    ".scale factors for @xmath23light partons predicted by the fits in control regions @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the 2d analysis . uncertainties",
    "are statistical only .",

    "the measurements are consistent among them and with the standard model expectation in the 4- and 5-flavour schemes .",
    "both confirm the tevatron observation of the electroweak mode of top quark production .",
    "the measurements from the 2d and bdt analyses are then combined with the best linear unbiased estimation ( blue ) method  @xcite .",
