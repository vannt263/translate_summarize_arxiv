    "is denoted by an asterix .",
    "this work has been assisted greatly by a working group on scalars , established at hadron05 .",
    "i am grateful to the large number of contributors to this working group .",
    "opinions have frequently differed , so the responsibility is mine for trying to arrive at a consensus ; at several points i need to explore conflicts of opinion and sometimes try to reach a conclusion .",
    "early evidence for the @xmath0 pole arose from elastic scattering data .",
    "markushin and locher [ 1 ] summarise many determinations .",
    "renewed interest was sparked off by e791 data on @xmath10 [ 2 ] .",
    "the @xmath6 mass projection , shown in fig . 1 , has a low mass peak which was fitted by a pole shown in the first entry of table 1 below .",
    "their fit assumed a breit - wigner resonance with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is lorentz invariant phase space @xmath13 and @xmath14 is centre of mass momentum .",
    "this choice for @xmath15 will later be shown to be inappropriate , but correcting it to a better form introduces only changes of detail .",
    "oller has refitted the data in a way consistent with chiral perturbation theory ; there is some increase in the width of the pole [ 3 ] .",
    "-4 mm    [ htb ]    higher statistics data from bes ii [ 4 ] on @xmath16 are shown in fig .",
    "they are dominated by @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath0 , which is clearly visible as a flat band along the upper right - hand edge of the dalitz plot in ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath19 contribution is shown in ( e ) .",
    "there is a marginal 2 standard deviation contribution from @xmath8 . in order to test the sensitivity of the extrapolation to the pole ,",
    "four types of parametrisation were tried .",
    "all are consistent with an average pole position @xmath20 mev .",
    "3(a ) shows the intensity of @xmath6 elastic scattering v. mass .",
    "why is there no low mass peak like that in production data of fig .",
    "2 ? the explanation was given in 1965 - 6 by adler and weinberg [ 5 ] .",
    "they proposed that massless @xmath21 of zero momentum have zero elastic amplitude . if the @xmath22 s - wave @xmath23 amplitude is expanded as a power series @xmath24 , consistency between @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels requires @xmath28 and a zero at the adler point @xmath29 .",
    "3(b ) shows the result of dividing fig .",
    "3(a ) by @xmath30 . instantly one sees a resemblance with the @xmath0 peak of fig .",
    "so the solution to the puzzle is that the matrix element for @xmath6 elastic scattering is strongly @xmath25-dependent : a situation unlike most other resonances .",
    "-17 mm    [ htb ]    -8 mm    let us write the elastic @xmath0 amplitude as @xmath31 here @xmath32 is real for @xmath33 .",
    "the phase variation comes purely from @xmath34 ; this denominator is universal for all processes involving a @xmath35 pair .",
    "[ that is the assumption on which the particle data tables are based ] . for elastic scattering ,",
    "the adler zero in @xmath36 nearly cancels the @xmath0 pole for low masses .",
    "however , the numerator @xmath36 is not universal ; it is quite different for production processes , where the left - hand cut is distant .",
    "later , it will be shown that e791 data for @xmath37 require @xmath38 within errors .",
    "the production amplitude will therefore be written @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a complex coupling constant .",
    "[ htb ]    -4 mm    fig .",
    "4 sketches contours of constant intensity for ( a ) production , ( b ) elastic scattering . in the latter case ,",
    "the effect of the adler zero is to suppress the intensity near @xmath41 .",
    "the elastic phase shift on the real @xmath25 axis ( where experiments are done ) reaches @xmath42 only at @xmath43 mev , far above the position of the pole .",
    "it is this feature which confuses many people .",
    "however , the phase varies rapidly off the real axis because the width increases with @xmath25 and because of consequent effects of analyticity .",
    "a simultaneous fit is made to bes ii data , @xmath44 [ 6 ] and cern - munich data [ 7 ] using the empirical form : @xmath45(1 + \\beta s ) \\rho _ { \\pi \\pi}(s ) + m\\gamma _ { 4\\pi } ( s).\\ ] ] the exponential is required by @xmath6 elastic data to cut off @xmath36 above 1 gev . the term @xmath46 accounts for @xmath47 inelasticity above @xmath48 gev , but has little effect on the @xmath49 pole . note from fig .",
    "2(e ) that the @xmath0 intensity fitted to bes data falls to a low value above 1 gev .",
    "the @xmath0 pole is therefore distinct from the broad @xmath50 fitted by anisovich et al . [",
    "it is also distinct from the broad pole fitted around 1 gev by au , morgan and pennington [ 9 ] .    below the @xmath51 threshold",
    ", the elastic amplitude must follow the unitarity circle .",
    "there are small contributions from the low mass tails of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , etc . and a contribution from @xmath8 which is large around 1 gev .",
    "these are included by writing @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath55-matrix @xmath56 for each individual resonance . below the @xmath51 threshold , @xmath57 for all amplitudes , so phases due to individual resonances",
    "for production , there are hundreds of open channels for @xmath58 and @xmath59 decays . within individual channels",
    ", unitarity plays a negligible role . in the standard isobar model , _ amplitudes _",
    "are added using a complex coupling constant @xmath60 for each amplitude ; the phase @xmath61 is constant over the whole dalitz plot . for @xmath62 , @xmath61 is the phase of @xmath63 elastic scattering at the @xmath59 mass ; it is unknown , so @xmath64 and @xmath61 need to be fitted to the data .",
    "the @xmath44 data are available up to 380 mev and there is then a gap in elastic scattering data until 560 mev , where cern - munich data begin .",
    "the @xmath0 pole lies in the mass range where there are no elastic data .",
    "although this gap may be bridged by using dispersion relations , the production data are obviously important in filling the gap directly .",
    "in the bes data , the @xmath65 channel contributes 41% intensity and @xmath66 19% .",
    "there are strong interferences between them which determine the phase variation of the @xmath0 with mass .",
    "the data have been divided into bins 100 mev wide from 400 to 1000 mev .",
    "5 shows phases for individual bins , keeping magnitudes fixed at values from the global fit : this achieves optimum accuracy , since there is noise in the magnitude in individual bins if it is set free .",
    "the full curve shows the phase from elastic scattering data .",
    "the agreement with the bin - by - bin fit shows that the breit - wigner form of eqn .",
    "( 1 ) indeed accounts for the phase in all data .",
    "the implication is that the data at low mass may be described by a single resonance , except for well understood contributions from @xmath8 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is _ not _ necessary to include a background amplitude .",
    "another way of stating this is that if any background is present , it is the same in both elastic scattering and production and may be absorbed algebraically into the parametrisation of the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "[ htb ]    -4 mm    within the scalar working group , it has been suggested that phases could be modified by rescattering of pions from @xmath0 decay off the @xmath67 ; although this must happen at some level , its contribution seems to be below the level of experimental errors at present .    the dotted curve of fig .",
    "5 shows the phase variation if the amplitude for the @xmath0 is expressed in the form @xmath68 .",
    "this gives a marginally poorer fit , but can not be distinguished cleanly using the bes data .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath69 band runs off the corner of the dalitz plot and does not interfere significantly with the @xmath0 below 400 mev .",
    "[ t ]    .summary of pole positions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "it is important to realise that there is a large background of theoretical work on elastic scattering and related processes like @xmath70 .",
    "colangelo , gasser and leutwyler [ 10 ] have made a precise determination of the @xmath0 pole from elastic scattering and @xmath44 data without using production data .",
    "they use crossing symmetry to calculate the amplitude on the left - hand cut @xmath71 from amplitudes at @xmath72 ( right - hand cut ) . for a given @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the two are related by a simple isospin matrix ; the @xmath6 s - wave amplitudes is then evaluated from an integration over the appropriate range of @xmath26 ( and likewise for p and d - waves , including appropriate legendre polynomials ) . as a further constraint",
    ", they use fixed @xmath26 dispersion relations ( roy equations ) .",
    "this extends greatly the range of @xmath25 in which the s - wave is known and fixes the @xmath73 and 2 scattering lengths accurately . in this work , @xmath74 is accurately determined and contains a very clear adler zero at @xmath75 ( displaced by a tiny amount from weinberg s prediction because of higher powers of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the published work fits @xmath6 masses up to 800 mev and demands a @xmath0 pole at @xmath76 mev , i.e. about 2 standard deviations from the bes experimental value .",
    "further work is in progress , to extend the fitted mass range to 1150 mev , above @xmath8 and the @xmath51 threshold .    in a series of papers",
    "[ 11 - 16 ] , oset , oller , pelaez and collaborators have fitted data using ` unitarised ' chiral perturbation theory . in outline",
    ", they use chpt for lowest order and take rescattering from the next order .",
    "they successfully fit not only the @xmath22 s - wave , but also reproduce the repulsive @xmath77 s - wave .",
    "their pole positions are given in table 1 .",
    "schechter s group has also contributed a series of papers on all of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 [ 1721 ] .",
    "this work examines possible mixing between 2-quark and 4-quark states .",
    "zheng and collaborators at peking university have developed new types of dispersion relations and have applied them to analysis of data on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 [ 2225 ] . in particular , they clarify how unphysical sub - threshold poles can originate from the @xmath78 dependence of phase space factors ; they also show that a pole is possible without the phase shift reaching @xmath42 , as may well happen in @xmath7 scattering .",
    "thirdly , in ref . 25 , they repeat the analysis of colangelo et al . with different dispersion relations fitting the left - hand cut ; they confirm the necessity for the @xmath0 pole .",
    "focus data on @xmath80 exhibit a similar low mass peak to e791 data [ 26 ] . if it is fitted with a breit - wigner with @xmath81 ,",
    "there is a pole at @xmath82 mev [ 27 ] .",
    "however , focus show that their data can also be fitted with a k - matrix parametrisation of anisovich and sarantsev [ 28 ] which does not include a @xmath0 pole .",
    "this provides an escape route for those who do not wish to believe in the @xmath0 pole .",
    "the babar collaboration has likewise found that their data can be fitted by the same k - matrix parametrisation [ 29 ] .",
    "this point requires some detailed and ( unfortunately ) critical comments .",
    "there are several problems .",
    "the k - matrix parametrisation includes low mass poles at @xmath83 and 1200 mev and at @xmath84 gev@xmath85 .",
    "focus report their parametrisation fully , so it is straightforward to follow details of the fit .",
    "the first point is that the low mass region is being fitted by 3 poles instead of 1 .",
    "this introduces large flexibility into the fit .",
    "the second point is that the pole below threshold plays a major role , but is questionable .",
    "if it is a zero of @xmath34 , it is a very deeply bound state which is more questionable than the @xmath0 .",
    "a more likely interpretation is a pole of @xmath36 .",
    "however , the @xmath86 function is different for @xmath6 elastic scattering and production reactions .",
    "so there is no reason to think that a pole fitted to elastic scattering will be appropriate to production .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath86 function is normally interpreted as providing driving forces which generate the amplitudes on the right - hand cut , e.g. resonances .",
    "including them as specific poles in searching for resonances looks like double - counting .",
    "there is a third problem . in the k - matrix approach ,",
    "@xmath6 elastic scattering below the @xmath51 threshold is fitted not only by @xmath87 ( i.e. @xmath88 but also by the analytic continuation of @xmath89 below the @xmath51 threshold .",
    "in the case of @xmath58 decays , this corresponds to @xmath90 , followed by @xmath51 rescattering to @xmath35 .",
    "this component should be constrained to reproduce data on @xmath91 above threshold ; however , that has not been done .    in k - matrix fits to @xmath6 elastic scattering below the @xmath51 threshold , i know from personal experience that there is large cross - talk between @xmath87 and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath89 increases below threshold as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the magnitude of the virtual momentum in the @xmath51 channel .",
    "the increasing @xmath89 as @xmath94 looks not unlike a @xmath0 pole .",
    "the extrapolation below @xmath51 threshold is reliable only close to threshold . in the flatt ' e formula for @xmath8 , as an example , it plays an important role in contributing to the real part of the amplitude near resonance .",
    "however , far from threshold the extrapolation is hazardous .",
    "this is a general problem which has been seen elsewhere .",
    "for example , in calculations of charmonium levels , open charm states with large decay widths perturb energy levels by major amounts .",
    "my view is that there is a stabilising factor which needs to be brought into play .",
    "it is common experience that form factors play a role above threshold with a radius of order 0.60.8 fm . if such a form factor is needed above threshold , the analytic continuation below threshold breaks down because it depends critically on the imaginary part of the amplitude extending to infinity . with a form factor",
    ", the continuation below threshold can instead be done using a dispersion integral : @xmath95 i have carried out calculations along these lines .",
    "the form factor gives @xmath96 a localised peak close to threshold and the result is that @xmath97 drops fairly rapidly below threshold . in practice",
    ", it falls below threshold with a form similar to the fall - off above threshold , e.g. @xmath98 .",
    "this behaviour is totally different from the analytic continuation without a form factor , and can easily lead to an order of magnitude reduction in @xmath97 by the time one reaches the position of the @xmath0 pole .",
    "focus show in their figs .",
    "7 and 8 , the magnitudes they fit to sub - threshold @xmath51 , @xmath47 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 amplitudes ; all are very large compared with fitted values of these amplitudes above threshold , typically by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "it seems physically unreasonable that channels like @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which are quite small in the physical region , should make large sub - threshold contributions .",
    "putting this point in a different way , why stop at the @xmath47 channel above threshold ?",
    "why not include an infinity of open channels at high mass : @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 this leads to the possibility of fitting _ all _ mesons resonances as interferences between an infinity of distant high - mass singularities .",
    "this contradicts the conventional view that low mass peaks may be attributed to nearby singularities unless there is a specific convincing alternative .",
    "my impression is that the k - matrix is dependable above threshold , where it is fitted directly to data on the inelastic channels . but below threshold , it introduces excessive flexibility .",
    "what is urgently needed is to constrain it to fit the left - hand cut as well , following the work of colangelo et al .",
    "conversely , a criticism of published fits based on the t - matrix is that they ignore sub - threshold contributions from @xmath47 , @xmath51 and @xmath99 . a more rigorous expression for the breit - wigner denominator of eqn . ( 1 ) is @xmath104 in work not yet published , i have used this full form .",
    "it takes account of the opening of the inelastic channels and also the effect of the dispersive contribution in eqn .",
    "( 3 ) to @xmath105 .",
    "the detailed parameters of the fit change , but effects on the position of the @xmath0 pole are within the presently quoted errors .",
    "the essential reason for this is that the bes data define the position and width of the peak unambiguously .",
    "what happens is that the additional term @xmath106 in the denominator is accomodated by corresponding changes in the already flexible form of @xmath36 .",
    "e791 data on @xmath107 provided the first evidence for the @xmath1 pole from production data [ 30 ] .",
    "their parametrisation gives a pole at @xmath108 mev .",
    "a combined fit to these and other data will be shown below .",
    "next , bes ii data on @xmath109 provide further evidence for the @xmath1 in the channel @xmath110 [ 31,32 ] .",

    "( 1 ) is used with @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "[ fits of similar quality may be obtained by replacing @xmath122 with @xmath123 or @xmath124 with marginally poorer log likelihood ] . if the factor @xmath125 is omitted from eqn .",

    "the @xmath1 mass projection is shown by the full histogram of fig .",
    "8(b ) and the @xmath126 mass projection as the dashed histogram .",
    "there is destructive interference between @xmath1 and @xmath126 ; their coherent sum is shown by the dashed histogram in fig .",
    "sensitivity to this interference is one reason for fitting the lass data simultaneously ; it is absent in those data , where the phases of the two components add .",
    "a second reason is to examine whether eqn .",
    "( 8) fits both sets of data successfully .",
    "since @xmath127 decays populate the low mass @xmath7 range , it is essential to demonstrate that @xmath127 decays do not reproduce the @xmath1 peak . omitting the @xmath1 leads to a fit worse by @xmath128 in log likelihood .",
    "an essential feature of the analysis is the separation of the 1430 mev @xmath7 peak between @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "this separation can be made cleanly only by analysing angular correlations between @xmath131 and the accompanying @xmath132 ( entanglement ) .",

    "the @xmath126 is fitted with a flatt ' e formula including coupling to @xmath136 ; it requires @xmath137 .",
    "a detail is that the adler zero is also included into the width of the @xmath126 so that there is an adler zero in the full @xmath7 s - wave ; this zero improves the fit noticeably .",
    "the phase variation of the @xmath1 with mass is well determined in two ways which agree .",
    "firstly , there is a large interference between channels @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "secondly , there is a large interference between @xmath1 and @xmath126 , which both contribute to the @xmath7 s - wave .",
    "a bin - by - bin fit has been made where the @xmath1 signal is fitted in magnitude and phase in 10 individual bins 100 mev wide .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "9 and are in good agreement with the global fit ( full curves ) .",
    "[ the data points have been adjusted for the phase @xmath61 of the isobar model , so that the @xmath1 phase is zero at threshold ] .",
    "the agreement between the bin - by - bin fit and the full curve shows that the phase variation can be fitted by the same @xmath34 in both cases , i.e. purely by a resonance .",
    "-13 mm    [ htb ]    -7 mm    there is a point of general interest concerning the @xmath1 phase .",
    "if there is a pole near threshold , why does the observed phase not go through @xmath42 at low mass ?",
    "this is a subtle point .",
    "the clue is that the @xmath1 pole lies in the complex @xmath25-plane almost below the @xmath51 threshold .",
    "the factor @xmath125 in eqn .",
    "( 8) develops an imaginary part as one goes off the real @xmath25-axis .",
    "also the phase space factor @xmath12 becomes complex .",
    "the combined effect of these two effects is to produce a phase rotation of nearly @xmath42 as one moves off the real @xmath25-axis to the pole . at the pole",
    ", the phase does indeed go through @xmath42 .",
    "but on the real @xmath25-axis , the constraint of unitarity holds the phase at zero at the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "there is a retardation of the @xmath1 phase along the real @xmath25- axis of roughly @xmath42 with respect to the pole , although there is also some @xmath25-dependence .",
    "this was pointed out by oller [ 3 ] ; a corresponding smaller effect occures likewise for the @xmath0 pole . on the real @xmath25-axis ,",
    "one is really seeing the upper side of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 poles but with retarded phases caused by the curious effects of analyticity near threshold .",
    "this is an unfamiliar situation and has caused widespread confusion .",
    "a criticism has been made that @xmath1 and @xmath126 can not be separated in the @xmath7 s - wave .",
    "if so , phases could be adjusted freely in the bin - by - bin fit , but the fit resists that .",
    "secondly , the criticism is logically incorrect .",
    "the argument is that magnitudes and phases of both @xmath1 and @xmath126 can be fitted freely as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "if that were true , it would always be impossible to separate any two resonances with the same @xmath141 in a single channel .",
    "however , analyticity requires that real and imaginary parts of the amplitude are related and can not be fitted independently . in the conventional approach , each resonance is fitted by a breit - wigner amplitude where magnitude and phase are parametrised by a single function of @xmath25 .",
    "there is indeed flexibility in @xmath36 for the @xmath1 , but only limited flexibility ; to a first approximation , the real part of the amplitude is close to the gradient of the imaginary part , as in the simple breit - wigner formula .",
    "the upshot is that the observed intensity in the @xmath7 s - wave as a function of @xmath25 is determined by the intensities of the individual @xmath1 and @xmath126 and the real part of the interference between them .",
    "these three terms have distinctively different @xmath25-dependence and can not be confused , except within statistics of each component .",
    "furthermore , interferences of both @xmath1 and @xmath126 with @xmath140 provide an independent determination of phases .",
    "the agreement with the phase in lass data also seems hardly fortuitous .",
    "an independent analysis of exactly the same data has been reported by the bes group [ 31 ] .",
    "i do not have the figures , so it is necessary to refer to ref .",
    "this analysis parametrises the @xmath1 in the same general form as the ishida model [ 34 ] .",
    "the @xmath7 s - wave amplitude is fitted as the sum of a conventional breit - wigner amplitude with @xmath142 plus an incoherent background which is adjusted to fit the remaining intensity as a function of mass .",

    "one of the phase determinations comes from interference between @xmath1 and @xmath126 . ref . [ 31 ] states that the bes analysis omits this interference . secondly , because of the interference between @xmath126 and @xmath1 , it is important to separate the channels @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this separation requires analysis of the full angular correlations between decays of @xmath111 and @xmath132 .",

    "the coupling of @xmath8 to @xmath51 corresponds to a width of 695 mev when @xmath173 .",
    "the resonance appears as a narrow cusp at the @xmath51 threshold because the @xmath51 channel opens extremely rapidly ; the increase in the total width pulls the intensity in the @xmath6 channel down sharply at threshold , making the resonance appear narrow .    there is another interesting way of viewing this effect . the amplitude for @xmath174 is given by @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are centre of mass momenta .",

    "the saga begins in the early 1960 s . at this time , it was a puzzle why the lightest mesons were the @xmath21 and the @xmath182 , whereas ground - states of even - even nuclei were @xmath19",
    ". this led schwinger to postulate the existence of a @xmath0 meson .",
    "a second puzzle was the goldberger - treiman relation and the fact that the axial weak current is nearly conserved , like the vector current . in an effort to save the goldberger - treiman relation from renormalisation effects , gell - mann and levy invented chiral symmetry [ 40 ] and the linear @xmath0 model , placing the pion and the @xmath0 on an equal basis .",
    "nambu and jona - lasinio invented the non - linear @xmath0 model [ 41 ] .",
    "today it is still an open question whether these models have any connection with the observed @xmath0 pole .    when qcd emerged , it was clear that chiral symmetry is broken by the appearance of mass terms of the form @xmath183 in the lagrangian .",
    "today it is almost universally accepted that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "spontaneous breaking of a symmetry leads to the existence of a massless goldstone boson .",
    "many examples are known in condensed matter physics .",
    "a classic example is ferromagnetism where , below a critical point , spins align spontaneously ; there is an associated massless magnon responsible for spin - waves . in a crystal ,",
    "the regular spacing of atoms spontaneously creates order ; the phonon is the associated massless particle .",
    "it is widely believed that the pion is almost massless because of chiral symmetry breaking ; this leads to the adler zero , which has played a prominent role in fitting the data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the small mass of the pion derives from the small masses of @xmath27 and @xmath184 quarks .",
    "gell - mann , oakes and renner showed [ 42 ] that @xmath185 here , @xmath186 is the pion decay constant .",
    "it is intriguing that the mass of the pion is related to the density of @xmath19 fluctuations .",
    "it is not presently clear whether these fluctuations have any relation to @xmath0 , etc .",
    "a confined quark will surround itself with a cloud of gluons and sea - quarks .",
    "two sets of authors [ 43,44 ] suggest that the resulting constituent quarks will acquire a mass of roughly one - third the mass of the nucleon .",
    "a @xmath0 made of two such constituent quarks would have roughly the right mass .",
    "however a problem with this scheme is that one would then expect the @xmath0 to have a brother with @xmath187 at a very similar mass , whereas the @xmath9 is @xmath188 mev heavier .",
    "this problem led jaffe to propose that @xmath0 and its relatives are @xmath189 states [ 45 ] .",
    "his suggestion is that there is a pairing interaction forming diquarks in the flavour 3 configuration : @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",

    "an interesting experimental question is whether there is a further @xmath202 state .",
    "this is foreign to jaffe s scheme .",
    "gams have reported tentative evidence for a narrow state in @xmath100 at 1914 mev , almost exactly the @xmath203 threshold [ 47 ] .",
    "such a state would decay easily to @xmath100 and would be more prominent there than in @xmath204 , just as @xmath8 is more prominent in @xmath163 than in @xmath205 : more phase space .",
    "there is support for jaffe s scheme from recent lattice qcd calculations of okiharu et al .",
    "they find configurations of fig .",

    "14(b ) at small @xmath206 .",
    "lattice qcd calculations favour the multi - y - shaped flux - tube configuration for the connected 4-quark system .",
    "one can rationalise this scenario with the argument that quarks at large @xmath206 are non - perturbative and acquire mass from dressing .",
    "another view of this is that it costs energy to establish a flux tube between quarks separated radially .",
    "the massive @xmath189 configuration can decay by fission to two lighter pions at small @xmath206 .",
    "there is experimental support for the notion that decays to @xmath35 are at short range .",
    "the @xmath0 amplitude is known v. momentum @xmath14 up to nearly 2 gev / c .",

    "[ there will also be some @xmath219 decay at small @xmath206 ] .",
    "when such decays occur , the passive kaonic cloud at large @xmath206 is left ` in the air ' ( adiabatic approximation ) , and contributes to ` fall - apart ' decays .",
    "the intensity of these fall - apart decays is proportional to the @xmath51 intensity in the wave function , and reduces the discrepancy with jaffe s model by a factor 2 .",
    "however , this argument does not account for @xmath8 lying closer to the @xmath51 threshold than @xmath9 ; that must be taken from experiment .",
    "there is another important distinction between @xmath0 ( and its family ) and the accepted @xmath213 states . in @xmath6 elastic scattering , @xmath221 and @xmath222 exchanges in @xmath27 and @xmath26",
    "channels generate attraction .",
    "if one takes the @xmath182-matrix in the @xmath25-channel from these born terms , the unitarised amplitude @xmath223 reproduces the observed @xmath6 s - wave quite well up to 1 gev and beyond [ 50,51 ] .",
    "similar exchanges are roughly sufficient to generate @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in this respect , @xmath0 and its relatives",
    "behave completely differently to regular @xmath213 states like @xmath221 , @xmath67 , @xmath111 and @xmath224 .",
    "these can not be derived from @xmath26 and @xmath27-channel exchanges .",
    "it was this fact which led to the quark model .",
    "the commonly accepted @xmath213 resonances appear as cdd poles [ 52 ] ; these are poles which identically satisfy dispersion relations with no apparent connection with driving terms in @xmath36 on the left - hand cut .",
    "for this reason , some people view @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 as molecular states made of mesons .",
    "there is , however , an alternative view . in nucleon - nucleon physics",
    ", the observed partial waves can be explained in terms of meson exchanges .",
    "it is conventional to view these exchanges as generating a potential @xmath225 . in meson physics , it is equally possible to take the view that @xmath35 elastic scattering is telling us about the confining potential itself .",
    "regular @xmath213 states are confined within this potential ; their leakage out of the potential dictates their decay widths .",
    "these widths _ must _ come out so that they satisfy analyticity over left and right - hand cuts .",
    "any connection of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 poles to this potential is presently speculative .",
    "the formation of nuclei is clearly a phase transition .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is also clearly a phase transition ; lattice qcd calculations tell us that the phase boundary is at about 160 mev",
    ". an important question if whether confinement is the same phase transition as chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "present indications from lattice qcd calculations are that it has a similar transition temperature .",
    "another interesting , related scheme is that of van beveren and rupp [ 53 - 55 ] .",
    "they set out to model the spectrum of all mesons from the lightest to charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "this is done with either a harmonic oscillator potential [ 53 ] , which can be handled algebraically , or any kind of confinement spectrum in a more general approach [ 54,55 ] . to allow for decays",
    ", they couple @xmath213 states to outgoing mesons through a transition potential .",
    "ideally , this transition potential has a @xmath226 dependence on radius @xmath206 [ 53 ] , but in most calculations it is approximated by a @xmath227 function at @xmath206 = 0.60.7 fm or smaller ( for heavy q - qbar systems ) .",
    "their equations include a relativistic reduced mass for the two outgoing mesons .",
    "this reduced mass generates a zero in the amplitude very similar to the adler zero .      in this scheme , @xmath52 , @xmath228 , @xmath126 , etc .",
    "are regular though unitarised @xmath213 states ; @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 appear as ` extra ' states created by coupling of @xmath213 to mesonic decays .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 were indeed predicted rather well in 1986 [ 53 ] .",
    "it is instructive to vary the coupling constant @xmath229 between confined states and mesons .",
    "for very weak coupling , @xmath0 and @xmath1 appear as continuum states with infinitely large widths , i.e.  at very large @xmath230 .",
    "16 shows the analogous @xmath231 situation . as the coupling between confined @xmath213 states and outgoing mesons",
    "is increased , the continuum state moves towards the real axis ; simultaneously , the @xmath232 state acquires a width and moves off the real @xmath25 axis . in this way , they account for the @xmath231 like @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. as an extra , `` molecular '' state , created by coupling of the @xmath233 continuum to regular @xmath232 @xmath19 state ; the latter are pushed to a higher mass than that of the usual funnel potential [ 55 ] .",
    "theorists have tried varying the numbers of colours using unitarised chiral perturbation theory [ 56,57 ] .",
    "they find that as @xmath235 increases , @xmath0 and @xmath1 fade away into the continuum .",
    "[ 58 ] agrees that they change by large amounts , but reaches different conclusions about the precise change ] .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath221 which survives largely unchanged as @xmath236 increases .",
    "that is further evidence that the light scalars have a different character to conventional @xmath213 states .",
