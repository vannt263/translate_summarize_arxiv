    "the uncertainty principle is one of the most popular and important concepts in quantum theory and lies at the heart of it @xcite .",
    "this principle sets limits on the precise prediction of the outcomes of two incompatible quantum measurements on a particle .",
    "for example , the position and momentum of a particle can not be simultaneously measured with arbitrary high precision in quantum theory .",
    "the uncertainty principle can be expressed in different forms .",
    "robertson @xcite and schrodinger @xcite have shown that for arbitrary pairs of noncommuting observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the uncertainty principle has the following form @xmath2 \\rangle \\vert,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 indicates the standard deviation of the associated observable @xmath4 @xmath5 an alternative approach to determine the uncertainty relation for any two general observables is based on the entropic measures @xcite .",
    "the first version of entropic uncertainty relation was given by kraus @xcite and then proved by maassen and uffink @xcite , it has the following form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the shannon entropy of the measured observable @xmath8 before the outcome of its measurement is revealed , here @xmath9 is the probability of the outcome @xmath10 , @xmath11 quantifies the ` complementarity ' between the observables @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the eigenvectors of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . for mixed states , this bound was improved and tightened @xcite as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the von neumann entropy of @xmath17 , with @xmath17 is the density matrix of the measured particle .",

    "@xcite consider a situation in which an extra quantum system serving as a quantum memory @xmath18 , has correlation with the measured quantum system @xmath19 .",
    "they proved that the uncertainty of bob , who has access to the quantum memory , about the result of measurements @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the alice s system , a , is bounded by @xmath20 where , @xmath21 is the conditional von neumann entropy , @xmath22 with @xmath23 denotes the conditional von neumann entropies of the post measurement states after measurement on first subsystem in @xmath24 basis    @xmath25 where @xmath26 s are the eigenstates of the observable @xmath24 , and @xmath27 is the identity operator .",
    "the quantum memory - assisted uncertainty relation in eq.[berta1 ] has important and various applications such as witnessing entanglement and cryptographic security @xcite .",

    "for a tripartite scenario in which a quantum state , @xmath35 , has been shared between alice(a ) , bob(b ) and charlie(c ) , due to the monogamy of entanglement , @xmath19 can not maximally entangled with both @xmath18 and @xmath36 , thus bob and charlie can not predict the outcomes of alice s measurements exactly @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we consider a situation in which bob and charlie can do local operation and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "bob and charlie concentrate their correlation with alice in one side , for example in charlie s side .",

    "consider a tripartite scenario in which , an arbitrary quantum state @xmath35 has been shared between alice , bob , and charlie .",
    "they have agreed on two measurements , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "alice measures either @xmath0 or @xmath1 on @xmath19 and informs bob and charlie of her measurement choice but not the outcomes .",
    "bob and charlie want to predict the outcomes of the measurements .",
    "if communication between them is forbidden then the uncertainties of bob and charlie about alice s measurements outcomes are @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . from the strong subadditivity ,",
    "@xmath41 one can see that    @xmath42    so , it is impossible for @xmath34 and @xmath43 to take negative values , simultaneously .",
    "thus , both bob and charlie can not predict the outcomes of alice s measurements with uncertainty less than @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath35 is pure state , @xmath44 , there is a tradeoff relation between their ability to predict the alice s measurement outcomes . in other word ,",
    "the more precisely the alice s measurement outcomes is predicted by bob , the less precisely it will be predicted by charlie and vice versa@xcite .",
    "this is a confirmation of the monogamy of entanglement , which simply says that the more bob is entangled with alice , the less he is with charlie .",
    "particulary , when the particle @xmath19 is entangled with both @xmath18 and @xmath36 , neither bob nor charlie can exactly predict the alice s measurement outcomes .    in the above scenario , communication between bob and charlie",

    ", charlie uses an ancillary quantum register @xmath1 , general state is as @xmath45 , now bob and charlie perform an locc protocol to maximizes the mutual information between alice and charlie .",

    "the classical correlation is given by @xmath91(provided that the ( povm ) measurement @xmath92 is performed on the first part ) , here @xmath93 is postmeasurement state with probability for obtaining the outcome @xmath94 as @xmath95 .",
