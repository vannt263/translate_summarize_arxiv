    "several experiments to search for rare process like @xmath8-decay and its variety in the form of @xmath9-capture are carried out at the baksan neutrino observatory , inr ras @xcite .",
    "such processes are difficult to detect as there is only low energy characteristic photon that is available for registration ( total energy release @xmath10 kev ) .",
    "the following nuclei are considered as most promising to search for this process : @xmath11kr@xmath12se , @xmath13ru@xmath14mo , @xmath15cd@xmath16pd , @xmath1xe@xmath17te , @xmath18ba@xmath19xe , @xmath20ce@xmath21ba .",
    "two of these isotopes are gases ( @xmath11kr , @xmath1xe ) , and their kinetic energy of transition , q , is the largest in this list .",
    "it is easy to develop and construct the detection system , a source - detector , on the basis of these gases .",
    "a large proportional counter ( lpc ) of high pressure with a casing of m1-grade copper has been used to register the process of @xmath4-capture in @xmath1xe .",
    "the details of the counter construction and the technique of the experiment are described in @xcite . at the first stage of the experiment the sample of 12 l",
    "( sample no .  1 ) of xe enriched in @xmath1xe up to 63.3% ( 44 g ) has been used @xcite . at the second stage of experiment",

    "3 was unknown it was decided to carry out several measurements to make the test of the cross sections of different channels of its creation .",
    "in our work we consider two channels of @xmath0xe production .",
    "the choice of these channels was determined by the isotopic composition of sample no .  3 .",

    "two independent measurements to test the production of @xmath0xe channels were carried out . in these measurements the xenon of 18 l ( sample no .",

    "2 ) preparation to search for @xmath4-capture of @xmath1xe .",
    "as mentioned above , the lpc counter was used to investigate the process of @xmath0xe production , and @xmath25cd source was used for its calibration .",
    "the source has two gamma lines , 22 kev and 88 kev , but as the wall of lpc is quite thick ( 6.5 mm ) and absorbs 22 kev gammas , only 88 kev line was used for calibration .",
    "the calibration spectrum is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "spectrum of @xmath25cd source used in calibration of lpc.,width=3 ]    the background measurements of xe ( @xmath26xe ) of natural composition were carried out before the sample no .  4 measurements .",
    "this sample of @xmath26xe has been kept in underground conditions and thus had not been exposed to cosmic rays for about twenty years .",

    "4 has been kept in a special box with antineutron shield ( 1 mm cadmium and 20 cm polyethylene ) in a room of `` carpet 2 '' installation @xcite to expose the sample to cosmic ray s muons .",
    "the main reason of the antineutron shield was to prevent the production of @xmath0xe isotope by neutrons through @xmath2xe@xmath28xe channel .",

    ", width=3 ]    the events from @xmath0xe decay were searched in the energy interval of @xmath29 .",
    "the number of @xmath0xe events in the region of interest was determined by the difference between spectra of sample no .  4 and the background sample of @xmath26xe . but",
    "the value obtained gives only the registered events .",
    "to find out the total number of @xmath0xe atoms that was at the beginning of measurements several renormalizations were done .",
    "the first normalization was on the branching factor .",
    "@xmath0xe isotope decays to form @xmath0i via capturing an electron from @xmath24-shell , while @xmath0i nucleus stays in an excited state .",
    "therefore , full energy - release consists in contribution of characteristic photons and an auge - electron appears during iodine @xmath24-shell filling ; contribution of gamma rays and conversion electron appear after deexcitation of iodine nucleus .",
    "gamma rays have energy within @xmath30 kev range .",
    "the probability of gamma rays occurrence increases with energy and that of the conversion electrons decreases .",
    "the efficiency of registration of gamma rays of high energy is very low . as a result",
    ", the main contribution to the region of interest is made by energy released in filling @xmath24-shall . the fluorescence yield upon filling a single vacancy of the @xmath24 shell in iodine is 0.89% @xcite .",
    "but in any case we need to take into account all decay channels in order to determine the amount of atoms at the beginning of measurements .",
    "the second normalization is on the detection efficiency .",
    "this normalization allows one to evaluate the detection efficiency of the events with the energy sought for in this study and make recalculations for the full amount of events that occurred in the detector .",
    "the detection efficiency for iodine characteristic photons is 0.26 . using the obtained value of the lpc events and the law of radioactive decay we can get the equilibrium number of @xmath0xe atoms at the beginning of measurements .",
    "the muon flux at the ground level where `` carpet2 '' installation is located is @xmath31  @xmath32h@xmath33 @xcite . applying equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for the radioactive isotope recovery @xcite we can calculate the cross - section of @xmath0xe isotope production from @xmath3xe by cosmic ray s muons : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of @xmath0xe atoms that are in equilibrium at the beginning of measurements ; @xmath36  @xmath32h@xmath33 is the muon flux ; @xmath37 h is the exposure time of xe sample ; @xmath38 mole is the amount of matter of @xmath3xe ; @xmath39 mol@xmath33 is the avogadro s number .",
    "putting the existing values into formula ( [ eq1 ] ) , we get : @xmath40    this rather conservative value is explained by the fact that the behavior of the xe sample no .  4 and the xe sample of natural composition in the region of interest is the same and the excess over background is minimal .      for testing this channel of @xmath0xe production",
    "the bottle with the xe sample under study has been placed in a separate room of the main building of bno inr ras .",
    "this room is located on the top floor of the building , where the flux of thermal neutrons produced by cosmic rays in the concrete blocks is maximal .",
    "the exposure time was 1272 hours .",
    "the neutron flux was measured by a special detector and was found to be @xmath41  @xmath32h@xmath33 @xcite . after the exposure the gas was taken to the underground low - background laboratory and used to fill lpc .",
