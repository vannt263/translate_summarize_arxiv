    "synchronization is one of the most commonly occurring phenomenon in various physical and biological networks and it has been a topic of active research in recent years  @xcite . for instance , synchronization is one of the most crucial dynamical aspects in social networks , neuronal networks , cardiac pacemakers , circadian rhythms , ecological systems , power grids , etc @xcite .",
    "the emergence of collective oscillations in these kinds of coupled systems can be described by the kuramoto model , which is a mathematically tractable model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "when the oscillators are uncoupled they oscillate at their own frequencies .",
    "when the oscillators are coupled by the sine of their phase differences , the frequencies of the oscillators are modified leading to synchronization depending upon the coupling strength .",
    "most of the previous studies in this area @xcite have been devoted to the case where the coupling strength between the different oscillators in the network is fixed . however , considering the self - organizational nature of most complex systems ( like that of social systems and neuronal networks ) , inclusion of an adaptive coupling among the oscillators appears to be more realistic @xcite .",
    "the emergence of synchronization in complex networks , for example social networks involving opinion formation or brain , is due to the fact that coupling between different entities in the network varies dynamically @xcite .",
    "the coupling usually varies due to the interplay between the dynamical states and the network topology @xcite .",
    "such networks are called adaptive networks .",
    "the presence of adaptive coupling is one of the most crucial factors that control the dynamics and streamline various processess in complex networks .",
    "for instance in the brain , where synchronization is not always desirable , the presence of adaptive coupling can lead to desynchronization by the alteration of coupling naturally when the system senses the occurrence of such undesirable synchronization @xcite .",
    "very recently aoki and aoyagi have found that systems with adaptive coupling give rise to three basic synchronization states due to the self - organizational nature of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "they have discovered the existence of a two - cluster state , a coherent state ( in which the oscillators are having a fixed phase relationship with each other ) , and a chaotic state in which the coupling weights and the relative phases between the oscillators are chaotically shuffled .",
    "this implies that the existence of adaptive coupling accounts for the feature rich , yet self - organized behaviour of real - world complex networks .    what is more interesting in the context of social and biological networks is their ability to adapt themselves and learn from their own dynamics , given that there is no one to administrate their activity and control them @xcite .",
    "for example , opinion formation in social networks is a complex phenomenon which not only depends on the number of conformists and contrarians @xcite but also on how the opinion evolves in time .",
    "this opinion evolution is essentially the cause of self - organization which gives rise to social clusters / groups and also synchronization in the network @xcite .",
    "this kind of adaptive evolution of opinion not only plays a crucial role in the social network but is also found to influence the dynamics of autocatalytic interactions ( where the chemical reaction rates are dynamic and depend on the reaction products ) , biological networks @xcite , and so on . in this paper , motivated by the above mentioned facts , we explore the role played by adaptive coupling on the synchronization in coupled oscillator systems .",
    "we find that adaptive coupling can induce the occurrence of multi - stable states in a system of coupled oscillators .",
    "we also find that the weight of the coupling strength and the plasticity of the coupling play a crucial role in controlling the occurrence of multi - stable states .",
    "further , we also find that the effect of asymmetry on the multi - stable states is such that it can drive the system from a multi - stable via phase desynchronized to a multi - stable state . here by a desynchronized state we essentially mean a coherent state as identified by aoki and aoyagi @xcite which corresponds to a fixed phase relationship between different oscillators as a function of time .",
    "however , in this state the oscillators are also distributed over the entire range @xmath0 and so the corresponding state is also called as a phase desynchronized state in the literature @xcite . in the following we use this later terminology with the understanding that it can also be described as coherent state .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the following sec . [ model ] we introduce the model of identical coupled phase oscillators which we take into consideration .",
    "we also give details about the numerical simulation we use . in sec .",
    "[ multi ] we demonstrate the occurrence of multi - stable states in the model we consider .",
    "we first ( sec . [ amulti ] ) show the absence of multi - stable states in the system without coupling plasticity .",
    "we then introduce coupling plasticity ( sec .",
    "[ bmulti ] ) and show how two different synchronization states coexist in the system . in sec .",
    "[ cmulti ] we demonstrate how the coupling time scale influences the occurrence of multi - stable states . in sec .",
    "[ phase lag ] we introduce a phase asymmetry in the system and demonstrate how it takes the system from a multi - stable state through a desynchronized state to a multi - stable state . in sec .",
    "[ ana ] , we provide an analytical basis for our numerical results . in sec .",
    "[ nio ] a brief discussion on the phase evolution in the case of nonidentical oscillators is given .",
    "finally we present the summary of our findings in sec .",
    "let us consider a system of coupled phase oscillators described by the following kuramoto - type  @xcite evolution equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the phase of the @xmath3th oscillator and @xmath4 is a @xmath5-periodic coupling function . here",
    "@xmath6 is the natural frequency of the oscillators and @xmath7 is the coupling strength between the oscillators .",
    "if @xmath7 is positive , it denotes attractive interaction between the oscillators and if @xmath7 is negative , it implies repulsive interaction . assuming that a given population of coupled oscillators in real life systems have both kinds of couplings ( attractive and repulsive or equivalently contrarian and conformist )",
    ", we replace @xmath7 by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the strength of the coupling between the oscillators in the system and the @xmath10 are the coupling weights between the oscillators .",
    "@xmath7 can also be assumed to have spin glass - type coupling @xmath11 .",
    "however in this type of coupling there will be no room for characterizing each oscillator in the system by an intrinsic property @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , models with such spin glass type interactions have been extensively studied by various authors @xcite .",
    "we consider the coupling weights @xmath10 to be dynamic , represented by the following dynamical equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a @xmath5-periodic function and can be called as the plasticity function @xcite which determines how the coupling weight depends on the relative timing of the oscillators .",
    "@xmath14 is the plasticity parameter .",
    "the evolution of the coupling is slower than the evolution of the oscillators when @xmath15 and the time scale of the coupling dynamics is given by @xmath16 .",
    "here we choose the simplest possible periodic functions for @xmath4 and @xmath13 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "such a coupling implies the fastest learning configuration in the system , that is , when the oscillators are in phase , the coupling coefficient grows fastest and when the oscillators are out - of - phase , the coupling coefficient decays fastest ( hebbian - like ) . with this choice ,",
    "the model equations can be rewritten as @xmath19 synchronization in the system can be quantified using the kuramoto order parameter , @xmath20        here @xmath21 is the coherence parameter that represents the strength of synchronization in the system .",
    "a complete synchronization in the system corresponds to @xmath22 , while complete phase desynchronization ( that is , every oscillator in the system has a corresponding oscillator that is in anti - phase synchronization with it ) corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "when there is a partial synchronization in the system , @xmath21 takes a value between @xmath24 and @xmath25 and quantifies the strength of synchronization ; that is , the value of @xmath21 is directly proportional to the number of oscillators that are in synchrony .    in our simulations ,",
    "we consider @xmath26 oscillators , ( except in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where we take n=1000 ) .",
    "we use a fourth order runge kutta routine to numerically simulate the system and we fix the time step to be 0.01 .",

    "let us explore the changes in the synchronization dynamics of system ( [ cho03 ] ) as affected by the plasticity in the coupling .",
    "we find that multi - stable synchronization states are generated by the system due to the presence of coupling plasticity . in order to demonstrate the same ,",

    "as an example , we choose the initial phase of the n=1 oscillator as @xmath24 and then for the subsequent oscillators the phase is increased in units of @xmath32 so that for the @xmath33 oscillator it is @xmath5 .",

    "when @xmath41 , the oscillators converge to a state of two synchronized clusters that are in antiphase relationship with each other .",

    "[ fig1 ] , it is obvious that the oscillators remain in the desynchronized state irrespective of the initial conditions , in the absence of coupling plasticity .",

    "the order parameters @xmath21 and @xmath38 also take values close to 0 in this case . @xmath7 and @xmath52 remain zero , since all the oscillators are uniformly distributed in [ -1,1 ] and the correlation remains at 1 indicating that this desynchronized state is a steady state ; that is the phase relation between any two oscillators in the system is fixed for all times .",
    "the transient behaviour of the order parameters @xmath21 , @xmath38 and the coupling strength @xmath7 for the case of no coupling plasticity is also included in panels ( b ) and ( e ) . in the absence of coupling plasticity the system takes much longer period of time to reach the asymptotic regime in the case of random distribution of initial phases .",
    "now let us introduce plasticity in the adaptive coupling in the system . in this case",
    ", the dynamics of the coupling weights depends upon the phase relation between the oscillators , and hence the initial phases of the oscillators strongly affect the synchronization states in the system .",

    "[ fig1 ] , that is , the oscillators remain phase desynchronized .",
    "however in the right panels ( d , e , f ) , when the initial phases are distributed randomly , we clearly see the emergence of a two - cluster synchronization state where the clusters are in antiphase relationship with each other , which is confirmed by @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 , even though the two clusters are in antiphase relationship , this implies that @xmath58 . in short , the two clusters do not have an equal number of oscillators in them .",
    "however the autocorrelation remains constant at a value close to 1 for both the initial conditions indicating that the phase relationship between the oscillators is asymptotically stable irrespective of whether the oscillators are synchronized or desynchronized .",

    "now let us see how the time scale of the coupling , denoted by @xmath16 , affects the multi - stable states .",
    "we see that the introduction of @xmath14 causes the occurrence of a two - clustered state , the clusters being in antiphase relationship with each other .",
    "it is also obvious that as @xmath14 increases @xmath21 increases while @xmath38 stays close to 1 .",
    "this essentially means that as @xmath14 increases , the size of one of the clusters grows and as a result , the two cluster state tends to become a single clustered state .",

    "[ fig4 ] where we have plotted the asymptotic * time evolution of @xmath2s for two different values of @xmath14 ; @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in panel",

    "however we see that @xmath21 takes different values for different @xmath14 indicating that the number difference between the two clusters increases with increasing @xmath14 see panels ( b),(c ) and ( d ) .        in order to visualize this clearly",

    "@xmath26 is the total number of oscillators .",
    "since there are only two clusters in the system of sizes @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we choose a random oscillator ( say , the first oscillator whose phase is denoted by @xmath82 ) , and compare the phases of all the other oscillators in the system with that of oscillator 1 .",
    "now , if the phase of any oscillator is equal to @xmath82 , then that oscillator is in the same cluster as that of the 1st oscillator and let us assume that this cluster has @xmath80 oscillators . on the other hand , if the phase of the oscillator is not equal to @xmath82 , then that oscillator is in the other cluster whose size is @xmath81 .",
    "this is how we count the number of oscillators in the two clusters numerically and have plotted the corresponding fractions @xmath83 and @xmath84 in panel ( b ) . in panels ( c ) and ( d )",
    "we have shown the number of oscillators in each of the two clusters @xmath85 as a function of time in the asymptotic regime for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the number difference between the two clusters increases for increasing @xmath14 and the value of @xmath70 matches the value of @xmath21 for the corresponding @xmath14 , in panel ( a ) .",
    "thus the coupling time scale affects the size of the clusters in the two - cluster state .",

    "[ fig11 ] , where we have chosen random initial phases .",
    "thus we find that the two cluster state arises only for the special choice of initial conditions near to the above state , while for an arbitrary initial distribution of phases one obtains a partially synchronized state , indicating the multistable nature of the underlying system .",
    "in the previous sections , we have studied the effect of plastic coupling between the group of identical oscillators(@xmath6 = constant ) . in the present section",

    "however , in the presence of adaptive coupling ( @xmath55 ) , for the uniform distribution of initial phases the system remains in desynchronized state ( @xmath116 ) see panel ( b ) , whereas for a random distribution the system sets into a different multicluster state ( @xmath50 and @xmath56 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , for a higher value of half width ( @xmath179 ) we find that the multicluster state loses its stability .",
    "the full details of the classification of this multicluster state for the case of nonidentical oscillators will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated the occurrence of multi - stable states in a system of phase oscillators that are dynamically coupled .",
    "we find that the presence of coupling plasticity induces the occurrence of such multi - stable states ; that is , the existence of a desynchronized state and a two - clustered state where the clusters are in anti - phase relationship with each other .",
    "the multi - stable states occur for randomly distributed initial phases while for uniformly distributed initial phases only the desynchronization state exists .",
    "we also find that the phase relationship between the oscillators is asymptotically stable irrespective of whether there is synchronization or desynchronization in the system .",
    "we find that the effect of coupling time scale ( @xmath16 ) is not only to introduce a two clustered state but also to change the number of oscillators in the two clusters .",
    "more precisely , we see that the difference between the number of oscillators in the two clusters increases with increasing @xmath14 . in short ,",
    "the coupling time scale is found to affect the size of the clusters in the two cluster state .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of coupling asymmetry and plasticity asymmetry on the multi - stable states .",
    "we find that , in the absence of coupling asymmetry , increasing plasticity asymmetry takes the system to transit from a multi - stable state through a desynchronized state to a multi - stable transition . if the coupling asymmetry is present , we find that the regions corresponding to two cluster states shrink and the region corresponding to desynchronization state expands .    in our model , for a uniform distribution of initial phases ,",
    "the desynchronized state is always stable . for random initial conditions ,",
    "the system goes from a two cluster synchronization state ( the desynchronization state exists also in this state ) to a desynchronized state and then again to a two cluster state , upon increasing the plasticity asymmetry parameter @xmath87 .",
    "thus the desynchronization state is always stable for the uniform distribution initial condition .",
    "thus the two cluster - desynchronization - two cluster transition can also be termed as multi - stable @xmath180 desynchronization @xmath180 multi stable state .",
    "we have also analytically investigated the linear stability of the desynchronized and the two cluster states in the limit @xmath181 and have found the occurrence of multi - stable @xmath180 desynchronization @xmath180 multi - stable state transition .",
    "our analytical results are in good agreement with our numerical observations .",
    "we strongly believe that the model discussed here and the results therein will help fill the gap in the understanding of the dynamical aspects of adaptively coupled systems which are found to be most common in real world complex networks .",
