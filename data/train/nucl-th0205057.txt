    "the in - medium modifications of the light vector mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) receive growing attention both from theoretical and experimental sides . on the theoretical side",
    "there are various indications concerning an important sensitivity of vector mesons to partial restoration of chiral symmetry in a hot and dense nuclear medium .",
    "in particular , at finite temperature the vector and axial - vector correlation functions , which are related to the meson spectral densities , become mixed in accordance with in - medium weinberg sum rules @xcite . at low temperature",
    "this mixing can be expressed directly via vacuum correlators in a model independent way @xcite .",
    "additionally , as shown within lattice qcd @xcite and various effective model calculations @xcite , the chiral quark condensate as order parameter decreases with increasing temperature and baryon density . within the qcd sum rule approach , considerable in - medium modifications of vector meson masses even at normal nuclear matter density",
    "have been predicted @xcite .    on the experimental side",
    "there is the idea to probe the in - medium modifications of vector mesons , in particular mass shifts , by measuring dileptons ( @xmath3 ) from meson decays .",
    "this is the primary motivation of the presently starting experiments with the hades detector @xcite at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at gsi darmstadt . at higher beam energies the heavy - ion experiments of the ceres collaboration",
    "@xcite evidenced already hints to a noticeable modification of the dilepton spectrum which can be reproduced under the assumption of a strong melting of the @xmath0 meson in a dense , strongly interacting medium at temperatures close to the chiral transition @xcite .",
    "while numerous evaluations of qcd sum rules have been performed during the last decade , the majority of them deal either with cold nucleon matter or a hot pion medium . at the same time , to extract the wanted information on the behavior of in - medium mesons via measurements in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies one has to study the case of finite baryon density temperature . in this paper",
    "we present evaluations of the qcd sum rules for the light in - medium vector mesons in a density - temperature region which is relevant for experiments like the ones at hades .",
    "we study systematically here the relative numerical contributions of the four - quark condensate to the qcd borel sum rule to find out the general trends of the vector meson mass dependence on density and temperature with respect to variations of the poorly known four - quark condensate .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recapitulate the general structure of the qcd borel sum rule .",

    "since we focus on the limit @xmath14 in the rest frame of the medium , only the longitudinal invariant @xmath15 of the correlator ( [ eq_1 ] ) is needed in our analysis .",

    "it is remarkable that in the considered region ( @xmath22 real ) the ope for @xmath17 is the same as the ope for the causal ( feynman ) correlator .",

    "( to adjust the vacuum value of the @xmath2 meson mass we employ @xmath194 and the values of parameters as listed in table  1 . )",
    "this is in agreement with results of @xcite obtained at @xmath65 . due to the weak dependence of the chiral quark condensate on temperature the linear decrease of @xmath193 with increasing nucleon density holds in a wide range of temperatures up to 140 mev .",
    "we also find a very tiny change of @xmath193 by variations of the four - quark condensate due to the density dependence . from the above analyses one can conclude that just the measurement of the @xmath2 meson mass shift in a nucleon medium is most appropriate to search for in - medium modifications of the chiral quark condensate . in addition",
    ", the @xmath2 meson is expected to keep its quasi - particle character as narrow resonance @xcite .",
    "such measurements can be accomplished at hades in heavy - ion experiments along with pion or proton induced @xmath2 production at nuclei .",
    "in summary we present for the first time a systematic analysis of the qcd borel sum rules for light vector mesons at finite nucleon density temperature .",
    "our approach is based on the dilute gas approximation for a nucleon medium which is appropriate at not too large nucleon density ( say , @xmath195 ) and temperature ( say , @xmath196 mev ) .",
    "such conditions are expected to be reached in heavy - ion experiments at hades .",
    "we find that in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons masses are dominated , within the borel qsr approach , by the dependence of the four - quark condensate @xmath197 on density and temperature .",
    "in particular , the numerical value of the parameter @xmath79 , which describes the strength of the linear density dependence of @xmath197 governs the decrease of the @xmath0 meson as a function on the density . at the same time an experimental identification of the @xmath0 meson mass shift is closely related to the problem of the strong broadening of its in - medium width .",
    "this needs separate considerations with the borel qsr including higher density and temperature effects into the ope side .",
    "( for a possible strategy to get access to a strongly broadened @xmath0 meson by means of the double differential @xmath3 spectra we refer the interested reader to @xcite . )    for the @xmath1 meson the sign of the in - medium mass shift is changed by variation of the parameter @xmath79 .",
    "this also points to the crucial role of the poorly known four - quark condensate and makes definite predictions difficult .",
    "a direct measurement of the in - medium mass shift can give , within the considered framework , an important information on the in - medium behavior of the four - quark condensate .",
    "since the difference of the vector and axial - vector correlation functions is proportional to the four - quark condensate the measured sign of the vector meson mass shift can serve , via the four - quark condensate , as a tool for determining how fast the nucleon system approaches the chiral symmetry restoration with increasing density .",
    "the in - medium @xmath2 meson mass shift is directly related to the behavior of the chiral strange quark condensate @xmath192 which decreases with density almost independently of the temperature in a wide region of density and temperature .",
    "this offers the chance to measure the density dependence of the chiral quark condensate via an in - medium mass shift of the @xmath2 meson in heavy - ion experiments , supposed the strangeness factor @xmath70 is not too small @xcite . since at nuclear saturation density",
    "the mass shift is already noticeable , one can also complementary search for a @xmath2 meson mass shift in hadron - nucleus reactions at the hades detector under suitable kinematical conditions .",
