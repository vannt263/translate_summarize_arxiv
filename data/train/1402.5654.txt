    "in recent decades , measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ; e.g. @xcite ) have proven the very early universe to be remarkably isotropic with tiny under- and overdensities that have grown to form the vast and intricate structures we see today .",
    "galaxies and clusters observed today are far removed from their almost homogeneous beginnings and we require large numbers of them to piece together a statistical picture on cosmological scales . clustering measures on large scales can be used to investigate not only the relationships between galaxy populations found by various techniques probing different epochs and masses , but also broader cosmological phenomena such as baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ; e.g. @xcite ) , cosmic magnification ( e.g. @xcite ) , or the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological applications require information about the gravitating mass distribution in the universe , which in a @xmath16cdm cosmology is strongly tied to the dark matter distribution .",
    "direct observations tell us only about the baryonic matter , from which we must infer the dark matter distribution .",
    "various tools exist for measuring the clustering signal of an observed source catalogue , such as nearest neighbour measures ( e.g. @xcite ) , counts - in - cells ( e.g. @xcite ) , correlation functions ( e.g. @xcite ) and power spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) . due to its relative simplicity to calculate , and relation to its fourier transform ( the power spectrum ) , the two - point spatial correlation function has become a standard in quantifying cosmological structure .",
    "a means by which we can quantify the extent to which the observable and dark matter are tied using the correlation function is through the bias parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this relates the spatial correlation function ( see section [ spatial ] ) of an observed galaxy population to that of the underlying dark matter .",
    "the bias quantifies the difference in the clustering of the dark matter haloes acting solely under gravity and of galaxies inhabiting those haloes with other effects making their structure more or less diffuse .",
    "this has a heavy dependence on the galaxy masses and the epoch under consideration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "local galaxies with masses comparable to the milky way are a relatively unbiased tracer of mass , with a present day correlation length ( the clustering scale at which the correlation function falls below unity ; see section [ spatial ] ) of @xmath18 @xmath4mpc found in the early cfa redshift survey @xcite .",
    "while the power law slope is consistently found to be @xmath13 in most studies , large variations in @xmath8 are found depending on the populations and respective epochs being observed , from @xmath19 @xmath4mpc for local galaxies to @xmath20 @xmath4mpc for abell clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) . at the lower end of the clustering scale , @xcite find @xmath21 @xmath4mpc for iras starburst galaxies and using the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite show a scale roughly constant with redshift at @xmath19 @xmath4mpc for quasars at @xmath22 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , @xcite find that @xmath23 ly-@xmath24 emitters exhibit a relatively short clustering length of @xmath25 @xmath4mpc , consistent with their being progenitors of milky way type local galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and note the similarity with lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , suggesting that the two populations reside in the same host halos but with a relatively low duty cycle .",
    "local @xmath28 ellipticals , however , are a highly clustered population with various authors finding @xmath29@xmath30 @xmath4mpc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly high clustering lengths are found for extremely red objects ( eros ) at @xmath31 ( e.g. @xcite ) and distant red galaxies ( drgs ) at @xmath3212 @xcite , both posited as progenitors of the local bright ellipticals .",
    "indeed , similar results for radio galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) give weight to the suggestion by @xcite that eros and radio galaxies are identical and seen at different evolutionary stages , based on their findings of ero - like hosts of radio galaxies in the 7c redshift survey .",
    "radio surveys are ideal for the purpose of carrying out such large - scale statistical measurements for a number of reasons . from a logistical point of view ,",
    "radio wavelengths are useful because they occupy a uniquely broad atmospheric window in the electromagnetic spectrum , not being significantly absorbed by earth s atmosphere .",
    "this allows observations to be carried out from terrestrial telescopes , reducing costs compared with launching and operating space telescopes in orbit . in a wide radio survey with relatively shallow flux density limit ( @xmath33 mjy )",
    "extragalactic sources dominate in the form of synchrotron radiation in active galaxies with supermassive black holes at their centre . by observing such powerful sources , and with the long radio wavelengths being immune to absorption by dust , the ism and our own atmosphere , ground based telescopes are able to observe the whole sky relatively unobscured and to very high redshifts .    of particular significance for the science discussed here",
    "is that these radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) predominantly reside in massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and , as such , provide good tracers of large - scale clustering and the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "radio surveys have been exploited with this aim for some time , such as the 4.85 ghz 87 gb @xcite and parkes - mit - nrao @xcite surveys , the 325 mhz westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; @xcite ) and 1.4 ghz vla surveys , faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ; @xcite ) and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , but their potential uses are limited without additional data at other wavelengths . while the large redshift range of radio surveys can be advantageous over more targeted optical surveys , this can also wash out the clustering signal due to the superposition of the influence of differently behaving subpopulations ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "this effect can be alleviated by the use of complementary optical surveys to aid the separation of radio sources by simple redshift binning or other methods .    as technology advances , observations at radio wavelengths",
    "will be able to constrain cosmological parameters with more precision than ever @xcite , as well as provide the data for much more galactic and extragalactic science @xcite . moving forward",
    ", the large numbers of sources observed in various overlapping surveys will make multi - wavelength studies not only more common , but essential to reliably identify objects by their emission across the entire spectrum and delineate the clustering properties of various subpopulations of any given individual survey .",
    "it is with this goal in mind that in this paper we combine the available radio data from the first survey , and optical / near - infrared photometry and spectra from galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ; @xcite ) , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) to measure the large scale clustering properties of the @xmath34 mjy radio emitting galaxies .",
    "we choose to use first over nvss for its marginally greater depth and considerably better resolution which is essential for meaningful cross - identification with the optical surveys .",
    "furthermore , we employ a parent redshift distribution from the simulated radio catalogue of the ska design study ( skads ; @xcite ) which has the express intention of acting as a test bed to inform the use of the forthcoming square kilometre array .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : section [ data ] describes the surveys and catalogues used , while sections [ angular ] and [ limber ] detail the angular correlation function measurements and their deprojection to infer spatial clustering properties .",
    "section [ spatial ] describes direct measurements of the spatial clustering properties through the spatial correlation function and projected correlation function and section [ massbias ] describes the linear bias found from each of these methods out to @xmath35 . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarise our results and conclusions .",
    "the cosmological model used throughout this paper is the flat , @xmath16cdm concordance cosmology where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "all distances are kept in units of @xmath4mpc where @xmath39 km s@xmath40mpc@xmath40 and @xmath41 is not explicitly assumed .",
    "to infer the spatial clustering parameters of the radio galaxy population , redshifts of the sources ( or their redshift distribution , at least ) are required .",
    "we use spectroscopic redshifts from the gama survey , supplemented by photometric redshifts calculated using optical and near infrared photometry from sdss and ukidss ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "these redshift catalogues are cross - matched with radio sources from the first survey to assign optical counterparts and redshifts to each radio source .",
    "the first survey @xcite was carried out at an observing frequency of 1.4 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) in b configuration .",
    "the most recent catalogue contains 946,464 sources covering over 10,000 square degrees ( @xmath428,500 in the northern galactic cap and @xmath421,500 in the south ) with an angular resolution of 5.4(fwhm ) to a completeness of 95 per cent at @xmath43 2 mjy .",
    "a number of sidelobes are spuriously counted in the raw catalogue and an oblique decision - tree program developed by the first survey team @xcite finds probabilities of each catalogue entry representing extended activity from a nearby bright source .",
    "those entries with a sidelobe probability of @xmath440.1 have been excluded for the purposes of this analysis ( @xmath4520 per cent of the catalogue ) , leaving 723,934 sources above 1 mjy .    )",

    "these were chosen to be large enough in area to fully sample @xmath42100 @xmath4mpc structures at @xmath52 , and for their overlap with existing surveys .",
    "the data used for this paper come from the first 3 years of observations ( gama phase i ; @xcite ) .",
    "the overlap of the gama survey area with other surveys allows for the collection of sufficient photometry to be able to generate a large contribution to the redshift catalogue using photometric redshifts .",

    "their value of @xmath80 @xmath4mpc is lower than for our sample , but perhaps by no more than expected given their lower redshifts and preferential selection of optically brighter sources .",

    "this increases the redshift from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , and the correlation length to @xmath83 @xmath4mpc , similar to that of our sample @xmath6 , shown in figure [ r0 ] .",
    "we would expect to observe clustering between these two values , albeit boosted due to our sample having a higher median redshift .",
    "the close agreement with these past surveys also suggests that our analysis accounting for the noise variations in the gama fields is robust .",
    "the differences in clustering of different classes of extragalactic objects and the background matter distribution motivates the use of some bias parameter , @xmath84 , as introduced by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath85 where the numerator and denominators are the galaxy and dark matter correlation functions , respectively .    the bias parameter can be determined directly if both the real- and redshift - space forms of the correlation function are known .",
    "the ratio of the two can be approximated by a quadratic in the infall parameter @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "therefore , with a good estimate of the real- and redshift - space correlation functions , one may calculate the ratio of the two and thereby the bias .",
    "we are able to infer the real - space correlation length @xmath8 from the angular correlation function ( section [ limber ] ) or the projected correlation function ( section [ projxi ] ) .",

    "the bias inferred from the angular correlation function is shown in table [ parameters ] for both @xmath93 values corresponding to linear and comoving clustering evolution .",
    "these results are compared in figure [ bias ] with the bias model by @xcite used by @xcite in populating dark matter haloes in the skads simulations .",
    "they assign a particular halo mass to each source type in the simulation : fri , frii and radio - quiet agn , normal star - forming galaxies and starbursts , with assumed halo masses of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 , respectively , and impose a plateau for each model at high redshifts above which the assumption of a fixed halo mass breaks down .",
    "the model @xmath17 for each of these source types is denoted by a black dotted line , showing the stronger bias for those objects residing in more massive haloes .    by weighting the skads sources by the ratio between the sample and skads redshift distributions , we have estimated the relative proportions of the population masses . calculating the model bias of the sample as the weighted mean of the biases of each individual population , we show a predicted bias at the 5 different redshifts probed in figure [ bias ] ( _ open diamonds _ ) , accounting for the change in galaxy halo mass being observed .",
    "these follow the same trend as our measurements , with the bias rising more steeply with redshift than any individual model population owing to the increasing agn fraction towards higher @xmath100 .",
    "our measurements over the gama fields agree qualitatively with the model , but with those associated only with the gama fields exceeding the predictions to varying degrees . for those sources with measured redshifts ,",
    "the difference is within the stated errors , but at higher redshifts our measurements exceed the skads bias values by @xmath101 ( we return to this point in section [ biasdiscussion ] ) .",
    "the spatial correlation function of spectroscopic sources provides one additional data point for the bias at a redshift of @xmath102 , similar to the @xmath103 subsample of combined spectroscopic and photometric matches .",
    "table [ xipar ] shows @xmath8 and @xmath104 derived from @xmath105 and @xmath66 respectively , and the inferred bias ( where redshift - space effects are wrongly ignored in the case of the former ) .",
    "we find a bias of @xmath106 for the redshift - space calculation of the bias , with a real - space equivalent of @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "the results from @xmath66 are shown in figure [ bias ] for comparison with the angular clustering results .      within our matched sample and incorporating simulated data",
    ", we observe the increasing of @xmath17 in line with models corresponding to fixed masses @xcite , although we find a relatively high value for the high - redshift sources , particularly when using the linear clustering parameter .",
    "whilst the gama data points do not place especially tight constraints on this evolution , and the well - constrained point from @xmath66 is limited to one epoch , the assumption of the redshift distributions for the full and unmatched subsamples probe redshifts up to @xmath107 and give more shape to the evolution .",
    "the agreement is good at lower redshifts , the gama - matched results ( _ red _ ) lying @xmath108 from the model prediction as well as agreeing with the 2slaq radio - detected lrgs examined by @xcite ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the higher redshift points , however , significantly exceed the values prescribed in the skads simulation .",
    "the wider first sample is an exception , falling significantly below the trend displayed by the narrower samples , but closely matching the mo & white bias prescription from skads . on face value , this apparent excess clustering suggests a greater proportion of agn observed than was assumed in the simulations , or perhaps a considerable underestimate of the typical halo masses of any or all of the galaxy types considered .",
    "our unmatched first sources , especially , in the gama field are more strongly clustered than would be expected by simply subtracting the cross - matched @xmath110 from the skads @xmath110 and assuming the same population as a matching skads sample .",
    "this means either that the assumed redshift distribution is skewed towards low redshift , or the fraction of more massive galaxies is higher than expected .",
    "inspection of figure  [ zdists ] shows that our assumed @xmath110 for this point contains a significant fraction of @xmath103 sources where one would expect to observe a greater proportion of less massive , star - forming galaxies rather than the more massive agn .",
    "given that if these low - redshift objects were detected in first , we would expect them to have optical counterparts in sdss / gama ( cf .",
    "almost complete cross - identification at @xmath111 in figure [ zdists ] ) , it is perhaps unrealistic to assume these missing low-@xmath100 sources remain in our unmatched sample .",
    "the cause of this large fraction of unmatched sources is discussed in section  [ redshifts ] , however to determine the effect that these sources have on our measured clustering length and bias we implement cuts on the skads redshift distribution , where we remove all sources at @xmath112 and @xmath113 from the simulations .",
    "this is a coarse way of simulating the combined effect of the resolution bias and the removal of very low - redshift sources with photometric redshifts with @xmath114 .",
    "we then recalculate the correlation length and bias using these new redshift distributions and find that the correlation length and bias increases significantly ( @xmath422550 per cent increase in bias ) .",
    "although subject to many uncertainties , this may point to a higher proportion of highly biased objects in the radio source population at high redshift .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in the skads simulation is indeed the evolution and bias of the fri - type objects which dominate the source counts at the flux density limit of the first survey at @xmath115 . in the skads simulation",
    "the fris are less biased than the friis , however it is becoming clear that there is a large overlap in the stellar mass distributions between the generally less radio luminous fris and their frii counterparts at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus it is possible that the bias prescription for the fri sources in the skads simulation is underestimated .",
    "if we assign a similar halo mass to the fri as for the friis then we find that the expected average bias of radio sources in our sample ( @xmath116 ) to be in the region of @xmath117 , this is much more closely aligned with our measured value of @xmath118 .",
    "deeper surveys over smaller areas will be able to address this issue better than the relatively shallow first data .",
    "indeed , deep multi - wavelength surveys are now beginning to tackle the question of redshift evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and with slightly more area could measure the clustering length .",
    "using radio observations from the first survey and optical / infrared data ( sdss / ukidss las ) over the gama survey field area , we have obtained a cross - matched sample of radio galaxies with optical host galaxy redshifts ( @xmath4242 per cent spectroscopic ) .",
    "we have measured the redshift - space and projected correlation functions of these spectroscopic identifications from gama , as well as the angular correlation function of radio sources over the extended gama survey area .",
    "assuming parent redshift distributions from skads @xcite , we have inferred the spatial correlation length @xmath8 and the mass bias @xmath17 for the matched radio sources and the radio sources without optical identifications , extending our redshift range up to @xmath119 .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the projected correlation function of first sources with gama spectroscopic counterparts provides a well - constrained correlation length and linear bias of @xmath69 @xmath4mpc and @xmath120 at @xmath121 .",
    "2 .   the angular correlation function follows a power law but we find a steeper slope of @xmath122 compared with that found for other classes of galaxy and often assumed in the literature .",
    "3 .   our cross - matched sample yields a spatial correlation length of @xmath123 @xmath4mpc to @xmath124 @xmath4mpc at @xmath125 ( assuming stable clustering evolution ) . adding the assumption of the skads parent @xmath110",
    ", we measure the clustering length up to median redshift @xmath126 , where we find @xmath127 @xmath4mpc .",
    "we measure the bias as a function of redshift across the subsamples finding it to increase from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "these values were compared with predicted values from a model assuming population fractions and masses from skads and were in qualitative agreement but exceeding the prescribed values at high redshift .",
    "this is most probably due to a combination of surface density fluctuation in the first survey , leading to a shortfall of sources at @xmath130mjy which in turn biases our sample towards a higher fraction of strongly clustered agn at high redshifts and/or potential inaccuracies in the halo masses of particular radio subpopulations used in skads .",
    "if we assign a similar halo mass to the fri sources as assumed for the frii sources in our radio survey then we find that we can reproduce our bias value at high redshift .",
    "a more highly biased fri population may in turn lead to a highly biased tracer of the high - redshift universe for cosmological applications with radio surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while we place modest constraints on the clustering evolution of mjy radio sources and suffer from limited cross - identification with the optical surveys , our use of a well - constrained redshift distribution from skads allows us to extend our redshift range to @xmath131 .",
    "this highlights some potentially important discrepancies with a simple model bias , implying stronger clustering at higher redshifts than is expected from the fixed halo masses assumed in the skads simulations through some combination of a greater proportion of massive agn than previously thought and/or an increased typical halo mass being observed . in a future paper , we analyse deep field data to help confirm our high - redshift bias estimates .",
