    "some systems have an orbital period of less than @xmath101 hour ( ultra  compact x  ray binaries ; ucxbs ) .",

    "@xcite predict that about half of the total population of lmxbs may be in ucxbs .",

    "ray transients has several  year long outbursts before they return to quiescence .",
    "these quasi  persistent systems provide an ideal testing ground since the accretion history is well  constraint .",
    "furthermore , the idea is that the long outburst has heated the neutron star crust to temperatures higher than that of the neutron star core .",
    "therefore , the ( evolution of the ) quiescent x  ray luminosity provides information on the cooling properties of the neutron star , which in turn depend on the neutron star equation of state ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    1 m  1716315 was first detected in oso7 observations obtained between sept .",

    "these and other ( shorter ) flares reported by @xcite would now most likely be classified as type  i x  ray bursts .",
    "the confirmation of the occurence of type  i x  ray bursts and hence of the neutron star nature of the compact object in 1 m  1716315 was given by the detection of three bursts by the hakucho satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "later hakucho detected a long radius expansion burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of this burst were used by @xcite to derive a distance of @xmath12 kpc ( @xcite derived d=5.16.9 kpc using the properties of the same burst ; the range depends on whether the burst was hydrogen or helium rich ) .",

    "the spectrum of the source is soft with a 95 per cent upper limit to a power law contribution of @xmath3219 per cent making it unlikely that this source is a background agn or an accreting white dwarf .",
    "the x  ray luminosity together with our stringent optical @xmath16band and near  infrared @xmath33band limits on the absolute magnitude rule out that the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum is due to coronal activity of a late type star .",

    "even though the detected number of counts for these sources is too low to fit a spectrum nearly all photons of all three sources are detected above 1.5 kev . together with the fact that their positions do not agree with the heao ",
    "i error region , this makes them less likely candidates for the quiescent neutron star sxt .",
    "we conclude that we have detected 1 m  1716315 in quiescence at a 0.510 kev source luminosity of @xmath34@xmath35 erg s@xmath1 . fixing the value for the interstellar n@xmath28 to the value given in @xcite [ ( 2.1@xmath70.6)@xmath17@xmath36 @xmath14 ] the resultant blackbody and",
    "neutron star atmosphere temperature is rather high for a neutron star sxt in quiescence , especially when taking into account that the source has been in quiescence for more than @xmath1116 years ( see below ) .",
    "we note that the n@xmath28 value given in table 12 of @xcite depends on the spectral model that was used , both an absorbed blackbody plus thermal bremsstrahlung as well as comptonisation models give a n@xmath28 value of 45@xmath1710@xmath38 @xmath14 ( see tables 7 and 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , when left as a free parameter in our x  ray spectral fits the n@xmath28 is somewhat higher , although still consistent within 3  @xmath39 with the value of ( 2.1@xmath70.6)@xmath17@xmath36 @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath16band observations do not reveal an optical counterpart in the 99 per cent confidence 036 error circle down to a magnitude limit of @xmath40 . using this limit and converting the n@xmath28 observed in outburst giving a@xmath41 ( @xcite ) , taking d=5.16.9 kpc ( @xcite )",
    "we derive that the absolute @xmath16band magnitude m@xmath42 .",
    "equivalent calculations for the @xmath33 band measurements result in @xmath33@xmath435.15.8 .",
    "hence , like 1h  1905 + 000 ( @xcite ) 1 m  1716315 is a candidate ucxb , although the secondary could also be an m dwarf .",
    "however , additional ( circumstantial ) evidence for an ultra  compact nature comes from the detected long ( @xmath1110 minutes ) type i burst duration ( @xcite )",
    ". such long bursts can occur in sources accreting he at a low rate in ultra  compact x ",
    "ray binaries ( see discussion in @xcite ) or sources accreting h  rich material at even lower rates ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the luminosity in outburst in the case of 1 m  1716315 was found to be above 10@xmath44 erg s@xmath1 the latter mode is less likely .",
    "the quiescent x  ray luminosity of 1 m  1716315 is higher than that of other ( likely ) ucxbs in quiescence ( xte  j1751305 , xte  j0929314 , xte  j1807294 , and 1h  1905 + 000 ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "a plausible explanation for the higher quiescent luminosity is that the time  averaged mass accretion rate is higher in 1 m  1716315 than in the other ucxbs observed so far , possibly due to a shorter orbital period ( @xcite ) .     @xmath14 as found from spectra obtained in outburst by einstein ( @xcite ) .",
