    "for non - equilibrium phenomena , many relations have been proposed @xcite about the current fluctuations .",
    "the first relation being proposed is fluctuation theorem @xcite which was demonstrated experimentally @xcite and is shown @xcite to be consistent with green - kubo relations @xcite .",
    "fluctuations is closely related to probability distribution .",
    "the gaussian distribution has been observed in simulation @xcite and experiment @xcite .",
    "in fact , the gaussian distribution can be obtained by statistical analysis if it arises from the binomial distribution .",
    "when a weak external force is applied , the current fluctuations will be the same except that the mean value will shift by an amount proportional to the external force .",
    "one example is ionic conduction , see fig .",
    "[ ions ] . here",
    "the external force is electric field . for a given electric field , the larger the electric current ,",
    "the larger the entropy production rate will be . thus the electric field always tends to increase the electric current in order to maximize the entropy production @xcite .",
    "this tendency must be counterbalanced .",
    "a competition has been identified between the entropy production rate and the current fluctuations @xcite .",
    "specifically , the competition is between environment entropy and system entropy which is to describe the intensity of the current fluctuations .    in this paper",
    ", we study the ionic conduction with both statistical analysis and entropy competition to produce a fluctuation relation .",
    "a time parameter @xmath0 is introduced into the relation for the convenience of simulation and experiment .",
    "now let us derive the ionic electrical conductivity .",
    "we will do this in a new way different from the ways in work @xcite .",
    "[ ions ] shows a solid ionic conductor in the equilibrium state .",
    "the conductor has @xmath1 interstitial ions , which during a time interval @xmath0 make @xmath2 jumps , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ion number density , @xmath5 is the conductor volume and @xmath6 is the mean jump time .",
    "of all the jumps , @xmath7 of them are in the up ( + ) direction and @xmath8 are in the down ( - ) direction . here",
    "@xmath9 follows a binomial distribution , which , when @xmath10 , will become a normal distribution , @xmath11    for a given @xmath9 , there is a corresponding electric current , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ion charge and @xmath14 is the lattice constant .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ pk ] ) can be recast as @xmath15 by introducing a variance , @xmath16 it can be written as @xmath17 if the total number of the microscopic states is @xmath18 ( for our example , @xmath19 ) , the number of microscopic states for a given @xmath20 is @xmath21 the corresponding entropy is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "we call this the system entropy @xcite . the system entropy is to describe the system in the equilibrium state .",
    "the system for this example consists of only those interstitial ions that are responsible for the electric current .",
    "when there exists an external electric field @xmath24 , an environment entropy @xcite also has to be introduced , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the temperature and @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "the environment entropy is introduced by considering @xmath28 where @xmath29 is heat generated by the electric current in the form @xmath30 .",
    "the environment here includes everything except the system .",
    "it includes the surroundings and the lattice of the conductor .",
    "consequently , the overall entropy is @xmath31 therefore the probability distribution is @xmath32 which indicates that the most probable current is @xmath33 for a macroscopic system in linear regime ( @xmath10 ) , the most probable current is equal to the average current which is associated with electrical conductivity .",
    "therefore , the electrical conductivity is extracted as @xmath34 by eq .",
    "( [ lastone ] ) , it becomes @xmath35 .",
    "this is the ionic electrical conductivity that has been obtained in studies @xcite .",
    "but it has been derived here again in a new way , especially a parameter @xmath0 has been introduced .",
    "although the relation ( [ sigma_e ] ) has been derived theoretically from statistical analysis , it can be extended to be suitable for computer simulations .",
    "for that , we write @xmath36 which can be observed in simulations . consequently the electrical conductivity is in the form @xmath37 this is a novel relation for ionic conduction between electrical conductivity and electric current fluctuations .",
    "note that @xmath20 and @xmath38 are about the equilibrium state .",
    "also note that there is no requirement for @xmath0 .",
    "but it is safe to choose @xmath39 .",
    "for ionic conductivity , we have presented a relation between electrical conductivity and electric current fluctuations .",
    "electric current fluctuations is described by gaussian distribution , from which the system entropy is obtained .",
    "but when an electric field exists , an additional entropy  environment entropy  has to be introduced .",
    "the two entropies add .",
    "the total entropy gives the current probability distribution .",
    "a relation about the electrical conductivity is finally obtained .",
    "but note that the relation is obtained from the example of ionic conduction which has a unique property : an ion jumps from site to site , which is very different from the way that an ion move through an open space or a liquid .",
    "this means that the relation can not apply directly to ionic conduction in gas or liquid .",
