    "thomson scattering of laser beam photons by moderately relativistic electrons ( with energy on the order of tens mev ) has been proposed as a source of hard x - ray radiation in the range of 10100 kev @xcite .",
    "the x - ray radiation from such a source ( laser  electron x - ray generator ",
    "lexg ) is expected to be tightly collimated and therefore to possess a high spectral brilliance thus making it suitable for a wide range of applications @xcite including the spectroscopy ( exafs and xanes ) @xcite , ordinary and phase x - ray tomography @xcite , x - ray structural analysis @xcite as well as in biology and medicine @xcite .",
    "theoretical and numerical analysis of properties of the lexg radiation has attracted significant attention @xcite .",
    "however one aspect has not , in our opinion , been sufficiently addressed yet .",
    "this is the polarization of the outgoing x - ray radiation and its dependence on the laser beam polarization and the properties of electron beam  especially on its emittance .",
    "some formulas for the polarization of the compton back - scattered gamma radiation were presented in @xcite but the authors focused their analysis primarily on the gamma radiation flux angular dependence and its spectral brilliance while giving polarization only a precursory treatment .",
    "it should be noted that the polarization of back - scattered gamma radiation is important in nuclear physics and it has been experimentally measured @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was also used as a tool to measure the polarization of electron and positron beams @xcite .    from general considerations",
    "it follows that the finite emittance of electron beam should cause degradation of the polarization degree of x - ray radiation changing it from unity ( full polarization ) , which is expected for the illumination by a fully polarized laser beam .",
    "moreover , all three stocks parameters of the x - ray radiation can change significantly if the electron beam has a finite emittance . in the present paper",
    "we derive general formulas for the polarization of the x - ray radiation emitted by lexg . using the specially written program code",
    "we conduct a number of numerical experiments for a range of laser and electron beam parameters .",
    "we demonstrate how the finite emittance of electron beam degrades and generally affects the x - ray radiation polarization .",
    "in the case considered in this paper  of x - ray radiation in the range of tens kiloelectronvolts produced by thomson scattering of an optical laser beam on an electron beam with a modest electron energy on the order of tens megaelectronvolts  the following approximations hold : photon  electron scattering can be treated as a classical scattering of zero mass particles ( photons ) by finite mass particles ( electrons ) .",
    "this approximation neglects both quantum and wave effects .",
    "the process is characterized by a differential cross - section , which depends in the general case on momentums and energies of both photons and electrons and on the polarization of photons . in the lexg x - ray radiation",
    "is assumed to arise as a result of collisions of trains of electron bunches with synchronized trains of optical ( laser ) pulses .",
    "the electron bunches can circulate in a storage ring or be produced by a linear accelerator .",
    "the polarization of both laser light and x - rays can be characterized by a hermitian polarization matrix of dimension @xmath0 , which can be represented in the following form @xmath1 where @xmath2  is the radiation intensity and @xmath3 , @xmath4  @xmath5  are the stocks parameters ( @xmath6 )",
    ". the polarization degree of the radiation is defined as @xcite @xmath7 where the intensity of the radiation can be expressed as @xmath8 .",

    ".    the cross - section matrix can be expressed through the polarization matrix of laser radiation @xmath43 as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45  is a symmetrical non - hermitian transformation matrix for the radiation field amplitudes , which is defined below , and @xmath43 is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48  @xmath49  are the stocks parameters of laser radiation .",
    "the number and polarization of emitted photons defined in (    [ q01 ] ) should be integrated over electron and laser photon momentums as well as over time to obtain the x - ray radiation flux and polarization ( in the matrix form ) emitted from an element of the spatial volume @xmath50 where @xmath51  is the circulation frequency of electron bunches in the storage ring of lexg or pulse frequency in the trains produced by the linear accelerator .",
    "expression ( [ q04 ] ) gives the flux and polarization of x - ray photons averaged over a large number of laser pulses and electron bunches from a 3d spatial volume element @xmath52 into a solid angle @xmath17 and frequency interval @xmath40 .",
    "using formula ( [ q04 ] ) the average flux and polarization of x - ray photons in solid angle @xmath17 and the frequency interval @xmath40 can be calculated as @xmath53 whereas the average spectral brilliance of the x - ray radiation in the direction @xmath11 and at the frequency @xmath54 is @xmath55 where @xmath56  is position of the observation point and @xmath57  is a narrow spectral interval usually assumed to be equal to @xmath58 .",
    "let s now introduce two stationary coordinate frames : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the first is related to the electron beam with its z - axis parallel to the average velocity of electron bunches and the second  to the laser beam with its @xmath61-axis parallel to the average direction of laser pulses .",
    "for such a choice of coordinate systems the collision angle between the laser and electron beams is close to @xmath62 .",
    "the general geometry of the electron beam  laser beam interaction used in this paper is shown in fig.[scheme ] .    to calculate the x - ray radiation polarization , as was noted above , a field amplitude transformation matrix @xmath63",
    "should be used instead of a scalar cross - section ( see ( [ q02 ] ) ) .",

    "the value of @xmath2 is equal to the x - ray radiation intensity produced by scattering of a naturally polarized laser beam . in particular , from ( [ q109 ] ) it can be seen that the fully polarized laser radiation ( @xmath79 ) produces the fully polarized x - ray radiation if the angular spread of electron momentums in the electron beam is neglected .",
    "expressions ( [ q105])([q108 ] ) correspond to formulas ( 35 ) from @xcite .",
    "coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be obtained from the differential cross - sections for linearly polarized light . for our purpose",
    "we can neglect all corrections to this cross - section related to collision angle @xmath80 between the laser and electron beams .",
    "such corrections are proportional to its difference @xmath81 from @xmath62 squared : @xmath82 and therefore they are very small .",
    "this allows one to use the cross - section for a head - on collision of an electron with a photon when @xmath83 . as it was shown in @xcite , the differential cross - section for linearly polarized laser beam",
    "can be written as @xmath84,\\label{q061}\\\\ \\frac{\\omega'}{\\omega_l}&=\\frac{1+v}{1-v\\cos\\theta},\\quad v=|\\mathbf{v}|,\\quad \\mathbf{vn}=v\\cos\\theta , \\label{q062}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where frequency @xmath85 is related to the laser frequency by formula ( [ q062 ] ) , @xmath86  is the angle between the electric field vector of laser beam and axis @xmath68 , @xmath87  is the thomson cross - section .",
    "coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 are obtained from ( [ q061 ] ) when @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "let s consider the spatial distributions of electrons and photons .",
    "since the betatron and synchrotron oscillations of electrons in a storage ring can be considered approximately independent from each other @xcite the volume densities @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be factorized into a transversal part ( @xmath92 ) and a longitudinal part ( @xmath93 ) , which determine the distribution of electrons and photons by the transversal momentum and coordinate and by the energy and longitudinal coordinate , respectively .",
    "so , the electron and photon distributions can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath95  @xmath96  are the total number of electrons and photons in an electron bunch and a laser pulse , respectively , @xmath97  is the temporal delay between an electron bunch and a laser pulse and @xmath98  is a vector accounting for the spatial shift between an electron bunch and a laser pulse .",
    "the longitudinal component of photon distribution function in ( [ q112 ] ) is assumed to have a gaussian form in space @xmath99 where @xmath100  is the laser pulse length and @xmath101  is the average frequency of laser radiation . in formula ( [ q12 ] ) the laser pulse",
    "is considered to be monochromatic , that is usually justified for sufficiently long ( @xmath102 ps ) pulses in the case of lexg .",
    "the longitudinal component of electron distribution function in ( [ q111 ] ) by coordinate @xmath69 and the energy ( @xmath37 ) is also gaussian @xmath103 where @xmath104  is the electron bunch length , @xmath105  is the average gamma factor of electron bunch and @xmath106  is the gamma factor distribution width .",
    "for transversal distribution functions in ( [ q111 ] ) and ( [ q112 ] ) the common form used in literature @xcite is that of a gaussian beam @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109  are the transversal electron momentum spreads along @xmath110 and @xmath68 axes , respectively and @xmath111  is a unit vector in the direction of laser beam .",
    "it is well known @xcite that @xmath112 and functions @xmath113 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116  is the beta function of electron beam at the interaction point in direction of @xmath110(@xmath68 ) axis , @xmath117  is the transversal emittance of electron beam in direction of @xmath110(@xmath68 ) axis and @xmath118  is the rayleigh length of laser beam . in ( [ q152 ] )",
    "the photon transversal momentum distribution is in the form of a delta function , which corresponds to the approximation considered above where the scattering cross - section does not depend on the collision angle between an electron and a photon .    in ( [ q13 ] ) ,",
    "( [ q151 ] ) and ( [ q152 ] ) the electron energy distribution as well as the electron transversal momentum distribution are considered to be independent from the spatial coordinates ",
    "an assumption , which is justified in case of lexg because the transversal sizes of both beams are relatively large .",
    "one can note that time is only present in the longitudinal components of electron and photon densities @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore the integral over time in ( [ q04 ] ) can be computed analytically @xmath121    we are now ready to write the final expression for polarization matrix @xmath122 from ( [ q04 ] ) using the cross - sections and distributions obtained above .",
    "so , taking into account integral ( [ q14 ] ) and averaging the cross - section matrix ( [ q104 ] ) over @xmath37 , expression ( [ q04 ] ) can be transformed into    @xmath123    where @xmath124  is the cross - section polarization matrix averaged over the distribution of @xmath37 , coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to each other by the following expressions ( see fig.[scheme ] ) consisting of two sequential rotations around @xmath110 and @xmath69 axes ( taking into account the axial symmetry of laser beam ) @xmath125 here @xmath126 is the observation angle and angle @xmath127 corresponds to the rotation around axis @xmath69 . in formulas ( [ q181 ] ) and ( [ q182 ] ) the collision angle @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) is not assumed to be equal to @xmath62 as in differential cross - section matrix ( [ q104 ] ) .",
    ".the lexg parameters used for numerical experiments [ cols=\">,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     taking into account that cross - section ( [ q062 ] ) contains a delta - function , the averaging over @xmath37 in @xmath39 ( see ( [ q105])([q108 ] ) ) can be performed analytically .",

    "the angles and energies were chosen to produce the radiation peaks at the same energy of 30 kev . ]    as it is clear from ( [ q19 ] ) , to calculate the x - ray polarization one should average the polarization matrix @xmath124 from ( [ q104 ] ) over the transversal spread of electron momentums .",
    "this operation is equivalent to averaging of expressions ( [ q105])([q108 ] ) and in a general case leads to a partial depolarization of initially fully polarized x - ray radiation .",
    "the averaging can not be performed analytically for an arbitrary observational angle . however , in the special case of zero observational angle @xmath126 the matrix elements @xmath72 and @xmath73 does not depend on the angle @xmath66 , which in this case is equal to the azimuth angle between an electron velocity and the average velocity of electron bunches .",
    "now expressions ( [ q105])([q108 ] ) can be analytically averaged over angle @xmath66 , which results in the following expressions @xmath134 to obtain polarization matrix @xmath135 expressions ( [ q26])([q29 ] ) need to be further averaged over the angle between the velocity of an electron and the average velocity of electron bunch .",
    "the result of such an averaging depends on the ratio of angular width of x - ray distribution in @xmath130 and @xmath131 to the width of angular spread of the electron momentums ( [ q151 ] ) .",
    "it can be noted that formulas ( [ q26])([q29 ] ) are the same as formulas ( 38 ) in @xcite .     and the corresponding electron energies as function of the x - ray radiation energy .",
    "the transversal spread of electron momentums was taken into account .",
    "the angles and energies were chosen to produce the radiation peaks at the same energy of 30 kev , as in fig.[f1 ] . ]",
    "to calculate the x - ray radiation characteristics of lexg a program code was written in the java programming language @xcite .",
    "the code is based on the model outlined in this paper .",
    "it is capable of computing the full polarization matrix of x - ray radiation for arbitrary lexg parameters .     and two x - ray energies as function of the observation angle .",
    "the transversal spread of electron momentums is taken into account . ]    to demonstrate how the transversal emittance and other beam parameters influence the polarization of the x - ray radiation we conducted a number of numerical experiments .",
    "the main parameters of lexg used in the calculations are shown in table [ tab1 ] . in the figures below the spectral brilliance and polarization of x - ray radiation of lexg with parameters from table [ tab1 ]",
    "are depicted as functions of various parameters .     and two x - ray energies as function of the electron and laser beam waist radii , which were considered equal .",

    "the collision angle of the electron and laser beams @xmath128 is set at 50 mrad . for convenience .",
    "] as it was noted above , the intensity of the naturally polarized light serves as the denominator in the calculation of the stocks parameters and degree of polarization of the x - ray radiation .    from fig.[f1",
    "] one can see that , in particular , the width of spectral brilliance curves significantly increases and the peak spectral brilliance significantly decreases as the observation angle grows .",
    "the curves are asymmetrical with respect to their maxima with long exponential tails in the direction of lower x - ray energies .",
    "they become progressively more symmetrical as the observational angle is increased .",
    "this asymmetry arises because at zero observational angle the x - ray radiation of higher energies is emitted by higher energy electrons moving strictly in the direction of the electron beam .",
    "there are only a few electrons due to the relatively narrow electron energy spectrum of ( [ q13 ] ) .",
    "the long exponential tail is created mainly by the electrons moving non - collinearly to the electron beam direction . the number of such electrons decreases exponentially as function of the angle according to ( [ q151 ] ) .    in fig.[f2 ] the x - ray radiation polarization degree for three observation angles @xmath126 and the electron energies @xmath38 as function of the x - ray radiation energy are shown .",
    "the transversal spread of the electron momentums is taken into account ",
    "the polarization degree would be unity without it .",
    "the collision angle @xmath128 is 50 mrad and the laser beam is linearly polarized with @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( the polarization plane was rotated by @xmath140 around @xmath69 axis relative to @xmath68 axis ) .",
    "it can be seen that the transversal electron momentum spread ( directly related to the transversal emittance ) causes a depolarization of the emitted x - ray radiation , which increases with the observation angle .",
    "it is clear that for the parameters listed in table [ tab1 ] depolarization of the x - ray radiation by the electron beam emittance is rather small  a few percent only .",
    "the polarization degree also approaches unity as the x - ray energy grows .",
    "significant depolarization is observed only for the x - ray energy less than its peak value in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the higher energy x - rays arise as a result of scattering by higher energy electrons , which move strictly in the direction of the electron beam , while the lower energy x - rays are produced by electrons moving at some angles to the electron beam direction .    in fig.[f3][f5 ]",
    "the degree of polarization for the same three electron energies as in fig.[f2 ] is plotted against the observation angle , beam waist diameter and relative electron energy spread @xmath136 for two x - ray energies 24 and 26 kev .",
    "the latter energies are less than the peak energies in fig.[f1 ] . in fig.[f4][f5 ] observation angles are the same as in fig.[f2 ] for the same electron beam energies .",
    "other parameters are are also the same as in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the polarization degree can exhibit rather complex behavior with local minima and maxima , see fig.[f3 ] .",
    "the polarization degree at 26 kev is generally higher than at 24 kev as in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "the origin of the non - monotonic behavior can be traced back to the interaction between the finite angular momentum spread of electron beam with the polarization parameters in ( [ q105])([q108 ] ) during the averaging over electron momentums . in fig.[f4 ]",
    "the polarization degree looks like a shelf when the beam s waist is small and the observational angle is zero ( solid curves ) .",
    "this behavior is explained by sort of a saturation of the polarization degradation when the transversal electron momentum spread exceeds x - ray beam angular width from ( [ q24])([q251 ] ) .",
    "the saturated polarization degree in this case is determined by average parameters ( [ q26])([q29 ] ) .",
    "in fig.[f5 ] the polarization degree increases with @xmath136 at smaller observation angles and weakly decreases at larger observation angles .",
    "such a behavior is explained by the fact that at smaller angles as the energy spread increases relatively more x - rays are emitted by electrons moving in the direction of electron beam , which reduces the angular spread of the contributing electrons . at larger angles",
    "the behavior switches in the opposite direction because a larger contribution from the electrons moving in the direction of electron beam means a larger angular spread of the contributing electrons .    in fig.[f6 ]",
    "stocks parameters as function of the x - ray energy are shown for observation angle of 5.6 mrad .",
    "the electron energy is set at 46.10 mev .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in fig.[f2 ] for @xmath141 mrad .    .5   and @xmath5 as well as the polarization degree as function of the x - ray energy .",
    "the observational angle is 5.6 mrad .",
    "the transversal electron momentum spread is zero ( top ) or not ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]    .5   and @xmath5 as well as the polarization degree as function of the x - ray energy .",
    "the observational angle is 5.6 mrad .",
    "the transversal electron momentum spread is zero ( top ) or not ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]    from fig.[f6 ] it is evident that the transversal electron momentum spread radically changes the x - ray polarization . in the top graph x - ray radiation",
    "is scattered only by the electrons with momentums parallel to the electron beam direction whereas in the bottom graph higher energy x - ray radiation is scattered mainly by electrons moving in the direction of observer .",
    "this makes the higher energy x - rays polarization in the bottom graph the same as for zero observational angle ( not shown ) whereas in the top graph its polarization remains rotated by about @xmath140 as for lower energy x - rays .",
    "in the this paper a working model for the calculation of polarization of x - ray radiation produced by a laser - electron x - ray generator is presented .",
    "it allows one to simulate the full polarization state of x - ray radiation for an arbitrary initial polarization state of laser beam .",
    "the model takes into account the transversal momentum spread of electron beam , which has significant influence over the final polarization state of x - ray radiation .",
    "the model has been implemented in a specially written program code in java programming language .    using a number of numerical experiments we demonstrated that the transversal momentum spread of electron beam causes partial depolarization of the scatted x - ray radiation .",
    "however for typical lexg parameters this depolarization was rather small  a few percent only . in addition , the orientation of the x - ray radiation polarization can change dramatically when the transversal electron moment spread is taken into account .",
    "the model of the x - ray radiation polarization of lexg presented in this work may be useful for evaluation of the lexg applications where polarization of the x - ray radiation is important .",
    "such applications include , for example , the study of surface characteristics of the materials by the x - ray ellipsometry @xcite and the polarization sensitive spectroscopy  for instance , investigation of x - ray magnetic circular dichroism near absorption edges in magnetic materials @xcite .",
