    "communication has been widely used to improve system robustness and capacity by allowing nodes to cooperate in their transmissions to form a virtual antenna array  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "several relay protocols have been studied for the wireless cooperative networks , and amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) are recognized as two basic cooperative transmission protocols .",
    "while using the af protocol , the relay node amplifies the received signal sent by the source , and then retransmits it to the destination without decoding . in contrast",
    ", the df protocol requires the relay node to decode the received signal and then forward the re - encoded signal to the destination .",
    "however , the performance of the af is mainly limited by the noise amplification phenomenon at the relay nodes and the df may cause serious error propagation problem when the relay fails to decode the received signal correctly@xcite .    motivated by the above - described disadvantages of the af and df protocols ,",
    "various improved cooperative transmission protocols have been proposed , such as signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) threshold - based selective digital relaying schemes@xcite , cooperative maximum ratio combining ( mrc)-based df@xcite and smart relaying scheme@xcite , log - likelihood - ratio  ( llr ) threshold - based selective df@xcite , decode - amplify - forward  ( daf)@xcite . a hybrid forward  ( hf ) protocol was proposed in @xcite , which provides superior performance than both the af and the df protocols and thus has received lots of attention recently . in @xcite , the author studied the symbol error rate  ( ser ) of the hf protocol by adaptively choosing the af and the df protocols on a per symbol basis , which is , however , hard to realise in practice .",
    "this work focuses on a more practical hf protocol on a per frame basis .    in conventional cooperative wireless networks",
    ", all @xmath0 relays will forward the signals received from the source to the destination through @xmath0 orthogonal channels in the relaying phase@xcite .",
    "then the destination combines all the signals received from the source and the relays using mrc technique . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that the all participate af  ( ap - af ) scheme can achieve the full diversity order of @xmath3",
    ". however , mrc , which combines the signals received from all the links in order to have the best possible combining gain , will certainly result in extremely complicated hardware implementation required for phase coherence and amplitude estimation on each link@xcite .",
    "furthermore , note that the links with low snrs may possibly lead to inefficient estimation on both phase and amplitude ; hence mrc is sensitive to the channel estimation errors@xcite . to simplify the hardware implementation and make the communication systems more robust towards channel estimation errors while still retaining good system performance , kong",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite first proposed the selection combining  ( sc ) scheme at the receiver , which combines @xmath1 links with the largest instantaneous snrs out of @xmath0 links , for a rake receiver operating over a multipath fading channel .",
    "as a result , the sc scheme has a fixed and low processing complexity since it only combines @xmath1 links , instead of all the @xmath0 links in the network@xcite .",
    "in addition , in the sc scheme , the weakest snr paths are excluded from the combining process to make the system more robust towards channel estimation errors .",
    "recently , the sc scheme was extended to the cooperative communication networks by selecting proper number of relay nodes to forward the signals to the destination for the source during the transmission phase . the work in @xcite and @xcite studies the ser performances of the sc with the af and the df protocols on a per symbol basis .",
    "note that the conventional cooperative scheme@xcite , in which all @xmath0 relays will forward the signals to the destination , can be viewed as a special case of the sc scheme when @xmath4 , and the conventional relay selection  ( rs ) scheme@xcite , in which only the relay that has the highest snrs at the destination is chosen as the active relay , is also a special case of the sc scheme when @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , the sc scheme is able to describe the cooperative networks in a unified and convenient manner , and provides insight into the system designs .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no results for the hf scheme with the sc have been reported in the literature so far .",
    "furthermore , most earlier works have been focusing on ser performance analysis and limited works for the analytical frame error rate  ( fer ) performance of the hf scheme , which is more frequently used in the evaluation of the system performance , have been presented .",
    "these motivated our work .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a two - hop network with one source node , one destination node and @xmath0 relay nodes , and with links experiencing independent block rayleigh fading .",
    "the main contributions of the present work can be briefly summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we propose and study the selective combining in hybrid cooperative networks  ( schcn scheme ) on a per frame basis .",
    "in the proposed schcns scheme , each relay adaptively chooses , frame by frame , between the af and df protocols by examining the error - detecting code results .",
    "specifically , we use cyclic redundancy check  ( crc ) codes for the af and df adaptation in this work .",
    "the relays , which decode correctly , will utilize the df protocol , and the rest will operate in the af mode .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath1 relays that have the highest effective snrs at the destination are chosen out of @xmath0 relays , and then retransmit their received signals to the destination .",
    "we develop an snr threshold - based fer approximation model and then establish the relationship between the outage probability and the fer by using a novel analytical snr threshold .",
    "3 .   using the proposed fer approximation model , a closed - form fer expression as well as a high snr asymptotic fer expression for the schcn scheme are derived .",
    "the derived fer expressions clearly indicate that the schcn scheme can achieve full diversity order .",
    "analytical results are verified through simulations .",
    "simulation results show that the best rs scheme outperforms the multiple rs scheme under a total transmit power constraint , whereas the multiple rs scheme provides better performance than the best rs scheme under an individual transmit power constraint .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe the system model and the schcn scheme in section [ sec : system_model ] . in section [ sec : fer_approx_model ] , we develop an snr threshold - based fer approximation model and derive an improved snr threshold . in section [ sec : fer_grs ] , we calculate the closed - form average fer and the simplified asymptotic fer expressions for the schcn scheme by using the fer approximation model . in section",

    "let @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the corresponding additive white gaussian noises ( awgns ) .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "finally , let @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the average transmit power at the source and the @xmath21th relay , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that each terminal in the network is in the half - duplex mode with single antenna .",
    "signals are transmitted over orthogonal channels , either through time or frequency division , in order to prevent interference .",
    "thus , one frame transmission in the relaying scheme consists of two separate phases , i.e. , the broadcasting  ( @xmath33st ) phase and the relaying  ( @xmath34nd ) phase .",
    "the source broadcasts a signal to both the @xmath0 relays and the destination in the broadcasting phase .",
    "the received signals at the destination and the @xmath21th relay , at time @xmath35 , denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , can be expressed as @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , where @xmath40 is the signal transmitted at the source .",
    "the corresponding instantaneous snrs are given as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , where @xmath43 .      during the relaying phase , each relay adaptively chooses , frame by frame , between the af and df protocols by examining the error - detecting code result .",
    "we use crc codes for the af and df adaptation in this paper .",
    "the relays which decode correctly , i.e. , the crc checking result is correct , are included in the df group , denoted by @xmath44 , and the rest are included in the af group , denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding received signal at the destination , denoted by @xmath46 can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents the signal transmitted from the @xmath21th relay .",
    "note that the transmit signal @xmath48 satisfies the following power constraint , @xmath49 .",
    "hence , the corresponding transmit signal @xmath48 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath50    therefore the instantaneous snr of the link through the @xmath21th relay node , denoted by @xmath51 , is given as @xcite@xmath52 where @xmath53 is the instantaneous snr of the link between the @xmath21th relay and the destination , which is given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "on receiving the signal sent from the source , each relay needs to send one bit indicator to inform the destination that it uses the af or df protocols . in the schcn scheme ,",
    "destination then calculates the overall received snr from each relay accordingly and selects the @xmath1 relays with the largest effective snrs . after finding the optimum @xmath1 relays , through a feedback channel ,",
    "the destination will inform which relays are selected for transmission during the relaying phrase and other unselected relays will be in an idle state .",
    "let @xmath56 represent the decreasing ordered snrs of the @xmath57 .",
    "then , the instantaneous snr of the mrc output at the destination is given by channels from the relay nodes and one channel from the source , and then selects the @xmath1 best relay nodes .",
    "thus the complexity of the pilot phase , is mainly dominated by the @xmath3 channel estimation process .",
    "the exact complexity is dependent on the channel estimation approach , for example , when using zero - forcing  ( zf ) to estimate the channel , one needs @xmath3 floating - point operations .",
    "furthermore , during the data transmission phase , the destination has to combine @xmath1 links from the relay nodes as well as the direct link from the source by using the mrc technique .",

    "it is assumed that all channel state information ( csi ) needed for decoding is available at the relay nodes and the destination node@xcite .",
    "this can be easily achieved in practice .",
    "for example , the relay acquires the csi of the source - relay channel via the pilot symbol sent from the source and then transmits it to the destination via a feedback channel .",
    "similarly , the destination can acquire the csi of the relay - destination via the pilot symbol sent from the relay . for simplicity ,",

    "in this section , an snr threshold - based fer approximation model is proposed for diversity systems .",

    "moreover , from fig . [",

    "however , the cooperative system with @xmath178 requires lower implementation complexity and is more robust towards channel estimation errors .",
