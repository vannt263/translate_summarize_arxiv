    "since the pioneering work of teitel and jayaprakash  @xcite , two dimensional ( 2d ) fully frustrated @xmath0 ( ff@xmath0 ) models have been intensively studied over the last decade , both analytically and numerically .  @xcite this model has a continuous @xmath1 symmetry associated with global spin rotations and also a discrete @xmath2 symmetry because of the double degeneracy of the ground state vortex configurations . at sufficiently low temperature @xmath3",
    "the system will be completely ordered with true long range order in the ising order parameter characterizing the vortex lattice and algebraic decay of correlations of the @xmath0 order parameter . as @xmath4 is increased , the system will disorder by one of two possible scenarios .",
    "one is the simultaneous loss of both @xmath0 and ising order and the other is a two stage process in which @xmath0 order is destroyed at a lower temperature than the ising order . since the original paper on this model ,  @xcite an enormous effort has gone into trying to clarify the nature of the phase transition(s ) of this model and several related models believed to be in the same universality class have been studied numerically .",
    "@xcite however , the nature of the transition(s ) in the ff@xmath0 model and its generalizations is still somewhat controversial .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the coulomb gas with half integer charges  @xcite generally show a vortex lattice melting transition and a kt - like transition at slightly different temperatures which is consistent with the second scenario .",
    "however , the melting transition is expected to be in the ising universality class but the simulations yield exponents which are inconsistent with the ising values . moreover , at the kt - like transition the discontinuity in the helicity modulus is much larger than the universal value of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "yet another model is the coupled @xmath0-ising model  @xcite which is a coarse - grained version of the ff@xmath0 model .",
    "it was suggested that this model displayed both possible scenarios depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "recent studies  @xcite of the ff@xmath0 model with a nearest neighbor cosine interaction show that the disordering is by the second scenario with a kt transition followed by an ising transition at a slightly higher temperature . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the ff@xmath0 model may have separate @xmath0 and ising transitions if the critical exponents of the vortex lattice melting are consistent with the 2d ising values and the jump in the helicity modulus at the @xmath0 transition has the universal value of @xmath5 but most numerical studies are not consistent with these .",
    "however , in his recent numerical study , olsson  @xcite pointed out that , for conventional finite size scaling to hold , it is essential that the system size @xmath6 is much larger than any other length scale .",
    "since the vortex lattice melting temperature @xmath7 is only slightly larger than @xmath8 , the relevant length is @xmath9 , the @xmath0 correlation length at the lattice melting temperature .",
    "as is well known , this remains rather large quite far above @xmath8 and , by taking this into account , a good fit to the double transition scenario was obtained  @xcite with a conventional kt transition followed by an ising transition .",
    "whatever the precise nature of the transitions in any model , an essential first step is to determine whether the system has two separate transitions or a single transition .",
    "it is of some interest from the point of view of conformal field theories to find a non - trivial model in which the central charge @xmath10 .",
    "recently , a related class of models for transitions on crystal surfaces with competing reconstruction ( ising ) and roughening ( @xmath0 ) degrees of freedom has been studied  @xcite .",
    "den nijs has studied competition between surface roughening and reconstruction and tentatively concluded that the roughening and deconstruction transition lines meet and finally merge together into a single roughening induced simultaneous reconstruction transition line .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , carlon in a recent study of the staggered six vertex model ,  @xcite has suggested that the two transition lines never merge but become very close to each other which is strong evidence for two separate transition in the ff@xmath0 model . in order to clarify whether the ising and @xmath0 transition lines merge we introduce the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model coupled to the ising model .",
    "this rsos - ising model can be derived from the @xmath0-ising model by making a duality transformation on the @xmath0 degrees of freedom which introduces integer height variables on the dual lattice .",
    "the resulting rsos - ising model has both ising and height ( @xmath0 ) degrees of freedom and , for this reason , can be considered to have the same features as the staggered six vertex model and reconstructed surface models .",
    "we investigate the rsos - ising system by a rejection free microcanonical mc technique  @xcite which is appropriate to this system and also highly accurate .",
    "we have obtained an accurate phase diagram in a two parameter space and some critical exponents . as a result",
    "we have found there are ising and roughening critical lines which never merge in all parameter space .",
    "this result is strong evidence against the single transition scenario in the fully frustrated @xmath0 model .    in the following section we give a derivation of the rsos - ising model from the coupled @xmath0-ising system . in section",
    "iii we present a brief explanation of the mc procedure  @xcite as adapted for this system , methods of data analysis and mc results .",
    "finally we present our conclusions .",
    "from renormalization group and universality arguments the isotropic ff@xmath0 model can be described by a coupled @xmath0-ising model of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the phase of the continuous spin at @xmath13th site and @xmath14 describes the chirality .",

    "this model has been intensively studied by lee _",
    "_  @xcite by studying the behavior of the chiral ( ising ) degrees of freedom @xmath17 , they found a line of continuous transitions with a segment of non - ising like critical exponents , in particular @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "based on this , they argued that the ising and @xmath0 critical lines must have merged into a single line of simultaneous ordering of both degrees of freedom .",
    "however , they made no explicit study of the @xmath0 degree of freedom for technical reasons , which weakens their argument . to simultaneously study the @xmath0 and ising critical lines",

    "if the walker is initially at a configuration belonging to the innermost square , all allowed moves are acceptable . on the other hand ,",

    "if the selected move is forbidden we discard the move but count the current configuration once more and sample again for the same configuration to satisfy the condition of detailed balance .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to assigning the correct weight to the sampling configurations .",
    "when the walker is at a configuration not belonging to the innermost four energy values , we make a random selection of trial move from the group of acceptable moves only and let the walker move to a new configuration without wasting computing time .",
    "this is possible since we are not taking data at this configuration . in this way we can estimate the number of visits for the innermost four energy configurations , which give relative ratios @xmath99 and @xmath100 for all @xmath13 and @xmath101 .",
    "the sampled data for @xmath80 will furnish microcanonical averages @xmath79 .",
    "since the exact number of configurations @xmath78 for small values of @xmath81 and @xmath77 are easily computed , we can recursively estimate all @xmath78 s from these . to obtain more accurate data we use a two - step mc simulation .",

    "the microcanonical average @xmath105 is also estimated directly from data taken during this mc process . to check the validity of our procedure",
    "we compare the estimated @xmath106 and @xmath107 for all system sizes with those of the pure rsos model and those of the pure ising model respectively .",
    "we calculated the number of configurations for the pure rsos model independently and the those of the pure ising model are well known  @xcite .",
    "both of them agree well with each other to within expected statistical deviations .",
    "the canonical average of any thermodynamic quantity @xmath80 is obtained by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the ising magnetization , @xmath110 is a rsos magnetization to be defined in eq.([eq.14 ] ) below and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the microcanonical values of the thermodynamic quantity @xmath80 and the number of configurations for given @xmath113 , respectively . in eq.([eq.12 ] ) , the exponent of the boltzmann weight factor does not involve any magnetization .",

    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "as the specific heat of the 2d @xmath0 model has no diverging peak as @xmath127 , the rsos part of the specific heat may also not diverge which implies the transition temperature may not be easy to determine accurately . for the 2d @xmath0 model , which has vanishing magnetization in the bulk limit for any finite temperature , the helicity modulus , or stiffness constant which is a measure of the quasi long - range order of the order parameter describing the continuous @xmath1 symmetry and the superfluid density of a bose superfluid  @xcite ,",

    "it is easily seen from the figures that there are three different phases depending on the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath63 : ising ordered rough ( ior ) , ising ordered flat ( iof ) and ising disordered flat ( dof ) .",
    "the ior and dof phases are separated by the iof phase in the low temperature region though it is not clear whether , in the region of small @xmath61 and @xmath63 , the two phases are also separated or not .",
    "the corresponding phases of the @xmath0-ising model of eq.([0 ] ) are @xmath0 and ising order ( ior ) , @xmath0 disorder and ising order ( iof ) and @xmath0 and ising disorder ( dof ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fourth phase of @xmath0 order and ising disorder , corresponding to an ising disordered rough phase of the rsos - ising model , does not exist .",
    "we now examine the behavior of the specific heat .",
    "for simplicity , we consider @xmath134 and @xmath135 corresponding to the rsos and ising specific heats , respectively .",

    "in fact the estimated @xmath172 along the roughening transition line in that region decreases slightly as the system size increases .",
    "this means that the estimated transition line actually lies in the flat region close to the real roughening transition line which will lie to the left of our estimated line .",
    "we have located a more reasonable roughening transition line in that region using the criterion @xmath176 and find that the transition line shifts to the left about @xmath177 in @xmath61 .",
    "this is consistent with our arguments that the true @xmath146 is smaller than the value estimated on the assumption that @xmath157 at the roughening transition and that the two transitions are separated by a thin tongue of iof phase .",

    "the rsos - ising model is believed to undergo continuous phase transitions in the same universality classes as the ff@xmath0 system .",
    "we believe that the restriction on the heights @xmath178 is not a serious one in that it will not affect the universality class of the transitions provided they are continuous and that the topology of the phase diagram is also not qualitatively affected .",
    "we believe that the only possible difference lifting the rsos restriction on the heights could have would be to allow the ising and roughening lines to merge into a segment of first order transition line separating the dof and ior phases . in our numerical study of the rsos - ising system we identified three phases :",
    "ising ordered rough ( ior ) , ising ordered flat ( iof ) and ising disordered flat ( dof ) which correspond to @xmath0 and ising ordered , @xmath0 disorder and ising order and complete disorder respectively . using the rejection free microcanonical method",
    ", we obtain a precise phase diagram and demonstrate that the ior and dof phases are separated by a sliver of iof phase for all physical values of the parameters . as the temperature in the ff@xmath0 model is raised , the system will follow some path in the @xmath179 plane from the ior phase to the dof phase . since it must pass through the intervening iof phase , this is strong evidence that there are two continuous transitions in the ff@xmath0 and @xmath0-ising models .",
    "the critical exponents along the ising transition line seem to change continuously in the region where the ising and roughening transitions are close together but this may be due to large corrections to scaling caused by the nearby roughening transition . in that case the correct determination of the critical behavior will require very large systems . since we have located the precise phase transition lines the true critical behavior along the ising line may be determined using other mc methods appropriate for the very large systems needed .",
    "we leave this for future study .",
