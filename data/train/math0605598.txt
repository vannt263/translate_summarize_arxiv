    "we will then show an unexpected connection between these line arrangements and an important and ubiquitous family of subdivisions of polytopes : the triangulations of the product of simplices @xmath4 .",
    "these triangulations appear naturally in studying the geometry of the product of all minors of a matrix @xcite , tropical geometry @xcite , and transportation problems @xcite .",
    "to finish , we will illustrate some of the consequences that the combinatorics of these line arrangements have on the schubert calculus of the flag manifold .",
    "the results of the paper are roughly divided into four parts as follows .",
    "first of all , section [ section : h_mn ] is devoted to studying the line arrangement determined by the intersections of a generic arrangement of hyperplanes .",
    "this will serve as a warmup before we investigate generic arrangements of complete flags , and the results we obtain will be useful in that investigation .",
    "the second part consists of sections [ section : flags.to.simplex ] , [ section : t_nd ] and [ section : t_nd.is.right ] , where we will characterize the line arrangements that arise as intersections of a  matroid - generic \" arrangement of @xmath0 flags in @xmath1 .",
    "section [ section : flags.to.simplex ] is a short discussion of the combinatorial setup that we will use to encode these geometric objects . in section [ section : t_nd ] , we propose a combinatorial definition of a matroid @xmath2 . in section [ section : t_nd.is.right ] we will show that @xmath2 is the matroid of the line arrangement of any @xmath0 flags in @xmath1 which are generic enough .",
    "finally , we show that these line arrangements are completely characterized combinatorially : any line arrangement in @xmath1 whose matroid is @xmath2 arises as an intersection of @xmath0 flags .",
    "the third part establishes a surprising connection between these line arrangements and an important class of subdivisions of polytopes .",
    "the bases of @xmath3 exactly describe the ways of punching @xmath12 triangular holes into the equilateral triangle of size @xmath12 , so that the resulting holey triangle can be tiled with unit rhombi .",
    "a consequence of this is a very explicit geometric representation of @xmath3 .",
    "we show these results in section [ section : rhombus.tilings ] .",
    "we then pursue a higher - dimensional generalization of this result . in section [ section : fine.mixed.subdivisions ] , we suggest that the fine mixed subdivisions of the minkowski sum @xmath13 are an adequate @xmath14-dimensional generalization of the rhombus tilings of holey triangles .",
    "we give a completely combinatorial description of these subdivisions .",
    "finally , in section [ section : triangulations.matroid ] , we prove that each pure mixed subdivision of the minkowski sum @xmath15 ( or equivalently , each triangulation of the product of simplices @xmath16 ) gives rise to a basis of @xmath2 .",
    "we conjecture that every basis of @xmath2 arises in this way .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that every basis of @xmath2 arises from a _ regular _ subdivision or , equivalently , from an arrangement of @xmath0 tropical hyperplanes in tropical @xmath5-space .",
    "the fourth and last part of the paper , section [ section : schubert ] , presents some of the consequences of our work in the schubert calculus of the flag manifold .",
    "we start by recalling eriksson and linusson s permutation arrays , and billey and vakil s related method for explicitly intersecting schubert varieties . in section [",
    "subsection : genericity ] we show how the geometric representation of the matroid @xmath3 of section [ section : rhombus.tilings ] gives us a new perspective on billey and vakil s method for computing the structure constants @xmath17 of the cohomology ring of the flag variety . finally , section [ subsection : schubert.zero ] presents a simple and effective criterion for guaranteeing that many schubert structure constants are equal to zero .",
    "we conclude with some future directions of research that are suggested by this project .",
    "before thinking about flags , let us start by studying the slightly easier problem of understanding the matroid of lines of a generic arrangement of @xmath18 hyperplanes in @xmath1 .",

    "second , and more important to us , it shows that even five generic hyperplanes in @xmath39 give rise to interesting geometric configurations .",

    "following the algorithm of @xcite , the permutations @xmath549 in @xmath550 give rise to the four - dimensional permutation array consisting of the dots @xmath551 , @xmath552 , @xmath553 , @xmath554 , @xmath555 , @xmath556 , @xmath557 , @xmath558 , @xmath559 , and @xmath560 .",
    "we follow @xcite in representing it as follows :    @xmath561    the three boards shown represent the three - dimensional floors @xmath562 and @xmath563 of @xmath338 , form left to right . in each one of them , a dot in cell @xmath564 is represented in two dimensions by a number @xmath100 in cell @xmath490 .",
    "it takes some practice to interpret these tables ; but once one is used to them , it is very easy to proceed .",
    "simply notice that @xmath565 is a set of rank @xmath141 in the matroid @xmath323 , while @xmath566 has rank @xmath265 as a permutation array , and we are done !",
    "we conclude that @xmath567 . for @xmath568 ,",
    "this is the only vanishing @xmath17 which is not explained by proposition [ prop : vanishing.billey.vakil ] . in this example ,",
    "the vanishing of @xmath17 can also be seen by comparing the leading terms of the corresponding schubert polynomials .    for a larger example , let @xmath569 .",
    "notice that @xmath570 .",
    "the permutation array we obtain is    @xmath571    here @xmath572 has rank @xmath573 in @xmath574 , implying that @xmath575    knutson @xcite , lascoux and schutzenberger @xcite , and purbhoo @xcite have developed other methods for detecting the vanishing of schubert structure constants . in comparing these methods for small values of @xmath12 , we have found proposition [ prop : vanishing ] to be quicker and simpler to observe , but we have not been able to verify our technique as far as purbhoo .",
    "here is an example where our method allows us to `` observe '' a zero coefficient that knutson ( * ? ?",
    "* fact 2.4 ) claims does not follow from his technique of descent cycling .",
    "let @xmath576 , @xmath577 , @xmath578 , then the unique permutation array determined by these three permutations is :    @xmath579    by theorems  [ thm : matroid ] and  [ thm : genericflags ] , an independent set on the rank 6 board is determined by the circled points @xmath580 in the rank 4 board , we have the points @xmath581 from this basis along with @xmath582 which span a two dimensional space in the span of @xmath583 .",
    "therefore , the 4 dimensional board can not be satisfied by vectors in a space of dimension less than 5 . hence @xmath584 .",
