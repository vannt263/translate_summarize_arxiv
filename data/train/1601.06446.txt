    "epitaxial growth of a high quality , large area single- and multi - layer graphene sheets on a transition - metal substrates is presently in the focus of the research efforts worldwide , as has been discussed in several review articles @xcite .",
    "strategies were developed to grow the graphene sheets with the area of up to 1 @xmath0 using the chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) of a hydrocarbons ( such as methane , ch@xmath1 ) on copper , an abundant and inexpensive substrate @xcite . alongside the experimental efforts , modeling of the cvd graphene growth on cu was also attempted .",
    "these studies can be divided into three groups : _ ab initio _ and kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) methods @xcite , rate equations @xcite , and phase - field methods @xcite . by assuming the anisotropic diffusion on cu of the carbon atoms and their anisotropic attachment to the islands",
    ", the authors of the latter reference succeeded in computing the growth of the multi - lobe graphene islands on the substrates of different crystallographic orientations .",
    "however , with the focus of the study on the morphologies , the kinetic maps of the growth rate dependence on the controllable process parameters , such as the pressure and temperature , were not computed . in this paper",
    "we describe a simpler , one - dimensional pde model , whose purpose is to compute the growth rate of a single graphene island as a function of three control parameters : the crystallographic orientation of the substrate , the growth temperature , and the pressure of a gas of the carbon atoms that impinge on the substrate . in the manner of ref .",
    "@xcite , we abstract from the details of the dissociation of a hydrocarbons , assuming that it results in the carbon gas from which the carbon atoms are adsorbed on cu surface . however , we recognize , as is pointed out in the _ ab initio _ studies , that besides the carbon atoms there is other diffusing species that may contribute to the island growth @xcite - of which the carbon dimers are thought to be the most important @xcite .",
    "our hybrid model can be seen as an extension , directly informed by the activation energies from the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , of the classical bcf - type modeling @xcite to two interacting and diffusing species that feed growth of the graphene island edge .",
    "this results in a coupled pde problem for the concentration fields on the substrate .",
    "both pdes are also coupled , through the boundary conditions , to an ode for the position of the island edge .",
    "as we pointed out in the introduction , the model is aimed at computing the velocity , @xmath2 , of a growing edge of a single - layer graphene island . here",
    "@xmath3 is the position of the edge , see fig .",
    "[ geom ] .",
    "since the edge grows predominantly by attachment of the carbon atoms and dimers @xcite , let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the concentrations of the carbon atoms adsorbed on cu and the carbon dimers , respectively .",
    "the latter result from the assembly of two previously adsorbed carbon atoms .",
    "the model is comprised of the following pdes and boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "* evolution equation for the concentration @xmath6 on the section of the copper substrate that is not yet covered by the growing graphene island : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the carbon atoms diffusivity , @xmath9 the adsorption flux , and the sink term @xmath10 describes the loss of the carbon atoms due to their assembly into the dimers ; the kinetics of this loss is reciprocal in @xmath11 , e.g. @xmath12 , as follows from the ode @xmath13 .",
    "we found that it is not necessary to include atoms desorption in eq .",
    "( [ c_eq ] ) , particularly since the desorption rate has not been published and because even without the desorption the concentration is quite small ( fig .",
    "[ concentrations ] ) .",
    "( [ c_eq ] ) is a well - posed nonlinear pde with a unique solution for all @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "+ the boundary conditions for @xmath6 are : @xmath15 the first boundary condition states that far from the graphene island ( at the center of the substrate ) the carbon concentration profile is symmetric .",
    "the second one states that at the growing edge the flux of the carbon atoms is proportional to the difference between the concentration there and the equilibrium concentration @xcite ; the proportionality parameter @xmath16 is the kinetic coefficient , which gives a measure of the ease with which the carbon atoms can attach to the edge .",
    "* evolution equation for the concentration @xmath17 , also on the section of the substrate not yet covered by the growing graphene island : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the diffusivity of the carbon dimers , @xmath20 their desorption rate , and the source term @xmath21 is due to assembly of the carbon atoms into dimers .",
    "notice that through this term the linear eq .",
    "( [ c_2_eq ] ) is one - way coupled to eq .",
    "( [ c_eq ] ) .",
    "+ the boundary conditions for @xmath17 mirror those for @xmath6 : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the attachment coefficient of the dimers and @xmath24 the equilibrium concentration for the growth by the dimers attachment .",
    "* equation of the edge growth : @xmath25 - \\label{x0_eq } \\\\ & & 2\\omega k_{c2}\\left[c_2(x_0(t),t ) - c_{eq2}\\right],\\ ; x_0(0)=0 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation states that the edge velocity is the sum of the contributions resulting from the attachment of the atoms and dimers , where each contribution is proportional to the deviation at the edge of the corresponding concentration from its equilibrium value @xcite .",

    "zero initial condition for @xmath17 is taken , e.g. at @xmath42 there is no dimers on the substrate .",
    "apart from the multiple parameters , the system ( [ c_eq_a])-([bc2a ] ) looks deceptively simple .",
    "however , this is the moving - boundary problem , since the position @xmath3 of the graphene edge is _ a priori _ unknown and must be found alongside with the concentrations . due to a moving edge",
    ", any change in the concentrations gradients near the edge affects the edge growth speed , and the change in speed in turn affects the concentrations near the edge and beyond . after focusing on the physical parameters in the next section , in section [ nummeth ] the procedure for the numerical solution of this system of equations is described .",

    "values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 were not published for graphene growth on copper .",
    "thus in the table 1 we adopt the generic values for @xmath48 and @xmath47 @xcite , and for @xmath49 we adopt a value that partially curtails the otherwise unlimited growth of the dimers concentration ( caused by the perpetual assembly of the carbon atoms into dimers ) , allowing the computation to proceed until the edge grows over the entire available substrate . this value is large , thus the desorption flux is small .",
    "carbon gas pressure @xmath50 is varied in the range 100@xmath51600 mtorr , @xmath52 g is the molecular weight of carbon , the temperature @xmath53 is in the interval 873@xmath511273 k , and the half - width of the substrate @xmath54 mm .",

    "next , the final transformed system is discretized in @xmath70 using the second - order finite differences with the fixed grid spacings @xmath44 and @xmath71 , and two ode systems resulting from such discretizations are solved independently and in parallel using the same initial condition .",
    "richardson interpolation is performed after a fixed number of time steps . this way a spatially fourth - order accurate solution is obtained on a coarse grid .",
    "this solution is then interpolated onto a fine grid before the next step is taken .",
    "the temporal accuracy is achieved automatically by an ode solver .",
    "the grid refinement study was performed , which indicated that using @xmath72 results in the needed overall computational accuracy for all parameters values of interest .",
    "we begin this section with the comparisons of figures [ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t ] and [ speed_vs_p0 ] , computed for graphene growth on cu[111 ] surface , with the corresponding figures [ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t_[100 ] ] and [ speed_vs_p0_[100 ] ] for the growth on cu[100 ] surface .    in figures [ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t](a ) and",
    "[ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t_[100]](a ) it can be seen that the growth slows down as the temperature increases , which perhaps explains better graphene quality and larger islands at higher growth temperatures @xcite . from the insets to these figures , it appears that the slow - down is logarithmic .",
    "this is a new and important model prediction , as the quantitative experimental results on the growth speed scaling with the temperature have not been published . at each temperature",
    "the speed is nearly a constant value for the entire duration of the simulation ( changing less than 1% , see figures [ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t](b ) and [ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t_[100]](b ) ) .",
    "also we noticed that the speed is smaller on cu[100 ] and it slowly and monotonically decreases with time on this surface , while on cu[111 ] surface the curve is s - shaped ; the latter dynamics is somewhat similar to the one shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "attachment of the dimers provides the major contribution to the growth speed ( see the insets ) . in the case of growth on cu[111 ] , the contribution from the dimers exceeds by a factor of five the one from the atoms ; on cu[100 ] , the atoms provide a negligible contribution .",
    "this supports the recent conclusions in the _ ab initio _ @xcite and experimental papers @xcite that the graphene edge grows primarily by the dimers attachment",
    ".     surface .",
    "( a ) edge speed , @xmath73 , vs. the time at @xmath74 mtorr and various temperatures .",

    "inset shows the mean edge speed vs. the temperature ( that was first mapped onto the unit interval ) , where the mean is calculated over the time interval from zero to @xmath75 for each curve ; the line is the logarithmic fit to the data shown by squares .",

    ", width=312 ]      figures [ speed_vs_p0 ] and [ speed_vs_p0_[100 ] ] show the dependencies of the edge speed on the time and pressure at a fixed temperature .",
    "the speed increases linearly with @xmath50 .",
    "this is another key model prediction that remains to be supported by the experiment ; the quantitative experimental data were not published .",
    "we remark here that the computed growth speeds shown in figures [ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t ] - [ speed_vs_p0_[100 ] ] exceed by a few orders of magnitude the speeds that are reported in the experimental papers .",
    "values from the experiments seem to be of the order @xmath79 @xmath80s for the temperature range that we use in the computations .",
    "we conjecture that the discrepancies are primarily due to the larger @xmath50 values used in our computations than the carbon partial pressures in the experiments , as well as because the adopted @xmath81 value is approximate .",
    "since the pressures of the hydrocarbons or the evaporated carbon are not consistently reported in the experimental literature , we took for @xmath50 the set of  growth pressure \" ( or  chamber pressure \" ) values from ref .",
    "@xcite . from the inset of fig .",
    "[ speed_vs_p0 ] one can see that the speed of the order @xmath82 @xmath80s would result when the fit is extrapolated to @xmath83 mtorr ( for cu[111 ] surface , see fig .",
    "[ speed_vs_p0_[100 ] ] , this value is 21 mtorr ) .",
    "these extrapolated values are order - of - magnitude consistent with those reported in refs . @xcite in conjunction with the growth rates of the orders that we stated above .",
    "it is common in the experiments to employ thermal cycles during growth or sharply decrease the temperature at the very end of the growth phase .",
    "this typically results in better quality of the graphene layer , also its area is enlarged @xcite .",
    "why this happens is not well understood @xcite .",
    "our model is well - suited for giving some insights into this situation .",
    "we started the computation using the parameters at 1273 k and computed for some time , then instantaneously switched to the parameters at 973 k and computed more , and finally switched back to the parameters at 1273 k and computed until the substrate overgrowth by a graphene sheet was completed . in fig .",
    "[ speed_vs_t_t=1273ktot=973ktot=1273k_[111 ] ] we show the growth speed , and in fig . [ concentrations_t=1273ktot=973ktot=1273k_[111 ] ] , the concentrations profiles .",
    "first , we notice that the growth speed is fully reversible , e.g. after the temperature is quenched from 973 k to 1273 k the speed returns to its value prior to the cool - down .",
    "what is remarkable is the large factor ( @xmath84 ) by which the speed increases ( decreases ) when the temperature is decreased ( increased ) .",
    "this value can be directly compared to fig .",
    "[ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t ] , which is computed at the same @xmath50 and at a _ constant _ temperature throughout the entire growth phase . there",
    ", the factor by which the speed changes is 7.5 when the temperature is dropped from 1273 k to 973 k. clearly , quenching the temperature down and then up during growth results in a large net increase of the growth speed ( notice that the growth is completed in 1.6 s in fig .",
    "[ speed_vs_t_t=1273ktot=973ktot=1273k_[111 ] ] and in 5 s in fig . [ speed_vs_t_and_speed_vs_t ] ) .",
    "closer examination shows that this increase is attributed nearly entirely to the dimers ; their concentration experiences a way more abrupt change ( compared to the concentration of the atoms ) when the temperature is quenched up / down .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ concentrations_t=1273ktot=973ktot=1273k_[111 ] ] , where the concentrations are plotted before the cool - down , after the cool - down , and after the warm - up",

    "width=312 ]    it was determined @xcite that the growth slows down with time , the more so the closer the graphene islands approach each other @xcite . in the cited papers the cu crystallographic surface is not identified though , it is only stated that the growth is realized on a cu foil .",
    "also , since the observations are made when there is several growing islands , as is always the case , the growth slowdown may not occur were it was possible to grow a single island . in our modeling , the minor decrease of the growth speed",
    "is seen for cu[100 ] surface , but not for cu[111 ] surface .",
    "however , it will be fairly straightforward to incorporate another growing island into the model , which may allow to more precisely differentiate between the growth modes on these cu surfaces . for better predictive capability",
