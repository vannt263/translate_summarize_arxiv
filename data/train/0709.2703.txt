    "for example , it has been noted that initially entangled two - qubit systems can suffer `` entanglement sudden death , '' in which a two - qubit system may suddenly lose entanglement in a finite time , even though each qubit itself maintains its quantum - coherence@xcite . here , we present the first general analysis of the disentanglement and dephasing of two qutrits as realized in atoms with `` v''-type energy - level configuration under a classical pure dephasing noise model , at the multi - local and collective level .",

    "this result is the most general yet to be obtained in the comparative study of decoherence and disentanglement in two - qutrit systems .",

    "it is therefore illuminating to characterize its behavior for each of the dephasing cases : no dephasing , one - qutrit local dephasing , and two - qutrit multi - local dephasing . in the expression for negativity",
    ", we can isolate the behavior of one local dephasing channel with respect to the other by setting the decay factors corresponding to the other channel to one , effectively freezing that factor to time zero .",

    "one then notes that in all these cases decoherence never proceeds faster than disentanglement , as we previously found to be the case for qubit pairs @xcite .",
    "in later sections , when examining specific classes of states , we compare decoherence and disentanglement more explicitly .",
    "when subjected to collective dephasing noise , the time - evolved density matrix of the two - qutrit system in general case is given by @xmath73 note the form of the matrix , in which there are regions unaffected by dephasing , with decoherence effects along the edges .",
    "we show in the next section that this gives rise to a class of states that can exist in these decoherence free subspaces , where entanglement is also be explicitly characterized .",
    "we see in the above general matrix that there exist two timescales of off - diagonal element decay , @xmath74    the reduced density matrices are given by the following matrices , @xmath75 note that the single - qutrit reduced density matrices do not become entirely diagonal .",
    "the reason , as we stated above , is the existence of decoherence free subspaces . in this case , there exists only one timescale in which a subset of off - diagonal elements decay , @xmath76    the expression for negativity for the general class under the collective dephasing channel , is similar in character to the negativity found in the previous subsection for the multi - local dephasing channel given by eq .",
    "5 . therefore ,",
    "for clarity , we defer our discussion of the behavior of the negativity in the case of the collective dephasing channel until after treating specific states to the next section .",
    "in order better to distinguish decoherence and disentanglement behavior , let us now turn our attention to two specific classes of states . in the standard - basis representation , the generic pure state of a two - qutrit system is @xmath77 , a normalized state vector with @xmath78 .",
    "the generic class of two - qutrit pure states represented by @xmath79 contains two subclasses of interest , distinguished by their coherence behavior in large timescales under collective dephasing noise , that is , dephasing in which each qutrit interacts with the same collective noise @xmath80 .",
    "one class is seen to be _ fragile _ , whereas the other is _ robust_. + ( i ) the _ fragile _ class @xmath81 , in which @xmath82 may be non - zero and all other terms @xmath83 , has the forms @xmath84 ( ii ) the _ robust _ class @xmath85 , in which all @xmath86 listed may be non - zero and @xmath87 , has the forms @xmath88 the specific forms of the two classes above constitute bell - like states in the hilbert space of our two - qutrit system , similarly to the qubit - pair - state classification given in @xcite .",
    "the initial density matrix representing the two - qutrit fragile class is given by @xmath89 where the dots denote the remainder of the density matrix , which is filled out by zero entries .",
    "let us turn our attention to the behavior of this state when subjected to the multi - local dephasing @xmath47 acting on qutrits a and b. recall that the multi - local dephasing channel captures the features of each of the local dephasing channels fully , so for this analysis , we consider the multi - local dephasing channel only , which provides information about each of the individual dephasing channels if one simply turns off one of the channels .",
    "the density matrix subjected to noise is @xmath90 which has two different decoherence times of @xmath91 by comparison , the disentanglement timescales deriving from the negativity , @xmath92 are @xmath93 .",
    "the reduced density matrices of qutrit a and b are @xmath94 we see that they are both initially fully mixed , so that no further decoherence is possible .        the two - qutrit density matrix , as given by @xmath96 decays according to a single timescale , @xmath97 .",
    "the disentanglement , characterized via the negativity , @xmath98 disentanglement proceeds at only a single timescale , @xmath99 .",
    "the single qutrit matrices are always @xmath100 again , we see that the single qutrit states are both fully mixed , so that no further decoherence is possible . comparing timescales",
    ", we see that decoherence never proceeds faster than disentanglement : @xmath101      the two - qutrit density matrix for the robust class , under the multi - local dephasing channel , is given by @xmath102 the rows and columns of zeros in this matrix are exactly the rows and columns that are affected by the collective dephasing channel , giving rise to the robust character of this density matrix .",
    "for analysis in this section , we consider , without loss of generality , the first form of this class @xmath103 , which allows the decoherence and disentanglement timescales to be seen clearly .",
    "if we were to include the entire subclass , we would have the same behavior as our forthcoming analysis .",
    "the time - evolved density matrix for the multi - local dephasing channel acting on @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 we see that the off - diagonal elements decay according to the timescale @xmath106 .",

    "disentanglement proceeds at the same single timescale , @xmath108 .",
    "the reduced density matrices are given by @xmath109 always fully decohered as in the case of the fragile states .",
    "again , we see that decoherence never proceeds faster than disentanglement , so that clearly the inequality @xmath110 is satisfied .      here , @xmath111 as defined above in eq .",
    "[ robusttimezero ] . and",
    "the state neither decoheres nor disentangles : the off - diagonal elements remain unreduced and the negativity remains at the maximum value of 1 for all times .",
    "these states are robust against collective dephasing noise .",
    "we have shown for this model of two - qutrit systems under the chosen basis - specific dephasing noise , whether local , multi - local or collective in nature , that disentanglement proceeds at least as fast as decoherence .",
    "this result accords with previous studies of similar nature for qubit systems .",
    "because the case of two - dimensions in quantum mechanics is often a special one in quantum mechanics , for example , in the cases of the foundational theorems of gleason and kochen and specker , it is always important to examine cases beyond that of qubits for the possibility of different behavior from that exhibited in the special case of qubits .",
    "our results suggest that the relation between basis - dependent dephasing decoherence and disentanglement found here can be expected to hold for pairs of initially entangled qu-@xmath112-it systems under analogous dephasing noise for general values of @xmath112 .",
    "it remains an open question whether or not this phenomenon can be generalized to an arbitrary _ multi - partite _ quantum systems , each of arbitrary dimension , however , not least of all because good entanglement measures for mixed states of such systems is lacking ."
