    "the two most popular routes to estimating the hubble costant h@xmath5 involve the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the supernovae type ia ( sne  ia ) . the wmap experiment @xcite measures a precise time since recombination , and makes a strong case for a flat universe . however , this measurement of the local expansion rate relies on the adopted cosmological model and on the priors ( list of cosmological parameters ) adopted in dealing with the cmb map .",
    "the sne  ia provide an independent estimate of h@xmath5 .",
    "the absolute calibration of the sne  ia luminosity peak is currently anchored to the cepheid - based distances to a dozen nearby host galaxies , and for this reason cepheids are the cornerstone for the absolute calibration of the extragalactic distance scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the universality of the cepheid pl relation , and the possibility that the slope and/or the zero - point of the pl relation might depend on the chemical composition , have been lively debated for almost two decades ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with controversial results .",
    "no general consensus has been reached so far .",
    "the consequence of this uncertainty is that the most recent estimates of h@xmath5 , in spite of their very small formal accuracy ( @xmath3 3% ) , might still be affected by systematic uncertainties of the order of 10% . to prove this statement",
    ", we emphasize that the values presented in this volume range from 62 to 74 km / s mpc .",
    "the above scenario can be summarized quoting @xcite : `` ... the universality of the pl relation is an only historically justified illusion . ''    in this paper , we will discuss an on - going project devoted to the understanding of the nature of ulp cepheids and their usefullness as stellar candles . in the next future , this possible new class of distance indicators will allow us to directly reach distances of cosmological interest , representing both an important alternative to sne ia and a better calibrator than classical cepheids of this important secondary distance indicator as well as of other indicators .",
    "the reason of our interest in these stars is their intrinsic luminosity , which is 2 - 4 magnitudes brighter than typical classical cepheids used so far to set the extragalactic distance ladder .",
    "then , they allow us to extend the current observational limit ( ngc  1309 is the farthest galaxy with identified classical cepheids and it is located at 33  mpc , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) up to 100  mpc .",
    "furthermore , the esa astrometric satellite gaia will provide trigonometric parallaxes at micro - arcsec accuracy , hence precise direct distances of the lmc and smc ulp cepheids . and",

    "the most important are : _",

    "we have qualitatively investigated the metallicity dependence of the wesenheit index derived from the v and i bands .",
    "we do not find a significant metallicity dependence in good agreement with the theoretical modelling of classical cepheids @xcite .",
    "thus , the metallicity differences do not seem to be the cause of the spread around the wp relationship",

    "<S> the cosmological distance ladder crucially depends on classical cepheids ( with p=3 - 80  days ) , which are primary distance indicators up to 33  mpc . within this volume , very few sne  ia </S>",
    "<S> have been calibrated through classical cepheids , with uncertainty related to the non - linearity and the metallicity dependence of their period@xmath0luminosity ( pl ) relation . </S>",
    "<S> although a general consensus on these effects is still not achieved , classical cepheids remain the most used primary distance indicators . a possible extension of these standard candles to further distances would be important . in this context , a very promising new tool is represented by the ultra - long period ( ulp ) cepheids ( p@xmath180  days ) , recently identified in star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> only a small number of ulp cepheids have been discovered so far . </S>",
    "<S> here we present and analyse the properties of an updated sample of 37 ulp cepheids observed in galaxies within a very large metallicity range of 12@xmath2log(o / h ) from @xmath37.2 to 9.2 dex . </S>",
    "<S> we find that their location in the colour(v@xmath0i)@xmath0magnitude diagram as well as their wesenheit ( v@xmath0i ) index - period ( wp ) relation suggests that they are the counterparts at high luminosity of the shorter@xmath0period ( p @xmath4 80  days ) classical cepheids . </S>",
    "<S> however , a complete pulsation and evolutionary theoretical scenario is needed to properly interpret the true nature of these objects . </S>",
    "<S> we do not confirm the flattening in the studied wp relation suggested by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the whole sample , we find that ulp cepheids lie around a relation similar to that of the lmc , although with a large spread ( @xmath3 0.4 mag ) . </S>"
