    "the structure of the photon can be studied via inclusive hard processes in photon - photon interactions in @xmath4 collisions and in photon - proton interactions in @xmath5 collisions . at lep , centre - of - mass energies ranging from 161 to 172 gev allow to probe virtualities of the photon in the range @xmath6  2  and @xmath1 centre - of - mass energies in the range @xmath7  gev . at hera , electrons ( positrons ) of energy @xmath8  gev and protons of energy @xmath9",

    "tests of qcd and information on the parton densities in the photon and in the proton are obtained from measurements of jet , prompt photon , high@xmath0 hadron and heavy quark production .",
    "the structure of the real and virtual photon is measured directly in deep inelastic @xmath12 scattering ( dis @xmath12 ) .",
    "measurements of jet substructure and hadron production allow the study of parton radiation and fragmentation .",
    "at leading order ( lo ) qcd , three processes contribute to jet production in @xmath1 interactions : in the double - resolved ( dr ) processes a parton from one of the photons interacts with a parton from the other photon to give two jets in the final state ; in the single - resolved ( sr ) processes , one of the photons interacts as a point - like particle with a parton from the other photon ; and in the direct ( dd ) processes , both photons interact as point - like particles .    in @xmath2 interactions ,",
    "there are only two processes which contribute to jet production at lo qcd : the resolved ( r ) processes , in which the photon interacts through its partonic content with a parton from the proton , and the direct ( d ) processes , in which the photon interacts as a point - like particle .    the cross section for jet production at lo qcd in @xmath2 interactions is given by    @xmath13 and @xmath14    0em where @xmath15 is the flux of photons in the electron   is the fraction of the electron energy taken by the photon . ] which is usually estimated by the weizscker - williams approximation  @xcite ; @xmath16 are the parton densities in the proton ( determined from e.g. global fits  @xcite ) , @xmath17 is the fraction of the proton momentum taken by parton @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the factorisation scale ; and @xmath20 is the subprocess cross section , calculable in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . in the case of resolved processes , there is an additional ingredient : @xmath21 are the parton densities in the photon , for which there is only partial information , and @xmath22 is the fraction of the photon momentum taken by parton @xmath23 .",
    "the integrals are performed over the phase space represented by `` @xmath24 '' .",
    "1em    for @xmath1 interactions , the contributions to the jet production cross section at lo qcd may be written as    @xmath25    @xmath26 and @xmath27    the separation of resolved and direct processes used above has a meaning only at lo . for @xmath2 interactions , the variable @xmath28",
    ",    @xmath29 gives the fraction of the photon energy invested in the production of the dijet system .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the transverse energy and pseudorapidity , where @xmath32 is the polar angle . ] of the two highest transverse energy jets in the event , respectively .",
    "the @xmath28 variable can be used to define resolved and direct processes in a meaningful way to all orders . at lo qcd ,",
    "@xmath33 for direct processes .    at lo",
    "qcd , resolved processes dominate the jet production cross section for low @xmath34 and high @xmath35 and direct processes dominate for high @xmath34 and low @xmath35 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations of jet cross sections in pqcd depend on the factorisation ( @xmath19 ) and the renormalisation ( @xmath36 ) scales . at lo ,",
    "the dependence on the factorisation scale comes from the resolved part and is very large .",
    "it is largely canceled by the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd direct contribution and the factorisation scale dependence of the full nlo calculation is small .",
    "this is the reason why the separation of resolved and direct processes in terms of the feynman diagrams is unphysical beyond lo .",
    "also , lo qcd calculations present a large dependence on the renormalisation scale , which is reduced at nlo .",
    "jet cross sections are calculated by applying a jet algorithm to the partons in the final state .",
    "the result of this procedure is trivial at lo , and only at nlo the cross section depends on the jet algorithm , e.g. a cone jet algorithm ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "the nlo corrections to the jet cross section , @xmath37 depend on the radius of the cone jet algorithm @xmath38 , and the factorisation and the renormalisation scales .",
    "there are several complete calculations of jet cross sections at nlo for @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions @xcite .",
    "two types of corrections contribute at nlo : the virtual corrections which include internal particle loops and the real corrections which include a third parton in the final state .",
    "the existing calculations differ mainly in the treatment of the real corrections . in ref .",
    "@xcite the phase space slicing method is used with an invariant mass cut to isolate the singular regions of the phase space . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the phase space slicing method is also used but with two small cut - offs to delineate the soft and collinear regions . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite uses the subtraction method . with these methods ,",
    "no unphysical cut - offs parameters are introduced and the dependence on the renormalisation scheme and the renormalisation and factorisation scales is reduced .",
    "these methods also allow the implementation of jet definitions .",
    "a detailed comparison of the calculations from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite has been carried out in @xcite for nlo calculations of dijet cross sections and lo calculations of three - jet cross sections . a reasonable agreement between the different calculations",
    "was found , and the differences are up to @xmath39 .      in hadronic type interactions ,",
    "jets are usually reconstructed by a cone algorithm @xcite .",
    "in nlo calculations , jet algorithms are applied on the partons and since there are only three in the final state , only up to two partons may build up a jet .",
    "experimentally , jets are found in the pseudorapidity ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 azimuth ( @xmath42 ) plane using the transverse energy flow of the event .",
    "the jet variables are defined according to the snowmass convention @xcite ,    @xmath43 @xmath44    in the iterative cone algorithm , jets are searched by maximising the summed transverse energy within a cone of radius @xmath38 .",
    "it may happen that jets overlap and an additional rule is needed to decide whether the jets should be merged .",
    "given the limitations in the nlo calculations , the overlapping of jets in the data can not be reproduced .",
    "this effect leads to uncertainties in the comparison between data and theory .      to perform tests of qcd and to extract information on the photon parton densities ,",
    "the experimental and theoretical uncertainties should be reduced as much as possible .    among the main experimental uncertainties we find the presence of a possible underlying event , which is the result of soft interactions between the partons in the photon and proton remnants ( for resolved events ) , and",
    "is not included in the calculations .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute energy scale of the jets is usually the major source of experimental uncertainty .",
    "jet cross sections are usually measured at the hadron level , whereas the predictions are calculated at the parton level .",
    "therefore , when comparing theory and experiment , hadronisation effects become another source of uncertainty .    on the theoretical side , since calculations are made only at nlo , the implementation of the iterative cone jet algorithm in the theory does not match exactly the experimental procedure .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty due to the missing higher orders qcd terms may be large .",
    "the presence of a possible underlying event has been investigated by the opal and h1 collaborations by studying the transverse energy flow outside the cone of the jets as a function of @xmath28 @xcite . for low values of @xmath28 ,",
    "the leading - logarithm parton - shower monte carlo calculations predict a smaller transverse energy flow than in the data when no multipartonic interactions ( mi ) are added .",
    "the multipartonic interactions are used to simulate the effect of the extra energy inside and outside of the jet cone that the soft underlying event would produce .",
    "the zeus collaboration has studied the transverse energy flow around the jet axis as a function of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the jets in the data are broader at large @xmath35 than in the monte carlo without mi .",
    "in particular , an excess of transverse energy towards the proton direction is observed in the data with respect to the monte carlo calculations .",
    "all these measurements give an indication of the presence of a possible underlying event for low values of @xmath28 , high values of @xmath35 and low @xmath34 .",
    "it is not possible to subtract unambiguously the contribution from the underlying event since a fraction of the transverse energy flow outside the jets comes from qcd radiation .",
    "a better solution is to find a region of phase space where the contribution of the underlying event is expected to be smaller .    to investigate the experimental uncertainties due to the underlying event",
    ", the zeus collaboration has made measurements of @xmath45 using the iterative cone algorithm with different cone radii and different @xmath34 thresholds @xcite .",
    "nlo calculations @xcite have been compared to the measurements : for @xmath46 , the data show an excess with respect to the calculations at high @xmath35 for low @xmath34 thresholds .",
    "this excess disappears if the cone radius is reduced to @xmath47 or the @xmath34 threshold is increased to 21  gev ; in both cases the nlo calculations provide a good description of the data in the whole @xmath35 range studied .",
    "the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale of the jets is usually the main source of experimental uncertainty . for the zeus experiment ,",
    "this uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the effect on the jet cross sections is @xmath49 and is highly correlated between measurements at different points .",
    "the h1 collaboration estimates the uncertainty on the energy scale to be @xmath50 @xcite which amounts to @xmath51 in the jet cross sections . for the opal experiment , the uncertainty on the energy scale",
    "is estimated to be @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "nlo qcd calculations refer to jets built out of at most two partons whereas the measurements refer to jets at the hadron level .",
    "an estimate of the effects of hadronisation has been obtained by zeus @xcite by comparing the cross sections for jets of hadrons and jets of partons calculated using the leading - logarithm parton - shower monte carlo pythia @xcite and it amounts to @xmath53 for @xmath54 . in pythia , fragmentation into hadrons is performed using the lund @xcite string model as implemented in jetset @xcite . using similar methods , h1 and",
    "opal estimated this uncertainty to be @xmath55 @xcite and @xmath56 @xcite , respectively , for their measurements .      the uncertainty coming from the missing higher - order qcd terms in the nlo calculations is usually estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales from @xmath57 to @xmath34 .",
    "the effect depends on @xmath34 and @xmath38 . for the phase space region in @xcite",
    ", it amounts to @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60  gev .",
    "the uncertainty in matching the experimental and theoretical jet algorithms is particularly important for the iterative cone algorithm due to the effects of overlapping and merging of jets .",
    "a partial solution is the introduction of an ad - hoc parameter called @xmath61 @xcite to control parton recombination in the theoretical jet algorithm according to the recipe that two partons are not combined if their distance in the @xmath62 plane is larger than @xmath61 .",
    "the effect on the calculations is estimated by varying @xmath61 between @xmath38 and @xmath63 , and amounts to @xmath64 for the measurements with @xmath47 in @xcite . for @xmath46",
    "the uncertainty is larger .",
    "thus , this effect constitutes the major source of uncertainty in the calculations .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath61 solution is limited only to nlo . besides , the iterative cone algorithm is not infrared safe beyond nlo .",
    "the best solution is to improve the iterative cone algorithm or use the inclusive @xmath65 cluster algorithm @xcite instead .      in the inclusive @xmath65 cluster algorithm @xcite",
    ", jets are identified by successively combining nearby pairs of particles until a jet is complete .",
    "the @xmath65 algorithm allows a transparent translation of the theoretical jet algorithm to the experimental set - up by avoiding the ambiguities related to the merging and overlapping of jets and it is infrared safe to all orders .",
    "the photon parton densities contain a hadronic part , which behaves like a normal hadron , and a part called anomalous , which is the direct coupling of the photon to a @xmath66 pair ,    @xmath67    at lo qcd , the photon structure function @xmath68 is proportional to the densities for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,    @xmath71.\\ ] ]    the structure of the photon can be then studied by direct measurements of @xmath68 in dis @xmath12 .",
    "a compilation of all the measurements of @xmath68 may be found in @xcite . from these measurements , parametrisations of the photon parton densities",
    "are determined @xcite and used in other processes to test the universality of the photon structure . however , since no momentum sum rule applies to the photon parton densities it is difficult to determine the gluon density from @xmath68 as in the case of a hadron .",
    "measurements of cross sections for processes involving a large momentum transfer ( e.g. jets , prompt photons , high@xmath0 hadrons , heavy quarks ) are compared to nlo calculations to test qcd and the available parametrisations of the photon parton densities .",
    "these measurements may also be used in global analyses to constrain the photon parton densities .",
    "effective parton densities can also be extracted from this type of measurements .",
    "the photon structure may be studied as a function of the virtuality , from real to quasi - real to virtual photons .",
    "the measured dijet cross section @xmath72 in @xmath1 interactions from the topaz @xcite , amy @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations have been compared to nlo qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the calculations give a reasonable description of the data .",
    "these comparisons will allow the possibility of discriminating between different parametrisations of the photon parton densities when uncertainties in data and theory decrease .",
    "the h1 collaboration has measured the double - differential inclusive dijet cross section @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "these cross sections are compared to nlo qcd calculations @xcite to discriminate between different parametrisations of the photon parton densities , and have been also used to extract a lo effective parton density in the photon .",
    "the resulting photon parton density exhibits an increase with the scale @xmath74 which is compatible with the logarithmic increase predicted by qcd ( due to the anomalous term ) .",
    "the gluon density in the photon at lo has been extracted from measurements of dijet cross sections @xcite and high@xmath0 inclusive charged particle production @xcite .",
    "the measurements are found to be consistent to each other and with current lo parametrisations of the gluon density in the photon .",
    "however , care must be taken when interpreting these measurements since they were performed assuming perfect knowledge of the quark densities in the photon .",
    "the gluon density extracted from the dijet cross sections contains additional uncertainties coming from the underlying event , absolute energy scale of the jets and hadronisation effects , and the density extracted from the inclusive charged particle measurements suffers from uncertainties of the fragmentation functions .",
    "the underlying parton dynamics can be probed by measurements of the angular distributions in two- and three - jet events .",
    "the distribution of the angle between the jet - jet axis and the beam direction in the dijet centre - of - mass system ( @xmath75 ) is sensitive to the spin of the exchanged particle in two - body processes .",
    "the dominant contribution in resolved processes proceeds via gluon exchange and the cross section is proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "direct processes proceed via quark exchange and the cross section is proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "the measured @xmath78 for resolved and direct processes separated according to @xmath79 for dijet invariant masses @xmath80  gev @xcite shows clear differences as @xmath81 .",
    "nlo qcd calculations @xcite give a good description of the data .    at higher dijet invariant masses ,",
    "the dijet cross sections as a function of @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be used to identify new particles or resonances that decay into two jets by deviations of the measurements with respect to the qcd predictions @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of the least energetic jet in three - jet events probes the dynamics beyond lo .",
    "the distribution of the angle @xmath84 , the angle between the plane containing the highest energy jet and the beam , and the plane containing the three jets , is different from pure phase space and consistent with qcd predictions @xcite .",
    "prompt photon production in @xmath2 interactions proceeds via direct ( @xmath85 ) and resolved ( @xmath86 ) processes .",
    "therefore prompt photon production provides a means to study the quark and gluon content of the proton and the photon .",
    "the advantage of prompt photon measurements with respect to jet cross sections is that the photon emerges directly from the hard interaction and is free from hadronisation effects .    at lo",
    "qcd , the calculation of the prompt photon plus jet production cross section is similar to that of jet production , except that one of the final - state jets is replaced by a photon .",
    "nlo corrections to the prompt photon production cross section are sizeable and the effect is most significant at large pseudorapidity of the photon . at present",
    "there are two sets of nlo calculations @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed using the phase space slicing method which allows the implementation of photon isolation cuts and jet algorithms as in the experiment .",
    "the measurements of the cross section for prompt photon plus jet production with photon isolation cuts @xcite are sensitive to the quark densities in the photon since they are done in a region of phase space where the gluon content of the photon is suppressed and the proton parton densities are well constrained .",
    "the nlo calculations @xcite describe reasonably well the data @xcite .",
    "the calculations based on the grv - g ho @xcite parametrisations of the photon parton densities provide a better description of the data than the ones based on gs - g-96 ho @xcite .",
    "inclusive hadron production at high@xmath0 provides a test of qcd and is sensitive to the photon parton densities .",
    "the detection of single mesons and baryons allows also the study of fragmentation .",
    "the advantages with respect to measurements of jet cross sections are that the ambiguities due to jet algorithms are not present , and the uncertainties coming from the energy scale and the underlying event are largely reduced . on the other hand , additional information about the fragmentation functions is needed .",
    "nlo qcd calculations for inclusive hadron production have been made in the @xmath1 @xcite and the @xmath2 @xcite regimes .",
    "the ratio of the measured cross section for inclusive hadron production in @xmath2 as a function of @xmath74 @xcite to the nlo qcd calculations @xcite shows that the calculations give a good description of the data .",
    "this is also observed for the measured cross section as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "however , even at nlo the uncertainty coming from the renormalisation and factorisation scales in the calculations is quite large .    in @xmath1 interactions , the nlo calculations @xcite fail to describe the large @xmath74 tail of the cross section measured by the mark ii @xcite and tasso @xcite collaborations at a centre - of - mass energy of 29 and 33.1  gev , respectively . at lep energies ,",
    "the nlo qcd calculations lie significantly below the data for @xmath87  gev for @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the data improves for higher @xmath90 .",
    "charm production in @xmath1 interactions proceeds via @xmath91 for direct processes and @xmath92 for single - resolved processes , which are predicted to give comparable contributions at lep energies ; the contribution from double - resolved processes is expected to be small .",
    "therefore , charm production in @xmath1 interactions is sensitive to the gluon density in the photon .",
    "the comparison of the nlo qcd calculations for the total cross section for charm production @xcite to the measurement by the l3 collaboration @xcite shows that direct processes alone can not explain the data and that a significant gluon content in the photon is required .",
    "charm production in @xmath2 interactions proceeds via @xmath92 for direct processes and @xmath93 for resolved processes .",
    "therefore , charm production in @xmath2 interactions is sensitive to the gluon content in the proton and in the photon . to study the gluon content in the proton , a region of phase space",
    "is selected so as to reduce the resolved contribution .",
    "charm quarks have been tagged by reconstructing @xmath94 mesons .",
    "the h1 collaboration has extracted the gluon density in the proton by measuring @xmath94 production in the @xmath2 and deep inelastic @xmath5 scattering regimes @xcite .",
    "both measurements agree , supporting the universality of the gluon density in the proton .    to study the photon parton densities , cross sections for @xmath94 production",
    "are measured @xcite in a region of phase space where the resolved contribution is sizeable and then compared to nlo qcd calculations @xcite based on different parametrisations of the photon parton densities .",
    "the nlo qcd calculations of @xmath95 in the massive scheme @xcite lie below the data , and the calculations of @xmath96 fail to describe the measurements for @xmath97 .",
    "the nlo qcd calculations in the massless scheme @xcite based on the gs - g-96 ho @xcite parametrisations of the photon parton densities are closest to the data ; however , in these parametrisations the charm and u - quarks contribute equally .",
    "the comparison of the measured dijet cross section as a function of @xmath28 for charm tagged events to nlo qcd calculations @xcite shows an excess of the data with respect to the calculations at low @xmath28 .",
    "this excess may constitute an evidence for the presence of charm in the photon , which is not included in the calculations .",
    "it has been confirmed from measurements of @xmath68 in @xmath12 interactions and observation of resolved processes in @xmath2 interactions , and of single- and double - resolved processes in @xmath1 interactions that real photons have partonic structure .",
    "virtual photons should also have partonic structure .",
    "qcd predicts that the parton densities of virtual photons become logarithmically suppressed as @xmath98 ( the virtuality of the probed photon ) increases at fixed @xmath99 ( the scale of the interaction ) .",
    "if @xmath100 , it is possible to `` resolve '' the photon .",
    "as in the case of the real photon , the virtual - photon parton densities contain a hadronic and an anomalous part .",
    "the first measurements of the virtual photon structure function were made by pluto @xcite .",
    "there exist two sets of parametrisations of the virtual - photon parton densities @xcite .",
    "both parametrisations extrapolate the real photon parton densities to the virtual photon regime .",
    "they differ in the treatment of the hadronic part : in @xcite , a fit is performed to a coherent sum of the lowest - lying vector meson states @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , whereas in @xcite the hadronic part is estimated by using the pion parton densities .",
    "the virtual photon structure can be studied in @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 interactions by measurements of jet cross sections .",
    "the cross section for jet production using virtual photons at lo qcd is similar to that for real photons except that the photon parton densities are replaced by those of the virtual photon .",
    "nlo qcd calculations for jet production using virtual photons in @xmath106 @xcite and @xmath105 @xcite interactions have been recently completed .    the data from zeus on the ratio of the dijet cross sections for resolved and direct processes separated according to @xmath79 as a function of @xmath98 @xcite have been compared to lo @xcite and nlo @xcite calculations for different parametrisations of the virtual - photon parton densities .",

    "parton radiation and fragmentation may be studied via the jet shape , which is the average fraction of the jet s transverse energy inside an inner cone of radius @xmath109 concentric with the jet defining cone @xmath38 ,    @xmath110    qcd predicts that at sufficiently high @xmath34 the jet shape is driven by gluon emission off the primary parton and that gluon jets are broader than quark jets .",
    "@xmath111 qcd calculations for the reaction @xmath112 give the lowest non - trivial order contribution to the jet structure and , therefore , present a strong dependence on @xmath19 , @xmath36 and @xmath61 .",
    "the zeus collaboration has measured the jet shape for jets in @xmath2 interactions using an iterative cone algorithm @xcite .",
