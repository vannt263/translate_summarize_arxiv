    "hydrogen absorption - line systems observed shortward of ly@xmath1 emission in quasar spectra constitute an important probe of the physical state of the intergalactic medium at high - redshift .",
    "these spectral features are shaped by the combined action of gravity , hydrodynamics and photoionization processes which determine the local density and the velocity field of neutral hydrogen within the absorbers .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the so called lyman-@xmath1 forest is generated by diffuse , sheetlike and filamentary structures with a mean density which is between 1 and 10 times higher than the cosmic average ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; miralda - escud et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these low - column - density systems are highly ionized by the extragalactic background of lyman continuum photons generated by young stellar populations and quasars . at the opposite extreme , lyman - limit ( lls , @xmath3 ) and",
    "damped lyman-@xmath1 ( dla , @xmath4 ) systems correspond to concentrations of atomic hydrogen which are optically thick to the cosmic ionizing background .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that they arise in dense gas clouds with a meatball topology . on cosmological scales ,",
    "they appear to form a collection of isolated clouds which trace the cosmic web .",
    "optically thick clouds are expected to emit fluorescent ly@xmath1 photons produced in hydrogen recombinations ( hogan & weymann 1987 ; gould & weinberg 1996 ) .",
    "this emission is concentrated in the outer parts of the clouds where hydrogen is significantly ionized by the external uv background ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , ly@xmath1 photons can not directly escape the clouds because of the large optical depth in the center of the line ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "each photon thus suffers a large number of resonant scatterings ( more precisely : absorptions and re - emissions ) by neutral hydrogen atoms in the ground state .",
    "each scattering adds a small doppler shift to the frequencies of the photons due to the thermal ( and turbulent ) motions of the atoms .",
    "therefore , photons execute a random walk both in frequency and in physical space until their frequencies are shifted sufficiently away from the line center and they are able to escape the medium in a single flight ( zanstra 1949 ) .",
    "monte carlo simulation ( e.g. ahn , lee & lee 2001 ; zheng & miralda - escud 2002b and references therein ) is the most popular method for addressing the radiative transfer problem .",
    "analytical solutions only exist for highly symmetric systems .",
    "for instance , the emerging spectrum from a plane - parallel and static homogeneous slab is characterized by two sharp peaks in the doppler wings of the line ( neufeld 1990 and references therein ) .",
    "the plane - parallel solution approximately holds also for self - shielded systems where the ionized layer which surrounds the neutral region is thin with respect to the characteristic radius of the cloud . in this ideal case ,",
    "optically thick systems act as efficient mirrors which convert nearly @xmath7 of the impinging ionizing flux into ly@xmath1 photons ( gould & weinberg 1996 ) .",
    "direct imaging of fluorescent sources would lead to a major advance in our understanding of galaxy formation . determining the size distribution of lls at @xmath8 would be crucial to distinguish whether they arise from photoionized clouds in galactic halos ( steidel et al .",
    "1995 ; mo & miralda - escud 1996 ) or in minihaloes formed prior to reionization ( abel & mo 1998 ) . at the same time , the intensity of the cosmic uv background could be inferred from the observed brightness of the fluorescent emission .    with present - day technology ,",
    "the detection of fluorescent emission from high - redshift gas condensations is challenging , but not impossible . at @xmath9 , the intensity of the diffuse ionizing background ( e.g. haardt & madau 1996 ) corresponds to a ly@xmath1 surface brightness of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "it is then not surprising that blind searches have only produced a number of null results ( lowenthal et al . 1990 ; martnez - gonzalez et al . 1995 ; bunker , marleau & graham 1998 ) .",
    "positive fluctuations in the ionizing background can be used to increase the signal .",
    "for instance , clouds lying close to a bright quasar are exposed to a stronger uv flux ( with respect to an `` average '' cloud ) and are then expected to be brighter in fluorescent ly@xmath1 .",
    "very recently , francis & bland - hawthorn ( 2004 ) presented a deep narrow - band search for ly@xmath1 emission in a field which lies next to the quasar pks 0424 - 131 .",
    "based on quasar - absorption - line statistics and on simple models for fluorescent emission ( gould & weinberg 1996 ) , they expected to detect more than 6 clouds but none were seen .",
    "these null results highlight the need for a more sophisticated analysis of fluorescent ly@xmath1 emission in realistic environments .    in this paper , we present accurate models of the fluorescent ly@xmath1 emission from llss at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "our study proceeds in three steps .",
    "first , we perform a hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation to compute the cosmological distribution of the baryons at @xmath11 . a simple radiative transfer scheme is then used to propagate the ionizing radiation through the computational box and to compute the distribution of neutral hydrogen and of recombinations .",
    "finally , a three - dimensional monte carlo code is used to follow the transfer of ly@xmath1 photons . as ionizing radiation",
    ", we first consider the diffuse background generated by the uv emission of galaxies and quasars ( haardt & madau 1996 ) .",
    "we then discuss an inhomogeneous case where the ionizing flux from a quasar ( which lies in the foreground of the gas clouds ) is superimposed to the uniform background .",
    "our detailed numerical analysis shows that simplified models ( e.g. gould & weinberg 1996 ) tend to overpredict the ly@xmath1 flux emitted from optically thick regions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our numerical techniques in  2 and present our results in  3 where we also discuss the implications of our analysis for present and future observations .",
    "finally , we discuss the limitations of our approach in  4 and we conclude in  5 .",
    "the formation and evolution of the large - scale structure in a `` concordance '' @xmath0cdm cosmological model is followed by means of an eulerian , grid based total - variation - diminishing hydro+n - body code ( ryu et al .",
    "we assume that the mass density parameter @xmath12 ( with a baryonic contribution @xmath13 ) , the vacuum - energy density parameter @xmath14 and the present - day value of the hubble constant constant @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the simulation is started at redshift @xmath18 and follows the evolution of gaussian density fluctuations characterized by a primordial spectral index @xmath19 and `` cluster - normalization '' @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 the rms linear density fluctuation within a sphere with a comoving radius of @xmath22 mpc ) .",
    "this is consistent with the most recent joint analyses of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering ( e.g. tegmark et al . 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "we use a comoving computational box size of @xmath23mpc where the dark matter distribution is traced by 256@xmath24 particles and the gas component is evolved on a comoving grid with 512@xmath24 zones . the nominal spatial resolution for the gas ( the mesh size )",
    "is @xmath25kpc ( comoving ) with the mean baryonic mass in a cell being @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "each dark matter particle has a mass of @xmath27 .",
    "all the results presented in this work are derived from the @xmath11 output of a simulation which does not include radiative cooling of the gas .",
    "the limitations of this assumption are briefly discussed in  [ discus ] .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of the radiative case to future work .      in order to compute the distribution of neutral hydrogen within a snapshot of the computational box , we need to simultaneously solve the radiative transfer problem for uv radiation and the rate equations describing the balance between the ionization and recombination rates .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume that hydrogen is in ionization equilibrium and use the  on the spot \" approximation ( baker 1962 ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively denote the planck constant , the electron number density and the hydrogen ionized fraction , volume number density , ionization cross section , temperature and case b recombination coefficient ( for which we use the fit by hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "the intensity of ionizing radiation per unit frequency and solid angle is given by @xmath36 ( in erg @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 ) .",
    "the frequency integral in equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) extends from the hydrogen ionization threshold , @xmath40=13.6 ev , to a maximum frequency @xmath41 ( which is , formally , infinite ) .",
    "a good approximation for our purposes is to assume @xmath42 , ( i.e. set the intensity of radiation to zero at frequencies above the ionization threshold for heii ) .",
    "the motivation is twofold .",
    "first , nearly all the photons with @xmath43 ( which anyway contribute only a few per cent of the energy available for h ionization in the uv background ) will be absorbed by he atoms ( haardt & madau 1996 ) .",
    "second , heii recombines faster than hi and the intensity of radiation at the heii lyman limit is typically lower than at @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , heii is more easily shielded from the ionizing background with respect to hi ( miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ) .",
    "this implies that heii - ionizing photons are absorbed in the outer regions of the gas concentrations where h is nearly fully ionized . in order to describe the hydrogen shielding layers we thus neglect heiii and assume that the neutral fraction of he coincides with @xmath45 ( zheng & miralda - escud 2002a ) . for a helium abundance of @xmath46 ,",
    "this corresponds to assuming @xmath47 with @xmath48 ( see also  [ fcf ] ) .",
    "other than this , the presence of he atoms is neglected in equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) .",
    "given that heii recombinations produce hi - ionizing photons and the relatively small number density of helium atoms and ions , this approximation should be reasonably accurate .",
    "note that also recombination radiation from heiii can ionize hi .",
    "however , considered the different spatial distribution of heiii and hi discussed above and the characteristic heiii - recombination time scales , we neglect the small local corrections to the hi - ionizing background deriving from this effect . in each cell of the simulation ,",
    "the diffuse ionizing background is approximately described by following the radiative transfer along 6  light - rays \" which propagate parallel ( and antiparallel ) to the main axes of the computational box . with this numerical trick",
    "we can treat anisotropic backgrounds ( created , for instance , by shadowing effects ) with a minimal request of cpu time ( see appendix [ 6dtest ] for a test of this approximation ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath49 the optical depth of a given cell along the @xmath50-th ray .",
    "this quantity is computed by integrating the product @xmath51 from a given starting location ( a light source ) in the box ( see below ) up to the first point of the cell crossed by the ray .",
    "the closest face of the cell is then exposed to a radiation field with intensity @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the input ionizing radiation before it is filtered by the gas distribution in the box .",
    "let us also indicate with @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 the cell size in physical units ) the optical - depth variation within the cell measured along one of its principal axes . in order to implement a photon conserving scheme ,",
    "we replace the left - hand side in equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) with the quantity @xmath56 where the sum is taken over the six rays ( labeled by the index @xmath50 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the number of ionizing photons ( per unit volume and time ) which are deposited in a given cell by the six rays . to describe the diffuse uv background , we assume that @xmath57 with @xmath58 the intensity of radiation derived at @xmath11 by haardt & madau ( in preparation , hereafter hm ) considering the emission from observed quasars and galaxies after it is filtered through the ly@xmath1 forest . and that the energy spectral index for quasar radiation is @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting hydrogen ionization rate is a factor 1.16 smaller than in the models by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) used by gould & weinberg ( 1996 ) .",
    "the spectrum is available at http://pitto.mib.infn.it/@xmath60haardt/refmodel.html .",
    "] we assume that underdense cells are exposed to the full , isotropic background .",
    "on the other hand , overdense cells see an anisotropic radiation field which is computed by using equation ( [ rt ] ) to propagate the input background starting from the surface where @xmath61 .",
    "the intensity of radiation ( and thus @xmath31 ) in each overdense cell depends on the ionized fraction of the surrounding region . to solve the non - local equations , we start our calculations by assuming that the whole simulation box is optically thin ( i.e. it is exposed to the input radiation field ) and we iterate the radiative transfer and ionization - equilibrium calculations until convergence ( within 1% ) is reached in each overdense cell .",
    "we use a similar approach to discuss the anisotropic radiation field generated by a quasar lying in the foreground of the simulation box along the observer s line of sight . for simplicity , we assume that the quasar lies distant enough from the simulated region that its emission can be modeled as a train of plane waves impinging onto a face of the simulation box .",
    "we also assume that the quasar input spectrum is identical to that of the cosmic background .",
    "given that @xmath58 is well described by a power - law of index -1.25 between @xmath44 and @xmath62 , this is a sufficiently good approximation for our purposes ( see also the extensive discussion in ",
    "[ uvb ] ) .",
    "we then write the quasar ionizing flux ( erg @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath63 ) as @xmath64 with @xmath65 the kronecker symbol and @xmath66 a dimensionless constant .",
    "this is equivalent to using @xmath67 in equation ( [ rt ] ) . in this case , we compute the optical depth starting from the face of the simulation box which is first reached by quasar light ( i.e. along the direction @xmath68 ) .",
    "a self - consistent calculation of the gas temperature requires a joint treatment of radiative transfer and hydrodynamics which is still beyond present - day computing capabilities . assuming that the photoionized gas is in thermal equilibrium , we find that @xmath69 k for the typical densities in the shielding layers ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "however , shock heating can easily drive the gas temperature to @xmath71 k. this is particularly important for the low - density regions ( @xmath72 ) where cooling processes are inefficient and the shocked material remains hot ( theuns et al . 1998 ) . in our analysis , we assume that @xmath73 k everywhere .",
    "this is an excellent approximation for highly overdense regions ( @xmath74 ) where the cooling time is shorter than the hubble time and the gas temperature rapidly approaches the equilibrium solution ( theuns et al .",
    "1998 ) . anyway",
    ", since the recombination coefficient @xmath35 has only a weak dependence on @xmath34 , fixing the temperature to @xmath75 k in the whole simulation box does not seriously affect our results .",
    "note that , at @xmath76 , the hydrogen recombination timescale is @xmath77 yr .",
    "ionization equilibrium will approximately hold only where @xmath78 is shorter than the characteristic quasar lifetime ( @xmath79 yr , porciani , magliocchetti & norberg 2004 ) , i.e. for @xmath80 . at lower densities ,",
    "our assumption of ionization equilibrium will then overestimate the hydrogen ionized fraction .",
    "this is not a problem for our study since , in the vicinity of a quasar , the ionizing flux is strong enough to nearly completely ionize the low - density intergalactic medium .",
    "it is worth noticing , however , that regions with @xmath81 will emit their recombination radiation after the quasar has switched off and will not be detectable in a survey centred onto a bright quasar .",
    "hydro - simulations have a finite spatial resolution and can not describe the gas distribution on arbitrarily small scales .",
    "in other words , they provide a coarse grained representation of the density field .",
    "however , the hydrogen recombination rate scales proportionally to the square of the local ( i.e. fine grained ) number density and is sensitive to small - scale inhomogeneities ( clumpiness ) within a simulation cell . in order to keep track of this discrepancy , we re - write the mean recombination rate within a cell as @xmath82 where the average is taken over a simulation cell and @xmath83 denotes the clumping factor of the gas ( we assume that different atomic species and ions have the same spatial distribution ) . in principal",
    ", the latter quantity can be estimated by comparing simulations with different resolutions and consistent initial conditions .",
    "we assume that @xmath84 is constant everywhere and we fix its value by imposing that the number density ( per unit redshift ) of llss in our simulation matches the observational data ( proux et al .",
    "2003 ) . along the entire box . ]",
    "this normalization procedure , which requires @xmath85 , partially overcomes the limitations of our simulation ( limited resolution and any missing physics ) .",
    "note that the observational data constrain the product @xmath86 so that there is no need to specify a priori the he ionization state as discussed in  [ rtran ] .",
    "using equation ( [ newrec ] ) , we compute the hydrogen recombination rate in each cell of the simulation . in order to convert this quantity into an emission rate for ly@xmath1 photons",
    ", we need to evaluate how many recombinations ultimately lead to a @xmath87 transition . for @xmath73",
    "k , nearly 44% of the atoms directly recombine to the ground level while 35% of the remaining cases ultimately produce excited atoms in the @xmath88 state which decays to @xmath89 via two - photon emission ( both fractions are weakly dependent on the gas temperature , see e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) . therefore , if the gas is optically thin to uv photons , only a fraction @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote the effective recombination coefficient to the @xmath93 level and the case a total recombination coefficient , respectively ) of the recombinations yield a ly@xmath1 photon .",
    "however , in the optically thick case , continuum photons produced by recombinations to the ground level can be captured by neutral atoms and produce additional ly@xmath1 radiation .",
    "the asymptotic yield in the extremely thick case ( case b approximation , where no continuum photon can leave the cloud ) is @xmath94 .",
    "we use this value to compute the emission rate of fluorescent ly@xmath1 photons in the simulation box .",
    "when we apply the method described above to our simulation , we find that the shielding layers ( where the transition between optically thin and optically thick regions occurs ) are poorly resolved ( see fig . [ rf ] ) .",
    "typically , they consist of very few cells which each correspond to an hi optical depth variation ( at the lyman limit ) of @xmath95 . however , for a proper treatment of the radiative transfer problem , more stringent requirements on the grid spacing must be met . in particular , the ly@xmath1-emitting regions must be resolved with @xmath96 . if not , both the spatial distribution of recombinations and the escape probabilities of ly@xmath1 photons along different directions ( see  [ mc ] ) are spuriously altered .    to solve this problem",
    ", we adaptively refine the ly@xmath1 emitting regions by interpolating the original density and velocity fields of the input simulation .",
    "we use the solution of the radiative - transfer problem for the original ( unrefined ) grid to select the regions to interpolate and the factor of refinement . given the memory limitations of the available machines , we use a @xmath97 cells sub - box ( which is particularly rich of structures ) of the original simulation and we interpolate every cell with a significant recombination rate ( @xmath98 of the maximum ) and @xmath99 .",
    "the level of refinement is scaled proportionally to @xmath100 ( up to a factor of 32 in each dimension ) in order to have a subgrid of cells with @xmath96 . eventually , we re - compute the radiative transfer for the adaptively refined grid .",
    "figure [ rf ] shows that the fraction of recombinations originated in cells with @xmath99 decreases from 30% to 7% as a result of this refinement .",
    "moreover , in the finer grid , only a negligibly small number of recombinations takes place in extremely thick cells ( @xmath101 ) compared with 12% of the original grid .",
    "as discussed in  [ fcf ] , we account for unresolved substructure in our simulation box by using a non - vanishing clumping factor in the equation of ionization equilibrium .",
    "density variations within a parent cell of the original simulation due to the refinement procedure described above could , in principal , significantly contribute to the clumping factor .",
    "if this is the case , we should then adopt a value @xmath102 for the refined simulation to reproduce the observed abundance of llss .",
    "we find that the clumping associated with the refinement is severe in the densest zones of the simulation ( which typically lie in the self - shielded regions and do not contribute to the ly@xmath1 flux ) but amounts to only a few per cent in the most rapidly recombining cells .",
    "for these , we can then safely adopt @xmath103 also for the refined box .",
    "increasing the spatial resolution of the simulation complicates the radiative transfer of ionizing radiation generated by recombinations .",
    "equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) assumes that every ionizing photon generated by a hii recombination is absorbed in the same cell in which is generated .",
    "however , this is no longer a good approximation for the adaptively refined cells which are optically thin to uv radiation . in this case",
    ", ionizing photons generated by recombinations can be absorbed in a different cell with respect to where they are created .",
    "this process is too complicated to follow without an accurate radiative transfer scheme and we use equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) also for the refined cells . how does this affect our results for the distribution of hi ? first , the propagation of recombination radiation can slightly extend ( of a few cells ) the thickness of the shielding layer of a gas cloud with respect to our results .",
    "the effect is probably more pronuciated in the outer shells where the gas density is lower .",
    "this should only redistribute the birth point of a small fraction of line photons . on the other hand , in the central part of the shielding layer ( which contributes most recombinations ) we expect that the flows of incoming and outcoming recombination radiation should nearly balance given that the hydrogen density shows little variations . in summary",
    ", our approximated treatment of recombination radiation should only slightly modify the spectral energy distribution of the emerging ly-@xmath1 line      we now combine the results of the previous sections ( namely , a set of arrays containing the ly@xmath1 emission rate , the hi density and the gas velocity field as a function of spatial position ) to compute the spectra and the projected image on the plane of sky of the fluorescent sources .",
    "the radiative transfer of resonant ly@xmath1 photons is modeled using a three - dimensional monte carlo scheme analogous to that employed by zheng & miralda - escud ( 2002b , see also ahn , lee & lee 2001 ) .",
    "the method follows a large number of photon trajectories as they are scattered within the hi density and velocity distribution of the hydro - simulation .",
    "we assume that ly@xmath1 photons are isotropically emitted with frequency @xmath44 in the frame of the recombining atoms ( the natural linewidth is negligibly small for our purposes ) . in the cosmic frame ( e.g. for an observer lying at the center of the simulation box and which participates to the free expansion of the universe ) ,",
    "the frequencies of the resonant photons appear doppler shifted by the projected velocities of the atoms along the photon trajectories .",
    "the velocity of a hydrogen atom with respect to the cosmic frame is given by the superposition of the hubble flow with the bulk motion of the gas ( i.e. the peculiar velocity of the fluid in the corresponding cell of the simulation ) and a random thermal velocity : @xmath104 with @xmath105 the atom position with respect to the center of the simulation box .",
    "the component of @xmath106 along the direction of the emitted photon is generated by extracting a gaussian deviate out of a distribution with zero mean and dispersion @xmath107 ( with @xmath108 the boltzmann constant and @xmath109 the atomic mass ) .",
    "the photon frequency can be conveniently expressed in terms of the variable @xmath110 which measures the frequency shift from the ly@xmath1 line center in units of the doppler width , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 denotes the speed of light .",
    "the mean scattering cross section of ly@xmath1 photons in the fluid frame is @xmath113 where @xmath114=0.416 is the ly@xmath1 oscillator strength , @xmath115 m is the classical electron radius and @xmath116 is the hjerting - voigt function . for the relatively low - densities we are interested in ,",
    "atomic collisions are not important and the damping coefficient @xmath117 can be expressed in terms of the spontaneous decay rate @xmath118 as @xmath119 .",
    "we use equation ( [ cs ] ) to determine the distance covered by each photon before it is scattered by an atom .",
    "we first extract a random deviate , @xmath120 , from an exponential distribution function and then we integrate the product @xmath121 along the photon direction of motion until the resulting optical depth equals @xmath120 .",
    "if the photon still lies within the computational volume , we select the velocity of the scatterer . note",
    "that , in order to be able to absorb line radiation , an atom must have a velocity component along the trajectory of the incoming photon , @xmath122 , which closely matches the doppler shift . from equation ( [ vo ] )",
    ", it follows that , in the fluid frame , @xmath123 is characterized by the following probability distribution @xmath124 we use the method presented by zheng & miralda - escud ( 2002b ) to generate deviates which follow this statistic .",
    "the perpendicular component of the thermal velocity in the scattering plane , @xmath125 , is then extracted from a gaussian distribution with a temperature - dependent dispersion as described above .",
    "a new direction for the photon is then randomly selected according to a phase function , @xmath126 ( with @xmath127 the scattering angle ) , determined by atomic physics .",
    "resonant scattering has an isotropic angular distribution , @xmath128 , while wing scattering is characterized by the rayleigh phase function , @xmath129 ( stenflo 1980 ) .",
    "we find that the two angular distributions give consistent outputs .",
    "all the results presented in this work are obtained assuming isotropic re - emission .    to determine the new photon frequency , we assume that the scattering process is coherent in the reference frame of the scatterer ( partially coherent scattering ) .",
    "this is appropriate when the excited atom undergoes no collisions before re - emission and the radiative damping coefficient is small ( avery & house 1968 ) .",
    "both conditions apply to ly@xmath1 radiation emitted by gas in the typical conditions of the shielding regions in the intergalactic medium .",
    "once the scattering angle and the photon velocity of the scatterer are specified , it is straightforward to compute the frequency shift of the re - emitted photon in the fluid frame : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the frequency shift of the incoming photon and @xmath132 is the angle between the direction of the incident photon and the direction of the scattering atom . a lorentz transformation is finally used to compute the frequency shift in the cosmic frame .",
    "the set of calculations described above is iterated until the photon escapes the computational box .      to produce spectra ( and broad - band images ) of the fluorescent emitters , we compute the surface - brightness of the computational box along the observer s line of sight ( hereafter , the @xmath31-axis ) .",
    "at each scattering , the probability that a photon will be re - emitted along this direction is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the angle between the incoming photon and the @xmath31-axis and @xmath135 denotes the ly@xmath1 optical depth of the scattering site along the observer s line of sight .",
    "for each photon and for each scattering , we sum this quantity to a counter in correspondence of the projected position of the scattering site and of the photon frequency .",
    "we thus obtain a three - dimensional array containing the surface brightness of fluorescent ly@xmath1 photons as a function of 2 spatial coordinates plus frequency .",
    "note that a simulated photon tends to remain for many scatterings in a rather small region before it eventually escapes .",
    "this means that photons contribute only to a few pixels surrounding their emission site .",
    "following zheng & miralda - escud ( 2002b ) , we test our implementation of the monte carlo scheme against the analytical approximation by neufeld ( 1990 ) for the optically thick , plane - parallel case .",
    "figure [ mctest ] shows that our code accurately reproduces the analytical solution which becomes exact in the limit of extremely large optical depths .",
    "in order to have an acceptable compromise between spectral resolution and cpu time , we only apply the monte carlo radiative transfer to the adaptively refined grid corresponding to a @xmath97 region of the original simulation box . to achieve a good signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "we generate @xmath136 photon trajectories for every simulation .",
    "we thus obtain high resolution spectra for each pixel of the resulting image that can be combined to simulate slit , line - emission integral field or broad - band observations .",
    "we first discuss the ideal case of a static gas distribution illuminated with a uniform and isotropic backround of ionizing radiation .",
    "this is obtained by artificially setting to zero the velocity field of the gas within our refined box .    in the left panels of figures [ cden ] and [ bbandhm ] ,",
    "we respectively show the hi column density distribution and the broad - band images ( @xmath60 90   in the oberved frame , centered at @xmath137  ) of the selected region illuminated with the diffuse uv background .",

    "therefore , our predictions for the surface brightness of fluorescent sources can be simply scaled down by 30% if future observations will prove that galaxies do not significantly contribute to the ionizing background at @xmath11 . ] for an observer at redshift @xmath143 , this corresponds to a ly@xmath1 surface brightness of @xmath144 the brightest fluorescent sources correspond to compact gas clouds with a meatball topology .",
    "this is because the diffuse uv background is bright enough to fully ionize gas concentrations with @xmath145 . in general , the shielding regions either lie within virialized structures or correspond to dense gas shells which are accreting onto collapsed objects .",
    "as we will see below , the velocity field of the infalling gas produces specific signatures in the ly@xmath1 spectra .",
    "the compact fluorescent sources lie along the filaments and sheets which characterize the distribution of neutral hydrogen on cosmological scales .",
    "for ease of reading , we label the three largest structures ( which each have a diameter of @xmath146 comoving mpc ) with the letters a , b and c ( see fig . [ cden ] ) .",
    "cloud c is composed of two sub - units and is a part of an elongated structure which extends towards cloud b. similarly , a filamentary plume of gas bridges clouds a and b.    simple reasoning based on the plane - parallel model for line transfer suggests that , in the absence of photon sinks ( e.g. dust ) , self - shielded ( isotropically - illuminated ) objects should shine with a surface brightness of @xmath147 ( hogan & weymann 1987 ; gould & weinberg 1996 ) . in our static simulation ( fig . [ bbandhm ] , left panel ) , the sb of self - shielded objects closely matches the predictions of this simple plane - parallel model .",
    "the sb distribution in the simulation ( dotted histogram in fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) shows a narrow peak at this expected value .",
    "in general , the sb scales proportionally to @xmath148 in the optically thin regions and asymptotically approaches its maximum value for self - shielded objects ( see the top - left panel in fig .",
    "[ cdsb ] ) .",
    "the brightest lines of sight in fluorescent ly@xmath1 correspond to optically thick systems with column densities @xmath149 which are thus associated with llss and dlas .",
    "all the photons of the ionizing background are converted into ly@xmath1 radiation within the shielding layers of these optically thick systems . in the absence of other sources of ionizing radiation",
    ", it is impossible to produce a stronger ly@xmath1 flux .",
    "this explains why the brightest objects in the left panel of figure [ bbandhm ] have a uniform sb and sharp boundaries which correspond to the regions with @xmath150 in the left panel of figure [ cden ] .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the more realistic case where we include the gas velocity field of the hydro - simulation .",
    "the corresponding ly@xmath1 emission rate is shown in the right panel of figure [ bbandhm ] .",
    "the overall pattern is similar to the static case , but a number of striking differences are noticeable .",
    "i ) _ the sb of self - shielded objects is no longer uniform ( e.g. the right - hand side of cloud a is nearly a factor of 2 fainter than the left - hand side ) ; _ ii ) _ the boundaries of the emitting regions are less sharp and self - shielded objects are surrounded by large , low - sb halos ; _ iii ) _ self - shielded objects can be significantly fainter ( or , very rarely , brighter ) than in the static case .",
    "the top - right panel in figure [ cdsb ] shows that the gas velocity field introduces additional scatter into the sb - @xmath151 relation with respect to the static case .",
    "the brightest lines of sight still correspond to @xmath149 but now two regions with the same column density can be associated with brightnesses which differ up to a factor of 5 . in consequence ,",
    "the sb distribution of optically thick regions is broader and it is slightly shifted to fainter fluxes with respect to the static case ( see the peak of the solid histogram in fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) .",
    "we find that the median sb of the self - shielded objects amounts to nearly @xmath152 of the value predicted by gould & weinberg ( 1996 ) . at the same time",
    ", a larger fraction of the sky has @xmath153 compared to the static case .",
    "( the power - law part of the solid histogram in fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) .",
    "as we will show below , this excess is caused by foreground scattering of the ly@xmath1 photons and is related to the presence of extended ly@xmath1 halos around self - shielded objects .",
    "a better understanding of the `` velocity - field effect '' can be achieved by comparing the spectra of the fluorescent emission in the static and in the general case . in the left and central panels of figure [ spectra ] ,",
    "we show the corresponding spectral energy distributions of the ly@xmath1 photons .",
    "these have been obtained positioning four slit spectrographs ( width @xmath154 arcsec and variable length ) on top of the three brightest sources as shown in the right panel of figure [ bbandhm ] . in a static gas distribution ,",
    "spectra have a characteristic double humped shape and are symmetric with respect to the line center . on the other hand ,",
    "in the general case the energy distribution is no longer symmetric .",
    "in fact , particular configurations of the velocity and density fields are able to strongly suppress one of the wings of the ly@xmath1 line and significantly lower the observed sb of the self - shielded objects . in the particular case of cloud",
    "a , a low - density concentration of neutral hydrogen is infalling onto the ly@xmath1 emitting region . the relative velocity ( along the line of sight )",
    "corresponds to @xmath155 and thus to a very high optical depth .",
    "therefore , most of the photons that , in the static case , leave the shielding layers along the line of sight in the red doppler wing will scatter within the infalling cloud and escape in other directions loweing the observed surface brightness .",
    "these photons will then form the extended ly@xmath1 halos which surround the brightest objects in figure [ bbandhm ] .",
    "the phase - space distribution of neutral gas in the vicinity of the emitting regions thus plays a fundamental role in reshaping the ly@xmath1 spectral energy distribution . in broad terms , infalling material diminishes the red wing of the spectrum , while gas which is receding from the emitting region ( which could also mean that the shielding layer is infalling onto a central object more rapidly than the surrounding gas ) damps out the blue peak of the spectrum .",
    "we find that the velocity dispersion of the gas within the regions crossed by the ly@xmath1 photons broadens the red and blue peaks of the spectrum by up to @xmath156  . on the other hand ,",
    "when both peaks are detectable , their separation is nearly independent from the detailed properties of the emitting regions and is set by the thermal velocity dispersion of the original cloud .",
    "in fact , in analogy with the plane - parallel case , the escape probability of a ly@xmath1 photon peaks at a frequency which only depends on the optical depth of its emission site and on the temperature of the medium . for a typical self - shielded cloud ( @xmath157 ) , the spectrum peaks at @xmath158 which , for the assumed temperature , corresponds to a separation of @xmath159  .    the two - dimensional spectra shown in the central panel of figure [ spectra ]",
    "clearly show that the gas velocity field within and in the vicinity of the shielding layers has a complicated structure which does not show the characteristic pattern of ordered rotation or symmetric infall considered by zheng & miralda - escud ( 2002b ) .",
    "we now discuss a case of anisotropic illumination , obtained by superimposing the ionizing flux from a quasar to the diffuse uv background .",
    "the quasar is imagined to lie a short distance in front of the computational box as seen by us , and thus enhances the uv illumination experienced by faces of gas clouds exposed to it .",
    "note that the `` boost '' factor @xmath66 ( defined in  [ rtran ] ) is determined by the intrinsic luminosity of the quasar and by its actual separation from the simulated region .",
    "the definition above can be generalized to any given quasar spectrum using the emitted rate of ionizing photons . at a physical distance @xmath160 from a quasar with monochromatic luminosity @xmath161 , we find @xmath162 the resulting @xmath151 distribution ( assuming a boost factor @xmath163 ) is shown in the right panel of figure [ cden ] .",
    "the corresponding broad - band image ( obtained accounting for gas velocities ) is presented in the left panel of figure [ bbandqso ] . as expected ,",
    "the self - shielded regions ( and thus the fluorescent sources ) are smaller with respect to the isotropic background case due to the extra - ionizing radiation produced by the quasar .",
    "this also makes the fluorescent sources brighter ( dot - dashed histogram in fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) since more recombinations will be produced to balance a stronger ionization rate . based on the ( plane - parallel ) slab model , where ly@xmath1 photons are emitted following a cosine law ( gould & weinberg 1996 )",
    ", one would have naively expected an increase in the ly@xmath1 surface brightness towards the observer by a factor @xmath164 with respect to the diffuse background case . with the incident quasar flux",
    "corresponds to a factor @xmath165 .",
    "] however , figures [ hist ] and [ cdsb ] clearly indicate that the slab model overstimates the sb of the self - shielded objects .",
    "this is not due to shadowing effects .",
    "in fact , the attenuation of the quasar flux by diffuse gas lying in front of the fluorescent clouds is generally negligible . comparing with a static simulation",
    ", we also find that gas motions can only explain a small part of this discrepancy .",
    "in fact , in the presence of a quasar , foreground scattering is reduced due to the lower neutral fraction present in low density gas and broad - band images tend to be more uniform than in the case of isotropic illumination . on the other hand ,",
    "the slab approximation no longer applies when the size of the shielding layers is comparable with the radius of a cloud . in this case ,",
    "ly@xmath1 photons produced at a particular point leave the cloud with a different angular distribution with respect to the plane - parallel case . for",
    "approximately spherical clouds and in the presence of uniform illumination , this effect is suppressed for symmetry reasons . however , when the ionizing flux is anisotropic , the ly@xmath1 sb does depend quite strongly on the geometry of the shielding layers .    to study how the sb of self - shielded objects along the quasar direction , @xmath166 , depends on the impinging flux",
    ", we performed a series of simulations with increasing @xmath66 .",

    "the solid line represents the best - fitting relation @xmath171 while the dashed line shows the predictions of the slab model .",
    "note that the geometric effect becomes more and more important as @xmath66 is increased .    where do the `` missing '' ly@xmath1 photons go ? in the right panel of figure [ bbandqso ] , we show the fluorescent emission along a line of sight perpendicular to the direction of quasar illumination ( assuming @xmath163 as in the left panel ) . in this case",
    ", the plane - parallel model predicts that the self - shielded objects should emit at sb@xmath172 . in our simulations , however , the shielding layer deeply penetrates in the clouds along the quasar direction and the slab model does not apply . in consequence ,",
    "self - shielded objects are much brighter than a slab along this line of sight .",
    "typically , @xmath173 for @xmath174 while @xmath175 for @xmath176 . in other words ,",
    "ly@xmath1 photons generated by the quasar ionizing flux are emitted within a wide solid angle . as a consequence of this partial isotropization , self - shielded clouds are fainter than expected ( based on the slab approximation ) along the quasar direction and brighter in the perpendicular directions .    finally ,",
    "in the bottom panels of figure [ cdsb ] , we show the sb - @xmath151 scatterplot for anisotropic illumination ( when observer , quasar and the simulation box are aligned ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that , while the sb keeps nearly constant for llss , on average , it steadily increases with @xmath151 for dlas .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by as follows .",
    "let us assume that self - shielded objects are nearly spherically symmetric .",
    "then , i ) the ionizing flux from the quasar depends on the incident angle with respect to the local density gradient in the clouds ; ii ) this cosine approaches unity for the central projected regions of self - shielded objects ; iii ) the column density reaches the highest values along these lines of sight .      knowing the size distribution of fluorescent ly@xmath1 sources is fundamental to planning an observational campaign for their detection .",
    "regrettably , our refined box is too small ( its size being @xmath177 comoving mpc ) to provide a statistically representative sample of optically thick sources . on the other hand , performing the line transfer on the @xmath178 mpc box would require an excessive amount of computer time . for these reasons , we decided to propagate only the ionizing radiation through the @xmath178 mpc box and to use the scatterplots in figure [ cdsb ] to convert the neutral - hydrogen column densities into ly@xmath1 fluxes .",
    "in fact , independently of the value of @xmath66 , all lines of sight with @xmath179 are approximately associated with a constant ly@xmath1 surface brightness ( within a factor of 2 uncertainty caused by the gas motion and cosine effects discussed above ) .",
    "we then adopt this threshold value to derive the size distribution of fluorescent objects . in figure [ sd1 ] , we present our results for an isotropic ionizing background ( @xmath180 ) . solid and dashed histograms respectively refer to objects with @xmath179 and to dlas .",
    "it is worth remembering that we fixed the value of the clumping factor in our simulation so as to reproduce the observed sky covering factor of llss . in consequence , if a significant fraction of the real systems have a characteristic size which is smaller than our numerical resolution , our simulation will overpredict the number of large systems in order to preserve the required normalization .    in figure [ sd2 ]",
    ", we plot the number density of self - shielded objects as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "we use three different thresholds for the source size : 3 ( which corresponds to barely resolved objects ) , 20 and 80 @xmath181 . in all cases ,",
    "the number of sources rapidly drops with increasing @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , higher values of @xmath66 characterize regions which are closer to a given quasar ( see eq .",
    "( [ bdef ] ) ) and , obviously , correspond to a lower number density of self - shielded objects .    from this figure , it is also possible to determine the number density of sources which are brighter than a certain threshold value @xmath182 .",
    "let us consider a ly@xmath1 source which is optically thick to ionizing radiation at a given distance from a quasar .",
    "let us also imagine that we can move the cloud towards the quasar thus increasing the @xmath66 factor .",
    "as long as the cloud keeps optically thick , @xmath166 monotonically increases",
    ". however , there exists a particular value of the boost factor , @xmath183 , at which the cloud is no longer able to self - shield .",
    "therefore , for @xmath184 , @xmath166 keeps roughly constant .",
    "the fraction of recombinations yielding a ly@xmath1 photon decreases from @xmath185 to @xmath186 when a cloud becomes optically thin .",
    "therefore , we expect a fully ionized cloud to be a factor of @xmath187 fainter in ly@xmath1 with respect to the optically thick case .",
    "thus , the number of self - shielded objects at a given @xmath66 coincides with the number of sources ( which are not necessarily optically thick ) with @xmath188\\ , \\mathrm{sb}_{\\rm hm}$ ] . in other words , the number of sources which are brighter than a given threshold can be computed with the following procedure .",
    "first , convert the threshold sb into an effective boost factor , @xmath189 .",
    "second , invert equation ( [ brel ] ) to find the value of @xmath190 such that @xmath191 .",
    "third , use @xmath192 in figure [ sd2 ] to determine the number density of the sources .",
    "fourth , use equation ( [ bdef ] ) to find the volume within which it is possible to have @xmath193 .",
    "the variation of the number density of fluorescent sources as a function of @xmath66 is somehow related to the proximity effect .",
    "hydrogen clouds in the vicinity of a quasar are strongly ionized and emit fluorescent radiation .",
    "in other words , the missing absorption systems which determine the proximity effect can be detected in emission through their recombination radiation .",
    "therefore , in analogy with studies of the proximity effect ( e.g. bajtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ; scott et al . 2000 ) , the number density variation of fluorescent sources around a quasar can be used to infer the intensity of the uv background . in this case ,",
    "reliable models of fluorescent emission are fundamental to convert the observed counts into a background amplitude .",
    "we can use the above to compare the predictions of our models with the recent observational results by francis & bland - hawthorn ( 2004 , hereafter fbh ) .",
    "these authors performed a deep narrow - band search for fluorescent ly@xmath1 emission in the vicinity of the @xmath194 quasar pks 0424 - 131 ( @xmath195 , @xmath196 ) . at the 5@xmath197 confidence level ( corresponding to a surface brightness of @xmath198 for sources larger than @xmath199 and to @xmath200 for unresolved sources )",
    "no source was been detected .",
    "based on the observed abundance of llss , fbh expected to find @xmath201 fluorescent clouds with a size of 100 arcsec@xmath202 .",
    "this estimate , however , does not take into account the ionizing radiation from the quasar .    assuming that our results at @xmath11 are approximately valid at the quasar redshift",
    ",    we simply assume that the ly@xmath1 surface brightness scales as @xmath203 , i.e. @xmath204 .",
    "we find that the sensitivity limits of fbh correspond to @xmath205 for sources which are larger than 100 arcsec@xmath202 .",
    "assuming that the ionizing backround keeps roughly constant in the redshift interval @xmath206 , from equation ( [ bdef ] ) we find that this corresponds to a distance from the quasar of @xmath207 ( physical ) mpc .",
    "this is the maximum distance from the quasar at which an optically thick cloud could have been detected .",
    "based on our simulations , we expect to find , on average , @xmath208 objects within a sphere of radius @xmath209 around the quasar .",
    "however , fbh limited their search to distances smaller than 1 mpc thus reducing the sampled volume by a factor 3.4 with respect to the theoretical limit . in this case",
    ", the expected number of sources ranges between 0.3 and 0.6 .",
    "therefore , the probability of detecting ( at least ) one source with one single observational run is @xmath210 ( assuming poisson statistics ) .",
    "our simulations clearly show that the results by fbh are thus perfectly consistent with our understanding of the intergalactic medium at high-@xmath211 .",
    "the detection limit for unresolved sources is less interesting .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath212 ( assuming that equation ( [ brel ] ) can be extrapolated to such high values of @xmath66 ) and @xmath213 .",
    "the number of expected sources in the associated volume of @xmath214 is therefore negligibly small .",
    "there are caveats to the simple calculations descrived above .",
    "for instance , we have assumed that all the ly@xmath1 sources lying within a distance @xmath215 from the quasar are brighter than @xmath190 .",
    "this assumption tends to overestimate the number of detectable objects .",
    "in fact : i ) self - shielded clouds lying in front of the quasar are much fainter and hardly detectable ( their sb actually depends on the angle between the line of sight and the quasar direction ) ; ii ) fully ionized clouds in the foreground of the quasar tend to be a factor of @xmath216 fainter than assumed above ; iii ) if the age of the quasar is shorter than the hydrogen recombination timescale no fluorescent sources will be detectable ( see the discussion at the end of  2.2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have assumed that our simulation box is representative of the gas distribution surrounding a quasar . since optically selected quasars at high-@xmath211 tend to sit within the most massive dark - matter halos formed at that epoch ( porciani et al .",
    "2004 ) , it is reasonable to expect that matter clusters ( and moves with larger peculiar velocities ) around them .",
    "therefore , we could have underestimated the number densities of fluorescent sources lying close to a quasar .    despite of the approximations",
    "listed above , we believe that our results provide the most reliable estimates for the abundance of fluorescent ly@xmath1 sources at high-@xmath211 carried out to date .",
    "optimized sampling strategies are certainly required to observe these objects .",
    "our simulations then represent a fundamental tool to plan observations around a given quasar .",
    "while numerical simulations are a useful tool to guide our understanding , they can not be considered a perfect model of reality .",
    "a potential limit of our simulation is the lack of radiative cooling .",
    "while this is not a concern for the diffuse intergalactic medium , it becomes worrisome for highly overdense regions .",
    "fluorescent ly@xmath1 sources have intermediate overdensities ( @xmath217 ) and are likely to be in equilibrium with the uv ambient radiation .",
    "we thus expect them to be mildly affected by cooling processes . in any case",
    ", most of the results discussed in this paper are nearly independent of the details of the gas distribution .",
    "both the velocity and the geometric effects will be present anyway .",
    "on the other hand , the size distribution of the sources might be more affected by the cooling processes .",
    "it is also worth stressing that there is no way of accounting for the effects of cooling and heating in a self consistent way .",
    "in fact , simulations where radiative transfer is fully coupled with hydrodynamics are still not viable with current supercomputers . moreover , other poorly understood processes ( like energy and momentum feedback ) play an important role . therefore , it is hard to judge the level of approximation that current simulations including gas cooling may reach .      is the finite resolution of our simulation affecting our results ?",
    "multiple metal lines are often associated with single dlas ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) thus suggesting the presence of a clumpy medium .",
    "unresolved sub - structure in our simulation might reduce the velocity effect and modify the outcoming spectra .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath218 implies that at least @xmath219 of the volume is in dense clumps .",
    "if these sub - structures have a diameter which is comparable to the cell size , we only expect a minor modification of our results .",
    "in fact , the gas velocity in the simulation should closely approximate the motion of these clumps .",
    "the only effect is then a slight doppler - shift of the entire ly@xmath1 spectrum of each cell .",
    "the opposite case , where each cell contains a large number of small substructures ( abel & mo 1998 ) , can be approximately discussed by considering an additional contribution to the thermal velocity dispersion . assuming a value of @xmath220 ( corresponding to roughly half the virial velocity of the host halos , haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1998 )",
    ", we find that the velocity effect is be strongly suppressed and the spectra are in better agreement with the slab model .",
    "note , however , that the existence of a sea of small subclumps is disfavored by observations .",
    "in fact , this scenario would produce broad absorption features instead of the multiple metal systems associated with single dlas ( cf .",
    "haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1998 ; mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 ) . in any case , the velocity dispersion within our simulated dlas is of the order of @xmath221 , in good agreement with observational data .      beyond fluorescent emission , additional ly@xmath1 radiation might be produced in the inner regions of the clouds .",
    "within gravitationally collapsed objects , the gas tends to dissipate its internal energy by emitting line photons ( e.g. haiman , spaans & quataert 2000 ; fardal et al .",
    "2001 ; furlanetto et al .",
    "similarly , internal star formation could act as a copious source of ly@xmath1 photons , but , whereas fluorescent emission is expected to extend over several tens of kiloparsec , the ly@xmath1 emission from star forming region should be more concentrated near the centers of galaxies ( furlanetto et al .",
    "we have focused here on the fluorescent emission generated by recombinations and these extra sources of line photons are not considered in our analysis .",
    "we will present a comprehensive model of ly@xmath1 emitters in a future paper .    at the same time we did not consider the destruction of ly@xmath1 photons by dust grains .",
    "little is known about the dust properties within the intergalactic medium at @xmath9 even though there is some evidence for the presence of dust in dlas ( fall & pei 1993 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the associated absorption of fluorescent photons is likely to be minimal due to the relatively low @xmath151 of the shielding layer ( e.g. gould & weinberg 1996 ) . on the other hand",
    ", absorption is expected to be more severe for ly@xmath1 photons produced close to and within the star - forming regions where dust is likely to be more abundant and the ly@xmath1 escape probability is lower .",
    "our results are based on the haardt - madau model for the uv background . at @xmath11 ,",
    "the adopted model has an amplitude at the lyman limit of @xmath222 erg @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and corresponds to an hydrogen ionization rate @xmath223 .",
    "even though on the low side , this is consistent with recent observational studies of the proximity effect , which give @xmath224 erg @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath225 ( scott et al . 2000 ) .",
    "our results should then considered conservative , because they account for a uv background intensity which is a factor of @xmath226 lower than current observational estimates .",
    "note , however , that a different normalization of the uv background can not change our predictions for the number density of fluorescent sources .",
    "in fact , we determined the clumping factor of the gas by imposing that the mean number of lls in the simulation matches the observational data .",
    "therefore , a stronger ionizing radiation field would require a larger clumping factor to fit the observed counts .",
    "if both @xmath58 and @xmath84 are multiplied by the same multiplicative factor , @xmath227 , the solution of the ionization equilibrium does not change .",
    "in fact , this is equivalent to multiply both sides of equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) by a constant factor .",
    "therefore our results for the number density and size distribution of fluorescent sources are robust with respect to the amplitude of the uv background .",
    "note , however , that the ly@xmath1 surface brightness of optically thick cloud would be higher by a factor @xmath227 with respect to equation ( [ tsb ] ) .",
    "consistently , the boost factor in equation ( [ bdef ] ) would decrease by a factor @xmath227 while equation ( [ brel ] ) would remain unaltered .",
    "some ( most likely minor ) modification of our number counts is instead expected if the spectral energy distribution of the uv background significantly differ from the assumed one .",
    "this crucially depends on the relative contribution of galaxies and quasars to the cosmic ionizing background .",
    "similarly , the spectral energy distribution of quasar radiation plays an important role . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the quasar spectrum is identical to that of the cosmic background .",
    "this corresponds to a energy index @xmath228 i.e. to a much flatter spectrum than inferred from quasar observations ( @xmath229 ) . what could be the effect of this assumption ?",
    "the average mean free path of ionizing photons from a spectrum with @xmath59 is only a factor of 20% smaller than for @xmath230 .",
    "therefore , radiation from a steep quasar spectrum should penetrate a bit less within hydrogen clouds with respect than our models .",
    "this might slightly modify the emerging ly@xmath1 spectra and reduce the importance of the geometric effect .",
    "note , however , that quasar radiation will be partially filtered by the igm before reaching the fluorescent clouds .",
    "thus , a spectrum with @xmath59 at emission will be transformed into a flatter distribution in the shielding layer of a cloud .",
    "we have presented a new method to produce realistic simulations of fluorescent ly@xmath1 sources at high redshift .",
    "we started by simulating the formation of baryonic large - scale structure in the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "a simple radiative transfer scheme was then used to propagate ionizing radiation through the computational box and to derive the distribution of neutral hydrogen .",
    "finally , the transport of ly@xmath1 photons generated by hydrogen recombinations was followed using a three - dimensional monte carlo code . as ionizing radiation , we first considered the smooth background generated by galaxies and quasars . then , as a second case , we superimposed to the background the uv flux produced by a quasar lying in the vicinity of the simulation box .",
    "our detailed numerical treatment improves upon previous work which was either based on rather crude approximations for the transfer of resonantly scattered radiation ( hogan & weynmann 1987 ; gould & weinberg 1996 ) or on highly symmetric semi - analytical models for the gas distribution ( zheng & miralda - escud 2002b ) .",
    "our results show that simple models ( e.g. gould & weinberg 1996 ) tend to overpredict the ly@xmath1 flux emitted from optically thick clouds . in fact , we identified two effects that reduce the fluorescent ly@xmath1 flux ( and modify the spectral energy distribution ) with respect to the widespread static and plane - parallel model .    _ velocity effect  _ the velocity field inside and around the shielding layers of a gas cloud influences the emerging line profile .",
    "the symmetry of the double humped spectrum is lost and , in most cases , one of the two peaks is severely suppressed . on average ,",
    "the sb of a cloud is reduced by @xmath231 with respect to the static situation .",

    ", the angular distribution of the emerging radiation is very different than in the plane - parallel approximation .",
    "for instance , close to a quasar , a cloud emits much less than predicted by the slab model in the direction of the quasar and much more in the other directions .",
    "the importance of these effects ( in particular of the angular redistribution of ly@xmath1 photons ) depends on the intensity of the impinging radiation . in equation ( [ brel ] )",
    ", we provided a fitting function for the maximum ly@xmath1 brightness of optically thick sources as a function of the incident ionizing flux . in figure",
    "[ sd2 ] , we presented our predictions for the number density of fluorescent sources with different sizes .",
    "these results are consistent with the recent null detection by francis & bland - hawthorn ( 2004 ) and represent a fundamental tool for planning future observations .",
    "we would like to thank piero madau for suggesting to consider the problem of anisotropic illumination in the presence of a quasar .",
    "we benefited from extensive discussions with francesco haardt , martin haehnelt , tom theuns and all the participants to the `` galaxy - intergalactic medium interactions '' program recently held at the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful suggestions which improved the presentation of our work .",
    "cp and fm acknowledge support from the zwicky prize fellowship program at eth - zrich and sc from the swiss national science foundation .",
    "the fluorescent ly@xmath1 flux from a source is proportional to the number of hydrogen ionizations taking place in the corresponding gas cloud . in order to simplify the radiative transfer problem for continuum radiation , in equation ( [ rt ] ) we only followed the propagation of ionizing photons along the 6 principal directions of the simulation box . in this appendix ,",
    "we first provide justification for the multiplicative factor @xmath232 which appears in equation ( [ rt ] ) and then test the 6-direction approximation . the factor @xmath232 in equation ( [ rt ] ) is obtained by discretizing the left - hand side in equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) along 6 preferred directions .",
    "note , however , than equation ( [ csi_ion ] ) applies to an infinitesimal volume element while our discretized version is used to describe finite cubic cells .",
    "it is clear that the approximation is correct for optically thin cells , but where does it break down ?",
    "let us consider a homogeneous cube of side @xmath55 ( corresponding to an optical depth @xmath100 ) illuminated by a uniform and monochromatic background with intensity @xmath233 ( photons per unit time , surface and solid angle ) .",
    "the ionization rate within the cube generated by the radiation background impinging on one face can be written as @xmath234 , with @xmath1 a numerical coefficient of order unity .",
    "we use a monte carlo method to compute @xmath1 as a function of @xmath100 .",
    "our results are plotted in figure [ cube2 ] . when the cell is optically thin @xmath235 , while @xmath236 when @xmath237 . a rather sharp transition between the two asymptotic regimes",
    "is observed for @xmath238 .",
    "note that , in the presence of a uniform background , the optically thin approximation adopted in the main text is accurate even for @xmath239 , where @xmath240 .",
    "given that , in our adaptively refined cosmological simulation , @xmath241 of recombinations take place in cells with @xmath242 , we used @xmath243 in our calculations .",
    "all this , however , applies to an isolated cell exposed to the ionizing background .",
    "we now want to test how accurately equation ( [ rt ] ) works in the shielding layer of an optically thick cloud .",
    "we thus consider a spherically symmetric cloud which is optically thin at his external boundary and thick at the center ( @xmath244 , with @xmath160 the radial coordinate which vanishes at the cloud center and @xmath120 the characteristic size of the cloud , which roughly mimics one of the clouds in our refined simulation ) .",
    "we then illuminate the outer boundaries of the cloud with a uniform ( over the external @xmath245 sr ) and monochromatic background .",
    "this is injected from the surface of a cube of side @xmath246 centered on the cloud and divided into @xmath247 mesh points . in figure",
    "[ cube2 ] , we compare the outcome of a detailed radiative transfer code ( porciani & madau , in preparation ) with our approximated method . note that in our six - directions approximation the ionizing flux penetrates slightly deeper into the cloud with respect to the exact solution .",
    "this happens because our method ignores photon trajectories which are oblique to the principal axes of the box . on the other hand",
    ", we find that our approximation produces 92@xmath248 of the ionizations that take place in the cloud .",
    "given the simplicity of our algorithm , this is a remarkable achievement .",
    "note that , adopting the optically thick approximation ( @xmath249 ) , we would have overestimated the number of recombinations by 38@xmath248 .",
    "these figures are rather stable and , for realistic cases , do not depend on the details of the optical depth distribution .",
