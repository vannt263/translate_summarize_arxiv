    "strongly correlated electron systems with orbital degrees of freedom have attracted much attention .",
    "typical examples are the manganite @xmath0 @xcite , the ruthenate @xmath1 @xcite , and the vanadate @xmath2 @xcite , where striking phenomena such as colossal magnetoregistance , triplet superconductivity , and heavy fermion behavior have been observed . the importance of orbital degrees of freedom has been suggested also in unconventional superconductors , such as @xmath3 @xcite and the newly discovered iron - based superconductor @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these interesting experimental findings have stimulated a number of theoretical works on electron correlations in the multiorbital systems . among them , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite has successfully applied to the multiorbital systems @xcite .",
    "the long standing issue of itinerant ferromagnetism has been investigated by dmft @xcite , and it has been clarified that not only the lattice structure but also orbital fluctuations under strong influence of the hund s coupling is important for the realization of ferromagnetism . the mott transition in the multiorbital systems has been also studied extensively by means of dmft .",
    "one of important conclusions of dmft is that orbital degeneracy strongly enhances fluctuations of spin , charge and orbital , which stabilize the renormalized metallic state @xcite .",
    "the observation of the orbital - selective mott transition in @xmath5 @xcite has further stimulated studies on the metal - insulator transition in the multiorbital systems .",
    "the dmft studies on the two - orbital hubbard model with different bandwidths have clarified that orbital fluctuations play a key role in the orbital - selective mott transition @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of the spatial correlations on the mott transition in the multiorbital systems have not yet been well understood , because the dmft does not treat spatially extended correlations .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to investigate how the spatial fluctuations of spin and orbital affect quasiparticle dynamics around the mott transition in the multiorbitals system , using a different appropriate method .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of spatial fluctuations of spin and orbital on the quasiparticle dynamics in the two - orbital hubbard model at quarter filling , using the cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft ) @xcite combined with the noncrossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite . in the absence of the hund s coupling , we show that the metallic state persists up to large coulomb interactions .",
    "this gives rise to the heavy quasiparticle behavior around the metal - insulator boundary .",
    "it is clarified that the hund s coupling strongly enhances the antiferro - orbital ( afo ) fluctuations , which suppress the quasiparticle formation .",
    "the strong hund s coupling induces the pseudo gap in the single - particle spectra . in the intermediate regime of the hund s coupling , we find more striking behavior , namely , a novel nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the single - particle excitations : the heavy quasiparticles once develop with lowering temperatures , and then they are suppressed at much lower temperatures .",
    "it is elucidated that this nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the single - particle excitations is caused by the competition between the quasiparticle formation and the afo correlations .",
    "we consider the two - orbital hubbard model on the two - dimensional square lattice , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an annihilation ( creation ) operator with spin @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and orbital @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) at the @xmath12th site , and @xmath13 is the number operator . here",
    ", @xmath14 denotes the nearest - neighbor hopping integral , @xmath15 the intra - orbital ( inter - orbital ) coulomb interaction , and @xmath16 the hund s coupling including the spin - flip and pair - hopping terms .",
    "we impose the condition @xmath17 due to the symmetry requirement .    in order to investigate the effects of spatially extended spin and orbital fluctuations around the mott transition , we employ cdmft , a cluster extension of dmft . in cdmft",
    ", the original lattice is regarded as a superlattice consisting of clusters , which is then mapped onto an effective cluster model via a dmft - like procedure .",
    "we use a two - site cluster model coupled to the self - consistently determined medium .",
    "we note that the tiling of the original lattice in two - site clusters is not unique . here , we define each site in the two - site cluster as the site @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in order to incorporate the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and afo correlations ,",
    "we choose a tiling configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , where the site @xmath18 is next to the site @xmath19 . using the above method",
    ", we can treat the short - range correlations of spin and orbital within the two - site cluster .",
    "the effective cluster hamiltonian is obtained as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the chemical potential and @xmath22 is the hopping matrix elements in the two - site cluster , respectively .",

    "the effective medium is described by the hybridization function @xmath35 . in terms of the self - energy @xmath32",
    ", the hybridization function is recomputed by , @xmath36^{-1 } ,   \\label{eqn : cdmft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation of @xmath37 is taken over the reduced brillouin zone of the superlattice . here , @xmath38 is the fourier - transformed hopping matrix for the superlattice .",
    "this procedure is iterated until numerical convergence is reached .        in dmft or the cluster extensions of dmft ,",
    "a solver of the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqn : eff ] ) is important .",
    "the numerically exact solvers are the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method @xcite , which are computationally expensive . as an approximate method , the exact diagonalization ( ed ) , iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) , nca , etc .",
    "have been used @xcite .",
    "nrg @xcite and dmrg @xcite have been successfully applied to single - site dmft but it is difficult to apply them to cluster - dmft @xcite or multiorbital systems . in cluster - dmft",
    "combined with hirsch - fye qmc @xcite , it is known that the sign problem becomes serious due to the hund s coupling or the pair hopping in the multiorbital system @xcite . in cdmft + ed @xcite ,",
    "the finite - size errors in the effective model ( finite @xmath29 points in ( [ eqn : eff ] ) ) become larger in the two - band model than the single - band model due to the memory limitation .",
    "ipt , which is the second order perturbation expansion in @xmath39 , gives a good approximation in the single - band hubbard model or periodic anderson model in the infinite dimensions @xcite , but it is qualitatively incorrect for the multiorbital models or cluster - dmft . on the other hand , in nca ,",
    "neither finite - size error nor sign problem arises .",
    "it is known that dmft + nca works well not only in the single - band models but also in the multiorbital models @xcite .",
    "the cluster - dmft combined with the nca has also been successfully applied to the single - band hubbard model @xcite , and @xmath14-@xmath16 model @xcite . in cdmft",
    "+ nca , we do not encounter much more serious problems in the two - orbital hubbard model than in the single band model .",
    "therefore , we employ nca as a solver of the effective model ( [ eqn : eff ] ) .",
    "nca is a perturbation expansion around the molecular limit and computationally inexpensive . in general",
    ", it gives rise to artificial non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) properties at lower temperatures than the fermi liquid ( fl ) coherence temperature @xcite . in the following discussion",
    ", we restrict our analysis to the temperature region around and higher than the fl coherence temperature .",
    "for several interaction strength @xmath40 without the hund s coupling @xmath41 . ]",
    "let us now investigate spatial fluctuations of spin and orbital in the two - orbital hubbard model at quarter filling using cdmft + nca .",
    "we have confirmed that our results for @xmath42 , which corresponds to the single band hubbard model , are consistent with the previous results @xcite .",
    "we first study the case without the hund s coupling . in fig .",

    "[ fig : dos_u ] .",
    "as further increasing @xmath39 , the quasiparticle peak is suppressed and vanishes at @xmath46 . for @xmath47 ,",
    "a gap is formed near the fermi level and the system becomes insulating .",
    "we thus find that the metal - insulator boundary exists at @xmath46 for @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath48-dependence of the dos is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_t ] . in the metallic phase ( @xmath45 )",

    ", @xmath50 is defined as the width of the quasiparticle peak at low temperatures . around the metal - insulator boundary ( @xmath51 ) , the coherence temperature becomes lower ( @xmath52 ) and the sharper peak develops at low temperatures .",
    "this behavior clearly demonstrates the evolution of the heavy quasiparticle at low temperatures . on the other hand , in the insulating phase for @xmath53 ,",
    "the gap becomes more prominent with lowering @xmath48 , although dos at the fermi level @xmath54 is finite at @xmath55 . at much lower temperatures",
    ", @xmath54 should vanish and the system is expected to be a real insulator .",
    "these results are quite different from those of the single - band hubbard model at half filling on the square lattice @xcite , but are consistent with those of single - site dmft @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "where one electron occupies each site as well as our model , the fl quasiparticle is strongly suppressed by antiferromagnetic ( afm ) fluctuations . on the other hand , in the latter case , where spatial correlations are not taken into account , the quasiparticle peak appears around the mott transition .",
    "therefore , in our case , spatial correlations of spin and orbital are strongly suppressed by orbital degeneracy , and the fl quasiparticles are stabilized .    ,",

    "we next investigate the system with the hund s coupling .",
    "in the presence of the hund s coupling , we find that the spatial correlations give rise to the pseudo gap in the quasiparticle excitation . in fig .",

    "as @xmath16 further increases , a pseudo gap evolves and the system becomes insulating .",
    "we note that this behavior caused by the hund s coupling @xmath16 is qualitatively different from the results of single - site dmft @xcite . within dmft , which does not treat the spatial correlations ,",
    "it is known that the hund s coupling reduces the energy gap of the mott insulator to @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , in dmft , the hund s coupling reduces the effective coulomb repulsion and tends to stabilize the metallic phase .",
    "the previous dmft + nca studies show that the quasiparticle peak in dos get enhanced as @xmath16 increases @xcite . on the other hand , in our cdmft , which properly incorporate spatial correlations ,",

    "the negative values of @xmath62 indicate the break - down of fl .",
    "we thus find the crossover from fl to nfl states at @xmath58 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the results of dos in fig [ fig : dos_j ] . in single - site dmft ,",
    "the renormalization factor increases as @xmath16 increases , but its mechanism is completely different from that in our case . within dmft , the effective interaction is reduced by @xmath16 , as mentioned above @xcite . therefore , the renormalization factor increases and the fl metallic state is stabilized . on the other hand , in our cdmft , which incorporates not only such local renormalization effects of @xmath16 but also nonlocal correlations , @xmath62 increases and shows the nfl properties .",
    "this behavior is also seen in the dynamical cluster studies of the single - band hubbard model at half - filling @xcite . in this case , the afm correlations disturb the fl formation and induce the nfl behavior . in our case , the afo correlations enhanced by the hund s coupling trigger the nfl properties in @xmath62 .     at @xmath43 with varying @xmath16 . ]    in fig .

    "these results are consistent with the results of dos and the renormalization factor .    to clarify how the insulating state is induced by spatial correlations , we calculate the nearest - neighbor spin correlation function @xmath71 and orbital correlation function @xmath72 .",
