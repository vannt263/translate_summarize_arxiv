    "for our purposes , the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube , or @xmath0-cube , is a graph whose vertices are binary @xmath0-tuples , with edges joining two vertices that differ in exactly one coordinate , i.e. , in the language of error - correcting codes , they have hamming distance one . an orientation of the @xmath0-cube specifies a head and tail for each edge , and the in - degree of a vertex is the number of incoming edges at that vertex . if an orientation has only two different in - degrees , say @xmath3 vertices of in - degree  @xmath1 and @xmath4 vertices of in - degree  @xmath2 , then there are @xmath7 vertices and @xmath8 edges ( by counting edge heads ) .",
    "our main result , proved by modifying suitable hamming codes , is that these obvious necessary conditions for the existence of an orientation with in - degrees @xmath1 and  @xmath2  non - negative integers @xmath3 and  @xmath4 satisfying these equations  is in fact sufficient .",
    "this question was implicitly raised by h.  iwasawa @xcite in a different context  finding strategies for specific hat guessing games that he introduced .",
    "there are many puzzles involving hats or `` hat guessing games '' .",
    "most of them have the following set - up : a team of @xmath0 players has an initial strategy session where they decide on their joint strategy .",
    "later , a referee ( or adversary ) places hats colored either 0 or 1 on the players heads , and the players can see all hat colors except that of their own hat .",
    "shortly thereafter , the players must simultaneously guess their hat color , with no communication between the players , or knowledge of other guesses , allowed .",
    "a game is specified by the goal that the players try to achieve ; if they are successful they each win one million dollars .",
    "examples include : ( 1 ) the hat placement is uniformly random and the players want to maximize the probability that all guesses are correct , ( 2 ) the players want to guarantee that at least @xmath9 guesses are correct , or ( 3 ) the players want to guarantee that either all players are right or all are wrong .",
    "iwasawa generalizes variant ( 3 ) by asking that either exactly @xmath1 players are correct , or @xmath2 players are correct .    at the initial strategy session the first thing that the players might do is to number themselves from 1 to  @xmath0 .",
    "a placement of the @xmath0 hats can then be identified with a binary @xmath0-tuple , which we will think of as a vertex of the @xmath0-cube .",
    "when a player sees all hat colors but her own , she knows that the placement is one of the two ( adjacent ) vertices of the @xmath0-cube .",
    "a _ strategy _ is a rule that tells each player which vertex to choose .",
    "thus a ( deterministic ) strategy , to be agreed on at the team s initial strategy session is an _ orientation _ of the @xmath0-cube . in other words , players agree that if after the hats are placed , they are `` on '' an edge , then they will guess as if the actual hat placement corresponds to the vertex pointed to by the arrow on that edge in the agreed - upon strategy . for example the edge",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to the situation when the second player sees @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the first , third , fourth and fifth players respectively .",
    "the orientation of the edge indicates that the second player will predict that her hat color is  1 .",
    "if the hat placement corresponds to a vertex  @xmath13 , then the number of correct guesses is the in - degree of  @xmath13 .",
    "so iwasawa s problem of finding strategies that guarantee that * either * @xmath1 answers are correct * or * @xmath2 answers are correct is equivalent to the problem of finding an orientation of the hypercube where each vertex has in - degree either equal to @xmath1 or to  @xmath2 .    for example , consider the special case mentioned above : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. , where the goal is that everyone guesses right or everyone guesses wrong . in this case",
    "there is an easy `` checkerboard '' winning strategy based on the fact that the hypercube is a bipartite graph .",
    "if @xmath13 is a bit string @xmath16 , @xmath17 , then let @xmath18 be the parity of the sum of the bits , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "all edges connect vertices of opposite parity .",
    "so one winning strategy is to orient every edge towards , say , its endpoint with even parity .",
