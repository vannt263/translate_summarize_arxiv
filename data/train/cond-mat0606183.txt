    "electron and hole doped cuprates share a similar phase diagram with antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases .",
    "however there are quantitative differences between them . while electron - doped show commensurate antiferromagnetism@xcite in a large region of the @xmath1 phase diagram there is a quick suppression of antiferromagnetism in hole - doped cuprates . there",
    "it is well established that inhomogeneities appear when doping the mott insulator . among them the stripes , where holes are aligned in a row , have acquired importance as a possible scenario to explain the phase diagram of the hole doped cuprates@xcite .",
    "the strongest experimental support for stripes comes from neutron scattering experiments@xcite that show incommensurate peaks .",
    "they have been interpreted as coming from anti - phase stripes where the line of holes separate antiferromagnetic domains of opposite sign .",
    "the case of the electron doped cuprates is less clear .",
    "the signal obtained in neutron scattering experiments is commensurate@xcite what would be compatible with in - phase inhomogeneities .",
    "this possibility can convene with theoretical predictions that incommensurate solutions will be more favored in hole than in electron doping@xcite .",
    "very recent measurements of thermal conductivity and neutron scattering@xcite in electron doped cuprates have been interpreted as in - phase stripes while experiments of nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite were seen as signatures of inhomogeneous structures .",
    "a low temperature pseudogap detected with tunneling spectroscopy@xcite points to the presence of a ground state other than superconductivity whose origin could rely in inhomogeneous configurations .    in this work",
    "we perform a systematic analysis of homogeneous versus inhomogeneous structures in the electron doped @xmath0 hubbard model using unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) calculations .",
    "stripes and inhomogeneities were predicted as a solution of the hubbard model with @xmath3 using uhf approximation@xcite . within this framework",
    "we compute the spectral function and the non - resonant raman response of the different configurations . in the study of commensurate antiferromagnetism",
    "it is interesting to have charge sensitive probes as the non - resonant raman response which can detect charge order due to the possible selection of different regions of the brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous solutions in electron doped have been studied previously with uhf in the three band hubbard model@xcite where they found that diagonal anti - phase stripes were the configuration lowest in energy .",
    "so far there are no evidence of these stripes in the experiments .",
    "we will use the simplest @xmath0 hubbard model which has shown to be able to explain the pseudogap and the phase diagram of electron doped@xcite cuprates and to give the correct low energy physics when compared with the two - band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 hubbard model has also been studied with uhf in the past@xcite where it was pointed out that @xmath4 favors homogeneous solutions in the electron doped case in contrast to the hole - doped .",
    "this was claimed to be due to the fact that @xmath4 does not frustrate the antiferromagnetism in the electron doped case as was also proven with other techniques as exact diagonalization in the electron doped @xmath5 model@xcite and in quantum monte carlo calculations of the @xmath0 hubbard model@xcite .",
    "metallic antiferromagnetism has been found in experiments@xcite .",
    "our calculations agree with the former results that homogeneous antiferromagnetism is more stable in the electron than in hole doped case but in this systematic study we have found that for _ large enough values of the on - site interaction _ @xmath6 and at _ intermediate doping _ in - phase inhomogeneous configurations have the lowest energy .",
    "this is in strong contrast with what happens in the hole doped case where inhomogeneities are already found very close to half - filling@xcite .",
    "the result is compatible with the recent theoretical proposal of phase separation at intermediate fillings@xcite .",
    "phase separation has also been claimed for the electron doped @xmath5 model@xcite .",
    "unrestricted hartree - fock can work better to explore the electron doped cuprates than the hole doped cuprates because when doping the @xmath0 hubbard model with electrons we fill the wider upper antiferromagnetic band where quantum fluctuations are expected to be less important .",
    "arpes experiments in electron doped@xcite cuprates show a fermi surface made of electron pockets for dopings of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 as expected from long range antiferromagnetic order@xcite .",
    "they also see the emergence of a hole - like fermi surface around the nodal direction at @xmath9 .",
    "this nodal signal seems to indicate the instability of the antiferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "as we work in the strong coupling limit we do not obtain the hole - like fermi surface at @xmath9 .",
    "it is known that to get it in mean - field calculations unrealistic values of @xmath10 are needed@xcite .",
    "this case has been explored with different techniques where quantum fluctuations are properly taken into account ( see @xcite ) but these techniques are not well suited for studying inhomogeneities . on the other hand arpes also indicates the presence of spectral weight in the insulator gap . theoretically ,",
    "these midgap states have been obtained by adding spin fluctuations to the mean field solution@xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous configurations also form midgap states which would be an alternative explanation of these states .    a related issue concerns recent puzzling experimental results of electron - doped cuprates .",
    "although the fermi surface found in arpes for most of the electron - doped cuprates lies in the antinodal direction , recent raman experiments have found that coherent quasi - particles mainly reside in the nodal direction of the brillouin zone@xcite in all the samples that they have analyzed ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and overdoped samples ) .",
    "in particular they see that the @xmath2 signal which involves averages mostly over the nodal region has a stronger quasiparticle component than the @xmath13 signal which deals with the antinodal .",
    "both signals show an incoherent background . in our calculations",
    "we find cases of inhomogeneous configurations that present a quasiparticle - like signal in the @xmath2 raman response although the fermi level does not cross the nodal region .",
    "we argue that this is an example of a case in which two - particle properties can not be induced from one - particle properties .",
    "we also find that inhomogeneities provide an incoherent background to the raman response absent in the case of homogeneous metallic antiferromagnetism .",
    "our results are qualitative .",
    "we do not pretend to do a close comparison with experiments for what we would have to take into account other very important effects as quantum fluctuations , scattering by impurities etc .",
