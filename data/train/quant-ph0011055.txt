    "the possibility of constructing computers that operate based on the laws of quantum physics has been raised by a series of theoretical results over the last twenty years @xcite . compared with classical computers ,",
    "the promise of these quantum computers lies in their potential ability to solve a wider class of problems `` efficiently ''  that is , without incurring an overhead in time or physical resources that increases exponentially with the problem size .",
    "several recent experiments brought this theory into practice using liquid - state nmr techniques , with coupled nuclear spins as quantum bits ( qubits ) . in these implementations",
    ", the spin - up and spin - down states represented the computational basis states @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this work for the first time demonstrated the feasibility of small - scale quantum computers .",
    "a characteristic feature of nuclear spin systems in equilibrium at moderate temperatures is that the spin polarization is typically only about @xmath2 to @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the spins are in a highly random or _",
    "mixed _ initial state , whereas the desired initial state for quantum computation is a well - known or _",
    "pure _ state .",
    "the ability to perform quantum computation with a mixed initial state derives from methods to create _ effective pure _ states  @xcite ; these are mixed states which produce the same signal , up to a scaling factor , as spins in the corresponding pure state .",
    "the preparation of effective pure states , however , is inefficient : the resulting signal strength decreases exponentially with the number of qubits @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "clearly , preparing effective pure states in this way is not a scalable approach to quantum computing .",
    "very high polarizations could be achieved by cooling the liquid nmr sample down to the milli - kelvin regime , but this would freeze the sample , reintroducing dipolar couplings and resulting in very broad lines and short coherence times , which is problematic for quantum computing .",
    "several proposals exist to address these complications  @xcite , but their feasability and scalability remain to be demonstrated .",
    "other physical cooling methods could be used to increase the initial polarization .",
    "the use of optical pumping  @xcite is promising , but the state of the art ( in liquid state ) is still far removed from generating highly polarized nuclear spins useful for quantum computation .",
    "two proton spins have recently been hyperpolarized using _ para _ hydrogen and subsequently used in a quantum computation  @xcite , but scaling to @xmath4 qubits requires precursor molecules which easily react with @xmath5 h@xmath6 molecules to form a stable quantum computer molecule .",
    "it is unlikely that any of these techniques in themselves will provide large - scale quantum computers .",
    "remarkably , an _ algorithmic _  and thus technology independent  solution to the state initialization problem was recently developed by schulman and vazirani  @xcite ( a related but less efficient algorithm was devised earlier by cleve and divincenzo  @xcite in the context of schumacher compression ) .",
    "their initialization procedure is based upon polarization transfer and allows one to fully polarize @xmath4 qubits starting from @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) partially polarized qubits .",
    "polarization transfer is widely utilized in the nmr community and the bounds on the achievable polarization enhancements have been well documented  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of schulman and vazirani lies in the development and analysis of an explicit algorithm for polarization enhancement which asymptotically ( for large @xmath4 ) approaches the entropy bound and does so _ in a runtime quasi - linear in @xmath4 and using a total number of spins @xmath7 which is linear in @xmath4_. since the overhead is only polynomial in @xmath4 as opposed to exponential in @xmath4 , this algorithm makes the initialization of room temperature nmr quantum computers , and of any quantum computer which starts from `` high temperature '' qubits , in principle scalable .    in this letter , we report the experimental realization of the key step of the schulman - vazirani scheme using liquid state nmr techniques .",
    "the experiment was performed on a homonuclear three - spin system , for which eigenvalue conservation allows a maximum polarization enhancement factor of 3/2 .",
    "let us define the polarization @xmath9 of a spin @xmath10 as the difference in probabilities between the spin up and spin down state , tracing out the other spins in the molecule .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the density matrix of the spin system and @xmath13 is the usual angular momentum operator of spin @xmath10 in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "so spin @xmath10 is in the ground state @xmath15 with probability @xmath16 and in the excited state @xmath1 with probability @xmath17 .    in thermal equilibrium at room temperature , the polarization @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a very small number , about @xmath2 to @xmath3 for typical magnetic field strengths , because the thermal energy @xmath20 is much larger than the energy difference @xmath21 between the spin up and spin down state .",
    "we will from now on associate a temperature with the polarization of a spin : a spin with relatively high polarization is considered `` cold '' , while one with low polarization is considered `` warm '' .",
    "the polarization of one or more spins can be increased reversibly by polarization transfer from the remaining spins in the same molecule via a sequence of rf pulses and delay times .",
    "the maximum polarization enhancement that can be achieved reversibly is bounded by entropy considerations .",
    "specifically , all reversible procedures , such as pulse sequences with negligible relaxation , must conserve the entropy , given by @xmath22 .",
    "however , bounds established using entropy conservation are often weak  @xcite , and a stronger universal bound on spin dynamics must be considered .",
    "the spin dynamics bound on polarization enhancement derives from eigenvalue conservation of the density matrix , a second necessary condition for reversibility .",
    "this bound can be calculated via the deviation density matrix @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( note that the polarization @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath25 , since @xmath26 is traceless ) . by convention in nmr and for the sake of simplicity",
    ", subsequent use of the term `` density matrix '' will actually refer to @xmath23 .",
    "suppose that we have an initial density matrix @xmath27 , and we seek to transform it into some final density matrix @xmath28 , which may be unachievable when using only unitary operations .",
    "we then wish to find among all the achievable final density matrices @xmath29 the one that is `` closest '' to @xmath28  that is , whose mathematical projection onto @xmath28 is maximized .",
    "equivalently , we wish to maximize the coefficient @xmath30 in the following expansion of @xmath29 : [ expansion ] _ f = aa+bb , where @xmath31 represents a matrix orthogonal to @xmath28 , so that @xmath32",
    ". it can be shown @xcite that [ max ] a^max= , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are diagonalized representations of @xmath28 and @xmath27 , with the diagonal elements arranged in descending order from left to right .",
    "when both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are already diagonal , evaluation of ( [ max ] ) is particularly simple , reducing to a rearrangement of the diagonal elements and a trivial trace calculation .    for a homonuclear three - spin system starting from thermal equilibrium at room temperature ( @xmath35 )",

    "application of ( [ max ] ) then readily yields a maximum possible projection @xmath38 onto @xmath28 . since the projection of @xmath39 onto @xmath28 yields @xmath40 , the maximum achievable polarization enhancement factor starting from thermal equilibrium is @xmath41 .",
    "the bounds on polarization transfer established more than ten years ago indicate that unitary polarization transfer procedures could in principle result in very high polarization enhancements  @xcite . however , only recently , due to the work of schulman and vazirani , did an _ explicit and efficient _ unitary procedure become available for transforming the thermal equilibrium state into a state in which a subset of the spins exhibits a polarization that asymptotically approaches @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "this procedure was originally invented to initialize the spins in nmr quantum computing in a scalable way , but it can be used to efficiently boost the polarization of any subset of a set of partially polarized qubits , regardless of their physical implementation as long as the available hamiltonians can generate the necessary unitary transformations .    the idea behind the schulman - vazirani scheme is to redistribute the entropy over the qubits , such that the entropy of a subset of the qubits approaches zero while the entropy of the remaining qubits increases and the total entropy is preserved . the following `` boosting procedure '' ( summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptcircuit1 ] ) serves as the building block for this polarization transfer scheme  @xcite :    given three qubits @xmath43 and @xmath44 with identical initial polarizations @xmath18 , the initial state @xmath45 , or for short @xmath46 , is one of the eight possible states @xmath47 , with respective probabilities @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath51 .",

    "note that _ conditioned _ on @xmath56 , the polarization of @xmath52 is now @xmath57 ( @xmath52 is almost twice as cold as before ) ; _ conditioned _ on @xmath58 , the polarization of @xmath52 is @xmath59 ( @xmath52 is at infinite temperature ) .",
    "however , _ overall _ , the polarization of @xmath52 is still the same as before , @xmath60 .",
    "the polarization of @xmath30 is of course also still @xmath60 .",
    "we then perform a not operation on @xmath44 followed by a fredkin gate ( table 1 ) with @xmath44 as the control qubit .",
    "the result is that @xmath30 and @xmath52 are swapped if and only if @xmath56 ( and thus if and only if @xmath52 has been cooled ) : @xmath61 if @xmath56 , and @xmath62 otherwise . on average , @xmath30 will thus be colder than before .",
    "the resulting polarization of @xmath30 is @xmath63 , where the higher order terms are negligible , so the polarization of spin @xmath30 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath64 .    in order to achieve increasingly higher polarizations ,",
    "this boosting procedure must be applied repeatedly , whereby a fraction of the cold spins obtained from one round is made progressively colder in the next .",
    "spins of little or no polarization are discarded in each round . analyzing the polarization transfer using energy and temperature considerations , schulman and vazirani demonstrated @xcite that the progression of rounds can be arranged so that @xmath4 bits with nearly optimal enhancement can be extracted .",

    "@xmath30 is lower than ideally achievable . given the absence of substantial coherences ( fig .",
    "[ dm ] ) , we attribute this suboptimal enhancement primarily to signal attenuation due to rf field inhomogeneity and , to a lesser extent , due to transverse relaxation .",

    "we have experimentally demonstrated the building block for the hyperpolarization procedure outlined by schulman and vazirani on a homonuclear three - spin system .",
    "however , the repeated boosting required in a much larger spin system would be counteracted by relaxation and other causes of signal decay , such as rf field inhomogeneity .",
    "also , it should be noted that when starting from thermal equilibrium at room temperature , the overhead in the number of nuclear spins required for the complete schulman - vazirani scheme is enormous  @xcite , despite its linear scaling : with @xmath108 , at most one out of every @xmath109 spins in a molecule can be fully polarized . yet , the schulman - vazirani scheme could become practical for enabling scalable quantum computation in conjunction with other techniques which increase the initial polarization , or in other quantum bit implementations with higher initial polarizations .",
