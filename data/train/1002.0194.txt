    "recently , the technical advances in cold atom trapping allowed the experimental realization of the anderson localization @xcite in quantum matter waves @xcite .",
    "the good tunability and controllability of optical lattices offer myriad opportunities for studying the disorder effects in ultracold atom system @xcite .",
    "so far , different techniques have been devised for the introduction of disorder in the ultracold atom system , such as speckle filed patterns in the optical lattice @xcite , random localized impurities by loading a mixture of two kinds of atoms with heavy and light masses @xcite , and incommensurate bichromatic optical lattices by superimposing two one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices with incommensurate frequency @xcite . in particular , the experiment @xcite has provided evidences of the existence of a bose - glass ( bg ) phase @xcite .",
    "interesting phenomenons are expected to appear in disordered systems when the interplay of disorder and interactions is taken into account .",
    "interactions between atoms can be controllably tuned by feshbach resonances in ultra - cold atom systems . while disorder can lead to localization of the wave function of a particle ,",
    "delocalization can arise as the consequence of interactions in some many - body systems .",
    "theoretically , for a repulsive bose gas it has been predicted that there is a quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase to an insulating bg phase with localized single - particle states as disorder is increased @xcite , however unambiguous observation of the superfluid - bose - glass transition is still under debate @xcite .",
    "a lot of attention @xcite has been payed to investigating the combined role of disorder and interactions in the strongly interacting ultra - cold atomic system . except numerical or approximate approaches , the exact solution for the many - body systems with the interplay of disorder and interaction",
    "are rarely known . in this paper",
    ", we study the interacting bosons on the incommensurate optical lattices with harmonic trap in the limit case with infinitely repulsive interaction which can be solved exactly .",
    "the 1d bose gas with infinitely repulsive interaction is known as the hard - core boson ( hcb ) or tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas @xcite , which can be exactly solved via the bose - fermi mapping @xcite and has attracted intensive theoretical attention @xcite .",
    "experimental access to the required parameter regime has made the tg gas a physical reality @xcite .",
    "for the hcb in 1d optical lattices , it is convenient to use the exact numerical approach proposed by rigol and muramatsu @xcite . following the exact numerical approach",
    ", we calculate the static properties of the hard - core bosons , such as one - particle density matrices , density profiles , momentum distributions , natural orbitals and their occupations , to exploit the superfluid - to - bg phase transition for the systems in incommensurate optical lattices with harmonic confining trap .",
    "furthermore , we study the nonequilibrium dynamical properties of expanding clouds of hard - core bosons on the 1d incommensurate lattices after turning off the harmonic trap suddenly .",
    "we find that the expansion dynamics for the superfluid phase and bg phase exhibit quite different behaviors , which may serve as a signature for experimentally detecting the transition from superfluid - to - bg phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model and the exact approach used in this paper . in section iii , we show properties of the ground - state for hard - core bosons on the incommensurate optical lattice with a harmonic trapping potential .",
    "section iv is devoted to studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system after the harmonic trap is suddenly switched off .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in section v.",
    "in the present section we describe the exact approach which we used to study 1d hard - core bosons on the incommensurate lattice with an additional harmonic trap . under the single - band tight - binding approximation ,",
    "the system of @xmath0 hard - core bosons in the 1d optical lattice can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the boson which fulfills the hard - core constraints @xcite , _",

    "the ground - state wave function of the system with @xmath0 spinless free fermions can be obtained by diagonalizing eq.([eqn1 ] ) and can be represented as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of the lattice sites , @xmath0 is the number of fermions ( same as bosons ) , and the coefficients @xmath22 are the amplitude of the @xmath23-th single - particle eigenfunction at the @xmath24-th site which can form an @xmath25 matrix @xmath26 @xcite .    in order to get the static properties of the ground - state , we calculate the one - particle green function for the hard - core bosons defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ground - state of hard - core bosons , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 . explicitly the state @xmath31 can be represented as @xmath32 with @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 for @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 .",

    "@xcite to calculate the one - particle density matrix directly .",
    "the momentum distribution is defined by the fourier transform with respect to @xmath48 of the one - particle density matrix with the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the momentum .",
    "the eigenfunctions or natural orbitals @xmath51 of the one - particle density matrix @xcite can be obtained by solving @xmath52 which can be understood as being effective single particle states with occupations @xmath53 . for noninteracting bosons ,",
    "all the particles occupy in the lowest natural orbital and bosons are in the bec phase at zero temperature , however only the quasi condensation exists for the 1d hard - core bosons . for hard - core bosons in the incommensurate optical lattice , the strong incommensurate potential can destroy the quasi - bec .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamical properties of expanding clouds of hard - core bosons on 1d incommensurate lattice after turning off the harmonic trap suddenly can be also calculated through the equal time green function . with the jwt",

    "they found that there is a critical characteristic density ( @xmath71 ) in the system , for @xmath72 the whole system is in the superfluid phase at zero temperature , and for @xmath73 there is a phase separation in the system with a mott insulating plateau in the middle of the trap with filling factor equaling one surrounding by the superfluid phase on the two sides . in this paper",
    "we mainly study the influence of the incommensurate potential which acts as the quasi - random potential and leads to localization of particles .",
    "we focus our study on systems with low characteristic density ( @xmath72 ) . for system with high characteristic density",
    "the properties are similar to the one with low characteristic density except that there is a mott insulator plateau in the system .",
    "the mott insulator plateau is not dramatically influenced by the incommensurate potential because the particles in the mott phase are already localized with one - particle density matrix @xmath74 . without especially illustration , properties studied in this section are for systems with low characteristic density .    following the method described in the above section",
    ", we can get the one - particle density matrix .",
    "the density profile is given by the diagonal elements of the one - particle density matrix , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "in the low characteristic density region , the density profiles for three different strength of the incommensurate potential are shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in the absence of the incommensurate potential ( @xmath65 ) ,",
    "the density profile is shown in fig.1(a ) with all the bosons being in the superfluid phase at the vale of the harmonic trap .",
    "as @xmath11 increases but is still small , the density profiles basically have the arc shape , but there are a lot of drastic oscillations in the profiles induced by the incommensurate potential . the amplitude of the oscillations becomes more and more large with the increase in @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath11 becomes large enough , the density almost oscillates in the range of @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",

    "however the superfluid regions exhibit similar behavior as the system in low characteristic density region .",
    "since there are many drastic oscillations in the density distributions , it is hard to tell that in which area the density is high in a density profile . in order to reduce the drastic oscillations ,",

    "the local average density distributions for three different values of @xmath11 are also shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "when @xmath65 , the local average density distribution is almost the same as the density profile with no drastic oscillations .",
    "as @xmath11 increases , plateaus appear at the shoulders of the arc ( see fig.[fig1](d ) ) , then become wider and wider .",
    "such kind of plateau is induced by the disorder , and thus we call it anderson plateau hereafter . when @xmath83 , the shape of the local average density does not change with the increase in @xmath11 . in fig.[fig1 ] ( e ) and ( f ) , the density distribution and the local average density distribution for @xmath67 are displayed .",
    "the number of the plateaus and their locations are related to the particle number and the strength of the harmonic trap . in fig.[fig1 ] there happened to be only two plateaus .",
    "for system with high characteristic density , the local average density distributions for different @xmath11 are shown in fig.[fig1](g ) .",
    "the mott insulator plateau always exists in the trap center as @xmath11 increases , except that the edges of the plateau are more and more dissolved into superfluid phase when @xmath84 .",
    "meanwhile new plateaus appear at the two sides of the distribution , which is similar to the one with low characteristic density as @xmath11 increases .",
    "the mott plateau in the trap center is characterized by @xmath85 which does not oscillate against the particle density in the anderson plateaus due to the existence of the incommensurate potential .    the mean particle fluctuation for various value of @xmath11 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( h ) .",
    "it is defined by @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the local particle fluctuation @xmath88 for hard - core bosons .",
    "we can see that @xmath89 decreases as @xmath11 increases because of the incommensurate lattice making the bosons difficult to hop . for system in high characteristic density region ,",
    "the local particle fluctuation for particles in the mott insulator plateau always equals zero as @xmath85 for any @xmath11 , whereas the particle fluctuation is not equal to zero for particles in anderson plateaus .",

    "<S> we study properties of the strongly repulsive bose gas on one - dimensional incommensurate optical lattices with a harmonic trap , which can be deal with by using the exact numerical method through the bose - fermi mapping . </S>",
    "<S> we first exploit the phase transition of the hard - core bosons in the optical lattices from superfluid - to - bose - glass phase as the strength of the incommensurate potential increases </S>",
    "<S> . then we study the dynamical properties of the system after suddenly switching off the harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the one - particle density matrices , momentum distributions , the natural orbitals and their occupations for both the static and dynamic systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the bose - glass phase and superfluid phase display quite different properties and expansion dynamics . </S>"
