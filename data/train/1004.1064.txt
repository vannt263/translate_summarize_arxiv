    "spherically symmetric potentials have become a well - established paradigm of colloidal science in past decades .",
    "@xcite this is because , at a sufficiently coarse - grained level , colloidal surface composition can be regarded as uniform with a good degree of confidence , so that relevant interactions depend only on relative distances among the particles .",
    "recent advances in chemical particle synthesis @xcite have however challenged this view by emphasizing the fundamental role of surface colloidal heterogeneities and their detailed chemical compositions .",
    "this is particularly true for an important subclass of colloidal systems , namely proteins , where the presence of anisotropic interactions can not be neglected , even at the minimal level .",
    "@xcite directional interactions introduce novel properties in such systems .",
    "these properties depend both on the number of contacts ( _ i.e. _ , the valency ) and the amplitude of these interactions ( _ i.e. _ , flexibility of the bonds ) , a notable example of this class being hydrogen - bond interactions , ubiquitous in biological , chemical , and physical processes .",
    "@xcite    as a reasonable compromise between the high complexity of interactions governing the above systems and the necessary simplicity required for a minimal model , patchy - sphere models stand out for their remarkable success in this rapidly evolving field .",
    "@xcite see ref . for a recent review on the subject .    within this class of models",
    ", interactions are spread over a limited part of the surface , either concentrated over a number of pointlike spots @xcite or distributed over one or more extended regions .",
    "@xcite while the former have the considerable advantage of a simple theoretical scheme @xcite which allows a first semi - quantitative description , the latter can easily account for both the effect of the number of contacts and their amplitude , unlike `` spotty '' interactions which are always limited by the one - bond - per - site constraint .",
    "in this paper we consider a particular model due to kern and frenkel @xcite of this patchy - spheres class wherein short - range attractive interactions  of the square - well ( sw ) form  are distributed over circular patches on otherwise hard spheres ( hs ) .",
    "interactions between particles ( spheres ) are then attractive in the sw - sw interfacial geometry or purely hard - sphere repulsive under the hs - sw or hs - hs interfacial geometries , and can sustain more than one bond  in fact , as many as the geometry allows  even in the case of a single patch assigned to each sphere . a number of real systems ranging from surfactants to globular proteins can be described with simplified interactions of these particular forms , with well - defined solvophilic and solvophobic regions , and despite their simplicity patchy hard spheres have already shown a remarkable richness of theoretical predictions .",
    "@xcite notwithstanding the discontinous nature of the angular interactions , highly simplified integral equation approaches are possible , @xcite but only very recently has a complete well - defined scheme , within the framework of the reference hypernetted - chain ( rhnc ) integral equation , been proposed and solved for patchy spheres .",
    "@xcite this integral equation belongs to a class of approximate closures which have been extensively exploited in the field of molecular associating fluids .",
    "@xcite its main advantage over other available approximations ( other than its less - accurate parent hnc closure ) lies in the fact that it relies on a single approximation , for the bridge function appearing in the exact relation between pair potential and pair distribution function @xmath4 , @xcite to directly yield structural and thermodynamic properties that include the helmholtz free energy and the chemical potential with no further approximations .",
    "@xcite in addition , it can be made to display enhanced consistency among different thermodynamic routes .",
    "@xcite this is an important point when analyzing fluid - fluid phase diagrams such as we propose to do here .",
    "we thus build upon our previous work with the one - patch potential @xcite to study the two - patch case and its relationship with its one - patch counterpart .",
    "in addition to rhnc integral equation results , we provide dedicated monte carlo simulations which can assess the performance of rhnc .",
    "we find that rhnc provides a robust representation of both structural and thermophysical properties of the two - patch kern - frenkel model for a wide range of coverage @xmath0 ( the ratio between attractive and total hard - sphere surface ) , extending from an isotropic sw to a bare hs potential .",
    "the competition arising between phase separation and polymerisation is discussed in terms of the angular dependence of the pair correlation function and the structure factor .",
    "finally , a comparison between the one - patch and two - patch phase diagrams shows a strong impact on the different morphology and stable structures obtained in the two cases .",
    "we also report numerical simulation results of the model in the region where the rhnc integral equations do not numerically converge , to explore the low temperature , small @xmath0 limit .",
    "we find that for @xmath5 it becomes impossible to investigate the low - temperature disordered phases , since the system quickly transforms into an ordered structure , which itself depends on the coverage value .",
    "indeed , on decreasing @xmath0 one progressively enters the region where the maximum number of contacts per patch evolves from four to two and eventually reaches the one - bond - per - patch condition .",
    "when three or four bonds per patch are possible , the observed ordered structure is a crystal of interconnected planes , while when only two contacts are possible , particles order themselves into a set of disconnected planes .    the patchy interaction model examined here can be regarded as a prototype of a special colloidal architecture where there exist competitive interactions on the colloidal surface that drive , by free energy minimization , the different colloidal particles through a spontaneous self - assembly process into complex superstructures whose final target can be experimentally probed and properly tuned",
    ". @xcite the possibility , discussed in the present study , of identifying the position of the gas - liquid coexisting lines and its relative interplay with different structures , opens up fascinating scenarios in material science , on the possibility of novel material design exploiting a bottom - up process not requiring human intervention .",
    "as a paradigmatic model for highly anisotropic interactions , we take the kern - frenkel @xcite two - patch model where two attractive patches are symmetrically arranged as polar caps on a hard sphere of diameter @xmath6 .",
    "each patch can be reckoned as the intersection of a spherical shell with a cone of semi - amplitude @xmath7 and vertex at the center of the sphere .",
    "consider spheres @xmath8 and @xmath9 and let @xmath10 be the direction joining the two sphere centers , pointing from sphere @xmath8 to sphere @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the orientation of sphere @xmath11 is defined by a unit vector @xmath12 passing outward through the center of one of its patches , to be arbitrarily designated as the `` top '' @xmath13 patch .",
    "the patch on the opposite , `` bottom '' @xmath14 pole is then identified with the outward normal @xmath15 .",
    "two spheres attract via a square - well potential of range @xmath16 and depth @xmath17 if any combination of the two patches on each sphere are within a solid angle defined by @xmath7 and otherwise repel each other as hard spheres .",
    "the pair potential then reads @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 or @xmath22 indicates which patch , top or bottom , is involved on each sphere .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath23 are defined by the spherical angles @xmath24 in an arbitrarily oriented coordinate frame and @xmath25 is identified by the spherical angle @xmath26 in the same frame .",
    "reduced units , temperature @xmath27 and density @xmath28 , will be used throughout .",
    "this model was introduced by kern and frenkel , @xcite patterned after a similar model studied by chapman _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite as a minimal model where both the distributions and the sizes of attractive surface regions on particles can be tuned . in this sense",
    ", the model constitutes a useful paradigm lying between spherically symmetric models which do not capture the specificity of surface groups , not even at the simplest possible level , and models with highly localized interactions having the single - bond , single - site limitation .",
    "@xcite several previous studies have already examined potentials of the kern - frenkel form using numerical simulations , @xcite corresponding - state arguments , @xcite highly simplified integral equation theories , @xcite and pertubation theories .",
    "@xcite more recently , @xcite the single patch kern - frenkel potential was studied using a more sophisticated integral equation approach based on the rhnc approximation coupled with rather precise and extensive monte carlo simulations . in the present paper",
    ", we extend this last study to the two - patch kern - frenkel potential and provide new methodologies specific for the angular distribution analysis .",
    "we define the coverage @xmath0 as the fraction of the total sphere surface covered by attractive patches .",
    "thus @xmath29 corresponds to a fully symmetric square - well potential while @xmath30 corresponds to a hard - sphere interaction and the model smoothly interpolates between these two extremes in the intermediate cases @xmath31 .",
    "the two - patch potential is expected to present qualitative as well as quantitative differences with respect to its one - patch counterpart .",
    "one interesting question , for instance , concerns the subtle interplay between distribution and size of the attractive patches on the fluid - fluid phase separation diagram .",
    "it is now well established @xcite that as coverage decreases the fluid - fluid coexistence line progressively diminishes in width and height .",
    "indeed , this feature can be exploited to suppress phase separation altogether to enhance the possibility of studying glassy behavior @xcite and can not be accounted for with a simple temperature and density rescaling , @xcite although corresponding - state type of arguments can be proposed .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the above mechanism can significantly depend on how the same reduced attractive region is distributed on the surface of particles . in ref .",
    ", for instance , it was suggested that lines of decreasing critical temperature as a function of decreasing coverage , for the one - patch and two - patch kern - frenkel models with very short - range interactions , could cross each other at a specific coverage : for low coverages , critical temperatures for the one - patch model lie above the two - patch counterpart whereas the opposite is true for larger coverages .",
    "this would have far - reaching consequences on the phase diagram , as phase separation would occur at higher or lower temperatures for fixed coverage , depending on the specific allotment of the coverage .",
    "another interesting issue regards micellization phenomena , present in the one - patch version of the model , @xcite which is expected to be replaced by polymerization ( or chaining ) in the two - patch version . @xcite",
    "the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation @xcite defines the direct correlation function @xmath32 in terms of the pair correlation function @xmath33 ; it is convenient for computation to write it using the indirect correlation function @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "we have then @xmath36   c\\left(32\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a second , or `` closure , '' equation coupling @xmath37 and @xmath32 is needed . the general form for this",
    "is @xcite @xmath38 - 1-\\gamma\\left(12\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and a third pair function , the so - called `` bridge '' function @xmath40 , has also been introduced . while known in a formal sense as a power series in density , @xcite @xmath40 can not in fact be evaluated exactly and at this point an approximation is unavoidable .",
    "the rhnc approximation replaces the unknown @xmath40 with a known version @xmath41 from some `` reference '' system . in practice ,",
    "only the hard - sphere model is today well - enough known to play the role of reference system . here",
    "we will use the verlet - weis - henderson - grundke parametrization @xcite for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the reference hard - sphere diameter .",
    "some computational details of the rhnc integral equation approach can be found in ref .",
    "( see expecially appendix a ) , so only the most relevant equations will be repeated here .",
    "solution of the ornstein - zernike integral equation for molecular fluids @xcite seemingly requires expansions in spherical harmonics of the angular dependence of all pair functions , a need that would be very problematic in the case of the discontinuous angular dependence in the present @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , the integral equation algorithm allows @xmath44 to remain unexpanded .",
    "@xcite there is a potential problem however in evaluating the gauss - legendre quadratures used in the numerical solution , in that of the angles @xmath45 used for an @xmath46th - order quadrature , none is likely to coincide with the angle @xmath7 defining the semi - amplitude of a patch .",
    "thus the algorithm will not `` know '' the correct patch size .",
    "this problem is ameliorated in the following _ ad hoc _ fashion .    from the interaction @xmath44 of eq .",
    "( [ ie : eq3 ] ) , the total coverage @xmath0 can be computed in terms of @xmath7 as @xmath47,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the heaviside step function , equal to @xmath8 if @xmath49 and @xmath50 if @xmath51 .",
    "the integrals can be readily evaluated to give @xcite @xmath52 this quantity can also be numerically evaluated by gauss - legendre quadrature using the @xmath46 roots @xmath53 of the legendre polynomial @xmath54 and the computed result compared with the exact value ( [ rhnc : eq5 ] ) .",
    "we may then vary @xmath46 so as to find that number @xmath46 ( typically kept between 30 and 40 ) that minimizes the known error in computing @xmath0 .",
    "all gaussian quadratures for that @xmath0 value are then evaluated with the same number @xmath46 of points , thus ensuring that minimal error arises from the selected angular grid .    in an axial * r * frame @xcite with @xmath55 , the internal energy per particle in units @xmath56 is obtained from @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes an average over spherical angle @xmath59 and where we have written out @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , the pressure @xmath61 is computed from the compressibility factor @xmath62 \\right \\rangle_{\\omega_1 \\omega_2 } \\right \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cavity function @xmath63 has been introduced .",
    "the angular integrations in these expressions are evaluated with gauss - legendre and gauss - chebyshev quadratures .",
    "finally , the dimensionless free energy per particle @xmath64 and chemical potential @xmath65 can also be directly computed from the pair functions produced by the rhnc equation ; the overall calculation is optimized by choosing the reference hard sphere diameter @xmath43 so as to minimize the free energy functional .",
    "@xcite we solve the rhnc equations numerically on @xmath66 and @xmath67 grids of @xmath68 points , with intervals @xmath69 and @xmath70 , using a standard picard iteration method .",
    "@xcite the square - well width is set at @xmath71 as a reasonable value dictated by the availability of isotropic square well results .",
    "@xcite further details of these and other computations can be found in ref . .    for an assessment of the performance of the rhnc integral equation ,",
    "we also perform nvt , grand canonical , and gibbs ensemble monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite following the path set in the one - patch case . @xcite standard nvt mc simulations of a system of 1000 particles are used to compute structural information ( pair correlation functions and structure factors ) for comparison with integral equations results , whereas grand canonical and gibbs ensemble mc ( gemc ) are used to locate critical parameters and coexisting phases .",
    "the exact locations of the critical points ( points connected by the thick dashed green line in fig . [ fig : fig2 ] ) have been obtained from the mc data assuming the ising universality class and properly matching the density fluctuations with the known fluctuations of the magnetization close to the ising critical point .",
    "@xcite for gemc , we use a system of 1200 particles , which partition themselves into two boxes whose total volume is @xmath72 , corresponding to an average density of @xmath73 . at the lowest temperature",
    "considered , this corresponds to roughly @xmath74 particles in the liquid box and 150 particles in the gas box ( of side @xmath75 ) . on average ,",
    "the code attempts one volume change every five particle - swap moves and 500 displacement moves .",
    "each displacement move is composed of a simultaneous random translation of the particle center ( uniformly distributed between @xmath76 ) and a rotation ( with an angle uniformly distributed between @xmath77 radians ) around a random axis .",
    "we have studied systems of size @xmath78 up to @xmath79 to estimate the size dependence of the critical point , with an average of one insertion / deletion step every 500 displacement steps in the case of grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) .",
    "we have also performed a set of gcmc simulations for different choices of @xmath80 and @xmath81 to evaluate @xmath82 .",
    "see ref . and additional references therein for details .",
    "locating coexistence lines is not an easy task within integral equation theory , given the fact that virtually all integral equations are unable to access the critical region with reliable precision due to significant thermodynamic inconsistencies among various possible routes to thermodynamics , a consequence of the approximation buried in the closure eq .",
    "( [ rhnc : eq2 ] ) .",
    "the rhnc closure is no exception to this rule , but has the strong advantage of relying on a single approximation expressed by the choice of the reference bridge function @xmath41 , at odds with other available closures which require additional approximations in constructing various thermodynamic quantities such as the chemical potential .",
    "here we follow the protocol outlined in ref . for the isotropic square - well potential and ref . for the one - patch kern - frenkel potential , where both the well - known pseudo - solutions shortcoming @xcite and the numerical drawbacks @xcite can be conveniently accounted for .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] depicts the location of the fluid - fluid coexistence line for the two - patch case upon varying the coverage @xmath0 .",
    "the limiting case @xmath29 corresponds to the square - well potential . both mc ( points ) and rhnc ( thick solid lines ) results are shown . as previously noted , rhnc is not able to approach the critical point close enough to provide a direct estimate of its location .",
    "however , since it provides a quite good description of the low - temperature part of the coexistence line , we have tried to use these data to approximately locate the critical point .",
    "visual inspection of the rhnc coexistence points reveals , in the cases where it is possible to go closer to the critical region , an unphysical change of curvature of the coexistence line moving from low to high temperature .",
    "for this reason , for each coverage we selected only data clearly consistent with a rectilinear diameter law .",
    "then we fitted those data with the following function ( corresponding to the first correction to the scaling @xcite ) : @xmath83 where the values of the exponents @xmath84 and @xmath85 are appropriate for the 3d ising model universality class .",
    "@xcite once @xmath86 and the amplitudes @xmath87 , @xmath22 have been determined , the critical density can be obtained from the rectilinear diameter best fit .",
    "the numerical results of such a procedure are compared with mc estimates of the critical points in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "it is evident that even though in general the validity of eq .",
    "( [ correction ] ) is deemed to be limited to a smaller neighborhood of the critical point , @xcite in the present case it provides an acceptable procedure for a quick first estimate of the critical point location .",
    "as the coverage decreases , the coexistence line shrinks and moves to lower temperature and density , as expected from an overall - decreasing attractive interaction .",
    "this trend can be tracked rather precisely by mc simulations down to remarkably low coverages ( @xmath88 ) and rhnc correctly reproduces this evolution down to @xmath89 coverage . below this value ,",
    "more powerful algorithms are required to achieve good numerical convergence .",
    "a few remarks are here in order .",
    "the coexistence curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] are consistent with previous analogous results reported in ref . but extend the range of temperatures and , more importantly , the range of coverages ( @xmath0 values ) .",
    "this allows a quantitative measure of the significant deviation from the simple mean - field - like results which can be obtained from the simple scaling ( not shown ) @xmath90 as suggested by the second - virial coefficient @xmath91 for this model , @xcite @xmath92 @xmath93 being the hard - sphere result .",
    "this is also consistent with the breakdown of the above simple scaling at the level of the third virial coefficient , derived in ref . for the companion patchy sticky - hard - sphere model . as we shall see later on ,",
    "the dependence of the critical temperature and density on _ both _ the coverage _ and _ the number of patches is one of the main results of the present work . as a final point",
    ", we note that all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] collapse into a single master curve upon scaling @xmath94 , in agreement with ref . .",
    "below @xmath88 , it becomes impossible to properly estimate the location of the critical point or the density of the coexisting gas and liquid phases .",
    "indeed , the gas - liquid separation becomes pre - empted by crystallization into a structure that depends on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the liquid phase , as an equilibrium phase , ceases to exist for small @xmath0 .",
    "this is strongly reminiscent of the disappearence of the liquid phase using spherical potentials when the range of the interaction becomes smaller than about 10% of the particle diameter , @xcite thus providing the angular analog of the same phenomenon .",
    "interestingly enough , the crystal structure which is spontaneously observed during the simulation depends on the value of @xmath0 , since the @xmath0 value controls the maximum number of bonds per patch . in the range of @xmath0 values such",
    "that each patch can be involved in four bonds , the observed ordered structure is made by planes exposing the sw parts to their surfaces ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](d ) ) . particles in the plane are located on a square lattice and adjacent planes are shifted in each direction by a half lattice constant , resulting in a reduced energy of -4 per particle ( _ i.e. _ , eight bonded neighbors ) . on decreasing @xmath0 below @xmath95 , the region where only three bonds per particle are possible ( @xmath96^{-1 } < \\sin\\theta_0 < [ \\sqrt{2}(1+\\delta/\\sigma)]^{-1}$ ] ) is entered and the crystal structure is made by interconnected planes of particles arranged in a triangular lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) ) . for @xmath97^{-1 }",
    "< \\sin\\theta_0 < [ \\sqrt{3}(1+\\delta/\\sigma)]^{-1}$ ] only two bonds per patch are possible and the system organizes into independent planes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3](b ) ) , this time turning a hs surface to their neighboring planes . particles in the plane are now arranged on a triangular lattice and each patch is able to bind only to two different neighbors located in the same plane , resulting in a reduced energy per particle of @xmath98 . when @xmath99 becomes smaller than the value @xmath100^{-1}$ ] ( corresponding to @xmath101 )",
    ", the one - bond - per - patch condition is reached and the system can form only isolated chains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) ) . in this limit",
    ", the system is expected to behave as the two single - bond - per - patch model .",
    "we turn our attention next to structural information , where the advantages of a reliable integral equation approach become evident .",
    "one has to keep in mind that gibbs ensemble and gcmc simulations are particularly painstaking , due to the combined effect of the required low temperatures and the aggregation properties of the fluid ( as detailed below ) , so that many of the state points examined here require several weeks of computer time . on the other hand , the rhnc integral equation , while rather demanding from an algorithmic point of view ( see _ e.g. _ appendix a of ref . )",
    "is a rapidly convergent scheme yielding solutions on the order of minutes , depending on the temperatures considered .",
    "a more profound advantage stems from the fact that , within the approximation defined by the rhnc closure , all possible pair structural information is in fact exactly available , unlike mc calculations where , though available in principle , their statistics would be so limited as to make such calculations impractical .",
    "thus , only the pair correlation function @xmath4 averaged over angle @xmath25 is computed . by symmetry , the resulting pair function in this context depends only on @xmath102 and @xmath103 and will be denoted here as @xmath104 ; see appendix b in ref . for details .",
    "consider then the unaveraged pair correlation function @xmath60 from rhnc in an axial frame with @xmath55 .",
    "two noteworthy configurations occur when ( a ) all four patches lie along the same line ( we denote this as the parallel @xmath105 configuration , with @xmath106 , the actual labeling of each patch being unimportant ) and when ( b ) patches on sphere @xmath9 lie on an axis perpendicular to those of sphere @xmath8 ( in this case @xmath107 , which we denote as the crossed ( x ) configuration ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] reports the results for the case @xmath71 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , which has been selected so that the fluid is above the coexistence line for all considered coverages , with configurations @xmath110 and x in the top and bottom panels respectively .",
    "values of coverages range from a full square - well potential ( @xmath29 ) to a hard - sphere potential ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "as coverage decreases , the contact value @xmath111 of the @xmath110 configuration has the unusual behavior of first a slight increase from @xmath29 to @xmath112 , followed by a more marked increase starting at @xmath113 up to the very small coverage @xmath114 limit which eventually backtracks to roughly the same value as at @xmath113 in the hard - sphere limit . at the opposite side of the well , @xmath115 ,",
    "an even more erratic behavior is observed , with an increase in the range @xmath116 , then a decrease for @xmath117 , a new increase down to @xmath114 , and a final sudden decrease to the hard sphere value @xmath30 .",
    "a somewhat similar feature occurs in the x configuration where within the entire well region @xmath118 one observes a sudden decrease from @xmath29 to @xmath119 and a more gradual increase until reaching the highest value for the hs case .",
    "it is worth noting that in the x configuration there is no discontinuous jump at @xmath120 for any value @xmath121 .",
    "the reason for this has already been addressed in ref .",
    "for the one - patch case .",
    "outside the first shell , there is a very weak dependence on the coverage , with a slight shift in the location of the second peak from a value of @xmath122 at the sw @xmath29 to a value of @xmath123 for lower @xmath0 .",
    "we compare rhnc integral equation results with mc simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "as noted above , only the averaged pair function @xmath104 can be compared and this is done in the figure for different values of the coverage @xmath0 at the same state point ( @xmath124 and for the same @xmath110 and x configurations considered earlier . the good overall performance of rhnc in representing mc results is apparent as both contact values at the well edges and the jump discontinuities are very well reproduced .",
    "it is instructive to contrast these results with those of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , as many of the abrupt changes appearing in the actual pair correlation function are smoothed out by the orientational average carried out here . for instance ,",
    "the characteristic jump at @xmath120 of the @xmath110 configuration ( top panel ) progressively decreases as coverage is reduced and disappears in the hard - sphere limit .",
    "conversely , the jump is present also in the x configuration ( bottom panel ) unlike the corresponding case of the full @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the strong increase of the @xmath110 configuration for low coverages is not present in this figure ; as remarked earlier , this level of detail in @xmath4 is one of the main advantages of an integral equation approach .",
    "an additional useful quantity to consider , in view of its direct experimental access through scattering experiments , @xcite is the structure factor , which will be denoted @xmath125 within our theoretical framework .",
    "@xcite this is also strongly related , via hankel transforms , to the radial distribution function @xmath126 , which is @xmath4 averaged over all orientations @xmath127 and @xmath128 of the patches and of the relative angular position @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath126 is also the simplest rotational invariant ( see ref . and",
    "appendix [ app : appb ] ) .    the structure factor and the radial distribution function",
    "are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] for two representative values of coverage , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , corresponding to almost fully attractive and almost fully repulsive limits .",
    "these values have been selected at the same state point previously considered ( @xmath109 , @xmath108 ) as having a very different behavior within the first shell @xmath131 .",
    "this high - density result is also contrasted with a low - density state point @xmath132 at the same temperature , a value which , in the temperature - density plane , lies symmetrically with respect to the coexistence curves in the single fluid phase for all coverages ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "a few features are worth noting . for density",
    "@xmath108 there is a significant coverage dependence , where the contact value @xmath133 for @xmath130 coverage is larger than that for the corresponding @xmath129 case and , conversely , the jump present at the other extreme @xmath134 is much smaller in the former than in the latter case .",
    "a similar feature also occurs for the low - density state point @xmath132 .",
    "this results from an angular average of the results given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "likewise , there is a marked difference in the behavior of the structure factor @xmath125 for the high - density case @xmath108 , both in the height of the first peak ( related to the @xmath133 value ) and of the secondary peaks ( related to the behaviors of @xmath126 in the @xmath135 region and of the @xmath136 discontinuity ) .",
    "similarly , in the low - density branch @xmath132 , the large @xmath137 value for the @xmath129 coverage case is signaling the approach to a spinodal instability which is clearly not present in the corresponding @xmath130 coverage",
    ".    one natural interpretation of the above results is the progressive rearrangement of the distribution within the first shell upon varying both the coverage and the density . to support this view",
    ", we consider the angular distribution within the first shell in the next subsection .      the nonmonotonic dependence of @xmath4 in terms of the distance @xmath138 for decreasing coverage @xmath0 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , is rather intriguing and requires an explanation . a similar ,",
    "albeit different , feature occurs even in the one - patch case , as shown in ref . .",
    "we have tackled this in two ways , illustrated in the following .",

    "this is a dense state point . under diluted conditions , @xmath132",
    ", we find a qualitatively similar behavior as in the dense case , with antiparallel alignment in the forward direction ( which can not be physically distingushed from the backward one ) .",
    "clearly the predominant antiparallel alignment is reflecting the tendency to micellization rather than polymerization which is built into the single patch symmetry .",
    "it is also interesting to contrast the coefficients of rotational invariants for the one - patch case with those obtained in the two - patch counterpart in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] . at variance with the two - patch case , here",
    "all coefficients are nonvanishing so that we consider the first nonvanishing instances , that is @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath155 , which are particularly useful as giving the projections over the important invariants .",
    "@xcite    we have evaluated these coefficients for the same state points considered in the two - patch case in fig . [ fig : fig11 ] for both dense or diluted conditions and small or large coverages .",
    "in contrast with the two - patch case , here the effect of coverage appears to be less significant , as can be inferred by inspection of the dense case @xmath108 ( left panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) . for the @xmath181 case  the projection coefficient along the ferroelectic invariant @xmath183 in appendix [ app : appb ]  we find a negative correlation within the well both for @xmath129 ( top left panel ( a ) ) and @xmath129 ( bottom left panel ( c ) ) , as expected from the tendency to form antiparallel alignments .",
    "likewise , the projection @xmath182 along the dipolar invariant @xmath184 is found to be negative and numerically similar to @xmath181 at both coverages , again indicating negative correlation to dipolar alignment . the only positive correlation is found for the @xmath155 component , which does not distinguish between up and down symmetry , in qualitative agreement with the two - patch analogue .    this situation is replicated in the diluted case ( right two panels ( b ) and ( d ) ) with different numerical values , thus indicating that these correlations are signatures of robust orientational trends induced by the the particular one - side symmetry of the single - patch potential",
    "we have performed a detailed study of a fluid whose particles interact via a two - patch kern - frenkel potential that attributes a negative square - well energy whenever any two patches on the spheres are within a solid angle associated with a predefined coverage and within a given distance given by the well width , and a simple hard - sphere repulsion otherwise .",
    "this model can be reckoned as a paradigm of a unit system with incompatible elements ( _ e.g. _ , hydrophobic and hydrophilic ) that can self - assemble into different complex superstructures depending on the parameters of the original unit ( _ e.g. _ , coverage ) .",
    "we have exploited state - of - the - art numerical simulations ( standard metropolis , gibbs ensemble , and grand canonical monte carlo ) coupled with rhnc integral equation theory following the approach outlined in previous work on a single patch .",
    "@xcite on comparing rhnc integral equation with numerical simulations , we find the former to be quantitatively predictive in a large region of coverage , even close to the gas - liquid transition critical region , over a range of coverage which is significantly larger than the single patch counterpart .",
    "the reason for this is attributed to the fact that rhnc uses the approximated hard - sphere bridge function , which retains spherical information , as a unique approximation throughout the entire calculation , a feature which works better for the more symmetric two - patch case than the highly asymmetric one - patch kern - frenkel potential .",
    "having assessed the reliability of the rhnc integral - equation approach , we have fully exploited its capabilities in providing detailed angular information that is typically inaccessible to mc simulations , as already discussed in ref . .",
    "this has been done in two ways .",
    "first , by computing the orientational distribution probability of parallel and perpendicular alignment of patches within a spherical shell in the region @xmath135 . this methodology is able to account for the erratic coverage dependence of the pair correlation function @xmath4 by clearly discriminating between small and large coverages at all densities .",
    "the same approach also enlightens the characteristic symmetries of the patch distributions when the two - patch case result is contrasted with the one - patch analogue .",
    "second , by computing the rotational - invariant coefficients that are the projections of @xmath4 over rotational invariants .",
    "again , this can discriminate between small and large coverages ( at all densities ) and single and double patches .",
    "our monte carlo results extend those originally obtained by kern and frenkel @xcite for the two - patch case and can be contrasted with those of the corresponding single - patch counterpart @xcite and those obtained when the radial part of the potential is of the baxter type .",
    "@xcite the rhnc calculation presented here , along with the corresponding calculation carried out in our previous paper , @xcite together constitute the first attempt to apply a well - defined integral equation theory to such highly anisotropic potentials having sharp angular modulation .    an important outcome of our calculations is the clarification of the combined effect that size and distribution of the patches have on the gas - liquid coexistence lines and critical parameters .",
    "the reduction of the bonding surface clearly decreases the critical temperature , an effect which can be related to the decrease in the bonding energy of the system .",
    "more interestingly , it also shows a suppression of the critical density , which can be interpreted along the same lines used in interpreting the valence dependence in patchy colloids .",
    "@xcite indeed , the maximally bonded structures require lower and lower local densities on decreasing @xmath0 . interestingly , while in the single - bond - per - patch condition the evolution of the critical parameters on decreasing valence can be followed down to the limit where clustering prevents phase separation , @xcite in the model studied here crystallization pre - empts the observation of the liquid - gas separation for @xmath185 .",
    "crystallization is here much more effective due to the analogy between the local fully - bonded configuration and the crystal structure .",
    "by contrast , crystallization is never observed for the one - patch case , where it has been shown that the lowest energy configuration is reached instead via the process of formation of large aggregates ( micelles and vesicles ) or via the formation of lamellar phases .",
    "@xcite this difference highlights the important coupling between the orientational part of the potential and the possibility of forming extended fully - bonded structures .",
    "our results indicate that , for a given coverage , in the two - patch case both the critical temperature and density are slightly higher then their corresponding one - patch counterparts , thus indicating that an increase of the valence favours the gas - liquid transition , in agreement with previous findings .",
    "a final important consequence of our study concerns the limit of very small coverages that is particularly interesting .",
    "indeed , it is possible to tune the structure of the system and control the topology of its ordered arrangement . by doing this",
    "we have observed a progression from the case where chains are stable ( in the one - bond - per - patch limit ) to the case where independent planes are found , evolving  for slightly larger @xmath0 values  into an ordered three - dimensional crystalline structure . each of these ordered structures is observed in a restricted range of @xmath0 values .",
    "this possibility of fine tuning the morphology by controlling the patterning of the particle surfaces may offer an interesting possibility for specific self - assembling structures .",
    "an additional perspective of our work should be stressed .",
    "several studies ( see _ e.g. _ ref . and",
    "references therein ) have exploited spherically - symmetric potentials to mimic effective protein - protein interactions , especially in connection with protein crystallization .",
    "@xcite this is clearly unrealistic for the majority of proteins where the distribution of hydrophobic surface groups is significantly irregular , a feature that can be captured , at the simplest level of description , by the model studied here .",
