    "statistical properties of earthquakes have attracted much interest in seismology as well as in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "statistical properties of earthquakes are often characterized by power - laws , _",
    "e.g. _ , the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law observed in earthquake size distribution , or the omori law observed in the time evolution of aftershocks frequency .",
    "the concept of `` self - organized criticality '' ( soc ) was advocated by p. bak @xcite . in this view",
    ", the earth s crust is supposed to be in a critical state , while seismicity has a close analogy to critical phenomena of thermodynamic second - order transition .",
    "several statistical models of earthquakes embodying such soc features of earthquakes have been proposed and studied .",
    "one standard model is the so - called spring - block or the burridge - knopoff ( bk ) model , in which an earthquake fault is modeled as an assembly of blocks mutually connected via elastic springs which are slowly driven by external force @xcite . while this model sometimes exhibits critical or near - critical properties under restricted conditions , generic properties of this model are not necessarily critical , often exhibiting `` characteristic '' properties accompanied by characteristic energy and time scales .",
    "for example , the bk model with the nearest - neighbor @xcite or the long - range interaction @xcite has turned out to exhibit either `` supercritical '' , `` subcritical '' or `` near - critical '' behavior depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "another statistical model extensively studied in statistical physics in the context of soc might be the so - called ofc model , which was first introduced by olami , feder and christensen ( ofc ) as a further simplification of the bk model @xcite .",
    "it is a two - dimensional lattice model where the rupture propagates from lattice site to its nearest - neighbor sites in a non - conservative manner , often causing multisite seismic events or `` avalanches '' .",
    "numerical studies have revealed that the ofc model exhibits apparently critical properties such as the gr law @xcite or the omori law @xcite , although there still remains controversy concerning whether the behavior of this model is strictly critical @xcite or only approximately so @xcite . in any case , the ofc model has been regarded as a typical non - conservative model exhibiting soc .",
    "earthquakes in nature sometimes exhibit characteristic properties accompanied by characteristic energy and time scales @xcite .",
    "in contrast to its critical feature , possible `` characteristic '' feature of the ofc model , if any , has attracted much less attention so far .",
    "botani and delamote observed that synchronized clusters of various sizes existed in the steady state of the ofc model with a large , but finite lifetime @xcite .",
    "more recently , kotani , yoshino and kawamura have revealed strikingly characteristic features of the model , by demonstrating that the local recurrence - time distribution of the ofc model exhibits a sharp @xmath0-function - like peak corresponding to rhythmic recurrence of events with a fixed period uniquely determined by the transmission parameter of the model @xcite , together with a power - law - like tail corresponding to scale - free recurrence of events .",
    "in fact , the ofc model was found to exhibit phenomena closely resembling the `` asperity '' known in seismology .",
    "such an asperity repeats to rupture sequentially , often more than ten times , with almost the same period and with the same site as an epicenter ( triggering site ) @xcite",
    ". statistics of epicenter sequences of the model was also studied by peixoto and prado in the framework of a growing complex network @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "following ref.@xcite , we further investigate spatiotemporal correlations of the ofc model , with particular emphasis on its characteristic features .",
    "in particular , we wish to unravel more detailed properties of the `` asperity '' involved in the model .",
    "it is found that , in the formation of the asperity , self - organization process occurs in which the stress in the asperity region gets more and more `` quantized '' to discretized values .",
    "this self - organization process promotes an epicenter of the preceding event to become an epicenter of the next event again with the period uniquely determined by the transmission parameter of the model .",
    "it is also observed that the epicenter of large events tends to lie at the tip ( or at the corner ) of the rupture zone , rather than in its interior .    after defining the model and explaining some of its basic properties in  2",
    ", we present our numerical data of the local recurrence - time distribution and of the stress distribution in  3 .",
    "various asperity characteristics are investigated in detail in  4 .",
    "the relation between the self - organization of the highly concentrated stress state and the asperity characteristics are clarified .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "analysis of the time evolution of the stress concentration is given in appendix .",
    "in the ofc model , `` stress '' variable @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is assigned to each site on a square lattice with @xmath3 sites .",
    "initially , a random value in the interval [ 0,1 ] is assigned to each @xmath1 , while @xmath1 is increased with a constant rate uniformly over the lattice until , at a certain site @xmath4 , the @xmath1 value reaches a threshold , @xmath5 .",
    "then , the site @xmath4 `` topples '' , and a fraction of stress @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is transmitted to its four nearest neighbors , while @xmath1 itself is reset to zero . if the stress of some of the neighboring sites @xmath8 exceeds the threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 , the site @xmath8 also topples , distributing a fraction of stress @xmath10 to its four nearest neighbors . such a sequence of topplings continues until the stress of all sites on the lattice becomes smaller than the threshold @xmath11 .",
    "a sequence of toppling events , which is assumed to occur instantaneously , corresponds to one seismic event or an `` avalanche '' . after an avalanche",
    ", the system goes into an interseismic period where uniform loading of @xmath12 is resumed , until some of the sites reach the threshold and the next avalanche starts .",
    "the transmission parameter @xmath13 measures the extent of non - conservation of the model .",
    "the system is conservative for @xmath14 , and is non - conservative for @xmath15 . a unit of time @xmath16",
    "is taken to be the time required to load @xmath12 from zero to unity .    in the ofc model ,",
    "boundary conditions play a crucial role .",
    "for example , soc state is realized under open boundary conditions , but is not realized under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the model under open boundary conditions goes into a special transient state where events of size 1 ( single - site events ) repeat periodically with period @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "these single - site events occur in turn in a spatially random manner , but after time @xmath17 , the same site topples repeatedly .",
    "although such a periodic state consisting of single - site events is a steady state under periodic boundary conditions , it is not a steady state under open boundary conditions because of the boundary .",
    "indeed , clusters are formed near the boundary , within which the stress values are more or less uniform , and gradually invades the interior destroying the periodic state . eventually , such clusters span the entire lattice , giving rise to an soc - like steady state . such clusters might be formed via synchronization between the interior sites and the boundary sites , the latter having a slower effective loading rate due to the boundary @xcite .",
    "in our simulation , the lattice studied contains @xmath18 sites with open boundary conditions , the pseudo - sequential updating proposed by pinho _",
    "et al _ being utilized @xcite .",
    "total of @xmath19 avalanches are generated where initial @xmath20 events are discarded as transients to ensure that the measurement is done in the steady state .",
    "it has been realized that the ofc model exhibits an soc - like critical or near - critical property .",
    "this is most clearly exemplified in a power - law - like size distribution of avalanches . as an example",
    ", we show in fig.1 the size distribution of avalanches on a log - log plot for several values of the transmission parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the avalanche size @xmath21 is defined by the total number of `` topples '' in a given avalanche , which could be larger than the number of toppled sites because multi - toppling is possible in a given avalanche .",
    "in fact , it is observed that multi - toppling rarely occurs in the model except in the conservation limit or in the regime very close to it .    .",
    "the slope of the data gives the value of @xmath22 , which is shown in the figure . ]",
    "as can be seen from fig.1 , a straight - line behavior corresponding a power - law is observed consistently with the previous works .",
    "the slope representing the @xmath23-value is not universal varying from @xmath24 to @xmath25 as @xmath13 is varied from 0.17 to 0.245 .",
    "the power - law feature is weakened as one approaches the conservation limit .",
    "the @xmath23-value is known to come around @xmath26 in real seismicity , while the @xmath23-value of the ofc model is distributed around this value @xcite .",
    "hergarten _ et al _ observed that the ofc model also exhibited another well - known power - law feature of seismicity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the omori law ( or the inverse omori law ) describing the time evolution of the frequency of aftershocks ( foreshocks ) @xcite .",
    "we show in fig.2(a ) on a log - log plot the frequency of aftershocks as a function of the time elapsed after the mainshock @xmath16 . as a mainshock",
    ", we consider an event of its size greater than @xmath27 .",
    "again , a straight - line behavior corresponding a power - law is observed consistently with ref.@xcite .",
    "note that hergarten _",
    "et al _ imposed free boundary conditions , while we impose open boundary conditions here .",
    "the slope representing the omori exponent @xmath28 is again not universal depending on the parameter @xmath13 as @xmath29 , 0.69 and 0.03 for @xmath30,0.20 and 0.23 , respectively . since the @xmath28-value is known to come around unity in real seismicity , the @xmath28 value of the ofc model is not necessarily close to real observation .",
    "similar results are obtained also for foreshocks : see fig.2(b ) . here",
    "the @xmath28-value describing the inverse omori law is equal to @xmath31 , 0.50 and 0.01 for @xmath30,0.20 and 0.23 , respectively .",
    "as one approaches the conservation limit @xmath32 , both aftershocks and foreshocks tend to go away .",
    "our results are consistent with the results reported by hergarten _ et al _ @xcite .    .",
    "mainshocks are the events of their size greater than @xmath27",
    ". the time @xmath16 is measured with the occurrence of a mainshock as an origin .",
    "aftershocks and foreshocks are defined as events of arbitrary sizes which occur in the vicinity of mainshock with the range parameter @xmath33 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "mainshocks are the events of their size greater than @xmath27 .",
    "the time @xmath16 is measured with the occurrence of a mainshock as an origin . aftershocks and foreshocks are defined as events of arbitrary sizes which occur in the vicinity of mainshock with the range parameter @xmath33 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    as such , the ofc model certainly possesses critical or near - critical properties like the gr law and the omori law . by contrast , its _ characteristic _ properties , most notably revealed in the existence of `` asperity '' @xcite , have received much less attention . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate such characteristic properties of the ofc model , which apparently coexist with the critical properties mentioned in this section .",
    "in this section , we report on our simulation results on the local recurrence - time distribution and the stress distribution , which turn out to exhibit pronounced characteristic properties .",
    "let us begin with the definition of the _ local _ recurrence time . in case of the globally defined recurrence time ,",
    "the next avalanche to measure recurrence may occur anywhere on the entire lattice . in view of the ordinary sense of earthquake recurrence , however , it might be more natural to introduce the recurrence time @xmath34 and its distribution function @xmath35 _ locally_.",
    "thus , one may define the local recurrence - time as the time passed until the next avalanche occurs with its epicenter lying in a vicinity of the preceding avalanche , say , within distance @xmath36 ( in units of lattice spacing ) of the epicenter of the preceding event , rather than in some remote place far away from the epicenter of the preceding event .",
    "one can also introduce the size threshold @xmath37 to look at the recurrence of large events of their size greater than @xmath38 .",
    "the local recurrence - time distribution of the model , @xmath35 , was calculated in ref.@xcite with varying the range parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the computed @xmath35 exhibited a sharp @xmath0-function - like peak at @xmath40 which grew as @xmath39 got smaller , indicating that many ( though not all ) events of the ofc model repeated with a fixed time - interval @xmath41 .",
    "the peak position turned out to be independent of the range parameter @xmath39 , the size threshold @xmath37 , and the lattice size ( as long as it was not too small ) .    in fig.3",
    ", we show the local recurrence - time distribution @xmath35 for avalanches whose size is greater than @xmath27 for fixed @xmath33 , with varying the transmission parameter @xmath13 toward the conservation limit @xmath32 . as @xmath13 is increased toward @xmath32 , the @xmath0-function peak is gradually suppressed with keeping its position strictly at @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the @xmath0-function peak is no longer appreciable at the expected position @xmath44=0.02 : see the arrow in the figure .",
    "clearly , the @xmath0-function peak of @xmath35 goes away toward the conservation limit @xmath32 .     for a fixed range parameter @xmath33 , with varying the transmission parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the arrow in the figure represents the expected peak position for @xmath43 corresponding to the period @xmath45 .",
    "the inset is a magnified view of the main peak for the case of @xmath30 .",
    "log - log plots of the local recurrence - time distributions of large avalanches of their size @xmath27 for a fixed range parameter @xmath33 , with varying the transmission parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the arrow in the figure represents the expected peak position for @xmath43 corresponding to the period @xmath45 .",
    "the inset is a magnified view of the main peak for the case of @xmath30 . ]    as can be seen from fig.3 , in the longer time regime @xmath46 , @xmath35 exhibits behaviors close to power laws @xcite , whereas the deviation from the power law becomes appreciable when one approaches the conservation limit .",
    "hence , in earthquake recurrence of the model , the characteristic or periodic feature , _",
    "i.e. _ , a sharp peak in @xmath35 at @xmath41 , and the critical feature , _",
    "i.e. _ , power - law - like behaviors of @xmath35 at @xmath46 , coexist .",
    "note that , while the peak at @xmath41 is sharp , it is not infinitely sharp with a finite intrinsic width as shown in the inset of fig.3 .",
    "the peak has an asymmetric shape with a tail on shorter-@xmath34 side .",
    "furthermore , as was already noticed in ref.@xcite , the periodic events contributing to a sharp peak of @xmath35 ( `` peak events '' ) possess a power - law - like size distribution very much similar to those observed for other aperiodic events .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.4 , where the size distribution of the peak events is given for the case of @xmath47 , in comparison with the one for general events of @xmath27 .",
    "( at this @xmath13-value , @xmath47 , a slight excess is discernible at larger @xmath21 as was already noticed in fig.1 above , both for all events and for the peak events . ) in that sense , the peak events certainly appear to be characteristic in time , but not necessarily so in their size .    .",
    "the transmission parameter is @xmath47 .",
    "the peak event is defined here as an event of its size greater than @xmath27 with its recurrence time belonging to the main peak of the local recurrence - time distribution function @xmath35 given in fig.3 . ]",
    "the fact that the peak events possess a power - law like broad distribution in their size @xmath21 also explains our observation of fig.3 that the computed @xmath35 exhibits a multi - peak structure consisting of sub - peaks located at multiples of @xmath48 .",
    "reflecting such a size distribution of peaks events , many peak events occur with their size above our size threshold @xmath37 slightly .",
    "in such a situation , the `` next '' event occurring at @xmath41 after the first one might occur with its size slightly below the threshold @xmath37 , and the `` second - next '' event occurring @xmath49 after the first one might be counted as the next event in measuring the local recurrence time ( remember that the peak in @xmath35 has a small but finite width ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the major cause of the multi - peak structure of @xmath35 was ascribed to the one associated with the range parameter @xmath39 , but we now have found that the major cause of the multi - peak structure of @xmath35 is the one associated with the size threshold @xmath37 rather than with the range parameter @xmath39 : refer also to our analysis of the asperity characteristics in  4 .    we have examined whether there exists appreciable difference between the peak events and the other events with regard to their aftershock / foreshock properties . however , both types of events accompany very much similar omori - law - type aftershock / foreshock sequences . concerning their aftershock / foreshock sequences",
    ", we can not identify any appreciable difference between the peak events and the other events .    in fig.5",
    ", we show for several @xmath13-values the time - averaged stress distribution in the steady state @xmath50 averaged over all sites of the lattice .",
    "though the system is loaded with a constant rate , the stress distribution is not uniform in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] .",
    "rather , for the case of @xmath51 , @xmath50 exhibits distinct steps . for @xmath51 ,",
    "these steps appear at appropriate multiples of the transmission parameter @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath52 for @xmath53 and at @xmath54 for @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being an integer . for larger @xmath57 , no step seems to appear at multiples of @xmath13 , but @xmath50 still exhibits a noticeable structure . in this sense , the stress distribution also exhibits a characteristic feature .",
    "such a structure in @xmath50 is likely to be originated from large - scale avalanches .    .",
    "in fact , the peak events , or near - periodic events , are closely related to the asperity - like phenomena @xcite .",
    "the asperity represents a cluster of sites which ruptures simultaneously in a given avalanche , repeating many times with the same epicenter site and with almost the same period @xmath58 corresponding to the peak of the local recurrence - time distribution function @xmath35 .",
    "we show in fig.6 typical snapshots of the stress distribution immediately before and after an asperity event for the case of @xmath59 . within the asperity region ,",
    "uniform stress state is formed before the rupture giving rise to a synchronized simultaneous rupture .",
    "then , a discontinuous drop of the stress within a rupture zone ( asperity ) occurs before and after the avalanche .",
    "in fact , the same cluster except for a minor difference ruptures again after the time @xmath60 . such a rhythmic recurrence of rupture often repeats more than ten times .",
    "there is a clear tendency that such `` repeating times '' of the asperity sequence tend to be greater for smaller @xmath13 . in particular , the asperity - like phenomena themselves hardly exist near the conservation limit ( remember that the local recurrence - time distribution @xmath35 shown in fig.3 no longer exhibits a peak at @xmath43 ) .    ; ( a ) immediately before a large event at time @xmath61 , ( b ) immediately after this event , ( c ) immediately before the following event which occurs at time @xmath62 , and ( d ) immediately after this second event .",
    "two events are of size @xmath63 and @xmath64 on a @xmath65 lattice .",
    "the region surrounded by red bold lines represents the rupture zone , while the star symbol represents an epicenter site which is located at the tip of the rupture zone . ]",
    "the stress distribution in the asperity region tends to be `` discretized '' to certain values . in fig.7(a ) and ( b ) , we show for the case of @xmath30 the stress distribution @xmath50 of the asperity sites immediately before ( a ) and after ( b ) an avalanche , averaged over asperity events .",
    "we define here the asperity as a ruptured cluster of its size @xmath27 belonging to the peak event of the local recurrence - time distribution function . as can be seen from the figure",
    ", @xmath50 now consists of several `` spikes '' located at appropriate multiples of the transmission parameter @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath54 before the rupture and at @xmath52 after the rupture , with @xmath56 being an integer .",
    "one can now see that the structure found in the time - averaged stress distribution function shown in fig.5 is originated from those spikes associated with the asperity event .",
    "of each site contained in the rupture zone of the asperity event , just before ( a ) and after ( b ) the asperity event .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in fact , such a tendency of `` quantization '' or `` spikes '' also exists in the non - asperity events as well , but in a less pronounced manner . in fig.8 , we show the stress distribution at the time of toppling of each site contained in the rupture zone for both cases of the asperity events and the non - asperity events . the stress at the time of toppling generally exceeds the threshold value @xmath5 ( except for an epicenter site where it is identically unity ) .",
    "as can be seen from fig.8 , the stress value at the time of toppling is more concentrated on the threshold value @xmath5 for the asperity events than that for the non - asperity events , the latter exhibiting a broader tail toward larger values of @xmath66 .",

    "the rupture zone of both types of events , which occur in a time period of one @xmath60 , are shown together with the epicenter site of the asperity events .",
    "fig.(a ) corresponds to the midst of the `` asperity period '' where the frequency of the asperity events takes its maximum , while fig.(b ) corresponds to the midst of the `` non - asperity period '' where the frequency of the asperity events takes its minimum . as can be seen from fig.13(a ) , the asperity events tend to cluster spatially : in particular , the epicenter site of the asperity event , which tends to lie at the tip or at the corner of the rupture zone , is contiguous either to the rupture zone of other asperity events or to the area of no ( small ) events , but not contiguous to the rupture zone of non - asperity events .",
    "since the multi - toppling rarely occurs in the model , this observation means that the stress the epicenter site of the asperity event receives from its neighboring sites tends to be nearly equal to @xmath13 .",
    "there also exists a tendency that the asperity cluster lies in the interior of the lattice rather than near the boundary , as was already noticed in ref.@xcite .    in the `` non - asperity period '' , by contrast",
    ", large events are dominated almost exclusively by the non - asperity events : see fig.13(b ) . since the number of the non - asperity events is more or less kept constant in time as can be seen from fig.12 , the size of the non - asperity cluster tends to get larger in the non - asperity period , which seems consistent with the pattern observed in fig.13(b ) .",
    "in the following , we shall concentrate on the asperity events .",
    "an epicenter site topples at the beginning of a given event releasing its stress to zero . if the epicenter site @xmath4 is of the type @xmath75 ( @xmath82 ) , it receives the stress from its nearest - neighbor sites @xmath75 times during this asperity event . since any toppling in the asperity event occurs close to the borderline stress @xmath5 , the stress value the epicenter site receives during this event is equal to @xmath83 .",
    "as mentioned , in asperity events , the same site @xmath4 is likely to be an epicenter of the next event again , _",
    "i.e. _ , reaches the threshold stress @xmath5 earlier than any other site in the rupture zone of this event .",
    "this might sound a bit surprising at first , since , as shown in fig.11 , an epicenter site tends to be located at the tip position of the rupture zone with @xmath76 , which means that the epicenter site is in a low stress state just after the preceding event .",
    "however , such an epicenter site rapidly develops its stress not only by stress loading but also by receiving stress via the topplings of its @xmath84 nearest - neighbor sites not belonging to the rupture zone of the preceding event . here",
    "recall that the stress transfer the epicenter site @xmath4 receives from the nearest - neighbor sites during the interval time tend to be nearly equal to @xmath13 .",
    "then , one can see the reason why the same epicenter site becomes an epicenter of the next asperity event again .",
    "the stress the epicenter site @xmath4 receives from the one - site events ( or other asperity events ) during the interval time is equal to @xmath85 so that the time needed for the site @xmath4 to reach the threshold stress @xmath5 is @xmath86 , which is just the interval time of the asperity events observed in the local recurrence - time distribution .",
    "next , let us consider the stress at an arbitrary site @xmath4 in the rupture zone other than the epicenter site .",
    "we suppose that , during a given asperity event , @xmath87 among @xmath75 nearest - neighbor sites topple before the site @xmath4 and the remaining @xmath88 nearest - neighbor sites topple after the site @xmath4 . by definition ,",
    "then , the stress at the site @xmath4 just after the asperity event is @xmath90 .",
    "the stress the site @xmath4 receives during the interval time from the sites not belonging to the rupture zone of the preceding event is @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the time needed for the site @xmath4 to reach the threshold stress @xmath5 is @xmath91 , which is always greater than the corresponding time for the epicenter site estimated above , @xmath17 , since @xmath92 . thus , an epicenter site of the preceding asperity event tends to be an epicenter of the next asperity event again .",
    "one sees that the value of @xmath75 does not matter in the proof given above .",
    "therefore , our observation in fig.11 that a tip ( or a corner ) site tends to be an epicenter of the avalanche can not be explained solely from the above argument . at the moment",
    ", we do not know the reason why an epicenter site tends to lie at the tip or the corner of the rupture zone rather than in its interior in the ofc model , though the tendency is quite distinct in our numerical simulation .    .",
    "fig.(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to the time @xmath61 ( a ) , @xmath93 ( b ) and @xmath94 ( c ) .",
    "the region surrounded by the red bold line represents the rupture zone of the first event .",
    "]    the asperity events repeat over many times , but they do not last forever .",
    "after all , our model is a spatially uniform model so that no interior site can be special in the long - time limit .",
    "then , we also study the manner how the asperity sequence is interrupted . for the asperity sequence interruption , there seem to be two patterns .",
    "the first pattern is a detachment of the asperity .",
    "namely , one big asperity is divided into two parts , each of which collapse not at the same time , but at different times , though still mutually close in time .",
    "an example of this pattern is given in fig.14 .",
    "the second pattern is an enlargement of the asperity .",
    "namely , a given asperity event gets involved in other larger event becoming a part of it , which can occur when the asperity fails to rupture at the regular period @xmath48 due to some reason .",
    "an example of the latter pattern is given in fig.15 .    .",
    "fig.(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to the time @xmath61 ( a ) , @xmath95 ( b ) and @xmath96 ( c ) .",
    "the region surrounded by the red bold line represents the rupture zone of the first event . ]",
    "we studied the properties of the ofc model of earthquakes . in this model ,",
    "characteristic and critical properties coexist in an intriguing manner .",
    "we computed the magnitude distribution , the recurrence - time distribution , the stress distribution , and investigated various asperity characteristics in some detail .",
    "interestingly , the ofc model exhibits not only well - known critical features like the gr law and the omori law , but also pronounced characteristic or periodic features , most notably exemplified in the occurrence of asperity - like phenomena .",
    "we have found that the stress dissipation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the non - conservation of the stress , is essential for the asperity - like phenomena to occur .",
    "we have also shown that a key ingredient in the asperity formation is a self - organization of the highly concentrated stress state .",
    "such a stress concentration immediately explains why the interval time of the asperity events is equal to @xmath17 , and why the same site becomes an epicenter in the asperity sequence .",
    "the asperity - like events in the ofc model closely resemble those familiar in seismology @xcite , in the sense that almost the same spatial region ruptures repeatedly with a common epicenter site and with a common period .    indeed , apparent coexistence of critical and characteristic features is a notable feature of real earthquake phenomena as well .",
    "the critical features are most typically seen in various power - laws observed in statistical properties of earthquakes , _",
    "e.g. _ , the gr law and the omori law as described .",
    "typical examples of characteristic features of real earthquakes may be , _ e.g. _ , the asperities observed along the subduction zone in northeastern japan , particularly repeating earthquakes off kamaishi @xcite . in seismology , the concept of earthquake cycles has been used in long - term probabilistic earthquake forecasts @xcite .",
    "thus , the ofc model , though an extremely simplified model , may capture some of the essential ingredients necessary to understand apparent coexistence of critical and characteristic properties in real earthquakes . in seismology , the origin of the asperity is usually ascribed to possible inhomogeneity in the material property of the crust or in the external conditions .",
    "we wish to stress here , however , that in the present ofc model there is no built - in inhomogeneity in the model parameters nor in the external conditions , yet the `` asperity '' is self - generated from the spatially uniform evolution - rule and the model parameter .",
    "as mentioned , the asperity in the ofc model is not a permanent one .",
    "after all , the model is spatially uniform .",
    "meanwhile , we have observed that the asperity events tend to cluster both in time and in space . in particular , the asperity events exhibit `` active '' and `` calm '' periods in turn . in its active period ,",
    "the asperity often exists stably over many earthquake recurrences .",
    "thus , one needs to keep in mind a possibility that , even in the asperity formation of real seismicity , inhomogeneity might play only a secondary role .",
    "of course , real crust is certainly inhomogeneous , and it is important to clarify how such inhomogeneity affects , or does not affect , the critical and the characteristic properties of earthquakes . in this context , it might be interesting to study the corresponding properties of the _ inhomogeneous _ ofc model in comparison with those of the present homogeneous ofc model . among others ,",
    "the question whether the asperity - like phenomena and the associated characteristic properties would survive the build - in inhomogeneity or not is of particular interest .",
    "the answer to this question seems to be `` yes '' , although some of the properties change from the ones observed for the present homogeneous model and its details often depend on the specific parameter the model .",
    "the properties of such inhomogeneous ofc model will be reported in our forthcoming publication @xcite .",

    "first , we look at the site @xmath8 which is the nearest neighbor of an epicenter site 0 .",
    "let the stress of the site @xmath8 be @xmath97 .",
    "we assume @xmath98 , which is equivalent to assuming that this site topples nearly at its threshold value @xmath5 . among the four nearest - neighbor sites of the site @xmath8 ,",
    "one is an epicenter 0 .",
    "the epicenter site always topples at @xmath99 and distribute the stress @xmath13 to its nearest - neighbor sites including @xmath8 .",
    "let the stress of other three nearest - neighbor sites of the site @xmath8 be @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) : see fig.16 .",
    "after the toppling of the epicenter site 0 , the site @xmath8 reaches the stress @xmath102 and topples .",
    "the three nearest - neighbor sites of the site @xmath8 then reach the stress @xmath103 ( @xmath101 ) and topple .",
    "the site @xmath8 then receives the stress from the sites 1 , 2 , and 3 , reaching the stress @xmath104 .",
    "as long as the site @xmath8 does not topple again in this asperity event , which is usually the case , this is the stress value at the site @xmath8 immediately after this asperity event .",
    "after the interseismic period @xmath48 , the stress at the site @xmath8 becomes @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "then , the condition of the stress concentration occurring at the site @xmath8 is @xmath107 .",
    "namely , as the asperity events repeat , the stress at the time of toppling gradually approaches the threshold value @xmath5 if the condition @xmath108 is fulfilled .",
    "now , we extend the above discussion to more general situation where , among the four nearest - neighbor sites of the site @xmath8 , ( i ) one site 0 topples before the site @xmath8 and three other sites 1,2 and 3 topple after the site @xmath8 . here",
    "we consider the site @xmath8 to be an interior site with all its nearest - neighbor sites contained in the rupture zone of the asperity event .",
    "let the stress of the site @xmath8 be @xmath97 as above , the stress of the site toppling before @xmath8 be @xmath109 , and the ones after @xmath8 be @xmath110 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "after the toppling of the site @xmath111 , the site @xmath8 reaches the stress @xmath112 and topples .",
    "the three neighboring sites 1 , 2 and 3 then reach the stress @xmath113 ( @xmath101 ) and topple .",
    "the site @xmath8 then receive the stress from the sites 1,2 , and 3 , reaching the stress @xmath114 . as long as the site @xmath8",
    "does not topple again in this asperity event , which is usually the case , this is the stress value at the site @xmath8 just after this asperity event .",
    "after the period @xmath48 , the stress at the site @xmath8 becomes @xmath115 .",
    "then , the condition of the stress concentration occurring at the site @xmath8 is @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    ", plotted versus the transmission parameter @xmath13 in the case of @xmath118 .",
    "the three processes ( i ) @xmath119 ( iii ) are described in the text .",
    "one can see that the stress concentration process , expected at @xmath120 , is readily operative in most cases , since @xmath121 is large except for the process ( i ) close to the conservation limit @xmath32 . ]",
    "one can repeat similar discussion to the other cases where , among the four nearest - neighbor sites of the site @xmath8 , ( ii ) two sites 0 and 1 topple before the site @xmath8 and the two other sites 2 and 3 topple after the site @xmath8 , ( iii ) three sites 0 , 1 and 2 topple before the site @xmath8 and one other site 3 topples after the site @xmath8 , and ( iv ) all four sites topple after the site @xmath8 . in the case ( ii ) , the condition of the stress concentration is @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in the case ( iii ) , the condition of the stress concentration is @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the case ( iv ) is exceptional , where the stress of the site @xmath8 after the event is always zero .",
    "the @xmath13-dependence of @xmath121 is shown in fig.17 in the above cases of ( i ) @xmath119 ( iii ) with @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath121-value is rather insensitive to the @xmath128-value , since , in the expression of @xmath121 , the coefficient of the @xmath128-term is smaller than the leading term by factor of @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "the above analysis indicates that , once each site starts to topple more or less at similar stress values close to the threshold value @xmath5 , this tendency is more and more evolved as the asperity events repeat , _",
    "i.e. _ , the stress concentration tends to be self - organized ."
