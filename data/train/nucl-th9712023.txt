    "the photodisintegration of @xmath1h and @xmath2he and the inverse reaction , the radiative capture of protons or neutrons by deuterons , have been intensively investigated in the past . due to the fact that the corresponding matrix elements contain both the three - body bound and continuum states",
    ", these reactions are expected to be a good testing ground for the underlying two - body potential . in early calculations by barbour and phillips",
    "@xcite it has been shown that an exact treatment of the continuum states results in a considerable enhancement of the cross section in the peak region . in that work and in the following by gibson and lehman",
    "@xcite only simple @xmath3-wave interactions of yamaguchi type have been used , while @xmath4-components @xmath5 were incorporated in @xcite . the role of @xmath6-wave contributions in the two - body input with respect to the three - body cross section",
    "was investigated by fonseca and lehman @xcite , using again yamaguchi terms in the interaction .",
    "more recently , calculations based on separable representations of the bonn _ a _ and paris potentials , including their higher partial wave contributions , were performed for polarization observables at some specific energies @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the differential cross sections at @xmath7 for the yamaguchi , malfliet - tjon , paris , and bonn _ b _ potentials over an energy region from threshold up to @xmath8 mev . the potential dependence , the effect of higher partial waves , and the role of meson exchange currents , taken into account via siegert s theorem , are investigated .",
    "technically the calculations are based on the faddeev - type alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) formalism @xcite adjusted to photonuclear processes @xcite , as done already in @xcite .",
    "the separable representation of the subsystem _",
    "matrices , relevant in this context , is chosen according to the _",
    "w_-matrix approach @xcite .",
    "this approximation combines high accuracy with considerable simplicity @xcite .    a more reliable , still fairly simple representation of the two - body input is provided by the ernst - shakin - thaler method @xcite .",
    "calculations employing the corresponding pest , best , and nest potentials @xcite will be presented in a subsequent publication .",
    "the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations are well known to go over into effective two - body lippmann - schwinger equations @xcite when representing the input two - body",
    "_ t_-operators in separable form .",
    "the neutron - deuteron off - shell scattering amplitude @xmath9 , thus , is determined by    @xmath10    applying the same technique to the photodisintegration of the triton into neutron and deuteron , i.e. to the process @xmath11 , an integral equation of rather similar structure is obtained @xcite ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 represents an off - shell extension of the full photodisintegration amplitude    @xmath14    in both these equations the kernel is given by the effective neutron - deuteron potential @xmath15 and the corresponding effective free green function @xmath16 defined in ref .",
    "however , in eq .",
    "( [ pampl ] ) the inhomogeneity of eq .",
    "( [ scampl ] ) is replaced by an off - shell extension @xmath17 of the plane - wave ( born ) amplitude    @xmath18    here @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the triton and deuteron states , @xmath21 the momentum state of the neutron relative to the center of mass of the deuteron , and @xmath22 the electromagnetic operator .",
    "thus , by this replacement any working program for @xmath23@xmath4 scattering can immediately be applied to the above photoprocess .",
    "the results presented in this paper are , in fact , obtained by extending recent @xmath23@xmath4 calculations @xcite in this manner . as in these references , the separable part of the _ w_-matrix representation @xcite of the two - body _ t _",
    "matrices is employed ,    @xmath24    here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the orbital angular momenta , and @xmath27 stands for the spin , the angular momentum j [ with the coupling sequence @xmath28 and the isospin @xmath29 of the two - body subsystem . with the form factors @xmath30 and the propagators @xmath31 of this representation eq .",
    "( [ pampl ] ) reads , after partial wave decomposition and antisymmetrization ,    @xmath32    and its inhomogeneity is given by    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the free three - body green function and the partial wave projection of the three - body plane wave state @xmath36 .",
    "the detailed structure of the effective potential @xmath37 can be found in ref .",
    "the label @xmath38 denotes the set @xmath39 of quantum numbers , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the channel spin of the three nucleons [ with the coupling sequence @xmath42 and the relative angular momentum between the two - body subsystem and the third particle , respectively .",
    "@xmath43 is the total angular momentum following from the coupling sequence @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the total isospin .",
    "the born amplitude contains the triton bound state @xmath46 , which may be calculated by any of the various bound - state methods . consistently with the present approach we employ for this purpose the partial wave projected homogeneous version of eq .",
    "( [ scampl ] ) ,    @xmath47    its solutions , the three - body `` form - factors '' @xmath48 , are related to @xmath46 according to @xcite by    @xmath49    here , the summation runs over all two - fragment partitions @xmath50 , the variables and quantum numbers being understood in the corresponding set of jacobi coordinates .",
    "the electromagnetic operator entering eq .",
    "( [ bampl ] ) is , at the low energies considered , essentially a dipole operator . ignoring meson - exchange currents it is given by    @xmath51    with exchange currents it takes , according to siegert s theorem @xcite , the form @xcite",
    "@xmath52    here @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the final and the triton energies , @xmath55 the nucleon center - of - mass coordinates , @xmath56 the corresponding momenta , @xmath57 the electric charges , and @xmath58 the polarization of the photon .",
    "the on - shell restricted solutions @xmath59 of the integral eq .",
    "( [ phampl ] ) yield the photodisintegration amplitude via the partial - wave summation    @xmath60    where now , in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ mampl ] ) , the spin and angular momentum quantum numbers of the neutron ( @xmath61 ) , deuteron ( @xmath62 ) , triton ( @xmath63 ) , and the polarization ( @xmath58 ) of the photon are explicitly given . denoting this amplitude by @xmath64 ,",
    "the cross section is obtained in the standard way by    @xmath65    here we have averaged over the initial states and summed over the final states .",
    "as a first test of our numerical program we performed calculations for the yamaguchi @xcite potential in order to compare them with the corresponding results by gibson and lehman @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , employing the same sets of parameters as in this reference , we read off from the analytically given relations somewhat different values for the two - body scattering length , effective range , and deuteron binding energy ( table i ) .",
    "the triton binding energies , obtained by solving the homogeneous three - body equations , differ in one case , the symmetric tabakin potential , where we found @xmath66mev instead of @xmath67mev ( table iii ) .",
    "these discrepancies mean that our photodisintegration results can not be expected to fully agree with the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure 1 compares our cross sections for triton - photodisintegration ( solid line ) with the calculations by gibson and lehman @xcite ( dashed line ) .",
    "the disagreement , in particular in the peak region , is reduced when replacing in the siegert operator our triton energy by the gibson - lehman value ( short - dashed line ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the same comparison , but now for the @xmath68he photodisintegration . since there is no disagreement between the @xmath68he binding energies",
    ", a correspondingly modified curve does not exist .",
    "the remaining discrepancies , therefore , have to be attributed to numerical uncertainties , which are not unexpected in view of the level of accuracy reached in early calculations . within these limits",
    "we consider our results for the yamaguchi potential consistent with the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections obtained for the paris @xcite , bonn _ b _",
    "@xcite , malfliet - tjon ( mt i - iii ) @xcite , and yamaguchi potentials are shown in figure 3 .",
    "most remarkable is the strong potential dependence in the peak region , which vanishes at higher energies .",
    "a further observation , which should be relevant in model calculations or when going over to higher particle numbers @xcite , is the proximity of the paris and malfliet - tjon results on the one hand , and less closely the bonn _",
    "b _ and yamaguchi potentials on the other hand .    in figure 4",
    "we contrast , for the paris potential , the solution of the integral equation ( solid line ) with the corresponding plane - wave ( born ) approximation ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is seen that the full solution is enhanced by about 24% at the peak .",
    "a similar enhancement was observed for simpler interactions already in ref .",
    "the upper curves are the ones based on the siegert - operator ( [ sieg2 ] ) , the lower ones correspond to the non - siegert operator ( [ sieg1 ] ) .",
    "there is a factor of two between the siegert and non - siegert results , which demonstrates the relevance of meson - exchange currents . for a detailed discussion of the same phenomenon in case of deuteron and @xmath69he photodisintegration",
    "we refer to refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "figures 5 and 6 compare our cross sections for the s- and d - wave projected paris and bonn _ b _ potentials with the data from refs .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show the same with inclusion of the subsystem @xmath6 waves , which leads to a reduction of the peak by 810% . up to 25 mev the best agreement with the data is achieved for the bonn _",
    "b _ potential . in view of the experimental errors",
    "the relevance of this observation is , of course , somewhat questionable . at higher energies the potential dependence vanishes .",
    "it is , however , seen that the incorporation of the @xmath6 waves is essential for the remarkable agreement with most recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "note that for the inverse reaction the relevance of the @xmath6 wave contributions has been pointed out also in @xcite .",
    "two fragment photodisintegration of the three - nucleon bound states , thus , provides a sensitive tool for testing the underlying two - nucleon potentials . a repetition of the corresponding low - energy measurements with much higher accuracy is strongly suggested by this observation ."
