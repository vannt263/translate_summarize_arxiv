    "the pseudopotential then scales as @xmath13 and the potential energy felt by an assembly of ions can thus be written as @xmath14 where we have denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 the distances of ion @xmath17 to the center of the trap and to particle @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the previous equation can be removed by scaling of the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . in the following ,",
    "reduced units are thus chosen for both distances and energies , which amounts to using @xmath24 in eq .",

    "the ions arrange into a single spherical thin shell for @xmath26 , and two shells above this size .",
    "this shell structure can be fruitfully used to predict the minima for larger clouds , assuming that the radial density is written as a sum over @xmath27 concentric shells of zero thickness .",
    "such a shell model was initially developed for the quadrupole trap @xcite and improved for intra - shell correlations @xcite .",
    "the energy to be minimized , @xmath28 , is a function of the radii @xmath29 of the shells , each shell @xmath17 carrying @xmath30 ions ( plus one possible ion at the center , @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 in the above equation , we have denoted by @xmath33 the intra - shell coulomb energy in which the particles lie on the unit sphere .",

    "energies and radii obtained from the tabulated thomson minima are in very good agreement with the exact results until two shells are formed above 100 ions .",
    "the agreement is not as good when the asymptotic form for the thomson energies is used , the energy being slightly underestimated .",
    "this underestimation suggests that the value of the parameter @xmath38 used in the shell model , which was taken from extrapolations of the thomson model to the large sizes regime @xcite , may be slightly excessive at small sizes .",
    "the greater validity of the current value of @xmath38 to large sizes is also indicated by the relative error between the shell energy and the monte carlo data , which for the systems considered in table  [ table ] decreases from 0.5% to less than 0.01% as the number of ions increases from 10 to 200 . despite this systematic error",
    ", we generally find that the exact energy obtained by minimization lies inbetween the predictions of the two shell models , and that the outer radius is correctly reproduced ( within 0.2% ) by both models .    at this point , it is important to stress that the agreement between the shell models and global optimization is essentially due to the correct account of correlations , which are implicitly included in the thomson energies @xmath43 or explicitly in the asymptotic expression of eq  ( [ eq : easympt ] ) through the term @xmath44 .",
    "for comparison , the mean - field treatment predicts that the structure of the 100-ion cluster would have 9 shells .",
    "the asymptotic shell model can be further exploited in the larger sizes regime @xmath45 , where the optimal thomson energies are not systematically available .",
    "the shell radii predicted by this model are represented as a function of the number of ions in fig .",

    "however , the cloud radius ( outermost shell ) and the minimum energy are both accurately reproduced .",
    "one prediction of the continuous shell model is the size at which new shells appear .",
    "in contrast with the quadrupole case , where shells are essentially added over an existing core @xcite , shells for octupole clusters grow both on the outside and on the inside . the shell capacitance",
    "may then be defined as the maximum number of ions that a shell can sustain , and above which a new shell appears .",

    "the model also predicts that the @xmath57-ion cluster should have 17 shells but , as will be seen below , structural minimization yields a more contrasted picture .",
    "these transitions occur at much larger sizes than in the quadrupole case @xcite , where for instance the 13- and 58-ion clusters adopt the ( 1,12 ) and ( 1,12,45 ) shell structures , respectively @xcite .     scaling law .",

    "the thomson shell model also performs rather well for predicting structures of clusters containing two shells .",
    "this agreement suggests to use the known thomson minima for optimizing the atomic structure of multishell systems as well , as long as all shells remain very thin .",
    "such an idea is also supported by a recent investigation by cioslowski on a modified but similar thomson model @xcite .",
    "we have guided monte carlo global minimization by combining the results of the shell model with the available solutions to the thomson problem @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the continuous shell model is used to predict the optimal number of layers and the individual numbers of ions per layer ( the discrete shell model could also be used ) .",
    "the coordinates of the ions in each layer are then scaled from the corresponding solution to the thomson problem to have a radius given by the predictions of the shell model , and the only remaining degrees of freedom are two euler angles @xmath58 for each layer .",
    "the new monte carlo optimization consists thus in first locating the low - energy regions in these angles space , and to locally minimize the resulting structures by relaxing all ionic positions .",
    "this method was found to perform very satisfactorily with respect to brute force basin - hopping minimization for several sizes in the range @xmath591000 , leading to low - energy structures often identical , or higher but by only a few @xmath60 percents .    provided that correlations are included in the evaluation of @xmath61 ,",
    "the above results show that the combined shell+monte carlo optimization should be especially useful for large systems , for which successful basin - hopping runs would be prohibitive , and this even allowed us to explore clusters containing up to @xmath62 ions . at large sizes , fig .",
    "[ fig : shell ] shows that the cloud radius @xmath63 and its minimum energy @xmath64 scale as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . both scaling laws readily follow from a simple cold fluid approximation , which is expected to be valid for large sizes @xcite .",
    "the maximum radius @xmath63 of the cloud naturally relates to the total number @xmath1 of ions through a @xmath67 radial density . for the energy @xmath64",
    ", the coulomb and trapping components are related to each other through the virial theorem as @xmath68 at any local minimum configuration where the gradient vanishes .",
    "hence @xmath64 is proportional to the trapping energy only , which is simply integrated over the radial density @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "the validity of the cold fluid theory is better manifested on the radial effective density profile . from the stable ionic configurations obtained for the sizes",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath715 , we have calculated the minimum pair distance @xmath72 between a given ion @xmath17 and all other ions @xmath18 , which is related to the local density @xmath69 through @xmath73 . fig .  [",
    "fig : density ] shows the correlation between this quantity and the radial distance @xmath15 of ion @xmath17 for the three sizes .",

    "[ fig : density ] is the broadening of the shells when the number of ions increases from @xmath76 to @xmath0 , especially noticeable for the inner shells . above a few thousands of ions ( an estimate based on mixed shell / thomson optimization yields @xmath77 ) ,",
    "this broadening is sufficient for some shells to overlap into a more continuous radial distribution of ions below the outermost layer , which is the only one to remain thin , even for the largest size considered , @xmath62 .",
    "this mixed continuous / discrete behavior is better seen on the accumulated fraction @xmath78 of ions inside a sphere of radius @xmath11 .",
    "the variations of @xmath79 with increasing @xmath11 , depicted as an inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] , exhibit spectacular changes as the size reaches @xmath0 .",
    "the sharp steps found in small clouds or at large radii are characteristic of new shells , but are progressively softened in the inner regions of the @xmath0-ion system and even replaced by a nearly continuous profile in the largest cluster . in an octupole trap , crystallization",
    "should then be understood as the formation of an outermost thin layer with a softer , decreasingly dense but thick inner layer .",
    "surface effects , which play a major role in reducing the melting point of ion clouds in harmonic potentials @xcite , could thus have a very different influence in the case of the octupole trap .",
    "whereas the previous section considered the stable structures and static issues , we now discuss the thermodynamical and dynamical behavior of selected ion clusters in octupole traps .",
    "classical md simulations have been carried out at various energies to compute several thermodynamical and structural observables .",
    "order / disorder transitions have been monitored using the root mean square bond length fluctuation or lindemann index @xmath80 , as well as the particle - resolved diffusion constant @xmath81 from the integrated velocity autocorrelation function .",

    "[ fig : delta ] , the global melting of the 512-ion system can therefore be located near @xmath84 .",
    "however , the additional lindemann indices clearly reveal that the interior shell exhibits some preliminary softening already above @xmath85 before fully melting near @xmath86 .",
    "melting of this inner shell impacts the distance fluctuations within the other shells , as seen from the slight increase in the corresponding lindemann indices .",
    "however , these shells clearly undergo their own distinct melting transitions at @xmath87 ( second shell ) and @xmath88 ( outermost shell ) .",
    "the intershell lindemann index follows similar variations as the intrashell index of the intermediate , second shell .",
    "this agreement is not fortuitous : melting of the second shell occurs while the interior shell is already disordered , and the present results show that these two shells tend to mix , to some extent , while the outermost layer remains rigid .",
    "the melting mechanisms can be analysed in more details by looking at the ions motion at various temperatures .",
    "the correlations between the average radial distance @xmath89 and the diffusion constant @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomr ] for the 2048-ion system at four characteristic temperatures . for this system ,",
    "the melting point obtained from the variations of the global lindemann index lies near @xmath90 . at @xmath91 , the four shells are clearly seen as narrow vertical spots with low values for @xmath81 at radii close to 1.32 , 1.68 , 1.97 , and 2.20 .",
    "the intershell motion and occasional hops of ions between neighboring shells are seen at @xmath92 , they are associated with a much higher diffusion constant . note that @xmath81 exhibit a steady decrease with the radial distance , in agreement with the previously found softening of internal layers . at @xmath93",
    "the global diffusivity is also higher , and the shell structure seems essentially lost .",
    "a similar trend is found at the highest temperature considered here , @xmath94 , with a single broad spot centered around a radius of 2.02 .",
    "the peculiar core melting effect is a consequence of the lower density of the inner shells , and is similar in this respect to the general surface melting process in solid state and nanoscale materials @xcite . at first sight",
    ", this phenomenon may preclude from unambiguously defining the melting temperature of the entire system since , strictly speaking , the system is not yet fully melted when the global lindemann index barely exceeds 0.15 .",
    "however , because the relative number of ions in the external regions grows with size as @xmath95 according to the cold fluid model , the definition of the global index @xmath80 should reflect more and more closely the value of the outermost layer .",
    "the melting point @xmath96 was thus defined for all sizes as the temperature at which @xmath80 exceeds 0.15 . for the present clouds in octupole traps ,",
    "the variations of @xmath96 have been represented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] as a function of inverse cluster radius .",
    "not surprisingly , fluctuations are seen at small sizes , and the 32-ion system ( @xmath97 ) seems extra resistant to melting relative to its neighboring sizes .",
    "since the 31- and 33-ion systems have a much lower melting point , the special stability of the 32-ion cluster indicates a magic character , further confirmed by its high icosahedral symmetry . as @xmath1 reaches 256 ( @xmath98 ) , @xmath96 increases linearly as the inverse radius decreases .",
    "this linear depression , though not anticipated for these highly heterogeneous , core - melted systems , allows some straightforward extrapolating to the infinite size limit @xmath99 , leading to @xmath100 . even though it is hard to figure out what a cloud confined in an octupole trap",
    "would physically represent at the bulk limit , the present simulation results should be very useful for estimating melting temperatures in system sizes of the order of @xmath57 or more , as experimentally studied in other groups @xcite .",
    "despite their obvious differences , ion clouds in octupole and quadrupole confinements share several remarkable features .",
    "firstly , the onset of the transition from a multishell structure to the bcc wigner crystal in quadrupole trap was estimated to be around @xmath0 ions @xcite . in octupole",
    "traps the shell structure becomes blurred above a few thousands of ions .",
    "secondly , for both cases , the depression in the melting point with respect to the bulk limit follows a linear scaling with inverse cluster radius @xcite .",
    "thirdly , in small systems , a clear differential melting between the inner and outer shells seems to take place in both confinements .",
    "these similarities may well extend past the specific octupole trap , hold also in higher - order traps , and even be universal . as the exponent @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phitot ] ) takes higher integer values , the stable shell structure should be qualitatively preserved , only with fewer shells . therefore the transition to a softened core",
    "should be delayed as @xmath102 increases , but one can not exclude that the same melting mechanisms will remain , and in particular that the melting temperature will display linear variations with inverse radius .    because ion clouds in octupole traps remain poorly studied , the present work could be extended along many lines . keeping the isotropic case as a model of a more realistic three - dimensional trap , it would be interesting to examine more specifically dynamical properties involving the vibrations and normal modes @xcite or the transitions between regular and chaotic regimes @xcite .",
    "extension of analytical models @xcite developed for the quadrupole case to higher - order traps would also be useful .",
    "finally , at the price of introducing additional parameters in the model , one natural step beyond the present work would be to look at clusters in linear octupole traps , such as those discussed by okada and coworkers @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "confinement along the symmetry axis is harmonic in nature , whereas confinement perpendicular to the axis is octupolar .",
    "the stable structures are hollow tubes of ions @xcite , and it is unclear how the combined contributions of the harmonic and octupolar confinements will determine the cluster properties . even aware of these complications , the multishell structure and core - melted phase predicted here , as well as the scaling laws connecting size , radius , and melting temperature , should all become amenable to experimental comparison in the near future .",
    "may such measurements also help us understanding the collective properties of these exotic states of coulombic matter .",
