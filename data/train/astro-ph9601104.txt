    "the occurrence of supernova 1987a in the large magellanic cloud has proven to be among the most fruitful experiments in the heavenly laboratory for confirming `` known '' physics and constraining new physics . aside from its obvious impact upon the study of the late stages of stellar evolution in general and upon supernova physics in particular , models for sn1987a have become a test bed for the study of the couplings of light particles ( neutrinos , axions ) to ordinary matter . in this work ,",
    "we discuss limits on the properties of neutrinos independent of a specific model for the supernova based upon the emission of thermal neutrinos from the hot nascent neutron star .",
    "when a supernova occurs , the bulk of the binding energy of the progenitor star ( @xmath12  erg ) is released in neutrinos , as predicted by theory and confirmed by the observation of a neutrino burst from sn1987a , with a characteristic temperature of about @xmath13 mev ( for low - mass electron neutrinos ; other species are predicted to have a higher temperature , @xmath14 , because of their different coupling to the prevalent electrons @xcite ) .",
    "if at least one species of neutrinos is unstable and couples to the photon , then some of these neutrinos will decay to photons en route , which are potentially detectable as mev gamma rays . at the time of the supernova",
    "burst s arrival at earth and environs , there were several satellites operating in the solar system capable of detecting the decay photons in the course of their watch for gamma - ray bursts .",
    "analyses of the data from one of these detectors , on board the solar max mission ( smm ) satellite , has already been presented@xcite . here , we examine the data from the gamma burst detector on the pioneer venus orbiter ( pvo ) . while the pvo detector was smaller , and its energy window is not well - matched to that of the supernova neutrinos , it had @xmath15 acceptance and was in an environment free of the earth s radiation belts ( leading to lower backgrounds ) .",
    "in addition , more high quality data is available ( @xmath16  sec vs. 10  sec for smm ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section an exact formula for the expected gamma - ray flux",
    "is derived and important approximations are developed . in section  [ sec : stat ] , the pvo data are discussed and rigorous limits are derived in the simplest regime .",
    "the next four sections build upon these results , expanding to more complicated regimes .",
    "the final section is a brief summary .",
    "we can write the expected fluence of gamma rays from decaying neutrinos with mass @xmath1 and mean lifetime @xmath17 as@xcite @xmath18\\right)dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the fraction of decays that produce a gamma ray .",
    "the first factor is the overall flux of neutrinos from a supernova at a distance @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the differential number flux of neutrinos of energy @xmath21 , so @xmath22 is the total luminosity in neutrinos .",
    "the second factor gives the fraction that decay into a `` lab - frame '' angle @xmath23 .",
    "the third factor gives the fraction that decay at time @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the delta function selects the photons with a given @xmath24 , @xmath21 , @xmath25 that arrive at a time @xmath26 after the arrival of massless neutrinos at the detector .",
    "the lorentz factor is @xmath27 and the speed @xmath28 .",
    "the function @xmath29 depends on the distribution of daughter photons in the neutrino rest frame , and therefore on the particular decay channel involved .",
    "first , we consider the two - body decay , @xmath4 .",
    "because the neutrino is a spin-1/2 particle , and the photon a spin-1 particle , this reaction can proceed in one of two ways : with the helicity of the daughter neutrino either parallel or antiparallel the initial helicity . from quantum mechanics , then , the distribution of the photon in the rest frame of the parent will be proportional to either @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the cosine of the rest - frame angle between the directions of the parent neutrino and the photon .",
    "transforming into the lab frame gives us the distribution @xmath29 .",
    "note that we have assumed the neutrinos are ejected from the supernova in an instantaneous burst ; as long as the actual duration of the pulse is small compared to the timing resolution of the detector , which is the case , this is a good approximation . because we are not interested in the decay angle , but rather the photon energy , we write @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gamma - ray energy , related to the decay angle by @xmath34 this gives @xmath35 for each of the helicity possibilities .",
    "( for reference , an isotropic decay would give @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the neutrino momentum . ) for low - mass neutrinos with @xmath38 , @xmath39 each of these should be multiplied by a heaviside function @xmath40 to require that the daughter photon be less energetic than the parent .",
    "further , we require that the decay does not occur inside of the progenitor envelope which would considerably alter the energetics of the explosion and lead to an independent constraint which is important for short lifetimes .",
    "the factor inside the delta function is especially complicated .",
    "this occurs because at any given time , the detector is receiving photons from neutrinos that have decayed in a complicated shape , approximately an ellipsoid with the supernova at one focus and the detector at another , further complicated by the speed @xmath41 of the massive neutrinos .",
    "this includes photons that have left the supernova pointing far away from the detector but have decayed at large angles toward the detector .",
    "obviously , for low mass neutrinos which leave the supernova at highly relativistic speeds , the fraction which take such a path is very small . to simplify this expression",
    ", we shall require that @xmath42  sec  most of the neutrinos decay well before they reach the earth .",
    "otherwise , the flux is greatly reduced and the limits are correspondingly weaker ; the neutrinos may typically take a path that causes them to decay well after our observations end . in sec .",
    "[ sec : long ] we discuss long lifetimes .    in this limit , the delta function becomes simply @xmath43 , and we can perform the integral over @xmath24 : @xmath44 ( similar expressions have also been derived in @xcite . ) we shall assume that the neutrino - number luminosity is given by a zero - chemical - potential fermi - dirac distribution with known temperature and total neutrino energy , a reasonable approximation@xcite .",
    "for now , we will present results for low - mass neutrinos ( , @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 where @xmath47  erg is the total energy in one species of massless neutrinos .",
    "we treat the case @xmath48 in sec .",
    "[ sec : massive ] below .",
    "finally , we can integrate the above expression over all neutrino energies @xmath21 and over one time bin from @xmath26 to @xmath49 to get an expression for the spectrum of photons incident on the detector during that time interval . for @xmath45 , @xmath50 in this expression ,",
    "the function @xmath51 results from the integral over the neutrino energies .",
    "it is of order unity for the paramater ranges of interest , and it is largest in the case of `` no flip , '' which we will assume from now on since it gives the most conservative estimates of the parameters . in that case , it is given by @xmath52 .",
    "although this signal depends nonlinearly on the parameter @xmath53 , the expression simplifies when @xmath53 is much greater or less than @xmath54 or @xmath55 , where @xmath33 is a typical photon energy , giving @xmath56 in the former case of small @xmath53 , there is no appreciable relativistic delay before the decay of the neutrinos , so essentially all of the daughter photons arrive in the first time bin after the supernova . in the case of large @xmath53 ,",
    "the flux is essentially constant over the time of the observations , so the signal is proportional to the width of the time bin .",
    "note that only in the latter case does the fluence actually depend on the value of @xmath53 .    in order to calculate the expected signal from the theoretical spectrum",
    ", we must fold that spectrum with the appropriate response function . the signal expecied in the @xmath57th energy channel",
    "is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the response of detector @xmath57 in energy bin @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the theoretical spectrum averaged over energy bin @xmath62 at time ( or time bin ) @xmath26 .",
    "this , combined with a separate observation of the background rate in each of the four detectors , provides the theoretical signal to be compared with the observations .",
    "to obtain our limits we use data from the supernova with data from pioneer venus orbiter gamma burst detector ( pvo gbd)@xcite , luckily in operation in february , 1987 .",
    "the gbd has four energy channels , roughly @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 towards the direction of the supernova , which was propitiously directly overhead at the time , giving the maximum effective area .",
    "we have data for about 1500 sec prior to the supernova lights arrival at venus ( for calculating the background ) , and for 8000 sec after , for time bins of either 12 or 16 sec in duration .",
    "we show the data in figure  [ fig : data ] .",
    "we have verified that there is no clear signal in any of the four channels ; further , the data is consistent with a constant poisson rate in each detector .    to calculate limits on our parameters @xmath0 and @xmath53 ,",
    "we use the folded spectrum @xmath67 and our measurement of the background rate ( observed for a length of time @xmath68 ) in each detector to construct a likelihood function given the observed gamma - ray counts in each detector .",
    "we assume that the folded spectrum @xmath67 gives the mean of a poisson process governing the detected number of counts , and that the rates for each detector are high enough to approximate this by an appropriate normal distribution , for ease of calculation ( in the @xmath66 bin , with the lowest fluence , there are approximately 40 counts per bin ) .",
    "this gives @xmath69 where @xmath70\\ ] ] gives the normal distribution , @xmath71 is the background rate in detector @xmath57 ( observed for a time @xmath68 ) , @xmath72 is the length of time bin @xmath62 , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 are , respectively , the observed and theoretical signal in those time bins , where the latter is calculated with the set of parameters represented by @xmath75 .",
    "finally , the variance is given by @xmath76 , the sum of the theoretical variance of the signal and that due to the background rate ( including a small contribution reflecting the uncertainty in that rate ; this latter effect is somewhat more difficult to include if a poisson distribution is explicitly used but is in any case negligeable ) .",
    "we define a @xmath77 statistic , @xmath78\\ ] ] note that the model is nonlinear , and the variance @xmath79 depends on the model parameters , so we have defined this quantity including the @xmath80 term and that the usual @xmath77 distribution does not apply ; instead we must apply bayes theorem and integrate over the likelihood to determine confidence intervals on our parameters .    because of the two terms contributing to the variance",
    ", the form of @xmath77 depends on which dominates . for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and",
    "the @xmath83 term dominates , so @xmath84 .",
    "when the neutrino signal is small , the background contribution dominates , and @xmath85 .",
    "these regimes are shown in figure  [ fig : chi2 ] , where we plot @xmath77 as a function of @xmath53 for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have used a neutrino temperature of 8  mev , appropriate for mu and tau neutrinos .    immediately ,",
    "we see the character of the limits on the parameters . for @xmath86 , @xmath87 ; in this regime only the data from the first time bin after the supernova contributes .",
    "then @xmath88 for @xmath89 ; now , the full data set provides information .",
    "finally , @xmath90 for @xmath91 ; in this regime the background dominates over the theoretical signal .",
    "note that this latter area of parameter space provides the `` maximum likelihood '' ( or @xmath77 minimum ) ; there is no neutrino signal and we calculate only limits on parameters .",
    "in fact , there is a slight deficit of counts with respect to the background calculated from the time before the supernova ; otherwise we might expect to see a weak maximum likelihood somewhere in the large-@xmath53 regime .    in figure",
    "[ fig : contour ] , we show a single contour of @xmath77 in the @xmath53-@xmath0 plain . from a `` bayesian '' viewpoint , this figure represents the the complete inference from the data ; we obviously would prefer to quote limits on the parameter space .    because @xmath77 is constant for both large and small values of the parameters @xmath53",
    ", we must be careful in normalizing our probabilities . without any other information to guide us",
    ", we might expect the appropriate prior to use would be either @xmath92 or @xmath93 corresponding to constant probability per linear and logarithmic interval , respectively ; however , neither of these choices converge when integrated out to infinity multiplied by a constant likelihood .",
    "these priors , when normalized , assign a vanishing weight to any finite region of parameter space ; usually , @xmath77 goes to infinity like the square of some parameter in a linear gaussian model with independent errors , so the wings are automatically disfavored regardless of the prior .    to get meaningful results in this case",
    "we must make sure that the interesting regime of @xmath94 , @xmath95 is given finite prior weight .",
    "this corresponds to choosing a prior with some cutoff outside of this region , and will result in a limit corresponding to a value of @xmath77 somewhere along the slope between its small and large values . to connect with other analyses , we will adopt the following `` frequentist '' procedure .",
    "we will assume that @xmath77 is distributed in a @xmath77 distribution considering the data as a frequentist random variable .",
    "we have 550 time bins and four detectors , so there are 2200 degrees of freedom . for this distribution , a one - sigma fluctuation corresponds to @xmath96 , a three - sigma ( or 99% ) fluctuation to @xmath97 ; we choose the latter as our limit ; from the shape of the likelihood function it is clear that any comparable @xmath98 will give similar bounds .",
    "we also note that a signal in the small-@xmath53 regime may not be detectable with this algorithm ; the absence of a local minimum in that region , however , implies that this should not be a significant worry .",
    "( we have also used a @xmath77 defined rigorously from the true poisson distribution , which effects the limits on the parameters by somewhat under one order of magnitude throughout . ) the allowed region is shown in figure  [ fig : contour ] .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath99 for neutrinos with a temperature of 8  mev .",
    "( the limits scale roughly as @xmath100 . )",
    "the latter bound corresponds to @xmath101 .",
    "this is less restrictive than the limits of oberauer et al.@xcite , due to the fact that the pvo gbd could only detect gamma rays with energies below @xmath102 , compared to @xmath103 for the smm satellite .",
    "however , we believe this analysis to be more rigorous and the pvo data to be of higher quality .",
    "so far we have considered only photons produced from the simplest radiative decay of a massive neutrino species : @xmath4 , but many other channels are possible . for these reactions , where the rest - frame photon energy is no longer given by the simple @xmath104 , we must allow for a distribution of decay products : @xmath105 gives the fraction of photons produced with rest - frame energy @xmath106 into angle @xmath107 .",
    "then , the final spectrum is given by @xmath108 e^{-\\gamma(1+v{\\bar\\mu})t/\\tau}\\ ] ] where we have still assumed that the decays occur near the supernova , and the integral is taken from @xmath33 to @xmath109 .",
    "( we discuss the case of large masses , @xmath48 in sec .",
    "[ sec : massive ] below . ) for the appropriate choice of @xmath110 , we reproduce the earlier 2-body decay formula , eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) .",
    "in particular , we consider the process , @xmath9 , where typically @xmath111 , @xmath112 . because this is no longer a two - body decay , the spectrum in angle and energy of the daughter photons is considerably more complicated , and there has been no exact calculation performed .",
    "following oberauer et al .",
    "@xcite , we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume isotropy of the photons in the rest frame of the neutrinos ; this is reasonable if the helicity states of the parent neutrinos are produced in equal numbers .",
    "this gives @xmath113 ( which still implicitly depends on @xmath114 through the lorentz transformation to the lab frame ) .",
    "up to factors of order unity , we assume after oberauer et al .   that the energy spectrum is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 refer to the process without a daughter photon : @xmath118 , allowing us to absorb a branching ratio factor into @xmath119 .",
    "now , we can write the gamma - ray flux as @xmath120 if we assume that @xmath121 , the angular average becomes unity .",
    "( a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for @xmath20 then reproduces the expression of eqs .",
    "( 6 - 7 ) of oberauer et al.@xcite ) with the additional assumption that a negligible fraction of the decays occur inside of the progenitor and that detected gamma rays have energies @xmath122 ( , @xmath123 ) , we get the simple formula @xmath124 where @xmath125 again gives the total energy in the decaying neutrino species .",
    "note that this expression is correct for any form of @xmath20 . at early times",
    "the flux is constant , although there will be an exponential decay for @xmath126 . in the two - body case ,",
    "the timescale for gamma - ray detection is set by @xmath127 ; in the case , by @xmath128 .",
    "assuming that most neutrinos will have @xmath129 , the assumptions we have made require that @xmath130 for this formula to hold .",
    "note that this is a restriction on the parameter space of @xmath1 and @xmath17 , since we have approximately 8000 sec of data , and the temperature is of order 8 mev for any neutrino species .    because the flux is proportional to @xmath131 , we will be able to put limits on the combination @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , because the dependence is the same as the large-@xmath53 regime of the 2-body decay case ( cf .",
    "( [ fluxcases ] ) ) , the probability density will be of the same form . when the variance is dominated by the signal , @xmath133 ; when it is dominated by the background , @xmath134 ( the same constant as in the 2-body case ) .",
    "the crossover occurs at @xmath135 .",
    "the value of @xmath77 for this model is shown in figure  [ fig : chi2-brem ] .",
    "using the same quasi - frequentist definition of a 99% confidence level gives limits of @xmath136 because the spectrum peaks at a lower energy , and due to the long time baseline of the pvo data , this limit is comparable to other sn1987a limits for this decay channel@xcite , and we believe more reliable , due to the higher - quality data set .",
    "all of these expressions are considerable more complicated in the case @xmath137 .",
    "we will still assume a zero - chemical - potential fd distribution , this time applying to massive particles : @xmath138 with a `` suppression factor , '' @xmath139 , along with the requirement that @xmath140 .",
    "the factor @xmath139 is just the usual boltzmann suppression ( @xmath141 , for @xmath142 ) ; we use an approximation that is good for @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "( sigl & turner@xcite have calculated the effect of the changing neutrinosphere temperature and radius on this naive expectation ; the effect is small for @xmath145 , at least for @xmath146 . ) for low - mass neutrinos we assumed @xmath147 ; now , we can only integrate over neutrino energies greater than @xmath148 . in this expression , @xmath47",
    "erg remains the total energy for the low - mass case ; the total energy released is @xmath149 ; which for large masses is less than @xmath150  erg since @xmath151    in addition to the mass threshold effects , with massive neutrinos ( @xmath152 ) we must now take into account the loss of any photons produced inside the envelope of the supernova , @xmath153 .",
    "thus , we require that @xmath154 , or @xmath155 note that @xmath156 , so this supersedes the requirement that @xmath157 , but the requirement that @xmath158 remains .",
    "thus , we must integrate over neutrino energies from @xmath159 .",
    "this integral , the equivalent of @xmath160 above , can not be done in closed form , but again it can be approximated by a gaussian ( at least for the isotropic case @xmath161 ) : @xmath162 with @xmath163 the factor of @xmath164 in the exponent approximates the shape of the integral for @xmath165 .",
    "this differs from the massless case by a total suppression factor @xmath166\\ ] ] since @xmath167 , this is always less than @xmath168 $ ] for interesting masses @xmath48 ; unfortunately , the time now appears in the expression for @xmath169 , so the @xmath170 integral is no longer trivial .",
    "first , then , let us consider the suppression factor if we ignore the effect of decays inside the supernova envelope , integrating from @xmath171 .",
    "then the time integral can be done as in the low - mass case , and we can simply write down the time - independent suppression factor @xmath172 ( if we first set @xmath173 when numerically calculating the limits as above ) .",
    "these mass effects enable us to break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath17 , at the price of requiring the more complicated analysis of a three - dimensional parameter space . to simplify matters",
    ", we will base the results for massive neutrinos directly on the limits from the low - mass case .",
    "that is , we will calculate the limits as before , and then apply the suppression factor at the end .",
    "we can do this because the suppression factor comes into the expression for the flux in exactly the same way as the branching ratio @xmath0 , so we translate limits on @xmath0 in the massless case to limits on @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the @xmath33-independent part of the suppression factor .",
    "in addition , we do the calculation for an isotropic decay , and assuming @xmath176 . for two - body decay ,",
    "this results in the limit @xmath177    if we allow the effect of decays inside the progenitor envelope , the calculation is somewhat more complicated , and the integral over each time bin can no longer be done in closed form .",
    "we must now recompute everything at each pair of @xmath1 and @xmath17 .",
    "we show the results of such a calculation for several values of the neutrino mass in figure  [ fig:30mev ] ; the limits are not too different from those with the simpler time - independent suppression .    for the process",
    ", the suppression of a high - mass neutrino flux is simpler to calculate because the required integral is simply @xmath178 , the total energy in the massive neutrino species ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ brem ]",
    "; we have again assumed @xmath122 , so the initial integral over @xmath25 simplifies ) .",
    "again , we integrate from the same @xmath179 ; the suppression is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath180 .",
    "for much of parameter space , this is simply the expected @xmath181 .",
    "again , the time - dependence of @xmath182 does not change the limits significantly .",
    "the allowed parameter space for the process for a mass of 30 mev is @xmath183",
    "thus far , we have assumed that the daughter neutrino in the @xmath184 channel is much less massive than the parent neutrino .",
    "if , however , the mass of the daughter is appreciable , the energy of the photon will be decreased by a factor @xmath185 .",
    "this may improve our limits : it would shift the bulk of the photons down from energies too high to detect into one or more of the energy channels of the pvo detector . for massless daughter neutrinos , of order 1/10 of the photons",
    "can be detected ; therefore we might expect limits as much as an order of magnitude stronger .",
    "in fact , for this case , the lower energy window of the pvo detector , down to @xmath186 mev , compared with the smm window , sensitive only above @xmath187 mev , is actually an advantage .    to make the matter more precise",
    ", we see that in the case of nearly degenerate neutrinos , we make the change @xmath188 ( m^2/\\delta m^2 ) dk\\ ] ] where we now are contrained to have photon energies @xmath189 .",
    "this , in turn , results in changing @xmath190\\approx ( m^2/\\delta m^2 ) h(k / t)$ ] , up to a constant of order one . as expected , the flux is enhanced by a factor of @xmath191 at most energies , so we can make the substitution @xmath192 in our limits .    in particular , we are interested in two regimes of @xmath11 . to account for",
    "the recent evidence of a neutrino mass eigenstate , we set @xmath193@xcite . the most attractive solution to the solar neutrino problem requires @xmath194 , so @xmath195@xcite . to account for the atmospheric @xmath196 deficit , @xmath197 , so @xmath198@xcite .",
    "roughly , we see that our limits will become stronger by factors order @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : degen ] , we show the limits on the neutrino parameters for these two cases .",
    "for long lifetimes ( such that the average decay time of the neutrino is comparable to or longer than the travel time to the detector ) , the above formalism becomes too cumbersome , because we must integrate over a complicated set of possible paths for the neutrino and daughter photon . in this case",
    ", we will make several simplifications . at first",
    ", we will only concern ourselves with the total gamma - ray fluence from the decays , integrated over time .",
    "then , we will integrate over the decay time , @xmath201 : @xmath202\\ ] ] where , as before , @xmath203 gives the fraction of neutrinos with energy @xmath21 decaying into photons with energy @xmath33 .",
    "this expression is to be compared with those presented in @xcite .",
    "the cost of the simplicity of this expression is the inability to determine the exact time of a photon s arrival . for neutrinos and photons travelling on a straight path ( @xmath204 , appropriate for relativistic particles ) , the arrival time after the supernova light - pulse is @xmath205 . for long lifetimes ,",

    "two effects are explicitly missing from this formula : the extra time delay from non - straight paths ( of the same order as the delay already considered ) and the photon energy dependence of the time - delay .",
    "moreover , the time - dependence will not have exactly this shape ; for short times it does not contain the expected slow rise from zero flux , so it is probably safest to use this formula integrated over the entire duration of the experiment , and not rely on the detailed time evolution , leaving us finally with @xmath210 unfortunately , the integration over neutrino energy @xmath21 is considerably more complicated than before , but we can approximate the two exponential decays for various regimes : @xmath211 numerically , these breaks occur at @xmath212 where @xmath213 mev is a typical energy for a @xmath214 mev blackbody . in terms of the lifetime @xmath17 ,",
    "the latter limit occurs at @xmath215for masses @xmath216  mev , this is roughly @xmath217 .",
    "when this is proportional to @xmath218 , the flux is approximately constant ; otherwise , the entire pulse is detected ( and its shape is irrelevent ) .",
    "putting all of this together , and doing the integral over @xmath21 gives @xmath219 where @xmath220 is similar to @xmath221 above , and the four cases correspond to those in eq.([taucases ] ) .",

    "sn1987a not only confirmed astrophysicists standard model of the type ii ( core collapse ) supernovae , but also provided a laboratory for studying the properties of neutrinos .",
    "the fluence of neutrinos at earth was approximately @xmath239 per species .",
    "this large fluence and the space - borne gamma - ray detectors operating on smm and pvo have allowed stringent limits to be placed on the radiative decay of neutrinos .    although there is only 232 seconds of data , in a single time bin ,",
    "the smm detectors were sensitive up to energies of 25 mev , and so would have more likely to detect gamma rays from decaying sn1987a neutrinos with a temperature of 4 - 8 mev . because the limits are determined by the region of parameter where the background becomes comparable to the signal",
    "( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] above ) , the long time base and greater resolution is actually of little use in determining the limits on the parameters . to show this , we have performed our analysis with the smm data as presented in @xcite , using crude estimates of the response matrix and effective area of the detector .",
    "as expected , the results are comparable to , although slightly weaker than , those quoted in that reference . however , in the case where the gamma rays are produced by or the neutrino mass states are nearly degenerate , the pvo limits are comparable or more stringent . finally , the amount of and quality of the pvo data adds additional confidence to the smm - based limits .",
    "portions of this work was performed under nasa grant nag  2 - 765 .",
    "in addition , mst is supported by the doe ( at chicago ) and nasa ( at fermilab ) .",
    "we would like to thank the pvo gbd team , and especially ed fenimore , for access to and expertise in the analysis of the pvo data , and the response matrix for the pvo gbd .",
    "mst thanks f.  vanucci for arousing our interest in the possibility of the neutrinos with nearly degenerate mass eigenstates .",
    "aj would like to especially thank carlo graziani and peter freeman for their patient explanations of the theory and practice of statistics .",
