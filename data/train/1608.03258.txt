    "in statistical physics one basically considers a large set of reversible and conservative ordinary differential equations for the description of particle dynamics .",
    "the temporal evolution for this cumbersome problem , even for a modest number of particles , requires a statistical description which introduces the concept of probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the phase space of the system .",
    "irreversibility , equilibrium , and more important non - equilibrium properties , surge from this probability conception of systems ( with a large number of degrees of freedom ) and its deterministic evolution .",
    "briefly , the methodology reduces ( under some assumptions ) to a kinetic description which displays an irreversible behavior to equilibrium observed in macroscopic systems .",
    "the assumptions for this approach are : i ) macroscopically , a system is described by a finite set of observables ; ii ) the robust instability of the microscopic motions which is at the basis of the sensibility to initial conditions and the ergodic assumption .",
    "iii ) a _ stosszahlansatz _ that introduces explicitly a broken before - after symmetry of the probability distribution evolution .",
    "about 20 years ago , nicolis _",
    "@xcite introduced a systematic coarse - graining approach to the treatment of the macroscopical variables .",
    "as a consequence , this coarse - graining breaks naturally the past - future symmetry in time , leading to an irreversible master equation , for a reduced probability distribution function of the system . in the present paper , we apply this systematic approach to a conservative and explicit reversible cellular automata . in particular , we consider the q2r model , introduced by vichniac in the mid 80s @xcite , which is a cellular automata that runs on a two dimensional grid of finite size , and is reversible in a physical sense , that is , the automata rule is not only invertible , but the backward rule reads exactly the same as the forward one .",
    "moreover , it was shown by pomeau @xcite that the q2r automata possesses a conserved energy - like quantity .    the main reason to apply the coarse - graining approach to a cellular automata instead to a coupled system of ordinary differential equations ,",
    "is because a cellular automata is a discrete model with boolean entities as microscopic variables , thus , the system is numerically reversible and conservative . in consequence , q2r seems to be a good benchmark to test the principles of statistical physics .",
    "but , the phase space is finite , hence the dynamical system only possesses fixed points and periodic orbits , therefore it can not be ergodic , at least in the usual sense of continuos dynamics .",
    "however , for large enough systems , the phase space becomes huge , and the periodic orbits may be , as we show , exponentially long , so in practice , of infinite period .",
    "further , if the initial state is random , the temporal behavior may be quite random and it possesses many aspects of chaotic systems , as sensibility to initial conditions , mixing , etc . for any purpose , the observation of a short periodic orbit is really improbable for large enough systems with random initial conditions . in general , there is a huge number of initial conditions that are `` almost '' ergodic .",
    "numerical studies show that the premises of statistical physics are valid , in particular the observables may be computed using the standard methods of statistical physics .",
    "the study of the dynamics and properties of the q2r model has a long history . soon after the seminal works of vichniac @xcite and pomeau @xcite , herrmann@xcite implemented the q2r algorithm to study the two space dimensional ising model in the frame of the micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "he studied the global magnetization , obtaining an excellent representation for the magnetization as a function of the initial conserved energy , displaying a coherent picture for the phase transition of the ising model .",
    "later , herrmann , carmesin and stauffer @xcite studied numerically the probability to reach an `` infinitely '' long period for some energies .",
    "moreover , if the energy is large enough this probability tends to unity @xcite .",
    "next , takesue @xcite focused on the possible realization of statistical mechanics for reversible cellular automata .",
    "his studies concerned explicitly all class of rule in the one dimensional case , the q2r being only a special case . however , the q2r ( 90r in his terminology ) , is the analogue of an ideal gas of particles with speeds + 1 or -1 , a system that can not reach equilibrium in practice .",
    "but , it is ergodic only in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "more recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of us ( sr ) has studied numerically the irreversible behavior and the existence of a spontaneous transition from a non - coherent state to a coherent state .",
    "the present article is organized as follows , the q2r model , as well as its main features and findings are presented in section [ model ] .",
    "this section is sub - divided as follows : we briefly report the numerical studies of ref .",
    "@xcite in sub - section [ longtime ] ; the phase space properties , in particular some results on the distribution of periods of the dynamics is reported in subsection [ phasespace ] ; and , finally , the scope of the paper is presented in sub section [ scope ] .",
    "section [ mastereqn ] , introduces the notion of a master equation for the statistical description of the dynamics .",
    "finally , in section [ results ] we provide some precise examples , where a coarse graining is realized , in order to get an adequate and tractable master equation .",
    "we provide an exhaustive validation of the technique and we discuss different coarse - graining over the phase space . finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] shows our conclusions .",
    "for simplicity we shall consider a regular two dimensional lattice with @xmath0 nodes , in which each node is only seen by its four closest neighbors ( the von neuman neighborhood ) , finally we use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each node @xmath1 possesses a discrete value @xmath2 that may take a value + 1 or -1 .",
    "the q2r model , introduced by vichniac @xcite , is based upon the following two step rule :    @xmath3 where the function @xmath4 is such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 if @xmath7 . in the sum @xmath8 corresponds to the von neuman neighbor in the site @xmath1 .",
    "the reversibility follows directly from the inverse relation @xmath9 which is the backward rule ( notice that @xmath10 in all cases ) .",
    "this two step rule may be naturally re - written as an one step rule by introducing a second dynamical variable @xcite : @xmath11 the rule ( [ q2r ] ) is complemented with the initial condition @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    as shown by pomeau @xcite , the energy @xmath14   = -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\left <",

    "moreover , the energy is bounded by @xmath16 .    despite the existence of an energy - like quantity ,",
    "it is not possible to speak about a hamiltonian discrete dynamic because , the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the energy ( [ energy ] ) are discrete quantities @xcite .",
    "moreover , supported by the existence of a large number of periodic orbits ( see next ) , it is believed that q2r possesses a large number of other invariants , however , up to date , other conserved quantities are not known yet .",
    "numerical simulations of the q2r model in two space dimensions for large system sizes , _ eg . _ @xmath19 , and random initial conditions , shows that the dynamics displays a fluctuating spatio - temporal pattern showing regions with states + 1 and sectors with states @xmath20 , as well as , zones with chessboard - like pattern @xcite . the full patterns will be characterized by the global magnetization  : @xmath21   =   \\sum_{k }   x^{t}_k , \\label{magnetization}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] naturally , the function @xmath22 is restricted to the interval @xmath23 , and the available values of @xmath22 are ranged in uniform steps of @xmath24 .",
    "a detailed characterization of the evolution , as well as , of the fluctuations of the magnetization has been treated in detail in ref .",
    "briefly , after a transient the average magnetization depends mainly on the initial energy .",
    "if the energy is low , one sees that the average magnetization evolves slowly in time to an `` equilibrium '' state with an almost constant value plus weak fluctuations . for larger energies , the fluctuations enter to play an important role .",
    "one may observe that the system is in an almost stable state , but then suddenly jumps into a metastable state with zero average magnetization , and then jumps into an opposite magnetization state @xcite .",
    "the plot of the temporal average of the global magnetization versus the energy is done in fig .",
    "one sees that the magnetization spontaneously increases below a critical energy per site around @xmath25 , close to the critical energy of the ising model @xmath26 .",

    "each point corresponds to a different initial condition , in this case we sample different energies .",
    "as it can be noticed , there is a finite system dependence on the critical behaviour of the system , indeed the critical behavior disappear for small system sizes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , whereas for large system the magnetization curve reach a critical behavior .",
    "the continuous line represents the well known statistical mechanics calculation for the ising model @xmath29.,width=264 ]      the configurational space of all states is defined through all possible values of the state @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting space is composed by the @xmath31 vertices of a @xmath32-dimensional hypercube .",
    "the smallest possible system corresponds to a @xmath33 lattice . in this case",
    "there are @xmath34 states and the phase space is a hypercube in dimension 8 , however the dynamics is too simple , it does contain cycles of period 4 at most . the phase space of a @xmath35 system is the largest possible one that can be studied exactly case by case . in this case",
    "the system possesses @xmath36 states and it contains a rich variety of cycles ( see table [ example4x4 ] ) .",
    "this case will be studied deeply as a good benchmark for conjectures in larger dimensional systems .    as an example , from this case , it is observed that the total number of cycles , @xmath37 , of period @xmath38 and energy @xmath39 , would be bounded by @xcite @xmath40 from the data one has that for @xmath41 and @xmath35 , @xmath42 , but this value varies as the lattice size increases . here one notices a dramatic difference among the cases @xmath43 greater or smaller than @xmath44 , if @xmath43 is greater than @xmath45 the probability to see a long period is exponentially small , but on the contrary , for @xmath46 this probability reaches the unity .",
    "higher lattice sizes confirm this scenario but modify slightly the value of @xmath47 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "though the q2r model is quite simple its dynamics is usually very rich as it has been documented extensively in literature .",
    "moreover , this conservative and reversible system appears to behave as a typical macroscopic system , as the number of degrees of freedom increases , showing , in particular , a typical irreversible behavior , sensibility of the initial conditions , a kind of mixing , etc .",
    "it is believed that this q2r is a good representation of an ising model in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the phase space of the q2r system of @xmath48 sites possesses @xmath49 states , which is partitioned in different sub - spaces of constant energies , which itself are partitioned in a large amount of smaller subspaces of periodic orbits or fixed points .",
    "notice that , because the system is conservative , there are neither attractive nor repulsive attractors , all attractors are fixed points or cycles .",
    "this feature of the phase space is schematized in fig .",
    "[ cycledraft ] ( a ) , where the constant energy subspace shares in principle many cycles and fixed points . an arbitrary initial condition of energy @xmath39 falls into one of these cycles , and it runs until it comes back to the initial configuration after a time @xmath38 , which could be exponentially long and it displays a complex behavior ( not chaotic stricto - sensu , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "more important the probability that an initial condition possesses such a complex behavior is finite @xcite .",
    "moreover , q2r manifests `` sensitivity to initial conditions '' , that is , if one starts with two distinct , but close , initial conditions , then , they evolve into very different cycles as time evolves @xcite . in some sense ,",
    "an initial state explores vastly the phase space justifying the grounds of statistical physics .    in conclusion ,",
    "the overall picture is  : although for a finite size system the deterministic automata q2r possesses a periodic dynamics so it is not ergodic , there is a huge number of initial conditions that explore vastly the configurational space ( this is particularly remarkably for initial conditions of random structure ) .",
