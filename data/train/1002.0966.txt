    "recently , investigations of topological phases and phase transitions has attracted great attention in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the quantum hall state@xcite is the first example of a topological state of quantum matter , with a fully gap ground state in the bulk , and gapless excitations at the edge .",
    "the chiral edge state is a holographic mirror of bulk topology@xcite . in the recently discovered time reversal invariant topological insulators@xcite ,",
    "helical edge states are confined at the edge by the bulk energy gap , and states with opposite spins counter - propagate . in the case of the quantum spin hall state",
    "realized in hgte quantum wells , the topologically trivial and non - trivial states are separated by a topological quantum phase transition , tunable by the thickness of the quantum well .",
    "quantum spin chain is another example where topological quantum phase transition is found .",
    "the low energy dynamics of 1d large - spin heisenberg antiferromagnet can be described as o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model@xcite .",
    "half - integer - spin chains are generally gapless , while integer spin chains are gapped ; they are described by the o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model with and without the topological term .",
    "this distinction bears strong similarity to the topological insulators , which is distinct from the conventional insulators by the presence of a topological term@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a spin-2 chain model with two topologically distinct , transactionally invariant ground states .",
    "one model has edge state @xmath2 , while the other model has edge spin @xmath4 .",
    "the berry s phase associated with the edge spins differ by @xmath6 .",
    "the square of the time reversal operator @xmath7 gives @xmath8 for the first case , whereas it gives @xmath9 in the second case .",
    "due to this topological difference , the two ground states must be separated by one or several topological quantum phase transitions where the spin gap closes .",
    "this paper is constructed as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will review two exact solvable quantum spin model in one dimension .",
    "some materials can be systematically found in a brilliant work by tu et.al@xcite .",
    "afterwards , our new model hamiltonian is presented according to the topological argument .",
    "corresponding numerical results are shown in the third section , where phase diagram is discussed as well .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the end .",
    "our starting point is an integer spin model introduced by affleck , kennedy , lieb , and tasaki , namely the aklt model@xcite .",
    "it is proved that the aklt model has a unique infinite volume ground state , with an exponential decay spin - spin correlation@xcite . in agreement with the haldane conjecture@xcite , the excitation gap of aklt model is nonzero",
    ". the ground state of aklt model can be written down exactly in terms of schwinger bosons : @xmath10where",
    "@xmath11 stands for site spin , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are creation operators of schwinger bosons at the @xmath14th site .",
    "this ground state can be rephrased in a pictorial form .",
    "the spin-2 aklt ground state can be schematically shown in fig[fig : spin2aklt ] , where the circles stand for sites on the chain .",
    "each spin-2 can be decomposed into totally symmetric combinations of four spin-1/2 states , and each state is represented by a solid dot in the figure .",
    "two pairs of neighboring dots form singlet states , shown in red bonds .",
    "these bonds are usually called _",
    "valence bonds _ , and in this sense , aklt ground state is usually referred as _ valence bond state_. it is proved rigorously that this ground state is unique under this periodic boundary condition . due to the symmetric intra - site coupling and anti - symmetric inter - site coupling ,",
    "the parent hamiltonian of this ground state is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the projection operators onto the spin-3 and spin-4 subspaces respectively .",
    "the positive coefficients ensure the state in eq.([eq : aklt_ground_state ] ) to be the corresponding groundstate .    in 1998 ,",
    "scalapino , zhang , and hanke ( szh ) introduced a so(5 ) symmetric spin model@xcite with an exact valence bond ground state .",
    "the original motivation for the model is to illustrate the so(5 ) theory of high tc superconductivity , which unifies the antiferromagnetic ( af ) and the d - wave superconducting ( sc ) phases@xcite .",
    "however , it was soon found later that the so(5 ) symmetry can also be interpreted as an enhanced spin rotational symmetry@xcite .",
    "the szh model contains five quantum states at each site , forming the vector representation of the so(5 ) group .",
    "however , these five states can also be interpreted as the quantum states of the spin @xmath0 of the so(3 ) spin chain .",
    "szh presented an exact ground state wave function expressed as a matrix product state of the dirac @xmath18 matrices , and showed that the edge states of the szh model are 4 fold degenerate at each edge .",
    "interpreted as an @xmath0 chain language , the edge spin contains @xmath4 spin quantum numbers . following this work , more valence bond states with",
    "higher symmetry groups have been constructed@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the szh model is the following .",
    "the tensor product of two so(5 ) spinor can be decomposed into so(5 ) singlet , antisymmetric tensor , and symmetric traceless tensor , namely , @xmath19 in analogy with the spin-1 aklt model , the largest subspace is projected out , leading to the desired szh model : @xmath20 due to the clifford algebra of the five @xmath18-matrics : @xmath21 , no symmetric traceless components are involved in the product of two @xmath18-matrices . as a consequence , @xmath22 is the ground state of the above szh model , where @xmath23 is a vector label of the so(5 ) group , which can also be interpreted as the @xmath24 quantum numbers of @xmath0 spin chain .    due to the relationships between the so(5 ) and",
    "the so(3 ) groups , there exists a natural deformation of the szh model to an su(2 ) spin-2 szh model . the required map from so(5 )",
    "group onto su(2 ) group with spin-2 is given by : @xmath25 and therefore the szh hamiltonian deforms to ; @xmath26 the ground state is unchanged up to an so(5 ) rotation .    to see if the szh state is gapped or not , we can evaluate the ground state spin correlation function .",
    "the correlation of matrix product state can be easily derived by the transfer matrix technique , given by , @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28@xcite .",
    "define @xmath29 , then @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "as it s an isotropic magnet , the correlation functions are the same in any directions .",
    "after some detail calculation , we derive @xmath32 for integer @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the correlation length @xmath34 of the szh model equals to @xmath35 .",
    "this finite correlation length indicates that the low - lying excitation in the szh model is gapped , consistent with the haldane conjecture .",
    "it is interesting to note that the correlation function of the szh model is negative - definite , with a correlation length @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the lattice constant is almost twice of the correlation length , and the spins at neighboring sites correlate extremely weakly . on the other hand , according to arovas _ et.al_ s work@xcite , the correlation length for spin-2 aklt is @xmath37 which is roughly the lattice constant .",
    "therefore , although aklt model is also a strongly disordered antiferromagnet , the neighboring spins are closely correlated , leading to the conventional staggering correlation function , say , @xmath38 .",
    "now we have two sets of models of 1-dimensional spin-2 chain with exactly known hamiltonians and ground state wavefunctions .",
    "the differences between the aklt and szh model are not only the analytic forms as they appear , but also the topological distinctions . the same as topological insulator , the bulk topology is relevant to the edge state of an open chain . for the spin-2 aklt model , two solid dots at each edge remain free .",
    "symmetrical combination of these two spin-1/2 dots results an edge spin with @xmath2 .",
    "this boson - like edge state is consistent with large - n theory of su(n ) quantum antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "however , the szh model serves a complement of the large - n analysis . for an open chain",
    ", the szh ground state is given by @xmath39 it explicitly shows that at each edge , there are four degrees of freedom since the matrix product state is four dimensional . therefore , the edge state of szh model is spin-3/2 , _ ie .",
    "_ , fermion - like .",
    "that is completely different from the aklt model .",
    "as the edge state is protected by topology , and is robust under perturbation , the aklt and szh models belong to different topological classes .",
    "it can be easily understood from the berry phase s language .",
    "berry phase @xmath40 is the additional phase when the spin winds around , which relates to the expectation value of @xmath41 by @xmath42 , where @xmath7 is the time reversal operator .",
    "it s well - known that @xmath9 for half integer spins such as @xmath4 , while @xmath8 for integer spins such as @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "the berry phases of the two models under investigation differ by an angle of @xmath6 .",
    "it is this difference that makes topological distinction of aklt and szh models . from another points of view",
    ", the edge spin determines the ground state degeneracy ( gsd)@xcite , and naturally serves as a topology index in analogy to fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "these two models thus have different topology index due to different edge spins .",
    "given the topological distinction of the two ground states , we construct a model hamiltonian interpolating between the aklt and szh models : @xmath43 without loss of generality , we set @xmath44 , @xmath45 in the following . as the edge state is robust",
    "unless the gap closes , there must exist one or several topological quantum phase transitions ( tqpt ) where the gap closes and reopens in the evolution of @xmath1 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "this tqpt can be addressed by studying the behavior of energy spectrum and correlation function at each @xmath1 .",
    "( a ) and the absolute value of its corresponding second derivative @xmath48 ( b ) , as a function of @xmath1 , got by dmrg with 600 states and @xmath49 at different system sizes .",

    "the _ density matrix renormalization group _ ( dmrg ) method is employed@xcite in our study . for this purpose",

    "we make use of the open boundary condition ( obc ) and the total number of sites is @xmath56 . to check the finite - size effect of the system",
    ", we have studied the ground state energy per site @xmath57 and the absolute value of the corresponding second derivative @xmath48 with respect to @xmath1 , with system size @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as shown in fig.[fig : energy_gradient ] .",
    "such the ground state energy @xmath57 starts to converge , and the sharp peak of @xmath60 appears at @xmath61 .",
    "besides the ground state energy , we have also calculated the correlation functions , and find that the finite - size effect can be neglected at @xmath62 . therefore ,",
    "in the following calculation , @xmath56 is adopted , for which the finite - size effect can be completely neglected .",
    "consistent with the discussion above , the existence of tqpt is clearly supported by the numerical calculation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_gradient ] .",
    "the second derivative of the ground energy has a sharp peak around @xmath63 , which indicates the second order quantum phase transition addressed above .",
    "this is further confirmed by the real - space spin - spin correlation function , as shown in fig.[fig : scor_n600 ] . at @xmath3 and @xmath47 ,",
    "the correlation function is exactly the same with the analytical result .",
    "when @xmath64 , the correlation behaves similarly with the aklt model , showing an oscillating behavior with respect the lattice separation .",
    "however , when @xmath65 , the correlation behaves similarly with the szh model , showing an negative - definite behavior . at the critical point , the correlation function undergoes an qualitative change from aklt to szh .    to get the ground state phase diagram",
    ", we also calculate the peak position @xmath66 of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath67 , as shown in fig.[fig : de_dimer ] . above the red line",
    ", the system is topologically connected to szh model , and therefore belongs to the same topological class as szh phase .",
    "one feature of this phase is translational symmetric and has spin-@xmath68 excitations on the edge .",
    "similarly , the regions where @xmath1 is small belong to the same topological class as aklt phase .",
    "translational symmetry is also respected , but with spin-@xmath47 excitations on the edge .     and @xmath67 .",
    "( * a*)the existence of dimerization is established by choosing different system sizes @xmath69 .",
    "( * b*)dimer order parameters for different @xmath67 .",
    "this parameter disappears for the critical @xmath70.,width=345,height=288 ]    .",
    "the location of second order phase transition for different @xmath67 is indicated by the red line .",
    "the yellow region above red line belongs to szh topological class , while the light blue region belongs to aklt class .",
    "possible dimerization is shown in the green region sandwiched between these two phases .",
    "[ fig : de_dimer],width=345,height=230 ]    however , one thing we should keep in mind that even the model hamiltonian is translational invariant , spontaneous symmetry breaking is also possible .",
    "one well known example is the biliear - biquadratic model for spin-1 chain , whose hamiltonian is also written in terms of local projections , and translational invariant .",
    "however , the emergence of the dimerized phase is addressed in previous works@xcite@xcite@xcite . in order to quantitatively describe this issue , the following dimer order parameter @xmath71 as a function of @xmath1",
    "is introduced , where @xmath14 labels the center site in the spin chain so that one can minimize the possible finite - size effect induced by open boundary condition . in the calculation ,",
    "the total site number @xmath69 is set to be an even number to avoid potential ambiguity in the definition , in which case @xmath14 is simply @xmath72 .",
    "the indications of dimerization is plotted in fig.[dimer ] .",
    "it is shown explicitly that dimerization appears with proper choices of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath67 .",
    "one can rule out possible finite size effect as the dimer order parameter does nt scale with the system size @xmath69 , shown in fig.[dimer](a ) .",
    "when @xmath67 decreases , the maximum amplitude of dimer order parameter decreases as well , and the dimerization expands less and less regions of @xmath1 monotonously . at the critical point @xmath70 , dimer order parameter vanishes for any @xmath1 , and the corresponding dimerization phase shrinks as well .",
    "the system undergoes a quantum phase transition without spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry . during this phase transition , the energy and spin - spin correlation function",
    "have the same form as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : energy_gradient ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : scor_n600 ] ) .",
    "however it s worth mentioning that for neel state of spin-2 chain , the corresponding dimer order parameter would be 8 .",
    "therefore our dimer order parameter is pretty small compared to strict antiferromagnets , and the dimerization phase can not be confirmed definitely .",
    "one possibility is the gap between excitation state and ground state for the present model is too small to be distinguished numerically . as a result",
    ", certain dimerized excitation state enters into our results and lead to such finite but tiny dimer order parameter .",
    "a promising solution is to apply the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) here , so that one can rule out the possibility of dimerization acquired from open boundary condition .",
    "therefore , we have also done some calculation by dmrg for system with pbc . for the system size @xmath73 sites",
    ", we keep up to @xmath74 states with truncation error smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "finally , we find that both obc and pbc systems give us consistent results",
    ".    observed the possible presence of dimerization , one can readily work out the phase diagram , see fig.[fig : de_dimer ] .",
    "the red curve stands for critical points of @xmath48 , while the two dashed dark curves are upper / lower bounds of dimerized phase of each @xmath67 value .",
    "it shows the onset value for second order derivative coincides with the upper bound of dimerized phase , so that they describe the same phase transition between dimerized phase and szh phase . while on the aklt side",
    ", the phase transition would be of higher order that is invisible in fig.[fig : energy_gradient ] . despite the possible presence of dimerized phase , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition without spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry at @xmath66 when @xmath70 .",
    "as the symmetry is unchanged in this case , this phase transition is originated from the topology only .    in conclusion ,",
    "the topological distinction of the aklt model and szh model for the @xmath0 spin chain is presented in this work .",
    "a model hamiltonian as an interpolation between these two models is introduced .",
    "the quantum phase transition of the model is protected by topology , and established by dmrg calculation .",
    "the results indicate the presence of a dimered phase between two topological phases of aklt and szh .",
    "this dimered phase shrinks at critical value of @xmath76 .",
    "one would like to realize this topological phase transition in real materials . on the aklt side",
    ", we have a well defined example already .",
    "@xmath2 edge spin is observed in @xmath0 chain of cscr@xmath77mg@xmath78cl@xmath79@xcite .",
    "however , examples on szh side are still missing .",
    "probably one can employ cold atom techniques to realize tqpt proposed in this paper .",
