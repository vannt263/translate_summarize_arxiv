    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are faint galaxies , whose luminosity @xmath3 is @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "they are characterized by their low surface brightnesses ( gallagher & wyse 1994 for a review ) .",
    "the studies of such low - luminosity objects are important for several reasons .",
    "for example , since lower - mass galaxies are considered to have formed earlier in a hierarchical structure formation scenario based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ( e.g. , blumenthal et al . 1984 ) , dsphs are also expected to be a key to understand the physical properties of building blocks . recently , the observational data for the local group dsphs have become available with relatively high quality and their observed velocity dispersions imply that dsphs generally have high ratios of virial mass to luminosity .",
    "although a physical interpretation of this observational result has long been a matter of debate because tidal heating by the galaxy could raise the velocity dispersions ( bellazzini , fusi pecci & ferraro 1996 ; kroupa 1997 ; klessen & kroupa 1998 ) , now we have increasing evidence that dsphs have a large amount of dm ( aaronson 1983 ; mateo et al .",
    "1993 ; hirashita , kamaya & takeuchi 1999 ) as predicted based on the cdm model .    based on the observational data , hirashita , takeuchi , & tamura ( 1998 , hereafter htt98 ) have discovered an interesting relation between the virial mass , @xmath0 , and the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath6 : there exists a prominent discontinuity at @xmath7 . based on the assumption that a dsph is embedded in a dm - dominated potential well , htt98 have given a physical interpretation to this queer relation and suggested a scenario for star formation in a dsph by considering an initial starburst and a subsequent feedback of energy from sne to the ism .",
    "although their scenario succeeded in explaining the above relation , other kinds of properties of dsphs must be compared with it to confirm the interpretation . in particular , their metallicities",
    "should be involved in , since they reflect the star formation history ( e.g. , tinsley 1980 ) . actually , the chemical enrichment history of dsphs remains to be tested along with the scenario in htt98 .",
    "moreover , since the metallicities of the dsphs are very low ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ; mateo 1998 ) , they provide us valuable opportunities to study the star formation that occurred in a low - metallicity gas cloud and to reveal the formation of first luminous objects in the early universe . in this _ letter _ , therefore , we focus on the observed virial mass  metallicity ( @xmath0[fe / h ] ) relation , and examine whether it can be consistently understood in the same theoretical framework that succeeded in explaining the mass  luminosity ( @xmath9@xmath0 ) relation . the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation among dsphs as well as dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) near the galaxy and m31 has been investigated ( caldwell et al .",
    "1992 , 1998 ; caldwell 1999 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "however , if a dsph has a large amount of dm and formed stars in the dm - dominated potential , virial mass should be more fundamental than stellar mass in determining the dynamical timescale .",
    "the rest of this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the observed mass  metallicity relation for the dsphs after showing the sample and data . in   3 , the classical understanding of the relation is presented and the limitations on applying it to the dsphs are pointed out . in   [ sec : discuss ] , we will propose a new scenario for chemical enrichment of the dsphs and discuss whether the mass  metallicity and the mass  luminosity relations are understood consistently .",
    "for the two physical parameters , the virial mass ( @xmath0 ) and the metallicity ( here [ fe / h ] is adopted ) , of the local group dsphs , we use the values and errors compiled by mateo ( 1998 ) .",
    "we adopt the data of ursa minor , draco , carina , sextans , sculptor , fornax , leo i , leo ii , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , ngc 205 ( i.e. , the same sample as that in htt98 ) .",
    "the values are renewed according to mateo ( 1998 ) , but this renewal does not affect the following discussions .",
    "the whole sample is divided into two groups at @xmath10 : the low - mass group includes ursa minor , draco , carina , sextans , sculptor , leo i , and leo ii ; the others belong to the high - mass group .",
    "this classification is based on the mass  luminosity relation and is the same as that adopted by htt98 .",
    "we show the observational mass  metallicity relation of the dsphs in the present sample in figure  [ fig : mass_metal ] , where a shaded region is occupied by the low - mass dsphs . as the error bars of [ fe / h ] in the figure",
    ", we adopt the intrinsic dispersions of [ fe / h ] among stellar populations of each dsph , which are larger than the mean error of [ fe / h ] ( mateo 1998 ) . for virial masses",
    ", errors are calculated by considering those of the central stellar velocity dispersion of a dsph and the distance to it from the galaxy .",
    "since these two errors are on average @xmath11% and @xmath12% , respectively ( mateo 1998 ) , the resulting error of a virial mass is evaluated to be a factor of 1.6 , which is adopted in figure  [ fig : mass_metal ] .",
    "the vertical line ( @xmath13 ) indicates the boundary of the two groups . to include fornax in the high - mass group according to htt98 , the separating mass is smaller by a factor of 2 than that in htt98 . in the following ,",
    "this separating virial mass ( @xmath14 ) is shown as @xmath15 by adopting its order of magnitude .",
    "we believe this description to be reasonable because it has an error as mentioned above .",
    "the relation between the initial gas mass @xmath16 and [ fe / h ] calculated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ya87 ) is well represented by a single linear law .",
    "the solid line in figure 1 is obtained by the least square fitting to the data of table  1 in ya87 , expressed as @xmath17 } = 0.745 \\log ( m_{\\rm g}/m_\\odot ) - 7.55\\ , , \\label{eq : ya_fitting}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the initial mass of the system and the luminosity - weighted [ fe / h ] is adopted . in figure 1 , we adopt @xmath16 as the virial mass for the convenience in presentation . since ya87 did not include the dark matter in their model , we may not be able to compare this relation directly with our @xmath0[fe / h ] relation .",
    "however , it can be used as a reference for understanding the relation .",
    "arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) constructed a chemical and photometric evolution model for elliptical galaxies ( see also kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "their scenario tells us that a more massive elliptical galaxy can retain the ism longer than a less massive one , and will be chemically enriched further .",
    "consequently their model predicts the mass  metallicity sequence among elliptical galaxies , and it successfully explains a number of the observational properties of nearby elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , davies et al .  1987 ; bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ) and provides a reasonable picture of their evolutions ( e.g. , stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ; kodama et al .",
    "ya87 suggested that the galactic wind model can be extended to the mass range ( @xmath18 ) of des and dsphs .",
    "the fitting to the prediction by ya87 ( eq .  [ [ eq : ya_fitting ] ] ) is shown in figure  [ fig : mass_metal ] ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "it is shown that ya87 roughly reproduced the overall trend in the observed mass  metallicity relation .",
    "however , the above consideration overlooks a crucial piece in the physical processes of the galaxy formation , which is the fact that the binding energy of a dsph with @xmath19 is roughly equal to or smaller than the energy released by several sne ( saito 1979a ) .",
    "this indicates that once a dsph begins to form stars actively , it can no longer sustain gas and thus it has no time to proceed with chemical enrichment efficiently .",
    "therefore , a strongly regulated phase of star formation with an extremely low rate is necessary to enrich a low - mass dsph .",
    "nishi & tashiro ( 2000 ) have recently shown that a star formation activity in a cloud whose metallicity is less than 1/100 times the solar value can be strongly regulated due to the lack of coolant .",
    "since the observed metallicities of the low - mass dsphs are comparable to 1/100 times the solar value , such a regulation process is likely to have occurred in their formation epochs .",
    "as considered above , a special care should be taken to understand the mass  metallicity relation , especially for the dsphs with @xmath21 . here ,",
    "we present another piece of evidence that motivates us to consider that a dsph in the low - mass range must be separated from a more massive one .",
    "htt98 have shown that there is a clear difference in the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath0 for the two groups ( the low - mass group with @xmath1 and the high - mass group with @xmath2 ) of the local group dsphs .",
    "the @xmath9s of the low - mass dsphs are spread over a significantly wide range .",
    "htt98 interpreted this to be a variation of the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) .",
    "here the sfe indicates the total mass of formed stars divided by the initial gas mass .",
    "a brief summary of htt98 will be given in the following .",
    "first , the discontinuity in the @xmath9@xmath0 relation at @xmath22 appears at the threshold where the ism in the dsphs is blown away efficiently by successive supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the virial mass threshold of @xmath23 is derived from the blow - away condition calculated by mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) .",
    "a proto - dwarf galaxy in the high - mass group would consume gas relatively completely in making stars because its large binding potential sustains gas .",
    "its stellar mass is resultantly proportional to initial gas mass and leads to an almost constant @xmath9 .",
    "note that the ratio of initial gas mass and dark mass in a proto - galaxy is assumed to be constant over entire mass range of dsphs . for a galaxy in the low - mass group ,",
    "the ism is predicted to be blown away efficiently by the sn explosions after the initial burst of star formation .",
    "it is essential to emphasize here that this scenario is built up on the basis of the fact that the binding energy of a proto - dwarf galaxy is equal to the energy released by ten or less sne .",
    "therefore , if one ob association forms in a proto - dwarf galaxy , the galaxy can continue star formation until the heating by sne affects the whole galaxy and cause a blowout of the ism on a short timescale of @xmath24 yr .",
    "this implies that the resultant physical parameters of a proto - dwarf galaxy ( mass , metallicity , etc ) after a blow - away are determined by the specific conditions of star formation such as the spatial distribution of gas , or temperatures of the first ob stars . as a result",
    ", we expect some kinds of stochastic behavior to appear in a resulting stellar mass and metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "such stochasticity can actually be found in the @xmath9@xmath0 relation of the low - mass dsphs . according to figure  1 in htt98 , the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath6 ) ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath25 with an order - of - magnitude scatter .",
    ", @xcite showed that it is 4.6 .",
    "we use the latter value here . ] as explained in   [ subsec : origin ] ,",
    "this is suggested to be caused by a scatter of sfe with a similar order of magnitude .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the high - mass dsphs are also located on the extension from the sequence of des in the mass  luminosity relation as well as the mass  metallicity relation .",
    "actually , mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) suggested that the ism in a high - mass dsph is not easily blown away by an initial burst , which implies that the classical picture holds for the high - mass dsphs .",
    "in contrast , it is suggested to be difficult for the low - mass dsphs to maintain star formation against the stellar feedback to proceed with chemical enrichment to the observed level because of their too small binding energy .",
    "therefore , in the following , we focus on the dsphs in the low - mass group as a target to reconsider how their chemical enrichment has proceeded .",
    "if a formation of a dsph started from a proto - galactic gas cloud , the subsequent star formation after a massive star forms is suggested to be self - regulated as long as the metallicity is @xmath26 times the solar value ( nishi & tashiro 2000 ) .",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "since the metal - line cooling is extremely inefficient in such a low - metallicity environment , the coolant is @xmath27 .",
    "however , the uv radiation from a central massive star dissociates the h@xmath28 molecules , causing a strong regulation of star formation .",
    "this process avoids forming stars efficiently in a dsph belonging to the low - mass group and enables a dsph to continue star formation without blowing away the ism and allow chemical enrichment to proceed . since several sne release energy comparable to the binding energy of the ism",
    ", a star formation rate of a dsph in this phase should be considerably low and thus chemical enrichment would also proceed gradually . if the metallicity finally reaches to @xmath29 } \\sim -2 $ ] , with which the metal cooling becomes effective , a starburst may occur and a following galactic wind would blow away the ism .",
    "nishi & tashiro ( 2000 ) discussed how many sne are required for a primordial gas cloud with @xmath30 to have @xmath29 } \\sim -2 $ ] .",
    "if their discussion is extended to the mass range for the dsphs in the low - mass group , it is found that about 500 sne are necessary , and thus a timescale of @xmath31  gyr is required .",
    "here we assumed that sn explosions caused by a massive star whose lifetime is @xmath32 yr subsequently occurs one - by - one in a proto - galactic gas cloud with the gas mass of @xmath33 .",
    "the mass of stars formed in the regulation phase can be estimated as follows .",
    "adopting the salpeter s initial mass function ( imf ) with the lower and upper cutoffs @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , it is shown that the averaged mass of sn progenitors ( stars whose mass is larger than @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 .",
    "the total mass of the high - mass stars ( i.e. , sn progenitors ) is @xmath38 . applying the same imf ,",
    "the total stellar mass is calculated to be @xmath39 .",
    "this is clearly much smaller than the present stellar mass of dsphs .",
    "thus , the majority of stars in the dsphs must be formed in the starburst after the regulation becomes ineffective .",
    "consequently , if further significant chemical enrichment does not occur because of an instantaneous blow - out after the burst , a dsph with @xmath40 would have an [ fe / h ] @xmath41 at the present epoch , which is consistent with the observed metallicity as shown in figure  1 .      in the previous subsection ,",
    "the origin of the observed metallicity levels of the dsphs in the low - mass group was explored . as shown in figure 1",
    ", it should also be emphasized that the mass  metallicity relation among the low - mass dsphs is characterized by a significant scatter of metallicity .",
    "we are now in a position to consider the origin of this metallicity variation . according to pagel ( 1997 , p.  219 )",
    ", the metallicity ( @xmath42 ) of a galaxy as a closed system is expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the yield of the chemical enrichment effective in the lifetime of the galaxy , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the masses of the stars and the gas , respectively .",
    "the metallicity is evaluated at the galactic wind era , @xmath47 , since the chemical enrichment of the interstellar gas can proceed only up to @xmath47 . since dsphs lost a significant fraction of their gas at @xmath47",
    "( saito 1979b ) , @xmath48 is adopted",
    ". then we obtain @xmath49 where we have defined the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) as @xmath50 at @xmath47 , that is , the stellar mass normalized by the gas mass at @xmath47 .    as stated in   3.2 ,",
    "if the initial gas mass is proportional to the virial mass , @xmath9 of a dsph in the low - mass group is approximately proportional to 1/sfe .",
    "following this context , the sfes of the dsphs in the low - mass group are expected to spread over an order of magnitude because their @xmath9s are distributed over a wide range with the similar magnitude .",
    "since we see from equation ( [ eq : sfe ] ) that the metallicity varies with sfe and , indeed , the [ fe / h ] for the low - mass dsphs has about 1 order of magnitude scatter , it is suggested that the scatter of [ fe / h ] in the low - mass dsphs is consistent with the variation of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we discuss the physical origin of the scatter of sfe among the low - mass dsphs . as mentioned in ",
    "[ subsec : htt98 ] , this is likely to originate from that of initial condition in the formation of low - mass dsphs .",
    "mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) suggested that a blow - away condition depends on the ellipticity of initial gas density distribution .",
    "this indicates that a star formation in a proto - dwarf galaxy also depends on the initial ellipticity , which is presumably determined at random ( e.g.bardeen et al .",
    "one of the other possibilities for the scatter of sfe is a variation in temperatures of ob stars formed in a starburst .",
    "since their ionizing photons dissociate a surrounding h  i region and suppress star formation , an sfe in a forming dsph is considered to be affected by their temperatures . for a low - mass dsph",
    ", this effect can be severe because only a small number of ob stars form at one time and thus temperatures that he stars have are considered to be determined stochastically . in order to evaluate quantitatively to what extent the observed scatter is reproduced by a reasonable range of variations of initial conditions , further theoretical studies with stochastic processes are needed .",
    "it might be found from such studies that some external factors like environmental effects are required .",
    "it may be noticed that in some dsphs ( e.g. , draco , andromeda ii ) , large internal dispersions of metallicity among the stars are observed . if we consider the inhomogeneity of the distribution of gas density in a proto - galactic cloud , chemical enrichment in the galaxy can also proceed inhomogeneously because the outflow efficiency of gas differs from place to place . as a result",
    ", internal dispersions of metallicity can be produced .",
    "such an inhomogeneity could affect a measurement of an average [ fe / h ] in a dsph because [ fe / h ] of each dsph has been determined mainly by examining only a small number of giant stars especially for the local group dsphs .",
    "it may be hence implied that an intrinsic dispersion of metallicity among the dsphs is difficult to find based on the observed scatter of [ fe / h ] .",

    "we are grateful to r. nishi and m. tashiro for discussions and k. ohta , s. mineshige , and h. shibai for continuous encouragement .",
