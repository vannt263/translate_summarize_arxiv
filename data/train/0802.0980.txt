    "qcd is widely considered to be a good candidate for a theory of the strong interactions .",
    "asymptotic freedom allows us to perform a perturbative treatment of strong interactions at short distances .",
    "long distance behaviour , however , is not fully understood : it is commonly believed that , due to the nontrivial structure of the physical vacuum , the perturbation expansion does not completely define the theory and that one has to add non - perturbative effects as well . in order to make a comparison with experiments possible even in the resonance energy range , shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite have proposed to use the operator product expansion ( ope ) and to introduce the vacuum expectation values of operators occurring in the ope , the so called _ condensates _ , as phenomenological parameters .",
    "it is worth to study these parameters in order to see whether one can indeed obtain a consistent description of the low energy hadronic physics and get more insight into the properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "it is , in particular , important to determine the range of values of the condensates allowed by presently available experimental data .",
    "condensates are needed in the description of two - point functions of hadronic currents : together with the results of perturbative qcd they allow us to obtain approximate theoretical predictions for the hadronic current correlators in the space - like region . on the other hand ,",
    "in the time - like region , the discontinuity of these amplitudes is directly related to measurable quantities .",
    "analyticity strongly correlates the energy dependence of the amplitudes in these two regions ; however , due to errors affecting both the theoretical predictions as well as the experimental data , the relation of the two - point functions in the time - like and space - like regions must be carefully analysed before it can be used in applications .",
    "there are several methods , generically called _ qcd sum rules _",
    "@xcite , that have been used in the past for obtaining values of the qcd condensates .",
    "they all rely implicitly on the assumption that an analytic extrapolation from the time - like to the space - like region is possible without introducing additional uncertainties .",
    "therefore they can include _ theoretical errors _ in the space - like region only at a qualitative level , and/or need ( explicit and implicit ) assumptions on the derivatives of the amplitudes .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the errors including both experimental and theoretical ones ( truncation of the perturbative and operator product expansions ) is therefore very difficult in these approaches .",
    "the application of fully controlled analytic extrapolation techniques should remedy these effects .",
    "there are a few methods of this sort , in which the error channels in the space - like region are defined through @xmath6-norms @xcite or @xmath7-norms @xcite .",
    "the functional method that we have developed and used in a previous publication for an analysis of the correlator of the @xmath1 current @xcite , allows us to extract within rather general assumptions the condensates from a comparison of the time - like experimental data with the asymptotic space - like results from theory .",
    "we will see that the price to be paid for the generality of assumptions is relatively large errors in the values of the extracted parameters . in this respect ,",
    "our method is not superior to other approaches ; however , we hope that our results provide additional confidence in the numerical results obtained with the help of methods based on qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the first section the theoretical aspects of hadronic @xmath8-decays are considered while in section 3 we describe the experimental data at hand .",
    "the actual method used to extract the condensates is presented in section 4 .",
    "basically the method is the one reported in @xcite but here a generalisation to all channels is performed .",
    "the results are summarised in section 5 .",
    "we quote results in all the four channels where data are available .",
    "results for the @xmath1 channel were already published in @xcite ; for completeness , we repeat those previous results in the present paper and extend our analysis by a new 3-parameter fit .",
    "new results were obtained in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels from 1- , 2- and 3-parameter fits .",
    "we shall also discuss important consistency checks of our method in section 6 .",
    "the comparison of our findings with others present in the literature is performed in section 7 .",
    "the @xmath8 lepton is heavy enough ( @xmath9 gev ) to decay not only into other leptons , but into final states involving hadrons as well .",
    "these decays offer an ideal laboratory for the study of strong interactions , including the transition from the perturbative to the non - perturbative regime of qcd in the simplest possible reaction .",
    "this might explain the tremendous efforts ongoing in both theoretical and experimental studies of @xmath8 physics .",
    "we consider the correlator of hadronic vector and axial - vector charged currents , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 the conservation of the vector current implies @xmath13 .",
    "the connection to experimental observables is most easily expressed with the help of the spectral functions which are related to the absorptive part of the correlators . using the normalisation as defined in most of the previous publications , the functions @xmath14",
    "can be extracted from the decay spectrum of hadronic @xmath15-decays .",
    "the hadronic polarisation tensor can be rewritten using the ope : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the short hand notation for the qcd non - perturbative condensate @xmath18 of dimension @xmath19 and its associated perturbative wilson coefficient @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the squared momentum transfer .",
    "the contribution to ( [ opeexp ] ) of lowest dimension , @xmath22 , is entirely given by perturbation theory .",
    "for that reason it is useful to separate the two contributions in ( [ opeexp ] ) : @xmath23    as will become clear when we describe our method ( section [ sec : method ] ) it is enough to consider the first derivative of the perturbative part , i.e. , the adler function @xmath24 which is known in the massless - quark limit up to terms of order @xmath25 .",
    "after re - summing the leading logarithms it reads , for space - like momenta ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 the coefficients @xmath28 are the same for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels . for 3 flavours , in @xmath29 regularisation , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 @xcite and for @xmath33",
    "there are two estimates @xmath34 @xcite and @xmath35 @xcite .    for the correlators with spin @xmath36 and in the chiral limit",
    ", the non - perturbative part has the form @xmath37 where perturbative corrections of order @xmath38 are taken into account , described by coefficients @xmath39 .",
    "some of the nlo coefficients were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 can be related to vacuum expectation values of products of quark and gluon field operators @xcite .",
    "often vacuum dominance or the factorization approximation , which holds , e.g. , in the large-@xmath41 limit , is assumed .",
    "our analysis does not rely on such a representation .",
    "since its discovery , the @xmath8 lepton has been studied with ever - increasing precision at every new @xmath42 collider that has gone into operation .",
    "we are particularly interested in the comprehensive measurements of exclusive hadronic branching ratios from aleph @xcite and of the non - strange spectral functions from aleph @xcite and opal @xcite that have yielded important contributions to studies of perturbative qcd at low energies and , in particular , to the measurement of @xmath43 .",
    "recent measurements of a set of semi - exclusive branching ratios by delphi are also available @xcite , but have not been analyzed to a similar extent . a number of exclusive branching ratio measurements from babar have been reported already @xcite and with more work invested in the understanding of these higher - multiplicity final states we may expect high - precision data for the spectral functions to come also from the b - factories .",
    "we have chosen to use the final data from the aleph collaboration @xcite because , as compared to those available from opal @xcite , they have the smallest experimental errors and provide a larger number of bins .",
    "the spectral functions ( [ specfun ] ) are obtained by dividing the normalised invariant mass - squared distribution of hadronic @xmath8 decays , @xmath44 , for a given hadronic mass @xmath45 by the appropriate kinematic factor .",

    "for larger values of @xmath155 the minimum of @xmath97 becomes larger than 1 , signaling a bad fit .",
    "this behaviour may be due to numerical instabilities and limitations of experimental data ; more important , however , is the fact that in our lo analysis we did not take into account perturbative higher - order corrections : the large perturbative tails of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-correlators become increasingly important when increasing @xmath155 and the sensitivity to the low - energy condensates is lost .    , the upper limit of the space - like interval @xmath74 for @xmath149 . ]    in the case of the @xmath4-correlator , when studying the dependence on @xmath146 , we found that the best simultaneous description of experimental data and theory is obtained when we choose to define the error corridor with the help of the last known term in the perturbation series , i.e. , @xmath160 in contrast , for an error corridor calculated from the next - higher term in the ope , i.e. , using @xmath161 , we observe a less distinct plateau when varying @xmath146 and no stability for the results for @xmath152 .",
    "the fact that with the choice ( [ aerrorchannel ] ) we find very stable fit results for @xmath162 even when increasing @xmath155 beyond the range of the @xmath125-plateau , makes us confident that our results for the @xmath4-correlator are meaningful .",
    "it is , in fact , to be expected that a definition of the error corridor with the help of the higher - dimensional terms in the ope would narrow too fast ( with a power of @xmath163 ) and not leave space enough for perturbative contributions that fall only logarithmically .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath1 channel where perturbative contributions are absent , it was possible to choose tighter error channels given by the omitted next - higher ope term .",
    "we note that the definition of the error channels was the same for all 1- , 2- , and 3-parameter fits in the case of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels , whereas for the @xmath1 channel we had to re - define the error channel when increasing the number of free parameters .",
    "this explains the observation that @xmath125 is not necessarily increasing when going from 1- to 2- and to 3-parameter fits for @xmath1 condensates .",
    "there exists also a well defined plateau for the fitted parameters as a function of @xmath145 . in the analysis we have chosen to use the values @xmath164 gev@xmath103 for @xmath1 and @xmath165 gev@xmath103 for the @xmath4 channel ( see fig .",
    "[ deps1 ] ) .",
    "all these consistency checks were performed for the @xmath3 and @xmath5 channels as well with similar results and we found no justification to change the number of data points @xmath144 used in the analysis or @xmath145 , the upper limit of the space - like interval @xmath74 . also , the dependence on the lower limit @xmath146 has shown that the best simultaneous description of theory and data corresponds to an error corridor defined by the last known term in the perturbative series . for the correlator of the vector current , however , we are not convinced that we have obtained trustworthy results : first , @xmath125 is large even for a 3-parameter fit and , second , the fit results for @xmath166 and @xmath167 change by more than the estimated uncertainties when changing the number of free parameters in the fit .",
