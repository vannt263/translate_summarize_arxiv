    "black hole spin and mass are the fundamental parameters that characterize a supermassive black hole .",

    "hughes & blandford ( 2003 ) consider the coevolution of black hole mass and spin in binary merger scenarios and find that the holes are spun down by mergers .",

    "( 2005 ) study the evolution of the full distribution of black hole spins in hierarchical galaxy formation theories including prolonged gas accretion and binary mergers .",
    "volonteri , sikora , and lasota ( 2007 ) determine and compare spins of black holes in giant elliptical galaxies with those of disk galaxies and show that elliptical galaxies are likely to have higher spins on average than disk galaxies .",
    "king & pringle ( 2006 ) suggest that accretion onto supermassive black holes occurs in a sequence of randomly oriented accretion episodes .",
    "king & pringle ( 2007 ) show that black hole growth that occurs in a series of small - scale randomly oriented accretion events leads to black hole spins that are less than one .",
    "king , pringle , & hofmann ( 2008 ) find that accretion of this type leads to supermassive black holes with moderate spin , and the spin value of an individual black holes may deviate significantly from the mean value .",
    "in addition , the mean spin value of the black hole population decreases slowly as black hole mass increases .",
    "examples of holes with large spin parameter may occur and are most likely to be found in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "berti & volonteri ( 2008 ) show that the redshift evolution of black hole spins for a given population of sources can be used to determine the merger and accretion history of the sources and whether the accretion is prolonged or occurs in short - lived chaotic events .",
    "thus , studies of spin as a function of redshift may be used as a diagnostic of the accretion and merger histories of agn .",
    "spins of individual black holes may be determined by studies quite close to the agn , or by studies of outflows from the agn .",
    "each method of measuring black hole spin is model - dependent .",
    "spins of three objects have been obtained by studies quite close to the heart of the agn from x - ray measurements .",
    "spins obtained using x - ray measurements of agn are @xmath0 for fairall 9 ( schmoll et al .",
    "2009 ) , @xmath1 for agn swift j2127.4 + 5654 ( miniutti et al . 2009 ) , and @xmath2 for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( brenneman & reynolds 2006 ; reynolds & fabian 2008 ) . the use of extended radio sources to study black hole spin is discussed and applied to one radio galaxy by mcnamara et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and to 48 radio galaxies by daly ( 2009a , b ) .",
    "daly ( 2009a ) presents a `` model - independent '' method of placing a lower bound on the black hole spin .",
    "the outflow energy is taken as a lower bound on the black hole spin energy , and this bound is combined with the black hole mass to obtain a lower bound on the black hole spin .",
    "powerful radio galaxies were found to have remarkably similar minimum spin values with a weighted mean of @xmath3 .",
    "mcnamara et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studied the radio galaxy ms0735.6 + 7421 in the context of the hybrid model of meier ( 1999 , 2001 ) and concluded that the outflow is likely powered by the spin energy of a maximally spinning hole .",
    "daly ( 2009b ) studied 48 extended radio galaxies with redshifts between zero and two , including ms0735.6 + 7421 , in the context of the meier ( 1999 , 2001 ) and blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) models of spin energy extraction and obtained an estimate of the spin of each black hole assuming that the magnetic field strength is proportional to the black hole spin ; the black hole spins obtained range from about 0.1 to 1 .",
    "the results suggest that the black hole spin increases slowly with redshift over the redshift range from zero to two .",
    "the work presented here on extended radio sources expands and improves upon prior studies , which included only radio galaxies , in several ways .",
    "a sample of 7 frii quasars is included here , and spin estimates obtained with these sources are compared with results obtained with radio galaxies . in the prior study ,",
    "a magnetic field strength @xmath4 was considered . here",
    ", two additional characterizations of the magnetic field are considered , and results obtained with different field strength characterizations are compared .",
    "in addition , the spin energy per unit black hole mass is obtained for the 7 frii quasars , and a new quantity , the fraction of the spin energy extracted per outflow event is obtained and studied for 7 frii quasars , 19 frii galaxies , and 29 radio sources associated with cd galaxies .    the methods of estimating the black hole spin , the spin energy per unit black hole mass , and the fraction of spin energy extracted per outflow event are described in section 2 , results are presented and discussed in section 3 , and conclusions follow in section 4 .",
    "large - scale radio sources are powered by twin jets that emanate from the agn .",
    "a class of models have been proposed and developed in which the jets are powered in part or in full by the spin energy associated with a rotating black hole and surrounding region ( e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 ; rees 1984 ; begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ; punsly & coroniti 1990 ; blandford 1990 ; meier 1999 , 2001 ; koide et al . 2000 ; mckinney & gammie 2004 ; de villiers et al .. 2005 ; hawley & krolik 2006 ) . in many of these models there",
    "is a relationship between the beam power ( or energy per unit time ) @xmath5 carried by the jet , the black hole mass @xmath6 , spin @xmath7 , and `` braking '' magnetic field strength @xmath8 , which takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is defined in terms of the spin angular momentum @xmath12 , the speed of light @xmath13 , and the black hole mass @xmath6 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "for example , this proportionality applies to the blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) model ( the `` bz '' model ) , the modified bz model discussed by reynolds , garofalo , & begelman ( 2006 ) , and the hybrid model of meier ( 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "thus , if the beam power and black hole mass for a given agn are known , the black hole spin may be studied for various magnetic field strengths ( e.g. blandford 1990 , daly 2009b ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the beam power in units of @xmath18 erg / s , @xmath19 is the poloidal component of the magnetic field that threads the accretion disk and ergosphere in units of @xmath20 g , and @xmath21 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath22 .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath23 varies by a factor of a few for different models ; for example , in the hybrid model of meier ( 1999 ) @xmath24 , while in the model of blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) @xmath25 .",
    "a source with no outflow can still have a significant spin , but only sources with outflows provide the information necessary to deduce the spin . for example , in the magnetic switch model of meier ( 1999 , 2001 ) , the outflow only occurs when the magnetic field strength reaches a particular value .",
    "the black hole spin @xmath7 can be used to determine the black hole spin energy @xmath26 in terms of the black hole mass @xmath6 ( e.g. rees 1984 ) : @xmath27^{1/2 } \\over 2 } \\right)^{1/2 } ~.\\ ] ] the fraction @xmath28 of the spin energy extracted during a particular outflow event may be empirically determined by taking the ratio of the outflow energy @xmath29 to the spin energy : @xmath30    black hole spins , spin energy per unit black hole mass , and the fraction of the spin energy extracted during a particular outflow event are estimated here for sources with empirical determinations of beam power and black hole mass . to obtain these estimates ,",
    "three different characterizations of the magnetic field strength are considered . for each characterization ,",
    "the range and redshift evolution of black hole spin and fraction of spin energy extracted are studied .",
    "the field strengths considered are an eddington magnetic field strength , a constant magnetic field strength , and a magnetic field strength that is proportional to the black hole spin .",
    "these three field strengths are related to the black hole properties in different ways .",
    "interestingly , the overall results and general trends obtained with each characterization are rather similar .",
    "the eddington magnetic field strength is the field strength such that the energy density of the magnetic field is equal to that of a radiation field with an eddington luminosity ( e.g. rees 1984 ; dermer , finke , & menon 2008 ) ; in units of @xmath20 g , @xmath31 .",
    "this is the field strength that is expected for sources radiating at the eddington luminosity .",
    "king ( 2010 ) argues that many agn are likely to be radiating at this luminosity for much of their lives . to evaluate the impact of an assumed characterization of the magnetic field strength on the quantities studied here , we also consider results obtained assuming a constant magnetic field strength .",
    "this possibility has been suggested and considered by several authors ( e.g. rees 1984 ; punsly & coroniti 1990 ; blandford 1990 ) and , more recently , piotrovich et al .",
    ". a characteristic value of @xmath32 , or @xmath33 , is generally adopted , and is used here ; the results obtained here can easily be scaled to any other constant value of the field strength . for comparison , a third characterization of the magnetic field strength is considered . if it is assumed that the fraction of the spin energy extracted per outflow event is constant , then observations of frii radio galaxies indicate that the magnetic field strength is proportional to the black hole spin , @xmath34 ( daly & guerra 2002 ; daly et al . 2009 ) .",
    "interestingly , this is also indicated by a comparison of the beam power predicted in the hybrid model of meier ( 1999 , 2001 ) and empirical results obtained by allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and merloni & heinz ( 2007 ) .",
    "the results of allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and merloni & heinz ( 2007 ) indicate that the beam power is proportional to the accretion rate to the power 1.3 and 1.6 , respectively , while equation ( 12 ) of meier ( 1999 ) indicates that the beam power is proportional to the accretion rate to the power 1.6 when @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it is possible that the field strength is related to the black hole spin , and it is useful to consider this case as a comparison .",
    "the method is applied to 7 powerful frii quasars , 19 powerful frii galaxies , and 29 central dominant ( cd ) galaxies , and includes most sources for which the black hole mass and beam power of the outflow have been empirically determined .",
    "the beam powers and black hole masses for the sources are illustrated in fig . 1 and listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the frii quasars and galaxies have a similar range of beam power and and the quasars have a slightly broader range of black hole mass than the galaxies .",
    "most of the cd galaxies have substantially lower beam powers and extend to lower masses than the frii sources ; this is due to the fact that most of the cd sources are quite nearby and can be observed to relatively low flux levels .",
    "the frii quasars are obtained from the samples of leahy , muxlow , & stephens ( 1989 ) and liu , pooley , & riley ( 1992 ) , and their properties including beam powers are summarized by wellman , daly , & wan ( 1997 ) and wan , daly , & guerra ( 2000 ) .",
    "all quantities have been computed in a standard spatially flat cosmological model with current mean mass density @xmath35 , cosmological constant @xmath36 , and a value of hubble s constant of @xmath37 .",
    "the beam power @xmath5 of the outflow is determined from the pressure of the forward region of the radio lobe , the lobe width , and the rate of growth of the extended lobes by applying the equations of strong shock physics . as noted by odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , this determination of the beam power does not depend upon the offset of the plasma in the radio lobe from minimum energy conditions due to a chance cancellation of the way this offset enters the determination of the beam power .",
    "the total energy that will be expelled by the outflow over its entire lifetime , @xmath29 , is obtained from the beam power using the relation established for powerful radio galaxies @xmath38 ( odea et al .",

    "( 2006 ) from the pressure and volume of the cavity that is occupied by the radio emitting plasma , and the beam powers @xmath5 are obtained by dividing the outflow energy by the buoyancy timescale @xmath40 .",
    "the authors explain that this timescale is probably an overestimate of the true timescale , in which case the beam powers would increase , while the energy of the cavity could be due to multiple outflow events , which would cause the outflow energies and beam powers to decrease .",
    "the source cygnus a ( 3c 405 ) appears in both table 1 and 2 .",
    "the values listed in each table are obtained using independent methods .",
    "the beam power of @xmath41 erg / s listed in table 1 is obtained by applying the equations of strong shock physics to the forward region of the source ( wan , daly , & guerra 2000 ; modified to account for the different cosmological model adopted ) , while the value of @xmath42 erg / s listed in table 2 is obtained by dividing the energy required for the plasma to create and occupy the lobes by the buoyancy timescale ( rafferty et al .",
    "2006 ) ; rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) explain that the beam power obtained in this way may be an underestimate since the buoyancy timescale may be an overestimate .",
    "given that there is only one source that is common to both methods , it is not possible to do a detailed comparison of the methods , and in order to compare results obtained with a given method , values obtained with that method are not modified .",
    "the black hole mass estimates for cygnus a listed in tables 1 and 2 are also obtained with two methods , and are in reasonably good agreement .",
    "the frii galaxies and quasars studied here are the most powerful frii radio sources at their respective redshift , and the hosts have been identified as massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. lilly & longair 1984 ; best , longair , & rottgering 1998 ; mclure et al .",
    "thus , the powerful frii and cd sources studied are likely to be drawn from the same parent population .",
    "since the frii sources represent the most powerful sources are their respective redshifts , they likely represent the envelope of the distribution , while the cd sample contains sources at low redshift with a very broad range of radio powers .",
    "the radio emitting regions of the sources studied are quite large ( typically larger than the optical size of the host galaxy ) , and the timescale of the outflows are estimated to be millions to hundreds of millions of years ( e.g. rafferty et al .",
    "2006 ; odea et al . 2009 ) .",
    "thus , it is the very long term average properties of the outflows that are studied .",
    "the beam powers are obtained by applying the strong shock equations for frii sources , and the pressure confinement equations for radio sources associated with cd galaxies in clusters of galaxies , so beam power determinations do not rely on an empirically or theoretically determined relationship between radio power and beam power .",
    "the sources are very large , with smoothly varying radio emission ; the synchrotron radiation is not doppler boosted or beamed , so there are no relativistic correction factors of this type .",
    "in addition , the overall rate of growth of the sources is not relativistic ( e.g. odea et al 2009 ; rafferty et al .",
    "thus , the use of the large extended radio emitting regions around agn to determine the beam power is relatively simple and straight forward . in this sense , the agn outflows studied here are quite different from those associated with x - ray binaries .",
    "outflows from x - ray binaries can be highly variable on relatively short timescales , and can be strongly affected by doppler boosting and beaming .",
    "the complex nature of outflows from x - ray binaries does not allow the direct application of physical principles to obtain the beam power of each outflow from detailed studies of that outflow ; a theoretically motivated scaling between radio luminosity and beam power is used to obtain the beam power .",
    "the different source properties studied may make it difficult to compare results obtained with large extended radio sources to those obtained with x - ray binaries .",
    "the black hole spin @xmath7 depends upon the beam power , black hole mass , and magnetic field strength , and is determined for each of the three field strengths considered using equation ( 1 ) in the context of the meier ( 1999 , 2001 ) model , labeled @xmath43 .",
    "values of @xmath43 and their uncertainties are listed in tables 1 and 2 , and are shown in figures 2 - 7 . to obtain the fractional uncertainty of @xmath7 ,",

    "the decrease of the black hole spin with decreasing redshift is consistent with the predictions of the models of hughes & blandford ( 2003 ) and king , pringle , & hofmann ( 2008 ) .",
    "this suggests that beam power is directly related to black hole spin .",
    "given the indications of the evolution of spin with redshift for massive elliptical galaxies obtained here , detailed models for the accretion and merger history of the sources and the type of accretion that occurs can be constructed , as discussed by berti & volonteri ( 2008 ) .",
    "clearly , the results presented here are along the lines of the predictions of king , pringle , & hofmann ( 2008 ) in that the mean spin decreases monotonically with decreasing redshift , source to source spins have fluctuations of order @xmath78 , and the spin tends to decrease with increasing black hole mass for the homogeneous sample of 3cr sources ( though this is rather tentative because the black hole mass is an input to the spin determination ) .",
    "consistency between model predictions and the estimated spins suggests that the beam power is directly related to black hole spin .",
    "the fraction of the spin energy extracted per outflow event ranges from about 0.03 to 0.5 for frii quasars and galaxies , and from about 0.002 to about one for radio sources associated with cd galaxies .",
    "the results are consistent with this fraction being independent of redshift .",
    "when this fraction is high , the outflow can significantly modify the spin of the hole , while when this fraction is low , the outflow has a small effect on the black hole spin . in this case",
    ", the merger and accretion history of agn will have a larger impact on black hole spin evolution than the outflow history .",
    "the results obtained here may be considered in light of the work of elvis , risaliti , & zamorani ( 2002 ) , who find that black holes associated with agn that produce the x - ray background must be rapidly spinning , on average , at the time that background is produced .",
    "models developed by gilli , salvati , & hasinger ( 2001 ) suggest that the x - ray background is produced by sources with a range of redshift with much of the background produced by sources with redshift between 1 and 3 .",
    "the elliptical galaxies studied here are found to have high spins at redshift of about 2 , with spins slowly decreasing to lower redshift . if the sources that produce the x - ray background have spins that evolve in a manner similar to those studied here",
    ", the results of elvis , risaliti , & zamorani ( 2002 ) might suggest that the most mild evolution of spin with redshift is favored ; in the context of the current study , this would favor the magnetic field strength @xmath4 , which yields spins that evolve as @xmath79 .",
    "note that this field strength is also favored by a comparison of the empirical results of allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and merloni & heinz ( 2007 ) with spin energy extraction models , as described at the end of section 2 .",
    "another factor that would affect the production of the x - ray background is the normalization of the spin , through the factor @xmath23 .",
    "if the sources that produce the x - ray background have spins similar to those studied here , it would suggest a value of @xmath80 as indicated by the bz model . in this case",
    ", the spins of frii sources vary from values of order unity at a redshift of about 2 to about 0.7 at a redshift of about 0 ( e.g. daly 2009b ) . given the range of redshift of sources contributing to the x - ray background , and the indications from this study that there is a range of spin values at a given redshift for radio sources , a detailed study would have to be carried out to determine whether the sources that produce the x - ray background could have spin normalizations and redshift evolution similar to those obtained here for radio sources .",
    "the spin values obtained here for agn are in good agreement with typical spin values reported for x - ray binary systems , which are summarized by fender et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . studies of x - ray binaries have not indicated a link between black hole spin and the properties of the jets ( steiner et al .",
    "2010 ; fender et al .",
    "2010 ; gou et al .",
    "2010 ) , except for a correlation between the transient jet normalization and spin ( fender et al .",
    "according to fender et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the lack of a relationship between jet properties and spin for x - ray binaries could be due to a problem with the jet properties or speed determinations ; a problem with the spin measurements ; or a real lack of dependence of jet properties on spin",
    ". studies of agn suggest a link between the beam power of large - scale outflows and black hole spin ( sikora , stawarz , & lasota 2007 ) . to date , the samples studied are rather small , and very different parts of the systems are used to study the jet properties of x - ray binaries and the beam powers of agn , as described in section 3.1 .",
    "thus , it is not clear how significant the differences are between the relationship of beam power and spin for agn and the relationship of jet properties and spin for x - ray binaries .",
    "if differences truly exist , it might suggest that more than one mechanism may lead to the formation of jets from the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "in related work , fernandes et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied powerful radio galaxies , concluding that the accreted energy is channeled into jets with maximum efficiency for the most powerful sources , and suggesting that black hole spin plays a dominant role in the production of jets .",
    "punsly ( 2010 ) compared jet efficiencies with currently popular `` no net flux '' models of spin energy extraction and found that these models could not account for the empirically determined jet efficiencies .",
    "the detailed study of kovacs , gergely , & biermann ( 2010 ) suggests that efficient jets can be produced in the context of the bz model of spin energy extraction .",
    "overall , the results obtained with powerful 3cr quasars are consistent with those obtained with 3cr galaxies .",
    "the sample of quasars studied is small and larger samples of quasars are needed to quantify this result .",
    "the quasar sample studied has a black hole mass range that is larger than that of the 3cr galaxies studied and a dearth of black hole masses that overlap those of the galaxies .",
    "there is a hint that the quasars may lie at the edges of the distribution of spins for 3cr sources at a given redshift , and this might be related to black hole mass .",
    "this can be tested with larger quasars samples , and with samples of powerful radio galaxies with a broader range of black hole mass .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank laura brenneman , kris beckwith , preeti kharb , brian mcnamara , chris reynolds , and chris odea for interesting and helpful discussions of this work .",
    "i would also like to thank the referee and editor for helpful comments and suggestions ."
