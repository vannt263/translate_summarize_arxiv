    "there is increasing evidence that grbs are due to the collapse of massive stars ( see , e.g. , [ 1 ] for a discussion of this evidence ) .",
    "if grbs are indeed related to the collapse of massive stars , one expects the grb rate to be roughly proportional to the sfr .",
    "however , the observed redshift distribution of grbs differs noticeably from that of the sfr : the observed grb redshift distribution peaks at @xmath2 and few bursts are observed beyond @xmath3 , while the sfr peaks at @xmath4 and 10 - 40% of stars are thought to form beyond @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , [ 2,3 , ] ) .    however , observational selection effects play an important role in determining the observed redshift distribution of grbs .",
    "the important question is therefore whether or not the discrepancy between the observed grb redshift distribution and the redshift dependence of the sfr is entirely due to selection effects ; i.e. , is the grb rate roughly proportional to the sfr after taking observational selection effects into account ?",
    "we address this question in this paper .    -8pt",
    "+     +    -10pt",
    "we adopt a bayesian approach .",
    "we calculate the likelihood of the data given the model , and convert it to a posterior distribution on the model parameters .",
    "we assume a very general model for the grb rate , and a power - law model for the intrinsic grb photon luminosity distribution ( we assume that the amplitude and the power - law index of the photon luminosity distribution does not evolve ; we relax this assumption in future work ) .",
    "we determine the efficiency with which bepposax and the ipn detect grbs as a function of peak photon flux @xmath6 by comparing the bepposax and ipn peak photon flux distributions to that of batse .",
    "we fit the model jointly to the peak fluxes and redshifts of the 14 grbs with known @xmath0 , and the 7 grbs for which there are constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "we write the rate of grbs that occur per unit redshift and luminosity as -2pt @xmath7 -5pt where @xmath8 is the rate of grbs that occur at redshift @xmath0 , -2pt @xmath9^p \\exp\\left[q\\left(1-{{t(z ) } \\over { t(0)}}\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] is the rate of grbs that occur at redshift @xmath0 per unit comoving volume ( see @xcite ) , @xmath10 is the elapsed time since the big bang , and -2pt @xmath11 is the intrinsic photon luminosity distribution of grbs .",
    "thus the model has five parameters : @xmath6 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "+     + -17pt    -15pt    we write the efficiency with which grbs with known redshifts are found as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the efficiency with which the redshifts of grbs are determined from optical observations once they are detected by a @xmath18-ray burst instrument .",
    "we take @xmath19 for grbs whose redshifts were determined by detection of an absorption - line system in the optical afterglow of the burst and @xmath20 for grbs whose redshifts were determined by measuring emission lines in the spectra of the host galaxy .",
    "the latter expression accounts qualitatively for the difficulty in measuring redshifts when the @xmath21 and o[ii ] emission lines from host galaxies do not lie in the visible spectrum .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is the `` stereo - temporal '' efficiency that accounts for limitations of exposure in time and solid angle and @xmath23 is the efficiency with which batse , the ipn and bepposax detect grbs as a function of peak flux @xmath6 .",
    "figure 1 compare the best - fit models of @xmath24 and the cumulative peak flux distributions of batse , the ipn , and bepposax , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the best - fit @xmath24 for each of the three experiments .    the likelihood function",
    "is then given by -6pt @xmath25 -4pt where -12pt @xmath26 is the expected number of events observed within @xmath27 of @xmath28 .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is the burst spectral index , which we set equal to one in this work . by an application of bayes theorem",
    ", we now regard @xmath30 as an ( unnormalized ) probability distribution on the model parameters .",
    "figure 3 shows 68% and 95% probability contours for the grb rate parameters @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "also shown on the plots are the best - fit sfr models of madau et al .",
    "[ 4 ] and rowan - robinson [ 5 ] .",
    "the sfr models lie at about a 68% excursion from the best - fit grb rate model .",
    "thus we find that , despite the qualitative differences that exist between the observed grb rate and estimates of the sfr in the universe , current data are consistent with the actual grb rate being approximately proportional to the sfr .",
