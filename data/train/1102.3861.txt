    "the first equivalence follows since one can glue together local connections on the northern and southern hemispheres of @xmath18 , with suitable boundary conditions at infinity in @xmath10 , to produce a global instanton  @xcite .",
    "the second equivalence is known as the _ hitchin  kobayashi correspondence _ and it gives a construction of the instanton moduli space in algebraic geometry  @xcite .",
    "the third equivalence gives an explicit construction of the instanton connections on @xmath10 through solutions of the celebrated adhm matrix equations  @xcite .",
    "the fourth equivalence yields the _ atiyah  penrose  ward twistor correspondence _ which can be used to explicitly construct instantons on @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the anti - self - duality equations ( [ asdeqs ] ) have a natural generalization to higher - dimensional khler manifolds @xmath3 called the donaldson  uhlenbeck  yau equations  @xcite .",
    "irreducible gauge connections which solve these equations are in one - to - one correspondence with stable holomorphic vector bundles over @xmath3 ; they naturally arise in compactifications of heterotic string theory as the condition for at least one unbroken supersymmetry in the low - energy effective field theory .",
    "of particular interest are the cases in which @xmath3 is a toric manifold , like the original example @xmath19 . in this case , the torus symmetries of @xmath3 lift to the instanton moduli space and the powerful techniques of equivariant localization can be used to compute the exact instanton contributions to the partition functions of supersymmetric gauge theories on @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "besides their intrinsic interest as exactly solvable models which capture physical regimes of more realistic quantum field theories , these partition functions also enumerate bps bound states of d - branes in type  ii string theory in certain regions of the moduli space .",

    "the enumeration of instantons on a general toric @xmath22-fold @xmath3 in the approach of  @xcite is somewhat heuristic .",
    "it begins with the _ local _ enumeration of ( generalized ) noncommutative instantons on each torus invariant open patch @xmath23 .",
    "a moyal deformation of these patches is simple enough to enable explicit construction of the instanton connections in this case , whose contributions to the partition function can then be assembled to global quantities using the gluing rules of ( commutative ) toric geometry .",
    "this construction gives rise to a crystalline structure of spacetime , which as an integrable model of lattice statistical mechanics has many interesting features in its own right .",
    "we will interpret this crystal model as a quantization of spacetime geometry at the planck scale , induced by quantum gravitational fluctuations which are effectively encoded in the dynamics of noncommutative instantons .",
    "when @xmath24 we will give a very precise dynamical realization of all these correspondences , while for @xmath25 we can give an explicit construction of the instanton moduli space and its associated gauge connections .",
    "although this heuristic picture is nice and certainly very useful , one would like to go beyond it somewhat by finding a _ global _ notion of `` noncommutative toric variety '' , and the construction of instantons thereon .",
    "this would cast the picture of dynamical quantum geometry into the more precise and rigorous framework of noncommutative geometry .",
    "another reason is that such varieties naturally arise in string geometry .",
    "for example , chiral fermions on a `` quantum curve '' can be embedded in string theory as a collection of intersecting d - branes in a background supergravity @xmath26-field .",
    "such a configuration is described mathematically by a holonomic @xmath27-module  @xcite , roughly speaking a representation or sheaf over an algebra of differential operators . in certain instances",
    ", there is an equivalence between categories of @xmath27-modules and of modules on a noncommutative variety .",
    "our constructions give examples of such noncommutative varieties , and hence of the quantum geometries eluded to in  @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of this correspondence is between the right ideals of the weyl algebra @xmath28 $ ] , the algebra of differential operators on the affine line , and line bundles on a noncommutative @xmath13  @xcite . in turn",
    ", vector bundles on noncommutative @xmath13 correspond to instantons on a noncommutative @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "hence the construction of instantons on noncommutative toric varieties produces a sharper picture of the dynamically induced quantum geometry .",
    "in this section we introduce the melting crystal model and describe its statistical mechanics .",
    "we relate it to enumerative problems in combinatorics and toric geometry , and explain its interpretation in string theory .",
    "we then relate the model to an integrable hierarchy and recast it as a matrix model , which leads into our first gauge theory characterization of the crystal in terms of chern  simons theory .",
    "we defer describing the relationship with noncommutative instantons to later sections , and begin with the three - dimensional case wherein the complete story is best understood .      the model of a melting crystal corner was introduced in  @xcite and is depicted in fig .",

    "removing each atom from the corner of the crystal contributes a factor @xmath35 to the boltzmann weight , where @xmath36 is the chemical potential and @xmath37 is the temperature .    we can map this model onto a combinatorial problem by piling cubes in the corner of a room as they are removed from the crystal .",

    "such an object is called a _ plane partition _ or _ three - dimensional young diagram_.    plane partitions generalize the notion of ordinary partition or young diagram ; recall that this is an increasing sequence of positive integers , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 gives the length of the @xmath47-th row in the associated ferrers diagrams of the semi - standard young tableaux @xmath37 of shape @xmath48 .",
    "there are in fact two ways in which ordinary partitions will play a role .",
    "firstly , the `` diagonal slices '' of a plane partition @xmath41 , @xmath49 , define a sequence of ordinary partitions obeying `` interlacing relations '' .",
    "secondly , we can consider three - dimensional young diagrams with infinitely many boxes which freeze along each coordinate direction to a two - dimensional young diagram projected in the respective coordinate plane .",
    "the statistical mechanics of crystal melting is now defined in a canonical ensemble in which each plane partition @xmath41 has energy proportional to the total number of cubes @xmath50 .",
    "the canonical partition function is then the generating function for plane partitions and is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of plane partitions @xmath41 with @xmath53 boxes .",

    "we begin by defining the noncommutative klein quadric @xmath360 which is a special instance of the construction of noncommutative grassmann varieties given in  @xcite .",
    "consider the exterior algebra @xmath361 of a four - dimensional vector space which is a left @xmath217-comodule .",

    "firstly , to ensure existence of the embedding @xmath367 we must regard these minors as homogeneous coordinates on the noncommutative projective space , which imposes the consistency condition on the deformation parameters @xmath368 and hence restricts the allowed ambient varieties @xmath369 ( contrary to the commutative case ) . secondly , we must restrict the homogeneous coordinates @xmath363 of the projective space to the embedding @xmath370 .",
    "this constraint is imposed via noncommutative laplace expansions of the minors , and in this case leaves only one non - trivial relation , the quadratic _ noncommutative plcker relation _",

    "for this , we restrict the deformation parameters to @xmath373 and @xmath374 otherwise .",

    "the connes  landi spheres are uniquely singled out by their cohomology , but this does not apply to complex deformations like ours .",
    "it would be interesting to understand these spheres in further detail , by studying their cyclic cohomology and how they are singled out as real slices inside the noncommutative grassmannians .",
    "the noncommutative twistor transform is constructed by means of the twistor correspondence [ twistorcorr]where the algebra @xmath383 of the projective three - space is the `` noncommutative twistor algebra '' , and @xmath384 is the noncommutative partial flag variety which is most conveniently described via the braided tensor product  @xcite @xmath385 we will construct instantons on @xmath372 by using the _ twistor transform _ which is the morphism from @xmath383-modules to @xmath377-modules given by @xmath386_{\\rm diag } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the definition of pushforward along the correspondence diagram ( [ twistorcorr ] ) is explained in  @xcite .    the final ingredient required for the construction of noncommutative instantons is the notion of self - conjugate instanton modules .",
