    "stabilization in control systems with uncertainties depending on state and input has attracted the interest of many researchers .",
    "uncertainties depending on state originate from various sources , including variations in plant parameters and inaccuracies that arise from identification .",
    "input uncertainties include uncertain gains , dead zone nonlinearities , quantization , and backlash . in practice",
    ", these uncertainties may degrade or destabilize system performance .",
    "for example , given that aerodynamic parameters are functions of flight conditions , some aircraft are nonlinear and undergo rapid parameter variations .",
    "these attributes stem from the fact that aircraft can operate in a wide range of aerodynamic conditions . as a result ,",
    "aerodynamic parameters , which exist in system and input matrices @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , are inherently uncertain",
    ". therefore , robust stabilization control problems for systems with uncertainties depending on both state and input are important .    in this paper , a stabilization control problem",
    "is investigated for a class of multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) systems subject to nonparametric time - varying uncertainties with respect to both state and input .",
    "several accepted control methods for handling uncertainties are briefly reviewed .",
    "a direct approach is to estimate all unknown parameters , and then simultaneously use such parameters to resolve uncertainties .",
    "lyapunov methods are adopted in analyzing the stability of closed - loop systems . in @xcite ,",
    "nonparametric uncertainties involving state and input are approximated via basis functions with unknown parameters , which are estimated by given adaptive laws .",
    "with the estimated parameters , an approximate dynamic inversion method was proposed .",
    "it is in fact an adaptive dynamic inversion method @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite , @xmath0 adaptive control architecture",
    "was proposed for systems with an unknown input gain , as well as unknown time - varying parameters and disturbances . in @xcite ,",
    "adaptive feedback control was used to track the desired angular velocity trajectory of a planar rigid body with unknown rotational inertia and unknown input nonlinearity . in @xcite",
    ", two asymptotic tracking controllers were designed for the output tracking of an aircraft system under parametric uncertainties and unknown nonlinear disturbances , which are not linearly parameterizable .",
    "an adaptive extension was then presented , in which the feedforward adaptive estimates of input uncertainties are used . as indicated in @xcite-@xcite",
    ", adaptive controllers may require numerous integrators that correspond to unknown parameters in an uncertain system .",
    "each unknown parameter requires an integrator for estimation , thereby resulting in a closed - loop system with a reduced stability margin .",
    "in addition , the estimates may not approach real parameters without the persistent excitation of signals , which are difficult to generate in practice , particularly under numerous unknown parameters @xcite .",
    "the second direct method for resolving uncertainties is designing inverse control by a neural network that cancels input nonlinearities , thereby generating a linear function @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in contrast to traditional inverse control schemes , a neural network approximates an unknown nonlinear term @xcite .",
    "neural network methods can also be considered as adaptive control methods , except that they have different basis functions .",
    "thus , they also have the same problems as those encountered in adaptive control methods .",
    "the third approach is adopting sliding mode control , which presents inherent fast response and insensitivity to plant parameter variation and/or external perturbation . in @xcite , a new sliding mode control law based on the measurability of all system states",
    "was presented .",
    "the law ensures global reach conditions of the sliding mode for systems subject to nonparametric time - varying uncertainties with respect to both state and input .",
    "along this idea of @xcite , an output feedback controller was further proposed in @xcite .",
    "sliding mode controllers essentially rely on infinite gains to achieve good tracking performance , which is not always feasible in practice . in practice , moreover , switching will consume energy and may excite high - frequency modes .    to overcome these drawbacks , this paper proposes a stabilization approach that involves dynamic inversion based on additive state decomposition ( asd ) .",
    "additive state decomposition @xcite is different from the lower - order subsystem decomposition methods existing in the literature . concretely , taking the system @xmath1 for example , it is decomposed into two subsystems : @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4and@xmath5 respectively .",
    "the lower - order subsystem decomposition satisfies @xmath6 and @xmath7 by contrast , the proposed additive state decomposition satisfies @xmath8 and@xmath9 the key idea of the proposed method is that it combines nonparametric time - varying uncertainties with respect to both state and input into one disturbance by asd .",
    "such a disturbance is then compensated for .",
    "the proposed controller is continuous and enables asymptotic stability in the presence of time - invariant uncertainties .",
    "moreover , by choosing a special filter , the proposed controllers can be finally replaced by proportional - integral ( pi ) controllers .",
    "this is consistent with the controller form in @xcite for a similar problem .",
    "however , compared with @xcite , the considered plant , analysis method and design procedure are all different , especially the analysis method and design procedure .",
    "the bound on a parameter , corresponding to the singular perturbation parameter in @xcite , is also given explicitly .",
    "moreover , our proposed controllers are not just in the form of pi controllers .",
    "this paper focuses on a stabilization problem , which distinguishes it from the authors previous work on asd . in previous research",
    ", asd has been applied to tracking problems for nonlinear systems without stabilization problems or with the stabilization problem being solved by a simple state feedback controller @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the other additive decomposition , namely additive output decomposition @xcite , is also applied to a tracking problem with a stable controlled plant .",
    "consider a class of mimo systems subject to nonparametric time - varying uncertainties with respect to both state and input as follows:@xmath10 where @xmath11 is the system state ( taken as a measurable output ) , @xmath12  is the control , @xmath13 is a known matrix , @xmath14 is a known constant matrix , @xmath15 is an unknown nonlinear vector function , and @xmath16  is an unknown nonlinear time - varying disturbance . for system ( [ perturbedsystem ] ) , the following assumptions are made .    *",
