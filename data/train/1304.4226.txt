    "the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is one of the most popular ways to probe the density fluctuations in the universe .",
    "spatial distributions of galaxies and other astronomical objects which can be observed reflect the underlying density fluctuations in the universe .",
    "in cosmology , it is crucial to investigate the spatial distributions of dark matter , which dominates the mass of the universe .",
    "unfortunately , distributions of dark matter are difficult to directly observe , because the only interaction we know that the dark matter surely has is the gravitational interaction . consequently , we need to estimate the density fluctuations of the universe by means of indirect probes such as galaxies , which have electromagnetic interactions .",
    "relations between distributions of observable objects and those of dark matter are nontrivial . on very large scales where the linear theory can be applied , the relations are reasonably represented by the linear bias ;",
    "the density contrasts of dark matter @xmath0 and those of observable objects @xmath1 are proportional to each other , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a constant called the bias parameter .",
    "however , nonlinear effects can not be neglected when we extract cosmological information as much as possible from observational data of lss , and bias relations in nonlinear regime are not as simple as those in linear regime .",

    "elucidating nonlinear effects on observables in lss has crucial importance in the precision cosmology .",
    "while strongly nonlinear phenomena are difficult to analytically quantify , the perturbation theory is useful in understanding quasi - nonlinear regime .",
    "the traditional perturbation theory describes evolutions of mass density field on large scales where the density fluctuations are small .",
    "however , spatial distributions of astronomical objects such as galaxies do not exactly follow the mass density field , and they are biased tracers .",
    "formation processes of astronomical objects are governed by strongly nonlinear dynamics including baryon physics etc .",
    ", which can not be straightforwardly treated by the traditional perturbation theory .    even though the tracers are produced through strongly nonlinear processes , it is still sensible to apply the perturbation theory to study lss on large scales .",
    "for example , the biasing effect in linear theory is simply represented by a bias parameter @xmath3 as described above . however , biasing effects in higher - order perturbation theory are not that simple .",
    "a popular model of the biasing in the context of nonlinear perturbation theory is the eulerian local bias @xcite .",
    "this model employs freely fitting parameters in every orders of perturbations , and is just a phenomenological model because the eulerian bias is not definitely local in reality .",
    "the integrated perturbation theory ( ipt ) @xcite is a framework of the perturbation theory to predict observable power spectra and any higher - order polyspectra ( or the correlation functions ) of nonlocally biased tracers .",
    "in addition , the effects of redshift - space distortions and primordial non - gaussianity are naturally incorporated .",
    "this theory is general enough so that any model of nonlocal bias can be taken into account .",
    "precise mechanisms of bias are still not theoretically understood well , and are under active investigations .",
    "the framework of ipt separates the known physics of gravitational effects on spatial clustering from the unknown physics of complicated bias .",
    "the unknown physics of nonlocal bias is packed into `` renormalized bias functions '' @xmath7 in the ipt formalism .",
    "once the renormalized bias functions are modeled for observable tracers , weakly nonlinear effects of gravitational evolutions are taken care of by the ipt .",
    "the ipt is a generalization of a previous formulation called lagrangian resummation theory ( lrt ) @xcite in which only local models of lagrangian bias can be incorporated .    in recent developments ,",
    "the model of bias from the halo approach has turned out to be quite useful in understanding the cosmological structure formations @xcite . the halo bias is naturally incorporated in the framework of ipt",
    ". predictions of ipt combined with the halo model of bias do not contain any fitting parameter once the mass function and physical mass of halos are specified .",
    "this property is quite different from other phenomenological approaches to combine the perturbation theory and bias models .",
    "a concept of nonlocal lagrangian bias has recently attracted considerable attention @xcite . extending the halo approach , a simple nonlocal model of lagrangian bias",
    "is recently proposed @xcite for applications to the ipt . applying this nonlocal model of halo bias to evaluating the scale - dependent bias in the presence of primordial non - gaussianity , not",
    "only the results of peak - background split are reproduced , but also more general formula is obtained . in this paper , the usage of this simple model of nonlocal halo bias in the framework of ipt is explicitly explained .",
    "the bias in the framework of ipt does not have to be a halo bias .",
    "there are many kinds of tracers for lss , such as various types of galaxies , quasars , ly-@xmath8 absorption lines , 21 cm absorption and emission lines , etc .",
    "once the bias model for each kind of objects is given , it is straightforward to calculate biased power spectra and polyspectra of those tracers in the framework of ipt .",
    "as described above , it is needless to say that detailed mechanisms of bias for those tracers have not been fully understood yet .",
    "as emphasized above , the ipt separates the difficult problems of fully nonlinear biasing from gravitational evolutions in weakly nonlinear regime .    while the basic formulation of ipt is developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , explicit calculations of the nonlinear power spectra are not given in that reference .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give explicit expressions of biased power spectra with an arbitrary model of nonlocal bias in the one - loop approximations , in which leading - order corrections to the nonlinear evolutions are included .",
    "the expressions are given both in real space and in redshift space .",
    "three - dimensional integrals in the formal expressions of one - loop power spectra are reduced to one- and two - dimensional integrals , which are easy and convenient for numerical integrations .",

    "physical meanings of the graphs are as follows : a double solid line corresponds to the number density field @xmath13 , a square box represents partial resummations of dynamics and biasing , a wavy line represents the displacement field , a black dot represents nonlinear evolutions of the displacement field , a crossed circle represents the primordial spectra . the procedures for obtaining a cross polyspectra @xmath232 of different types of objects @xmath233 are listed below .",
    "auto polyspectra are obtained by just setting @xmath234 .",
    "the power spectrum is a special case of polyspectra with @xmath235 .      1 .",

    "label each double solid line with an outgoing wavevector that corresponds to an argument of the polyspectra @xmath238 .",
    "2 .   consider possible ways to connect all the square boxes by using wavy lines , solid lines , black dots and crossed circles , satisfying following constraints : 1 .",
    "an end of a wavy line should be connected to a square box , and the other end should be connected to a black dot .",
    "an end of a solid line should be connected to a crossed circle , and the other end should be connected to either a square box or a black dot .",
    "3 .   only one wavy line can be attached to a black dot while arbitrary number of solid line(s ) can be attached to a black dot .",
    "4 .   a piece of graph which is connected to a single square box with only wavy lines or with only solid lines is not allowed .",
    "3 .   label each ( solid and wavy ) line with a wavevector and its direction .",
    "the wavevectors should be conserved at each vertex of square box , black dot , and crossed circle .",
    "label each wavy line with spatial index together with a wavevector .",
    "4 .   apply the diagrammatic rules of figs .",
    "[ fig : iptdiag1 ] and [ fig : iptdiag2 ] to every distinct graphs .",
    "5 .   integrate over wavevectors as @xmath239 , where @xmath240 are not determined by constraints of wavevector conservation at vertices .",

    "sum up all the contributions from every distinct graphs up to necessary orders of perturbations .",
    "the rule 2.-(d ) is due to partial resummations of the square box .",

    "[ fig : vertexex ] is allowed .",
    "there is a piece of graph that is connected to a single square box with both wavy and solid lines .",
    "however , the right diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vertexex ] is not allowed , because of double reasons .",
    "one is that the upper piece of graph is connected to a single square box with only wavy lines .",
    "the other is that the lower piece of graph with only solid lines connected to a single square box .",
