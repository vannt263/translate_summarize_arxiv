    "given that the existence of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 was only announced in january of 2001 , @xcite there has been an explosive growth in humanity s understanding of the basic physical properties of this simple binary compound over the past two years .",
    "at this point in time there is a consensus about most of the fundamental properties of this material and a rapidly growing understanding of , as well as appreciation for , the dramatic differences between this extreme example of bcs superconductivity and other , older examples of intermetallic superconductivity .    in this paper",
    "we will summarize the status of our experimental understanding of the basic properties associated with the normal and superconducting states of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "all of the data presented in this paper comes from measurements of polycrystalline samples of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "two basic types of samples were used : sintered pellets and wire segments . both types of samples were synthesized by exposing boron to mg vapor at , or near , 950@xmath1c .",
    "the sintered pellets were made by combining stoichiometric amounts of high purity magnesium and isotopically pure boron and reacting them in a sealed ta tube .",
    "@xcite the wire segments were made by using a different initial form of boron : boron filament . in this case",
    "the boron filament was exposed to magnesium vapor by sealing it in a ta tube with excess mg and heating to or near 950@xmath1c .",
    "@xcite this same method has been used to transform thin films of boron into mgb@xmath0 thin films .",
    "@xcite as those skilled in the art will realize , the steps outlined above provide a form preserving method of turning boron objects ( filaments , films , tapes ) into mgb@xmath0 objects with similar morphologies .",
    "@xcite polycrystalline mgb@xmath0 synthesized in this manner is single - phased and , as will be discussed below , manifests the properties of a high purity sample .",
    "further details about sample synthesis can be found in references @xcite as well as the paper by ribeiro _",
    "_ in this volume .",
    "virtually all the measurements presented in this paper were performed on quantum design mpsm-5 , mpms-7 , and ppms-9 machines .",
    "electrical contact was made to the samples by using epotek h20e silver epoxy and pt wires .",
    "high field magneto - transport data was measured at the national high magnetic field laboratory in los alamos for magnetic field up to 18 t. @xcite",
    "immediately after the announcement of the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 the first question that had to be addressed was one of mechanism . whereas most researchers experienced with intermetallic compounds assumed that mgb@xmath0 was the long sought after , extreme example of phonon - mediated , bcs superconductivity , some researchers , steeped in the lore of high-@xmath2 oxides , assumed that a 40 k superconductor had to stem from a more exotic coupling mechanism .",
    "the simplest way to shed light on this question was to measure the boron isotope shift of @xmath2 .",
    "looking at boron rather than magnesium was motivated by physical , economic and time considerations . given the high @xmath2 of @xmath340 k it seemed likely that the lightest ( as well as most prevalent ) element would be responsible for the phonons associated with the pairing of electrons .",
    "in addition , isotopically pure boron is relatively cheap given its natural abundance ( @xmath380@xmath4 @xmath5b and 20@xmath4 @xmath6b ) and the fact that its light atomic weight allow for separation via diffusion rather than requiring mass spectroscopy .",
    "this fact means that many materials preparation labs , particularly ones working with neutron scatters ( who require the use on non - absorbing @xmath5b ) , have supplies of isotopically pure boron on hand .",
    "figure [ f1 ] presents temperature dependent electrical resistance and magnetization data taken on mg@xmath5b@xmath0 and mg@xmath6b@xmath0 samples .",
    "a clear 1.0 k shift in @xmath2 can be seen in both measurements .",
    "specific heat data ( not shown ) taken on the same samples show the same 1.0 k shift.@xcite this 1.0 k shift is to be compared with the simple prediction of the bcs model , @xmath7 @xmath3 0.85 k , based upon @xmath8 1/(formula unit mass)@xmath9 .",
    "the partial isotope exponent for boron is @xmath10 = 0.26 .",
    "@xcite . these data by themselves",
    "are not proof that cooper pair formation in mgb@xmath0 is mediated by phonons , but it is consistent with it and strongly reinforced the idea that mgb@xmath0 was an extreme example of phonon - mediated bcs superconductivity .",
    "subsequent measurements @xcite confirmed the boron isotope shift and found that there was virtually no magnesium isotope shift .",
    "all of the isotope shift data have subsequently explained within the context of phonon - mediated , bcs superconductivity . @xcite .",
    "once the question of mechanism has been addressed , the next set of questions that arise concern the basic properties associated with both the normal and superconducting state .",
    "let s start with electrical transport .",
    "figure [ f2 ] ( upper panel ) presents the temperature dependent resistance of a piece of sintered pellet for various values of applied magnetic field .",
    "given that the density of the sintered pellet is not close to 100@xmath4 we can only estimate the resistivity of mgb@xmath0 at 42 k to be @xmath3 1 @xmath11-cm based on these data .",
    "on the other hand what can be clearly seen is that there is a substantial loose of scattering associated with cooling the sample from 300 k down to 40 k. in fact the residual resistivity ratio ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13(300 k)/@xmath13(42 k ) , is close to 20 .",
    "a consequence of this very low , normal state resistance is the substantial magneto - resistance observed in the normal state .",
    "these effects can be seen even more clearly in the temperature dependent resistivity data from the mgb@xmath0 wire segment ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , lower panel ) . given a sample density of better than 95@xmath4 combined with a well - defined geometry",
    "the resistivity can be easily determined : e.g. @xmath14(300 k ) = 9.6 @xmath11-cm and @xmath14(40 k ) = 0.38 @xmath11-cm .",
    "the temperature dependence of the wire sample is quantitatively similar to that seen for the sintered pellet and it manifests the same , large , normal - state magneto - resistivity .",
    "the value of the low temperature , normal - state resistivity is important for two rather different reasons .",
    "if we take @xmath15 = 4.8@xmath16 cm / s we can extract an electronic mean free path of @xmath17 @xmath3 600 @xmath18 . @xcite as will be shown below , when this length scale is compared to the superconducting coherence length , @xmath19 , it becomes clear that mgb@xmath0 is deep in the clean limit of superconductivity , i.e. @xmath20 . a low resistivity is also very important for possible applications , specifically high current ones .",
    "an intrinsically small , low - temperature , normal state resistivity means that there is far less chance of quenching magnets made from this material .",
    "figure [ f3 ] presents the normal state magneto - transport data , shown in part in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] as well as the inset of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , in the form of a kohler plot .",
    "@xcite the fact that all of these data fall onto a single manifold is consistent with mgb@xmath0 being a simple ( @xmath21 and @xmath22band ) metal with a single salient scattering time in the normal state .",
    "these data , along with the isotope effect data , help demonstrate that mgb@xmath0 is indeed a representative example of intermetallic superconductivity , i.e. there is no need for more exotic , high-@xmath2-like , theoretical explainations .    it should be noted though , that whereas we have had no difficulty in preparing high - purity , low resistivity , polycrystalline samples of mgb@xmath0 , other groups had difficulty in reproducing these results .",
    "residual resistivity values as high as 70 @xmath11-cm @xcite or 20 @xmath11-cm @xcite have been reported .",
    "in addition it was suggested that metallic magnesium in parallel with the mgb@xmath0 could be responsible for the low resistivities we have found .",
    "@xcite this controversy spurred us to examine the possible sources of this apparent variation in sample quality ( see reference @xcite as well as paper by r. ribeiro _ et al .",
    "_ in this volume ) .",
    "we found that the use of very high purity boron is vital to the formation of low resistivity samples .",
    "we also found that for the stiochiometric pellets as well as the wire segments formed via exposure to boron filament to mg vapor the low resistivity is not associated with free magnesium , but rather is an intrinsic feature of high purity mgb@xmath0 .",
    "fortunately as more and more data on mgb@xmath0 ( polycrystals , films , and single crystals ) becomes available there values of both room temperature and residual resistivity are asymptotically approaching the values presented in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . @xcite    the magneto - transport data shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] can also be used to extract information about the superconducting state , specifically the upper critical field , @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath23 data are plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath23 rises to slightly above 16 t at 1.5 k. @xcite from this value we can extract an estimate of @xmath19 of @xmath3 50 @xmath18 , a value that is indeed much less than the electronic mean free path , @xmath17 @xmath3 600 @xmath18 .",
    "as mentioned above , given that @xmath20 , mgb@xmath0 is deep within the clean limit of superconductivity .",
    "there are several other field scales of interest : the irreversibility field , @xmath24 and the thermodynamic critical field , @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ f5 ] presents @xmath26 data that clearly show the irreversibility field for representative temperatures .",
    "the @xmath27 curve deduced from these data is presented as the lower curve in fig .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath24 is approximately one half of @xmath28 . whereas the values of @xmath28(1.5 k ) @xmath3 16 t and @xmath24(5 k ) @xmath3 7 t are neither very low nor very high , there are already examples of dirtier samples for which the low temperature @xmath28",
    "@xmath3 30 t and the low temperature @xmath24 @xmath3 15 t. @xcite one of the current , key areas of applied research on mgb@xmath0 is focusing on the attempt to understand how pinning , as well as @xmath29 , in this material can be simply and reproducibly controlled .",
    "the thermodynamic critical field can be inferred , at least for @xmath30 near @xmath2 , from magnetization loops . @xcite the inset to fig .",
    "[ f6 ] presents @xmath31 for @xmath30 close to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath31 was determined by integrating the area under the equilibrium magnetization versus field curve where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the increasing field magnetization and decreasing field magnetization respectively .",
    "@xcite the @xmath31 data can be used to estimate another length scale , the london penetration depth , @xmath35 , by using the simple relations @xmath36",
    "= \\lambda/\\xi_0 $ ] . using the @xmath23 data from fig .",
    "[ f4 ] as well as the @xmath31 data from fig .",
    "[ f6 ] we find that @xmath29 @xmath3 25 and @xmath35 @xmath3 1400 @xmath18 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath35 and @xmath29 derived above are average values .",
    "there has been no effort made to account for the anisotropy associated with the hexagonal unit cell of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "this means that these values should be taken as bench marks rather than definitive , final values .",
    "the reason for this caveat is the fact that there are very large anisotropies in many of the properties of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "perhaps the most conspicuous is the anisotropy in the value of @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite whereas early estimates of this anisotropy , @xmath37 , were rather low ( @xmath38 = 1.73 ) , @xcite measurements on unoriented , high purity powders allowed us to determine the anisotropic @xmath23 in detail .",
    "@xcite figure [ f7 ] presents the temperature dependence of the anisotropic @xmath23 curves .",
    "the lower curve is for the crystallites with the field aligned along the crystallographic @xmath39-axis and the upper curve is for the crystallites with the field aligned along the basal plane .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures @xmath38 approaches a remarkably high value between 6 and 7 . over the past several months , detailed measurements on small single crystalline samples",
    "have confirmed not only the size of the low temperature anisotropy , but also the full temperature dependence of @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite the low temperature value of the anisotropy , @xmath38 = 6 - 7 , is in excellent agreement with the anisotropic @xmath23 that would be anticipated if only the two dimensional , cylindrical fermi surface is responsible for the low-@xmath30 , @xmath41 2 t , superconductivity .",
    "@xcite if this is the case , as recent experiments seem to confirm , @xcite then @xmath42 , assuming that the gap over the cylinder is essentially constant . using the anisotropic fermi velocities for the 2-d cylinder @xcite we find that this ratio to be @xmath3 @xmath43 40 which is in excellent agreement with the measured value of @xmath38 at low temperatures . a fuller and more detailed presentation of the temperature dependence of anisotropies in mgb@xmath0 will be presented by kogan _",
    "et al . _ , as well as others , later in this volume .",
    "the @xmath26 isotherms that were used to determine @xmath27 as well as @xmath31 also yielded information about the critical current density , @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ f8 ] presents @xmath45 for a variety of representative temperatures .",
    "the higher values of @xmath46 were inferred from magnetization data using the bean model @xcite and the lower values of @xmath44 were directly measured via @xmath47 measurements . @xcite for comparison @xmath45 data for nb@xmath48sn are also shown for @xmath30 = 4.2 k. @xcite    several points are worth noting .",
    "first of all , even though these @xmath44 values are lower than those for nb@xmath48sn at 4 - 5 k , the @xmath44 values are not all that small , especially when you consider that the sample was high purity mgb@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , at 20 k nb@xmath48sn is in the normal state ( i.e. @xmath44 = 0 ) whereas the @xmath44 values for mgb@xmath0 are still sizable for low to intermediate fields .",
    "secondly , @xmath46 is an extrinsic property that can be increased dramatically by judicious choices of impurities and defects to act as pinning sites . over the past year",
    "@xmath44 values in wire segments have increased by approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "recent work by finnemore _",
    "( see later in this volume ) on ti and c doped wires has shown that the low temperature , low field value of @xmath44 can be increased to mid- 10@xmath49 a/@xmath50 .",
    "comparable values have been found for thin film samples .",
    "hopefully further increases in @xmath44 , not only for low fields , but also for higher fields will continue over the next few years .",
    "mgb@xmath0 is a poster child for two very different and important observations about solid state physics .",
    "first , the field of solid state physics has come a fantastically long way given that the basic physical properties of mgb@xmath0 , as well as our theoretical understanding of them , were well delineated within less than a year of its rediscovery .",
    "this is a remarkable fact and should not be given short shrift .",
    "secondly , superconductivity in this simple binary compound lay undiscovered until the new millennium , despite extensive searches over the past 80 years , and although superconductivity in this material is now well understood , it was not predicted _ a priori_. it is vital to experimentally search for ( i ) new materials and ( ii ) new properties / groundstates in old ones .",
    "the continued search for new materials and new properties in binary , ternary , quaternary , and even more complex compounds is one of the most important engines driving this field of science .",
