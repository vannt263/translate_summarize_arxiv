    "expressed differently : @xmath2 is a totally geodesic submanifold ( in fact hypersurface ) of the optical manifold .",
    "photon surfaces have attracted attention recently , in particular in the last two years there have been several results establishing the uniqueness of spacetimes admitting a photon surface under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "these works typically assume that the spacetime is complete , asymptotically flat and with the exception of @xcite assume that the lapse , @xmath7 , is constant on the surface . in this paper",
    "we give some counter - examples to demonstrate that the conclusions of these theorems can be violated if one allows certain of the assumptions to be dropped .",
    "in particular , we shall show that there exist physically interesting metrics satisfying einstein s equations ( with or without matter ) with non - spherically symmetric photon spheres such that the lapse is not constant on the photon sphere .",
    "moreover these metrics are not of cohomogeneity one .",
    "the metrics contain relatively mild ( conical ) singularities , and are not asymptotically flat in the usual sense ( although in the @xmath13 case they contain regions in which the curvature approaches zero ) .",
    "these spacetimes we consider are all related to the c - metrics , first found by levi - civita @xcite , which are now understood to represent uniformly accelerated black holes .",
    "anti - photon surfaces are much less well known .",
    "they correspond in the static setting to totally geodesic submanifolds of the optical metric for which , however , the photon orbits lying in the surface are stable ( as opposed to the unstable case characterising the photon surfaces ) . in the spherically symmetric case , in the absence of naked singularities , it seems that these can not occur if the energy - momentum tensor satisfies reasonable energy conditions @xcite .",
    "however , in a class of cylindrically symmetric spacetimes of melvin type @xcite we present anti - photon cylinders .",
    "while the existence of a photon surface surrounding a spherically symmetric black hole is not surprising , the fact that it persists when the black hole undergoes a uniform acceleration and ceases to be spherically symmetric is not at all obvious .",

    "the examples given above may be compared with various uses in the literature of the term `` photon sphere '' .",
    "firstly the word `` sphere '' seems inappropriate since it could be construed to mean a 2-surface which has the intrinsic geometry of a round or canonical sphere .",
    "a less misleading term is `` photon surface '' . in the case of a static metric",
    ", the most natural definition would be a totally geodesic submanifold of the optical manifold .",
    "as such , it need not be a level set of the lapse function @xmath7 . indeed in the case of the vacuum c - metric n = , which depends upon _ both _ @xmath27 and @xmath75 , while the photon surface is at a fixed value of @xmath75 . for the melvin universe ,",
    "the lapse is constant on the anti - photon surface .",
    "the definition given above is much less restrictive than that used in several recent uniqueness results @xcite where it is insisted that a photon sphere be a level set of @xmath96 and any electrostatic potentials .",
    "a recent attempt has been made to remove that restriction @xcite and we suggest therefore , at least in the static situation , that the term photon surface be limited to that used in the present paper .",
    "another distinction to be borne in mind is that from what teo @xcite calls `` spherical photon orbits around a kerr black hole '' .",
    "he finds a family of orbits which lie in a surface of constant @xmath97 in a certain coordinate system but the surface is not geometrically a sphere and moreover not every photon orbit whose initial tangent lies in the sphere remains in the sphere .",
