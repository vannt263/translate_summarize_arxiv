    "low - dimensional magnetic systems are currently a subject of intensive experimental and theoretical work . cluster methods , which approximate the physics of the infinite system by solving the problem for a corresponding finite cluster , are the most frequently used theoretical approaches , as they account short - range correlations on the scale of the cluster size . numerical standard methods in the field , such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite , and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , are able to give essentially exact results on limited size systems and form a versatile methodological triad in simulations of model hamiltonians .",
    "even though these techniques have had spectacular successes in calculating ground state energies and many other properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum spin systems @xcite there is a problem with an utilizing of symmetries and good quantum numbers of the hamiltonian , which may be exploited to thin out hilbert space by decomposing it into a sum of sectors .",
    "common symmetries and conservation laws encountered in spin systems are : ( i ) ising or xy symmetry ( magnetization conservation @xmath2=const ) ; ( ii ) point group symmetry ( parity , angular momentum conserved ) ; ( iii ) full @xmath1 symmetry ( @xmath3 conserved ) . among these symmetries only the first is usually exploited in numerical calculations .",
    "the full @xmath1 spin symmetry is rather hard to implement , since it requires efforts similar to the diagonalization of the actual hamiltonian to construct the eigenstates of @xmath4 .",
    "an implementation of nonabelian @xmath1 spin symmetry based on clebsch - gordan transformations and elimination of quantum numbers via the wigner - eckart theorem was performed for the interaction round a face ( irf ) models in the framework of the irf - dmrg method @xcite .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied to the spin-@xmath5 heisenberg chain and , later , to the spin 1 and 2 heisenberg chains @xcite .",
    "the performant dmrg method conserving a total spin quantum number has been suggested by mcculloch and gulasci @xcite .",
    "an application of @xmath1 symmetries for the matrix product method ( mpm ) closely related to the dmrg @xcite  gives a rotationally invariant formulation valid for spin chains and ladders @xcite .",
    "as for the lattice point symmetry , despite its importance in characteristing energy states of a spin system , there appears to have been little previous work on the subject .",
    "even though an implementing this symmetry does not lead to a drastic reduction of a dimension of the hilbert space sector to be diagonalized we can resolve properties as a function of additional quantum numbers ( irreducible representations of the point group )",
    ". this circumstance might be crucial for efficient truncation of hilbert space in algorithms based on real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) procedure .",
    "this generates a motivation for the present paper , namely , we present a finite cluster solver based on rsrg scheme which allows to exploit both the continuous nonabelian @xmath6 symmetry and discrete symmetry of the lattice point group in application to isotropic two - dimensional _ spin-_@xmath0 systems . as an example illustrating features of our method we consider the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( afh ) on a square lattice",
    "this choice is motivated by two reasons .",
    "first , the physical properties of the @xmath7 afh model on the infinite square lattice at @xmath8 have been much studied and calculated by various methods by many physicists @xcite .",
    "the focus has generally been on the ground state energy and staggered magnetization although some other quantities have also been computed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) .",
    "second , the underlying idea of our approach was first developed by lin and campbell in the study of this model system @xcite . before moving on to the details ,",
    "we discuss important aspects of finite - lattice simulations using the ed method regarding the cluster geometry .",
    "the method of exact diagonalization has been used on the best bipartite finite square lattices with up to @xmath9 vertices @xcite . on each of a set of finite lattices , the hamiltonian of",
    "the quantum spin model is diagonalized exactly to find the ground - state energy and the ground state eigenvector .",
    "the ground state properties can then be calculated exactly .",
    "the exact ground - state data for each physical property of the model on all finite lattices are extrapolated against an appropriate inverse power of @xmath10 to obtain an estimate of the property on the infinite lattice at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "haan et al .",
    "@xcite showed that certain parallelogram clusters could produce good results in finite - size exact diagonalization calculations .",
    "later , betts et al . developed a grading scheme of parallelogram tiles of the square lattice that could generate the best finite clusters @xcite . from a symmetry point of view",
    ", this approach has an apparent flaw : the point symmetry of a parallelogram cluster does not match that of the infinte square lattice .    in this respect , a renormalization - group ( rg ) approach suggested by lin and campbell combining exact diagonalization results with a rg type analysis seems us to be more promising .",
    "the basics idea of their calculations for @xmath11 afh on an @xmath12 cluster ( @xmath13 is an odd integer ) is to divide this cluster into two parts : an inner @xmath14 cluster and the perimeter (  outer ring  ) .",
    "the afh model is firstly solved for the inner cluster and its ground state is mapped onto a single effective spin ( all the excited states are thrown away ) .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to an effective @xmath15 afh model in which spins on the outer ring experience antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interactions and interact individually with the effective central spin .",
    "the latter plays the role of a staggered external magnetic field .",
    "the procedure is repeated for increasing values of @xmath13 and demonstrates convincingly that the staggered magnetic long - range order exists at zero temperature .",
    "we note especially that the lattice point symmetry holds for all the clusters and their ground state always has spin @xmath7 ( not a singlet ) according to the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite .",
    "we offer to change real - space rg strategy of the approach making it closer to dmrg  methodology .",
    "our treatment begins by dividing a cluster into a central spin and its environment .",
    "in the course of real - space rg iterations the environment increases ( technical details are discussed in the text ) and we determine how coupling between the central spin and the environment varies .",
    "note especially that we address to the exact diagonalization procedure twice at each rg step .",
    "the first use gives access to states of the environment and the second one does to those of the whole cluster that provides its spectrum and observables of interest . within our rg framework ,",
    "local results such as the energy per bond @xmath16 and the staggered magnetic moment @xmath17 are measured on the central site .",
    "we have carried out the renormalization procedure through systems of size @xmath18 , and , in contrast to approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , we keep _ not only _ the ground state . for small clusters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 )",
    "we use all of the excited states of the environment found by exact diagonalization , whereas for the cluster of size @xmath22 we apply a symmetry based truncation procedure , retaining only the states with largest weight in the environment density matrix .",
    "for this cluster we have compared the exact diagonalization result for @xmath16 and @xmath17 with those obtained via our renormalization group , and we regard the resulting better than @xmath23 @xmath24  agreement as support for the reliability of our calculations .",
    "we note that several other methods to improve the rsrg calculations have been previously formulated to study low - energy properties of spin lattice models . among the most important and successful ones",
    ", one may cite the real space renormalization group with effective interactions ( rsrg - ei ) @xcite , and the dressed cluster method ( dcm ) @xcite .",
    "the first method is an improvement of the rsrg method originally proposed by wilson . by considering the blocks of lattice it extracts effective interactions between the blocks through the exact diagonalization of dimers of blocks .",
    "the knowledge of the exact spectrum of the dimers enable one to define interblock effective interactions via an effective hamiltonian .",
    "this procedure is iteratevely repeated to blocks of blocks providing at very low cost reasonable estimate of the energy per bond for 1d and 2d spin lattices .",
    "the second method ( dcm ) uses a single reference wave function as do the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite .",
    "this wave function is used as a  bath in which a finite cluster is embedded and treated exactly .",
    "the effect of excitations occuring on the bonds around the cluster is taken into account through a dressing of the cluster configuration interaction ( ci ) matrix .",
    "this approach gives results for the cohesive energy of the same accuracy as the best qmc ones .",
    "the dcm can be seen as a convenient approximation of the ccm .",
    "however , the problem is formulated as a diagonalization of a dressed ci matrix instead of the resolution of a nonlinear system of equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the general formalism for two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 systems is introduced in the following section . in sec .",
    "iii  we apply the method to the afh model on a square lattice .",
    "finally , our conclusions and an outlook are presented in sec .",
    "in the first step one must identify the cluster . as detailed above",
    ", care should be taken to ensure that the cluster has the same point - group symmetry as the lattice .",
    "since calculation of antiferromagnetism requires bipartite clusters , we select a cluster with a bipartite environment of the central site ( the case of this violation will be illustrated in the example of the cluster @xmath21 ) .",
    "the cluster hamiltonian    @xmath26    is composed of the term @xmath27 describing interactions of the central spin @xmath28 with the nearest neighbors at distances @xmath29 and rest terms denoted as the hamiltonian of the  environment  @xmath30 . since , by construction , the cluster retains a lattice point symmetry , its states @xmath31 with the energies @xmath32 are labeled by the cluster total spin @xmath0 with the third component @xmath33 and by the irreducible representation @xmath34 of the cluster point group .",
    "different states with the same values @xmath35 and @xmath34 are distinguished by the index @xmath36 .",
    "in addition we need to consider the operator @xmath37 as a double irreducible tensor which transforms according to identity representation @xmath38 .",
    "the same arguments enable us to use the irreducible form of the central spin operator @xmath39",
    ". the part @xmath40 may be written as the inner product @xmath41 \\left ( s_0\\right ) _ { q1}^{1a_1}o_{-q1}^{1a_1}\\equiv \\left [ \\left ( s_0\\right ) ^{1a_1}\\times o^{1a_1}\\right ] _ { 01}^{0a_1},\\ ] ] where @xmath42 = 1 $ ] is the clebsch - gordan coefficient of the cluster point group @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that we have found the eigenvalues @xmath43 and the eigenstates of the environment hamiltonian @xmath30 in the form @xmath44 .",
    "the basis functions of the full cluster are obtained by the addition rule of spin angular momentum    @xmath45 \\left| i_us_um_u\\gamma _ u\\mu _",

    "@xcite , and @xmath47 is the wave function of the central spin .",
    "since the state @xmath48 is invariant under all transformations of the point symmetry group , the cluster basis functions transform like that of the environment according to the same irreducible representations .",
    "the calculation of matrix elements for the hamiltonian ( [ hful ] ) with the help of the wigner - ekart s theorem yields ( see appendix a ) @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a @xmath53-symbol . the first reduced matrix element is @xmath54 and the latter may be obtained if the environment eigenstates are known ( see sec.iii ) .",
    "the energy per bond is then calculated as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the number of nearest - neighbors of the central spin .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath57 and the energy levels @xmath32 are determined by direct diagonalization of the cluster hamiltonian @xmath58 [ eq.([hfulme ] ) ] .",
    "the values @xmath59 should be regarded as an approximation of the energy spectrum in the thermodynamical limit , whereas the energy @xmath60 divided per bond number is much less appropriate for this .",
    "it is important to note that from eq.([hfulme ] ) it follows that to build the cluster target state @xmath61 we need only to know the states @xmath62 of the environment with the quantum numbers @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the most important quantity typically measured in numerical simulations is the ground - state staggered magnetization @xmath65 .",
    "the quantum mechanical observable for @xmath56-projection of the central spin is given as follows    @xmath66    where the identity ( [ three3j ] ) is used .",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath65 is determined as @xmath67 where factor 3 arises from rotational symmetry in spin space . at long distances @xmath68",
    "that yields our estimate of the full root - mean - square staggered magnetization per spin @xmath69 .    according to eq.([vint ] ) , spin - correlation function in the states of @xmath70-symmetry , the ground state symmetry as shown below , is determined as @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the lattice coordination number . in this calculation",
    "it is convenient to introduce the double irreducible tensor @xmath74 summing spins at distance @xmath75 , which transforms according to identity representation @xmath38 .",
    "one can see that @xmath76      as mentioned above , the lattice point - group symmetry should be conserved with increasing cluster size .",
    "the requirement is put into a practical computational scheme by the following algorithm : ( i ) at step @xmath10 we have the eigenvalues @xmath77 and eigenvectors @xmath78 of the environment .",
    "make a regular symmetry conserving expansion in the cluster size by adding sites from the next coordination shell .",
    "( ii ) using a scheme of coupling of angular momenta we build the set @xmath79 of states with total spin @xmath80 and third component @xmath81 for the part that is being attached to the environment .",
    "the index @xmath82 labels other possible quantum numbers .",

    "note that following the scheme we will in some cases form intermediate clusters , unsuitable for calculations of local results , with a non - bipartite environment .",
    "the spin - half antiferromagnet on a square lattice represents an optimal playground to study the strength and limitations of the method . to implement the algorithm",
