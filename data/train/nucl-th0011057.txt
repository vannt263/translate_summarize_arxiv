    "we now turn to another basic source for csb of the nuclear force , namely , nucleon mass splitting .",
    "the most trivial consequence of nucleon mass splitting is a difference in the kinetic energies : for the heavier neutrons , the kinetic energy is smaller than for protons .",
    "this raises the magnitude of the @xmath17 scattering length by 0.25 fm as compared to @xmath16 .",
    "besides this , nucleon mass splitting has an impact on all meson - exchange diagrams that contribute to the nuclear force .",
    "for example , there are the one - boson exchange ( obe ) diagrams , fig .",
    "[ fig_mn1 ] , which are affected by only a negligible amount .",
    "however , a sophisticated and realistic meson model for the nuclear force  @xcite goes beyond single meson exchange and includes irreducible diagrams of two - boson exchange which generate substantial csb from nucleon mass splitting .",
    "the major part of the csb effect comes from diagrams of @xmath34 exchange with @xmath35 intermediate states , fig .",
    "[ fig_mn2 ] .",
    "in fact , these diagrams can fully explain the empirical csb splitting of the singlet scattering length  @xcite .",
    "finally , for reasons of completeness , we mention that irreducible diagrams of @xmath26 and @xmath36 exchange between two nucleons create a charge - dependent nuclear force .",
    "recently , these contributions have been calculated to leading order in chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that to this order the @xmath37 force is charge - symmetric ( but does break charge independence ) .",
    "the bottom line then is that we have two csb mechanisms in hand , each powerful enough to fully explain the charge asymmetry seen in the singlet scattering length .",
    "this state of affairs challenges the question : _ which of the two mechanisms is nature really using ? _ to answer the question , the @xmath3 state at zero energy is obviously of no use since this can be described equally well by both mechanisms .",
    "thus , the answer , if any , can only come from energies @xmath38 and/or states with @xmath39 .",
    "it is quite possible that the predictions by the two mechanisms are very different in states other than @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath34 exchange contribution to the nuclear force ( where the csb effect due to nucleon mass splitting mainly comes from ) is chiefly a central force of intermediate range , while vector meson exchange ( involved in @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing ) creates a large spin - orbit component and a short - ranged central force .",
    "this may create large differences in triplet @xmath8 waves where the signature of spin - orbit forces is most pronounced .",
    "if large differences between the models occur for @xmath39 , then each mechanism may have a characteristic signature on observables that are sensitive to csb from @xmath8 and higher partial waves . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that about 50% of the csb contribution to the nolen - schiffer ( ns ) anomaly  @xcite comes from the @xmath39 two - nucleon states .",
    "thus , there is the possibility that the differences between competing csb models may show up as differences in the predictions for the ns anomaly .",
    "other observables may be considered , too .",

    "the total csb difference of the singlet scattering length caused by nucleon mass splitting amounts to 1.508  fm  @xcite which agrees well with the empirical value @xmath122 fm .",

    "also the calculation of the correction terms would be based on single - particle wavefunctions which are localized too much .",
    "( ii ) bhf calculations are appropriate for short - range correlations . however , long - range correlations involving the admixture of configurations with low excitation energies in the uncorrelated shell - model basis require a more careful treatment .",
    "( iii ) the bhf single - particle energies do not account for any distribution of the single - particle strength consistent with realistic spectral functions .    for the reasons listed , we take the following approach .",
    "we use single - particle wave functions from hartree - fock calculations with effective nuclear forces , which yield a good fit to the empirical charge distribution .",
    "these wave functions are used to determine the leading coulomb contribution and corrections like the effects of finite proton size , the electromagnetic spin - orbit interaction , the kinetic energy correction due to the mass difference between proton and neutron , and the effects of vacuum polarization .",
    "actually , for these contributions we use the results by sato@xcite . the first column of our table  [ tab_ns ] is taken from table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite which includes all the effects just mentioned .",
    "the correlation effects are taken into account in a two - step procedure .",
    "we assume a model space defined in terms of shell - model configurations including oscillator single - particle states up to the 1p0f shell .",
    "we use the oscillator parameter @xmath148 fm which is appropriate for @xmath149 .",
    "the effects of short - range correlations are calculated by employing an effective interaction , i.e.  a @xmath150-matrix suitable for the model space .",
    "this @xmath150-matrix is determined as the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation @xmath151 where @xmath152 is identified with the kinetic energy operator , while @xmath153 stands for the bare two - body interaction including the coulomb interaction and accounting for csb in the strong interaction . the pauli operator @xmath154 in this bethe - goldstone eq .",
    "( [ gmat ] ) is defined in terms of two - particle harmonic oscillator states @xmath155 by @xmath156 as a first approximation we use the resulting @xmath150-matrix elements and evaluate single - particle energies in the bhf approximation @xmath157 .",
    "this approximation , which will be denoted as bhf in the discussion below , accounts for short - range correlations , which are described in terms of configurations outside our model space . in a next step",
    "we add to this bhf definition of the nucleon self - energy the irreducible terms of second order in @xmath150 which account for intermediate two - particle one - hole and one - particle two - hole configurations within the model - space @xmath158 applying the techniques described in @xcite , we can solve the dyson equation for the single - particle greens function @xmath159 @xmath160 with @xmath161 the bhf approximation for the single - particle greens function , and determine its lehmann representation @xmath162 this yields directly the energies of the states with @xmath163 nucleons that we are interested in .",
    "our results for the coulomb displacement energies are listed in table  [ tab_ns ] for various one - hole and one - particle states relative to @xmath147o .",
    "the first column of this table , @xmath164 , contains the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the leading coulomb contributions , the corrections due to the finite proton size , the electromagnetic spin - orbit interaction , the kinetic energy correction due to nucleon mass splitting , and the effects of vacuum polarization .",
    "as discussed above , we think that it is more realistic to evaluate these contributions for single - particle wave functions which are derived from hartree - fock calculations with phenomenological forces rather than using the wavefunctions derived from a microscopic bhf calculation .",
    "the second and third columns of table  [ tab_ns ] list the corrections to the coulomb displacement energies which originate from the treatment of short - range ( @xmath165 ) and long - range correlations ( @xmath166 ) discussed above .",
    "the correction @xmath165 has been derived from the differences of bhf single - particle energies for protons and neutrons subtracting the coulomb displacement energy evaluated in the mean - field approximation @xmath167 in this case the bhf calculations have been performed with the @xmath168 versions of the different interactions .",
    "the correction terms @xmath166 have been evaluated in a similar way from the quasiparticle energies determined in the greens function approach , subtracting the bhf effects already contained in @xmath165 .",
    "the correction terms @xmath165 and @xmath166 include the effects represented by irreducible diagrams of second and higher order in the interaction , in which at least one of the interaction lines represents the coulomb interaction .",
    "in addition they contain the effects of folded diagrams discussed by tam et al.@xcite .",
    "we find that the correlation effects are rather weak .",
    "the short- and long - range contributions tend to cancel each other .",
    "this is true in particular for the one - hole states @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the effects of short - range correlations dominate in the case of the particle states , @xmath171 and @xmath172 , leading to a total correlation effect in the order of 100 kev in the coulomb displacement energies .",
    "this effect is slightly larger for the argonne potential than for the bonn potentials because of the stronger correlations in the case of argonne .",
    "the contributions to the coulomb displacement energies caused by csb of the @xmath0 interactions , @xmath173 , are listed in the fourth column of table  [ tab_ns ] .",
    "we have conducted separate calculations for each of the three models for csb introduced in sec .",
    "we note that , also in the calculations of the coulomb displacement energies , it is important to include csb beyond the @xmath3 state in the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "similarly to what we found for the nuclear matter @xmath143 ( cf .  sec .",
    "iii.b.1 and lower part of table  [ tab_app ] ) , csb in @xmath8 and higher partial waves contributes about 50% of the total @xmath173 .",
    "this was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we achieve satisfactory or even good agreement in some cases , like @xmath174 and @xmath172 , but there are discrepancies in others . for @xmath175 and @xmath171",
    "the remaining discrepancies are larger than the @xmath173 contribution .",
    "the general trend in the results is that the @xmath1-@xmath2 model generates about 10 - 20% more @xmath173 than the @xmath126-splitting mechanism , and argonne @xmath40 is , in general , in - between the two .",
    "even though the @xmath1-@xmath2 trend is a favourable one , it is not sufficiently pronounced such that one could give a preference to this model . in the critical cases , like @xmath175 and @xmath171 , the discrepancies between all model predictions , on the one hand , and experiment , on the other , are much larger than the differences within the model predictions .",
    "concerning the remaining discrepancy , a comment is in place .",
    "note that the nuclear structure part of our calculations may carry some uncertainty .",
    "this is true in particular for the evaluation of the leading coulomb contribution , which is sensitive to the hartree - fock wave functions which are used .",
    "to obtain an idea of how large such uncertainties may be , we compare the results for coulomb displacement energies using the skyrme ii force and _ no csb _ by sato  @xcite with the more recent ones by suzuki _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . for the single - hole state @xmath175 ,",
    "suzuki s result is larger by 167 kev as compared to sato ; and for the single - particle state @xmath171 , the two calculations differ by 138 kev",
    ". uncertainties of this size can well explain the remaining discrepancies in our results .",
    "we have tested three different models for the charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the models are based upon @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , nucleon mass ( @xmath126 ) splitting , and phenomenology ( argonne @xmath40 ) .",
    "all models reproduce the empirical value for the csb of the @xmath3 scattering length ( @xmath4 ) accurately .",
    "we reveal that there are considerable differences in the predictions by these models for csb in @xmath5 waves .",
    "we have investigated the impact of these differences on some observable quantities of @xmath6 nuclear systems that are sensitive to csb of the nuclear force .",
    "we find that the @xmath7h-@xmath7he binding energy difference is essentially ruled by @xmath4 and that @xmath8 and higher partial waves contribute only about 6% .",
    "therefore , this quantity is unsuitable to discriminate between different models for csb of the nuclear force .",
    "a test calculation conducted for nuclear matter shows that in heavier nuclear systems the difference between proton and neutron single - particle energies receives about 50% from partial waves other than @xmath3 .",
    "motivated by this result , we have calculated the coulomb displacement energies around the closed shell nucleus @xmath147o .",
    "we find that the contribution to these energy differences from csb of the @xmath0 interaction ( which is in the order of 100 kev ) differs by 10 - 20% among the three models for csb , which is appreciable .",
    "unfortunately , the nuclear structure part of these calculations , in particular the evaluation of the leading coulomb contributions , carry an uncertainty in the order of 100 kev such that the subtle differences between the competing csb models get swamped .",
    "therefore we must conclude that , based upon the calculations conducted in this study , we are unable to give preference to any of the three csb models",
    ".    what we need are observables for which the nuclear structure part is fully under control .",
    "this suggests to look into nuclear few - body reactions for which exact calculations can be performed  @xcite .",
    "an example could be the analyzing power , @xmath176 , in nucleon - deuteron scattering that is known to depend sensitively on the @xmath5 waves of the @xmath0 potential .",
    "accurate data on @xmath177 and @xmath178 @xmath176 exist and these data exhibit a clear signature of csb .",
    "unfortunately , these data can not be explained without resource to three - body forces which may obscure the csb aspect of the problem . in any case , we like to encourage the nuclear few - body community  @xcite to identify spin observables in few - body reactions that show sensitivity to csb of the @xmath0 interaction , particularly , the one that comes from @xmath5 waves . investigations of this kind may ultimately allow to discriminate between competing models for csb of the nuclear force .      c. r. howell _ et al .",
