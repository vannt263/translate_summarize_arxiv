    "there is much current interest in the possibility of cloaking or hiding objects from scrutiny by electromagnetic waves .",
    "at least three techniques have been proposed to achieve this : one avoids detection by surrounding the target body with a metamaterial shell which guides light around the central cavity @xcite , the second again relies on a metamaterial @xcite , which this time cloaks by resonance an external region , while the third uses a structured metamaterial which provides cloaking by in effect folding space back upon itself @xcite .",
    "the technical challenges of making such systems in practice are enormous , but it should be realized that these and other proposals for cloaking offer complementary characteristics , which implies that work on a range of them is valuable .",
    ".[tab1]comparison of three cloaking methods .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     we present a number of salient characteristics of the three methods in table  1 . cloaking by refraction requires a structured metamaterial shell to divert light around a cavity in which the object to be hidden is placed ( internal cloaking ) .",
    "it is designed using a full solution of maxwell equations in two or three dimensions , and there has been an experimental demonstration of this mechanism in the former case @xcite .",
    "the second and third methods offer the complementary feature of concealing a body in a region close to , but outside , the cloaking system ( external cloaking ) . in the case of cloaking by reaction ,",
    "the object is concealed by virtue of a plasmonic resonance , which requires the material in the cylindrical cloaking shell to have a dielectric constant close to the negative of the dielectric constants in the core and matrix regions surrounding it .",
    "it has been studied to this point mainly in two dimensions .",
    "the third method is the most recent , and has features in common with each of the other two .",
    "it achieves cloaking by using a spatially varying dielectric constant and magnetic permeability , designed using the same principles of transformation optics at a basis of refractive cloaking .",
    "the goal here , however , is to in effect fold space back upon itself , and , loosely speaking , to hide the object within the enfolding .",
    "it is our purpose here to study one problematic aspect of cloaking by reaction , which is implicit in two previous papers @xcite , but which has not been studied systematically .",
    "the problem does not arise for cloaking by refraction or unfolding , by virtue of their different mechanism of operation , which ensures that both the cloaking system and the cloaked object are hidden to an equal degree from electromagnetic probes . as we shall see",
    ", this is not necessarily for cloaking by reaction , where it is quite possible for a larger cloaking system to successfully cloak a small object , but to be itself quite visible .",
    "using a visual analogy from the animal kingdom , we refer to this as `` ostrich effect '' : _ the large object hides the small object , but the large object does not hide itself_. the possibility of the ostrich effect , was signaled in a paper by milton , brian and willis @xcite : `` besides invisibility there is what we call cloaking where the surrounding material does not have to be carefully adapted to suit the object to be made invisible",
    ". the cloaking device may be invisible or visible , although obviously the former is more interesting . ''",
    "we take the viewpoint here that for many purposes , the ostrich effect will be undesirable , and so we provide examples of the effect , explore its underlying physics , and quantify the circumstances under which it is greatly reduced . in sec .",
    "ii we present two figures taken from simulations showing the quenching of the dipole moment of a probe cylinder in the vicinity of a cylindrical shell with realistic values of the complex dielectric constant .",
    "these figures illustrate clearly the ostrich effect . in the next section we consider a coated cylinder interacting with an incident plane wave and",
    "solve this scattering problem in closed form .",
    "we also take the long wavelengths limit of the formulation , in order to exhibit the transition from dynamics to qualitative . in sec .",
    "iv we use the scattering cross section of the coated cylinder to show the counterintuitive result that a small imaginary part of @xmath0 actually benefits cloaking at finite wavelengths , since it makes dipole rather than monopole terms dominant in the scattering cross section .",
    "this is in keeping with the results of hao - yuan she @xcite but not with those reported by min yan @xcite .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional physical system comprising a coated cylinder centred about the origin of coordinates and a probe ( solid ) cylinder on the y - axis .",
    "both cylinders are perpendicular to the @xmath1-plane .",
    "the shell and core radii of the coated cylinder are , respectively , @xmath2 nm , @xmath3 nm , while the radius of the probe cylinder is @xmath4 nm . also , the core and shell relative permittivities are @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the relative permittivity of the probe cylinder is @xmath7 and the relative permittivity of the matrix is @xmath8 .",
    "all the components are non - magnetic so that the relative permeabilities are @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the permeability of the probe cylinder .",
    "left : contour plot of @xmath11 as a function of position for a system consisting of a coated cylinder ( @xmath2 nm , @xmath3 nm , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath12 ) interacting with a probe cylinder ( @xmath4 nm , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and irradiated by a @xmath15 polarized plane wave with wavelength @xmath16 nm coming from above . the probe cylinder is within the cloaking region bounded by the dashed circle , at a distance of 85 nm from the origin .",
    "right : magnitude of the dipole moment of the probe cylinder as a function of its position indicated by the red line .",
    "the magnetic field varies in the range @xmath17 , whereas the incident plane wave is normalized to @xmath18 , width=576 ]     as for fig .",
    "[ fig01x ] with the probe cylinder outside the cloaking region .",
    "now , the probe is at a distance of 200 nm from the origin , and @xmath19.,width=576 ]    this physical system is subjected to an incident plane wave having @xmath20 nm and with the wave vector in the @xmath1-plane ( in - plane incidence ) and polarized with the magnetic field parallel to the cylinder axes ( @xmath15 polarization ) .",
    "the probe cylinder is polarisable , and has a dipole moment proportional to the total electric field at its position .",
    "when the probe cylinder moves along the @xmath21-axis and enters the cloaking region , marked by the dashed circle in figures [ fig01x ] and [ fig02x ] , one can see the effect of cloaking , in the sense that the dipole moment of the probe cylinder tends to zero within the cloaking circle of radius @xmath22 @xcite ( see figure [ fig01x ] , right panel ) .",
    "consequently , the probe cylinder is successfully cloaked within @xmath23 but not of course outside it , compare the left panels of figures [ fig01x ] and [ fig02x ] .",
    "nevertheless , the cloaking system is not invisible , since the coated cylinder distorts the incident plane wave .",
    "note that figures [ fig01x ] and [ fig02x ] are frames in the animation available with this paper , which illustrates the quenching of the dipole moment of the probe cylinder within the cloaking circle , and its re - emergence outside it .",
    "the relative permittivity value chosen for the shell in figures [ fig01x ] and [ fig02x ] is comparable to that of silicon carbide near @xmath24 m @xcite , and has an imaginary part somewhat lower than that of silver at the wavelength in the ultraviolet where the real part of its permittivity passes through -1 .",
    "while we refer to distances in nanometers , in practice the relevant parameter is the wavelength of the incident radiation divided by a characteristic length , say the outer radius @xmath25 of the coated cylinder .",
    "hence , the results shown in figures [ fig01x ] and [ fig02x ] and subsequent figures can be easily applied to systems rescaled to correspond to materials other than those mentioned .",
    "note that in the previous figures and simulations we have presented @xcite to illustrate resonant cloaking , the value of the imaginary part of @xmath0 was chosen to correspond to the mathematical analysis , rather than to practical materials .",
    "we have found that good quenching of the dipole moment of the probe particle can be achieved even with quite significant imaginary parts for @xmath0 , provided @xmath23 is sufficiently in excess of @xmath25 , so that the probe particle can move deep within the cloaking region .    despite the quite effective cloaking of the probe cylinder shown in the right panels of figures [ fig01x ] and [ fig02x ] ,",
    "the left panels illustrate strong distortion of the incident wave in the vicinity of the cloaking cylinder .",
    "such variations of magnetic field strength would compromise any attempts to hide the compound system of cloaking cylinder plus probe .",
    "we mention that in all numerical computations we have used the scattering - matrix method @xcite , which is based on the expansion of the fields in terms of fourier - bessel series around each cylinder . by using the scattering matrices of each cylinder and the translation properties of fourier - bessel functions",
    ", the method leads to the inversion of a linear set of equations .",
    "for a coated cylinder centered at the origin of coordinates , we represent the electric and magnetic fields @xmath26 and @xmath15 ( denoted here by @xmath27 ) , by series expansions in terms of cylindrical harmonics @xcite : @xmath28 \\mathrm{e}^{i \\ell \\theta } } \\\\ ~\\\\ { \\displaystyle \\left [ a_\\ell^{m } j_\\ell(k_\\mathrm{m } r ) +   b_\\ell^{m } h_\\ell^{(1)}(k_\\mathrm{m } r ) \\right ]   \\mathrm{e}^{i \\ell \\theta } } \\end{array } \\right\\ } \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\,(\\beta\\,z - \\omega\\,t ) } \\ , , \\label{fieldsx}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the bessel and hankel functions of the first kind .",
    "the three forms of the series expansions in ( [ fieldsx ] ) correspond to the domains @xmath31 ( inside the core of the coated cylinder ) , @xmath32 ( inside the shell of the coated cylinder ) and @xmath33 ( in the matrix ) , respectively . also , the superscripts @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 label the fields inside the cylinder core , cylinder shell , and in the matrix , respectively .",
    "thus , we have the wavenumbers @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the function @xmath27 has to satisfy the boundary conditions , i.e. , the continuity of the tangential components of the electric ( @xmath26 and @xmath40 ) and magnetic ( @xmath15 and @xmath41 ) fields across the core and shell surfaces .",
    "when the coated cylinder is subjected to an incident radiation which is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder , we have @xmath42 , and the problem can be reduced to solving two independent problems @xcite :    * @xmath26 polarization , when @xmath43 and the transverse parts of @xmath44 are generated by @xmath45 , and * @xmath15 polarization , when @xmath46 and @xmath47 gives the transverse components of @xmath48 .    in the present analysis",
    "we are interested in the relation between the coefficients in the matrix , which has the form @xmath49 the coefficients @xmath50 are determined by the sources of the field applied to the structure , and satisfy the field identity @xcite @xmath51 hence , we obtain the coefficients @xmath52 by expanding the source field in terms of cylindrical harmonics @xmath53 .    here",
    ", we also consider that the field applied to the physical structure is a plane wave field . in cylindrical coordinates , for @xmath15 polarization ( @xmath54 ) , a magnetic plane wave is described by the formula @xmath55}}\\ , , \\label{eqpwf01}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the angle of incidence with respect to the x - axis .",
    "we consider the case of in - plane incidence ( @xmath57 @xmath58 ) so that the exponential in ( [ eqpwf01 ] ) can be expanded in terms of bessel functions of the first kind @xmath59    consequently , for a coated cylinder subjected to a plane wave incoming field , perpendicular to the cylinder axis , we have the coefficients @xmath60 where @xmath61    in the case of @xmath26 polarization we obtain an equation identical to ( [ eqpwf03 ] ) for the coefficients of the electric field .",
    "we concentrate now on a coated cylinder , centered about the origin of coordinates , made from non - magnetic materials for which @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the dielectric constant of free space , and @xmath67 ( i = m , s , c ) represent the refractive indexes of the matrix , shell and core , respectively .",

    "we obtain the relation between @xmath50 and @xmath73 by changing @xmath74 in ( [ tebcd ] ) .    in the quasistatic limit ( @xmath75 ) ,",

    "then , we substitute these expressions in ( [ tebcd ] ) and write @xmath68 as a fraction . using the limit @xmath79",
    "we determine the coefficient of @xmath80 in the numerator and the coefficient of @xmath81 in the denominator .",
    "thus , the quasistatic limit of @xmath68 for @xmath82 is @xmath83 where @xmath84 for @xmath85 , we obtain a completely different form @xmath86 note that in all these calculations we made no assumption about the nature ( real or complex ) of permittivities or refractive indices .    to relate the long wavelength limit of the dynamic problem with the corresponding problem in electrostatics we apply the same method as in ref .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions for our problem correspond to an electrostatic problem in which the inverse of the dielectric constants ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) have to be considered .",
    "this will also change @xmath90 .",
    "now , the boundary conditions ( [ a21x ] ) for @xmath91 can be written in the form @xmath92 note that , here , we separated the product @xmath93 , which is dimensionless , so that @xmath94 and @xmath25 are considered as multiplied , respectively divided , by a length unit .    in electrostatics ,",
    "the corresponding relationship between the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 which controls the response of a coated cylinder to an external field , has the form @xcite @xmath97 now , by comparing ( [ tepr1 ] ) with ( [ statics ] ) we may infer the relation between static and dynamic multipole coefficients @xmath98 note that @xmath94 is dimensionless according to the note after ( [ tepr1 ] ) .    in electrostatics ,",
    "the partial resonances of a three  phase composite consisting of coated cylinders are defined by the equations @xcite @xmath99 when ( [ statics ] ) becomes @xmath100 or @xmath101 respectively . in the first case ,",
    "the field inside the coated cylinder is exactly the same as would be found within a solid cylinder of radius @xmath25 and dielectric constant @xmath102 , while the potential outside the coated cylinder , in the matrix , is precisely the same as that outside the solid cylinder @xcite .",
    "the second case corresponds to a solid cylinder of radius @xmath103 ( the geometrical image of the core boundary with respect to the shell outer boundary ) , and dielectric constant @xmath102 .",
    "now , the field external to the coated cylinder _ and beyond the radius _",
    "@xmath104 is the same as that external to the solid cylinder @xcite .    since it is the relationship between the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath73 which controls the response of a coated cylinder to an external field , equations ( [ statics ] ) and ( [ tepr1 ] ) show that this response is determined by @xmath105 in electrostatics as well as in the long wavelengths limit of electrodynamics .",
    "the limiting process is smooth and therefore , we expect a resonant behavior accompanied by cloaking effects , even for nonzero frequencies , when one of the conditions ( [ cspr ] ) or ( [ smpr ] ) is satisfied .",
    "now , in the long wavelength limit , the boundary conditions coefficients @xmath68 from ( [ a21x ] ) take the form @xmath106 for @xmath91 , and @xmath107    note that there are no terms of the form @xmath108 or @xmath109 in ( [ tmpr1 ] ) or ( [ tmpr2 ] ) to indicate a core  shell or shell  matrix partial resonance .",
    "again , the limiting process is smooth and , consequently , we do not expect a resonant behaviour of the coated cylinder , for any frequency , in the case of @xmath26 polarization .",
    "consequently , when the coated cylinder is irradiated with a field of a general polarization , that is a mixture of @xmath15 and @xmath26 polarizations , or in the case of conical incidence , the cloaking by resonance will never be perfect , or even may be completely ruined , due to the contribution of the @xmath26 polarized component .",
    "resonances similar to those in sec .",
    "[ tebcd ] can occur in the case of a coated cylinder made from magnetic metamaterials with permitivitty @xmath66 and permeabilities @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",

    ", we see that the dominant contribution to the cross section now comes from the dipole terms rather than the monopole terms . despite this difference ,",
    "the cross section is well approximated by its leading term when the wavelength reaches around 10 times the shell radius .",
    "note that in figure [ fig03x ] the cross section varies as approximately @xmath175 in the region of @xmath165 between 600 and 1000 ; this is far from the quasistatic behaviour of @xmath176 expected from equation ( [ sig08 ] ) , showing that for this ideal case the cross section is not well represented by quasistatics even at @xmath177 .",

    "these size limits in fact just require both the cloaking system and the system it is cloaking to be in the quasistatic regime .    we have also shown that this regime in fact sets in at shorter wavelengths for a resonant cloaking system with a small amount of loss , compared with the case of no loss .",
    "we have confined our studies to cloaking systems which have spatially uniform shells , but it may be the case that structured systems of the sort described by farhat @xcite may be designed which inhibit multipole responses in such a way as to ensure the onset of quasistatic behaviour at shorter wavelengths than indicated by figure [ fig07xx ]",
