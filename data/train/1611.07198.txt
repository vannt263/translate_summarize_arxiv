    "intercalation compounds on the basis of different layered host materials attract a lot of attention in the last decades .",
    "the most common examples , which appeared naturally during studies of the transport properties of graphite , are the graphite intercalation compounds ( gics )  @xcite , which can be formed in different ways via incorporation of atoms of metals or non - metals or big molecules between single graphite layers .",
    "further studies lead to the discovery of intercalation compounds on the basis of layers of coo@xmath0 ( li@xmath1coo@xmath0 , na@xmath1coo@xmath0 , etc . )",
    "@xcite , transition metal dichalcogenides ( cu@xmath1tise@xmath0 , li@xmath1mos@xmath0 , etc . )  @xcite and many others .",
    "all these studies demonstrate that chemical and physical properties of the intercalant hosts might be modified via controllable tailoring their electronic band structure , sometimes leading to the observation of new phenomena , which were previously not observed for the parent material , like superconductivity in alkali - metal gics  @xcite or cu@xmath1tise@xmath0  @xcite .    in case of intercalation compounds on the basis of graphite or transition metal dichalcogenides , inserting intercalant layers leads to the decoupling of 2d layers of the host material from each other allowing to perform studies of the electronic structure of the single layers , which is modified by the presence of intercalant .",
    "it is interesting that despite the 3d crystallographic structure of these materials and change of the periodicity in the system upon intercalation , the valence band structure of the resulting materials has a symmetry of the host material  @xcite .",
    "this effect was nicely demonstrated in the angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments on la - gic compound  @xcite , where band structures of a 2d host graphene layers and the inserted la layer , which have different symmetries , give the photoemission signals in the brillouine zone of the respective symmetry .",
    "it was shown that if the symmetry of the sub - systems is different and the interaction between atoms in the sub - unit is stronger than between units of the crystal , then the folded bands are not observed in the photoemission experiment .",
    "similar consideration is also valid for the local spectroscopic experiments , such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) or transport measurements , where effect of additional periodicity can change the transport coefficients dramatically .",
    "graphene ( gr ) , as a pure 2d material , is a subject of the intensive studies after its extraordinary transport properties , caused by the linear dispersion of the electronic states in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath2 ) , were discovered  @xcite . besides the perspectives for graphene to be used in different technological applications , e.g. in gas sensors  @xcite , in touch screens  @xcite , or as a protective anticorrosion layer  @xcite , it is a perfect material to study different physical phenomena in 2d materials that in many cases leads to the observation of the new fascinating effects .",
    "for example , if exfoliated graphene flake is placed on the h - bn substrate , then the small missalignment of two sublattices leads to the formation of the moir lattices in this system that influences the electronic spectrum of graphene and the so - called hofstadter butterfly spectrum of electrons , which movement is influenced by simultaneously acting periodic potential and the external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "further example is the graphene / metal system  @xcite , where graphene is usually synthesised via chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) technique . here",
    "the interaction between graphene and the metallic substrate can be modified by placing different species ( atoms of metals or non - metals , molecules , like co , h@xmath0o , or c@xmath3 ) underneath graphene  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of such studies is to decouple graphene from the metallic substrate , that in most cases changes the doping level of graphene ( and even its sign ) and to restore the original linear dispersion of the graphene - derived states in the vicinity of the fermi level . here",
    "arpes and sts techniques allow to perform electronic structure studies on the macro- or / and nm - scale giving information about doping level , gap opening , band dispersion and renormalization , and also providing new physics , which shed light on the new phenomena in graphene  @xcite .    in the present work we demonstrate the application of space - integrated ( arpes ) and local ( sts ) spectroscopic methods in combination with density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations for investigation of the electronic band structure of the graphene - based intercalation systems on metals : gr / cu / ir(111 ) and gr / o / ru(0001 ) .",
    "both systems show the electronic properties ( doping level and band dispersions ) which are different from those for the parent systems , demonstrating the effective ways to tailor physical and chemical properties of the graphene / metal interface .",
    "this work is an extended review of the previously published results  @xcite .",
    "graphene in both experiments was prepared on hot metallic substrates ( preliminary cleaned by cycles of ar@xmath4-sputtering / annealing ) via decomposition of c@xmath0h@xmath5 at a partial pressure of @xmath6 mbar .",
    "intercalation of cu in gr / ir(111 ) was performed via annealing of the cu / gr / ir(111 ) system with a nominal thickness of cu - layer slightly more than @xmath7ml .",
    "the process of intercalation was monitored in the _ live_-xps ( x - ray photoelectron spectrosocpy ) experiments .",
    "oxygen intercalation in gr / ru(0001 ) was performed with a stainless steel pipe , which end was placed in the close vicinity of the sample surface , at the relatively high gas pressure ( @xmath8 mbar ) and sample temperature of @xmath9c .",
    "homogeneity and cleanness of the systems before and after intercalation were controlled in the respective stm , xps , and arpes experiments .",
    "the more detailed description of the sample preparation procedures can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "all prepared samples were characterized at room temperature by means of stm / afm performed with spm aarhus 150 equipped with kolibrisensor . in these measurements",
    "the sharp w - tip was used , which was cleaned _ in situ _ via ar@xmath4 -sputtering . in the presented stm images the tunnelling bias voltage , @xmath10 ,",
    "is applied to the sample .",

    "@xmath11 spectroscopy and mappings were performed at low temperatures using the lock - in - technique with a modulation voltage of @xmath12mv and a modulation frequency @xmath13hz .",
    "arpes experiments were performed in the uhv station equipped with specs phoibos150/2d - ccd analyzer and ar / he uv - light source .",
    "the sample was placed on a 5-axis motorized manipulator , allowing for its precise alignment in the @xmath14 space .",
    "the sample was azimuthally pre - aligned in such a way that the polar scans were performed along the @xmath15 direction of the graphene - derived bz with the photoemission intensity on the channelplate images acquired along the direction perpendicular to @xmath15 .",
    "the final 3d data sets of the photoemission intensity as a function of kinetic energy and two emission angles were transformed in the respective data sets for the reciprocal space , @xmath16 for the careful analysis , where @xmath17 is the binding energy of electrons and @xmath18 are two orthogonal components of the wave vector in bz .",
    "part of arpes and xps experiments on the intercalation process studies was performed at bessyii ( hzb berlin ) .",
    "the dft calculations were carried out with the ` vasp ` program  @xcite using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite , a plane wave basis set , and the generalised gradient approximation as parameterised by perdew _ et al . _",
    "the plane wave kinetic energy cutoff was set to @xmath19ev .",
    "the long - range van der waals interactions were accounted for by means of the dft - d2 approach  @xcite .",
    "the supercells used to model the graphene - substrate interfaces are constructed from a slab of @xmath20 metal layers with a graphene layer adsorbed from one side and a vacuum region of approximately @xmath21 . in the case of graphene / ir(111 ) and graphene / cu / ir(111 )",

    "to avoid interactions between periodic images of the slab , a dipole correction is applied . during the structure relaxation , the positions of the carbon atoms as well as those of the top two layers of metal atoms ( as well as oxygen atoms in the case of graphene / o / ru(0001 ) )",

    "such an effect was explained by the formation of the corresponding interface states between graphene and ir(111 ) as a result of an overlap between graphene @xmath32 and ir@xmath33 states  @xcite . for graphene on ru(0001 )",
    "the _ direct _ imaging contrast is prevailed in stm images for low bias voltages due to the domination of the topographic contribution in the stm imaging  @xcite .",
    "intercalation of cu and oxygen in gr / ir(111 ) and gr / ru(0001 ) ( figure  [ scheme_stm ] , bottom row ) , respectively , conserves the periodicity of the moir lattices ( pseudomorphic growth of cu at the gr / ir interface  @xcite and @xmath34-o structure at the gr / ru interface  @xcite ) , but leads to the dramatic changes in the stm imaging contrast .",
    "after intercalation the imaging contrast is _ direct _ for gr / cu / ir(111 ) and the stm contrast for gr / o / ru(0001 ) becomes extremely flat .",
    "such changes in the imaging contrast for both systems are the reflection of the respective modifications in the electronic structure of graphene on the corresponding support and they are the subjects of the further arpes and sts studies of the respective systems .    in order to control the formation of the gr / cu / ir(111 ) system , which stm images might be , at some imaging conditions , similar to those of gr / ir(111 ) , the process of cu intercalation under graphene on ir(111 ) was monitored in the _ live_-xps measurements , where c@xmath35 and ir@xmath36 core levels were acquired as functions of time with sample temperature ramped from room temperature to @xmath37k .",
