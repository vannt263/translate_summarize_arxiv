    "this concept was first introduced by erds @xcite in 1950 , who constructed an infinite arithmetic sequence of odd integers not representable as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 a prime ) using a covering system .",

    "for exact covering systems in number field @xmath8 , very recently , in @xcite , s. kim proved that any modulus of the largest norm must be repeated when @xmath8 is a certain quadratic field with additional conditions on the modulus ideals @xmath30 .",
    "we are going to prove the analogous results in @xcite and @xcite for exact covering systems in any number field @xmath8 .",

    "both results greatly generalize the result of s. kim in @xcite .",

    ", we first introduce the important concept of parallelotope from @xcite .    for @xmath49 with @xmath50 ,",
