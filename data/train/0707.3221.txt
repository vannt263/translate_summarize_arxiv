    "an intrinsic feature of these processes is , that they obey markov properties @xcite .",
    "therefore , two point statistics are sufficient for a complete description of these processes .    in recent years , processes exhibiting anomalous diffusion , @xmath0 with @xmath1 , increasingly have attracted attention @xcite .",
    "such processes typically are realised in complex environments such as porous and disordered media , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "in contrast to ordinary diffusion , markov properties do not hold for these processes .",
    "therefore , multipoint joint statistics have to be considered for proper description of the dynamics .",
    "likewise , two alternative approaches to these processes have been evolved . on the one hand , these processes can be described by means of fractional fokker - planck equations , that contain fractional derivatives with non - local character . on the other hand ,",

    "a number of publications addressed statistical properties of trajectories of this approach @xcite .",

    "a broad class of distributions is feasible for this purpose . the continuous langevin formulation of fogedby , equations ( [ eqn : fogedby ] ) , however , requires the associated distributions to be stable in order to be properly defined . for a short introduction into the concept of stable distributions",
    "we refer to @xcite . in the long time limit",
