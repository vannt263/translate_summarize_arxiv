    "the theory of @xmath0 gravity has attracted a lot of attention recently . theoretically , there are no principles prohibiting the inclusion of higher order curvature invariants , such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their scalar functions , into the einstein - hilbert action , as long as the various constraints from local and cosmological observations are satisfied .",
    "practically , appropriate choices of these correction terms could modify the late behavior of the universe drastically , thus giving the recently - observed accelerating expansion an explanation from an alternative theory of gravity . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider a specific model in which the correction is a polynomial of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and their analysis shows that there exist late - time accelerating attractor solutions .",
    "meanwhile , models with @xmath6 corrections are discussed within the palatini approach @xcite , in which the field equations are second order , and similar acceleration solutions are found . this palatini-@xmath0 theory of gravitation",
    "is then tested using various cosmological data such as supernovae ( sn ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) shift parameter , baryon oscillation and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , in @xcite .",
    "recently , the constraints from cmb and matter power spectra are obtained for the typical case of @xmath2 in @xcite , which successfully exclude most of the parameter space , making the model indistinguishable from the standard @xmath8 in practice . as the corrections to general relativity ( gr ) in this model , which act as an effective dark energy component , become important only at very late times ( or very low energy densities ) , these works almost exclude the possibility of modifying theory of gravity in the @xmath0-manner at late times .",
    "however , there remains the possibility that @xmath0 modification to gr occurs in the earlier time .",
    "obviously , the successful predictions of bbn and primary cmb require that effects from this modification can not be significant during these earlier times .",
    "thus we will concentrate in this work on the case where the @xmath0 modification becomes important during some intermediate times between recombination and present . to be specific",
    ", we shall consider a class of @xmath0 gravity model with the form @xmath9 , the so - called _ exponential @xmath0 gravity model _",
    ", which , as shown below in sec .",
    "iii  a , well possesses the desirable property of modifying gravitational theory at intermediate cosmic times ( energy densities ) .",
    "a similar model has been considered in @xcite using the metric approach , and an early - time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect - large scale structure ( lss ) cross correlation is found there , which is potentially useful for distinguishing this model from others . here",
    ", however , we shall analyze it using the palatini approach and exactly calculate its cmb and matter power spectra by numerically solving the covariant perturbation equations given in @xcite ; comparisons with the model @xmath10 and @xmath8 would also be presented and discussed .",
    "this work therefore contributes to filling in the gap in constraining @xmath0 cosmology throughout the cosmic history .",
    "this work is organized as the following : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the model and list the background and perturbation evolution equations that are needed in the numerical calculation . in sec .",

    "iv . throughout this work",
    "we will adopt the unit @xmath11 and only consider the case of a spatially flat ( background ) universe without massive neutrinos .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the main ingredients of @xmath0 gravity in palatini formulation and list the general perturbation equations in this theory .",
    "the starting point of the palatini-@xmath0 gravity is the einstein - hilbert action @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) with @xmath16 being defined as @xmath17 note that the connection @xmath18 is not the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath19 , which we denote as @xmath20 ; rather it is treated as an independent field in the palatini approach . correspondingly , the tensor @xmath21 and scalar @xmath22 are not the ones calculated from @xmath19 as in gr , which are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively in this work ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the matter lagrangian density @xmath26 , however , is assumed to be independent of @xmath18 , which is the same as in gr .",

    "this is the so - called structural equation @xcite which relates @xmath22 directly to the energy components in the universe : given the specific form of @xmath0 and thus @xmath32 , @xmath22 as a function of @xmath33 could be obtained by numerically or analytically solving this equation .",

    "since @xmath26 depends only on @xmath19 ( and some matter fields ) and the conservation law of the energy - momentum tensor holds with respect to it , we shall treat this metric as the physical one .",
    "consequently the difference between @xmath0 gravity and gr could be understood as a change of the manner in which the spacetime curvature and thus the physical ricci tensor @xmath23 responds to the distribution of matter ( through the modified einstein equations ) . in order to make this point explicit , we rewrite eq .",

    "we thus can choose @xmath97 as the independent parameters and numerically calculate @xmath83 from eqs .",

    "we have calculated the cmb spectrum of the present model using camb , with adiabatic initial conditions because the corrections to gr are expected not to influence initial conditions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 , where we have plotted the cmb spectra for @xmath113 and 500 .",
    "interestingly we see that the deviation from @xmath8 ( @xmath114 ) occurs roughly in the range @xmath115 , while for even smaller @xmath116 s it vanishes .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath117 model , in which drastic changes happen at @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the contributions from isw effect alone are also shown in fig .  2 , both for the @xmath82 and for the @xmath117 models .",
    "obviously these agree qualitatively with the behaviors of the modified cmb spectra in the two models , since at low @xmath116 s a significant late - time contribution comes from the isw effect .",

    "the evolutions of the potential @xmath123 for various @xmath130 s are plotted in fig .  3 , and these provide a qualitative explanation for fig .  2 .",
    "for the isw effect , we know that the photons typically travel through many peaks and valleys of the perturbation , and this leads to cancellations of the effects .",
    "mathematically this arises from the oscillatory property of the spherical bessel function @xmath132 : @xmath133/2\\gamma[\\frac{1}{2}(l+2 ) ] \\approx ( \\pi/2l)^{1/2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "thus if @xmath134 is a constant , then @xmath135 would roughly scale as @xmath136 for a specified @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath134 is not a constant , on the other hand , it must be weighted by @xmath137 at different times in the integration , and , as @xmath137 strongly peaks at @xmath138 , it is weighted more at @xmath138 for an @xmath116 . to be more explicit , for the scales we are interested in the isw",

    "3 it is clear that @xmath123 decays rapidly earlier in the @xmath142 model than in the @xmath2 model ( for such a comparison we could choose @xmath84 and @xmath143 such that their endpoints of the evolution paths of @xmath123 are nearly the same in fig .  3 , _ e.g.",
    "_ , @xmath144 and @xmath145 there ) . on the other hand , at very late times",
    "the evolution of @xmath123 in the exponential @xmath0 gravity is nearly the same as in @xmath8 .",
    "now consider the contribution from a specified @xmath130-mode : if @xmath116 is very large then @xmath146 will be so small that @xmath147 ; thus the contribution to this @xmath116 is negligible .",
    "if @xmath116 is very small , then the contribution to this @xmath116 will be similar to that in @xmath8 as @xmath148 . for the intermediate @xmath116 s ,",
    "since the larger @xmath116 is the smaller @xmath146 is , some sufficiently larger @xmath116 s would receive significant contribution from the isw effect if the massive decay of the potential occurs earlier ( at a time closer to @xmath146 ) .",
    "qualitatively this is why in fig .",
    "2 the isw effect for the @xmath82 model extends to larger @xmath116 s than that of the @xmath2 model and the differences from @xmath4 are reduced dramatically towards very - small @xmath116 s in the case of exponential @xmath0 gravity .    as for the cmb polarization spectra of the model ,",

    "as discussed extensively in @xcite , the response of this modified gravity to the spatial variations of matter distribution could be very sensitive ( this could also be seen from eq .",
    "( 24 ) above ) , and at small enough scales this feature would significantly affect the growth of density perturbations . to be explicit , at large enough @xmath130 s , the growth equation for the comoving energy density fluctuations @xmath154 could be written as @xcite @xmath155 in which @xmath156 and @xmath157 acts as an effective sound speed squared .",
    "for the present exponential @xmath0 theory we have seen from fig .  1 that @xmath158 , so that @xmath159 and the small scale density fluctuations will oscillate instead of growing according to eq .  ( 30 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath160 , then these small scale fluctuations will become unstable and blow up dramatically @xcite ; this does happen in the @xmath161 model if @xmath143 is positive @xcite , but not for our choices of parameters in the @xmath162 model .",

    "from this figure we see that @xmath163 will hopefully be excluded when tested against the measurements on matter power spectrum from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , which is more stringent than the possible cmb constraints",
    ".    it will also be interesting to consider when the deviations of the matter power spectrum from the @xmath8 case occur in the @xmath0 gravity theories . since @xmath164 in the strict @xmath8 model",
    ", the deviation will appear when @xmath165 is significantly nonzero , and it thus appears earlier if @xmath106 begins to evolve earlier .",
    "5 confirms this expectation : it is apparent that for the @xmath166 model the deviation from the @xmath8 matter power spectrum has almost shaped up before @xmath167 while for the @xmath2 model this happens much later .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the background evolution , cmb and matter power spectra of a class of early @xmath0 gravity model , which takes the form of @xmath166 .",
    "such a model has the interesting feature that the deviation from @xmath8 happens only at some intermediate time , and this is why its cmb and matter power spectra are rather different from those in either the @xmath8 case or some late - time @xmath0 gravity theories , such as @xmath2 . for the cmb spectrum ,",
    "the earlier massive decay of the potential extends the isw effect to larger @xmath116 s , leaving the isw at very low @xmath116 s indistinguishable from that in @xmath8 .",
    "consequently the deviation from the latter is most significant at intermediate @xmath116 s ( @xmath168 ) , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for the matter power spectrum , the modifications to gr lead to the appearance of effective pressure fluctuations , which restricts the growths of small - scale density perturbations and leads to oscillations in small scales of the spectrum .",
    "it is interesting that , the deviation from @xmath8 matter power spectrum develops rather early in the early @xmath0 gravity model because @xmath106 here begins to evolve earlier .",
    "since the matter power spectrum directly shows the density perturbations while the cmb spectrum does not , the former is more sensitive to corrections to gr in @xmath0 gravity , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the constraints from local ( solar system ) measurements plus the sdss data might be able to restrict the parameter @xmath84 into a rather narrow range , roughly @xmath169 , but an exact constraint obtainable through carefully searching the parameter space with , say , the markov chain monte carlo method is beyond the scope of the work here .",
    "the present work therefore contributes to filling in the gap in constraining @xmath0 corrections to gr at some higher redshifts than when the late - time accelerating expansion of our universe begins ; it shows that such early @xmath0 cosmologies are strongly disfavored by current data on cmb and matter power spectra , just as their late - time correspondences such as the model @xmath170 .",
