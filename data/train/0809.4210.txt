    "at drexel university , i was testing the 8-inch , 13 stages , r1408 pmts which will be used for the inner vetos of the double chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "these pmts were used in the imb @xcite and superkamiokande @xcite experiments .",
    "this testing allowed a better understanding of their working . in this paper",
    "i propose a model inspired from observations during the testing period .",
    "the first aim of this model is to explain in simple way the saturation characteristics of the pmt .",
    "the model gives a global description of how the different pmts characteristics , like the quantum efficiency ( qe ) or the collectivity efficiency ( ce ) , are linked together to the pmt gain ( g ) .",
    "the model is compared to the data obtained from three different pmts , which have different single photoelectron ( spe ) distributions .",
    "the basic idea is at a fixed applied high voltage , the pmt works as charge amplifier , which will amplify below a certain charge limit @xmath0 and beyond this limit the pmt will continue to amplify the signal but at lower gain . as the signal in the input of the pmt",
    "is increased , the pmt gain decreases .",
    "a general profile which matches this description of the gain variation is given by :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a real coefficient which can be determined from the comparison with the data , @xmath3 is the collected charge at the anode and @xmath4 is the gain at the limit as @xmath5 , and depends only on the applied high voltage like following @xcite :    @xmath6    where k is a constant , which depends on the material of the dynodes and the voltage division between them , n is the number of the dynodes and @xmath7 is between 0.7 and 0.8 .",
    "@xmath4 is usually set up by appropriate high voltage at low light level ( single photoelectron level ) .",
    "the @xmath0 is an intrinsic constant to each pmt , and it depends only on the type of the voltage divider .",
    "@xmath0 fixes the amplification performance of the pmt at a given high voltage , and it determines the collectivity efficiency of the pmt . the amplification performance can be adjusted by the use of the appropriate voltage divider .",
    "the 8-inch hammamatsu r1408 pmt with 13 stages does not have a single photoelectron peak .",
    "figure [ cap : r1408_spe ] shows the r1408 single photoelectron ( spe ) charge distribution .",
    "the main method to determine the gain g for this kind of pmts is the photo - statistics method @xcite .",
    "a series of led / laser runs are taken at varying light levels , and for each run the statistical mean and variance of the spectra are measured as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : r1408_led_pulse_lin ] , after that plot the variance versus the mean , and fit the linear region with a polynomial of the first order like in fig .",
    "[ cap : r1408_lin_gain ] .",
    "the gain is extracted from the slope of the fit following the equation @xcite : @xmath8    where e and @xmath9 are the mean and the variance of the adc charge distribution , given by the following relations :    @xmath10    @xmath11    with @xmath12 is the electron charge , q is the mean charge at the input of the adc . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mean and the variance of the adc pedestal distribution .",
    "one important feature of the photo - statistics method is that it is adc pedestal independent .",
    "the r1408 pmt was put under high voltage inside a dark box , illuminated by an led driven by a fast pulser .",
    "the trigger output of the pulser was sent to lecroy 222 gate and delay units , first to set a delay , and then to produce a 200 ns gate which enclosed the pmt pulse that occurred when the led was flashed , the using setup is shown in fig . [",
    "cap : setup ] .",
    "the pmt signal was sent to the input of a lecroy 2249w adc , while the gate was coming from the 200 ns gate and delay output .",
    "the led was flashed at 20 hz at a variety of driving voltages from 1v to 8v , all with very narrow ( 20 ns ) driving pulse widths . in all cases ,",
    "the pmt pulse was observed on an oscilloscope to be completely contained within the 200ns adc gate . for each of the adc distributions , the mean and variance",
    "were calculated , as it discussed above , and the adc variances were plotted as a function of the adc means which allowed determination of the gain @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 was calculated from the linear region obtained at low led driving voltages .    to compare the model to the data ,",
    "the variance need to be written as function of the measured charge q. if the equation [ variance ] is combined with the equation [ gain ] , we obtain the following relation :    @xmath15    because the equation [ generalvar ] is the theoretic variance , it does not contain any adc pedestal variance term .    for large q , the variance can be written like following : @xmath16    there are three cases of interest : +    1 .",
    "@xmath17 2 .",
    "@xmath18 3 .",
    "@xmath19    figure [ cap : variance_q ] shows the variation of the variance obtained from equation [ generalvar ] as function of q , for different values of @xmath2 . + as shown in the fig .",
    "[ cap : r1408_lin_gain ] the variance shows a kind of saturation for high collected charge @xmath3 , which corresponds to the case @xmath20 . + figure [ cap : r1408_lin_1600v ] shows the comparison of the model with the data obtained from the r1408 pmt at different applied high voltages , this pmt has a linear ( or equally distributed ) voltage divider .",
    "the reference @xcite has more details about the voltage dividers and their different types , especially chapter 5 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 depends on the applied high voltage , and it is determined as explained above from the slope of the linear region .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is adjusted to reproduce the data , and the model reproduces the measurements with @xmath21 .      to improve the saturation performance of the pmt , a tapered voltage divider @xcite",
    "is used instead of the linear one , but the gain is expected to become lower for the same total applied high voltage .",
    "details about the linear and tapered voltage divider , which were used during the measurements , will be given in a separate paper about the double chooz inner veto pmts testing performed at drexel university @xcite .",
    "figure [ cap : r1408_yk_1600v ] shows the comparison of the model with the data obtained from the measurements with the r1408 pmt at different applied high voltages , this time the pmt has a tapered voltage divider .",
    "as expected the tapered voltage divider increases the value of @xmath0 , which became at least 4 times larger .",
    "in addition , the model reproduces the measurements with @xmath21 .",
    "i want conclude this section with one remark about the effect of the voltage divider .",
    "since the tapered divider enhances the collectivity efficiency , the gain can be expected to become lower at the same applied high voltage the gain due to the increasing of the collected charge at the anode",
    ". the assumption will be true if the gain depends only on the collected charge at the anode .",
    "however as it proposed by the equation [ gain ] , the gain does not depend on the collected charge q , but it depends on the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the tapered voltage divider will increase q and @xmath0 at the same time , then if they are increased in the same way , their ratio will remain constant and the gain will not be different from the one obtained with the linear voltage divider at the same applied total high voltage .",
    "the 8-inch hammamatsu r5912 pmt has a single photoelectron peak as shown in the fig .",
    "[ cap : r5912_spe ] . in order to apply the model to the case ,",
    "a general formulation of the variance has to be found .",
    "the equation [ variance ] can be written in a general way like following @xcite :    @xmath23    @xmath24 is a factor depending on the single photoelectron charge distribution of the pmt .",
    "since the interest of this paper is to explain the saturation profile of the pmt , it is enough to express the equation [ generalvar ] like following :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , s is the slope of the linear region when the variance is plotted as function of the measured charge @xmath3 .",
    "+ figure [ cap : r5912_1600v ] shows the comparison of the model with the data obtained from the r5912 pmt , this pmt came already encapsulated with its own voltage divider .",
    "the procedure for the gain measurement is exactly the same as for the r1408 pmt like described above .",
    "the model reproduces the data with @xmath27 in this case , too .      in this section ,",
    "i compare the model to the data obtained with a new kind of pmt , the mcp - pmt .",
    "@xcite contains a general description of this type of pmts .",
    "the data which i used for the comparison with the model is published in the ref .",
    "@xcite . to compare to the data ,",
    "the following equation is used :    @xmath28    the equation [ gphoton1 ] gives the gain variation as function of the number of the incident photons @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the number of incident photons at which the pmt saturation occurs .",
    "@xmath30 is directly determined from the data as the value of @xmath29 which corresponds to the ratio @xmath31 .",
    "the demonstration of the equation [ gphoton1 ] is made in the appendix .",
    "figure [ cap : mcppmt ] shows the results of the comparison .",
    "also in this case , the model reproduces the data .",
    "to describe some of the known properties of the photomultiplier tubes , a pmt model is proposed .",
    "the pmt characteristics like the quantum efficiency , the collectivity efficiency and the gain are linked together in natural way as demonstrated in the appendix .",
    "the model is successful to describe the saturation profile measured for three different pmts with different single photoelectron charge distributions .",
    "the comparisons with the measurements show that the value of the coefficient @xmath2 is 2 . the effect of the voltage divider - on the gain variation and the saturation performance - is explained in the model by the variation of the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "i want express my gratitude to prof .",
    "charles lane for initiating me to the pmts calibration techniques and for many helpful discussions .",
    "also , i want thank prof .",
    "r. svoboda for providing the r5912 pmt .",
    "the equation [ master ] can be considered as the master equation of the pmt , which links the observables of the pmt to each other , the quantum efficiency via @xmath32 , the collectivity efficiency represented by @xmath0 and the gain g.                                  @xmath46 characterizes the saturation level of the pmt at a given high voltage .",
    "if the equation [ g0 ] is used with the equation [ qsat ] , @xmath46 can be expressed as function of the applied high voltage :      since the value of @xmath0 depends only on the type of the voltage divider , the number of the photoelectrons at the saturation decreases with increasing applied high voltage for a given pmt with a given voltage divider .",
    "+ using the equations [ gain_mu_2 ] , [ mu_qe ] and [ qsat ] , the gain can be written as function of the number of incident photons @xmath29 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
