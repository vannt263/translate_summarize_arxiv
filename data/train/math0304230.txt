    "-5 mm    converse theorems traditionally have provided a way to characterize dirichlet series associated to modular forms in terms of their analytic properties . most familiar are the converse theorems of hecke and weil .",
    "hecke first proved that @xmath1-functions associated to modular forms enjoyed `` nice '' analytic properties and then proved `` conversely '' that these analytic properties in fact characterized modular @xmath1-functions .",
    "weil extended this converse theorem to @xmath1-functions of modular forms with level .    in their modern formulation ,",
    "converse theorems are stated in terms of automorphic representations of @xmath2 instead of modular forms .",
    "jacquet , piatetski - shapiro , and shalika have proved that the @xmath1-functions associated to automorphic representations of @xmath2 have nice analytic properties via integral representations similar to those of hecke .",
    "the relevant `` nice '' properties are : analytic continuation , boundedness in vertical strips , and functional equation .",
    "converse theorems in this context invert these integral representations .",
    "they give a criterion for an irreducible admissible representation @xmath3 of @xmath2 to be automorphic and cuspidal in terms of the analytic properties of rankin - selberg convolution @xmath1-functions @xmath4 of @xmath3 twisted by cuspidal representations @xmath5 of @xmath6 of smaller rank groups .",
    "to use converse theorems for applications , proving that certain objects are automorphic , one must be able to show that certain @xmath1-functions are `` nice '' . however , essentially the only way to show that an @xmath1-function is nice is to have it associated to an automorphic form .",
    "hence the most natural applications of converse theorems are to functoriality , or the lifting of automorphic forms , to @xmath0 .",
    "more explicit number theoretic applications then come as consequences of these liftings .",
    "recently there have been several applications of converse theorems to establishing functorialities .",
    "these have been possible thanks to the recent advances in the langlands - shahidi method of analysing the analytic properties of general automorphic @xmath1-functions , due to shahidi and his collaborators @xcite . by combining our converse theorems with their control of the analytic properties of @xmath1-functions many new examples of functorial liftings to @xmath0",
    "have been established .",
    "these are described in section 4 below .",
    "as one number theoretic consequence of these liftings kim and shahidi have been able to establish the best general estimates over a number field towards the ramamujan - selberg conjectures for @xmath7 , which in turn have already had other applications .",

    "the proof of theorem 1 with @xmath30 empty and @xmath57 replaced by @xmath58 essentially follows the lead of hecke , weil , and jacquet - langlands .",
    "it is based on the integral representations of @xmath1-functions , fourier expansions , mellin inversion , and finally a use of the weak form of langlands spectral theory . for theorems 1 and 2 where we have restricted our twists either by ramification or rank",
    "we must impose certain local conditions to compensate for our limited twists . for theorem 1 are a finite number of local conditions and for theorem 2 an infinite number of local conditions .",

    "a minute s thought will then convince one that the primary application of these results will be to the lifting of automorphic representations from some group @xmath59 to @xmath0 .",

    "currently this requires us to take @xmath8 to be a number field . the _ functional equation _",
    "@xmath79 has been proved in wide generality by shahidi @xcite .",
    "the _ boundedness in vertical strips _ has been proved in close to the same generality by gelbart and shahidi @xcite . as for",
