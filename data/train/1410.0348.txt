    "the icecube collaboration has quite recently reported the discovery of extraterrestrial neutrinos , including 3 events with well - measured energies around 1  pev , but notably no events have been observed above about 2  pev  @xcite . at @xmath0  pev ,",
    "one expects to observe a dramatic increase in the event rate for @xmath1 in ice due to the `` glashow resonance '' in which greatly increases the interaction cross section  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the effective detection area near this resonance becomes about 12 times larger than it is off - peak value  @xcite .",
    "however , under the assumption of democratic flavor ratios , only 1/6 of the total flux is subject to this enhancement . integrating the effective area for neutrino detection from 2 to 10  pev",
    ", we arrive at a factor 40 increase ( in the energy bin centered at the glashow resonance ) compared to the icecube sensitivity in the energy bin centered at 1   pev .",
    "this allows one to constrain the hypothesis that the neutrino spectrum follows an unbroken power law . under the hypothesis of an unbroken power law @xmath2 , the effective area between 2 and 10  pev together with the 3 observed neutrinos at @xmath3  pev leads an expectation of a flux which obeys @xmath4 . for zero events observed ( and none expected from background )",
    ", poisson statistics implies that fluxes predicting more than 1.29 events are outside the 68.27% cl  @xcite .",
    "consistency within 1  @xmath5 then requires @xmath6 for energies above about 2  pev .",
    "the event rate derived `` professionally ''  @xcite differs by a tiny factor from our back - of - the - envelope estimate .",
    "if we assume canonical fermi shock acceleration dominates below this energy , we would then require a break with a magnitude of roughly @xmath7 .",
    "we note in passing that the strong suppression observed in the ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) spectrum ( @xmath8 ) at @xmath9  eev corresponds to a spectral index change from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , or @xmath12",
    "this suppression may be due to interactions of uhecrs _ en route _ to earth , or it may represent a natural acceleration endpoint . indeed , composition data from the pierre auger observatory tend to favor the latter scenario , or possibly a combination of the two effects  @xcite .",
    "if the strong uhecr spectrum does indeed reflect an acceleration endpoint , it appears that the smaller cutoff of the energy spectrum for neutrinos could also plausibly be attributed to such an effect .",
    "hereafter we assume the spectral break does in fact represent an acceleration end point  @xcite .",
    "given the overall isotropy of the observed @xmath13 arrival directions and the fact that one of the 3 highest energy events arrives from outside the galactic plane , one might suspect an extragalactic origin for the extraterrestrial neutrinos .",
    "if the neutrino sources are extragalactic , the @xmath14-rays expected to accompany the @xmath13 s saturate the @xmath14 flux observed by the fermi satellite for a neutrino spectrum with @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis sketched above , taken together with the constraint on the spectral index derived from fermi measurements , points to a spectral cutoff , which precludes a rate increase near the glashow resonance .",
    "several explanations have been proposed to explain the origin of icecube s events  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a priori predictions for the diffuse @xmath13 flux from fri radiogalaxies  @xcite and starbursts  @xcite provide a suitable @xmath16 and normalization for the @xmath13 flux while simultaneously retaining consistency with a cutoff at @xmath17  @xcite . other potential sources that can partially accommodate icecube data include gamma - ray bursts  @xcite , clusters of galaxies  @xcite ( see however  @xcite ) , and active galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "however , the identification of extragalactic neutrino point - sources from a quasi - diffuse flux is challenging due to the ( large ) atmospheric neutrino background  @xcite .    on the basis of existing data a significant contribution from galactic sources can not yet be excluded  @xcite .",
    "searches for multiple correlations with the galactic plane have been recently reported by the icecube collaboration  @xcite .",
    "when letting the width of the plane float freely , the best fit corresponds to @xmath18 with a post - trial chance probability of 2.8% , while a fixed width of @xmath19 yields a p - value of 24% . in particular , some of the events seem to cluster near the galactic center  @xcite , which has been whimsically described as a neutrino lighthouse  @xcite . indeed",
    ", a particularly compelling source of some of these neutrinos could be ls 5039  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : uno ] contains a display of the shower and track events reported by the icecube collaboration  @xcite . using these data ,",
    "the collaboration conducted a point source search using an un - binned maximum likelihood method described in  @xcite . for both the clustering and point source search ,",
    "the number of estimated signal events , @xmath20 , is left as a free parameter and the maximum of the likelihood is found at each location . for the point source search , the most significant source is the binary system ls 5039 , with a value of @xmath21 , and a corresponding p - value of 0.002 .",
    "of course there are many sources in the sky ; whether this one turns out to be a good candidate , time will tell .    in summary",
    ", though the clustering is not statistically significant one can not rule out a galactic origin for some of these events .",
    "motivated by this fact we perform a generalized calculation of the flux expected from various source distributions , taking account of the location of the earth in the galaxy . in particular , we reduce the problem to two specific parameters , the distance to the nearest source and the overall population density .",
    "ls 5039 has been discussed in the literature as potential high energy neutrino emitter  @xcite .",
    "we consider this source as specific example and assume it typifies the population of galactic microquasars ( @xmath22qsos).qsos are a sub - class of x - ray binary systems that produce collimated outflows observed as non - thermal radio structures  @xcite .",
    "this particular morphology probably originates in relativistic jets launched from the inner parts of accretion disks around stellar mass black holes or neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "] we generalized the argument such that it can be applied to various source populations .",
    "first we bracket the realm of plausibility and consider a uniform distribution and an exponential distribution peaked at the galactic center . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we consider several conceivable different distances to the nearest source . after",
    "that we turn our attention to the interesting possibility of @xmath22qsos for which the overall distribution of surface density in the galaxy has a peak at galactocentric radii @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - dos ] we revisit the model presented in  @xcite in order to better estimate the expected neutrino flux , especially in the pev region . in sec .",
    "[ dos - extra ] we compare the properties of ls 5039 with other galactic microquasars , showing that ls 5039 provides a reasonable lower bound on the power of this type of source . in sec .",
    "[ sec - tres ] we estimate the contribution of galactic sources to the overall diffuse neutrino flux on the assumption that ls 5039 typifies the population . by comparing this estimate with icecube data",
    "we find the minimum neutrino production efficiency required to dominate the spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ cuatro - extra ] we employ constraints from @xmath14-ray observations to bolster our hypothesis .",
    "we also address the relevance of our previous finding  @xcite that a spectral index of 2.3 is consistent with the most recent icecube spectral shape as well as current bounds on cosmic ray anisotropy .",
    "our conclusions are collected in sec .",
    "[ sec - cuatro ] .",
    "ls 5039 is a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) system that displays non - thermal persistent and variable emission from radio frequencies to high - energy ( he ) , @xmath24 , and very - high - energy ( vhe ) , @xmath25 , gamma rays .",
    "the system contains a bright on6.5 v((f ) ) star  @xcite and a compact object of unknown nature .",
    "this degenerate companion has a mass between 1.4 and 5 @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the orbit of the system has a period of 3.9 days and an eccentricity around 0.35  @xcite .",
    "the distance to the source has recently been updated to @xmath27  @xcite . at the apastron",
    "the orbital separation of the binary system is @xmath28 and becomes @xmath29 at periastron  @xcite .",
    "variability consistent with the orbital period in the energy range @xmath30 was detected by fermi  @xcite .",
    "the system is also a tev emitter , with persistent , variable , and periodic emission , as detected by h.e.s.s .",
    "the overall luminosity in the frequency band @xmath31 is @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "whether the he / vhe gamma rays are a of hadronic or leptonic origin is a key issue related to the origin of galactic cosmic rays . in all gamma - ray binaries ,",
    "the nature of the compact object is fundamental for understanding the physical processes involved in the particle acceleration that is responsible for the multi - wavelength emission .",
    "if the compact object is a black hole , the accelerated particles would be powered by accretion , and produced in the jets of a @xmath22qso . on the other hand ,",
    "if the compact object is a young non - accreting pulsar , the particle acceleration would be produced in the shock between the relativistic wind of the pulsar and the stellar wind of the massive companion star .",
    "the detection of elongated asymmetric emission in high - resolution radio images was interpreted as mildly relativistic ejections from a @xmath22qso jet and prompted its identification with an egret gamma - ray source  @xcite .",
    "however , recent very long baseline array observations  @xcite show morphological changes on short timescales that might be consistent with a pulsar binary scenario  @xcite . on the other hand , no short - period pulsations were observed either in radio  @xcite or x - rays  @xcite definitively demonstrating the compact object to be a pulsar .",
    "new icecube data will clarify this situation , as the only plausible high energy neutrino emission mechanism requires a compact object powering jets .",
    "simultaneous production of @xmath14 s and @xmath13 s generally requires two components : _ ( i ) _ an effective proton accelerator , up to @xmath33 and beyond ; _ ( ii ) _ an effective target ( converter ) .",
    "the maximum observed neutrino energies then require proton acceleration up to at least @xmath34  pev .",
    "the most likely site for particle acceleration in ls 5039 is the jet , which with a speed @xmath35 and a half - opening angle @xmath36 extends out to 300 milliarcsecond ( mas ) , that is about @xmath37  @xcite . within the inner parts of the jet , with a radius @xmath38  cm",
    ", a magnetic field @xmath39 could be sufficient to boost protons up to very high energies .",
    "the maximum proton energy is determined by the hillas condition @xmath40 , which gives @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the larmor radius . a value compatible with this maximum energy has been obtained in an independent calculation  @xcite .",
    "the accelerated protons can interact efficiently with the ambient cold plasma throughout the entire jet . in what follows",
    "we assume that the base of the jet is located close to the inner parts of the accretion disk , that is , the jet axis @xmath43 is taken normal to the orbital plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] . here , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the schwarzschild radius . if the magnetic field drops as @xmath46 , the condition of the confinement of protons in the jet , @xmath47 implies @xmath48=constant , where @xmath49 is the radius of the jet at a distance @xmath43 .",
    "thus , one may expect acceleration of protons to the same maximum energy @xmath50 over the entire jet region .",
    "however , if there is a faster drop of @xmath51 with @xmath43 , the protons at some distance @xmath52 from the compact object will start escaping the jet . if this happens within the binary system , i.e. @xmath53 , protons interacting with the dense wind of the optical star will result in additional @xmath14-ray and neutrino production outside the jet .",
    "if the jet power is dominated by the kinetic energy of bulk motion of cold plasma , the baryon density of the jet @xmath54 can be estimated from the jet power , @xmath55 the efficiency of @xmath14-ray production in the jet is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the luminosity of vhe @xmath14-rays and @xmath58 is the power of accelerated protons .",
    "here , @xmath59  mb is the cross - section of inelastic @xmath60 interactions , and @xmath61 is the fraction of the energy of the parent proton transfered to a high energy",
    "@xmath14-ray  @xcite .",
    "given the recent estimate of the black hole mass in ls  5039 @xmath62  @xcite , we set @xmath63 . for the profile of the number density ,",
    "we adopt a power law form @xmath64 , where @xmath65 for a cylindrical geometry , @xmath66 for a conical jet , and @xmath67 for the intermediate case . expressing the acceleration power of protons in terms of the total jet power , @xmath68 ,",
    "one finds the following requirement for the jet power , @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the acceleration efficiency .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 characterizes the geometry / density profile of the jet : for @xmath73 , we find @xmath74 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the cylindrical geometry provides the highest efficiency of @xmath14-ray production .",
    "however , since @xmath75 ( assuming @xmath76 efficiency of proton acceleration , and taking into account that the fraction of energy of protons converted to @xmath14-rays can not exceed 30% ) the @xmath14-ray production can not be extended beyond @xmath77 .",
    "the conical geometry corresponds to the minimum efficiency of @xmath14-ray production , and thus the largest kinetic power of the jet . in this case",
    "the bulk of @xmath14-rays are produced not far from the base .",
    "for @xmath67 , @xmath14-rays are produced in equal amounts per decade of length of the jet , until the jet terminates .",
    "if @xmath14-rays are indeed produced in @xmath60 interactions , one would expect production of high energy neutrinos at a rate close to the @xmath14-ray production rate .",
    "however , since @xmath14-rays are subject to energy - dependent absorption , both the energy spectrum and the absolute flux of neutrinos , @xmath78,\\ ] ] could be quite different from that of the detected @xmath14-rays , where @xmath79 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath80 depends significantly on the location of the @xmath14-ray production region , and therefore varies with time if this region occupies a small volume of the binary system .",
    "this may lead to time modulation of the energy spectrum and the absolute flux of tev radiation with the orbital period  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath81 interactions generally can not be reduced to a simple effect of absorption .",
    "in fact , these interactions initiate high energy electron - photon cascades , driven by inverse compton scattering and @xmath81 pair production .",
    "the cascades significantly increase the transparency of the source .",
    "the spectra of @xmath14-rays formed during the cascade development significantly differ from the spectrum of @xmath14-rays that suffer only absorption .",
    "to model the electromagnetic cascade developed in the plasma we adopt the method described in  @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we include the three dominant processes driving the cooling of the electromagnetic cascade : photon - photon pair production , inverse compton scattering , and synchrotron radiation from electrons . because of the orbital motion ,",
    "both the absolute density and the angular distribution of the thermal radiation of the star relative to the position of the compact object vary with time .",
    "we take into account the effect induced by the anisotropic ( time - dependent ) distribution of the target photons on the compton scattering and pair - production processes  @xcite .",
    "we normalize the cascade spectrum of photons to the flux reported by the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration in the tev energy range  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if pion production is mostly dominated by collisions close to the base of the jet ( i.e. @xmath82 ) then the resulting flux of @xmath14-rays can marginally accommodate observations in the gev - range  @xcite .",
    "however , if pion production takes place well above the base of the jet ( @xmath83 ) the flux of gev - photons becomes about an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "these two extreme situations , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tres ] , provide an upper and a lower bound on the resulting neutrino flux @xmath84 where @xmath85 . the lower value of @xmath86 is in good agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .. good agreement is achieved by taking the fiducial value for the fraction of the jet kinetic energy which is converted to internal energy of electrons and magnetic fields .",
    "] it is notable that while our results are ultimately derived from demanding consistency between neutrino and photon data , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite are derived from assumption on source parameters . for a source distance @xmath87 ,",
    "the flux range given in ( [ fluxls ] ) corresponds to an integrated luminosity per decade of energy , @xmath88 in the range @xmath89 .",
    "herein we have assumed the usual fermi injection spectral index of @xmath90 .",
    "the spectral index of @xmath14-radiation measured by h.e.s.s . varies depending upon the orbital configuration , reaching a maximum value of 2.53  @xcite . in the next two sections we will assume the `` traditional '' spectral index . in sec .",
    "[ cuatro - extra ] we comment on the effect of a steeper spectrum .",
    "determining whether this analysis can be straightforwardly generalized to all sources in the galaxy depends on whether neutrino emission from ls 5039 can typify the population of @xmath22qsos .",
    "it is this that we now turn to study .",
    "the most recent catalogues show 114 hmxbs  @xcite and about 130 low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs )  @xcite .",
    "the integral / ibis nine - year galactic plane survey , limited to @xmath91 , contains 82 high - mass and 108 low - mass sources  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of this survey is about @xmath92 in the 17 - 60 kev energy band , which ensures detection of sources with luminosities @xmath93 within half of the galaxy ( @xmath94  kpc from the sun ) and @xmath95 over the entire galaxy ( @xmath96 from the sun ) ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : density ] .",
    "the number of x - ray binaries in the galaxy brighter than @xmath97 is thought to comprise 325 hmxbs and 380 lmxbs  @xcite .",
    "these estimates may be uncertain by a factor of approximately two due to our limited knowledge of the source spatial distribution , rendering them consistent with the observations from the surveys reported above . taken together this suggests an upper limit of @xmath22qsos in the galaxy of @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "about twenty @xmath22qsos have been discovered so far .",
    "an illustrative sample can be found in table  [ microquasartable ] .",
    "note that the estimated jet luminosity of ls 5039 is relatively low , implying that we can in principle use this source to estimate a lower bound on the neutrino production efficiency required to be consistent with observation .",
    "note also that the only source with @xmath99 less than that for ls 5039 has been observed in bursting and quiescent states . in table",
    "[ microquasartable ] we quote the quiescent value which is about a factor of two lower than for the case of bursting state  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is worth commenting on an aspect of this analysis which may seem discrepant at first blush .",
    "we find that some 500 @xmath22qsos are required to satisfy energetics requirements , while current catalogs / estimates describe about 100 such known objects .",
    "this is not so worrying for the following reasons .",
    "first , we have considered only the lower bound on @xmath22qso jet luminosity , which may vary by up to three orders of magnitude in the catalog listings ( see table  [ microquasartable ] ) . in this sense",
    "our estimated required number of @xmath22qsos that can plausibly explain the icecube data is a conservative one .",
    "secondly , when considering the nearby source scenario we did not re - evaluate the background conditions , which would yield a smaller isotropic flux .",
    "again , this is a conservative path .",
    "thus , the analysis presented herein adheres to a `` cautious '' approach throughout , lessening ( or eliminating ) concerns about the discrepancy between our estimates of the required number of @xmath22qsos versus the cataloged quantities .",
    "we then conclude that @xmath22qsos could provide the dominant contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux recently observed by icecube .",
    "very recently the icecube collaboration has extended their neutrino sensitivity to lower energies  @xcite .",
    "one intriguing result of this new analysis is that the spectral index which best fits the data has steepened from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "if one assumes the neutrino spectrum follows a single power law up to about 10  gev , then the latest data from the fermi telescope  @xcite can be used to constrain the spectral index assuming the @xmath14-rays produced by the @xmath102 s accompanying the @xmath103 s escape the source .",
    "in such a scenario , fig .  [",
    "fig : fermi+icecube ] shows that only a relatively hard extragalactic spectrum is consistent with the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the galactic photon flux in the 10  gev region is about an order of magnitude larger than than the extragalactic flux ; this allows easier accommodation of a softer single power law spectrum . for the galactic hypothesis",
    ", however , one must consider an important caveat , namely that the expected photon flux in the pev range has been elusive  @xcite .",
    "however , a recent refined analysis of archival data from the eas - msu experiment  @xcite has confirmed previous claims of photons in the 10  pev region .",
    "this analysis also results in a larger systematic uncertainty at all energies , relaxing previously reported bounds in the pev range . while previous bounds were marginally consistent with non - observation of pev photons expected to accompany the icecube neutrinos  @xcite , this new less stringent bound is more comfortably consistent .",
    "there is an additional interesting consequence of the new icecube data .",
    "the neutrino spectral index should follow the source spectrum of the parent cosmic rays .",
    "we have shown elsewhere  @xcite that a spectral index of @xmath104 is required for consistency with current bounds on cosmic ray anisotropy .",
    "further credence regarding our best - fit spectral index has been recently developed via numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that our discussion regarding source energetics assumes the canonical fermi index of @xmath105 . given the current level of uncertainties on the atmospheric neutrino background , the spatial distribution and total number of microquasars , as well as the large variation in microquasar jet luminosities ( see table  [ microquasartable ] ) , shifting our assumed spectral index from @xmath105 to @xmath106 will have little impact on the arguments concerning energetics explored herein . in the future , improved measurements all - round will require a considerably more elaborate analysis , including detailed numerical simulations .",
    "motivated by recent icecube observations we have re - examined the idea that @xmath22qsos are high energy neutrino emitters .",
    "we considered the particular case of ls 5039 , which as of today represents the source with lowest p - value in the icecube sample of selected targets  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that if ls 5039 has a compact object powering jets , it could accelerate protons up to above about 30 pev .",
    "these highly relativistic protons could subsequently interact with the plasma producing a neutrino beam that could reach the maximum observed energies , @xmath107 .",
    "there are two extreme possibilities for neutrino production : _",
    "( i ) _ close to the base of the jet and _ ( ii ) _ at the termination point of the jet . by normalizing the accompanying photon flux to h.e.s.s .",
    "observations in the tev energy range  @xcite we have shown that , for the first scenario , photon absorption on the radiation field leads to a neutrino flux @xmath108 .",
    "should this be the case , the neutrino flux almost saturates the current upper limit reported by the antares collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the second possibility yields a flux of neutrinos which is about an order of magnitude smaller . _",
    "a priori _ these two extreme flux predictions are partially consistent with existing data .",
    "however , one can ask why a source with similar characteristics ( ls i + 61 303 ) which is in the peak of the field of view of icecube has not been already discovered . the current 90% cl upper limit on ls i + 61 303 reported by the icecube collaboration is",
    "@xmath109 , favoring neutrino production near the end of ls 5039 jets .",
    "we have also generalized our discussion to the population of @xmath22qsos in the galaxy .",
    "using the spatial density distribution of high - mass x - ray binaries obtained from the deep integral galactic plane survey and assuming ls 5039 typifies the @xmath22qso population we have demonstrated that these powerful compact sources could provide the dominant contribution to the diffuse cosmic neutrino flux . of course , a complete picture which accommodates all the shower events outside the galactic plane may well require an extragalactic component .",
    "indeed most of the istropic background is dominated by muon tracks . explaining the possible isotropy of shower events",
    "may eventually prove only to be possible by considering extragalactic sources .",
    "future icecube observations will test the ls 5039 hypothesis , providing the final verdict for the ideas discussed in this paper .",
