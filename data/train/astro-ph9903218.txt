    "complex rapid fluctuation of the x - ray emission is a common characteristic of galactic black - hole candidates and low - mass x - ray binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray variabilities on different time scales carry valuable informations about x - ray emitting regions .",
    "cygnus x-1 is the brightest source in the hard x - ray sky and the most studied galactic black hole candidate , its variability has been studied extensively .",
    "the fourier transformation is a powerful tool in timing analysis and a lot of important results on cyg x-1 variability , e.g. , the shape of power spectral density , the coherence function and time delays between soft and hard light curve variability , are derived with this technique .",
    "recently , with the fourier analysis technique and observation data of the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , a series of studies for different states of cyg x-1 have been done , e.g. , studies of temporal properties of cyg x-1 in the soft state ( @xcite ) , during the spectral transitions ( @xcite ) , and in the hard state ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , studying temporal properties of cyg x-1 has been done with analysis techniques in the time domain , e.g. , studying the shot - noise model by the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the light curves ( @xcite ) , analysis of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) between different energy bands ( @xcite ) , modeling the light curve of cyg x-1 by an autoregressive process ( @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency in a fourier power spectrum or cross spectrum does not simply correspond to a certain time scale in the time domain which the physical process causing the variation really occurs in .",
    "timing analyzing directly in the time domain is eventually necessary to study the variations on different time scales .",
    "temporal analyzing in the time domain usually requires the total amount of observed events and the signal to noise ratio of data much higher than that with the fourier analysis . to overcome this difficulty , negoro , miyamoto and kitamoto ( 1994 ) obtained average x - ray shot profiles from a _ ginga _ observation of cyg x-1 in the low state by superposing many shots through aligning their peaks and studied their properties .",
    "recently we made analysis of the structures of x - ray shots with the characteristic time scale @xmath3 s in the different states of cyg x-1 with pca/_rxte _ observations and an improved searching and superposing algorithm ( @xcite ) . from the obtained average shot profiles we have observed some interesting features , e.g. , the average hardness of shot is lower than that of steady emission in the transition and hard states but higher than that in the soft state , the shot profile in the high energy band is narrower than that in the low energy band , etc .",
    "these observed phenomena give valuable hints on the shot production mechanism . in this work we study the correlation properties between the hardness and intensity and the energy dependence of temporal profiles on different time scales and for general variabilities , not only for shots in @xmath4 s region .    as chaotic fluctuations of x - rays from cyg x-1",
    "are exhibited on wide time scales , from hours down to smaller than 1 ms , it is difficult to study the variation phenomena on a given time scale by simply using traditional analysis tools in the time domain , e.g. , the correlation coefficient , autocorrelation function and cross - correlation function .",
    "large time bin used in calculation will erase the information on shorter time scales . and",
    "the analysis result with a short time bin reflects not only the variation property on the short time scale , but is also affected by that on longer ones up to the total time period used in the calculation . in this work",
    "we make timing analysis of pca/_rxte _ observations of cyg x-1 by a modified approach in the time domain . for a given time bin @xmath5",
    ", we divide the total observation period into segments , each has a duration just several times of @xmath5 , say 10@xmath5 .",
    "the correlation coefficient , acf and ccf are calculated for each segment separately and the results are finally averaged .",
    "the resultant correlation coefficient , acf and ccf , should be then related to the limited time scale region of @xmath6 . in section 2",
    "we present our analysis of correlation between hardness and intensity by this approach .",
    "the difference of acf widths or time lag between low and high energy bands are usually much smaller than the time scale studied , which is another difficulty for timing analysis in the time domain .",
    "we try to use a technique similar to that in the vernier scale to measure the small difference in terms of a large time bin and present the results on energy dependence of temporal profiles of cyg x-1 x - ray emission on different time scales in section 3 .",
    "the implications of observed temporal and spectral characteristics to the production region and mechanism of cyg x-1 x - ray variations are discussed in section 4 .",
    "a series of observations of cyg x-1 had been performed by _ rxte _ in 1996 . on 1996",
    "may 10 ( 131 day of 1996 ) the all sky monitor on _ rxte _ revealed the cyg x-1 started a transition from the normal hard ( low ) state to the soft ( high ) state . after reaching the soft state , it stayed in this state for nearly 2 months before going back down to the hard state ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use data of pca/_rxte _ ( 260 kev ) in 11 observational periods , including three periods during the hard - to - soft transition , three the soft state , two the soft - to - hard transition and three the hard state .",
    "the typical time duration of a period is , say , @xmath7 s. two modes of pca data are used in our analysis .",
    "one is the event mode with 16 energy bands covering 13.160 kev with the time resolution of 16 @xmath8s .",
    "the other is single - bit mode including 26.5 kev and 6.513.1 kev bands ( or 25 kev and 513.1 kev bands for the used data of hard states ) with the time resolution of 125 @xmath8s .",
    "the version 4.1 of standard _ rxte _ ftools is used to extract the pca data and version 1.5a of the background estimator program to estimate the background .",
    "the corrections of collimator response and barycentric time are applied to the chosen data of an observation period .",
    "the background - subtracted light curves of the low energy band @xmath9 ( 26.5kev ) ( or 25 kev for the hard state ) , middle energy band @xmath10 ( 6.513.1kev ) and high energy band @xmath11 ( 13.160kev ) with a selected time bin @xmath5 can be obtained by rebinning and making background correction for each energy band respectively . from the three light curves we derive the profiles of intensity @xmath12(260kev ) and hardness ratio @xmath13 and",
    "use the correlation analysis to study the relationship between the x - ray intensity and hardness ratio .",
    "the correlation coefficient for @xmath14 pairs of @xmath15 values is defined as @xmath16    for a given time bin @xmath5 the studied observation period is divided into total @xmath17 segments with a duration of 10@xmath5 each . in our analysis ,",
    "a data bin is defined as an effective one if the total length of data gaps in the bin is less than 0.1@xmath5 , and just such segments are used in which the number of effective bins @xmath18 .",
    "we calculate the correlation coefficients @xmath19 of each segment @xmath20 by using eq.(1 ) , and then their average @xmath21 and standard deviation @xmath22 for the period .",
    "table 1 , 2 and figure 1 show the obtained averages of correlation coefficients between @xmath23 and @xmath12(260kev ) and their standard deviations for the 11 periods with time bin ( time scale ) 1 ms , 10 ms , 0.1 s , 1 s , 10 s , 20 s and 50 s respectively , where the hardness ration @xmath23 is determined by the two energy bands of 26.5 kev and 13.160 kev for the periods of soft and transition states and 25 kev and 13.160 kev for the hard states .",
    "the lower band range of single - bit mode of pca observations for the hard state of cyg x-1 in 1996 is a litter bit different with that of public observations for the soft and transition states , this difference will not considerably change the results in this work .",
    "figure 2 ( a)(d ) show the light curves and hardness ratio profiles in 50 s time bin and their trends smoothed by the least - square fitting for four example periods in different states . comparing the light curves ( fluctuated solid curves ) and the corresponding hardness ratio profiles ( fluctuated dotted curves ) in the four periods in different states",
    ", one can see that a near perfect correlation between the hardness and intensity is shown in the upper right - hand panel of fig.2 for the soft state , but rather complex feature , a mixture of positive and negative correlations , for other states .",

    "- correlations are always found in all observation periods . on the longer time scales ( 0.0150 s ) the correlation property when cyg x-1 in soft states is quite different with what in transition and hard states . for",
    "soft states , positive correlations between the hardness ratio @xmath23 and intensity @xmath12 exist on all time scales between 0.01 s and 50 s. the correlation coefficients @xmath24 increase monotonically and reach to near unity along with the time scale increasing from 0.01 s to 50 s. on the other hand , the correlation coefficients are negative or near zero when cyg x-1 is in transition or hard states .",
    "the error bars in tables 1 , 2 and figures 1 , 3 are derived from the standard deviations of the obtained correlation coefficients of all available segments . as",
    "the total number of correlation coefficients is always large for any state and time scale studied , their deviation can give a reasonable estimate of the statistical uncertainty in the derived average value .",
    "the increasing trend of the correlation coefficients with the time scale in the soft state and the difference between the correlation in the soft state and that in the other states are statistically significant .",
    "the fourier frequency - dependent time delays of high - energy photons relative to low - energy ones in the x - ray variations of cyg x-1 have been observed for some time and are attracting an increasing amount of attention to using it as a diagnostic of the emission mechanism and emitting region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , from analyzing many x - ray shots of cyg x-1 in different states we confirm the existence of time delays of hard photons behind soft photons in a shot ( @xcite ) . a notable finding from our shot analysis is that the shot profile in the high energy band is narrower than that in the low energy band , which is not consistent with the prediction of the simple comptonization models .",
    "it is important to study the energy dependence of temporal profiles of cyg x-1 in different states and on different time scales directly in the time domain .",
    "we take a procedure similar to that used in section 2 to derive the average width of the autocorrelation functions and study the temporal correlation of two light curves in different energy bands on different time scales . for a given time",
    "scale @xmath5 , the observation period studied is also divided into segments with a duration of @xmath32 each . the autocorrelation function of the zero - mean time series @xmath33 of a segment is usually defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the average intensity in the time bin @xmath37 .",

    "it is difficult to measure time lags @xmath46 . to get necessary resolution for time lags",
    "we modify the above definition of @xmath44 and @xmath45 that we can use a time bin @xmath47 for time lag . for the convenience",
    "we use the time instead of the bin number as the argument in the expression of @xmath44 and @xmath45 : use @xmath48 and @xmath49 to represent the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 at the time lag @xmath50 , @xmath51 the average intensity in the time duration @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we define the autocorrelation function of the light - curve @xmath12 @xmath54 and the cross - correlation function between two light - curves @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57    with the @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath58 , we can study temporal variations on the time scale of @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath32 with a necessary time resolution @xmath59 . for a studied observation and a given time bin @xmath5 ,",
    "the total observation period is divided into @xmath17 segments with a duration of @xmath32 each . for a segment @xmath60",
    "we calculate the autocorrelation function of the light curve in the low energy band , @xmath61 , and that in the high energy band , @xmath62 , with the time lag bin @xmath59 of 1 ms from eq.(4 ) , and also @xmath63 between the two bands from eg.(5 ) .",
    "we then find out the full width at half maximum , @xmath64 , from the profile @xmath61 , @xmath65 from @xmath62 , and the time delay @xmath66 of the high energy band relative to the low energy band .",
    "the time delay is determined by the maximum of the function @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath17 segments are divided into @xmath68 groups with the segment numbers @xmath69 in each group @xmath70 being nearly equal to each other and @xmath71 .",
    "the average of a concerned quantity @xmath72 ( @xmath72 can be @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) and its standard deviation for each group @xmath75 can be calculated by using the following formulas @xmath76 finally we report the result for the observation as @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 the first error term @xmath80 in the expression ( 7 ) represents the precision of @xmath81 as an average for the observation period , the second one @xmath82 describes the dispersion of the @xmath83 averages @xmath84 within the observation .",
    "we apply the formulas ( 6 ) ",
    "( 8) to calculate the average @xmath44 widths @xmath85 in the low energy band , @xmath86 in the high energy band , and the average time delay @xmath87 between the two bands for six observations and show the results in table 3  5 .",
    "from table 4 and 5 one can see that for all studied observations the temporal variations in the high energy band are always delayed relative to the low energy band on all time scales , and that on the time scale @xmath88 s the width of @xmath44 in the high energy band is generally narrower than that in the low energy band . for an example , figure 4 shows the average autocorrelation and cross - correlation functions of the low and high energy light - curves with the time bin @xmath88 s for the observation started at 143.7 day of 1996 when cyg x-1 in the transition from hard state to soft state .",
    "the total duration of the observation is about 2230 s. the total effective bins of 0.1 s are divided into @xmath68 groups , each group has about @xmath89 segments of 1 s. for the 10 groups , the @xmath44 width ratios , @xmath90 , are all smaller than unity , they are @xmath91 and @xmath92 . from the above values we finally obtain @xmath93 .",
    "the above results show that the width of @xmath44 in the high energy band being narrower than that in the low energy band is statistically significant for the observation . to compare our results on hard x - ray delay with that from fourier spectral analysis",
    ", we plot the time lags as a function of @xmath94 for four observations in figure 5 ( a)(d ) .",
    "the time lags vs. @xmath94 shown in fig.5 are similar with the time lags vs. fourier frequency obtained by fourier spectral analysis ( @xcite , fig.8 ; @xcite , fig.10 ) .",
    "there exists an obvious anti - correlation between the 2 - 60 kev intensity and spectral hardness of x - rays from cyg x-1 in its long - term variability exhibited by its state transition between low / hard and high / soft states .",
    "one can find from fig.2 that for the soft state the typical intensity is @xmath95 cts / ms and hardness ratio between the high and low energy bands @xmath96 , and for the hard state they are @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . for shorter time scales ,",
    "our analysis results show different correlation features in different states .    in a previous paper ( @xcite )",
    "we studied the spectral properties of average shots of cyg x-1 on the time scale of about 0.1 s in soft , hard and transition states and found that the hardness during a shot is higher than that of the steady component around the shot in soft states but lower in transition and hard states .",
    "fig.6(a ) ",
    "fig.6(d ) show the intensity and hardness ratio profiles of average shots in the different states of cyg x-1 , where the average shots were obtained by using the same data as that presented in this paper .",
    "we can see from fig.6(b ) that for the soft state the hardness ratio peaks while the flux of the shot peaks , showing a positive correlation between the hardness and intensity .",
    "for the hard state , although the average hardness of the shot is lower than that of the steady emission , but there exist both positive and negative peaks during the shot , as shown in fig.6(d ) , the net correlation for the shot should be quite small .",
    "for both the hard to soft transition state and the soft to hard transition state , the hardness variation during the shot is dominated by a negative peak , as shown in fig.6(a ) and fig.6(c ) , the correlation coefficient should be negative .",
    "in fact we can calculate the correlation coefficient between the profiles of flux and hardness ratio of a shot .",
    "the derived @xmath24 for shots in fig.6 within the range of @xmath99 s around the shot peak are @xmath100 for the hard to soft transition state , @xmath101 for the soft state , @xmath102 for the soft to hard transition state , and @xmath103 for the hard state , respectively .",
    "the state dependence of shot @xmath24 is generally consistent with what is shown in table 1 and fig.3 for the time scale of 0.1 s , except a considerable difference in quantity for the soft state .",
    "the shot of the soft state shows a nearly perfect correlation between the hardness ratio and flux , but the correlation coefficients for the soft state on 0.1 s time scale in table 1 and fig.3 are just about 0.3 . as the correlation analysis in this paper",
    "is made for the temporal variability on a certain time scale in general , not only for shots , the obtained correlation coefficient being smaller than that of shots reflects the existence of other uncorrelated variation components , including noise . for the hard and transition states , the consistency between the results from our general correlation analysis on the 0.1 s time scale and those for shots indicates the variable flux on the 0.1 s time scale being dominated by shots .",
    "the trend of the correlation coefficients @xmath24 increasing monotonically and reaching to near unity along with the time scale from 0.01 s to 50 s may indicate the effect of uncorrelated noise being weakened on larger time scales .",
    "the most remarkable result from our analysis is the state dependence of correlation features on the time scales of @xmath1 s@xmath104 s. the correlation coefficients @xmath105 are always positive during soft states but negative or near zero during transition and hard states .",
    "it is widely believed that hard x - rays of cyg x-1 come from inverse compton scattering of low energy seed photons by high energy electrons in an accretion disk corona ( adc ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) or hot advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the steady or slowly varied component of the observed hard x - rays should be a global average of emission from different regions of the hot corona ( adc or adaf ) , whereas a rapid variation can be produced at a local region where a disturbance occurs .",
    "the innermost region of the cold disk jointed with the hot corona is most probably a turbulent region where violent disturbances frequently take place and produce rapid varying low energy photons , causing variable x - ray emission through comptonization in the nearby region of the hot corona .",
    "the difference between the hardness ratios of the rapid varied component and steady component may be caused by a difference between the local temperature of the comptonizing region to produce the rapid varied emission and the average temperature of the total corona .",
    "two different geometries in the adc or adaf model exist .",
    "one is the sphere+disk geometry : a spherical corona around the centric compact object with exterior accretion disk . and",
    "another is the slab geometry : the comptonizing medium being a slab surrounding the disk .",
    "the predicted spectrum of comptonization models with the sphere+disk geometry ( @xcite ) can describe the observed x - ray spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard and transition states .",
    "the spherical corona exists only for accretion rates below some critical value . for the soft state ,",
    "the disk extends down to the last stable orbit and the hot flow is restricted to the corona surrounding the disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath106 of the disk is a function of radius : inner part has higher temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath107 of corona embedding the cold disk is related to the disk temperature @xmath106 : for the same value of the optical depth of the corona , the spectra of comptonized photons are harder in the case of higher @xmath106 ( @xcite ) . accordingly in the soft state with the slab geometry , the spectra of shots from the coronal region surrounding the innermost disk should be harder .",
    "on the other hand , for the transition and hard states the radial dependence of the coronal temperature in the central corona expected for an advection dominated accretion flow can be approximately represented as @xmath108 with @xmath109 being the distance from the center of the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the innermost orbit of the disk in the case of the sphere+disk geometry is located outside the spherical corona and its neighboring comptonizing region is the outer part of the corona with a temperature lower than the average of the total corona .",
    "thus , assume most of observed rapid variations take place at the joint region between the innermost disk and hot corona , the observed correlation character will be consistent with what is expected by the models mentioned above , and , in consequence , the average correlation coefficient of time segments with limited length will be a useful parameter to probe the corona geometry of x - ray binaries .",
    "another noticeable fact in our results is that the correlation coefficients @xmath24 on the 1 ms time scale listed in the third column of table 1 are all negative , regardless what state cyg x-1 was in .",
    "it is most probably an indication of the effect of compton cooling of the local comptonizing region by brief flashes . a considerable part of rapid variability of cyg x-1 consists of many aperiodically occurring shots with widths distributed between @xmath110 ms and @xmath111 s ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used time segments of 10 ms duration to determine the correlation coefficients in the case of 1 ms time bin . in case of a 10 ms segment being contained by a shot ,",
    "the average hardness in our correlation analysis reflects not the average temperature of total corona but that of local comptonizing region of the shot . for this case",
    "a brief flashes of seed photons will decrease the local temperature and then the hardness of emitted x - rays .",
    "temporal structures on the time scale of 0.1 s in the high energy band are narrower than that in the low energy band as shown in table 4 , which is consistent with the average shot structures on the time scale @xmath112 s in different energy bands obtained from pca/@xmath113 observations of cyg x-1 in different states ( @xcite ) , but contrary to the prediction of comptonization models ( @xcite ) .",
    "this observed fact , together with the characteristic correlations between hardness and intensity revealed by our correlation analysis and shot analysis in the time domain , has to be considered in modeling the production process of x - rays from cyg x-1 .",
    "the hard x - ray time lag of cyg x-1 , expected by comptonization process and revealed by fourier frequency analysis is also shown in our results .",
    "it is interesting to see the time lags as a function of @xmath94 ( fig.5 ) similar to that as a function of fourier frequency ( see , e.g. , @xcite , fig.10 ) . in comparison with the fourier frequency ,",
    "the time scale @xmath5 is more directly related to the real physical processes causing the rapid variabilities .",
    "at large time scales , @xmath114 s , average lags @xmath115 change significantly with time , causing large @xmath116 in the last column of table 5 and large error bars in the region of @xmath117 s@xmath118 in figure 5 .",
    "one can see from fig.5 that the correlation analysis technique in the time domain we proposed has the capability to study the time lags at the short time scale region ( or `` high frequency '' region @xmath119 s@xmath118 ) with an enough precision . in this paper",
    "we use time lag bin @xmath120 ms . a work of using higher time resolution data of @xmath113 to study time lags at the region @xmath121 s@xmath118 and correlations between hardness and intensity on time scales smaller than 1 ms is in the process , the results will be reported in a separate paper .",
