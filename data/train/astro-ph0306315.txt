    "_ blazars _ , are objects which emit energy in the entire electromagnetic spectrum , and are characterized by a variability which scales from long to short period . to understand the real nature of _ blazar _ , we need multiwavelenght simultaneous data , and we need to be able to analyze these data and to do numerical predictions to discriminate between the theoretical models . to the light of these simple but constraining remarks , we decide to write a simulator able to simulate the _ blazar _ energetic and temporal behavior .",
    "a large effort has been produced to ensure a numerical precision enough high to use this code to analyze data too .",
    "this work represents just the first step of our project , which will have many future developments . to make our simulation as complete as possible",
    ", we decided to implement the simulation of disk variability too . in the section _ 2 _ we present the simulation of the disk , section _ 3 _",
    "is dedicated to show how we can reproduce light curve both for ssc and ec model , taking into account for time crossing effects .",
    "the rapid quasi - fractal variability of _ blazar _ is one of the main signature for their temporal behavior .",
    "this kind of variability is common to many astrophysical objects ( sun spot , galactic accretion disk around black hole ecc .... ) .",
    "the cellar automata ( ca ) @xcite , @xcite is a fast and efficient way to simulate this variability , without the need of solving differential equations . in this work we used ca to simulate the variability of the accretion disk emission . in _ blazar _",
    "the jet axis is close to the observer line of sight , so luminous fluxes are dominated by the jet emission .",
    "this led us to the understanding that the x - ray fluctuation , are due mostly to the emitting blob , and not to the disk . therefore to have a quantitative indication about the behavior of an accretion disk acting around a super massive black hole ( bh ) ( @xmath0 ) , we try to simulate the disk emission of the seyfert galaxies , which have not significative contribute from jet emission .",
    "the analysis of the x - ray light curves for these objects @xcite , shows a behavior similar to the _",
    "1/f _ noise , so the psd of these light curves has almost the following form @xmath1 with the slope @xmath2 in the range @xmath3 .",
    "we than model our disk , tuning the input parameter , to obtain all the physical characteristic that are supposed to belong to an accretion disk around a super massive bh .",
    "we performed many simulation , and in fig [ fig : disk ] we show just the result closest to the condition we believe more realistic .",
    "to model the surface density of the disk , we used a parametrization @xcite , which relates the steady @xcite with the critical regime in the following way @xmath4\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath5 is fixed at the value of 0.5 , while the value of @xmath6 , has been varied from 10 to 90 @xmath7 .",
    "we found that the slope of the psd , varies with @xmath6 .",
    "the value of the slope closest to those of the syfert galaxies is for @xmath8 .",
    "we noted how the slope change with the gradual mass flow @xmath9 too , in good agreement with other simulations @xcite .",
    "we simulate the temporal evolution of the emitting plasma in the blob @xcite,@xcite , solving numerically the fokker planck equation , following the method of chang & cooper @xcite , and obtain light curves both for synchrotron @xcite , @xcite and ic / ec @xcite , @xcite , @xcite emission .",
    "than we reprocess these light curves taking into account for time crossing effects . here",
    "we present a simulation in which the light curve of the disk ( showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] ) constitutes the external photon field for the ec mechanism .",
    "we than assume that the broad line region ( blr ) reflection of the disk luminosity ( with an reflectivity @xmath10=0.0001 ) generates a quasi - isotropic photon field , and do not take into account for the radiation coming straightly from the disk .",
    "this light curve has a typical time scale in the disk frame of about @xmath11 .",
    "our simulator take into account for the relativistic transformation for time and frequencies , between the disk - blr frame and the blob frame and between the blob and the earth . in this simulation",
    "we assume that the blob moves toward the blr with a typical @xmath12 , so we use a beaming factor @xmath13 for every the transformation . in fig",
    "[ fig : extc ] we report the result for two different values of @xmath14 : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the number of slices into which we divide the blob is such that the time crossing of each slice in the blob frame is of 100 s , that is much shorter than @xmath17 which is the time scale variability of the disk seen by the blob frame .",
    "one of the main goal of our work , was understanding the connections between the accretion disk variability , and it s reprocessing by the emitting blob .",
    "we observed that the luminosity fluctuations , that are present in the disk , are seen by the observer , if the blob radius is such that photon time crossing is not much larger than typical disk variability time scale . in the future we aim to explore the connection between the disk instability and the disk fueling to the light of the internal shock scenario , to simulate the synchrotron rapid variability too , using a self consistent physical model .",
