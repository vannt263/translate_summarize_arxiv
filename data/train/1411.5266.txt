    "symbiotic stars ( systs ) are binary systems composed by a cool giant star and a hot companion , which can be a white dwarf , a main sequence star with accretion disc , or a neutron star .",
    "the wind expelled by the cool giant star accretes onto the hot companion powering the symbiotic activity , including occasional eruptions and jets .",
    "symbiotic systems display characteristic spectra , which allow their detection with on - off band techniques , in which narrow - band filters are tuned in to one or more typical emission lines . in an attempt to separate symbiotic systems from their most common mimic magrini ,",
    "corradi & munari ( 2003 ) used several diagnostic diagrams based on the fluxes obtained with the narrow - band filters h@xmath0 and  at 5007 .",
    "they concluded that it is , indeed , possible to discover symbiotic systems using their proposed diagrams , but it is not easy to discriminate them from planetary nebulae ( pne ) or compact   regions without a spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "they also estimated the expected number of symbiotic stars in a given galaxy , finding that it increases with the luminosity ( mass ) of the galaxy . for a galaxy like 205 , the second most massive dwarf companion of andromeda ( 3.3@xmath110@xmath2m@xmath3 ; mcconnachie 2012 ) , the predicted number of symbiotic stars is 1.7@xmath110@xmath4 ( magrini et al .",

    "their spectra revealed features that are characteristic of symbiotic systems ( see , e.g. , belczyski et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the optical , the spectra of symbiotics are indeed notable due to the absorption features and continuum of late - type m giants , strong nebular emission lines of balmer , the recombination lines of  and  and the forbidden lines of , ,  and . in more detail , the well - known criteria to identify symbiotic stars ( belczyski et al",
    ". 2000 ) are the following : _",
    "i ) _ the presence of the absorption features of a late - type giant ( like titanium and vanadium oxides , tio and vo , h@xmath19o , co and cn bands , as well as ca  i , ca  ii , fe  i and na  i absorption lines ) . _",
    "ii ) _ the presence of strong  and  emission lines and either emission lines of ions with an ionization potential of at least 35  ev ( e.g. ) , or an a- or f - type continuum with additional shell absorption lines from , , and singly - ionized metals .",
    "the latter corresponds to the appearance of a symbiotic star in outburst .",
    "_ iii ) _ the presence of the @xmath106830  emission feature , even if no feature of the cool star is found .",
    "also , very recently , lee , heo & lee ( 2014 ) identified another raman  scattered ne  vii @xmath10973 at 4881  line , in the spectrum of the galactic symbiotic star v1016 cygni .",
    "the latter scattering process is again a unique characteristic of symbiotic systems .",
    "the three systems in ngc  205 , hereafter 205  syst1 , 205  syst2 , 205  syst3 , show the following characteristics that led us to classify them , respectively , as true , possible and likely symbiotic binaries :    * 205  syst-1 shows the  raman scattered lines at 6830 , 7088 , unique signatures seen only in symbiotic stars ( schmid 1989 ) .",
    "these emission lines provide a firm classification criterion of symbiotic systems , even when the red giant continuum is not directly observed , as discussed above . moreover , in the present case the absorption features of the m giant component are clearly seen .",
    "the discovery of 205  syst-1 is similar to that of other systs in the local group ( lg ) galaxies , as in the case of ngc  6822 ( kniazev et al .",
    "2009 ) and ngc  185 ( gonalves et al .",
    "2012 ) , in which the  raman scattered lines were also detected . * 205  syst-2 , on the other hand , has an extremely intense  4686  emission line , property that is included among the classification criteria of systs ( fig .",
    "2 , middle panel ) . as a consequence of such an intense doubly ionized he emission , the effective temperature ( ) of the star that ionizes the gas should be tremendously high ( see next section ; 4.1 ) . in spite of a high ,",
    "it is puzzling the fact that higher ionization forbidden lines are not detected in its spectrum , unlike in syst-1 . a possible reason would be the fact that the present system is significantly fainter than the latter ( table  2 shows  fluxes of 3.70 and 0.74  10@xmath20  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath22 for syst-1 and 2 , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , and as far as we know for the first time in an extragalactic syst , we tentatively identified the ne  vii @xmath10973 at 4881  raman - scattered line in the spectrum of syst-2 .",
    "this feature can be clearly seen in the inset of the middle panel of figure 2 ( and in table  2 ) .",
    "however , also considering the fact that in the present case only  is present , with no sign of the  raman scattered line ( both were found at the same epoch in v1016 ; lee et al .",
    "2014 ) , the emission line at 4881  could as well be a n  iii line . in this case the line at @xmath104898 , also present in the spectrum and for which we could not easily find an identification , might be associated with n  iii too . considering the low - resolution of the present spectrum ,",
    "the other lines from the n  iii multiplet are blended with , further complicating a strong identification as n  iii . and , a third possible identification for the 4881  emission - line would be [ fe  iii ] .",
    "altogether the latter arguments imply that the other possible identifications ( n  iii and [ fe  iii ] ) are at least equally possible as ne  vii @xmath10973 at 4881  raman - scattered line . *",
    "205  syst3 was discovered because of the clear presence of a cool stellar continuum in the red part of its spectrum , compatible with that of a m giant .",
    "this symbiotic star , as well as the one discovered in the lg dwarf irregular galaxy ic10 ( gonalves et al .",
    "2008 ) , though not showing the raman scattered lines , shares some other properties of galactic sources .",
    "the latter includes the moderate to high - ionization [ fe  v ] line , at 4181  ( see , for instance , gutierrez - moreno & moreno 1996 ) .",
    "these two conspicuous properties of systs lead us to conclude that syst-3 is , likely , a symbiotic system .",

    "compositions of the blue plus red portions of the gmos spectra of ngc  205 symbiotics are shown in figure  2 , where the main properties that make of them symbiotic systems are highlighted .",
    "we have determined the above discussed extinction coefficient , and corrected all the measured fluxes for further analysis , despite the fact that the balmer line ratios in many symbiotic nebulae indicate self - absorption effects ( due to high densities ) . in those circumstances , the standard methods to estimate reddening would not apply ( possibly the case in syst2 and 3 ) . though most of the line ratios that would provide electron temperatures and densities comes to be out of the sensitive range ( see osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) , the sulphur doublet  @xmath246716 , 6731 allowed us to estimate an electron density of 6,000  @xmath25 for syst1 ( since the -temperature sensitive ratio is below the lower limit , for the above calculation we adopted = 21,000  k ) .",
    "the density sensitive lines were not measured in the remaining cases .",

    "however , limits to the spectral types based on the red part of the optical spectrum of symbiotic stars are possible ( kenyon & fernndez - castro 1987 ) .",
    "the latter authors , using their own data as well as the literature , pointed out that :    * there is no evidence for measurable tio absorption in stars earlier than the spectral type k4 ; * tio indices increase monotonically with spectral type from k4 to m6 ; * vo bands , like the one at 7865 , appear only in giants cooler than @xmath5m5 ; * the amount of vo absorption is negligible for stars earlier than m4 , but rises rapidly for m4-m7 .",
    "taking all these limits into account , and the spectra we show in figure  3 ( on which neither the 7865 , nor any other vo features are present ) , it is clear that the stars there represented have spectral types from k4 to m4 . in order to avoid the tricky task of defining a common continuum , below which the tio absorption indices could be measured ( kenyon & fernndez - castro 1987 )",
    ", we refer the reader to kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , who provide an extensive spectral catalogue for late - type stars from classes k5-m9 , covering the wavelengths from 6900 to 9000 .",
    "this region encompasses tio and vo bands key bands to classify early and late m stars .",
    "table  5 and figure  5 of their paper give the features found in late - k to late - m red spectra , and provide us with a more accurate range of spectral classes for the cool stars of ngc  205 syst1 and syst3 , as being k5 to m2 red giant ( see kirkpatrick s fig .",
    "5a and 5b against our figure  3 ) . to perform this classification ,",
    "our gmos spectra had their spectral resolution smoothed to  18   per pixel , in order to better compare to kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1991 ) catalogue . to close this analysis",
    ", we remember that the  of k and m stars ranges , roughly , from 3,700 to 5,200  k and from 2,400 to 3,700  k , respectively .          due to the extragalactic location of the stars , resolved photometric information is only available from selected telescope - instrument combinations , producing small psfs over pixels of an appropriate scale .",
    "neither optical nor ir counterparts had been found for syst-2 and syst-3 , probably because they are significantly much fainter than syst-1 ( the f@xmath17 of these two sources are @xmath67 and @xmath63 times lower than in syst-1 ) .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of syst-1 has been constructed with available information from the optical and ir spectral ranges .",
    "in addition to our optical  image of syst-1 , presented in section  2 , the object has been unambiguously detected by hst - wfpc2 and spitzer - irac .",
    "all images have been retrieved from public archives , those from the hst come from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , while those from spitzer - irac have been obtained from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) .",
    "the hst - wfpc2 images , with detections in four filters ( f255w , f336w , f555w and f675w ) have a 0.0996/pixel scale , with a psf of typically 2 pixels fwhm .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out by ourselves using the iraf package apphot and converted into flux density .",
    "the ir images from spitzer - irac provide object detections in the four irac ( infrared array camera ) wavelengths ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8@xmath28 m ) .",
    "the spitzer - irac pixel size is 12 /pixel and the typical fwhm of the irac-1 psf is 2.7 pixels .",
    "the ir photometric values for the flux density are taken directly from the spitzer - irac pipeline .",
    "we have carefully checked that the lack of detection of the syst-1 in several popular surveys as , sdss , 2mass , wise is simply due to insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "the final sed has been constructed with six points from both the hst - wfpc2 ( 2 ) and spitzer - irac ( 4 ) . the sed points corresponding to filters hst - f255w and f336w have been excluded .",
    "although visually discernible , their photometric signal to noise is too low ( @xmath6 2 ) .",
    "flux values have been corrected for galactic extinction , which according to schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) amounts to a@xmath29=0.170 mag .",
    "in addition to galactic extinction , internal dust attenuation in the syst-1 has an extinction constant = 0.45 ( see section 2.1 ) , calculated via the balmer decrement . assuming a r@xmath29=3.1 extinction law",
    ", we deduce an a@xmath29=0.955 mag , also used to correct the observed sed values for reddening .",
    "model fitting has been carried out with the vospec tool from the esac virtual observatory project .",
    "in addition to the crude black body fitting , which gives t@xmath12 = 2,455  k , we have fitted cool - star nextgen models ( hauschildt et al .",
    "1999 ) , which produce best fitting for t@xmath12 = 2,800  k. we must emphasize that though the agreement of the latter effective temperatures with the m red giant classification we obtained in section  3.2 is very good fittings are just indicative , because the hst optical sed points are probably overestimations of the continuum , as they include intense emission lines in their passbands , 5007 in the f555w and h@xmath0 in the f675w .",
    "gutierrez - moreno et al . ( 1995 ) demonstrated that syst can be separated from pne in 4363/  vs. 5007/  diagram , being this separation mainly due to difference in physical conditions of the two kind of objects , especially the significantly lower density in pne .",
    "the same is true for all the 35 recently discovered systs in m31 ( see fig .",
    "5 in mikolajewska et al . , 2014 ) .    in figure  5",
    "we place in the gutierrez - moreno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) diagram all the syst of the lg dwarf galaxies , for which the emission - line ratios are available .",
    "most of them are indeed located in the loci of the systs as studied by gutierrez - moreno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in the galaxy , and by mikolajewska et al .",
    "( 2014 ) in m31 . from this figure",
    "it is clear that our syst-1 is a true symbiotic system , and , at a first glance , the other two objects would be discarded as such .",
    "however it is important to note that another symbiotic discovered in ic10 , a lg dwarf irregular galaxy ( gonalves et al .",
    "2008 ) , is also misplaced in this diagram . in the case of the ic10 syst-1 , alike syst-2 and 3 of ngc  205 , neither highly ionized emission - lines nor raman scattered lines are found in the spectrum .",
    "the basis for the classification of the ic10 syst-1 was the extreme similarity of its red spectrum with that of a well - known galactic symbiotic , hen  2 - 147 ( munari and zwitter 2002 ) , on which the cool companion features are clearly present .",
    "we also searched in the literature the emission - line ratios of hen  2 - 147 to properly place it in the gutierrez - moreno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) diagnostic diagram .",
    "unfortunately , these ratios were not available in the literature .",
    "thus , we used the munari and zwitter ( 2002 ) online spectrum of the system to roughly estimate the ratios . the result",
    "( 4363/  1.5 and 5007/  12 - 15 ) again moves this galactic syst in the loci of pne , more exactly in the regime of young pne . because of their high densities , young pne and systs occupy the same region in this diagram , as pointed out by gutierrez - moreno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and pereira & miranda ( 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , what we show in fig .",
    "5 is that our syst-2 as well as the known galactic syst hen  2 - 147 occupy the young pn region of the diagram , whereas our syst-3 and the known syst-1 of ic10 are placed in the region of the evolved pne .",
    "altogether this seems to indicate that not only 2 of the ( possible and likely ) systs in ngc  205 , but also other known systs are misplaced in this diagram , probably due to other effects than the density .",
    "gutierrez - moreno et al . ( 1995 ) also pointed out the fact that very young pne and d - type systs are sometimes impossible to be separated in their diagram .    noting that the milky way has similar metallicity as m31 ( mikolajewska et al .",
    "2014 ) , and that most of the systs of these two spiral galaxies are placed in similar regions of the gutierrez - moreno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) diagnostic diagram , we also investigate the possible metallicity effects in the diagram .",
    "we did so by placing on it the systs of the lower - metallicity lg dwarf galaxies .",
    "5 shows that , even at the lower metallicities of the lg dwarf galaxies , this effect is insufficient to significantly change the loci of pne and systs in the diagram .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning the fact that , at variance with most of the syst candidates that were identified as so via h@xmath0 narrow - band imaging and then their spectra were taken to confirm the classification of the objects in the present paper the narrow - band images were centred on the  5007 filter .",
    "this is probably why our systs are much brighter in  than the majority of the known systs .",
    "in this letter , we report the discovery of the first three true , likely and possible systs of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy ngc  205 . photometric and spectroscopic data of these objects",
    "were obtained with the gemini multi ",
    "object spectrograph ( gmos ) , installed on the gemini north 8.1m telescope . among the detection of several  line emitters in the ngc  205 , three objects were identified as systs .    the classification of these sources as systs was done based on the identification of the raman scattering o  vi lines around @xmath246830,7088  and ne  vii of 4881  ( syst-1 & syst-2 ) , the direct observation of the red continuum of the cool companion ( syst-1 & syst-3 ) , the extremely high intensity of the he ii 4846  recombination line ( syst-1 , syst-2 & syst-3 ) , and the presence of moderate to high - ionization forbidden lines ( for instance  and ) , in syst-1 and 3 .",
    "if confirmed as a true symbiotic binary , syst-2 will be the second known symbiotic star ( and the first extragalactic one ) that shows the ne  vii raman scattering line at 4881 .",
    "the effective temperature of the hot companions were estimated @xmath13340,000  k for syst-1 and syst-2 and @xmath6270,000  k for syst-3 .",
    "these extremely high temperatures are consistent with the detection of high excitation emission lines in the spectra of syst-1 and 3 ( e.g o  vi , [ fe  vii ] , ne  vii ) .",
    "being the faintest of the three systems here studied , syst-2 is an exception in having  as its highest ionization forbidden line .    by examining the red continuum spectra of the cool companions",
    ", they were classified as k5 to m2 red giants .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the classification of the cool companion in syst-1 as a m2 iii is consistent with a cool  star nextgen stellar atmospheric model of t@xmath12 = 2,800  k. this kind of analysis as well as the classification of the cool companion is , unfortunately , not feasible for syst-2 .",
    "we discuss the location of the newly discovered systems in the gutierrez - moreno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) diagram , meant to separate systs from pne in 4363/  vs. 5007/  plane . from their location in this diagnostic diagram , only syst-1 would be a true symbiotic system .",
    "our syst-2 as well as the known galactic syst hen  2 - 147 occupy the young pn region of this diagram , whereas our syst-3 and the known syst-1 of ic10 are placed in the region of the evolved pne .",
    "altogether this seems to indicate that not only 2 of the ( possible and likely ) systs in ngc  205 but also other known systs are misplaced in this diagram , probably because of the interplay of other effects than the physical conditions of the two kinds of nebulae .",
    "gutierrez - moreno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also pointed out the fact that very young pne and d - type systs are sometimes impossible to be separated in their diagram .",
    "we finally note that though the different metallicities of the spirals ( milky way and m31 ) versus the dwarf galaxies of the lg might play a role in the diagram , the use of available data indicates that this effect does not appear to be strong enough to significantly change the location of systs and pne in the gutierrez - moreno et al .",
