    "the electric field drops almost linearly along the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) ( @xmath127 ) the formation of a high electric field domain in the last barrier is clearly observed , favouring a resonant condition between the third well and the collector first - excited subband .",
    "@xcite the second branch in the ndc region ( @xmath128 ) involves the generation of a larger high field domain ( see fig .  [ fig8](c ) ) .",
    "the domain wall is now located in the magnetic well . a jump to the first well ( fig .  [",
    "fig8](d))(@xmath129 ) is accompanied by further expansion of the high field domain . in this situation",
    "all tunneling within the wells takes place between the ground and the excited states , followed by a rapid relaxation to the first subband .",
    "[ fig9 ] illustrates spin - populations near @xmath12@xmath13 features where the spin - dependent element introduced by the magnetic quantum well plays a qualitative role .",
    "[ fig9](a ) describes the position of energy levels for the voltage @xmath130 marked in fig .",
    "the subband energies in the non - magnetic wells ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) are quasidegenerate .",
    "notice that resonant tunneling occurs between @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "further increase of the voltage , however , results in a decrease of the current since now @xmath135 is then off - resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) ) .",
    "the current is then increased again since @xmath136 starts to match @xmath137 .",
    "this explains why @xmath123 does not show the behavior observed for smaller @xmath68 ( @xmath68=3 mev ) in the linear regime .",

    "@xmath123 starts to increase only when @xmath13 is such that @xmath133 reaches within @xmath42 of @xmath137 .",
    "the splitting of the branch at higher bias voltage where all transport occurs via intersubband ( @xmath124 ) resonant tunneling has a similar explanation .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig9](c ) is stabilized by alignment of @xmath133 with @xmath138 levels .",
    "subband mismatch at higher bias gives rise to a sharp reduction of the current , which increases later , as the voltage is increased and resonant tunneling between @xmath136 and @xmath139 levels is achieved .",
    "incidentally , the dips in @xmath123 illustrated in fig .  [ fig5 ] can be explained in this way .",
    "when the latter alignment occurs , a large flow of down - spin carriers streams towards the magnetic well , causing a sharp decrease of the polarization .",
    "the remaining features in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] can be understood in similar terms .",
    "so far all results were calculated by sweeping voltages up .",
    "steady state solutions in the ndc bias voltage region are in general multistable .",
    "we can obtain different solutions at a given bias voltage by evolving solutions following different histories ,  @xcite for example by decreasing voltages from a high initial bias .",
    "for a given voltage different values of the current with different density and spin polarization profiles may be achieved . to amplify effects ,",
    "in studying this possibility , we have set @xmath106  ns in a @xmath140 superlattice .",
    "the change in @xmath123 with voltage is now so greatly increased ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) that even _ reversed _ polarization can be observed at somewhat larger values of @xmath67 in the @xmath124 resonant tunneling regime ( not shown here ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the emergence of dominant spin bottlenecks.@xcite the alterations in polarization are more visible for voltages greater than the one corresponding to the @xmath124 resonance , but we choose not to show them here since these involve transitions to higher excited energy levels , close to the top of the barrier , where our model breaks down .",
    "however , for sufficently high barriers it would be natural to obtain such behavior .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows three different values of spin polarization in the magnetic well which can be obtained at a particular bias voltage , depending on the sample history , up sweep from zero voltage , down sweep from a high voltage , and up sweep to an intermediate voltage followed by down sweep .",
    "we emphasize that this kind of hysteretic phenomena between magnetic states is driven here by _",
    "electric _ fields .",
    "we have introduced and studied a simple model for growth direction non - linear transport in multiple quantum well systems containing magnetically doped layers .",
    "our analysis is based on a tunneling hamiltonian expression for the current between spin - polarized quantum wells and on a phenomenological expression for spin - relaxation within quantum wells .",
    "numerical studies of this model show that it predicts rich behavior due to its non - linearity and due to the additional degrees of freedom introduced by spin - dependent transport .",
    "nonlinearity manifests itself in the formation of electric field domains when the differential conductivity between neighboring layers is negative .",
    "we find that the spin polarization of electrons in magnetic wells can change substantially when the system jumps between different branches of the @xmath12@xmath13 curve .",
    "when current flows finite electron spin - polarization extends from the magnetic quantum wells to non - magnetic quantum wells .",
    "when large equilibrium spin splitting , the @xmath12@xmath13 curve is strongly affected by the appearance of extra branches , due to tunneling into and out of spin polarized well subbands and these effects become more and more prominent when the characteristic time for spin - relaxation is longer .",
    "the effects addressed in this paper could be investigated experimentally by studying transport properties and by studying the polarization dependence of inter - band optical absorption and photoluminescence in mqw systems containing magnetically doped layers .",
    "the predicted sensitivity of transport properties to external magnetic fields , suggests that these systems could potentially be useful for magnetic field sensors , most likely in geometries with a relatively small number of quantum wells .",
    "the sensitivity to external fields will be strongest at low temperatures where the the mn ions are easily polarized to produce the maximum equilibrium spin - splitting field . to illustrate the sort of effects that we expect to occur , we have considered only relatively simple geometries with a single magnetic layer .",
    "other effects will occur in larger mqw systems with particular geometries .",
    "in general there is considerable lattitude for designing the mn density distribution in the mqw system to realize desired magnetoresistance effects that could be described with the type of model we have introduced here .",
    "analogs of the magnetotransport effects we discuss will also occur in ferromagnetic multiple quantum well systems , similar to the delta - doped layered ( ga , mn)as systems studied by kawakami _ et al . _",
    "@xcite these systems are ferromagnetic and the carriers are holes rather than electrons , leading to strain - sensitive spin - orbit - coupling induced magnetic anisotropy@xcite and coercitivities .",
    "these properties suggest a rich interplay between the hysteretic magnetoresistance effects common in thin film itinerant electron magnets@xcite and the hysteretic effects discussed here , which have their roots in electric field domain structures.@xcite had ferromagnetism been taken into account in our model calculations , by solving for @xmath68 self - consistenly in eq .",
    "( [ eq - delta ] ) , not only the electric field domain structure but also the magnetic state configuration would have been sensitive to the bias voltage history . exploring these possibilities",
