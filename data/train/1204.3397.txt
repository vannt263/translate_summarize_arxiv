    "when a quantum system is prepared in an initial state @xmath0 and then freely evolves , the expectation value of an observable @xmath1 is calculated as @xmath2 .",
    "when , however , the system is prepared in @xmath0 but postselected to be in a final state @xmath3 , the expectation value of the observable @xmath1 is not given by @xmath4 but @xmath5 which is referred to as `` weak value '' and was first introduced by aharonov , albert and vaidman in 1988 @xcite .",
    "they also proposed how to experimentally obtain the weak value using weak measurement .",
    "weak measurement gives us a protocol to perform measurement without disturbance on a time evolution of a measured system .",
    "the readout of such a measuring device ( pointer ) is noisy and gives us little information in a single run . by averaging over many runs , however",
    ", we can correctly estimate the expectation value of measured observable , @xmath6 , for the system in @xmath0 .",
    "especially , when the system is finally found in @xmath3 ( postselection ) , in the limit of no disturbance , the pointer shows the real part of the weak value , ( [ eq : wvdef ] ) .",
    "weak measurement provides an experimentally accessible manner to treat fundamental issues like quantum paradoxes @xcite-@xcite , and the applications for high sensitive measurement have been also reported @xcite-@xcite . using the weak value , we may consider a value of a physical quantity in the middle of a time evolution as in the case of classical physics .",
    "indeed , trajectories for an ensemble of quantum particles were recently observed via weak measurement @xcite .",
    "a wave function can be also directly observed as reported in @xcite . as shown in equation ( [ eq : wvdef ] ) ,",
    "a weak value may take a strange value lying outside the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "hardy s paradox is a good example , in which we fall into a paradox when we consider which path a quantum particle takes .",
    "weak measurement actually results in the paradoxical values , and , at the same time , shows a strange weak value -1 for a projector unlike a probability @xcite .",
    "clarifying the condition for such a strange weak value may give us a clue to understand the significance of a weak value @xcite .",
    "especially , it is notable that the correspondence of a strange weak value to a violation of leggett - garg inequality was pointed out @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as we have seen , a weak value , defined by equation ( [ eq : wvdef ] ) , come from weak measurement originally : a weak value is widely accepted as a result of measurement in trying to carry out measurement without disturbance , although it is often argued whether such a trial always results in the weak value @xcite .",
    "the measurability has been certainly crucial to emphasize the significance of the weak value more than just a by - product from calculation .",
    "however , a weak value , by itself , must be helpful for understanding or explaining a physical phenomenon in quantum mechanics , if the value is legitimate as a physical quantity .",
    "in other words , weak measurement is a mere tool for extracting out a weak value .",
    "then , it should be asked whether the weak value can be found in quantum process irrespective of weak measurement and can act as a value of a physical quantity .    in this paper , motivated by this question",
    ", we pick up spontaneous pair productions via a supercritical step potential , in which a weak value of a group velocity gives us a quantitative explanation . in our case ,",
    "the weak value is introduced without measurement .",

    "now , let us verify that this weak value formalism gives us a reasonable explanation for the spontaneous pair production . in discussing a spending time for a tunneling particle in a barrier region ,",
    "a problem often begins with how to define such a time in quantum mechanics . describing the time evolution with a weak value",

    "it is similar to our discussion in section [ sec : w_d ] @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . with a weak value",
    ", we can try to treat a value of a physical quantity in effect like classical mechanics .    in our case , what to discuss is whether we can work it out by thinking of an incident particle passing the region @xmath109 with the velocity @xmath119 and the spending time @xmath22 as if it were a classical particle . in the region @xmath109 ,",
    "the force @xmath120 acts on a particle for time @xmath22 , by which the momentum of the particle is changed as follows , @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the momentum after the impulse",
    ". stated differently , we can find @xmath123 if @xmath22 represents the spending time in the region @xmath109 , equation ( [ eq : vel_mo ] ) shows the average velocity in the region @xmath109 . when the final momentum @xmath122 is @xmath124 , equation ( [ eq : vel_mo ] ) is identical to the velocity @xmath119 .",

    "due to @xmath127 for the step potential , @xmath22 should finally satisfy @xmath128 to converge the value ( [ eq : vel_mo ] ) , which makes the assumption that @xmath22 is very small in deriving equation ( [ eq : wvtrans ] ) appropriate . for the exponential approximation in equation ( [ eq : appe_wv0 ] ) due to @xmath129 .",

    "they also pointed out the significance of a weak value beyond its detectability . in our case ,",
    "due to the simple setup , we could find that a weak value can evidently be a value of a physical quantity : we have shown an assured case in which a weak value is undoubtedly more than just a mathematical by - product .",
    "our case allows us to treat a quantum particle like a classical particle with a group velocity given by a weak value .",
    "in addition , it has been revealed that the appearance of a strange weak value can be linked to a physical phenomenon , namely , a pair production .",
    "we can find some recent works on superluminal velocity in the context of a weak value @xcite . at a glance",
    ", one may doubt considering superlumial velocity , even if it satisfies causality . briefly speaking",
    ", such a strange weak value comes from quantum interference .",
    "as we have mentioned , however , it should not be easily concluded that a weak value is just a by - product from calculation .",
    "although we have emphasized the significance of a weak value irrespective of weak measurement , from the starting point of view , it is surely important that a weak value can be experimentally obtained by measurement .",
    "recently , weak measurement attracts attention as a tool for measurement of a quantum state without destroying it @xcite .",
    "then , it may be an interesting question whether we should treat a quantum state as an substantial being : can a wave function be beyond a calculation tool ?",
    "our result supports the usefulness of a weak value as an actual value of a physical quantity , over and above just a result of weak measurement .",
