    "since the pioneering work of anderson  @xcite , the disorder - induced localization in electronic systems has been the subject of intense research activities for more than four decades . according to the scaling theory proposed by abrahams et al .",
    "@xcite , all electronic states in one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) disordered systems are localized irrespective of the degree of the randomness , and in 3d systems there exist the metal - insulator transitions .",
    "the prediction of the scaling theory for 1d systems is in agreement with the exact results  @xcite , and the existence of anderson localization in 3d systems is widely accepted  @xcite .",
    "the dimension 2 is the marginal dimension in the problem of anderson localization .",
    "it is believed that in generic situations , there exist no true metallic states in 2d disordered noninteracting systems at zero temperature .",
    "however , some exceptions have been known to this rule .",
    "for example , non - localized states were found at the band center of a 2d anderson model with purely off - diagonal disorder  [ 6 - 10 ] .",
    "the metal - insulator transition is also recently shown to occur in a disordered 2d square lattice model with long - range power - law transfer terms  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the disorder effects in 2d noninteracting electron systems deserve further investigation .    in the scaling theory of localization",
    ", the perturbative approach is exploited to study the weak - disorder limit , revealing the weak - localization effect in 2d electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the weak - localization theory describes the quantum interference ( qi ) effect that results from constructive interference between the closed electron paths and their time - reversal counterparts , which can be represented by the maximally - crossed diagrams in the diagrammatic approach .",
    "while the qi effect contributes no singular correction to the electronic density of states ( dos ) , the qi correction to the dc conductivity of a 2d system is shown to be  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote , respectively , the elastic and inelastic scattering rates , and @xmath5 with @xmath6 the diffusion coefficient and @xmath7 the sample size . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the inelastic scattering has a dephasing effect on the qi process .",
    "equation ( 1.1 ) indicates that the dc conductivity is a monotonic function of the temperature or the sample size , as the inelastic scattering rate @xmath4 decreases with decreasing the temperature .",
    "equation ( 1.1 ) is usually obtained by means of the free - electron model within the born approximation , in which only the twofold scattering process from the same impurity is concerned . however , for a 2d crystal with half - filled band , there usually exist the particle - hole symmetry of electronic spectrum , as well as the van hove singularity in the dos at the fermi level .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry has been recently shown to play an important role on the qi effect of the quasiparticles in 2d disordered @xmath8-wave superconductors  @xcite , as well as on the disorder effects in 2d mott - hubbard insulators  @xcite .",
    "the large value of the dos at the fermi level can drive a disordered system into the unitary limit  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to investigate the effects of the particle - hole symmetry and van hove singularity on the qi process in disordered 2d crystals . while both the born and unitary limits have been widely investigated in the disordered @xmath8-wave superconductors , the qi effect in the unitary limit did not receive enough attention in the study of disordered normal metals .    in the previous short report  @xcite",
    ", we have studied the qi effect at zero temperature in disordered 2d crystals with exactly half - filled bands .",
    "we pointed out that it is necessary to treat the impurity scattering within the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximation ( sctma ) due to the existence of the van hove singularity at the fermi level .",
    "the sctma approach takes into account the effect of multiple - scattering events from the same impurity , and thus gives naturally the results of the born and the unitary approximations in two distinct limits .",
    "in addition to the usual 0-mode cooperon and diffuson , there exist the @xmath1-mode cooperon and diffuson in the unitary limit due to the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "these diffusive @xmath1-modes were found to introduce some new conductivity diagrams , and the resulting qi correction to the conductivity in the unitary limit was shown to increase with the square of the sample size , suggesting the existence of the extended states at the band center .",
    "the aim of this work is to study further the situation of deviation from exact half - filling , and investigate the dephasing effect on the qi process at finite temperatures .",
    "much details of the derivations omitted in ref .",
    "[ 18 ] is also presented in this paper .",
    "contrary to the 0-mode cooperon and diffuson , the diffusive @xmath1-modes are found to be gapped by the deviation from the exactly - nested fermi surface .",
    "the conductivity diagrams with these gapped diffusive @xmath1-modes give rise to unexpected features of the qi effect .",
    "in addition to the inelastic scattering , the thermal fluctuation is shown to be also an important dephasing mechanism in the qi processes related with the diffusive @xmath1-modes . upon approaching to the nested fermi surface ,",
    "the conductivity is subject to a power - law anti - localization correction induced by the @xmath1-mode diffuson . for large deviation from the nesting case ,",
    "the contributions of the diffusive @xmath1-modes are suppressed , and the usual logarithmic weak - localization effect remains due to the 0-mode cooperon .",
    "consequently , the qi correction to the conductivity in the unitary limit has a non - monotonic behavior with increasing the temperature or the sample size .",
    "this result is strikingly different from the prediction of the usual weak - localization theory .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the sctma scenario is described in details for a disordered 2d crystal with nearly half - filled band , and the conditions for the born and unitary limits are presented .",

    "iii for the nearly - nested fermi surface . in sec .",
    "iv , we evaluate the electric current - current correlation function responsible for the qi effect , and then calculate the qi correction to dc conductivity in the unitary limit .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "v. in appendix a , we prove some mathematical formulas , which are useful in the evaluations of the previous sections .",
    "appendix b is presented to show that the electric current - current correlation function in the retarded - retarded ( rr ) channel has a vanishing qi correction to the dc conductivity .",
    "we start with the tight - binding model for a square lattice , of which the electrical spectrum is described by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lattice constant , @xmath11 is the nearest - neighbor hopping integral , and @xmath12 is the chemical potential .",
    "a half - filled band ( @xmath13 ) is characteristic of a perfectly - nested fermi surface , which is composed of four straight lines ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) in the momentum space .",
    "the electronic velocity @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 here we take @xmath18 . the dos per spin of the clean crystal , defined by @xmath19 , is shown to be of a logarithmic van hove singularity at the center of the band , i.e. , @xmath20    in the presence of dilute point - like nonmagnetic impurities randomly substituted for the host atoms , the electronic self - energy can be adequately expressed in the sctma as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the impurity concentration , @xmath3 is the elastic scattering rate , @xmath23 is a dimensional parameter , and @xmath24 represents the shift of the chemical potential that can be absorbed in @xmath12 .",
    "a use of dyson s equation immediately yields the impurity - averaged one - particle green s functions as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , with @xmath4 the additional inelastic scattering rate induced by , e.g. , the electron - electron and/or electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the intent of the introduction of @xmath4 is to investigate the dephasing effect on the qi process at finite temperatures that are assumed to be low enough so that @xmath27 .",
    "the dos at the fermi level of this disordered crystal can be readily calculated via @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",

    "the born and unitary approximations turns out to be two natural limits of the sctma , as the latter includes the effect of multiple - scattering process from the same impurity . as shown by eq .",

    "( 2.10 ) , it follows that the unitary condition can be satisfied for a finite impurity potential @xmath33 and a low impurity concentration @xmath22 .",
    "since the qi effect in a disordered electron system results from the cooperon and diffuson , we first derive their expressions for a nearly half - filled band on the basis of the sctma described above .",
    "it is useful to note that the present system has two different kinds of symmetries .",
    "the first is the time - reversal symmetry described by @xmath42 and @xmath43 due to which the cooperon and diffuson have the same expressions .",
