    "the main strategy of dark matter experiments @xcite is based on accumulating large target masses of heavy nuclei ( like xenon ) , keeping low background levels by a systematic radiopurity control of all components and an enhancement of the electron / neutron discrimination methods .",
    "however , some recent positive hints , which may be interpreted in terms of low mass wimps , have changed the detection strategy to sub - kev energies and light gases .",
    "this research line could be led in future experiments by time projection chambers ( tpcs ) , as they can reach energy thresholds @xmath0 100 ev and have access to richer topological information .",
    "in contrast to current gaseous - based experiments , focused on directional dark matter detection @xcite , the trex - dm experiment proposes a strategy based on high gas pressures , even if neutron / electron discrimination could be less effective , but keeping a low energy threshold . trex - dm is a low background micromegas - based tpc for low - mass wimp detection and will profit from all developments made in micromegas technology @xcite , as well as in the selection of radiopure materials @xcite , specially in cast @xcite and next - mm @xcite projects .",
    "its main goal is the operation of an active detection mass @xmath00.3 kg with an energy threshold below 0.4  kevee ( as already observed in @xcite ) .",
    "the actual setup ( fig . [ fig : setup ] ) is composed of a copper vessel , with an inner diameter of 0.5  m , a length of 0.5  m and a wall thickness of 6  cm .",
    "the vessel contains two active volumes ( _ a _ in the design ) , separated by a central copper cathode ( _ b _ ) . at each side",
    "there is a field cage ( _ d _ ) that makes uniform the drift field along the 19  cm between the cathode and the detector .",
    "each bulk micromegas detector ( _ e _ ) @xcite is screwed to a copper base , which is then attached to the vessel s inner walls by means of four columns .",
    "the gas enters the vessel by a feedthrough at the bottom part ( _ h _ ) and comes out by another one at the top part ( _ i _ ) .",
    "the calibration system consists of a plastic tube entering in the bottom part ( _ h _ ) , which allows to calibrate each side at four different points ( _ c _ ) with a @xmath2cd source , emitting x - rays of 22.1 ( k@xmath3 ) and 24.9 kev ( k@xmath4 ) .",
    "the trex - dm prototype is part of the wider scope erc - funded project called trex , that since 2009 is devoted to r&d on low background tpcs and their potential applications in axion , double beta decay and dark matter experiments .",
    "work on the trex - dm prototype started 2012 with the first designs and it is now being commissioned at the trex lab at zaragoza . most of the components have been validated : the leak - tightness of all feedthroughs has been verified for pressures up to 10 bar ; the drift cage has been tested at high voltage ; and all experimental parameters like the pressure , the temperature and voltages are continuously monitored by a slow control . moreover ,",
    "during the first semester of 2015 , some issues have been successfully solved : the noise level has been effectively reduced by a new high voltage filter for the central cathode and a faraday cage for the interface cards ; a new field cage has been installed to reduce border effects ; and a new daq to read both detectors at a rate of 45  hz each side has been installed . during the next months",
    ", the detector will be characterized in ar+2%ic@xmath5h@xmath6 and ar+5%ic@xmath5h@xmath6 , with the aim to detect sub - kev energies at high gas pressures . in parallel , the first designs of a fully radiopure setup are being made , which include a lead shielding and the replacement of some dirty components in terms of radiopurity .",
    "the sensitivity of the experiment has been studied creating a first background model , if it were installed at canfranc underground laboratory ( lsc ) .",
    "we have considered two light gas mixtures at 10 bar : ar+2%ic@xmath5h@xmath6 and ne+2%ic@xmath5h@xmath6 ; with an active mass of 0.3 and 0.16  kg respectively and which are good candidates to detect low mass wimps .",
    "however , the sensitivity of an argon - based mixture may be limited by one of its isotopes ( @xmath7ar ) , which is @xmath8-decay and has a long life - time . in our model , we have considered the lowest content of this isotope , measured in argon extracted from undeground sources @xcite .",
    "we have also simulated the main radioactive isotopes of all the inner components using their measured activities @xcite and the cosmic muon flux in canfranc . in some cases like the micromegas detectors or their connectors , we have considered the activities of their radiopure alternative .",
    "the external gamma flux has not been included as its contribution may be supressed by an external shielding .",
    "h@xmath6 at 10 bar .",
    "the contribution of the different simulated components is also plotted : external muon flux ( red line ) , vessel contamination ( blue line ) , connectors ( magenta line ) , field cage ( green line ) , central cathode ( brown line ) , micromegas detector ( purple line ) and @xmath7ar ( dark blue line ) .",
    "right : wimp parameter space focused on the low - mass range . filled regions represent the values that may explain the hints of positive signals observed in cogent , cdms - si , cresst and dama / libra experiments .",
    "the thick lines are the preliminary sensitivity of trex - dm supossing a 0.4  kevee energy threshold and two different hypothesis on background and exposure : 100 ( solid ) and 1(dashed ) kev@xmath9 kg@xmath9 day@xmath9 , and 1 and 10 kg - year respectively , and for both argon- ( black ) and neon - based mixtures ( green).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] h@xmath6 at 10 bar .",

    "the first one is a modified version of cast @xcite , optimized to discriminate low energy x - rays from complex topologies like gammas and cosmic muons .",
    "it uses two likelihood functions generated by the x - rays cluster features of a calibration source .",
    "fixing a total 80% signal efficiency , the expected background level for an argon- ( neon- ) based mixture gas at 10 bar is @xmath03.1 ( @xmath01.4 ) kev@xmath9 kg@xmath9 day@xmath9 , dominated by the @xmath7ar isotope in the case of argon and by the connectors and the vessel in the case of neon . the contribution of each component is shown in fig . [ fig : backspec ] ( left ) for the argon case . the second analysis is based on the simulation of a @xmath1cf neutron source , which reproduces better wimps signals .",
    "the level obtained in argon is a @xmath044% lower , as nuclear recoils show narrower cluster widths .",
    "suposing a 0.4  kevee energy threshold and former background levels , trex - dm experiment could be sensitive to a relevant fraction of the low - mass wimp parameter space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : backspec ] , right ) including the regions invoked in some interpretations of dama / libra results and other hints of positive wimps signals , with an exposure of 1 kg - year .",
    "the trex - dm is a low background micromegas - based tpc for low - mass wimp detection .",
    "its main goal is the operation of a light gas at high pressure ( active mass @xmath00.3 kg ) with an energy threshold of 0.4  kevee or below and fully built with previously selected radiopure materials .",
    "the detector is being comissioned at trex laboratory and may be installed at the lsc during 2016 for a possible physics run .",
