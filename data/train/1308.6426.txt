    "in this work we analyse the scattering properties of massive scalar particles in strong gravitational fields .",
    "we find the resulting dynamics to be significantly richer and more complex than in the massless scalar case we considered previously  @xcite .",
    "the strong gravitational field is provided by a near - black - hole object , defined as having a radius @xmath0 that slightly exceeds the corresponding schwarzschild radius @xmath1 , and taken to be static and spherically symmetric . as with the massless particle case",
    ", we find the spectrum to be dominated by a set of dense , narrow resonances which give rise to black - hole - like absorption as @xmath2 ( black hole limit ) .",
    "that is , the resonances lifetimes are such that an observer will not live long enough to get the scattered particle back even for elastic processes .",
    "however , this system also possesses bound states , the energies of which are given by the same formula used to describe the resonance positions . having both bound and resonant states",
    ", this system may have radiative transitions between resonant and bound states , which drive inelastic capture .",
    "furthermore , we find that the lifetime ( for elastic processes ) of the resonances for massive incident particles is parametrically larger than the massless case .",
    "we show that this increase in lifetime means the system acquires black - hole - like absorption well before an equivalent system with massless incident particles .    in previous works we found that for massless spin-@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 particles scattering in the field of a near - black - hole object , there exists a dense spectrum of narrow resonances ( long lived meta - stable states ) , the lifetimes and density of which tend to infinity as the body @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the resulting energy average cross - section for capture into these resonances ( optical cross - section ) exactly matched that of a schwarzschild black hole in the low energy limit .",
    "this illustrated that the body may develop black hole absorption properties before the formation of a black hole .",
    "on the other hand , this set of resonances is complemented by an equally dense set of bound states for massive particles , the spectrum of which collapses to zero energy ( and becomes quasi - continuous ) in the black hole limit @xcite .",
    "the requirement that the metric be static and spherically symmetric does not in turn require isotropy of the stress energy tensor , freeing us to explore the parameter space beyond the well known buchdahl limit @xmath7 .",
    "the ability to take @xmath8 for anisotropic spheres has been examined previously ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "two examples of such metrics were developed by florides  @xcite and soffel  @xcite , and are discussed further in later sections .    in this work",
    "we consider the effect of non - zero particle mass on the scattering of scalar particles around finite - size bodies .",
    "we show that a dense spectrum of resonances still exists for massive particles , but with two important differences .",
    "firstly , the width of a given resonance is smaller for a particle with mass @xmath9 and thus the lifetime of the state is longer ( with the resonance position being weakly dependent on @xmath10 ) .",
    "this longer lifetime implies that the transition to black - hole - like absorption occurs much earlier than in the massless case .",
    "secondly , there exists a spectrum of bound states for @xmath11 , ` shifting ' the start of the resonance spectrum to higher energies @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , the structure of the resonance and bound level energies is nearly identical for @xmath13 close to @xmath0 : the energy levels of both bound and unbound states may be described by the same formula . therefore , as @xmath2 ( with fixed particle mass @xmath10 ) any resonance of principal quantum number @xmath14 ( defined as a resonance having @xmath15 nodes on the interior , consistent with the bound spectrum ) will disappear from the unbound spectrum and be replaced by a bound state .    in the unbound case , as @xmath16 , all resonances of a given @xmath14 will eventually cross into the bound state spectrum . however , for a given energy range @xmath17 in the continuum , the resonance energy spacing @xmath18 and width @xmath19 tend to zero ( lifetime @xmath20 ) , while their ratio remains finite .",
    "this allows us to define the total cross - section for particle capture into these long - lived states using the optical model  @xcite , which is calculated by averaging over a small energy interval containing many resonances . in the low momentum limit",
    "the resonance capture cross - section is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the energy of the incident particle and @xmath23 is the particle momentum at infinity .",
    "this is precisely the low momentum absorption cross section for massive scalar particles incident upon a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .    additionally , such a system may have radiative transitions allowing particles to drop down from resonances into bound states .",
    "while we only calculate the resonance spectrum for s - wave ( @xmath24 ) states , all states including those with @xmath25 contribute to the total inelastic width that appears in the formula for the cross section .",
    "we show that so long as the individual partial widths of any inelastic processes are negligible compared to the distance between the levels , only the elastic width contributes to the total energy - averaged capture cross - section given above .    it should be noted that the resonances considered in this work are localised ( in the black hole limit ) entirely on the interior of the finite - size body , and",
    "thus differ from the quasi - bound states that exist in the exterior black hole spacetime ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    as in previous works",
    "we perform both analytical and numerical calculations , with good agreement between the two .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for a scalar particle of mass @xmath10 in curved space - time with the metric @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is @xmath28 one may write the metric of a static , spherically symmetric non - rotating body as @xmath29 substituting eqn .",

    "as we are considering narrow resonances and low energies , @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 is the energy scale in our system of units ) , we make the substitution @xmath94 only in the linear energy terms of ( [ eq : resstart ] ) .",

    "thus black - hole properties may emerge in a non - singular static metric prior to the formation of a black hole as in the @xmath102 case .",
    "additionally , we show that both the resonance and bound state energies may be described by a single function spanning both spectra .",
    "consequently , in the black hole limit any resonance of fixed principal quantum number @xmath14 will disappear and be replaced with a bound state with identical @xmath14 . as shown previously in @xcite , bound states and a similarly dense spectrum of resonances also exist for massless particles in near - singular metrics with no black hole limit .",
    "we therefore conjecture that generalising to @xmath110 particles in such systems would also lead to possible radiative capture , as well as lengthening of resonance lifetimes leading to a more rapid onset of the limiting behaviour .                                                      for @xmath190 the florides metric may represent the gravitational field inside a cluster of particles moving in randomly oriented circular orbits for larger @xmath0 ( einstein cluster ) . in the case where @xmath191 the florides metric does not correspond to any macroscopic object , but nevertheless represents a valid solution to the field equations .",
    "the ` physical reasonableness ' of such a solution is discussed in both n. k. kofinti , gen .",
