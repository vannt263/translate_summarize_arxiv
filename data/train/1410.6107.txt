    "in order to explain the flavor structure of yukawa couplings in the standard model ( sm ) , discrete flavor symmetries have been extensively used . the freedom to choose the yukawa matrix structures has lead model builders to study some particular textures , for instance , the nearest neighbor interaction ( nni ) form ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the fritzsch - like  @xcite and non fritzch - like textures ( see @xcite for an overview of both cases ) and n - zero textures , among others .    in the lepton sector , the matrix which contain the three mixing angles together with a cp violating phase is the lepton mixing matrix @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1 .",
    "it can be parametrized in different ways , one of them is the standard parametrization  @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the dirac cp violating phase .",
    "the most used ansatz for the lepton mixing matrix had been the tribimaximal mixing ( tbm ) matrix  @xcite : @xmath6 which implies a zero value for @xmath7 .",
    "however , after the experimental confirmation of its non - zero value  @xcite , the tbm requires corrections coming possibly from the charged lepton sector .",
    "if we demand @xmath8 to be the matrix which diagonalizes @xmath9 and @xmath10 the one that diagonalizes @xmath11 ( in the weak basis ) , we wanted to determine the form of @xmath12 such that the @xmath0 has values in the allowed experimental range , being @xmath13 and @xmath14 is such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath12 is an arbitrary mass matrix with unknown values @xmath17 in this first approach we considered the particular case of a real mass matrix , then @xmath18 takes the form @xmath19 we were interested in determining the textures with the maximum number of zeros ( having such textures can be useful to model builders ) because zeros may be due to some underlying flavor symmetry .",
    "so , we started looking for all the possible three - zero textures and we found sixteen different matrices ( up to column permutations ) shown in ( [ texturas ] ) . @xmath20",
    "to perform the analysis , we made a scan over the allowed experimental range of the mixing angles taken from @xcite , looking for the mixing angles combinations that provided real solutions to equation ( [ msquare ] ) ( for the charged lepton masses we used the values in @xcite and set @xmath21 values to @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "for textures @xmath24 we did not find any solution . that leave us with ten possible textures .",
    "for each texture of the yukawa matrix , we find the maximum and minimum orders of magnitude of their entries .",
    "we also searched for the solution volume of each three - zero texture ( i.e. the set of points given by the three mixing angles that make possible to find real solutions to the entries of the @xmath12 matrix ) . in nine of the ten cases",
    "the solution volume fills the complete experimentally allowed parameter space .",
    "the most interesting case is that of texture @xmath25 ( with zeroes on the diagonal ) , which give us the solution volume showed in figure [ solvol ] .     for @xmath26 .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath27.,width=226 ]    the main characteristic of this case is that the angle @xmath28 is very restricted .",
    "its allowed interval is [ 0.7763,0.7876 ] for @xmath29 , and [ 0.7750,0.7873 ] for @xmath30 .",
    "these intervals exclude the best fit value of @xmath28 .",
    "we found that there are extra conditions on the entries of @xmath31 ( being @xmath32gev the higgs vev ) in terms of the charged lepton masses : @xmath33 one can hope that these conditions may be due to an internal structure of the mixing matrix @xmath14 . therefore , we considered a ckm - like parametrization for the @xmath14 mixing matrix in terms of three angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 y @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 then , just naming @xmath41 instead of @xmath0 , we find the following relations @xmath42",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 evaluating the above equations in the ranges @xmath45 $ ] , all the points @xmath46 that matched the experimental allowed intervals are shown in figure [ matchmixangles ] .",
    "we obtain a small region given by two small angles and a large one : @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "taking into account the allowed values for @xmath50 , @xmath51 y @xmath52 , we can use a first - order approximation for the respective rotation matrices of @xmath14 @xmath53 where @xmath54 . then , from equations ( [ msquare ] ) and ( [ realml2 ] ) and using the approximation ( [ approx ] ) , we find the following model independent relations : @xmath55 these expressions explain the observations considered before and represent the main result of this analysis .",
    "assuming that the neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by the tbm matrix we tested several zero textures for the charged lepton mass matrix looking for those which provided @xmath0 values in accordance with data . from the analysis we identified ten three - zero textures satisfying our assumptions and delimited the size range of their entries .",
    "one of these textures ( the one with zeros in the diagonal ) exhibited a different and interesting behavior restricting the mixing angle @xmath28 to be located in a small range to agree with data . proposing a ckm - like parametrization of the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath14 , we obtained some texture - independent relations in terms of the three rotation angles in @xmath14 and the charged lepton masses .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the case of real charged lepton mass matrices and fixed the lepton cp violating phase , but a model independent analysis considering the lepton sector cp violating dirac phase was later realized in @xcite .",
