    "the most massive galaxies known have stellar masses @xmath0 m@xmath1 , and the fact that they already exist at early epochs @xcite implies that they must have formed rapidly @xcite , during just a few giga - years .",
    "they are expected to host supermassive black holes @xcite which have periods of active accretion @xcite .",
    "a symbiotic occurrence of modest star - formation and accretion activity has been inferred in the high mass host galaxies of intermediate redshift x - ray selected agn @xcite .",
    "additional interest for details of the symbiosis in radio - loud agn is moreover generated by the proposed negative agn feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we quantitatively address star - formation and black hole build - up in the most massive galaxies hosting radio - loud agn , during their time of formation .",
    "powerful high - redshift radio galaxies are ideal tracers of the extreme form of starburst - agn symbiosis for several reasons .",
    "firstly , their central black holes are being fed at a high rate , hence are rapidly growing .",
    "secondly , their large extended radio sources allow an unambiguous quantification of the accretion power , from the huge radio luminosities ; moreover , their radio morphological properties permit an estimate of the duration of the agn and possibly coeval star - formation episodes .",
    "thirdly , the presence of large reservoirs of molecular gas , the necessary fuel for star - formation , has been inferred @xcite from ( sub)-millimetre spectroscopy in some radio galaxies ( but not in all ) .",
    "quantification of the ongoing star - formation is provided through far - infrared ( fir ) observations , since dust absorbs the radiation of the young stars and re - emits it at fir wavelengths . from rest - frame submillimetre photometry @xcite and mid - infrared spectral energy distributions , seds @xcite it was suspected that some powerful high redshift radio galaxies might be experiencing phases of copious ( dust obscured ) star - formation .",
    "the implications from the sed measurements , however , were uncertain : the amount of cool dust reradiating the emission of the newly formed stars was not well constrained , as the rest - frame far - infrared regions and the rayleigh - jeans tails lack data .",
    "the herschel space observatory @xcite provides full measurement of ir - submm seds at unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "this letter presents breakthrough results on a sample of seventy radio - loud , high - redshift agn , namely quasars and radio galaxies from the 3c and 4c catalogues . with p@xmath2 w hz@xmath3 ,",
    "these agn contain the most powerful accreting black holes .",
    "inspection of our sample measurements shows fir detection fractions of roughly two in three objects , at both 160  and 250  ( from the herschel pacs and spire instruments , respectively ) . stressing that the non - detected objects are probably just below the sensitivity limit , we focus here on three archetypal objects , reporting on their spectacular on - going star - formation .",
    "3c368 @xcite , 3c68.2 @xcite and 3c257 @xcite , at redshifts @xmath4 = 1.132 , 1.575 , and 2.474 respectively , are archetypal protogalaxies with well - documented properties .",
    "3c257 is the highest redshift object in the complete 3cr sample @xcite .",
    "the first studies of 3c68.2 and 3c368 in the mid and late 1980s , and their identification as protogalaxies marked the birth of the k@xmath4-diagram @xcite and the beginning of extensive observations of their massive hosts in a cosmological context @xcite . the presence of a luminous qso  a type-1 agn , obscured from direct view behind a toroidal circumnuclear dust configuration  was proven in the case of 3c257 from x - ray data @xcite ; similarly the two other objects reveal obscured qsos , in our as yet unpublished chandra data .",
    "photometric observations of 3c368 , 3c68.2 and 3c257 were carried out as part of a herschel guaranteed time program  see table  1 .",
    "the pacs scan - map mode was employed with cross scans in the blue ( 70 ) and the red ( 160 ) bands , yielding angular resolution of respectively 5  and 11 .",
    "data reduction was performed within hipe @xcite following standard procedures for deep field observations , including source masking and high - pass filtering .",
    "both scan directions were processed individually and then mosaiced to yield the final map .",
    "aperture photometry ( including appropriate aperture corrections ) of the sources at the known radio core positions was carried out to measure source flux densities .",
    "photometric uncertainties were determined by measuring the flux in several apertures on empty parts of the background .",
    "the spire small map mode was employed in the 250@xmath5 m ( 18  resolution ) , 350@xmath5 m ( 25 ) and 500@xmath5 m ( 36 ) bands .",
    "data processing followed standard procedures for small map data within hipe .",
    "the photometry was performed utilizing a spire source extractor also implemented in hipe @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the spire photometry are dominated by confusion noise . combining the herschel data with our existing @xcite spitzer mid - infrared photometry",
    ", we were able to trace our science targets as well as other objects in the fields over two decades in wavelength . with this approach",
    "we ensure proper identifications while avoiding source confusion . supplementing our herschel and spitzer data with published photometry",
    "we obtain the complete optical - ir - submm seds . to extract physical parameters , we fitted the data with three components representing typical constituents of a radio galaxy sed . in practice , we started with the agn - powered warm dust emission by cycling through a library of torus models covering a wide range in the relevant parameter space @xcite .",
    "for each torus model ( using edge - on inclinations of 60 , 75 , or 90 ) we added a black body in the optical - nir for emission from the host galaxy stars1300k . such a component , which is generally identified with hot dust close to the sublimation temperature , is often observed in type-1 agn but has not been seen in type-2s so far .",
    "inclusion or exclusion of this hot dust component does not affect the forthcoming conclusions .",
    "] as well as a modified black body of variable temperature ( grey - body model with @xmath6 fixed at 1.6 ) in the fir / submm to account for possible excess emission due to star - formation .",
    "figure  1 shows for each source the combination of one of the torus models , scaling for all components , and fir dust temperature which overall minimizes the chi - square , i.e. , the best fitting model .",
    "errors on the derived physical parameters were determined from the distribution of these parameter values for the range of model combinations consistent with the data .",
    "since radio galaxy jets have large inclinations , radio core emission is relativistically de - boosted rather than boosted as in quasars .",
    "core radio data @xcite indeed show that any non - thermal contribution to the submm emission is negligible . while the spire beam also encloses the radio source hot spots , their contribution is negligible since even the total integrated radio sed underpredicts the fir / submm by a large margin .",
    "as figure  1 shows , substantial cool dust emission is called for by the sed grey bodies , with temperatures of 53k , 36k and 37k , for 3c368 , 3c68.2 and 3c257 respectively . using standard cosmology ( h@xmath7 = 70 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) we compute source intrinsic properties , which are listed in table  2 .",
    "the listed l@xmath10-values originate from the torus modeling : they represent the ( accretion ) luminosities required to power the fitted torus emission .",
    "the l@xmath11-values were determined by integrating the fitted fir grey bodies between 8  and 1000 .",
    "in analogy with other studies @xcite we attribute the torus heating , i.e. , the warm dust component , to the obscured agn : their luminosities are @xmath12 erg sec@xmath3 , confirming the luminous active accretion in these radio - loud type-2 agn , which is consistent with the unification scenario @xcite . attributing the cool dust emission to star - formation , we determine luminosities which are comparable to the agn luminosities ( table  2 ) , all in excess of @xmath13 l@xmath1 . using standard conversions @xcite , the star - formation rate ( sfr ) values are 610 , 390 and 770 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 , for 3c368 , 3c68.2 and 3c257 , respectively .",
    "hence , all three high-@xmath4 radio galaxies are prodigious star - formers erg sec@xmath3 and l@xmath14 l@xmath1 ( sfr 26 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 ) . ] .",
    "four points are noteworthy : ( 1 ) when comparing the sfrs with values inferred from uv / optical data @xcite we conclude that most of the star - formation in these three objects is strongly obscured in that band , ( 2 ) as judged from their radio sizes ( this point will also return later ) , these are mature objects rather than young agn in a transition phase from dust obscured infrared galaxies to agn , ( 3 ) 3c68.2 and 3c257 have cool dust temperatures in the range of those measured for distant sub - millimetre galaxies @xcite , and ( 4 ) as judged from the detection statistics ( @xmath15 ) , many ( if not all ) of our sample objects must have optically obscured star - formation of comparable strength , i.e. , sfrs of hundreds of m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the high star - formation luminosities for these high-@xmath4 radio galaxies are consistent with results from deep field herschel surveys targeting a mix of radio - quiet agn types over a large redshift range out to @xmath16 @xcite and with results from @xmath17 qso studies @xcite , but our detection fraction is higher .",
    "our observations indicate that many distant powerful radio galaxies display star - formation at a level comparable to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) which is coeval to their black hole activity .",
    "that conclusion together with the above mentioned results of herschel studies dealing with powerful radio - quiet agn are in marked contrast with the conclusion @xcite for x - ray selected @xmath18 ( radio - quiet ) agn in the cdf - n , namely that ultra - luminous starburst activity is not seen in the most powerful agn . while detailed comparison of these conflicting results is beyond the scope of this letter we point out two possible explanations .",
    "firstly , the hosts of the cdf - n agn are of lower stellar mass than the radio source hosts .",
    "we stress that distant 3c and 4c objects ( of which only of order @xmath19 are known ) represent the highest peaks in the galaxy mass distribution .",
    "in fact , our observations are in broad agreement with the extrapolated cosmologically evolving specific sfr , ssfr , in the hosts of luminous agn ( and star - forming galaxies ) recently established by @xcite . a  puzzling  inverse correlation between agn x - ray strength and host galaxy mass would be required to explain the @xcite results within the just mentioned ssfr behaviour in combination with our findings for radio - loud agn .",
    "secondly , radio - selected agn  selected using radio lobe luminosity which is an isotropic property ",
    "represent a cleaner , more complete agn subsample than do x - ray - selected agn : the latter may lack the most obscured sources .",
    "the x - ray luminosities reported by @xcite are uncorrected for obscuration , who estimate the effect is small .",
    "x - ray observations for the 3c sources reported here indicate observed luminosities , assuming a standard power - law spectrum with @xmath20 , of about @xmath21 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath22 erg s@xmath3 ( wilkes et al .",
    ", 2012 , in prep . ) and @xmath23 erg s@xmath3 @xcite for 3c68.2 , 3c368 and 3c257 respectively , comparable with sources in the @xcite sample .",
    "it is well known that low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) x - ray data provide poor estimates of obscuration and so result in luminosities uncertain by 12 dex @xcite . indeed , for all three 3c sources reported here ( radio galaxies ) , the x - ray data indicate significant obscuration with estimated n@xmath24 , yielding estimated intrinsic , hard - band x - ray luminosities of @xmath25 erg s@xmath3 for 3c68.2 and 3c368 ( wilkes et al . , 2012 , in prep . ) and @xmath26 erg s@xmath3 for 3c257 ( 210 kev , @xcite ) .",
    "the low s /",
    "n of the x - ray data combined with the likely presence of additional , unobscured , radio - jet - linked emission ( responsible for the typically @xmath27 brighter x - ray luminosities in radio - loud quasars , @xcite ) make it likely that the n@xmath28 and intrinsic x - ray luminosity for these three 3c sources remain underestimated",
    ". although x - ray emission in radio - quiet agn is less complex and may be somewhat lower luminosity , the stronger bias against highly - obscured sources and the difficulty in detecting absorption in the fainter x - ray sources , which are those most likely to be obscured @xcite , is very likely to result in significantly underestimated x - ray luminosities in the page et al .",
    "x - ray - selected sample .",
    "the fact that a higher incidence of x - ray absorption in those sources with 250@xmath5 m detections is also reported strengthens this possibility and so questions their main conclusion : that 250 @xmath5 m emission is undetected , indicating that sf is quenched , in the highest luminosity , l@xmath29 erg s@xmath3 , active galaxies in their sample .",
    "careful examination of the true nature of the high-@xmath4 x - ray agn is required to back - up the proposed negative feedback ; such feedback is definitely not observed in the radio - loud(est ) agn .",
    "while the duration of the vigorous star - formation phase could be longer than the radio - loud activity episode , with the star - formation starting earlier than and possibly eventually being quenched by the agn ( analysis of our full sample of young , mature and old radio sources will address that issue ) , based on our observations there is a substantial symbiotic period .",
    "in contrast to other agn , radio galaxies  with their extended radio structure at high inclination  offer the unique possibility of estimating the age of the activity episode from the linear size of the structure , adopting a typical @xcite source expansion speed of ten to twenty per cent of the speed of light .",
    "the average duration of such an episode follows from the maximum size of radio galaxies at the relevant cosmic epoch .",
    "then 3c68.2 , measuring @xmath30190kpc , has a large dimension implying its agn phase has an age of several million years , while the sizes of 3c368 and 3c257 indicate that they are somewhat younger .",
    "focussing on 3c68.2 , and adopting an agn age of 5  myr , a symbiotic star - formation phase at the inferred sfr of @xmath30500 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 , assuming it to be constant , would yield @xmath31 m@xmath1",
    ". the actual figure could be larger if the star - formation commenced before the agn phase .",
    "the host mass of 3c68.2 , @xmath32 m@xmath1 @xcite , can be formed through @xmath30200 such gas accretion phases , for which there is sufficient time given the age of the universe at that redshift of 4  gyr .",
    "the @xmath30200 associated agn phases will last a total time of @xmath33 yr during which a massive central black hole of @xmath34 m@xmath1 must accrete @xcite .",
    "the implied average black hole fuel consumption of 1 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 yields an energy output @xmath35.dm / dt.@xmath36 which for a typical accretion efficiency @xmath37 equals @xmath38 erg sec@xmath3  about a factor seven below the observed agn luminosity of 3c68.2 .",
    "an essential element in this discussion is the assumption that the growth of the central black hole during agn episodes is in phase with the build - up of its host galaxy .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility of a more energetic star - forming phase ( for instance at sfr @xmath39 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 ) , but such sfrs remain to be observed in high - redshift radio galaxies .",
    "however , if the star - forming phase lasts about a factor ten longer than the symbiotic phase , then @xmath3020 such events are needed to build - up the massive galaxy . in that case the mass consumption required to build its black hole during the @xmath3020 agn episodes would be in agreement with the measured agn luminosity .",
    "other forms of symbiotic occurrences can also be envisaged , including pure agn phases not linked to coeval starbursts and the direct capture of stars through galaxy - galaxy merging .",
    "whereas low redshift ulirgs are believed to originate from major mergers , high redshift ulirgs in the form of submm galaxies might have formed through cold gas accretion @xcite ; the same has been postulated for high redshift agn @xcite . even at their extreme stellar masses ,",
    "our 3c hosts obey the ssfr(@xmath4 ) behaviour for non - agn and x - ray agn @xcite .",
    "however , their x - ray luminosities are higher , by orders of magnitudes ; moreover they are radio - loud .",
    "they may well mark the rare , most extreme examples of the universal accretion to star - formation rate ratio postulated by @xcite .",
    "following these authors , we contend that the full symbiosis whereby a cold gas inflow driven , vigorous star - formation episode leads into ( and may be quenched by ) an energetic agn phase , offers an attractive scenario for the reason of a common fuel supply , building up both black hole and stellar mass .",
    "following implications from submm emission , mid - ir spectra and ly-@xmath40 emission , we now know unambiguously that a substantial fraction of the hosts of high - redshift radio galaxies are dust and gas rich , undergoing one of likely many phases of copious star - formation . energetically speaking they are comparable to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "our study shows accretion and star - formation activity simultaneously at work in the most massive early - epoch galaxies , building these galaxies and their central black holes , forcefully and effectfully",
    ". it will be important to extend the investigations to radio - loud agn hosted by less massive galaxies .",
    "radio - loud activity phases must play an important role in galaxy formation .",
