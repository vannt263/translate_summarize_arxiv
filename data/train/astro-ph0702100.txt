    "various strategies for speeding up ml estimation have been proposed , such as , exploiting the symmetries of the scan strategy ( oh et al .",

    "for highly sensitive experiments , the systematic errors arising from the beam non - circularity become progressively more important . dropping the circular beam assumption leads to major complications at every stage of the analysis pipeline . the extent to which the non - circularity of the beam affects the step of going from the time - stream data to sky map is very sensitive to the scan - strategy .",
    "the beam now has an orientation with respect to the scan path that can potentially vary along the path .",
    "this introduces an additional complication - that the beam function is inherently time dependent and difficult to deconvolve .    even after a sky map is made , the non - circularity of the effective beam affects the estimation of the angular power spectrum , @xmath4 , by coupling the power at different multipoles , typically , on scales beyond the inverse angular beam - width .",

    "we have ( semi)empirically estimated the cpu time required by our codes for equal declination scan strategies with apodized masks . since the computation cost for equal declination scan strategies is the _ same _ as that for non - rotating beams , we use the latter for simplicity .",

    "further reduction of computation is conceivable in the future :    1 .",
    "if we take into account that the bias matrix is _ most significant _ only along a narrow strip ( approximately @xmath140 = 20 elements wide on average and not necessarily uniform - could be wedge shaped ) around the diagonal of the bias matrix , the time estimate reduces by another power of @xmath12 .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ timing ] refers to the plot of estimated computation time against multipole in the log scale , with the slope reduced by 1 ( i.e. 5 - 1=4 ) .",

    "it is possible to reducing the computation cost by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "if all the above modifications are implemented , the bias calculation is expected to be feasible in quite reasonable time with the computing facilities available / dedicated to the cmb community .",

    "that , this is a conservative estimate . with advanced implementation of the numerics having exact algorithmic scaling",
    ", the computation time can reduce by as much as one order of magnitude .",
    "the inclusion of the effect of noncircular beam leads to major complications at every stage of the data analysis pipeline . the extent to which the non - circularity affects the step of going from the time - stream data to sky map is also very sensitive to the scan - strategy .",
    "the beam now has an orientation with respect to the scan path that can potentially vary along the path .",
    "this implies that the beam function is inherently time dependent and difficult to deconvolve .    in our present work ,",
    "we have extended our analytic approach for estimating the leading order bias due to noncircular experimental beam on the angular power spectrum @xmath172 of cmb anisotropy - the analytical framework now includes the effect of incomplete sky coverage and it is no more limited to only the leading order correction .",
    "it can also incorporate the case of equal declination scans without demanding any change in the codes or the computation cost . though the numerical implementation does not include the effect of most general scan strategy , the formalism presented in this work is valid for estimating the full bias correction using a ( semi)analytic perturbative method that can replace the computationally costly end - to - end simulation used for current cmb experiments .",
    "this work also provides an analytic framework to perform the simulation steps more efficiently .",
    "noncircular beam effects can be modeled into the covariance functions in approaches related to maximum likelihood estimation ( tegmark 1997 , bond et al .",
    "1998 ) and can also be included in the harmonic ring ( challinor et al .",
    "2002 ) and ring - torus estimators ( wandelt & hansen 2003 ) .",
    "however , all these methods are computationally prohibitive for high resolution maps and , at present , the computationally economical approach of using a pseudo-@xmath4 estimator appears to be a viable option for extracting the power spectrum at high multipoles ( efstathiou 2004 ) .",
    "the pseudo-@xmath4 estimates have to be corrected for the systematic biases .",
    "while considerable attention has been devoted to the effects of incomplete / non - uniform sky coverage , no comprehensive or systematic approach is available for noncircular beam .",
    "the high sensitivity , ` full ' ( large ) sky observation from space ( long duration balloon ) missions have alleviated the effect of incomplete sky coverage and other systematic effects such as the one we consider here have gained more significance .",
    "non - uniform coverage , in particular , the galactic masks affect only cmb power estimation at the low multipoles . the analysis accompanying the recent second data release from wmap uses the hybrid strategy ( efstathiou 2004 ) where the power spectrum at low multipoles is estimated using optimal maximum likelihood methods and pseudo-@xmath4 are used for large multipoles hinshaw et al .",
    "2007 , spergel et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the noncircular beam is an effect that dominates at large @xmath12 beyond the the inverse beam width ( mitra et al .",
    "2004 ) . for high resolution experiments ,",
    "the optimal maximum likelihood methods which can account for non - circular beam functions are computationally prohibitive . in implementing the pseudo-@xmath4 estimation ,",
    "we have included both the non - rotating noncircular beam effect and the effect of non - uniform sky coverage .",
    "our preliminary estimate shows that the computation cost for @xmath2 is within reach .",
    "furthermore , equal declination scan strategies can be trivially included in this implementation .",
    "our work provides a convenient approach for estimating the magnitude of these effects in terms of the leading order deviations from a circular beam and azimuthally symmetric mask .",
    "the perturbative approach is very efficient . for most cmb experiments the leading few orders capture most of the effect of beam non - circularity ( souradeep & ratra 2001 ) .",
    "our results highlight the advantage of azimuthally smoothed masks ( mild deviations from azimuthal symmetry ) in reducing computational costs .",
    "this process is more efficient as compared to the isotropic apodization of masks ( efstathiou 2006 ) , that suffers a lot more information loss at the edges . the numerical implementation of our method can readily accommodate the case when pixels are revisited by the beam with different orientations .",
    "evaluating the realistic bias and error - covariance for a specific cmb experiment with noncircular beams would require numerical evaluation of the general expressions for @xmath46 using real scan strategy and account for inhomogeneous noise and sky coverage , the latter part of which has been addressed in this present work .",
    "it is worthwhile to note in passing that that the angular power @xmath4 contains all the information of gaussian cmb anisotropy only under the assumption of statistical isotropy .",
    "gaussian cmb anisotropy map measured with a non - circular beam corresponds to an underlying correlation function that violates statistical isotropy . in this case",
    ", the extra information present may be measurable using , for example , the bipolar power spectrum ( hajian & souradeep 2003 , hajian et al .",
    "2004 , hajian & souradeep 2006 , basak et al .",
    "even when the beam is circular the scanning pattern itself is expected to cause a breakdown of statistical isotropy of the measured cmb anisotropy ( hivon et al .",
    "2002 ) . for a non - circular beam",
    ", this effect could be much more pronounced and , perhaps , presents an interesting avenue of future study .",

    "this is perhaps more critical for methods that first deconvolve the primordial perturbation from the cmb maps ( yadav & wandelt , 2005 and yadav & wandelt 2008 ) since differences between the actual and circular beam approximations could get amplified and propagated through the step of deconvolution .",
    "in addition to temperature fluctuations , the cmb photons coming from different directions have a random , linear polarization .",
    "the polarization of cmb can be decomposed into @xmath173 part with even parity and @xmath174 part with odd parity .",
    "besides the angular spectrum @xmath175 , the cmb polarization provides three additional spectra , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 which are invariant under parity transformations .",

    "<S> over the last decade , measurements of the cmb anisotropy has spearheaded the remarkable transition of cosmology into a precision science . however , addressing the systematic effects in the increasingly sensitive , high resolution , ` full ' sky measurements from different cmb experiments pose a stiff challenge . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis techniques must not only be computationally fast to contend with the huge size of the data , but , the higher sensitivity also limits the simplifying assumptions which can then be invoked to achieve the desired speed without compromising the final precision goals . while maximum likelihood is desirable , the enormous computational cost makes the suboptimal method of power spectrum estimation using pseudo - c@xmath0 unavoidable for high resolution data . </S>",
    "<S> the debiasing of the pseudo - c@xmath0 needs account for non - circular beams , together with non - uniform sky coverage . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a ( semi)analytic framework to estimate bias in the power spectrum due to the effect of beam non - circularity and non - uniform sky coverage including incomplete / masked sky maps and scan strategy . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is perturbative in the distortion of the beam from non - circularity , allowing for rapid computations when the beam is mildly non - circular . </S>",
    "<S> we advocate that it is computationally advantageous to employ ` soft ' azimuthally apodized masks whose spherical harmonic transform die down fast with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically implement our method for _ non - rotating beams_. we present preliminary estimates of the computational cost to evaluate the bias for the upcoming cmb anisotropy probes ( @xmath2 ) , with angular resolution comparable to the planck surveyor mission . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that this implementation and estimate is applicable for rotating beams on equal declination scans and possibly can be extended to simple approximations to other scan strategies .    cosmic microwave background </S>"
