    "the self - consistent mean - field theory , also known as time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) , by employing skyrme - type effective interactions , has been extensively applied to describe nuclear collision dynamics at low bombarding energies below 10  mev per nucleon  @xcite . in the mean - field theory ,",
    "short range two - body correlations are neglected and nucleons move in the self - consistent potential produced by all other nucleons .",
    "this is a good approximation at low energies since pauli blocking is very effective for scattering into unoccupied states .",

    ". one important limitation of the mean - field theory is related with dynamical fluctuations of collective motion . in the mean - field description , while single - particle motion is treated in quantal framework , collective motion is treated almost in classical approximation . therefore , tdhf provides a good description for average evolution , however it severely underestimates fluctuations of collective variables .    on the other hand , it is well known that no dissipation takes place without fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "one of the fundamental questions is how to improve the mean - field theory by incorporating one - body fluctuation mechanism at a microscopic level ? in a recent work , based on an appealing idea of dasso  @xcite , this question has been addressed . a stochastic mean - field ( smf ) approach has been proposed for describing fluctuation dynamics  @xcite . for small amplitude fluctuations",

    "it is remarkable that expressions of transport coefficients for the relative motion ( as well as transport coefficients for other macroscopic variables which are not mentioned in this work ) have the same form as given by the phenomenological nucleon exchange model  @xcite .",
