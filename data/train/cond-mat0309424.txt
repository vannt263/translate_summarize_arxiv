    "located far away from the scattering region lead to boundary conditions in the form of incoming plane waves . in this contribution",
    ", we study the behaviour of spatially localized electron sources in perpendicular , homogeneous electric and magnetic fields . our discussion is based on the framework of quantum source theory , a variant of the scattering formalism that is especially suited to describe scattering events restricted to a region of finite volume @xcite .",
    "the idea of quantum sources was first promoted by schwinger @xcite but has not found widespread attention .",
    "therefore , we briefly introduce the concept and some basic results derived from it , and stress its connection to the propagator approach to quantum mechanics @xcite . in fact , stationary elastic scattering at pointlike sources is fully described in terms of the energy green function .",
    "several fundamental properties of the quantum system , like the scattering wave function , current density distribution , cross section , and local density of states , immediately follow from this functional . here",

    "in preparation for our later discussion , we illustrate the quantum source formalism using potential scattering in external static fields as an example .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath2 represents a localized disturbance , and that the charged quantum particles otherwise move in the external electromagnetic potentials @xmath3 , @xmath4 : @xmath5 the scattering solutions @xmath6 , which are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath7 with energy @xmath8 , then usually are decomposed into two parts , @xmath9 , where the incident wave is a solution for the unperturbed system @xmath10 : @xmath11 , whereas the remainder @xmath12 represents the scattering wave . by comparison with ( [ eq : th01 ] )",

    "in the continuous spectrum of @xmath7 , the green function is not uniquely defined .",
    "depending on our choice for @xmath19 , we obtain a set of wave functions @xmath24 that differ only by eigenfunctions @xmath25 of @xmath18 .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved by the demand that @xmath19 presents a retarded solution that enforces outgoing - wave behaviour of the scattering wave @xmath12 at large distances from the source .",

    ", few energy green functions are available in closed form for problems in more than one spatial dimension .",
    "this list includes free particles in two and three dimensions , as well as the coulomb problem @xcite , uniformly accelerated quantum motion @xcite , the isotropic harmonic oscillator @xcite , motion in a homogeneous magnetic field @xcite , and parallel electric and magnetic fields @xcite , all in three - dimensional configuration space .",

    "is directly related to the differential cross section of the scattering process .",
    "integration of @xmath38 over a surface enclosing @xmath15 will yield the total current @xmath40 emitted by the source which , in turn , is a measure of the total scattering rate . for a concise expression , we first note that the inhomogeneous schrdinger equation ( [ eq : th02 ] ) gives rise to a modified equation of continuity . instead of @xmath41 , valid for a stationary system in the absence of sources ,",

    ", the scattering wave is a multiple of the green function , @xmath47 , and the pattern of the current distribution follows from ( [ eq : currdens ] ) .",
    "point sources yield a particularly simple expression for the total cross section : @xmath48 in passing , we remark that for @xmath49 , the green function @xmath19 diverges in more than one spatial dimension , while its imaginary part remains well - defined in the limit and is proportional to the scattering rate .",
    "the statement ( [ eq : jdelta ] ) is closely related to the optical theorem of conventional scattering theory @xcite .    for reference , we list the total currents emitted by a free - particle point source of unit strength ( @xmath50 ) in one- , two- , and three - dimensional configuration space . for @xmath51",

    "somewhat surprisingly , the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath54 of the quantum system , i.  e. , the accumulated density @xmath55 of the eigenfunctions of the system with energy @xmath8 , evaluated at @xmath23 , is , apart from a prefactor , identical to the total current @xmath56 emitted by a point source located at the same position .",
    "formally , this equivalence is established from equation ( [ eq : greenenergy2 ] ) by setting @xmath57 and using the distribution relation @xcite @xmath58 = -\\pi\\,{{\\rm sgn}}\\,\\eta\\cdot \\delta(z)$ ] that holds in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "thus , we formally obtain : @xmath60 = -\\pi \\left\\langle \\mathbf r ' \\left| \\delta(e-\\mathbf h ) \\right|\\mathbf r'\\right\\rangle \\;.\\ ] ] the right - hand side of this relation formally contains the spatial representation of the density of states operator @xmath61 , and we conclude that the ldos is linked to the imaginary part of the green function . in conjunction with ( [ eq : jdelta ] ) , this implies that the density of states is directly proportional to the previously defined total current @xmath56 : @xmath62 we note here that the localized eigenstates of @xmath7 that make up the discrete spectrum of the hamiltonian are irrelevant for the imaginary part of the green function , and thus do not contribute to the current .",
    "it is the unbounded solutions in the continuous spectrum of @xmath7 that are entirely responsible for the outgoing wave character of @xmath19 and constitute @xmath56 . from ( [ eq : jdos ] ) , we conclude that a non - vanishing density of states is therefore directly related to an extended flow pattern in position space .",
    "we will show examples of this behaviour in section  [ sec : flowpattern ] .      in the following",
