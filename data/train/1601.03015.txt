    "the subprime crisis of 2007 - 2009 showed that many small defaulting debtors can drag down the whole economy  @xcite . with",
    "the collapse of lehman brothers the devastating consequences of failed credit risk management became apparent to the public .",
    "the recessions following such crises further fuel a rise in the default probability  @xcite . during the past years",
    "many studies have pointed out the importance of better credit risk estimation and proposed different approaches , see refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "the crucial problem is to determine the loss distribution for a large portfolio of credit contracts .",
    "the danger lies in the heavy right tail of the loss distribution . here",
    ", the very large losses occur , for example large single events such as enron or many small events as during the subprime crisis .",
    "reducing this tail would increase the stability of the financial system as a whole .",
    "it is often argued that diversification will lower the risk of a portfolio .",
    "this claim is highly problematic . in reality ,",
    "correlations between the asset values are very important in assessing the risk if we consider a portfolio of credit contracts , eg , in the form of collateralized debt obligations ( cdos ) .",
    "it has been shown that in presence of even weak positive correlations diversification fails to reduce the portfolio risk , see  @xcite for first passage models and for the merton model  @xcite .    here",
    ", we generalize the merton model for credit portfolios to take fluctuating correlations between the asset values into account .",
    "the fluctuations are due to the non - stationarity inherent in financial markets  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the covariance and correlation matrix of asset values changes in time  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the asset values are distributed according to a correlation averaged multivariate distribution , which we recently introduced  @xcite .",
    "the validity of this assumption is verified by an extensive empirical study of the asset returns .",
    "starting from this distribution we derive analytical results for the probability distribution of portfolio losses in case of homogeneous average correlations between the assets .",
    "this ensemble approach leads to a drastic reduction of the parameter space .",
    "we are left with two parameters , the average correlation between asset values and the strength of the fluctuations .",
    "the special case of zero average correlation has been previously considered  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we are able to derive a limiting distribution for a portfolio containing an infinite number of assets . this contributes a quantitative reasoning to the limits of diversification .",
    "furthermore , we provide monte - carlo simulations for the general case of empirical correlation matrices studying the value at risk ( var ) and expected tail loss ( etl ) .",
    "first , we show that it is reasonable to use a homogeneous average correlation matrix if the heterogeneous volatilities and drifts are taken into account .",
    "second , the importance of modeling the fluctuations of the correlations is underlined by the simulations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ ch : pavg ] introduces a correlation averaged asset value distribution for the merton model . in section [ ch : data ]",
    "we show that this distribution fits the empirical data well and we determine the parameter for the distribution from empirical data .",
    "we calculate the average loss distribution in section [ ch : lossdist ] and present the implications to risk management in section [ ch : results ] .",
    "[ ch : model ]    we use the merton model  @xcite as a basis .",
    "we consider a portfolio of @xmath0 credit contracts and assume that the obligors are publicly traded companies .",
    "it was merton s idea to use the stock price @xmath1 of each obligor @xmath2 as a proxy for the asset value @xmath3 at time @xmath4 . at the maturity time",
    "@xmath5 the obligor has to pay back the face value @xmath6 of the credit contract .",
    "the equity of the company can then be viewed as a european call option on its asset value with a strike price equal to the face value @xmath6 .",
    "the face value consists of the money given to the obligor , interest and a risk compensation . in the merton model",
    ", a default occurs if the asset value at maturity , @xmath7 , is below the face value @xmath6 . the ensuing normalized loss is then given as @xmath8 the heaviside step function @xmath9 ensures that the loss @xmath10 is always equal to or greater than zero .",
    "the total loss of the credit portfolio is given by the sum of the individual losses @xmath10 , weighted by their fraction @xmath11 in the portfolio , @xmath12 since the losses are a direct result from the asset values at maturity , the portfolio loss distribution can be calculated as a filter integral , @xmath13 \\ g ( v|\\sigma )   \\delta \\left ( l - \\sum_{k=1}^k f_k l_k \\right )      \\label{eq : loss3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 is the distribution of the asset values at maturity time @xmath5 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a stationary @xmath17 covariance matrix without fluctuations .",
    "the measure @xmath18 $ ] is the product of the differentials for each asset value @xmath7 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : loss3 ] ) was cast into the form @xmath19 in  @xcite .",
    "we have two requirements for the distribution of the asset values @xmath14 .",
    "first , it has to be realistic , ie , the distribution should describe the empirical data well and address the non - stationarity of financial markets .",
    "second , it should be analytically tractable .",
    "we achieve both goals by using an ensemble approach which allows us to greatly simplify the description of the financial market . in  @xcite",
    "we introduced the random matrix average of a correlated multivariate normal distribution , which takes the non - stationarity of the covariance matrix into account .",
    "importantly , our ensemble is not fictitious , it really exists as a consequence of the non - stationarity : the correlation or covariance matrices measured at different times differ from each other at a statistically significant level .",
    "the set of all these matrices forms our ensemble .",
    "the distribution is the result of averaging a multivariate normal distribution over an ensemble of wishart distributed correlation matrices  @xcite .",
    "we use it to describe the return vector @xmath20 with @xmath21 of @xmath0 stocks , where @xmath22 is the return interval .",
    "we start with the average return distribution @xmath23 which is compared to the data comparison in section  [ ch : data ] . to simplify the notation",
    ", we omit the time dependence of @xmath24 when @xmath24 appears in the argument of a distribution .",
    "the average asset value distribution can then easily be calculated from the average return distribution .",
    "the general result for the average return distribution with fluctuating covariances is @xmath25 with the bessel function @xmath26 of second kind and of order @xmath27 .",
    "we do not use the wishart distribution to describe the measurement noise due to finite time series , but to model the actual non - stationarity of the covariances .",
    "hence , @xmath28 is a free parameter , which controls the strength of the fluctuations around the average covariance matrix @xmath16 , as discussed in more detail in section  [ ch : data ] . in the context of credit risk , we are interested in changes of the asset values over the time period @xmath5",
    ". therefore we will consider an equally long return interval , @xmath29 in the following we express the covariance matrix @xmath16 in terms of the average correlation matrix @xmath30 with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 contains the standard deviations for each of the @xmath0 assets .",
    "we achieve analytical tractability by assuming a homogeneous average correlation matrix , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 unit matrix and @xmath36 is a @xmath0 component vector with ones as its elements .",
    "this implies that all off - diagonal matrix elements are equal to @xmath37 .",
    "we emphasize that this is only an assumption about the average correlation matrix , the correlations in our approach fluctuate around this mean value .",
    "later on , we show that this approximation yields a good description of the empirical data .",
    "this construction allows us to capture the correlation structure of the financial market by only two parameters : the average correlation level @xmath37 and the parameter @xmath28 which indicates the strength of the fluctuations around this average . inserting the homogeneous correlation matrix ( [ eq : c ] ) into the general result for the average return distribution ( [ eq : genresult ] ) and performing the calculations described in  @xcite yields @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the term @xmath40 is the result of the jacobian determinant due to the transformation from returns @xmath41 to asset values @xmath7 @xmath42 using it s lemma  @xcite . in the spirit of the merton model",
    "we assume that the asset values follow a geometric brownian motion .",
    "we recall that the maturity time sets the return interval , @xmath43 .",
    "when we later insert the asset value distribution  ( [ eq : avg_result ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : loss ] ) , we want to achieve a factorization of the @xmath44 integrals . therefore , we do not perform the @xmath45 integration at this point .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : avg_result ] ) is our result for the average asset value distribution at maturity time @xmath5 . due to the coordinate transformation from returns to asset values ,",
    "the formerly dimensionless standard deviations @xmath46 are substituted by the volatilities @xmath47 with dimension one over the square root of time , @xmath48 before we derive the average loss distribution , we give an extensive empirical validation of our ensemble approach in the next section .",
    "we carry out the data analysis on two different datasets , which are obtained from yahoo finance  @xcite .",
    "we select stocks from the standard & poor s 500index ( s&p 500 ) which are continuously traded in each time period we study .",
    "the composition of the s&p 500 is focused on the performing us companies .",
    "the second dataset we use includes all stocks which are continuously traded at the nasdaq during our observation periods .",
    "the nasdaq dataset takes a much broader selection of companies into account .",
    "we analyse the multivariate time series of returns ( [ eq : return ] ) for these two datasets . for the derivation of the average return distribution @xmath49 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : genresult ] ) , we assume that the returns are well described by a multivariate normal distribution @xmath50 on short time horizons where the covariance matrix @xmath51 for this time interval can be viewed as stationary , see  @xcite .",
    "we recall that we receive the average return distribution by averaging eq .",
    "( [ multivar ] ) over an ensemble of wishart distributed correlation matrices .",
    "again , we notice that the correlation matrix is closely connected to the covariance matrix via @xmath52 .",
    "we calculate the return time series for a return interval of @xmath53 trading day . these time series",
    "are then partitioned into short , non - overlapping intervals of 25 trading days . on these short intervals",
    "we can view the covariance matrix @xmath51 as constant .",
    "since the length of the time series on these intervals is smaller than the dimension of the covariance matrix , it is non  invertible .",
    "this will not cause problems from a mathematical point of view , because the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ multivar ] ) is properly defined in terms of @xmath54-functions . for the data analysis",
    "we take all pairs of returns @xmath55 which , if our assumption  ( [ multivar ] ) is true , should be bivariate normal distributed with a @xmath56 covariance matrix @xmath57 .",
    "this matrix is always invertible .",
    "next , we rotate the vectors @xmath58 into the eigenbasis of @xmath57 and normalize the elements of the vector with the corresponding eigenvalues . the aggregated distribution of all pairs of returns is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pw ] .",
    "the left figure shows the aggregated results from a dataset with @xmath59 stocks taken from the s&p 500 index which where continuously traded in the period from 1992 - 2012 .",
    "the right figure presents the distribution of all pairs of returns for a dataset consisting of @xmath60 stocks from nasdaq from 2002 to 2012 .",
    "both distributions are for daily returns .",
    "we find that for short time horizons , assuming a fixed covariance matrix @xmath51 , the distribution of all pairs of returns fits a normal distribution rather well .",
    "we now use the average return distribution ( [ eq : genresult ] ) to calculate a distribution of rotated and scaled returns which can be compared to empirical data .",
    "we rotate the vector @xmath24 into the eigenbasis of the covariance matrix @xmath16 and normalize each element with its corresponding eigenvalue . integrating out all degrees of freedom except one ,",
    "we obtain the distribution of the rotated and scaled returns @xmath61 @xmath62 which once again contains a bessel function of the second kind but now of order @xmath63 .",
    "we evaluate the probability distribution of the rotated and scaled returns from empirical data for the averaged covariance matrix @xmath16 and the covariance matrix @xmath64 with homogeneous correlation structure , given the averaged correlation matrix @xmath30 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : cov1 ] and [ fig : cov20 ] show the probability distributions for the rotated and scaled returns calculated using the empirical covariance matrix @xmath16 with inhomogeneous correlation structure .",
    "we analyzed four different datasets on two time horizons .",
    "the first dataset consists of @xmath59 stocks taken from the s&p 500 index which were continuously traded in the period from 1992 - 2012 ( top left ) .",
    "the second set includes @xmath65 stocks from the s&p 500 on the time horizon from 2002 to 2012 ( top right ) .",
    "then we use @xmath66 and @xmath60 stocks from nasdaq for the two time horizons ( bottom left / right ) , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov1 ] for daily returns and in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov20 ] for monthly returns .",
    "we carry out a cramer - von mises test to confirm the result of the least squares fit which determines the parameter @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ rk ] ) , see table  [ tab : n ] .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     in all cases we observe decreasing deviations from the empirical covariance matrix for larger leverages @xmath67 .",
    "this shows that the structure of the correlation matrix plays a minor role and underlines the importance of getting the volatilities right .    in figure",
    "[ fig : var ] we demonstrate how the var is underestimated by using stationary correlations .",
    "we calculate the relative deviation of the var for @xmath68 and for different values of @xmath28 .",
    "the case @xmath68 does not allow fluctuations of the covariance matrix and thereby effectively disables the benefits of the random matrix approach .",
    "we use the empirical covariance matrix for 2006 - 2010 , ie , the volatilities and drifts are heterogeneous . for the empirically observed value of @xmath69",
    "the var is underestimated between @xmath70% and @xmath71% .",
    "we recall that an empirical covariance matrix needs larger values for the parameter @xmath28 as discussed in section  [ ch : data ] .        for a homogeneous correlation matrix ,",
    "figure  [ fig : mod ] shows how much stationary correlations underestimate the var dependent on the average correlation level @xmath37 .",
    "the var is underestimated by roughly 45% for typical average correlation levels between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we showed that an ensemble average of random correlation matrices yields a suitable asset value distribution .",
    "while empirical data on asset values is difficult to obtain , we can use stock prices as a good proxy according to the merton model .",
    "our ensemble approach is supported by two different comparisons with empirical data .",
    "first , we showed that stock returns follow a multivariate normal distribution , if the time interval for the sample is rather short .",
    "second , the sample statistics of returns on large time horizons can be described by a multivariate mixture , where the multivariate normal distribution is averaged over an ensemble of wishart - distributed covariance matrices .",
    "this allowed us to derive the loss distribution for a portfolio of credit contracts , taking fluctuating correlations between asset values into account .",
    "in addition , we were able to derive an analytical expression for the limit distribution of infinite portfolio size in case of a homogeneous portfolio .",
    "we performed monte - carlo simulations for var and etl .",
    "the results support our ansatz of homogeneous average correlations if the heterogeneous average volatilities are taken into account .",
    "the simulations reveal an underestimation of the var by roughly 40% when fluctuating correlations between the asset values are neglected .",
    "our ensemble approach allows us to capture the correlation structure of the financial market by only two `` macroscopic '' parameters , the average correlation level and the strength of the fluctuations around this average .",
    "in addition , our model provides a quantitative understanding for why the presence of asset correlations severely limits the benefits of diversification for credit risk . as a consequence ,",
    "our results strongly support a conservative approach to capital reserve requirements .",
