    "ldpc convolutional codes , the convolutional counterparts of ldpc block codes , were introduced in @xcite , and they have been shown to have certain advantages compared to ldpc block codes of the same complexity @xcite . in this paper , we use ensembles of @xmath0 regular tail - biting ldpc convolutional codes derived from a protograph - based ensemble of ldpc block codes to obtain a lower bound on the free distance to constraint length ratio of unterminated , asymptotically good , periodically time - varying regular ldpc convolutional code ensembles , i.e. , ensembles that have the property of free distance growing linearly with constraint length .    in the process , we show that the minimum distances of ensembles of tail - biting ldpc convolutional codes ( introduced in @xcite ) approach the free distance of an associated unterminated , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional code ensemble as the block length of the tail - biting ensemble increases .",
    "we show that , for rate @xmath1 protograph - based ensembles with regular degree distributions , the free distance bounds are consistent with those recently derived for more general regular ldpc convolutional code ensembles in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we show , for all the ( @xmath2,@xmath3)-regular ensembles considered , that the free distance to constraint length ratio exceeds the minimum distance to block length ratio of the corresponding block codes .",

    "this process is demonstrated for a ( 3,4)-regular protograph with the nonuniform cut @xmath106 below :        ldpc convolutional codes unwrapped from @xmath107 can be encoded by a conventional ldpc convolutional encoder with the condition that information symbols are not assigned to the all - zero columns .",
    "thus , these columns correspond to punctured symbols , and the code rate is not affected . at the decoder , a conventional pipeline decoder can be employed to decode the received sequence .",
    "no special treatment is necessary for the symbols corresponding to the all - zero columns , since the column weight of zero insures that they are not included in any parity - check equations , i.e. , the belief - propagation decoding algorithm ignores the corresponding symbols .",
    "we now introduce the notion of tail - biting convolutional codes by defining an ` unwrapping factor ' @xmath108 as the number of times the sliding convolutional structure is repeated . for @xmath109 , the parity - check matrix @xmath110 of the desired tail - biting convolutional code",
    "can be written as    @xmath111_{\\lambda n_c \\times \\lambda n_v}.\\ ] ]    note that the tail - biting convolutional code for @xmath112 is simply the original block code .",
    "given a protograph parity - check matrix @xmath36 , we generate a family of tail - biting convolutional codes with increasing block lengths @xmath113 , @xmath114 , using the process described above .",
    "since tail - biting convolutional codes are themselves block codes , we can treat the tanner graph of @xmath110 as a protograph for each value of @xmath108 . replacing the entries of this matrix with either @xmath115 permutation matrices or @xmath35 all zero matrices , as discussed in section [ sec : proto ] ,",

    "each tail - biting ldpc code ensemble , in turn , can be unwrapped and repeated indefinitely to form an ensemble of unterminated , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional codes with decoding constraint length @xmath117 and period @xmath118 .",
    "intuitively , as @xmath108 increases , the tail - biting code becomes a better representation of the associated unterminated convolutional code , with @xmath119 corresponding to the unterminated convolutional code itself .",
    "this is reflected in the weight enumerators , and it is shown in section [ sec : bounds ] that increasing @xmath108 provides us with distance growth rates that converge to a lower bound on the free distance growth rate of the unterminated convolutional code .",
    "tail - biting convolutional codes can be used to establish a lower bound on the free distance of an associated unterminated , periodically time - varying convolutional code by showing that the free distance of the unterminated code is lower bounded by the minimum distance of any of its tail - biting versions .",

    "let @xmath122 be the minimum distance of the associated tail - biting convolutional code with length @xmath116 and unwrapping factor @xmath123 .",
    "then the free distance @xmath124 of the unterminated convolutional code is lower bounded by @xmath122 for any unwrapping factor @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath125    _ sketch of proof .",
    "_ it can be shown that any codeword in a rate @xmath120 unterminated , periodically time - varying convolutional code with constraint length @xmath126 and period @xmath127 can be wrapped back to a codeword in a tail - biting convolutional code of length @xmath128 , for any @xmath108 . the ` wrapping back ' procedure consists of dividing the convolutional codeword into segments of length @xmath129 and superimposing these segments through a modulo summation .",
    "the hamming weight of the resulting codeword in the tail - biting code must be equal to or less than that of the codeword in the unterminated code .",
    "the result is then obtained by wrapping back the unterminated codeword with minimum hamming weight . for a formal proof , see @xcite .",
    "a trivial corollary of the above theorem is that the minimum distance of a protograph - based ldpc block code is a lower bound on the free distance of the associated unterminated , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional code .",
    "this can be observed by setting @xmath130 .",
    "the distance growth rate @xmath60 of a block code ensemble is defined as its minimum distance to block length ratio . for the protograph - based tail - biting ldpc convolutional codes defined in section [ sec : tailll ] , this ratio is therefore given as @xmath131 using ( [ emre ] ) we obtain @xmath132 where @xmath124 is the free distance of the associated unterminated , periodically time - varying ldpc convolutional code .",
    "it is important to note that , for convolutional codes , the length of the shortest codeword is equal to the encoding constraint length @xmath133 , which in general differs from the decoding constraint length @xmath134 . assuming minimal encoder and syndrome former matrices , the relation between @xmath133 and @xmath134 can be expressed as @xmath135 which implies that , for code rates less than @xmath1 , the encoding constraint length is larger than the decoding constraint length .    combining ( [ zorro ] ) and ( [ spiderman ] ) gives us the desired bound on the free distance growth rate @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the convolutional code free distance growth rate ) results in an upper bound on @xmath133 , which implies that @xmath138 is underestimated in this case . ] .",
