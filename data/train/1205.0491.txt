    "the infrared regime of quantum chromodynamics is one of the prime examples of non - perturbative physics giving rise to such fascinating phenomena as the confinement of quarks and the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the only method so far to obtain quantitatively reliable results directly from the underlying theory has been lattice gauge theory , and it has done so only in a limited fashion . for a long time , it was generally believed that analytical tools could not be of much help in the quantitative description of the aforementioned phenomena .",
    "this point of view is now slowly changing . in this contribution , before describing our own approach to the subject to which the title refers , we will try to give an overview , from our perspective , of what has been achieved so far in ( the pure gauge sector of ) infrared quantum chromodynamics with analytical and semi - analytical methods .",
    "needless to say , progress with these methods has also been limited , but there have been some recent very promising developments .",
    "the story begins in 1978 with the publication of gribov s seminal work on the quantization of non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "it was clear by that time that for the quantization of a gauge theory in the continuum the gauge needs to be fixed , and that , at least for perturbation theory , covariant gauges are particularly convenient .",
    "specializing to the landau gauge , the functional integral over the gauge field then includes two characteristic pieces : a functional delta distribution that implements the gauge condition @xmath0 , and a functional determinant ( jacobian ) that arises when one changes the integration variables from the general gauge fields @xmath1 to gauge equivalent fields @xmath2 that fulfill the gauge condition , and the corresponding gauge transformations @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the delta distribution can conveniently be written with the help of a bosonic auxiliary field called the nakanishi - lautrup field,(_a^a _ ) = d [ b ] ( -i d^d x b^a _ a^a _ ) , [ deltaf ] while the jacobian is represented in a local way as a functional integral over ( fermionic scalar ) ghost and antighost fields , ( -_d^ab _ ) = d [ c , |c ] ( d^d x |c^a _ d^ab_c^b ) .",
    "[ fpdet ] we are generally working in @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space - time , and the covariant derivative ( in the adjoint representation ) is defined as d^ab_= ^ab _ - g f^abc a^c_. in the functional integral of the theory ( for gauge invariant operators ) the integral over the gauge transformations @xmath3 then factorizes and can consistently be omitted , and one is left in the pure gauge sector with an integral over @xmath1 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the ( negative of the ) faddeev - popov action s _ = d^d x ( f^a _ f^a _",

    "[ brst ] an important property of this transformation ( including the transformation of the matter fields ) is its nilpotency , @xmath10 .",
    "note that the transformation of the gluon field has the form of an infinitesimal gauge transformation with the ghost field replacing the generator of the gauge transformation .",
    "the ward identities corresponding to the brst symmetry are the slavnov - taylor identities for the correlation functions .",
    "as it turns out , the beta function for this theory is negative giving rise to the celebrated asymptotic freedom of non - abelian gauge theories and the applicability of perturbation theory in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "in the language of renormalization group theory , non - abelian gauge theories have a trivial fixed point ( with vanishing renormalized coupling constant @xmath11 ) which is ultraviolet - attractive . on the other hand ,",
    "the renormalized coupling constant runs into a landau pole at the characteristic scale @xmath12 , and perturbation theory ( around the trivial fixed point ) becomes useless in the infrared , i.e. , for energy - momentum scales of the order of and below @xmath12 .",
    "in 1978 , gribov @xcite observed that the gauge fixing procedure leading to the faddeev - popov action as described above is actually not consistent in non - abelian theories .",
    "the problem arises in the change of variables in the functional integral over the gauge field : the choice of a gauge - fixed field @xmath2 , @xmath13 , that lies on the same gauge orbit as the initial field @xmath1 , @xmath4 for an appropriate gauge transformation @xmath3 , is not unique . in other words ,",
    "there exist different gauge fields , called gauge copies or gribov copies , that fulfill the gauge condition and are , nevertheless , connected by a gauge transformation . in geometric language , the gauge orbits intersect the hypersurface defined by @xmath13 more than once",
    ".    in particular , if we look at an infinitesimal gauge transformation generated by @xmath14 , we have _ ( a^)^a_= _ a^a_+ _ d^ab_^b . [ infgaugecopies ] then it is possible to have both , @xmath1 and @xmath15 , fulfill the gauge condition if @xmath14 is a zero mode of the faddeev - popov operator @xmath16 .",
    "hence gribov s proposal to restrict the integration over the gauge field to the region where the faddeev - popov operator is positive definite , now called the ( first ) gribov region and denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "note that at the boundary of the gribov region , the ( first ) gribov horizon @xmath18 , we have that @xmath19 because the faddeev - popov operator develops a zero mode there .",
    "although gauge copies which are related by an infinitesimal gauge transformation are excluded by the restriction to @xmath17 , it is not clear that finitely related gauge copies can not exist within @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , it is now known that such copies do exist in @xmath17 , and the consequent thing to do would be to restrict the integration over the gauge fields further to a smaller region that is called the fundamental modular region @xmath20",
    ". however , the restriction to @xmath20 is very hard to implement , in numerical calculations ( lattice gauge theory with landau gauge fixing ) and even more so in analytical ( or semi - analytical ) calculations .",
    "fortunately , according to an argument by zwanziger @xcite , the difference between the restrictions to @xmath17 or to @xmath20 has no effect on the correlation functions .    for the rest of this contribution , we will hence consider the restriction of the integral over the gauge field to the gribov region @xmath17 .",
    "one of the important implications of this restriction as compared to an unrestricted integral over the gauge field , according to an argument by gribov @xcite , is the impossibility of a landau pole for the renormalized coupling constant to occur ( at a momentum scale different from zero ) . realizing the restriction to @xmath17 in an approximate way , gribov was furthermore able to predict the infrared behavior of the gluon and ghost propagators . here",
    "we will present an exact way to implement the restriction of the integral over the gauge fields which is due to zwanziger @xcite and based on gribov s ideas , and come back to the propagators later .",
    "zwanziger found a way to realize the ( heavyside ) theta functional for the restriction of the integral over the gluon field to the gribov region as a gaussian ( in the thermodynamic limit ) : _ d [ a ] = d [ a ] ( -_d^ab _ ) = d [ a ] ( - ^4 d^d x h(x ) ) , [ darestrict ] with the horizon function @xmath21 defined as h(x ) = g^2 f^abc f^cde a^b _ ^ad a^e_. for the correct normalization , the horizon condition h(x ) = 4 ( n^2 - 1 ) [ horizon ] has to be fulfilled ( in an su@xmath22 gauge theory ) .",
    "this condition fixes the new parameter @xmath23 with the dimension of mass ( in terms of @xmath12 , or vice versa ) .",
    "now @xmath21 is a complicated nonlocal functional because it contains the inverse of the faddeev - popov operator .",
    "a local form of the theory , necessary for the application of the usual quantum field theoretical machinery , can be achieved by introducing two additional auxiliary vector fields ( and the corresponding antifields ) , one of them bosonic @xmath24 and the other fermionic @xmath25 , each carrying two color indices ( in the adjoint representation ) .",
    "the gauge sector of the theory including the restriction to the first gribov region is then described by a functional integral over @xmath1 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 , and the exponential of the ( negative of the ) gribov - zwanziger action @xcite s _ & = s _ - d^d x ( _ |^ac_d^ab_^bc_- _ |^ac_d^ab_^bc_+ g f^abc _ |^ad_d^be_c^e ^cd _ ) + & - ^2 d^d x ( g f^abc a^a_^bc_+ g f^abc a^a_|^bc_+ 4 ( n^2 - 1 ) ^2 ) , [ grizwa ] see eq .",
    ". the horizon condition can be rewritten in terms of the auxiliary fields as g f^abc a^a _ ( ^bc_+ |^bc _ ) = 8 ( n^2 - 1 ) ^2 . [ horcond ]",
    "the gribov - zwanziger action leads to the tree - level gluon propagator ( in momentum space )",
    "a^a_(p ) a^b_(-q ) = ( _ - ) ^ab ( 2 ) ^d ( p - q ) , [ gluongz ] with the characteristic scale @xmath28 defined as ^4 = 2 g^2 n ^4 .",
    "[ lambda4 ] for @xmath29 , one recovers the usual ( tree - level ) ultraviolet behavior , while the propagator is heavily suppressed for @xmath30 and even tends to zero in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "the tree - level ghost propagator , on the other hand , behaves like c^a ( p ) |c^b ( -q ) ^ab ( 2 ) ^d ( p - q ) [ ghostgz ] in the infrared regime @xmath30 .",
    "the divergence in the limit @xmath31 is much stronger than for the tree - level ghost propagator in faddeev - popov theory that does not take the restriction to the gribov region into account .",
    "it is clear , then , that the effect of the restriction to the gribov region is rather drastic for the infrared behavior of the propagators .",
    "the forms and of the propagators have already been found by gribov in his approximate description @xcite .",
    "in an initially independent development , the dyson - schwinger equations of quantum chromodynamics were approximately solved in the infrared regime . as in the previous section ,",
    "we here focus on the pure gauge sector , i.e. , yang - mills theory .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations are derived from the faddeev - popov action , and the restriction to the gribov region is not implemented in any way . while this is clear from the independence of this development , the reader is justified to wonder why it would make any sense to present the solution of dyson - schwinger equations that ignore the restriction to the gribov region , when we have argued at the end of the last section that the restriction to the gribov region has a severe effect on the infrared behavior of the propagators .",
    "however , as zwanziger has clarified @xcite , the restriction to the gribov region actually leaves the dyson - schwinger equations unchanged : dyson - schwinger equations are derived from the fact that the functional integral over a ( functional ) derivative vanishes .",
    "when one restricts the functional integral over the gauge field in the faddeev - popov formulation to the gribov region @xmath17 , contributions from the boundary @xmath18 are to be expected . however , there are no such contributions in this case since the integrand vanishes on @xmath18 due to the presence of the faddeev - popov determinant as remarked earlier , and the resulting dyson - schwinger equations are the same as for the unrestricted functional integral",
    ".    solutions to the dyson - schwinger equations for the gluon and ghost propagators have been found , in a certain approximation , first in refs .",
    "the results are an infrared suppressed gluon propagator and an infrared enhanced ghost propagator as compared to the tree - level propagators of faddeev - popov theory , which is qualitatively consistent with the results and of the gribov - zwanziger framework .",
    "then , with hindsight , we can simplify the dyson - schwinger equations in the infrared regime by omitting the diagrams that contain gluon loops , or in general , in the dyson - schwinger equation for a given correlation function only keep the diagrams with the biggest number of ghost loops since the latter dominate the infrared behavior .",
    "the dominance of the diagrams with the biggest number of internal ghost propagators in the infrared regime is sometimes referred to as ghost dominance .",
    "furthermore , taylor s non - renormalization theorem @xcite allows us to replace the full ghost - gluon vertex by the bare one . that this replacement is valid to a good approximation even in the non - perturbative regime has been checked in lattice calculations @xcite . with these simplifications ,",

    "[ irds ] , and more sophisticated approximation schemes have been devised to this end @xcite .",
    "if one is exclusively interested in the extreme infrared regime , the simplified dyson - schwinger equations can even be solved analytically . in order to describe the solutions",

    "for the analytical solutions , we make power - like ansaetze for the dressing functions ( this behavior is familiar from the theory of critical phenomena ) : g(p^2 ) ( p^2)^-_g , f(p^2 ) ( p^2)^-_f .",

    "one of these solutions is _ f ( d ) = , _ g ( d ) = - [ dssol1 ] in dimension @xmath5 , for @xmath34 ( this solution is not entirely consistent in dimensions two and four due to logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "the infrared exponents of the other scaling solution have to be obtained , for general @xmath5 , from the solution of a transcendental equation . a good approximation ( within 2% error for any @xmath5 with @xmath35 )",
    "is given , however , by the simple formulae _",

    "the solutions also have in common that @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 in the first solution ) , implying that the ghost propagator diverges more strongly in the infrared than the ( faddeev - popov ) tree - level propagator , while the gluon propagator is strongly suppressed in the infrared , i.e. , it tends to zero in the limit @xmath31 , just like the tree - level propagators in the gribov - zwanziger framework .",
    "taking into account that the dyson - schwinger equations are not altered by the restriction of the functional integral to the gribov region as argued at the beginning of this section , we interpret the solutions and as ( approximately ) incorporating the quantum corrections to the tree - level results and presented in the previous section .",
    "it is also clear that the power - like behavior of the solutions can only be obtained by summing up the quantum corrections ( in some approximation ) to _ any _ loop order . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a priori not so clear which of the two solutions and is the physically relevant one for general dimension @xmath5 . also , one would like to have a systematic scheme to improve on the approximations employed in the derivation of the dyson - schwinger equations in fig .",
    "[ irds ] , and it has turned out to be very difficult to formulate such a scheme .    an important consequence of taylor s non - renormalization theorem is the natural definition of a running coupling constant as g_r^2 ( p^2 ) = ( p^2)^(d-4)/2 g ( p^2 ) f^2 ( p^2 ) g^2 . [ runncoupl ]",
    "the factor @xmath39 compensates for the dimension of the bare coupling constant @xmath40 ( the dressing functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are by definition dimensionless ) , so that @xmath41 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "then it is clear from the sum rule that the running coupling constant tends to a finite fixed point value in the infrared limit .",
    "this value can be determined analytically for the two scaling solutions and , and it turns out to vary continuously with the dimension @xmath5 .",
    "as an example , we give the ( exact ) fixed point value in @xmath42 for the second solution , = 8.915  , and mention that @xmath43 tends to zero in the limit @xmath44 for the first solution .",
    "finally , we mention that the same results have also been obtained ( in @xmath42 dimensions ) with a different technique , the functional renormalization group equations @xcite which , however , have many features in common with the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "one of the characteristic features of the scaling solutions ( including their tree - level forms , ) is the infrared enhancement of the ghost propagator .",
    "in fact , it may be shown @xcite that the horizon condition is equivalent to _ p^2 0 f^-1 ( p^2 ) = 0 , [ infdivgh ] the infrared divergence of the ghost dressing function .",
    "it is well understood by now that implementing the condition necessarily leads to the scaling solutions , be it in the tree - level form and or in the `` resummed '' form or .",
    "there is another important aspect of the gribov - zwanziger framework @xcite : the horizon condition is identical to the kugo - ojima confinement criterion @xcite which guarantees ( in faddeev - popov theory ) the existence of a global color charge that is brst - exact and hence implies confinement in the sense that all physical states are color singlets .",
    "kugo and ojima construct the physical hilbert space of non - abelian gauge theories starting from brst invariance and show the unitarity of the @xmath45-matrix @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the confinement criterion ( and hence the horizon condition ) to the infrared divergence of the ghost dressing function in the landau gauge has been shown in this framework , too @xcite .    at first sight , everything seems to fit together nicely : the restriction of the functional integral over the gluon field to the gribov region , necessary because of the existence of gauge copies in non - abelian gauge theories , leads to the horizon condition or the kugo - ojima criterion and hence to the confinement of color charges .",
    "however , there is a fundamental flaw in this argument : the brst symmetry of the faddeev - popov action can be extended to the gribov - zwanziger action only for @xmath46 , in which case the integration over the gluon field is effectively unrestricted , see eq .  .",
    "in other words , the restriction to the gribov region breaks the brst invariance on which the whole kugo - ojima construction rests .",
    "there is a simple intuitive argument that shows how the breakdown of brst invariance is an inevitable consequence of the restriction to the gribov region @xcite : the brst transformation of the gluon field has the form of an infinitesimal gauge transformation , as already remarked following eq .  .",
    "but close to the gribov horizon , an infinitesimal gauge transformation can relate gauge copies , see eq .   , and",
    "hence the transformed field falls outside the gribov region .",
    "the violation of brst symmetry is not in itself a catastrophe for the theory .",
    "many of us have grown up thinking of gauge invariance and brst invariance as synonyms , mostly because the ( global ) brst symmetry implies the slavnov - taylor identities . however , this is really only true for the faddeev - popov action and an unrestricted functional integral over the gluon field . if we restrict the intregration to the gribov region , as it turns out to be necessary in order to avoid gauge copies , the ( gauge fixed ) quantum theory is not invariant under brst transformations any more .",
    "of course , this is a serious problem for the construction of the hilbert space of the theory , just because the standard construction ( of kugo and ojima ) is based on brst symmetry .",
    "a solution to this problem has not yet been devised .",
    "but there is yet another twist to our story . with the analytical and semi - analytical predictions of the propagators in the infrared regime at hand",
    ", it seemed natural to corroborate these predictions with the help of completely non - perturbative lattice calculations .",
    "while it is not necessary ( nor natural ) to fix the gauge in these calculations , it is also not too difficult to implement the landau gauge on the lattice : for a given gauge field configuration @xmath1 , consider the functional d^d x ( a^u)^a_(a^u)^a_[gaugefunct ] for all possible gauge transformations @xmath3 , i.e. , along the gauge orbit that contains @xmath1 . then the extrema ( or saddle points ) of this functional along the orbit correspond to the fields @xmath47 that fulfill the gauge condition @xmath13 , the local minima correspond to fields @xmath2 in the first gribov region @xmath17 , and the absolute minima to fields in the fundamental modular region @xmath20 . for the huge lattices that are necessary to measure the infrared behavior of the propagators ,",
    "it is extremely difficult ( numerically costly ) to determine the absolute minimum of the functional along a given gauge orbit , however , it is relatively easy to find a local minimum and hence to restrict the gauge fields to the gribov region .",
    "the first lattice results for the propagators in the landau gauge ( with the restriction to the gribov region @xmath17 ) show a clear increase of the ghost dressing function @xmath33 towards the infrared , and a maximum and subsequent marked decrease of the gluon dressing function @xmath32 as one follows @xmath48 from the ultraviolet to the infrared , in agreement with the scaling solutions of the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "however , it was difficult to discern for a long time whether the ghost dressing function would actually diverge in the limit @xmath31 and whether the gluon propagator itself would vanish in the same limit",
    ".    meanwhile , it was discovered that the dyson - schwinger equations of the theory permit another type of solutions now known as decoupling solutions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in these solutions ,",
    "the ghost propagator is infrared enhanced only by a finite constant , i.e. , the ghost dressing functions tends toward a finite constant in the limit @xmath31 , while the gluon propagator has a finite ( nonzero ) limiting value similarly to the propagator of a massive particle .",
    "then one still has ghost dominance in the sense that the gluon propagator is infrared suppressed in comparison with the ghost propagator , and the reduction of the full dyson - schwinger equations to the approximation represented in fig .",
    "[ irds ] is justified in the infrared regime .    in terms of the infrared exponents defined in eq .",

    "furthermore , the running coupling constant defined in eq .",
    "tends to zero in the limit @xmath31 for the decoupling solutions ( for dimensions @xmath50 ) .",
    "the discovery of the decoupling solutions of the dyson - schwinger equations initiated a long and often passionate debate in the community about the true infrared behavior of the landau gauge propagators . in 2007 , at the lattice conference in regensburg , three lattice groups presented their results on the infrared behavior of the propagators in landau gauge yang - mills theory on very large lattices @xcite .",

    "the problem with this latter approach is rather of a technical nature : it appears extremely cumbersome to carry the calculations to higher orders .",
    "we finally mention an important property of the scaling as well as the decoupling solutions : all the solutions found so far violate positivity , i.e. , the spectral function in the klln - lehmann representation of the gluon propagator is not positive semidefinite implying that the gluon can__not _ _ be a physical ( massive or massless ) particle ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "for the rest of this contribution , we will describe a recent approach to the subject from a renormalization group perspective @xcite .",
    "we start from the dyson - schwinger equations of faddeev - popov theory which , as explained before , do not change when one restricts the functional integral over the gluon field to the gribov region @xmath17 . since the iterative solution of the dyson - schwinger equations generates the perturbative expansion ,",
    "the same is true for the perturbative series . on the other hand ,",
    "the ( re)normalization conditions that define the quantum theory can certainly change as a result of the restriction .",
    "one of the most important consequences of the restriction to the gribov region , as mentioned in the last section , is the breaking of brst invariance .",

    "note that a ghost mass term can not be induced for the same kinematical reasons that lead to taylor s non - renormalization theorem .",
    "we will , hence , include a gluon mass term d^d x a^a_m^2 a^a_[mass ] in the faddeev - popov action .    such an action has been considered first , as a special case among a much more general class of actions , in ref .",

    "the faddeev - popov action with a gluon mass term has also been used in a recent perturbative calculation @xcite to which we come back later . since the mass term originates from the breaking of the brst symmetry as a consequence of the restriction to the gribov region , we expect the ( renormalized ) mass parameter to be of the order of the characteristic scale @xmath12 .",
    "it is then clear that the introduction of the mass term has no important effect in the ultraviolet regime , i.e. , for momenta @xmath54 . in particular ,",
    "the value of the ultraviolet beta function is unchanged and , of course , the theory is asymptotically free .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the restriction to the gribov region is irrelevant for the perturbative expansion in the ultraviolet regime where only `` small '' fields @xmath1 contribute .",
