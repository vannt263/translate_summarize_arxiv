    "<S> quantum spin hall ( qsh ) systems , discovered @xcite after pioneering studies of time reversal invariant band insulators @xcite , are no exception in this regard . </S>",
    "<S> so far , various measurements have characterised the qsh effect from several aspects . </S>",

    "<S> non - local current measurements subsequently showed that the currents are carried via quantised edge modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarisation of these edge modes was established very recently @xcite , thereby vindicating the intuitive picture of the qsh effect consisting of two time reversed copies of the quantum hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> scanning techniques @xcite have now provided additional insights into , e.g. , inelastic scattering in the qsh systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to investigate current noise in mesoscopic structures , a central element is the quantum point contact ( qpc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies of qpcs in qsh systems have shown ways to test the properties of the helical edge states @xcite and determine interaction strengths of the edge modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> current noise studies have been performed to distinguish one - and two- particle tunnelling processes at the qpc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correlations between current noises have also been investigated to this end @xcite , as has the effect of interactions on the noise correlations of the current which is backscattered from a qpc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one question remains open , however , despite its direct experimental relevance : how do the noise correlations vary with a magnetic field that breaks the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) ? in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the topologically protected edge states are singular at zero field ; otherwise disorder becomes crucial . </S>",
    "<S> this is the question that we address in the present letter .        </S>",

    "<S> we denote the scattering amplitude for an electron coming from contact @xmath3 and going into contact @xmath4 to be @xmath5 . in previous work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that in the presence of trs : @xmath6 and @xmath7 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> all the off - diagonal entries of @xmath8 are in general non - zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate consequence of the vanishing diagonal entries of @xmath8 is that the equilibrium noise ( auto - correlation ) at each contact is universal  it is proportional to the number of open channels connected to the contact @xcite , but has no dependence on the details of the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> when trs is broken , the diagonal entries of @xmath8 become also non - zero , signifying the onset of backscattering , and the matrix @xmath8 is only subject to unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> using the scattering theory for coherent quantum transport @xcite , we can readily write down the noise correlations in terms of the scattering matrix </S>",
    "<S> . we will assume in the following the zero - temperature , zero - frequency limit .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the single - source case , namely we set @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the voltage at contact @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation noise power is then given by @xcite @xmath12 this is the partition noise caused by the splitting of the electronic beam at the qpc and it is non - positive .    </S>",

    "<S> to be specific , we set @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the current cross - correlations between the two unbiased contacts ( 3 and 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the choice of the two contacts to be biased / measured is immaterial . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the cross - correlation noise power @xmath15 contains not only the partition noise similar to eq .  , but also the exchange noise resulting from scattering of two indistinguishable electrons coming from two different contacts . </S>",

    "<S> the unitarity of the scattering matrix has been used to equate @xmath18 with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> one important implication of the above equation is : in the presence of trs , @xmath15 reaches its maximum ( zero ) as @xmath20 ; , were absent , @xmath15 would trivially be zero . </S>",
    "<S> ] when trs is broken and backscattering sets in , @xmath15 generally becomes negative . </S>",
    "<S> we call this peak in the current cross - correlations the @xmath21 peak because it is a peculiar phenomenon associated with the form of the scattering matrix of time - reversal - invariant topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that this phenomenon does not depend on the choices of biased / measured contacts , since we have made no special assumption about the contacts so far .    physically , the @xmath21 peak is a result of an exact cancellation between the partition noise and the exchange noise . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that the partition noise , due to the particle nature of electrons , is negative semi - definite , whereas the exchange noise , due to the fermionic nature of electrons , is positive semi - definite . </S>",
    "<S> the two contributions are not necessarily related in generic cases . here however , trs and current conservation together demand that the two contributions be of equal magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> similar cancellations can occur in two other circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> in one , both outgoing channels are fully occupied at a specific energy . </S>",
    "<S> this happens , for example , in a qpc based on chiral edge states @xcite where both incoming channels are fully occupied at the same energy . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the cancellation is trivial because it merely reflects the absence of current fluctuation in each channel . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a properly - timed mesoscopic two - particle collider with identical sources can lead to a cancellation of the noise correlations @xcite , as recently demonstrated in an electronic on - chip experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this case is much closer to the present case , in the sense that the currents in both outgoing channels are noisy by themselves but their correlations vanish identically due to the cancellation .    remarkably , the @xmath21 peak persists even when the incoming channels are subject to strong inelastic scattering . to model </S>",
    "<S> this scenario we employ two voltage probes that are coupled to the two incoming arms , from 1 and 2 , respectively @xcite ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> we assume the same coupling strength @xmath22 for the two voltage probes . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 is the probability for electrons in the helical channels to enter the additional reservoir connected by a voltage probe . </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing total net currents in the voltage probes require the voltage for both additional reservoirs to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 . in the strong coupling limit , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; the cross - correlation @xmath15 measures coherent contributions from the two voltage probe reservoirs instead of the original ones 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the effect of the voltage probes in this limit is only to substitute @xmath27 in eq .   by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> such a substitution obviously preserves the qualitative structure of the @xmath21 peak .     in the presence of a magnetic field and disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the setup is partitioned so that the overall scattering matrix can be obtained from combining the transfer matrices ( denoted by @xmath29 ) . </S>",

    "<S> in real experiments , transport measurements on mesoscopic devices normally display sample - dependent fluctuations when varying the magnetic field , due to disorder @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will include disorder , and , as a consequence , investigate the distribution of the cross - correlation noise power @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two major effects of the magnetic field in a generic scenario when disorder is included . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the trs - breaking scattering at the qpc ; the second one is the backscattering that may occur along each arm of the helical edge states before approaching the qpc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we generally assume that at small magnetic fields the lengths of the paths between leads and the qpc are smaller than the localisation length of the helical edge states @xcite such that the current cross - correlation is not suppressed simply by localisation . </S>",
    "<S> we will model the two effects separately , but consistently with scattering theory .    for the trs - breaking scattering at the qpc </S>",
    "<S> , a minimal model requires an additional loop of helical states inserted into the contact area between the two pairs of original edge states ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this loop is coupled to the original edge states in a point - like fashion via trs tunnelling . </S>",
