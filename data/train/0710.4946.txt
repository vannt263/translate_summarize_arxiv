    "the recent progress of the interstellar medium ( ism ) observations has established that the small and tiny scale structures of ism is very ubiquitous . historically , the initial observational target is the neutral phase of ism .",
    "indeed , the tiny scale structures are discovered by 21 cm absorption line observations against quasars with vlbi techniques @xcite .",
    "the results are confirmed by @xcite . to look for the small scale structures in the cold neutral phase of the ism furthermore",
    ", the observations of 21 cm absorption lines have been also performed against pulsars @xcite .",
    "@xcite observe optical spectral lines to find small structures against close binary stars .",
    "the images of the small - scale h i have been taken with the merlin array @xcite .",
    "these results are established by higher angular resolution observations with vlba and vla toward quasars @xcite , which show small clumps on the order of a few au in neutral galactic h i clouds .",
    "cold h i clouds have significant structure in subparsec scales @xcite .",
    "such small and tiny scale structures has been detected in the local interstellar medium as h i absorption lines , although their column density is very small @xcite .",
    "in addition to the small and tiny scale structures of h i cloud , the picture of the planetary nebula ngc 7293 shows fine small structures and knots @xcite . even in the starforming regions , there are variety small scale structures . for example , @xcite observe some clumps with size from 0.007 to 0.021 pc in the taurus molecular cloud 1 ( tmc1 ) , in particular , core d. the mass of these fragments is estimated to be @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "spitzer has begun producing higher spatial resolution mid - infrared maps @xcite , and revealed the fine structure of the starforming region .",
    "we think that it is possible for proto - brown dwarfs of @xmath3 @xmath2 to exist there . a high resolution observation in future",
    "is expected to reveal hidden , small structures , as well as substellar objects with very small mass . in any ways",
    ", the tiny - scale structure seems to be ubiquitous , not associated with large extinction @xcite .",
    "to study the origin of the small - scale structures of ism is important to understand the evolution of and structure formation in ism .",
    "especially , in the starforming regions , the small , low - mass structures can relate to the low - mass cutoff of the initial mass function , the coagulation unit to form the massive stars , and so on .",
    "then , we should investigate the physical origin of these small and tiny structures in the partially ionized medium , since the cold h i and molecular clouds are weakly ionized . by the way",
    ", it is not easy for the small and tiny scale structure to form as a result of gravitational instability since their size is much smaller than the jeans length . according to @xcite , indeed , the small - scale structures appear to be gravitationally unbound .",
    "this suggests that some fragmentation mechanisms but pure jeans gravitational instability may be important in the clouds .",
    "we expect the thermal instability as this mechanism , and revisit it in this paper .",
    "the basics of the thermal instability has been summarized in @xcite . when the following condition is satisfied ,",
    "the system is thermally unstable : if the cooling becomes efficient as the temperature decreases , the thermal energy gets lost more and more .",
    "if the cooling becomes efficient during the fluid contraction , the system shrinks on and on .",
    "importantly , the critical length scale of the thermal instability is smaller than that of the dynamical instability like the jeans instability .",
    "that is , even if a system is stable against the gravitational instability , the system can become thermally unstable .",
    "then , the thermal instability can be the physical origin of the smaller - scale formation than the dynamical instability .",
    "indeed , @xcite propose that the clumpiness in clouds emerges naturally from their formation through the thermal instability .",
    "their two - dimensional calculations follow the fragmentation into small cloudlets that result from the thermal instability in a shock - compressed layer .",
    "@xcite investigate the cooling and fragmentation of optically thin gas with a power - law cooling function .",
    "according to them , small - scale perturbations have the potential to reach higher amplitude than large - scale fluctuations .",
    "thermal instability can be important for the structure formation .",
    "we sketch ism structure formation such as molecular clouds as follows .",
    "the hot ionized ism cools to be cold and weakly ionized clouds",
    ". ionization degree of ism decreases as it evolves , and then the ism fluid is often partially ionized .",
    "in partially ionized fluid , an ion component and neutral component interact each other , exchanging the momentum ( i.e. , ion - neutral friction ) .",
    "especially , the partially ionized plasma in a magnetic field could not be treated as one fluid .",
    "this is because although the ion component in the partially ionized plasma is directly influenced by a magnetic field , the neutral component does not directly feel a magnetic field . in",
    "weakly ionized fluid , the neutral component is affected by a magnetic field via the ion - neutral friction .",
    "for example , ambipolar diffusion takes an important role in dynamical evolution owing to the gravitational instability of ism into protostar @xcite .",
    "if the fluid frozen in a magnetic field contracts without ambipolar diffusion , the magnetic field becomes too large and suppresses the growth by the magnetic pressure and tension .",
    "in addition , @xcite points out the possibility that ism with sufficient magnetic flux quasistatically evolves into protostar .",
    "he also notices that the time scale of plasma drift depends on the ionization degree .",
    "the relation among the ion - neutral friction , the magnetic field , and the amount of the ion component is important to understand the detailed process .",
    "we here emphasize that the mhd approximation is not always applicable for our purpose in this paper .",
    "the thermal instability is effective in small structure formation , during which a neutral component is not always enough frozen in an ion component dynamically to be treated as one fluid .",
    "there is a possibility that the ion component can drift away owing to ambipolar diffusion , and that the system can contract owing to thermal instability .",
    "then , in the present paper , to study how the ion - neutral drag and magnetic field influence the growth of the thermal instability , we treat the plasma as the two fluid of ions and neutrals .",
    "we assume that the ionization degree is very small , because we are interested in the final stage of the formation of a molecular cloud , in which the ionization degree decreases very much .",
    "we focus on the condensation mode of thermal instability , since it is important in structure formation , rather than the oscillation ( overstable ) mode . in  2 , the problem is formulated .",
    "the property of the dispersion relation of the instability is presented in  3 .",
    "several discussions relating to the instability are found in  4 .",
    "applicability of our results to cold h i medium is briefly examined in  5 , and then we summarize the paper in  6 .",

    ", the coefficient of thermal conductivity is expressed by @xmath15 , the gas constant by @xmath16 , and the mean molecular weight by @xmath17 .    the second terms on the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eqmotion_n ] ) and ( [ eqmotion_i ] ) mean the effect of dragging through the neutral - ion collision , similarly to @xcite .",

    "in addition , the frictional heating is also neglected as second order terms because the mutual velocity between the two components is zero in the equilibrium .",
    "we solve the perturbed basic equations , considering the first order .",
    "the unperturbed state is supposed to be infinite , uniform , static , and isothermal in equilibrium .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath35 in equilibrium can be taken as @xmath36 for simplicity .",
    "the net transfer of thermal energy for each component in equilibrium is zero , such as @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ".    someone might think our unperturbed state is inadequate since the size of the unperturbed medium is infinite .",
    "however , in our so - called wkb framework , we can state how our unperturbed condition is useful .",
    "as long as the wkb approximation is adopted , the whole of the system should be large .",
    "this can correspond to the fact that the scale length of the galactic gas disk is about 100 pc , which is always much longer than the so - called field length , @xmath0 .",
    "that is , since the interesting wave - length of the instability for the structure formation is smaller than the thickness of the galactic disk , our study is meaningful .",
    "we take the perturbation as @xmath39 according to @xcite , where @xmath40 is the amplitude of perturbation , @xmath41 is the growth rate of perturbation , and @xmath42 is the wave number of perturbation .",
    "when @xmath41 is real and positive , the perturbation grows exponentially as a condensation mode .",
    "if @xmath41 is real and negative , the perturbation damps .",
    "when @xmath41 is complex number , the system is oscillatory growing or damping .",
    "of course , when @xmath43 $ ] is positive , the system is so - called overstable .    in order to know how the magnetic field affects on weakly ionized fluid , we mainly investigate the condensation mode , because we are interested in the formation and evolution of molecular clouds .",
    "we assume that @xmath44 for comfort . due to the induction equation ( [ inductioneq ] )",
    ", these assumptions lead to @xmath45 [ see equation ( [ linear_eq_induc ] ) in appendix [ ap_del ] ] .",
    "it is emphasized that the assumed magnetic field is perpendicular to the fluid motion .",
    "here , it is noticed that we can examine some other modes , which do not satisfy the condition ( [ itijigen ] ) and ( [ itijigen02 ] ) , when @xmath46 .",
    "this means @xmath47 , owing to the induction equation ( [ inductioneq ] ) . in other words",
    ", we can study the property of the dispersion relation when the magnetic field does not work effectively .",
    "this is interesting point in our analysis since those modes with @xmath46 yield understanding of the pure effect by the ion - neutral friction .",
    "it is also noted that there is no thermal instability in a pure alfvn mode which satisfies @xmath48 , because the alfvn mode is effectively incompressible , and there is no net thermal exchange , even if the fluid is compressible .    in this paper , since we are interested in the structure formation from h i medium , the fluid is assumed to be weakly ionized , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "we also assume that temperatures of neutral and ion components are the same in the equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath50 , because they are well mixed and collide enough to have the same temperature for fewness of ion component .",

    "we set these parameters to be fixed because we are concerned for the basic nature of two - component fluid and compare the results with one - component fluid .",
    "we assume that @xmath64 , @xmath65 , for e.g. , only h atom plasma , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . under these conditions ,",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ dis - rela ] ) is evaluated for the various quantities of @xmath68 which corresponds to the strength of the magnetic field , and @xmath69 which corresponds to the strength of the friction .    before showing the precise results of the numerical dispersion relations ,",
    "we examine the physical meaning of the axis of the following figures . in each figure , the horizontal axis is the wave number @xmath70 in units of @xmath71 .",
    "the vertical axis corresponds to the growth rate @xmath72 $ ] in units of @xmath73 .",
    "these normalizations are adopted to denote the characteristic property of the thermal instability .",
    "the wavelength is taken as @xmath74 .",
    "we shall start considering the physical meaning of @xmath75 . according to equation ( [ eq : det_para_normalization_three_k_for_neutral ] ) with approximation of @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 expresses the cooling time .",
    "then , we find @xmath79 is interpreted as the distance for the fluid to acoustically move within the cooling time . in other words , it is interpreted as the length scale in which the fluid can respond to the perturbation . therefore ,",
    "regarding the horizontal axis , @xmath80 is interpreted as the scalelength in units where the fluid can respond to the thermal instability within the cooling time ( i.e. , the growing time ) .",
    "we get some physical intuition once the above normalization is adopted .",
    "for example , we get physical intuition when @xmath81 , the fluid is hard to respond to the thermal instability .",
    "this is because the system is too large and the acoustic wave which carries the disturbance can not travel through the whole system within the cooling time .",
    "then , the growth rate at @xmath82 is reduced down in each figure . when @xmath83 , the fluid is easy to respond to the thermal instability .    similarly , regarding the vertical axis , @xmath72 /k_{\\rm n \\rho } v_{\\rm sn } $ ]",
    "is interpreted as @xmath41 multiplied by the cooling time .",
    "in other word , it is interpreted as the cooling time divided by the time scale for the growth of the instability . then , the vertical axis means how fast the instability can grow up compared with the cooling time .",
    "the thermal instability is due to the cooling , then the value of @xmath72 / k_{\\rm n \\rho } v_{\\rm sn } $ ] should be less than unity as presented in each figure .",
    "figure [ b0c0 ] displays the dispersion relation of the real part of @xmath41 when there exists neither the magnetic field nor friction .",
    "a dot - dashed curve corresponds to a mode characterized by @xmath84 and a dashed one to that of @xmath85 .",
    "no friction means that the motion of the ion and neutral components are independent completely , and thus a dot - dashed curve corresponds to a single ionized fluid and a dashed one to a simple neutral fluid .",
    "the difference between the two curves comes from the mean molecular weight .",
    "this result follows @xcite .",
    "figure [ b0c003 ] shows the growth rate when there is no magnetic field but some friction [ i.e. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "this condition yields understanding of the pure effect of the friction .",
    "when there exists the friction , a pure mode of an ion component or a neutral one does not exist .",
    "therefore , interpretation is required on what a curve in the figure means when there exists the friction .",
    "the resultant modes with the friction are displays as two thick lines . for comparison ,",
    "the two thin lines when there exists neither a magnetic field nor friction in figure [ b0c0 ] are also plotted .",
    "a thick dot - dashed curve originates from an ion component mode of figure 1 .",
    "a thick dashed curve originates from an neutral component of figure 1 .",
    "these interpretations are reasonable since the effect of mean molecular weight of each component is imprinted in each dispersion relation .",
    "the difference between the figure 1 and 2 is that the growth rate at the larger scale decreases , compared with the original modes of figure 1 .",
    "this is because the suppression by the friction is more efficient at rather larger scale .",
    "the longer distance particles move , the more frequent the collision from which the friction originates is .",
    "it is noticed that the current model corresponds to the case that the fluid moves along the field line if there exists the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ b0c003 ] shows that only the friction suppresses the instability along the field line , while the magnetic field does not .",
    "figure [ b06c003 ] shows the growth rate when the friction is the same as figure [ b0c003 ] , but there is the finite magnetic field [ i.e. , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ] . for comparison ,",
    "the two thin curves which correspond to the results of figure [ b0c0 ] are also displayed , as well as figure [ b0c003 ] .",
    "a thick dashed curve is a mode , which is characterized by @xmath84 .",
    "the reason why the curve is interpreted to relating to @xmath84 is that the critical wavelength is enlarged owing to the stabilization of the magnetic field [ see the criterion ( [ crite_ion ] ) ] .",
    "that is , the magnetic field suppresses a kind of mode of the thermal instability .",
    "a thick dot - dashed curve is characterized by @xmath85 .",
    "the critical wavelength of this mode is not affected by the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the mode characterized by @xmath85 is hardly affected by the field .",
    "this occurs since the amount of the neutral component significantly dominates that of the ion component .",
    "figure [ b600c03 ] shows the growth rate when the magnetic field is thousand times of that in figure [ b06c003 ] , and friction is ten times of that in figure [ b06c003 ] [ i.e. , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the large magnetic field completely stabilizes a mode characterized by @xmath84 so that this mode does not appear in this figure .",

    "[ b600c5 ] , the friction is stronger than that in figure [ b600c03 ] , but the magnetic field is the same [ i.e. , @xmath90 , @xmath94 . for comparison ,",
    "the two thin curves are displayed like figure [ b0c003 ] . a mode characterized by @xmath84",
    "is completely stabilized , and then it disappears here .",
    "a mode characterized by @xmath85 is still unstable , while the growth rate is reduced .",
    "that is , even in weakly ionized fluid , the growth of the thermal instability is affected by the magnetic field through the friction .",
    "this decrement of the growth rate is significant at longer scale .",
    "we also confirm that the characteristic wavelength at the maximum growth rate of the instability shifts shortward as the growth rate diminishes .",
    "this occurs since the friction is effective at larger scale and the conduction is effective at smaller scale , so that the growth rate at larger scale decreases significantly .",
    "then , the characteristic wavelength at the maximum growth rate becomes small .",
    "it should be emphasized that all the critical wavelengths of the unstable mode characterized by @xmath85 are equivalent among figures [ b0c0 ]  [ b600c5 ] .",
    "the frictional terms in the right hand side of the dispersion relation ( [ dis - rela ] ) are independent of the critical wavelength for the condensation mode , as mentioned in subsection [ subsec : results : critical_wavelength ] . the critical wavelength of the mode relating @xmath85 is not changed by the magnetic field with the friction as long as the thermal conduction is not changed by the magnetic field .",
    "this point is investigated more in the following subsection [ subsec : critical_wavelength_conduction ] .",
    "we study the basic property of the thermal instability of the weakly ionized plasma in the previous sections . in this section , basing on our understanding the thermal instability , we shall discuss the structure formation .      first in this section ,",
    "the critical wavelength of the weakly ionized plasma in the magnetic field is discussed . as mentioned in section [ s_results ] , the critical wavelength of the mode relating @xmath85",
    "is not changed by the magnetic field with the friction as long as the thermal conduction is not changed by the magnetic field .",
    "in fact , the thermal conductivity is varied owing to the magnetic field . in this meaning",
    ", we may oversimplify the problem in this paper .",
    "however , the thermal conductivity will decrease as the magnetic field strength increases , and then the critical length become smaller , according to equation ( [ eq : appendix : criticallength : neutral ] ) .",
    "thermal conduction erases the temperature perturbation and thermally stabilizes the system , especially at smaller scale .",
    "the larger thermal conduction makes the critical wavelength longer , owing to the criterion [ crite_cond ] or [ crite_ion ] , according to @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the magnetic field lessens the thermal conduction of the ion component , because the ion component winds around a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we can insist that the critical length for the thermal instability of the weakly ionized plasma can not be enlarged by the friction and the magnetic field at least , while the effect of the magnetic field can influence not only the ion but the neutral component via the ion - neutral friction",
    ". this statement has universal validity for the thermal instability of the weakly ionized plasma .",
    "the effect of the friction and the magnetic field is mainly reduction of the growth rate of the thermal instability . on the other hand",
    ", the magnetic field directly enlarges the critical wavelength of the mode characterized by @xmath84 as expected in the one fluid plasma model .      in the previous section",
    ", we learn that the suppression of the thermal instability is characterized by the ion - neutral friction , strength of the magnetic field , and the direction of the field .",
    "interestingly , the suppression of the instability is different owing to the magnetic field direction .",
    "this suggests the anisotropic nature of the suppression of the instability is imprinted in the morphology of the structure . in this standing point",
    ", we shall discuss how the structure formation proceeds in the magnetized ism .      in an usual one fluid approach , the motion of the plasma parallel to the magnetic field",
    "is regarded not to be affected .",
    "however , figure [ b0c003 ] suggests that the growth rate of the thermal instability at larger scale decreases via the ion - neutral friction .",
    "this suppression of the instability yields the delay of the evolution in comparison to the evolution under the mhd approximation without the ion - neutral friction .",
    "here , we suggest that the spatial distribution of the partially ionized plasma is elongated , whose semi - major axis is vertical to the magnetic field line .",
    "figures [ b0c003 ] and [ b06c003 ] , both of which friction strengths are the same , show the feasibility .",
    "the thermal instability in figure [ b0c003 ] corresponds to the mode along the magnetic field line since @xmath95 , while that in figure [ b06c003 ] is vertical to the magnetic field line .",
    "the growth of thermal instability vertical to the line is suppressed by both of the magnetic field and the friction , while the growth along the line is suppressed only by the friction .",
    "thus , the growth rate along the magnetic field line is larger than that vertical to the line , and then the resultant morphology of the structure via the thermal instability is elongated .",
    "we insist the growth rate depending on the direction of the field results in the morphology of interstellar structure .",
    "furthermore , we learn in  3 the mode characterized by @xmath84 are stabilized by the friction and field , while that by @xmath85 can grow as found in figure [ b06c003 ] .",
    "figure [ b600c5 ] shows that although the mode characterized by @xmath84 is completely stabilized , the mode characterized by @xmath85 is still unstable .",
    "consequently , we can insist that the neutral component condenses owing to the thermal instability , while the ion component still keeps spreading .",
    "it is noticed that the ion component may condense since it is dragged by the neutral component contracting owing to the thermal instability",
    ". however , once the distribution of the ion and the neutral components separates and the motion of the two becomes independent there , the ion component in the area is thermally stable owing to the magnetic field .",
    "this means the magnetic pressure lets the ion component be spread in the area even if the neutral component condenses .",
    "this thin ion component left behind by the contracting neutral component will be observed as a halo around h i clouds , and it emits , especially some forbidden lines .",
    "this halo possibly has wide distribution vertical to the magnetic field , as discussed in subsubsection [ sss_spread_of_part ] .",
    "this is because the ion component can condense , parallel to the magnetic field like the neutral .",
    "the magnetic pressure can not prevent the motion of the ion component efficiently as found in figure [ b0c003 ] .",
    "thus , the morphology of the ion halo is also elongated according to the orientation of the field line .",
    "it is suggested that there are small clumpy structures of ism .",
    "here , we examine whether the clumpiness originates via the thermal instability .",
    "according to figures [ b600c03 ] and [ b600c5 ] , the growth rate of the thermal instability of partially ionized plasma depends on the strength of the friction .",
    "the scale length at the maximum growth rate of the instability becomes smaller , owing to the suppression via the friction which is effective at larger scale .",
    "thus , we can expect the small clumpiness appears selectively via the thermal instability since the ion - neutral friction suppresses the large scale condensations .",
    "if we are interested in the small clumpiness of ism , we should mention about the thermal conduction in relation to the magnetic field . according to subsection [ subsec : critical_wavelength_conduction ]",
    ", the small clumpiness may the results of the decrement of the conduction .",
    "it is noticed that the conduction along the field line is not so affected , and then there is still ambiguity for the reduced conduction coefficient to perform the key role for the origin of the small clumpiness .",
    "it is also noticed that the thermal instability is a slow process relative to the dynamical processes .",
    "if molecular clouds form from the h i medium via the gravitational instability , the small clumpiness inside the molecular clouds appears after the formation of the clouds .",
    "this trend is enhanced if the effects of the magnetic field and friction are concerned .",
    "this is because the friction and the field suppress the large scale growth , while the short wavelength modes are still unstable . in a enough long span for the growth",
    ", the tiny structures can appear in ism and affect the evolution of its structure especially as the non - linear effects .",
    "thus , if we want to know how faint and small structures come to be observable , the growth time - scale of the thermal instability should be precisely examined . at this time , we never forget the effect of the magnetic field and the ion - neutral friction .",
    "the modes in figures [ b600c03 ] and [ b6000c03 ] have similar growth rate , while the magnetic fields are significantly different in each other .",
    "it implies that the suppression of the growth by increasing the magnetic field with the fixed friction has limits . by the way , a dispersion relation of only ionized fluid in a magnetic field , which is derived by equalizing the second bracket on the left - hand side in equation ( [ dis - rela ] ) to be zero ,",
    "is reduced to @xmath96 when @xmath70 approaches @xmath97 .",
    "this is solved to be @xmath98 thus , we find that this solution is independent of a magnetic field . even if the magnetic field becomes strong , the value of the growth rate at @xmath99 is scarcely changed , where the friction is more effective than at small wavelength . therefore , once the effect of the friction is fixed , increasing the magnetic field strength beyond a threshold level apparently becomes ineffective for the suppression of the growth .",
    "not only information of the magnetic field but the friction is necessary to investigate the evolution of the thermal instability of the weakly ionized plasma",
    ".      the formulation of the fully one component plasma can not be always applicable to study the thermal instability of weekly ionized plasma .",
    "this is because there is the growing mode even when there exist the magnetic field and friction , whose growth rate is comparable to that of the neutral component when there are no magnetic field and friction .",
    "indeed , this trend is found from the comparison among figures [ b06c003 ] , [ b600c03 ] and [ b6000c03 ] .",
    "in addition , regarding weakly ionized plasma including the friction effect , the friction does not change the critical wavelength @xmath100 .",
    "the friction tends to efficiently reduce the growth at much larger scale than the @xmath100 .",
    "this feature yields that the critical wavelength in the weakly ionized plasma is not changed by the magnetic field via the friction , as mentioned in section [ s_results ] and subsection [ subsec : critical_wavelength_conduction ] .",
    "even if the magnetic field becomes strong , only the growth rate is reduced , keeping the critical wavelength constant .",
    "this is also the difference from the simple analysis of the one component magnetized plasma .",
    "the previous study of the one component plasma shows the stabilization at the smaller scales , while the current study insist @xmath100 is unchanged even if the effect of the field is concerned .",
    "in this section , we shall study the origin of the small scale structure of h i cloud as an example .",
    "the thermal instability of the typical h i region with c ii cooling is briefly discussed here .",
    "we assume that the temperature of h i is @xmath101 k. the fluid mainly consists of h atom , and then @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",

    "we assume that interstellar pressure is about @xmath109 erg @xmath110 .",
    "then , if the ism is in equilibrium under the pressure of @xmath109 erg @xmath110 , the number density of the neutral component @xmath111 and the magnetic field strength @xmath112 are about @xmath113 @xmath110 and about @xmath114 gauss , respectively .",

    "in addition , we assume that @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
