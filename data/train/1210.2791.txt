    "by stirring a cup of water its temperature is increased . when kneading a bread dough it gets warmer .",
    "these basic facts are common in our daily life and are a simple manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics at work . in fact",
    ", the second law of thermodynamics states that for almost any dynamical process ( stirring , kneading , etc . )",
    "the entropy of the system needs to increase .",
    "the increase in entropy is usually associated with heating which we experience through our senses .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics can be rigorously proven microscopically if the initial state of the system is stationary , i.e. the initial density matrix is diagonal in the energy basis , and the probability distribution of occupying different energy states is a decreasing function of energy ( so called passive density matrices )  @xcite .",
    "then , as a result of any dynamical process , the energy of the system can only increase or stay the same .",
    "this is exactly the thompson s formulation of the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "similarly , with a single assumption of the initial state being stationary , one can prove that the properly defined entropy increases or stays constant  @xcite .",
    "even more generally without any assumption on the initial state , it can be proven that the entropy and energy ( for positive temperature states ) increase in time for systems subject to random forces .",
    "these systems include the famous fermi acceleration problem , where a charged particle increases its energy by being repeatedly reflected by a magnetic mirror  @xcite , the boltzmann s dynamics of particles experiencing repeated and uncorrelated collisions  @xcite , particles moving in a chaotic time - dependent cavity  @xcite and many others . in all previous examples",
    "it was assumed that there were no correlations between subsequent collisions . in quantum language",
    "this lack of correlations is equivalent to relaxation to the diagonal ensemble  @xcite and it is sometimes referred to as `` energy measurements ''  @xcite .    the applicability of the second law becomes much less clear if there are correlations between subsequent dynamical processes , like in the case of systems which are driven periodically in time . in these systems",
    "one can observe the phenomenon of dynamical localization , where the energy of the system never exceeds a maximum bound .",
    "examples of dynamical localization include the fermi - ulam model of a particle bouncing off a periodically moving wall  @xcite , classical and quantum kicked rotors  @xcite , and the kapitza pendulum  @xcite .",
    "it is generally expected that this localization phenomenon is peculiar to small integrable systems . in chaotic ergodic systems",
    "the periodicity of the driving should not matter because such systems effectively serve as their own heat bath , which in turn can be viewed as a source of a random langevin type noise .",
    "thus , it is generally expected that the energy of a periodically driven ergodic system will steadily increase in time .",
    "this belief though is entirely based on intuition and there is no guarantee that it is generally correct .",
    "moreover , using the example of the many - body localization transition , it has been convincingly argued that disordered interacting systems can behave non - ergodically  @xcite and the standard assumption that the interacting non - integrable system can serve as its own bath can fail .",
    "furthermore , for driven interacting systems it was recently noticed numerically that periodic modulation , even with a long period , leads to suppression of energy and entropy growth  @xcite compared to a a similar modulation with a random period . however , it was not clear whether this suppression simply leads to a slower heating rate or to the localization .",
    "the purpose of this work is to argue that there is a new type of localization transition in periodically driven systems as a function of the driving period .",
    "we demonstrate this transition both analytically and numerically and argue that it is related to a breakdown of short time ( magnus ) expansion of the evolution operator . for short periods",
    "the expansion is convergent leading to the effective time - independent many - body ( floquet ) hamiltonian and the energy is localized . for long periods",
    "this expansion breaks in the thermodynamic limit leading to the delocalization transition and heating of the system to the infinite temperature .",
    "these expectations are consistent with the recent experimental findings on a ac - driven electron glass @xcite . in this experiment , the energy absorbed by the electrons from the ac - driving ,",
    "is related to the variation in the conductance which can be directly measured and it is convincingly shown that at high frequency ( short period ) the electron glass does not absorb energy .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the critical frequency is set by the electron - phonon interactions and it is much lower than the maximum rate of energy exchange which is set by electron - electron interactions .",
    "finally , we will show a strong evidence for this transition using examples of classical and quantum interacting spin systems .",
    "before addressing the many - particle problem we will discuss a much simpler example of a periodically driven system , the so called kapitza pendulum  @xcite and show how the magnus expansion can be used to derive the effective potential .",
    "the kapitza pendulum is a classical rigid pendulum with a vertically oscillating point of suspension ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kapitza ] ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the kapitza pendulum reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the angle measured from the downward position ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kapitza ] ) , @xmath2 is the frequency of small oscillations and @xmath3 are the amplitude and frequency of the driving of the point of suspension : @xmath4 .",
    "this dynamical system has an extremely rich behavior containing both regions of chaotic and regular motion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . for our purposes",
    "we consider the limit of small driving amplitude @xmath5 and describe how the dynamical behavior qualitatively changes _ as a function of the driving frequency_.    for a small amplitude drive the lower equilibrium at @xmath6 remains stable unless particular parametric resonance conditions @xmath7 with @xmath8 , are met  @xcite .",
    "as we increase the frequency of the external drive from @xmath9 we observe qualitatively different regimes .",
    "first the motion in phase space is completely chaotic and both the lower and upper equilibrium ( @xmath10 ) are unstable , then the lower equilibrium becomes stable while the upper equilibrium remains unstable , finally when @xmath11 both the upper and lower equilibrium are stable .",
    "the surprising phenomenon that the upper position becomes stable ( and the pendulum performs oscillations around this inverted position ) is known in the literature as dynamical stabilization and was first explained by kapitza .",
    "he showed that for small amplitude and high frequency driving the dynamic of the driven pendulum can be accurately described by a _ time - independent effective hamiltonian _",
    ", moreover the effective potential energy develops a local minimum at @xmath12 when @xmath11 explaining the oscillations around the inverted position .",
    "usually the dynamical stabilization is obtained by splitting the degrees of freedom into fast and slow modes , eliminating the fast modes , and obtaining the effective potential for the slow modes  @xcite .",
    "this procedure has a limitation that it can not be easily extended to either interacting systems or to the quantum domain .",
    "it is also unclear whether averaging over fast degrees of freedom will lead to the hamiltonian equation of motion in each order of the expansion .",
    "here we show that the dynamical stabilization phenomenon can be understood through the magnus expansion of the quantum evolution operator in powers of the inverse frequency ( a relate perturbative analysis in powers of the inverse frequency was studied in @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of this method is that allows us to analyze behavior of the periodically driven interacting systems .",
    "let us now start by reviewing the basis aspects of the magnus expansion  @xcite ( me ) ( for an excellent review see ref .",
    "this expansion equally applies to quantum and classical systems , but it is more convenient to use the language of quantum mechanics .",
    "we imagine that the system is prepared initially in some quantum - mechanical state @xmath13 , which evolves in time under some periodic hamiltonian @xmath14 with a period @xmath15 .",
    "then if we look stroboscopically into the system at times @xmath16 its wave function will be given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the evolution operator during one period of oscillation : @xmath19 here the time ordering exponent implies that the later times in the integral always appear on the left . since the evolution operator is unitary it can be always represented as the exponent of some hermitian operator , which we can identify with the effective floquet hamiltonian @xmath20 . @xmath21",
    "the problem of finding the floquet hamiltonian is thus equivalent to the problem of evaluating the logarithm of a time - ordered exponential .",
    "for some simple noninteracting hamiltonians it is actually possible to find the floquet hamiltonian explicitly and this was recently used to predict new topological states of light and atoms  @xcite .",
    "but in general it is a very hard problem with no closed form solution because the hamiltonian at different times does not commute with itself . unlike in statistical physics",
    "this problem remains equally hard even in the classical limit because of the singular factor @xmath22 in the exponent .",
    "a possible root to compute the floquet hamiltonian is to expand the evolution operator in taylor series in the period @xmath15 and then take the logarithm of this taylor series .",
    "the corresponding me  @xcite is guaranteed to converge for finite - dimensional hamiltonians and sufficiently short periods . in thermodynamic",
    "limit the convergence of the me can not be proven in general .",
    "this situation is very similar to the high - temperature expansion in statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "usually the breakdown of the high temperature expansion is an indication of a phase transition .",
    "for simple few body systems there are many physical situations where the me converges quickly to the exact floquet hamiltonian and only few terms are necessary to describe the dynamics .",
    "for this reason the me found many applications in different areas of physics and mathematics ( see the review  @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the first two terms in the me read : @xmath23 .",
    "\\end{array}\\label{magnus}\\ ] ] higher order terms have a similar structure containing higher order commutators .",
    "they are multiplied by higher powers of the period and hence the period of the driving plays the role similar to the inverse temperature in the high temperature expansion . for classical systems",
    "the equivalent expansion can be obtained by substituting the commutators between the operators with the poisson brackets : @xmath24/{i\\hbar } \\to \\{\\dots\\}$ ] .    in the case of the kapitza pendulum",
    "it is sufficient to compute the first three terms in the me ( see appendix [ appendix - kapitza ] ) , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "they read : @xmath26 we point that up to this order , the me is the same for quantum and classical pendulum . here , the first term is simply the time averaged hamiltonian , which reduces to the hamiltonian of the non - driven pendulum .",
    "the second term is zero .",
    "actually it can be shown that for symmetric protocol ( @xmath27 ) all even terms in the me are identically equal to zero  @xcite .",
    "the third term @xmath28 is the first nontrivial contribution to the floquet hamiltonian , which is sufficient to explain the dynamical stabilization of the pendulum found by kapitza .",
    "indeed in the limit @xmath29 the floquet hamiltonian describes a pendulum moving in the effective potential @xmath30 .",
    "it is easy to see that this potential develops a new minimum at the inverted position , @xmath12 when the condition @xmath31 is met .",
    "moreover one can check that the higher order terms in the me remain small as long as this condition is met . when the period of the external driving is increased ( the frequency is reduced ) higher order terms in the me",
    "need to be computed to accurately describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "if the period is increased even further there is no guarantee that the me converges to the effective floquet hamiltonian . in this regime",
    "we observe that the motion of the pendulum becomes chaotic  @xcite .",
    "recently the dynamical stabilization of an interacting quantum system , conceptually similar to the kapitza s case described here , has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite . in this experiment , using a time - periodic protocol , the internal spin dynamics of a multi - component spinor condensate is stabilized and the region of stability computed using the time averaged hamiltonian compares favorably with the experimental results .",
    "we suspect that the inclusion of higher order terms in the magnus expansion could further improve the agreement between the theoretical calculations and the experimental results .",
    "in the rest of the paper we will focus an @xmath32 interacting classical and quantum spin models with periodic boundary conditions which is driven by periodically quenching between two different hamiltonians , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "although we believe that our results are general and not limited @xmath32 situations , we prefer to keep the discussion focused on this specific system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] we show two equivalent descriptions of the same protocol .",
    "the left panel represents the actual time dependent sequence of pulses switching between the two hamiltonians . on the right panel we depict an equivalent protocol where instead we are performing a single quench to the floquet hamiltonian and then a quench back to the original hamiltonian @xmath35 at the time of measurement .",
    "the second quench is not necessary , it highlights the fact that we do the measurements of observables like energy with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath35 .     and @xmath34 and ( right ) single quench from @xmath33 to the effective floquet hamiltonian @xmath20 and back to @xmath33.[fig : protocol ] ]    without loss of generality we can choose the hamiltonian @xmath35 to be a simple precession in the external magnetic field and the hamiltonian @xmath36 to be interacting and ergodic : @xmath37 where , we have defined the shorthand notations : : @xmath38 let us point that this system is invariant under space translation and @xmath39 around the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) . for numerical calculations we choose the following parameters : @xmath44 .",
    "we checked that our results are not tied to any particular choice of couplings .",
    "as pointed out earlier , we can expect two qualitatively different regimes depending on the period of the driving . at long periods",
    "the system has enough time to relax to the stationary state between the pulses and thus is expected to constantly absorb energy until it reaches the infinite temperature .",
    "this situation is similar to what happens for driving with random periods  @xcite . on the contrary",
    "if the period is very short we can expect that the floquet hamiltonian converges to the time averaged hamiltonian . since the whole time evolution can be viewed as a single quench to the floquet hamiltonian ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] ) we expect that the energy will be localized even in the infinite time limit as long as the floquet hamiltonian is well defined and local . noticing that the commutator of two local extensive operators is local and extensive we see from eq .",
    "( [ magnus ] ) that the floquet hamiltonian is local and extensive in each order of me and the dimensionless expansion parameter in the me is a product of the period of the driving and the coupling constants ( this is in analogy with the high temperature expansion in thermodynamics in which the inverse temperature takes the role of the period of the driving ) .",
    "thus the question of whether the energy of the system is localized in the infinite time limit or reaches the maximum possible value is tied to the question of convergence of the me . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there are no statements in the literature about this convergence in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore we will rely on the specific spin model to establish that for short driving periods the me indeed converges and the energy of the system is localized while for longer periods this expansion diverges and the systems is heated towards infinite temperature .    for the quantum system",
    "we consider a spin-@xmath45 chain initially polarized along the @xmath46-axis , which is the ground state of @xmath33 .",
    "we then compute the time evolution operator by exact diagonalization of the two hamiltonians @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "translational invariance of the system allows us to restrict the analysis to the zero momentum sector and analyze chains with the number of spins up to @xmath47 , which contains @xmath48 states . for the system of classical spins",
    "we numerically integrate the bloch equations derived from the hamiltonians   using the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "we took the initial conditions which maximally mimic the wigner function of the quantum chain , namely @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a uniformly distributed random variable .",
    "the advantage of quantum systems is that it is straightforward to exactly obtain the infinite time limit of the evolution by projecting the initial state to the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian , while the advantage of the classical systems is that one can analyze significantly larger system sizes .      in fig .",

    "the location of the singularity is also manifestly independent of the system size . as it is seen from the numerical simulations ( fig .",

    "this small discrepancy , which is non - extensive and thus vanishes in thermodynamic limit , is caused by the fact that the entropy is not a linear function of the density matrix and can be fully explained by a more careful analysis @xcite .",
    "finally we note that for long periods the fluctuations in the time - series of the both observables ( excess energy and diagonal entropy ) are suppressed .",

    "we show the time evolution of the excess energy for different values of the pulse times @xmath62 and @xmath68 .",

    "the diagonal entropy serves as a measure of the occupation of the hilbert space . for short periods",
    "it remains bounded at all times and for long periods , up to small sub - extensive corrections , approaches the value expected for a completely delocalized ( i.e infinite temperature ) state .",
    "we associate the delocalization transition with the divergence of the short time me for the effective floquet hamiltonian similarly to the divergence of the high - temperature expansion in statistical physics . in this sense",

    "the physical reason is that , for an unbounded spectrum , the periodic driving can generate excitation of arbitrarily high energy , @xmath122 , ( corresponding to the absorption of quanta of the driving frequency ) which are not described by the effective time - independent hamiltonian .",
