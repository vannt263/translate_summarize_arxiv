    "consider an infinite dimensional linear control system @xmath4 where the state y(t ) belongs to a reflexive banach space x , the control u(t ) belongs to a reflexive banach space u , @xmath5 is an operator , and b is a control operator ( in general , unbounded ) on @xmath6 .",
    "discretizing this partial differential equation by using , for instance , a finite difference or a finite element scheme , leads to a family of finite dimensional linear control systems @xmath7  where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 .",
    "if the control system ( 1 ) is controllable in time t then there exists a solution @xmath12 of ( 1 ) associated with a control @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "as known , we have many available methods in order to identify the controllability .",
    "we refer to j .- l .",
    "lions @xcite for a well - known method in attainning the control of the minimal @xmath2 norm- the so called hum ( hum stands for hilbert uniqueness method ) . in this work",
    ", however , we investigate a method which we can achieve the minimization procedure in @xmath0 norm @xmath15 .",
    "namely , we will establish some conditions ensuring the existence and convergence of the discretized control of the minimal @xmath0 norm @xmath16    necessary conditions for optimal control in finite dimensional state space were derived by pontryagin et al @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum principle as a set of necessary conditions for optimal control in infinite dimensional space has been studied by many authors . since it is well known that the maximum principle may be false in infinite dimensional space , there are still many papers that give some conditions to ensure that the maximum principle remains true .",
    "it was li and yao @xcite who used the eidelheit separation theorem and of the uhl s theorem in order to extend the maximum principle to a large class of problems in infinite dimensional spaces when the target set is convex and the final time t is fixed .",
    "additionally , the authors of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , by making use of ekeland s variational principle , give some conditions on the reachable set and on the target set in order to get an extension of maximum principle .",
    "nevertheless , the problem is that when we applied the result of @xcite , @xcite for the system ( 1 ) in the case the final state and final time are fixed , the finite - codimensional condition in @xcite , @xcite does not satisfy for the system ( 1 ) in general .",
    "hence we can not use maximum principle in our problem .",
    "fortunately , thank to the fenchel - rockafellar duality theorem which is used in the same manner in @xcite , @xcite , the constrainted minimization of the function can be replaced by the unconstrainted minimization problem of corresponding conjugate function .",
    "therefore , we will consider the above minimization procedure in the same framework with @xcite .",
    "the uniform controllability is an important area of control theory research and it has been the subject of many papers in recent years .",
    "the main goal of this article is to establish conditions ensuring a uniform controllability property of the family of discretized control systems ( 2 ) in @xmath0 and to establish a computationally feasible approximation method for identifying controllability .",
    "it is well known that controllabilty and observability are dual aspects of the same problem .",
    "we therefore will focus on the uniform observability which is shown to hold when the observability constant of the finite dimensional approximation systems does not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "some relevant references concerning this property has been investigated by many authors in series of articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for finite difference schemes ,",
    "a uniform observability property holds for one - dimensional heat equation @xcite , beam equation @xcite , schrodinger equations @xcite , but does not hold for 1-d wave equations @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the discrete dynamics generates high frequency spurious solutions for which the group velocity vanishes that do not exist at the continuous level . to overcome these high frequency spurious for wave equations",
    ", @xcite showed some remedies such that tychonoff s regularization , multigrid method , mixed finite element and filtering of high frequency , etc .    to our knowledge , in 1-d heat equation case , due to the fact that the dissipative effect of the 1-d heat equation acts as a filtering mechanicsm by itself and it is strong enough to exclude high frequency spurious oscillations@xcite . however , the situation is more complex in multi - dimensional .",
    "the counter - example is shown in @xcite for the simplest finite difference semi - discretization scheme for the heat equation in the square .    in recent works in @xmath2-norm , by means of discrete carleman inequalities , the authors in @xcite , @xcite obtain the weak uniform observability inequality for parabolic case by adding reminder terms of the form @xmath18 which vanishes asymptotically as @xmath19 . moreover , as in @xcite , the approximate controllability is derived from using semigroup arguments and introducing a vanishing term of the form @xmath20 for some @xmath21 .    in fact , an efficient computing the null control for a numerical approximation scheme of the heat equation is itself a difficult problem .",
    "accoding to the pioneering work of carthel , glowinski and lions in @xcite , the null control problem is reduced to the minimization of a dual conjugate function with respect to final condition of the adjoint state . however , as a consequence of high regularizing property of the heat kenel , this final condition does not belong to @xmath2 , but a much large space that can hardly be approximated by standard techniques in numerical analysic .",
    "recently , a. munch and collaborators have developed some feasible numericals such that the transmutation method , variational approach , dual and primal algorithms allow to more efficiently compute the null control ( see in series @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the discretization framework in this paper is the same spirit as @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite , under standard assumptions on the discretization process and for an exactly null controllable parabolic system ( 1 ) , if * the degree of unboundedness of the control operator is lower than 1/2 * then the semidiscrete approximation models are uniformly controllable and they also showed that for the ( 2 ) , the minimizing of the cost function of discretized control with power @xmath22 is obtained .    in this article",
    ", we prove the existence of the minimum of the cost function of discretized control power @xmath23 @xmath1 for type ( 2 ) , in the case the operator a generates an analytic semigroup .",
    "of course , due to regularization properties , the control system ( 1 ) is not exactly controllable in general",
    ". hence , we focus on exact null controllability . our main result , theorem 3.1 , states that for exactly null controllable parabolic system ( 1 ) and under standard approximation assumptions , if the discretized semigroup is uniformly analytic , and if * the degree of unboundedness of the control operator b with respect to a is greater than 1/2 * , then a uniform observability inequality in ( @xmath24 ) is proved .",
    "we stress that we do not prove uniform exact null controllability property for the approximating system ( 2 ) .",
    "moreover , a minimization procedure to compute the approximation controls is provided .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review some well - known facts on controllability of linear partial differential equation in reflexive banach spaces . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the existence and unique solution of the minimization problem in continuous case . by making use of the fenchel - rockafellar duality theorem",

    "the main result is stated in section 4 and proved in section 5 .",
    "an example of application and numerical simulations are provided in section 6 , for the one - dimensional heat equation with dirichlet boundary control .",
    "an appendix is devoted to the proof of a lemma .",
