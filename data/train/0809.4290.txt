    "the production of top quark pairs at the fermilab tevatron provides us with an opportunity to perform a large variety of measurements related to the production and decay mechanisms of the top quark and many of its properties .",
    "given the large integrated luminosity available at the tevatron many of these measurements are no longer limited by statistical uncertainties .",
    "consequently , it is possible to test the standard model ( sm ) in the top quark sector with high accuracy and to detect deviations that could be caused by new physics .",
    "new physics could reveal itself in many ways , by altering the production cross section , the top quark decay modes , the top quark mass distribution or the coupling constants , etc .",
    "the signature of new particles can be similar to or exactly the same as that of @xmath0pairs .",
    "this motivates to look for signs of new physics using the same tools and analysis strategies developed for measurements in the top quark sector . in the following",
    "we will describe four examples : searches for particles decaying into @xmath0 , searches for the supersymmetric partners of top quarks , a search for top - like objects @xmath1 , and a search for the production of a light sm higgs boson in association with a pair of top quarks .",
    "the analyses are based on up to 3  @xmath2of data collected by the cdf and dexperiments .",
    "several theories beyond the sm predict new @xmath4-like particles that decay into a pair of top - quarks , causing a peak in the @xmath0invariant mass distribution .",
    "such resonances could occur as kaluza - klein states of the @xmath4 or the gluon , in axigluon models or theories with top color .",
    "both cdf and dhave searched for narrow resonances @xmath5 assuming that the width is smaller than the detector mass resolution  @xcite .",
    "final states where one top quark decays hadronically ( @xmath6 ) and the other one semileptonically ( @xmath7 ) have been considered ( `` @xmath8 '' final state ) .",
    "the cdf analysis is based on approximately 1  @xmath2of data and reconstructs the @xmath9 distribution in events with at least four jets from the jet - parton assignment that is most likely to come from @xmath0events .",
    "the most consistent combination is found by minimizing a @xmath10 which is constructed from the reconstructed @xmath11 boson and top quark masses , and using additional information from @xmath12-tagged jets .",
    "no structure from a resonant signal is observed in the @xmath0mass spectrum over the expected contributions from sm @xmath0and non-@xmath0backgrounds and limits are set on the production cross section times branching ratio @xmath13 for @xmath4-like resonances . for the specific case of topcolor leptophobic models a @xmath5 with a mass below 720  gev is ruled out at the 95% cl .",
    "d s search is based on a data set of 2.1  @xmath2 in the @xmath8 final state requiring at least one @xmath12-tagged jet .",
    "no attempt is made to match partons to jets , and the invariant @xmath0mass is calculated directly from the four - momenta of up to four leading jets , the charged lepton momentum and the neutrino momentum .",
    "the neutrino @xmath14 component is calculated from the @xmath11 mass constraint @xmath15 .",
    "the advantage of the direct reconstruction is that it allows to include events with only three jets .",
    "this recuperates sensitivity to events from a high mass @xmath5 where merging of two jets into a single jet due to the relativistic boost occurs more often . with the data describing the mass shape expected from sm background only ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d0_zprime ] ) , a @xmath5 mass below 760  gev for topcolor - assisted technicolor models is excluded at the 95% cl .",

    "parameters space in the cdf search for massive gluons .",

    "]    cdf has also searched for new color - octet particles ( massive gluons ) that decay into @xmath0 in 1.9  @xmath2of data  @xcite .",
    "the model introduces three new parameters , the coupling strength @xmath17 , the mass @xmath18 and the decay width @xmath19 of the heavy gluon . the @xmath8 final state with at least one @xmath12-tagged jet",
    "is reconstructed using the _ dynamical likelihood method _  @xcite but omitting information from the matrix element of the process to avoid a bias towards specific model assumptions . without an observed excess over the sm background",
    ", limits are set on the coupling @xmath17 for massive gluon widths from @xmath16 to @xmath20 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cdf_zprime2 ] for an example ) .",
    "the decays of the supersymmetric partners of the top quark , @xmath21or stop quark , could lead to the same final state signature as that from sm top quarks . some models like electroweak baryogenesis scenarios favor stop quarks that are lighter than the top quark .",
    "if the superymmetric parameter space is further constrained by assuming that @xmath22 so that the stop quark decays exclusively into @xmath23 and assuming that @xmath24 is the lsp and that @xmath25 are heavy then the @xmath26 final states involving @xmath12 quarks , one or more leptons , missing transverse energy , and jets are identical to the sm top - pair decays in the @xmath27+jets or dilepton final states .",
    "hence , contributions from stop pairs could be contained in the presumed top - quark pair data .",
    "cdf searched for signs of stop quarks using 2.7  @xmath2of data  @xcite in the final state where both charginos decay into @xmath28 , mimicking the @xmath0signature in the dilepton final state . due to the undetected two neutralinos and two neutrinos ,",
    "the stop quark mass can not be reconstructed directly . instead , the mass is estimated using the neutrino weighting method  @xcite and the reconstructed mass is used as a discriminant in the limit setting procedure .",
    "cdf sets limits on the @xmath29 parameter space for several values of the @xmath30 mass .",
    "an example for @xmath31 and various assumptions about the branching ratio @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf_stop ] .",
    "a similar search has been performed by dusing 1  @xmath2of data but in the @xmath27+jets final state  @xcite .",
    "the chargino and neutralino masses are fixed close to their experimental lower limits .",
    "several input variables are combined into a likelihood discriminant whose distribution is used to extract the stop - pair signal .",
    "the 95% cl limits on the cross section are show in fig .",
    "[ fig : d0_stop ] .",
    "the observed limits are a factor of 712 higher than the theoretical prediction .",
    "the possibility of new top - like objects from a massive fourth generation of quarks has been studied by cdf based on 2.8  @xmath2of data  @xcite .",
    "such objects are predicted by various models , for example little higgs or beautiful mirrors scenarios .",
    "assuming that the mass of the new @xmath1 is larger than the top quark mass and that @xmath33 so that @xmath34 exclusively , a template fit method based on a minimal @xmath10 to find the correct combination of parton - jets assignment is used to set limits on the @xmath1 mass .",
    "no @xmath12-tagging is applied to avoid making assumptions about the coupling of the @xmath1 to the sm quark sector . both the reconstructed @xmath1 mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf_tprime1 ] ) and the scalar sum @xmath35 of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed objects in the event show good discrimination between the signal , the @xmath0and other backgrounds .",
    "a two - dimensional likelihood fit to these variables is applied to extract the amount of signal that would be allowed by the data . using this information ,",
    "limits are set on the production rate @xmath36 as a function of @xmath37 , see fig  [ fig : cdf_tprime2 ] .",
    "an analysis of the data in the high @xmath35 and reconstructed @xmath37 tails of the 2d distribution show that no significant excess of data over the background predictions is observed . by comparing the observed cross section limit to the expected signal cross section , a @xmath1 with a mass smaller than 311  @xmath38is excluded .",
    "production as a function of the @xmath1 mass . ]",
    "the production of a sm higgs boson in association with a top quark pair will be the only direct way to measure the top yukawa coupling at the lhc . in the mass region @xmath39 the dominant higgs boson decay mode is @xmath40 which in the @xmath41 final state for the top quark pair leads to the challenging signature of one high @xmath42 lepton , large missing transverse energy and up to 6 jets of which four are @xmath12 jets .",
    "the @xmath43cross section at the tevatron is very small ( about 7  fb for @xmath44 ) and observation of a higgs boson in this channel alone is not possible .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath43channel can contribute to the total discovery or exclusion potential of the tevatron .",
    "dhas searched for @xmath45 in 2.1  @xmath2of data  @xcite . to increase the sensitivity ,",
    "the analysis has been divided into events with four and at least five jets and with one , two , or three @xmath12-tagged jets .",
    "the distribution of the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the up to five leading jets , @xmath35 , shows good discrimination between the @xmath43signal and the backgrounds and is used in the limit setting procedure .",
    "the largest signal contribution is expected from events with five jets and at least three @xmath12-tagged jets .",
