    "the hydrodynamic models run with a relatively simple treatment of radiative transfer may then be post - processed with more detailed radiative transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "roughly in increasing order of sophistication , the hydrodynamic models consist of solving the : shallow water equations @xcite , equivalent barotropic equations @xcite , primitive equations @xcite , euler s equations @xcite , or the full navier stokes equation @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have combined approaches 1 and 2 by simultaneously solving the radiative transfer _ and _ hydrodynamical equations . with the exceptions of the hydrodynamical models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , as well as the radiative transfer models of @xcite ,",
    "however , these theoretical efforts have been directed towards understanding exoplanets on circular orbits , for which the planet s power budget is constant .    despite the difficulties in numerically modeling exoplanet atmospheres , the physical parameters that govern their large - scale behavior are thought to be : the radiative timescale ( how quickly a parcel of gas radiates away its thermal energy ) , and the advective timescale ( how long it takes for a parcel of gas to move from the planet s day - side to its night - side ) . in detail , not",

    "the radiative timescale is primarily determined by the depths at which incident energy from the host star is being absorbed and emitted ( which are not necessarily the same ) .",

    "such wind speeds lead to advective times of @xmath6  s for a jupiter - sized planet . since the radiative and advective timescales are of the same magnitude , it is not immediately clear how efficient energy recirculation should be for short - period exoplanets . indeed",

    "we define this constant effective rotation period for the planet , @xmath8 , in an inertial frame .",
    "note that from the perspective of a parcel of gas , it does nt matter whether this motion is a result of actual rotation of the planet , winds , or both .",
    "winds are usually defined with respect to a rotating core .",
    "it is difficult ( currently impossible ) to determine the rotation rate of a gaseous exoplanet s core , @xmath9 .",
    "observationally , the only accessible quantity is the sum of the planet s internal rotation and the winds , which we refer to as the planet s effective rotation : @xmath10 .",
    "note that the effective rotation of the planet can be trivially converted to an effective rotational period , @xmath11 , or an equatorial parcel velocity in an inertial frame , @xmath12 .    for the energy budget of the parcel of gas , what matters is not the rotation frequency but rather the related _ advective _ frequency , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the angular velocity of the planet about its host star , which varies with time for an eccentric orbit .",
    "the advective frequency is a measure of how often the parcel of gas is subjected to stellar forcing .",
    "a planet with a tidally locked _ _ atmosphere _ _ has @xmath15 ; super - rotating winds ( in the same sense as the planet s orbital motion ) have @xmath16 ; sub - rotating winds have @xmath17 .",

    ", we will often express @xmath8 in units of @xmath20 since this immediately indicates whether the planet s atmosphere is super - rotating or trailing when its day - side is receiving the largest incident flux .",
    "the flux incident on a planet changes as a function of time if the planet s orbit is not circular : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the star s effective temperature and radius , and @xmath25 is the planet ",
    "star distance .",
    "we assume that parcels of gas move only in the e  w direction , not latitudinally , and we adopt the lagrangian approach of tracking an individual parcel of gas and its temperature .",
    "the flux absorbed by the parcel is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the planet s bond albedo ( which we assume to be constant ) , @xmath28 is the co - latitude of the parcel ( @xmath29 at the north pole , @xmath30 at the equator , and @xmath31 at the south pole ) , and @xmath32 is the angle from the sub - stellar longitude ( a.k.a . local time : @xmath33 at the dawn terminator ; @xmath34 at the substellar meridian ; @xmath35 at the dusk terminator ; @xmath36 at the antistellar meridian ) .",
    "we further assume that all of the heat absorbed by the parcel goes into increasing its temperature , rather than doing mechanical work .",
    "the warmed gas then radiates as an ideal blackbody with temperature @xmath37 ( this is simply newtonian cooling , a scheme used in many of the hydrodynamic simulations listed in   1 ) .",
    "the differential equation governing the temperature of this parcel of gas as a function of time is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is constant everywhere on the planet , provided that the mass - density , @xmath40 , specific heat capacity , @xmath41 , and the thickness of the parcel , @xmath42 are planet - wide constants .",
    "since all the incident flux is absorbed ( and eventually re - radiated ) in a single layer , one must take this layer to be many atmospheric scale - heights thick : including the optical and infrared photospheres .",
    "note that even if the dynamical layer of the atmosphere is a dozen scale heights thick , it is still much smaller than the planetary radius .    setting the left side of equation  [ de ] to zero , we define the equilibrium temperature for a parcel of gas : @xmath43 a parcel cools if its temperature is greater than @xmath44 ; it heats up if its temperature is below @xmath44 .",
    "the temperature extrema of the parcel ( and any inflection points ) thus occur when its temperature reaches @xmath44 .",
    "note that latitude enters the differential equation in the same way as bond albedo .",
    "this means that locating a parcel farther from the equator is precisely equivalent to increasing its bond albedo : @xmath45 .",
    "the energy budget of an eccentric planet is dictated by what happens near periastron .",
    "noting that the time variability of @xmath44 is contained in @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we define the fiducial temperature along the sub - stellar meridian at periastron ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "numerically , but in the remainder of this section we consider simplifying limits that offer insight into the model behavior .",
    "readers primarily interested in the calculated light curves may skip ahead to   4 .",
    "the limiting case of @xmath59 corresponds to a planet where all the flux is re - radiated from the day - side , regardless of how rapidly the gas parcels are moving .",
    "every parcel of gas in such a case is always right at its equilibrium temperature : @xmath60 , given by equation  3 .    given our model assumptions , the @xmath61 limit corresponds to a planet that emits radiation uniformly at all longitudes . for a planet on an eccentric orbit ,",
    "the limit comes in two varieties : if @xmath62 , the planet instantly re - radiates all incident energy , but uniformly in longitude .",
    "this may be thought of as a planet with strong zonal winds , leading to efficient day  night heat circulation : @xmath63 if @xmath64 , the radiative time is so long that one probably can not neglect latitudinal ( meridional ) transport ; it is expedient to assume perfect latitudinal transport .",
    "the planet will emit uniformly everywhere on the planet and at the same rate all the time : @xmath65      in the special case of circular orbits ( the majority of short - period exoplanets , for good reason ) , there are many useful analytic approximations that we can make to simplify the problem .",
    "furthermore , the simpler circular case offers intuition into the behavior of our model . in the circular limit , equation  [ dimensionless ] can be rewritten as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a dimensionless constant quantifying the planet s energy recirculation efficiency .",

    "note that we have included the @xmath69 factor in the y - axis , so that we may plot on the same figure the heating curves for parcels at different latitudes .",
    "the two effects of a high @xmath70 are 1 ) a delay in the time of maximum temperature , and 2 ) higher night - time temperature .",
    "although the observed light curve depends on both the radiative and advective timescales , the heating pattern of a parcel of gas depends only on their ratio , @xmath70 .",
    "the night - time temperature is largely independent of latitude , @xmath28 , but depends sensitively on @xmath70 .",
    "the maximum temperature reached by a parcel , on the other hand , depends sensitively on its latitude but only weakly on @xmath70 .",
    "because of the equivalency of latitude and albedo , the the dashed lines in figure  [ heating ] can be thought of as the heating curves for equatorial parcels of gas , but with @xmath71% : albedo has a more important impact on the day - side heating pattern than on the night - side cooling . finally , the delay between a parcel passing through the sub - stellar longitude and reaching its maximum temperature , @xmath72 , depends more sensitively on @xmath70 than does the maximum temperature reached , @xmath73 . in the @xmath74 limit , @xmath75 , as one would expect from equation  [ dimensionless ] .",
    "the diurnal heating patterns shown in figure  [ heating ] are similar to those measured at the surface of earth . in both cases parcels of gas move in and out of the sunlight : on earth this motion is entirely due to the planet s rotation ( wind velocities are small compared to rotational velocity ) , while on a gaseous planet this motion is due to a combination of rotation and zonal winds .",

    "the temperature extrema are therefore related to their location on the planet by : @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath72 are the angles between the sub - stellar meridian and temperature minimum and maximum , respectively . since @xmath81 is typically much less than unity , @xmath82 in most situations",

    "this asymmetry manifests itself in the disc - integrated thermal phase curve of the planet : the offset in the peak of the lightcurve tends to be larger than @xmath72 .    in the appendix",
    "we develop analytic approximations in the circular regime for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( the maximum temperature reached by a parcel , its temperature at the dusk terminator , and at the dawn terminator ) .",
    "those analytic approximations are compared to the numerical solutions in figure  [ t_sunset_vs_epsilon ] . for intermediate recirculation efficiencies , @xmath92 ,",
    "the sunset temperature has a peak .",
    "this is due to advection of heat downstream , which becomes more efficient as @xmath70 increases , heating the sunset terminator .",
    "however , when @xmath70 becomes too large , heat is distributed uniformly along a given longitude , causing the temperature to decrease again , hence the peak at intermediate @xmath70 .     at the hot - spot , at dusk and at dawn , as a function of recirculation efficiency , @xmath70 .",
    "the lines show the analytic expressions presented in the appendix , while the point symbols show the result of numerically solving equation  [ dimensionless ] .",

    "by combining the energy transport model described above with a geometrical model of the planet s motions ( both orbital and rotational ) , we now produce model phase variations for an entire planet .",

    "we can run the calculations for arbitrary wavelengths but only present here the light curves for _ spitzer _ irac channel 4 ( 8  @xmath98 m ) . since ours is a one - layer model ,",
    "the shape of the phase variations is essentialy unchanged if one adopts a different waveband .",
    "the only free model parameters are @xmath27 , @xmath58 , and @xmath8 ; in practice we set @xmath99 since the albedo does not significantly affect the _ shape _ of the thermal phase variations and it appears that hot jupiters have low albedos ( * ? ? ?",

    "this discrepancy is largely due to our implicit assumption of no internal heat : after spending over 100 days far from its host star , our model planet cools to @xmath140  k. this is still much hotter than the remnant heat of formation ( 50100  k ) , but cooler than the 720  k night - side equilibrium temperature used for the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .",

    "- zero heat capacity reduces the maximum contrast ratio and increases the minimum , making for a flatter light curve . furthermore , the phase amplitude generally diminishes for larger advective frequencies : the peak - to - trough amplitude is smaller for @xmath143 than for @xmath144 across the board . for planets with @xmath125 ,",
    "however , a second order effect may also take place : the light curve maximum _",
    "increases _ for moderate @xmath58 as this allows the planet to hold onto absorbed power until its hot - spot has rotated into our view ( see figure  [ sample_hd17156 ] ) .",
    "short - period exoplanets on circular orbits should have tidally locked cores , because the tidal locking timescale is considerably shorter than the age of most planetary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "by the same token , planets on eccentric orbits should have cores in pseudo - synchronous rotation ( roughly speaking , this means being tidally locked at periastron , when the tidal forces are strongest ) .",
    "unlike detailed hydro simulations that use the planet s rotation rate as an input parameter , our model is agnostic about precise prescriptions for pseudo - synchronous rotation frequency , @xmath145 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , at a moderate eccentricity of @xmath146 , the @xcite formulation gives @xmath147 , while the @xcite formulation gives @xmath148 .",
    "these details about the planet s interior are not important for our purposes , however , because the planets in our study have thick gaseous envelopes covering their cores and hydrodynamic simulations indicate that wind - speeds in the vicinity of the photosphere are comparable to the rotational velocity . as a result ,",
    "the parcels of gas are probably not stationary with respect to the sub - stellar point , even for ( presumably tidally locked ) planets on circular orbits . as a first - order model",
    "we treat them as advecting longitudinally at a constant angular velocity .",
    "tidal circularization is undoubtedly responsible for the generally low eccentricity of short - period planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , that tidal heating has an observable effect on light curves .",
    "for example , @xcite calculate present - day tidal heating between @xmath149 and @xmath150  w for gl  436b , two orders of magnitude less power than the stellar insolation , which ranges between @xmath151 and @xmath152  w. for short - period planets , the observational signature of internal heat ( either remnant gravitational energy from formation or ongoing tidal heating ) will likely be an inflated radius rather than additional emergent flux . if hot jupiters exist for which the tidal heating is a sizeable fraction of the insolation , then our model will have under - estimated the zeroeth - order ( dc ) component of their lightcurves . by the same token",
    ", we also neglect the remnant heat of formation , which is likely less than 100  k for a gyrs - old planet @xcite .",
    "one important consequence of neglecting any internal heating and having a simple one - layer model , is that the night - side equilibrium temperature is zero . for the most part",
    "this is not important , since parcels pass through the illuminated hemisphere often enough to never get very cool .",
    "the exception is for our models of hd  80606b , where the planet spends such a long time ( @xmath153 days ) far from its host star .",
    "it is possible that the real planet never cools to the 400  k seen in our toy model .",
    "our model neglects conduction of heat from one cell to its neighbors .",
    "as such , our model is only relevant when advection and radiation are the dominant energy transport mechanisms .",
    "this is probably the case for hot jupiters , which are thought to have strong winds .",
    "if heat conduction _ is _ important on hot jupiters , then they may exhibit smaller day  night temperature contrasts and the relation between the thermal phase offset and the thermal phase amplitude will be broken ( see first equation  12 ) .",
    "our model assumes that all the incident energy from the host star is either reflected or absorbed , and the energy that is absorbed only goes into increasing the temperature of the parcels of gas . in effect , this amounts to neglecting the work term in the first law of thermodynamics . in the steady - state , the power absorbed by the planet must be balanced by the power emitted .",
    "that is to say , the ultimate effect of work is to warm up parcels of gas ( e.g. , parcels speed up to super - sonic velocities , shock and deposit energy as heat ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implicitly neglects four effects that may very well be occurring : energy may instead go into latent heat to vaporize particulates ; thermal tides @xcite ; increasing the atmospheric scale height @xcite ; or speeding up winds .",
    "any of these `` work '' terms would tend to dampen the temperature fluctuations experienced by a parcel of gas : they act as energy sinks near periastron and may act as energy sources near apoastron . as such our model will under - estimate gas response time , over - estimate the temperature excursions , and hence the peak - to - trough amplitude of disc - integrated lightcurves .",
    "the planet most likely to show these effects is hd  80606b , since realistically much of the energy absorbed at periastron must go into speeding up winds , inflating the atmosphere , etc .",
    "indeed , the peak - to - trough phase amplitudes we compute for this planet are roughly a factor of 2 greater than those from hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "our toy model neglects advection towards the planet s poles : effectively we have zonal but no meridional winds . at low ( mbar ) pressures , there almost certainly is meridional flow away from the sub - stellar point , but the low presures mean that only a small fraction of absorbed power is moved in this way .",
    "but even when meridional flows are not efficient , latitudinal heat transport may still occur in the form of eddy fluxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we have also implicitly neglected .",
    "efficient equator  pole heat transport on a planet would have the effect of reducing the dc component of the phase curve . in the limit of perfect latitudinal heat transport ,",
    "the equatorial temperature is suppressed by a factor @xmath154 and the disc - integrated temperature is only suppressed by @xmath155 compared to the nominal ( no latitudinal transport ) case .",
    "this latitudinal dilution is ( necessarily ) smaller than the longitudinal dilution .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , latitudinal energy transport is only important for exoplanets that are not edge - on ( we get a better view of their pole ) , and in those cases the unknown planetary radius is a confounding factor .    our model uses a single angular wind velocity , which can roughly be thought of as the velocity of the equatorial jet stream .",
    "we are neglecting the jet - streams at mid - latitudes that transport energy in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that to first order the velocity of the equatorial jet is the only speed that affects the observed phase variations of a planet , but the speed of waves may also be important ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in any case , our @xmath8 can be thought of as the visibility - weighted mean of the competing zonal jets , which is necessarily slower than the velocity of the equatorial jet .",
    "note that our adoption of constant _ angular _ velocity amounts to solid body rotation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as far as simplifications go , solid - body rotation is attractive because it naturally produces smaller linear velocities near the planet s poles than near the equator , a generic feature of many hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "that being said , the assumption is undoubtedly wrong in detail and one could instead parameterize the zonal flow as having a constant _ linear _ rather than angular velocity : @xmath156 .",
    "such a parameterization could be normalized to yield the same overall heat transport , but it would smear out thermal phase curve features , since parcels of gas flash - heated at periastron would not move in lockstep across the face of the planet .",
    "we assume that the wind speed does not change with time .",
    "the existence of steady - state , e - w jet streams is supported by hydrodynamic simulations of planets on circular orbits ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "but the simulations of @xcite and @xcite indicate that these results may be a function of initial conditions , in which case even planets on circular orbits may exhibit wandering equatorial jets . for planets on eccentric orbits ,",
    "the wind speed of the equatorial jet may very well slow down as the planet s energy budget decreases , but the timing of the primary peak should only depend on the wind speed near pericenter .",
    "if the winds damp out near apastron , then the maximum wind velocity may occur shortly after periastron , depending on the inertia of planet s atmosphere . in effect , our model works in the limit of large inertia , so that the winds do not speed up or slow down even as the planet s energy budget changes .",
    "there is very little energy to transport when the planet reaches apoastron , so the wind speed at that point in the orbit does not have observable consequences .",
    "atmospheric albedo is thought to increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "this can be quite sudden if , for example , clouds form high in the atmosphere ( eg , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the formation of clouds on an eccentric planet as it moves away from periastron will simply exacerbate its @xmath157 energy budget , making the periastron passage even more important for thermal light curves .",
    "note that this is the only of our model assumptions that could lead us to _",
    "under_-estimate the amplitude of phase variations .    while we treat the parcels of gas as blackbody emitters , the _ shapes _ of our lightcurves should not change much if the planet has a non - blackbody spectrum .",
    "the shape of the light curves is preserved provided that the mid - ir flux increases as a simple function of temperature .",
    "this is likely to be true on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the planet s spectral energy distribution .    using a single temperature at each position on the planet ( ie : a single - layer model )",
    "implicitly means assuming that the temperature at the emitting surface is roughly equal at all wavelengths of interest . in the case of highly irradiated planets , the day - side temperature - pressure profile is shallower than for an isolated giant planet .",
    "depending on how much advection of heat occurs and at what depths this may not be true of the night - side .",
    "observationally , the day - side brightness temperatures of hot jupiters often differ from one infrared waveband to another .",
    "but the only hot jupiter with thermal phase curves observed at multiple wavelengths is hd  189733b , and the _ shape _ of the 8 and 24 micron phase curves are indistinguishable , given the uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this is notable since 1-d atmospheric models of this planet place the 8  micron photosphere at more than twice the pressure of the 24 micron photosphere .",
    "note that this coincidence for hd  189733b only means that the _ ratio _ of the radiative and advective times is the similar at the 8 and 24 micron photospheres .",
    "for eccentric planets the degeneracy between those two timescales is broken , so seeing the same morphology at two different wavebands means that _ both _ the radiative and advective timescales are the same at the two photospheres . if the phase variation morphology is grossly different from one waveband to another , then one would need a model with different radiative and advective times as a function of waveband ( or equivalently , a multi - layer model ) .",
    "we have presented a semi - analytic model for the heating pattern of gas in the atmosphere of a hot jupiter .",
    "our two physically - motivated parameters are the planet s radiative timescale , and its wind speed .",
    "this model is meant to calculate the shape of thermal phase variations of transiting exoplanets with any eccentricity or argument of periastron .",
    "we have assumed zero albedo and blackbody - like emission throughout : these assumptions have an effect on the dc offset of our phase variations ( e.g. , the secondary eclipse depth ) , but should not significantly affect the shape of the phase variations ( timing of the phase peak , peak - to - trough amplitude , etc . ) .",

    "<S> in general , increasing the advective frequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak - to - trough amplitude of phase variations , but there are interesting exceptions to these trends . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer than their radiative time exhibit `` ringing '' whereby the hot spot generated at periastron rotates in and out of view . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of ringing makes it possible to directly measure the wind speed ( the frequency of the ringing ) and the radiative time constant ( the damping of the ringing ) . </S>"
