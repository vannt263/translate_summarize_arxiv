    "tunable optical lattices have been extensively used to study phase transitions in bosonic atomic gases  @xcite , since they allow the controlled manipulation of the particle density @xmath3 , and of the ratio between the particle transfer energy @xmath4 , and the interparticle interaction strength @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this kind of control is not fully present in standard fermionic condensed matter systems , and has hindered the development of experiments that could probe systematically the effects of strong correlations as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , fermionic atomic gases like @xmath7 and @xmath8 have been succesfully trapped , and their normal state and superfluid properties are beginning to be studied  @xcite . because of",
    "the greater tunability of experimental parameters , novel superfluid phases may be more easily accessible in the experiments involving ultracold atomic gases .",
    "for instance , single hyperfine state ( shs ) ultracold atomic systems are ideal candidates for the observation of novel triplet superfluid phases and for testing theoretical models that were proposed earlier .",
    "thus , it is only natural to propose that optical lattices could be used to study the normal state and superfluid properties of ultracold fermionic systems as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath6 and lattice symmetry .",
    "these systems are of broad interest not only for the atomic physics community but also for the nuclear , condensed matter and more generally for the many - body physics communities , where models for superfluidity have been investigated in various contexts .",
    "the interaction between induced dipole moments of atoms and the electric field of laser beams is used to trap atoms , particularly alkali atoms , in optical lattices .",
    "alkali atoms have only one electron ( @xmath9 ) out of closed shells .",
    "this electron is in a zero orbital angular momentum @xmath10 channel , and its total angular momentum @xmath11 gives @xmath12 .",
    "the nuclear angular momentum @xmath13 and electron angular momentum @xmath14 are combined in a hyperfine state with total angular momentum @xmath15 which gives @xmath16 for alkalis .",
    "furthermore , the electron and nuclear spins are coupled by the hyperfine interaction that splits the atomic levels in the absense of magnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "a weak magnetic field causes zeeman splitting of the hyperfine levels @xmath18 with different @xmath19 , which can be made to correspond to pseudo - spin labels .",
    "trapping one  @xcite , two  @xcite , three  @xcite and four  @xcite hyperfine states were considered by several authors .",
    "however , it is also known that trapping more hyperfine states increases the number of channels through which the gas can decay . therefore , trapping one or two hyperfine states of ultracold fermionic gases is experimentally more plausible .    for paired identical fermions",
    ", the pauli exclusion principle requires the total pair wave function to be anti - symmetric .",
    "the total orbital angular momentum should be odd for pseudo - spin symmetric pairs and even for pseudo - spin anti - symmetric ones .",
    "therefore in the case of trapping two hyperfine states ( ths ) , @xmath1-wave scattering of atoms between fermions from different hyperfine states is dominant .",
    "thus , one expects that the superfluid ground state of such two - component fermi gases to be @xmath1-wave and pseudo - spin singlet .",
    "presently there is experimental evidence that @xmath20 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath7 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) can form weakly and tightly bound atom pairs , when the magnetic field is swept through an @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance .",
    "however , the properties of shs ultracold fermions and their possible superfluid behaviour are beginning to be investigated  @xcite .",
    "these systems are probably the next frontier for experiments with ultracold atoms . when identical fermionic atoms are trapped in a single hyperfine state , the interaction between them is strongly influenced by the pauli exclusion principle , which prohibits @xmath1-wave scattering of atoms in identical pseudo - spin states . as a result ,",
    "in shs degenerate fermi gases , two fermions can interact with each other at best via @xmath0-wave scattering .",
    "thus , one expects that the superfluid ground state of such shs fermi gases to be @xmath0-wave and pseudo - spin triplet .    in the @xmath0-wave channel ,",
    "if the atom - atom interactions are effectively attractive then the onset for the formation of cooper - pairs in three dimensions occurs at a temperature  @xcite @xmath21 $ ] in the bcs regime , where @xmath22 is the fermi energy and @xmath23 is the @xmath0-wave scattering length . unfortunately",
    ", this temperature is too low to be observed experimentally .",
    "however , in the presence of feshbach resonances  @xcite , @xmath0-wave interactions can be enhanced , and the critical temperature for superfluidity is expected to increase to experimentally accessible values .",
    "on the other hand , we show that the pseudo - spin triplet ( @xmath0-wave ) weak coupling limit in optical lattices ( like in the singlet case  @xcite ) may be sufficient to produce a superfluid critical temperature that is accessible experimentally .",
    "furthermore , several interesting superfluid properties can be investigated in @xmath0-wave systems as the system is tuned from the bcs to the bec regimes  @xcite . in this paper , we address superfluid properties of ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices for both shs @xmath0-wave and ths @xmath1-wave states as a function of atom filling factor , interaction strength , temperature and lattice symmetry .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] , we discuss the effective action method and the saddle point approximation for a lattice hamiltonian with attractive interactions in the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave channels . we also derive the order parameter , critical temperature and number equations in the saddle point approximation and discuss pseudo - spin triplet states in the @xmath24-vector formalism in this section . in sec .",

    "finally , a summary of our conclusions is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this manuscript , we consider quasi - two - dimensional optical lattices with a periodic trapping potential of the form @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , which strongly suppresses tunneling along the @xmath27 direction .",

    "since the paper was divided into two parts , we present our conclusions for each of these parts separately .",
    "in the first part , we analysed superfluid properties of shs @xmath0-wave and ths @xmath1-wave symmetries in the strictly weak coupling bcs regime . there",
    ", we calculate the order parameter , chemical potential , critical temperature , atomic compressibility , and superfluid density as a function of filling factor for tetragonal and orthorhombic optical lattices .",
    "we found that , for shs @xmath0-wave superfluids , the critical temperatures in tetragonal and orthorhombic optical lattices are considerably higher than in continuum model predictions , and therefore , experimentally attainable .",
    "in particular , we showed that a small anisotropy in the transfer energies increases the effective density of fermionic states of an shs @xmath0-wave superfluid considerably around half - filling which leads to higher critical temperatures .",
    "in contrast , a small anisotropy decreases the density of states around half - filling , and therefore , the critical temperatures for an ths @xmath1-wave superfluid .",
    "we also noticed that further anisotropy leads to a larger decrease in critical temperatures for ths @xmath1-wave than for shs @xmath0-wave superfluids .",
    "therefore , we concluded that a small anisotropy favours shs @xmath0-wave pairing near half - filling , and that the critical temperatures for shs @xmath0-wave superfluids are comparable and even higher than ths @xmath1-wave case for similar interaction parameters .    for shs @xmath0-wave superfluids , we found a peak in the isothermal atomic compressibility at low temperatures , exactly at half - filling of tetragonal lattices .",
    "this peak splits into two smaller peaks in the orthorhombic case .",
    "these peaks reflect the shs @xmath0-wave structure of the order parameter at low temperatures and they are related to the nodes ( zeros ) of the quasi - particle energy spectrum .",

    "the peaks turn into humps at @xmath259 .",
    "in contrast , for ths @xmath1-wave superfluids , we showed that the atomic compressibility does not show a peak structure at low temperatures since the quasi - particle energy spectrum is always gapped , and that the compressibility is largely temperature independent .",
    "we also discussed the superfluid density tensor for shs @xmath0-wave and ths @xmath1-wave systems . in the shs @xmath0-wave case , we concluded that in orthorhombic lattices , the off - diagonal component @xmath303 of the superfluid density tensor vanishes identically , while the diagonal components @xmath311 and",

    "we discussed the changes in the quasi - particle excitation spectrum , chemical potential , atomic compressibility , momentum distribution and cooper pair size as a function of filling factor and interaction strength for tetragonal and orthorhombic optical lattices .",
    "we found major differences between shs @xmath0-wave and ths @xmath1-wave superfluids in the evolution from bcs to bec regime .    in the case of shs",
    "@xmath0-wave superfluids , the quasi - particle excitation spectrum , chemical potential , atomic compressibility , cooper pair size and momentum distribution are not smooth functions of filling factor or interaction strength . in particular , the singular behavior of the atomic compressibility suggests the existence of a quantum phase transition when the chemical potential crosses the bottom or the top of the energy band .",
    "this transition is associated with the change in quasi - particle excitation spectrum and the higher angular momentum nature @xmath399 of shs @xmath0-wave superfluids , which are gapless in the bcs regime , but fully gapped in the bec regime .",
    "in contrast , for ths @xmath1-wave superfluids , the quasi - particle excitation spectrum , chemical potential , atomic compressibility , cooper pair size and momentum distribution are smooth functions of filling factor or interaction strength .",
    "in particular , the smooth behavior of the atomic compressibility suggests only a crossover when the chemical potential crosses the bottom or top of the energy band .",
    "this crossover is associated with a fully gapped quasi - particle excitation spectrum and pairing at the zero angular momentum channel in both bcs and bec regimes .",
    "these major differences between ths @xmath1-wave and shs @xmath0-wave superfluids in an optical lattice suggest that shs @xmath0-wave cold atoms are much richer than ths @xmath1-wave cold atoms , and thus these systems may provide a new experimental direction in this field .",
