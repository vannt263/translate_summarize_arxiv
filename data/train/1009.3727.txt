    "solitons describe a class of fascinating nonlinear wave propagation phenomena appearing as a result of balance between nonlinearity and dispersion or diffraction properties of the medium under nonlinear excitations , which leads to undistorted propagation over extended distance @xcite .",
    "one of the most important physically relevant realizations of solitons is provided by the matter - wave solitons in bose - einstein condensed atomic gas @xcite .",
    "based on the successful experimental realization and theoretical analysis of bose - einstein condensations ( becs ) in weakly interacting atomic gases @xcite , matter - wave dark solitons  @xcite , vortices  @xcite , bright solitons  @xcite , gap solitons  @xcite , and soliton chains  @xcite have been observed and studied .",
    "these studies have stimulated a large amount of research activities , which enable the extension of linear atom optics to nonlinear atom optics @xcite .",
    "the realization of higher - dimensional matter - wave solitons in becs is still a challengeable topic because those solutions are usually unstable for ( 2 + 1)-d and ( 3 + 1)-d constant - coefficient nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation due to the weak and strong collapse @xcite .",
    "however , different situations are observed in becs with temporally or spatially modulated parameters .",
    "alteration of atomic scattering length achieved by feshbach resonance @xcite has been used to dynamically stabilize higher - dimensional bright solitons @xcite while periodic external potentials achieved by optical lattice has been used to generate and control higher - dimensional gap solitons @xcite .",
    "1d periodic wave solutions are also predicted in becs with time - space varying parameters @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bright solitons  @xcite and periodic wave solutions  @xcite were obtained in spinor becs governed by a system of three coupled mean - field equations .    in this work",
    ", we present a detailed study on dynamics of _ analytical 3d bright matter - wave single solitons and soliton - pairs _ in becs with time - space modulation .",
    "we note that 3d periodic wave solutions have been studied in the generalized nls equation very recently @xcite .",
    "however , the authors did not study the soliton pair solutions and their interaction properties . by using the similarity  @xcite and bilinear transformations  @xcite",
    ", we can achieve different shapes of bright solitons and fascinating interactions between two solitons .",
    "in addition , the experimental possibilities for observability are discussed and the stability of solitons is illustrated numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the model under study",
    "is introduced . in sec .",
    "iii , the methods for solving the model equation are introduced . a relationship between the model and a practical system",
    "is established . in sec .",
    "iv , we give the expressions of the bright solitons and the soliton - pairs .",
    "the interactions between two solitons are also investigated . in the last section , the case of the dark solitons",
    "is discussed and the outcomes are summarized .",
    "the dynamics of a weakly interacting bose gas at zero temperature is well described by the ( 3 + 1)-d gp model with time - space modulation  @xcite    l [ gpe ]",
    "i = + i(t ) ,    where @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 denotes the order parameter with @xmath3 being the number of atoms in the condensate , @xmath4 is the interaction function with @xmath5 being the @xmath6-wave scattering length modulated by a feshbach resonance , and @xmath7 is the gain / loss term , which is phenomenologically incorporated to account for the interaction of atomic or thermal clouds .",
    "we note that the dissipative dynamics originating from the interaction between the radial and axial degrees of freedom has also been studied recently  @xcite . here",
    "the potential is chosen as a harmonic trap @xmath8 with @xmath9 being a diagonal matrix of the trap frequencies in three directions and @xmath10(@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) corresponding to its center .    using the suitably scales and variables : @xmath14 ,  @xmath15 , @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath17",
    ", we arrive at the dimensionless gp equation in the ( 3 + 1)-d space after dropping the primes    l [ dgp ]",
    "i = + i(t ) ,    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and [ v ]    l v(t,*r*)=(*r*-*e*(t ) ) * * ^2(t)(*r*-*e*(t ) )    with @xmath20 . eq . ( [ dgp ] ) is associated with @xmath21 in which the lagrangian density can be written as    l = i(^*_t-^*_t)+||^2 -g(t)||^4 -2[v(t , * r*)+i(t)]||^2 .",
    "here we focus on the spatially localized bright solitons and soliton - paris for which @xmath22 .",
    "our first objective is to reduce eq .",

    "we explore the attractive nonlinearity , i.e. @xmath26 , resulting in the bright multi - soliton solutions .",
    "the case @xmath27 resulting in the dark multi - soliton solutions does not pose new challenges and will be discussed in the last section . using the similarity transformation  @xcite [ tr ] ( t,*r*)=(t)e^i(t,*r*)((t ) , ( t,*r * ) ) , and requiring @xmath28 to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) and @xmath29 to be the solution of eq .",

    "( [ v ] ) , after some algebra it follows from system ( [ sys ] ) that the similarity variables can be expressed as [ variable ]    l ( t,*r*)=(t ) + ^t_0(s ) ( s)ds , ( t)=^t_0 |(s)|^2ds ,    where @xmath31 denotes the vector of the inverse spatial widths of the localized solutions along @xmath32 directions , respectively , and @xmath33 with @xmath34 relating to the velocity of the solitons",
    ". moreover the nontrivial phase has the quadratic form [ phase ]    l ( t,*r*)=- a(t ) * r*+-^t_0(*e*^2*e*+||^2)dt ,    where @xmath35 . the additional relations between @xmath36 and @xmath37 result in the mathieu equations [ condition ] _ j(t)+_j^2(t)_j(t)=0 , ( j=1,2,3 ) .",
    "finally , the function @xmath38 modulating the amplitude of solution @xmath39 and nonlinearity @xmath40 can be also found by [ non ]    l ( t)=_0[_1(t)_2(t)_3(t)]^1/2 , g(t)=-^-2(t)|(t)|^2 ,    which depend on both @xmath41 and gain / loss coefficient @xmath42 with @xmath43 being a non - zero parameter .",
    "note that for the given @xmath41 , the nonlinearity @xmath40 must _ attenuate _ ( _ grow _ ) exponentially in the _ gain _ ( _ loss _ ) medium @xmath44 .    for the given @xmath36 , one can , in principle , obtain corresponding @xmath41 ( or equivalently for the given @xmath41 one can obtain @xmath36 ) based on eq.([condition ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the bright @xmath45-soliton solutions of eq.([nls ] ) can be obtained using the bilinear transformation  @xcite : @xmath46 . here ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfy @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the bilinear operators and @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , by choosing @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we can generate @xmath55 and @xmath40 for which the generic bright @xmath45-soliton solutions of eq .",
    "( [ dgp ] ) can be found from eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) .",
    "we will use this analytical result to construct the exact bright @xmath45-soliton solutions with many interesting nontrivial features .",
    "for the convenience of analyzing different dynamical regimes described by the given model , we specify the magnitude of main physical parameters , which are feasible in experiments .",
    "we consider a condensed sodium sample trapped in the state @xmath56 , which has the scattering length @xmath57 nm  @xcite .",
    "the other parameters can be taken as @xmath58 and @xmath59 hz , which leads to @xmath60 @xmath61 m and @xmath62 @xmath61m@xmath63 . to make sure",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath67 corresponds to the dissipative case when @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( we will focus on this condition next ) . in practical systems , the modulations of @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath42 depend on the use of the optical lattice and feshbach - resonance techniques , i.e. we can achieve @xmath7 and @xmath5 by exerting particular time - dependent optical field and magnetic field .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ condition ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) that @xmath36 is given by [ alpha ] _",
    "figure 1 shows the curves of @xmath36 , @xmath40 , and @xmath42 vs @xmath70 . for simplicity",
    ", we take @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 corresponding to the isotropic potential , and consider that the center of the potential locates at the origin ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we can also change @xmath74 to get an anisotropic potential and use nonzero @xmath75 to obtain moving bright solitons as those discussed in 1d case @xcite .",
    "based on the discussions in the previous section , we arrive at the fundamental 3d time - varying bright solitons [ one ]    ll _ 1(t,*r * ) = r_1(t ) seche^i ,    where @xmath76 with @xmath77 , and @xmath38 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ variable ] ) , ( [ phase ] ) and ( [ non ] ) .    figure 2 exhibits the dynamics of the time - varying bright soliton ( [ one ] ) .",
    "a breathing behavior is also evident , which can be managed by @xmath41 , @xmath81 , and @xmath38 . for the case @xmath82",
    ", we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 , in which the travelling - wave bright soliton is obtained . in experiments ,",
    "it can be simply realized for the zero linear potential .",
    "the bright soliton propagates in a zigzag trace for @xmath85 [ see fig.2(a ) ] .",
    "an important feature is that while @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) resulting in the larger period of @xmath41 given by eq.([gamma ] ) , the amplitude of the soliton close to the corners attenuates rapidly so that a soliton chain is generated [ see fig.2(b ) ] . in experiments",

    "[ see fig.3(a ) ] , two strong zigzag solitons with interaction [ see fig.3(b ) ] , and strong - weak zigzag solitons with interaction [ see fig.3(c ) ] .",
    "notice that similar with the bright solitons shown in fig.2(b ) , for the case @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , the amplitudes of the soliton - pairs close to the corners will almost decrease to zero so that panel ( a ) will degenerate to two parallel soliton chains while panels ( b ) and ( c ) will degenerate to the @xmath97-shaped soliton chains .",
    "the experimental realization of the dynamics regimes for the two - soliton solutions is similar with that for the bright one - soliton solutions .",
    "we stress that the important feature that distinguishes our solutions from the reported in the literature @xcite is the appearance of the time- and space - dependent functions in both the phase and the amplitude and which strongly affect the form and the behavior of bright solitons and their interactions .    in order to check the stability of the time - varying bright soliton ( [ one ] ) ,",
    "we make numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ dgp ] ) with the initial conditions given by eq .",

    "we find that the bright solitons are very stable for @xmath98 being small ( e.g. @xmath85 ) [ see fig.4(a ) ] . with the increase of @xmath98 ,",
    "the bright solitons become unstable [ see fig.4(b ) ] .",

    ", we have analytically constructed the novel 3d time - varying bright multi - soliton solutions for the ( 3 + 1)-d gp equation with time - space modulation .",
    "we focus on the bounded potential , nonlinearity , and gain / loss case to analyze the dynamics of the breathing and the zigzag propagation trace of the obtained solitons .",
