    "d - branes have been playing a central role in string theory for a number of years .",
    "they can be considered as soliton solutions of open string field theory .",
    "for example , in bosonic open string field theory , sen conjectured that d@xmath4-branes with @xmath5 are described as unstable lump solutions  @xcite and this was tested in many papers starting with @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "what we would like to study in this paper is how one can realize d - branes in closed string field theory .",
    "the closed string field theory that we consider here is the @xmath0 invariant string field theory  @xcite for bosonic strings .",
    "( see also  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . )",
    "the @xmath0 invariant string field theory is a covariantized version of the light - cone gauge string field theory  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is constructed so that the s - matrix elements of the light - cone theory are reproduced by using this formulation .",
    "however an extra time variable exists in the formulation , and the action of this theory looks different from that of the usual field theory . therefore , the @xmath0 invariant string field theory should be considered as something like stochastic or parisi - sourlas type formulation of field theory  @xcite@xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , treating the theory in such a manner , we constructed brst invariant observables in the @xmath0 invariant string field theory , from which one can calculate the s - matrix elements of string theory .    in @xcite , only on - shell asymptotic states are considered and the observables are brst invariant up to the nonlinear terms . in order to construct off - shell brst invariant states",
    ", we should take the nonlinear terms into account .",
    "what we would like to do in this paper is to construct such states using boundary states for d - branes .",
    "we consider states which act as source terms in the string field theory and have the effect of generating boundaries in the worldsheet .",
    "imposing the condition that the states are brst invariant in the leading order of regularization parameter @xmath1 , we can fix the form of the states .",
    "these states can be considered as states in which there exist solitons corresponding to d - branes and ghost d - branes  @xcite .",
    "we can construct states with an arbitrary number of such solitons .",
    "we calculate the disk amplitudes using these states and show that the disk amplitudes of bosonic string theory in the presence of d - branes and ghost d - branes are reproduced .    in @xcite , solitonic states corresponding to even number of d - branes or ghost d",
    "- branes were constructed by using the similarity between the string field theory for noncritical strings  @xcite and the @xmath0 invariant string field theory .",
    "although our construction in this paper is essentially the same as that in @xcite , we get different results because of several reasons .",
    "firstly , in @xcite , we considered the solitonic operators in analogy to noncritical string theory  @xcite@xcite and postulated the form of the vacuum amplitude using this analogy .",
    "we checked that the vacuum amplitude coincide with that for even number of d - branes in string theory .",
    "however , the vacuum amplitude is a constant which may be changed at will by changing the definition . in this paper",
    ", we rather calculate the disk amplitudes , which can be defined without such ambiguities .",
    "we show that the treatment of the solitonic states in @xcite corresponds to considering even number of solitons . secondly ,",
    "in @xcite , we defined the creation and the annihilation operators corresponding to normalized boundary states and performed calculations using these operators , which made the calculations rather indirect . in this paper , we do not introduce the artificial `` normalized boundary states '' , and calculate the brst transformation of the solitonic states directly .",
    "we find that a factor of @xmath6 was overlooked in the calculations of @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : soliton ]",
    ", we construct solitonic states in the @xmath0 invariant string field theory . imposing the condition that the states are brst invariant in the leading order of regularization parameter @xmath1",
    ", we can fix the form of the states . in section [ sec :",
    "disk ] , we calculate disk amplitudes using our solitonic states and show that disk amplitudes in the presence of d - branes and ghost d - branes are reproduced including the normalizations .",
    "thus we identify the solitons with d - branes and ghost d - branes .",

    "[ sec : conventions ] , we summarize the formulation of the @xmath0 invariant string field theory . in appendices [ sec : tree ] and [ sec :",
