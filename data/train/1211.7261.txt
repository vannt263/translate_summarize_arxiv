    "top physics is an important probe of theories of new physics at the tev scale , as many of these theories posit tev - scale partners to the top quark in order to resolve the higgs hierarchy problem .",
    "these theories in general have chiral structure , thus a measurement of the top polarization from the decays of top partners can establish useful constraints on them .    in the case of supersymmetry with @xmath9-parity ,",
    "the composition of the scalar top partner `` stop '' @xmath10 in terms of the weak eigenstates @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be constrained by observing the polarization of tops in the decay @xmath13 .",
    "the fermionic top partners in extra - dimensions theories with kk parity and little higgs theories with t - parity have the analogous decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as discrete parities are desirable because they limit dangerous contributions to electroweak precision variables  @xcite and admit wimp dark matter candidates ( such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , the @xmath19 collider signature provides a useful handle on a broad class of well - motivated tev - scale theories .",
    "there are also numerous theories with and without top partners containing extra massive gauge bosons @xmath20 with decays such as @xmath21 .",
    "top polarization measurements can constrain the chiral structure of their couplings to the top quark . in general , @xmath22 may be produced in new heavy resonances .    to date",
    "there have been a number of studies on measuring top polarization at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . ref .",
    "@xcite performed a signal - only monte carlo - level analysis in the context of gluino decay , and ref .",
    "@xcite performed a monte carlo - level analysis for kk gluons . for the @xmath19 class ,",
    "@xcite performed a signal - only parton - level formal calculation , followed by refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performing a monte carlo - level analysis with backgrounds , acceptance cuts and smearing effects . for heavy resonances , ref .",
    "@xcite considered the @xmath23jets background and smearing effects , later ref .",
    "@xcite performed a signal - only monte carlo - level analysis , and ref .",
    "@xcite studied various measurables in a fast detector simulation without backgrounds .",
    "@xcite elucidated the benefit of jet substructure for measuring the polarization of boosted hadronic tops for both classes of theories , although without backgrounds and at monte carlo - level .",
    "in this paper we study top polarization for the @xmath19 class of theories at _ detector level _ including all contamination sources ( e.g. , isr / fsr and mpi ) , relevant detector effects ( e.g. , magnetic field ) and backgrounds . to this end",
    "we focus on pair production of 600 gev and 800 gev @xmath24 at the 14  tev lhc under the simplified model in which they decay entirely to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27  gev .",
    "we choose to focus on supersymmetry also because it may be the most well - motivated of this class of theories , solving the hierarchy problem up to planck scale as well as enhancing gauge coupling unification at high scale .",
    "first we will briefly review the kinematics of top polarization and the phenomenology of @xmath12-@xmath11 mixing .",
    "then we will describe our simulation and analysis methodology , and present our results for the expected sensitivity to the stop mixing angle .",
    "finally , we will look ahead to possibilities for improving and ramifying our methodology .",
    "measurement of top polarization is possible because top quarks undergo weak decay prior to hadronization , so the top decay products carry information on the polarization of the parent quark undisturbed by the hadronization process",
    ". the kinematics of top polarization is presented in refs .",
    "the decay products of the top quark have the angular distributions @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angle between the daughter momentum and the top spin axis in the top rest frame ; we can take the latter as the direction of top momentum in the lab frame .",
    "@xmath30 is the polarization of the top quark , and @xmath31 is the `` spin analyzing power '' of the daughter flavor . for the @xmath32-quark , @xmath33",
    "whereas for the lepton daughter of a leptonic top decay one finds @xmath34 .",
    "consequently we can measure @xmath35 by observing the distribution of @xmath29 .",
    "for the case of hadronic tops , this can be done directly by reconstructing the top and resolving the @xmath32-quark daughter . however , for leptonic tops , one can not fully reconstruct the top momentum due to the neutrino from the @xmath36 decay .",
    "it has been proposed to define @xmath37 in an `` approximate rest frame '' in semileptonic events with reconstruction of the accompanying hadronic top  @xcite , or require the leptonic top in a semileptonic event to be highly boosted such that one can use alternative measurables which are insensitive to top momentum in the limit @xmath38  @xcite . yet another proposal is to use judicious cuts to preserve polarization information in the lab frame despite the boost of the leptonic top  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we measure the polarization of hadronic tops , which has not only the advantage of being more simple than leptonic methods , but also that of greater statistics , as 89% of top pairs have one hadronic top whereas only 44% of top pairs are semileptonic  @xcite .",
    "moreover , leptonic top analysis entails all the difficulties of identifying isolated leptons in a real hadron collider environment .",
    "standard cone - based lepton isolation lose efficiency with increasing boost , hampering polarization measurements for heavy parent states .",
    "however , this may be ameliorated by narrowing the isolation cone size as lepton @xmath39 increases  @xcite .",
    "as written in the review  @xcite , the stop mass matrix in the weak basis under the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 if @xmath43 and @xmath44 are real , the mixing can be represented by the rotation @xmath45 where @xmath46 and in which @xmath47 and @xmath48 have been substituted .",
    "let us consider the case that @xmath49 and @xmath44 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are of the same order at low scale ; we also assume @xmath52 at low scale due to renormalization . then if @xmath53 we see that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) ; conversely , if @xmath56 then @xmath24 will have a significant @xmath12 component ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "if indeed the mixing angle @xmath58 can be measured , then under these assumptions @xmath0 may be strongly constrained .",
    "these assumptions can be eased by incorporating other measurables .",
    "for example , knowledge of the @xmath24 mass ( e.g. , from production rates or kinematic constraints ) and the higgs mass , which takes large corrections at one - loop that depend on @xmath0 , @xmath44 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61  @xcite , would leave only the relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a model - dependent quantity .",
    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like boson  @xcite with a mass suggesting a large value of @xmath0 for tev - scale supersymmetric scalars  @xcite may already be hinting at such a correction . it has also been proposed to consider the ratios of the branching fractions of stops decaying to neutralinos and charginos in order to constrain stop mixing parameters .",
    "however , it may require input from both a hadron collider and a linear collider to have sufficient information  @xcite . in either case",
    ", this may be another set of observables which may be useful in tandem with direct polarization measurements .    to connect the stop mixing angle with top polarization",
    ", we consider the interaction term for the decay in our simplified model , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . ] in which @xmath62 , @xmath63\\\\ & = & g'{\\tilde t}_1^*{\\tilde\\chi}_1 ^ 0\\left[\\cos\\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right ) t_l + \\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)t_r\\right]\\\\\\notag &",

    "is @xmath65 thus for or simplified model the stop mixing angle is amplified in the top polarization mixing angle , increasing the sensitivity to @xmath11 and reducing the sensitivity to small @xmath12 admixtures . under the assumptions given before ,",
    "this therefore reduces the sensitivity to small values of @xmath0 .    putting together the higgs mass correction and top polarization arising from stop mixing",
    ", we can see the theoretical sensitivity of @xmath0 to the measured top polarization in figure  [ fig : susy ] . here",
    ", the top polarization is defined as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the coupling strengths @xmath69 and @xmath70 to the left - handed and right - handed tops , respectively .",
    "the higgs mass correction is computed using feynhiggs  @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass window is chosen to be the intersection of the @xmath71 atlas and cms regions , @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , sensitivity improves as the tops become more left - handed .",

    "blue region is for @xmath81 , and the red region for @xmath82 . ]",
    "the goal of our analysis is to show that top polarization information can be obtained by reconstructing boosted tops in a realistic hadron collider environment .",
    "first we describe the monte carlo generation of our data , then the detector simulation , and finally the reconstruction of top jets using the physics objects from the simulation .      using herwig++ 2.5.0  @xcite with all physics effects ( hadronization , isr / fsr , mpi ) included , we generated left ( @xmath83 ) , mixed ( @xmath84 ) and right ( @xmath85 ) @xmath86 samples with masses 600 gev and 800 gev for the 14  tev lhc under our simplified model .",
    "we calculated nlo production cross sections using prospino2.1  @xcite , shown in table  [ table : crosssections ] .",
    "we consider the backgrounds @xmath22+jets , @xmath87+jets , @xmath36+jets and @xmath88 , which we generated using madevent / madgraph 5.1.3  @xcite + pythia 6.4.25  @xcite ( also with all physics effects ) , taking their leading order cross sections which are also shown in table  [ table : crosssections ] .",
    "all extra jets are five - flavor ( @xmath89 + @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath32 ) .",
    ".signal and background cross - sections at 14  tev lhc . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in summary , after reviewing the motivation for top polarization measurement , the kinematics of top polarization , and the phenomenology of stop mixing , we described a simulation and analysis methodology for the @xmath19 collider signature that can distinguish stop mixing hypotheses at 14  tev lhc with @xmath94  fb@xmath2 of data .",
    "there are several possible improvements to the methodology .",
    "the first and foremost is to include polarization information from leptonic decays , perhaps using the techniques of  @xcite . also if , in consultation with experimenters , the trimming threshold of @xmath95  gev or the subjet cone size @xmath96 can be reduced , this would enhance the performance of the top reconstruction algorithm .",
    "finally , it may be useful to implement the top reconstruction technique of ref .",
    "@xcite to supplement @xmath32-tagging , especially at large boosts .",
    "other possible improvements are to :    * implement charm mistagging in the @xmath32-tagging algorithm , though this may be non - trivial as discussed in section  [ sec : btagging ] .",
    "* use spin - correlated backgrounds , e.g. from alpgen  @xcite .",
    "we did produce a small sample of @xmath97jets in alpgen but found no difference in the @xmath98 distribution from the madgraph / madevent+pythia events used in this analysis .",
    "* calculate backgrounds at nlo using , e.g. , mc@nlo  @xcite to increase accuracy .",
    "however , this is likely beyond our computational capabilities unless it is used only to normalize the leading - order backgrounds .",
    "we estimate that the @xmath99-factor for the @xmath22 background to be less than 1.2 given our cuts @xmath100 and @xmath101  gev  @xcite , though there is evidence that with an additional jet one may actually have @xmath102  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the lhc running at 14  tev may provide new discoveries in the top sector , in which case top polarization will be an important tool for constraining this new physics .",
    "the methodology in this paper may be useful for this purpose .",
