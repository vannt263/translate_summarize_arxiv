    "the drell - yan - west ( @xmath3 ) frame in the light - front quantization provided an effective formulation for the calculation of various form factors in the spacelike momentum transfer region @xmath4@xcite .",

    "however , not all is well . for the higher spin system composed of fermions",
    ", one needs in general to consider the nonvalence contribution ( e.g. fig .",
    "1(b ) ) to fulfill the covariance requirement even when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are used in the @xmath0 frame .",
    "the nonvalence contribution in the @xmath0 frame is called the  zero - mode \" .",
    "the details of zero - mode contributions for the spin - one system with the @xmath7 current coupled with longitudinal polarization vector as well as the semileptonic transition form factor of pseudoscalar meson with the @xmath8 current can be seen in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the timelike ( @xmath9 ) form factor analysis in the light - front quark model has been hindered by the fact that @xmath10 frame is defined only in the spacelike region ( @xmath11 ) . while the @xmath12 frame can be used in principle to compute the timelike form factors , it is inevitable ( if @xmath13 ) to encounter the nonvalence diagram arising from the quark - antiquark pair creation ( so called  z - graph \" ) as shown in fig .",
    "the main source of difficulty in calculating the nonvalence diagram ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) is the lack of information on the black blob which should contrast with the white blob representing the usual light - front valence wave function .",
    "in fact , it was reported@xcite that the omission of nonvalence contribution leads to a large deviation from the full results .",
    "the timelike form factors associated with the hadron pair productions in @xmath14 annihilations also involve the nonvalence contributions .",
    "therefore , it is not a simple task to explore the timelike region with the framework at hand and the investigation is still just at the beginning stage to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide at least a clear example of demonstration showing how one might take advantage of the existing formulation to get the new information ( i.e. nonvalence contribution or so called z - graph ) necessary in the timelike region of exclusive processes .",
    "this can be done by the analytic continuation from the spacelike form factor calculated in the drell - yan - west ( @xmath10 ) frame to the timelike region . in this paper , we focus on the case that does not require the zero - mode contributions even though one can in principle apply the same method presented in this work to the case of zero - mode contributions once they are identified .",
    "however , in the case of the zero - mode contributions , an additional step is necessary to identify them form factor for the exclusive semileptonic decays between two pseudoscalar mesons using the fermionic covariant model with the monopole smearing vertices  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we indeed verified the applicability of our method by checking if the identical results are obtained when different components of the current are used in different frames , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath0 frames .",
    "see also the discussion in section v. ] .",
    "for an explicit demonstration of our work , we use an exactly solvable model of ( @xmath16 ) dimensional scalar field theory interacting with gauge fields .",
    "the lagrangian of the system is given by  @xcite [ eq : lag ] l&= & ( _ _ a + ie_a a__a)^ ( ^_a + ie_a a^_a ) - m^2_a^_a_a + & & + ( _ _ b + ie_b a__b)^ ( ^_b + ie_b a^_b ) - m^2_b^_b_b + & & -(m^2 ^ 2 - _ ^ ) + g(^_a_b + ^_b_a ) , where @xmath17 corresponds to the bosonic quark field with the mass @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the bound state meson with the mass @xmath20 .",
    "our model is essentially the @xmath2 dimensional extension of mankiewicz and sawicki s @xmath21 dimensional quantum field theory model @xcite , which was later reinvestigated by several others @xcite .",
    "the starting model wave function is the of covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in the ladder approximation with a relativistic version of the contact interaction @xcite . here",
    ", we do not take the hamiltonian approach .",
    "the covariant model wave function is a product of two free single particle propagators , the overall momentum - conservation dirac delta , and a constant vertex function .",
    "consequently , all our form factor calculations are nothing but various ways of evaluating the feynman perturbation - theory triangle diagram in scalar field theory .",
    "even though the model may not be as realistic as one may want , it achieves the goal of being the first example up to our knowledge .",
    "we think that it provides at least some guidance how one can persue the same ( or similar ) idea in the more realistic ( perhaps more phenomenological in that respect ) models . in this model , we calculate : ( a ) the timelike process of @xmath22 transition in @xmath13 ( @xmath9 ) frame , ( b ) the spacelike process of @xmath23 in @xmath12 ( @xmath24 ) frame , and ( c ) the spacelike process of @xmath23 in @xmath10 frame . using the analytic continuation from @xmath24 to @xmath9",
    ", we show that the result in ( c ) , which is obtained without encountering the nonvalence contributions at all , exactly reproduces the result in ( a ) .",
    "in fact , all three results ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) coincide with each other in the entire @xmath25 range .",
    "we also confirm that our results are consistent with the dispersion relations@xcite .",

    "iii , the spacelike form factor of @xmath29 process is calculated both in the @xmath12 ( b ) and @xmath10 ( c ) frames .",

    "iv , for the numerical calculation of the em ( @xmath30 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ) meson form factors for three different cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , we use the constituent quark and antiquark masses ( @xmath31 gev , @xmath32 gev , and @xmath33 gev)@xcite and show that the form factors obtained from those three different cases are indeed equal to each other for the entire @xmath25 region .",

    "we investigated both spacelike and timelike regions of the meson em form factor using an exactly solvable model of @xmath2 dimensional scalar field theory interacting with gauge fields ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) ) .",
    "we calculated the form factor in spacelike region using the drell - yan - west ( @xmath0 ) frame and showed that its analytic continuation to the timelike region reproduces exactly the direct result of timelike form factor obtained in the longitudinal momentum ( @xmath13 and @xmath170 ) frame .",
    "the analytic continuation of the result in the @xmath0 frame to the timelike region automatically generates the effect of the nonvalence contributions to the timelike form factor .",
    "another interesting result in our model calculations is that the peaks analogous to the vmd were generated and the position of peaks were indeed quite consistent with the vmd .",
    "even though phenomenologically more elaborate analyses including the final state interaction may be necessary to reproduce the more realistic feature of vmd , our results seem pretty encouraging for further investigations . using the dispersion relations ,",
    "we have also confirmed that our numerical results of imaginary parts start at @xmath171 and the normal thresholds appear for @xmath30 and @xmath26 ( @xmath172 ) systems while the anomalous threshold exists for @xmath27 ( @xmath173 ) system .",
    "however , we note that our form factor calculations are effectively various ways of evaluating the feynman perturbation theory triangle diagrams and thus the analytic properties presented in sections ii , iii , and iv are restricted to one - loop diagrams .    even though the model ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) ) may not be as realistic as one may want , we think that it plays the role of some guidance for the more realistic phenomenological models . for an application of our analytic continuation method to the more realistic model ,",
    "we have considered an immediate extension of bosonic contact interaction to the fermionic covariant model with the monopole smearing vertices used by de melo et al .",
    "@xcite and investigated singular free processes in timelike region such as @xmath174 and @xmath175 semileptonic decays . in this application",
    ", we found that the covariant solution of the weak form factors @xmath176 for @xmath177 and @xmath178 and @xmath179 for @xmath180 processes are exactly equal to our analytic solutions obtained from the current @xmath7 in @xmath0 frame where only valence diagram is needed . on the other hand ,",
    "the form factors @xmath181 for @xmath177 and @xmath182 and @xmath183 for @xmath180 processes turn out to be affected by the zero - mode contributions and one has to include the zero - mode effects to make our analytic solutions from @xmath0 frame equal to the covariant solutions ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this covariant model calculation further verifies the validity of our analytic continuation method .",
    "we also applied our analytic continuation method to the same semileptonic decay processes of various pseudoscalar and vector mesons using our lfqm  @xcite and found a good agreement with the available experimental data as well as the lattice calculations .",
    "however , an additional step of identifying the zero - mode contributions is necessary in handling the zero - mode issue associated with the currents @xmath8 for @xmath177 and @xmath7 coupled with longitudinal decay modes for @xmath180 exclusive semileptonic decay processes .",
    "also , the singular structures around the pole - regions in the timelike elastic form factors needs to be further investigated in the more phenomenological model .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging that in this first attempt of calculating the timelike elastic meson form factor , the analytic continuation method seems to work as nicely as one may have anticipated .",
    "we would like to thank g .- h.kim for assisting the numerical analysis of dispersion relations .",
