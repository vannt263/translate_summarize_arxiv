    "<S> we find a consistency between two different approaches of hard diffraction , namely the qcd dipole model and the soft colour interaction approach . a theoretical interpretation in terms of s - matrix and perturbative qcd properties in the small @xmath0 regime is proposed .    </S>",
    "<S>     * 1 . * in the present paper , we focus on two different theoretical approaches to hard diffraction , which are shown to be compatible and complementary . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is based on an extension @xcite to hard diffractive processes of the `` qcd dipole '' approach in the small @xmath0 regime of perturbative qcd . in this picture , the hard photon is supposed to probe the parton structure of the pomeron considered as an hadronic particle . in the original ingelman - schlein formulation , </S>",
    "<S> this hard probe was formulated in the parton model , later complemented by qcd evolution equations @xcite . in the dipole model , this hard interaction is described via the balitsky fadin kuraev lipatov ( bfkl ) resummation @xcite . a major uncertainty for this model is the relative normalization of diffractive over non - diffractive cross - sections which stays beyond the perturbative framework .    a second approach @xcite is the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model , where hard diffraction is described as the superposition of two processes . </S>",
    "<S> at short time , the hard probe initiates a typical deep - inelastic interaction with colour quantum numbers exchange . </S>",
    "<S> then , at large times / distances , a `` soft '' colour interaction is assumed to rearrange the colour quantum numbers and gives rise to singlet exhanges -and thus diffraction- with a probability of order @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of colours . while in this approach , the relative normalization is fixed , the exact nature of the interplay between soft and hard components is not known .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a way to relate these two approaches which allows one to consider them as compatible and complementary . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a definite prediction for both the normalization and the analytic form of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are the following :    * i ) * the interplay between hard and soft components of hard diffraction is expressed via `` effective '' parameters of a pomeron interaction determined from leading log perturbative qcd resummation . </S>",
    "<S> it is found to depend not only on @xmath3 but also on the ratio @xmath4 where y ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> y ) are the total ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> gap ) rapidity interval .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath5 with @xmath6 is the bfkl evolution kernel @xcite ( together with its gaussian approximation near the minimum at @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 a non - perturbative scale associated with the proton . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath9    note that one may write @xmath10 which is the known `` triple pomeron '' formula @xcite where @xmath11 defines the effective interaction cross - section of a virtual photon with a bfkl pomeron @xmath12 derived from the qcd dipole formalism . by analogy with bfkl @xcite , @xmath13 and @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> can be defined , respectively , as the anomalous dimension , intercept and diffusion parameter of an `` effective '' bfkl @xmath15 cross - section .    </S>",
    "<S> the normalization , which remains unknown in the qcd dipole model description , is determined as the product of the factor @xmath16 and the normalization factor @xmath17 of the non - diffractive structure function , according to the sci prescription , see below .    </S>",
    "<S> * ii ) * in sci models , the following relation between the total structure function and the overall contribution of hard diffraction at fixed value reads of @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the minimal rapidity gap . </S>",
    "<S> if we insert the qcd dipole prediction for @xmath21 in formula ( [ biczy4 ] ) , we find @xmath22 which is equivalent to a canonical bfkl expression for non - diffractive structure functions , apart the substitution of the bfkl effective anomalous dimension @xmath23 by @xmath24 namely @xmath25 where the `` universal '' value @xmath26 is solution ( for @xmath27 ) of the implicit equation @xmath28 . here , it is interesting to note that the shift ( [ value ] ) may be useful to avoid the objection to sci models @xcite based on `` low s theorem '' following which soft colour radiation can not be emmitted from inside a partonic process . </S>",
    "<S> the differences we find with the original model means that , in our dipole formulation , the soft colour interaction indeed seems to modify the initial parton kinematics .    </S>",
    "<S> * iii ) * using s - matrix properties of triple - regge contributions , a relation is found between discontinuities of a @xmath29 amplitude and the two approaches to hard diffraction we consider . following old results of s - matrix theory in the regge domain @xcite , and as sketched in fig.1 , one may consider three types of discontinuities of a @xmath29 amplitude representing hard diffraction . a single discontinuity over the diffractive @xmath30 describing the hard pomeron interaction , a double discontinuity taking into account the analytic discontinuity in the subenergy variable of one of the incident pomeron exchanges ( and its complex conjugate ) for the sci model and the full triple discontinuity including those of the two pomeron exchanges , which is characteristic of the qcd dipole model description @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting new feature is thus the s - matrix interpretation of the sci approach as a specific double discontinuity of the @xmath29 forward amplitude , which formulates the model in terms of simultaneous exchanges of a soft and a hard pomeron .    </S>",
    "<S> * 2 . * </S>",
    "<S> let us sketch the derivation of our results .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is a triple - regge formula for the diffractive structure function for longitudinal and transverse photon in the qcd dipole formalism : f_t , l^diff(q^2,y , y)~ _ c - i^c+i   ( 1-_1-_2- )   ( qq_0)^2  \\{y ( ( _ 1)+(_2 ) ) + ( y - y )   ( ) }  , biczy where @xmath31 is the bfkl evolution kernel ( [ chi ] ) and @xmath32 is a normalization containing both qcd perturbative and non - perturbative factors @xcite . strictly speaking @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33-function is the unique contribution in the differential diffractive structure function at momentum transfer @xmath34 however , it can be shown that this is the dominant perturbative contribution even at non zero transfer due to specific properties @xcite of the analytic qcd triple - pomeron couplings @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the first step of the computation of formula ( [ biczy ] ) is to use the saddle - point approximation @xcite at large @xmath35 to integrate over the difference @xmath36 one easily gets f_t , l^diff= n^diff1x_p  _ c - i^c+i \\{2y  ( 2 ) + ( y - y )  ( ) + 2 qq_0 }  . </S>",
    "<S> biczy1    using the gaussian approximation ( [ chi ] ) for the bfkl kernels @xmath31 and @xmath37 in the relevant interval @xmath38 and again a saddle - point approximation at large rapidity gap @xmath35 , one obtains , up to a normalization factor , formula ( [ biczy10 ] ) , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 defined as in ( [ epsilon ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization @xmath32 is not yet specified at this stage .    </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the normalization is coming from the comparison with the sci approach . inserting ( [ biczy ] ) in the integral ( [ biczy4 ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> one is led to perform a two - dimensional saddle - point approximation in the @xmath39 complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> the saddle - point equations read : -y  ^ ( 2 ) + ( y - y )  ^ ( ) + 2 qq_0=0 2()-()=0  , cols whose solution @xmath40 is y^ * & = & ( y+ )  ( 1+)^-1 ( ^*)&=&2 ( )   solution resulting in a value of @xmath41 which is `` universal '' , i.e. independent of the kinematics of the reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> after computation of the prefactors to the saddle - point approximation , one finds : f_t , l^diff / tot = ^diff 1 ^(2)+^(^ * ) ( qq_0)^2^ *  . biczy7 note that it is the linearity in @xmath35 of the saddle - point equation ( [ cols ] ) which allows one to get such an elegant form for the integrals </S>",
    "<S> using ( [ biczy7 ] ) and by comparison with the canonical bfkl formula we identify the `` hard '' component of the sci model by the substitution @xmath42 see ( [ value ] ) . then using the sci ansatz ( [ biczy4 ] ) , we obtain the relation ^diff  ^(2)+^(^ * ) norma which fixes the relative normalization of the diffractive vs. non diffractive structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> this ends the derivation of formulae ( [ biczy10]-[value ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * 3 . * </S>",
    "<S> let us finally come to the s - matrix interpretation of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> for every fixed but arbitrary value of the parameters @xmath43 the triple - regge formula ( [ biczy ] ) can be obtained from the canonical formulalism _ </S>",
    "<S> elastic _ amplitudes in both the s - matrix framework @xcite and perturbative qcd at leading log level @xcite . ] corresponding to the vertex of three regge pole singularities in the complex plane of angular momentum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as such , one can make use of the important s - matrix mueller - regge relation @xcite , valid in kinematical regions including the triple - regge limit , between semi - inclusive amplitudes and specific discontinuity contributions of forward elastic @xmath29 amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> it naturally applies to hard diffraction initiated by a virtual photon , as sketched in fig.1 , namely ^ * + pp + x  disc_1\\{^ * |p  p   ^ * |p  p }   . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3to3 ] quite interestingly , the existence of regge phase factors allows one to relate other discontinuities of @xmath44 to @xmath45 as sketched in fig.1 , one may also consider a double discontinuity @xmath46 taking into account also the analytic discontinuity in the subenergy of one of the incident pomeron exchanges and a triple discontinuity @xmath47 including the discontinuity over the two pomeron exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> the expression of the discontinuities , through generalized unitarity relations , is obtained through the imaginary part of the relevant regge phase factors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one finds an equality relation @xmath48 which is due to the fact that the discontinuity taken over the mass variable ( corresponding to diffractively produced states ) is common to all three cases in fig.1 and factorizes the same @xmath49 vertex in @xmath50 ( cf . the classical derivation in the last paper of ref.@xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now take advantage of the hard probe in the process , allowing one to introduce in the game the ( resummed ) perturbative qcd expansion at high energy ( small @xmath0 ) . in a generic s - matrix approach , the analytic discontinuities of scattering amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> are related to a summation over a complete set of asymptotic _ hadronic _ final states . if however , the underlying microscopic field theory is at work with small renormalized coupling constant due to the hard probe , it is possible in some cases to approximate the same discontinuity using a complete set of _ partonic _ states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , at high energy and within the approximation of leading logs ( and also large @xmath2 ) , qcd dipoles can be identified as providing such a basis .    </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity @xmath51 appears naturally in the dipole formulation of hard diffraction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , hard diffraction calculations make use of the probability distribution for finding two dipoles in the wave - function of one initial dipole in the virtual photon through the exchange over a bfkl pomeron exchange described by its discontinuity in the @xmath52 rapidity range </S>",
    "<S> . then , each of these dipoles interact with the target through two perturbative ( bfkl ) pomeron exchanges described by their own discontinuities over the @xmath35 range . </S>",
    "<S> thus the calculation of scattering amplitudes implies the full discontinuity over three pomerons described by intermediate dipole interactions , which is nothing but @xmath53    the appearance of @xmath54 is natural in the regge formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however a physical interpretation involving perturbative qcd contributions has not been previously noticed . in the framework of our study </S>",
    "<S> , it corresponds to the superposition of a hard perturbative cut pomeron interaction with a soft one described by a non - cut pomeron ( with complex conjugate contribution , see fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the superposition of hard and soft interactions which characterizes the sci approach . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus led to propose @xmath54 as a way to get quantitative predictions , in particular the relative normalization of diffractive over non diffractive cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it appears as a `` hard '' partonic interaction very similar to the one describing ordinary deep - inelastic processes , in parallel with a `` soft '' correction evolving during a long time , corresponding to the uncut pomeron singularity in the middle graphs ( including complex conjugate ) of fig.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the equality between the different discontinuities allows the connection between the different models , leading to the results given in section * 1*.    * figure *    epsf = 8.truecm = 8.cm    * figure 1 *    _ s - matrix interpretation of the three approaches to hard diffraction . _ </S>",
