    "in four years of operation , the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope has opened a new window to the world of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) spectroscopy .",
    "observations by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm , @xcite ) between 8 kev and 40 mev and the large area telescope ( lat , @xcite ) from 20 mev to hundreds of gev have provided a high - energy view over an unprecedentedly broad energy baseline .",
    "follow - up observations of lat - detected grbs have revealed the redshift of about a dozen grbs detected above 100 mev ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "determining the redshift of grbs enables the study of the energetics and rest - frame properties of these events . owing to the localization limitations of the gbm experiment , follow - up observations of grbs localized at trigger time only by gbm were rare until we disseminated the results of the work presented here , in which uncertainties in grb localizations are characterized .",
    "grb  090902b @xcite was observed by rotse @xcite an hour after the trigger , with rotse tiling the gbm error circle hours before the burst was better localized using lat and _ swift _ data .",
    "a source was subsequently found in the rotse data at the position of the burst , providing the earliest measurements of the grb afterglow .",
    "grb  130702a was observed by the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ) , with the telescope tiling 72 square degrees in 10 separate pointings , and uncovering the afterglow of the grb 4.2 hours after the gbm trigger @xcite .",
    "this was the first discovery of afterglow emission from observations that used only the gbm localization and did not require additional , more accurate , positions from the lat or from _ swift _ to find the source in the large observed sky region .",
    "since then , regular observations by iptf of grbs localized by gbm revealed the afterglows for eight more grbs in 35 attempts ( l. singer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in general , however , the small fields - of - view of the most sensitive follow - up telescopes have deterred regular observations of the degrees - scale uncertainty regions resulting from gbm localizations .",
    "a further discouraging aspect of gbm localizations is that the total error is often larger than the reported statistical uncertainty . using a bayesian method similar to that reported here",
    ", @xcite analyzed 36 gbm grb localizations and found the 68% confidence level systematic uncertainty to be @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite use a sample of 149 grbs detected by gbm and by other instruments in the interplanetary network ( ipn ) to infer a 90% confidence level systematic uncertainty of @xmath4 .",
    "we report here a study of systematic uncertainties using over 300 reference locations provided by other instruments and by the ipn .",
    "the technique we use is based on the work of @xcite and @xcite , who developed a bayesian approach to characterize systematic uncertainties for the grbs detected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory .",
    "gbm detects about 240 grbs per year @xcite , providing real - time locations for the follow - up community .",
    "approximately 17% of _ fermi _ gbm - detected grbs are short in duration @xcite . unlike the short grb population detected by _ swift _",
    ", which may contain weak collapsar events @xcite , it is likely that most gbm - detected short grbs ( sgrbs ) are associated with the merger of compact binary systems .",
    "there are therefore 40 or so merger grbs per year detected by gbm that could potentially be observed at other wavelengths .",
    "mergers of compact binary systems are likely sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "no associations were found between 154 grbs detected in 2009 - 2010 by various spacecraft , including gbm , and potential signals in the ligo and virgo gw experiments @xcite .",
    "this was not unexpected given the detection horizon of about 20 mpc for these experiments .",
    "advanced configurations of both experiments will be deployed over the next few years , with horizons of 400 [ 1000 ] mpc for ns - ns [ ns - bh ] mergers @xcite .",
    "it is realistic to expect several joint detections of sgrbs by gbm and gw candidates by a - ligo / virgo per year @xcite .",
    "for the first years of a - ligo / virgo operation , localization uncertainties for gw candidates are estimated to be 1000 square degrees or more @xcite , larger than the gbm uncertainty regions , consisting of annuli segments that may encompass non - contiguous sky regions .",
    "it is especially important to enable the optical community to observe sgrbs while the afterglow is still bright enough to be detected above the background in a large error box .",
    "for gbm - detected sgrbs , this may imply covering only a small part of the error box .    in section 2",
    "we describe the detection and localization of grbs by gbm and in section 3 their dissemination to the public over the grb coordinates network .",
    "the sample of reference locations from detections by other instruments or by the interplanetary network is introduced in section 4 , where reference point locations are compared to the gbm localizations and their reported statistical uncertainties . in section 5 , we describe our method to assess the effect of systematic uncertainties on grb localization .",
    "we report results for the models we tested . in section 6",
    "we summarize our results and describe new data products that use these results to facilitate follow - up observations of grbs localized by gbm .",
    "the gbm views the entire unocculted sky , over 7 steradians , using 12 sodium iodide ( nai ) detectors , 1.27  cm thick and 12.7  cm in diameter , covering an energy range from 8 kev to 1 mev , and two bismuth germanate ( bgo ) scintillators , 12.7  cm in diameter and thickness , placed on opposite sides of the spacecraft , with energy coverage from 200 kev to 40 mev @xcite . in a coordinate system centered on the spacecraft , the z - axis is oriented along the boresight of the lat , the x - axis joins the two bgo detectors , and the y - axis joins the lat radiators , as shown in figure  [ fig : det_place ] .",
    "the placement of the nai detectors , which all have different orientations , in four clusters of three detectors gives maximum coverage along the positive z - axis .",
    "this means grbs in the lat field - of - view are seen by more gbm detectors than those outside . if _",
    "fermi _ were pointed at the local zenith , the earth would occupy the region in spacecraft coordinates viewed by the fewest detectors , along the negative z - axis . in nominal sky - survey mode , _ fermi _ views the whole sky every 3 hours ( 2 spacecraft orbits ) by tilting alternately north and south of the zenith each orbit to obtain uniform sky survey coverage when the exposure is averaged over just a few orbits .",
    "the angle of the tilt , called the rocking angle , has changed from @xmath5 at the start of the _ fermi _ mission to @xmath6 in october 2009 , the change being necessary to place _ fermi _ in a rocking profile that keeps the spacecraft battery cool .",
    "the energy information from the gbm detectors is binned in 128 channels constructed using the 4096 channels in the data processing unit that result from the digitzation of the analog output from the detector front - end electronics .",
    "channel - to - energy conversion uses pre - launch exposures to radioactive sources between 14 kev and 4.4 mev and a spline fit between and beyond the energies of the known sources covers the whole energy range .",
    "details of the energy calibration are given in @xcite .",
    "the localization of sources is done with an 8-channel rebinning of the full - resolution 128-channel data into a quicklook data type that is downloaded in real - time when a trigger occurs .",
    "source localization uses the relative rates recorded in the 12 nai detectors to estimate the most likely arrival direction given the angular and spectral response of the detectors .",
    "the detector response model was constructed from simulations incorporating the _ fermi _ spacecraft mass model into geant4 @xcite .",
    "incident photons with energies between 5  kev and @xmath7  50  mev were injected from 272 directions in the spacecraft coordinate system to evaluate the geometry - dependent detector response .",
    "a @xmath8 minimization process finds the direction on the sky from which the expected count rates from our detector response model most closely match the observed detector count rates in all 12 nai detectors .",
    "the observed counts include a background component that is subtracted before modeling the source .",
    "the observed source counts are compared to expectation from evenly distributed points on a 1@xmath9 resolution grid in spacecraft coordinates that linearly interpolates among the three closest of the native 272 sky directions giving 41168 grid points .",
    "the source rates contain three elements : direct flux from the source , flux scattered in the spacecraft , and flux scattered from the atmosphere .",
    "contributions from each of these components depend on the observing geometry and on the spectrum of gamma rays from the source .",
    "we construct our instrument response matrices for a particular grb by adding two model terms , the direct response , which depends only on the source - spacecraft geometry , and the atmospheric response , which depends on the source - spacecraft - earth geometry .",
    "the direct response is calculated by interpolating among the three closest of 272 sky points in the native database compiled from the geant simulations .",
    "our atmospheric response calculation is a simplification of the true geometry in which the earth - spacecraft geometry has many solutions .",
    "we use the atmospheric response database established for batse @xcite . for each of the 41168 grid points we calculate the rates normal to each detector for the earth - spacecraft geometry at the time of a trigger .",
    "we construct three tables with the model count rates between 50 and 300 kev for each detector at each point on this grid , using three source spectra representing spectrally soft , medium , and hard grbs .",
    "the source spectra are modeled using the band function parametrization @xcite , two power - law components , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , that are smoothly joined , and a peak in the power per decade of energy , @xmath12 :    @xmath13 \\qquad   & e < [ ( \\alpha - \\beta ) e_{peak}]/(\\alpha + 2 ) \\\\       = \\left(\\frac{e}{100}\\right)^\\beta \\exp(\\beta - \\alpha)\\left[\\frac{(\\alpha - \\beta ) e_{peak}}{100 ( \\alpha + 2)}\\right]^{\\alpha - \\beta } \\qquad &    e \\geq [ ( \\alpha - \\beta ) e_{peak}]/(\\alpha + 2 ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    the band function parameters for these three spectra are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 = ( -1.9 , -3.7 , 70 kev ) , ( -1 , -2.3 , 230 kev ) , and ( 0 , -1.5 , 1 mev ) . thus , the direct response is fixed and depends only on the source position in spacecraft coordinates . to this",
    "we add an atmospheric component that is calculated during the execution of the localization code and that depends on the position of the earth in spacecraft coordinates .",
    "a @xmath14 minimization of each of the three tables ( soft , medium , hard ) relative to the observed rates produces the most likely arrival direction in spacecraft coordinates for each of the three model spectra , and the lowest @xmath8 among the three minima is assumed to be from the spectrum that most closely resembles the burst . the position from the selected table",
    "is translated to equatorial coordinates using the spacecraft attitude at trigger time .",
    "the reported 68% statistical uncertainty is the average distance to the grid points that lie at @xmath15 = 2.3 , assuming a circular uncertainty region .",
    "a lower limit to the reported statistical uncertainty of @xmath0 is imposed to match the grid resolution , though in practice the @xmath8 contours can be very steep within the grid points .",
    "a discussion of the @xmath8 distributions and the selection of the best model based on @xmath8 is given in appendix a.",
    "it is desirable to generate grb localizations as soon as possible after the trigger .",
    "an automated process requiring no human intervention produces initial localizations from the on - board flight software algorithms ( fsw locations ) and on the ground ( ground - auto locations ) , both within 10 - 30  s of the grb trigger .",
    "refined ground locations use more data and human judgment ( human in the loop , or hitl locations ) and are distributed on the order of an hour later .",
    "when a gbm trigger occurs on - board _ fermi _ , the gbm flight software ( fsw ) produces trigger data types that are downlinked to the ground upon summoning the tracking and data relay satellite system ( tdrss ) link , a 5 second process .",
    "in addition to activating a tdrss link , the gbm fsw communicates with the lat via the spacecraft bus , informing the lat fsw that a trigger has occurred , its nature ( grb , solar flare etc . ) , and sends a localization produced by the fsw .",
    "because of memory limitations on - board , the fsw localization uses a coarser sky grid than previously described ( 5@xmath9 ) and only one spectral model table , the band function medium spectrum defined above , to which is added a pre - computed atmospheric scattering component that assumes the earth is at the spacecraft nadir rather than calculating the atmospheric scattering component at trigger time .",
    "the first localization is produced by the fsw using the counts recorded in the most significant data accumulation on 17 time - scales ranging from 16 ms to 4.096 s , using data in the time interval leading to the trigger and an additional 1.5  s of data accumulated following the trigger time , to find a @xmath8 minimum in the on - board model rates table .",
    "the lat uses this location as a seed to allow a less stringent on - board trigger level than its usual all - sky on - board science algorithm .",
    "the fsw produces further localizations if later data accumulations on time - scales from 16 ms to 4.096 s are more significant relative to the background level than the initial accumulation at 1.5  s post - trigger , with these later localizations communicated both to the lat and to the ground .",
    "in addition to the localizations produced by the fsw , tdrss is also used to transmit the most significant count rates above background on the 16  ms to 4.096 s accumulation intervals , called maxrates , with maxrates transmission occurring only if the rates are more significant relative to the background level than previous maxrates calculations on any time - scale .",
    "finally , a background count - rate record is transmitted that contains the average count rates in each detector over a 16  s period prior to the trigger time and separated from the trigger window by 3  s. after reception on the ground , maxrates and background packets , which also contain spacecraft position and attitude information , are ingested into the burst alert processor ( bap ) at nasa gsfc ( or its backup at the gbm instrument operations center in hunstville ) .",
    "the fsw - determined background rates are subtracted from the maxrates to give source rates that are compared to the models .",
    "a ground - auto localization is generated using the full - resolution model rates tables including an atmospheric response component that uses the true earth position rather than assuming a zenith - pointed _ fermi _ spacecraft .",
    "both fsw and ground - auto localizations are communicated as notices to the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) if the statistical uncertainty is lower than previous fsw or ground - auto notices .    over the next ten minutes",
    ", the fsw transmits via tdrss a count rate time history covering from 200  s prior to 450  s following the trigger time , and the bap alerts the gbm burst advocate ( ba ) to the presence of a trigger so that a hitl location can be generated when the real - time data set is complete .",
    "both the fsw and the ground - auto locations use single accumulations in intervals from 16 ms to 4.096 s and can thus be considered peak - flux localizations . for the hitl localizations ,",
    "the ba can select a source interval to produce a fluence localization that should in many cases yield a localization with a smaller statistical uncertainty .",
    "the ba selects time intervals before and after the burst emission to fit with a polynomial of order up to 4 as a background model that is subtracted from the observed counts in the source interval prior to the @xmath14 minimization .",
    "the three types of localizations are distributed without delay via gcn notices using email and socket connections .",
    "fsw notices are sent out for all triggers and include a trigger classification ( see @xcite for a discussion of the fsw trigger classification procedure ) .",
    "ground - auto notices are distributed only if the fsw classified the trigger as a grb at the time the maxrates packet was produced and the ground - auto localization passed an automated @xmath14 quality test ( i.e. , the localization appears consistent with a distant point source based on the relative rates in the detectors ) .",
    "hitl positions are sent as final position notices only if the ba classifies the event as a grb and the grb has not been localized more precisely by another instrument at the time of the hitl processing .",
    "table  [ tab : types ] summarizes the types of locations , their reported statistical uncertainties , the typical latencies until the first gcn notice is issued , and the number of notices of each type issued for a trigger classified by the fsw as a grb .",
    ".types of localization produced by gbm for grb triggers .",
    "localization uncertainties are 68% cl statistical uncertainties .",
    "the ground - automated notice latency has varied throughout the mission as described in the text , and each configuration is listed separately .",
    "the human - processed ( hitl ) notices are a new feature implemented in late 2011 .",
