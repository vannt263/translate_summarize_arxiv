    "the function @xmath9 has a maximum @xmath10 at @xmath11 , is zero for @xmath12 , and has the limit @xmath13 for @xmath14",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : vfitchett ] ) tells us that in the coalescence of binary black holes ( bhs)where @xmath6 can approach @xmath15the kick might reach thousands of km / s .",
    "this is far greater than the escape velocity of many globular clusters ( typically @xmath16 km / s ) , and may even exceed galactic escape velocities ( @xmath17 km / s ) .",
    "recoil could thus have important astrophysical implications @xcite [ some of which are explored in a companion paper ( @xcite ; paper ii ) ] .",
    "this has motivated us to revisit this problem .",
    "equation ( [ eq : vfitchett ] ) indicates that the recoil is strongest at small separations , when the relativistic effects neglected by fitchett are most important .",
    "this issue has been addressed in restricted circumstances using perturbation theory @xcite , post - newtonian expansions @xcite , and numerical relativity @xcite . unlike previous analyses",
    ", our treatment applies to the strong - gravity , fast - motion regime around spinning holes undergoing binary coalescence .",
    "using bh perturbation theory we model the dynamics of the binary , the generation of gws , and the backreaction of those waves on the system up to the inner - most stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "our results are accurate only for extreme mass ratio inspirals ( @xmath18 ) , but we can extrapolate to @xmath1 with modest error .",
    "we model the gw emission from the final plunge more crudely .",
    "the rate at which momentum is radiated is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the `` plus '' and `` cross '' gw polarizations , @xmath21 is a unit radial vector from the source , and @xmath22 is the distance to the observer @xcite .",

    "@xcite provides an intuitive description of the recoil : when two non - spinning bodies are in circular orbit , the lighter mass moves faster and is more effective at `` forward beaming '' its radiation .",
    "net momentum is ejected in the direction of the lighter mass s velocity , with opposing com recoil . when @xmath30 , the beaming is symmetric and the recoil vanishes .",
    "the instantaneous recoil continually changes direction over a circular orbit , so the com traces a circle . neglecting radiation reaction , this circle closes , and the recoil averages to zero over each orbit . with radiative losses , the orbit does not close , and the recoil accumulates .",
    "this accumulation proceeds until the holes plunge and merge , shutting off the radiated momentum flux and yielding a net , non - zero kick velocity ( cf .",

    "spin complicates this picture by breaking the binary s symmetry .",
    "consider an equal - mass binary , with one member spinning parallel to the orbital angular momentum .",

    "@xcite provides a relation between these parameters , valid in the post - newtonian limit for @xmath45 : @xmath46 . because of this ambiguity , we present our results in terms of the effective - spin - parameter @xmath44 .",
    "even if the larger hole s spin is nearly maximal ( @xmath47 ) , finite mass ratios @xmath48 restrict our results to spins with @xmath49 .    when applied to a perturbation calculation of the head - on collision of two bhs , an effective - one - body scaling of the gw energy flux ( @xmath50 ) in which @xmath51 has been shown to agree with results from full numerical relativity @xcite .",

    "the isco is at large radius ( @xmath94 for @xmath95 ) and fitchett s newtonian formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : vfitchett ] ) ] agrees well with our result . for prograde inspiral into rapidly spinning holes ,",
    "the isco is deep in the strong field , where relativistic effects become important and suppress the recoil relative to fitchett s result .",
    "during the plunge , the small body s motion is dominated by the kerr effective potential rather than radiation - reaction forces @xcite .",
    "it is easy to match a plunging geodesic with constant @xmath79 and @xmath80 onto an inspiral trajectory near the isco . with a code that does not fourier",
    "expand @xmath65 @xcite , one could properly compute the gw emission and associated recoil along such a plunging trajectory ( when @xmath14 ) .    since we do not have such a code at hand",
    ", we must estimate the wave emission more crudely .",
    "our results from the inspiral show that , for a given spin , @xmath96 is well described by a power law in radius , @xmath97 , from large @xmath22 up to the isco . as an approximate `` upper limit '' of the recoil , we make the ansatz that this power law can be continued past the isco .",
    "this must break down at some point : the power - law reflects the circularity of the inspiral orbit and should be suppressed by the increasingly radial motion during the plunge . to prevent the momentum flux from diverging ,",
    "we truncate the power law at @xmath98 , replacing it with the condition that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is proper time along the plunge geodesic .",

    "the upper - curve of figure [ fig : vrecoil]b shows the result of this calculation ( for @xmath86 ) .",
    "we also perform a separate `` lower - limit '' calculation .",
    "a plunge trajectory is computed as before , but in place of the power - law ansatz for @xmath96 , we integrate the truncated , multipole expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : recoil_leading ] ) instead . in this calculation",
    "the momentum flux initially grows like a power law , but then decreases as the plunging trajectory nears the event horizon . because we neglect higher multipoles ( which are extremely important in the fast - motion , strong - gravity region )",
    ", this method likely underestimates the recoil .",
    "the total accumulated recoil at the cutoff time @xmath77 using this method is shown in the lower curve of figure [ fig : vrecoil]b ( also for @xmath86 ) .",
    "the shaded region between the two curves in figure [ fig : vrecoil]b represents our uncertainty in the total recoil at the end of the plunge .",
    "this uncertainty is largest for retrograde orbits around rapidly spinning holes , in which the distance the particle must `` plunge '' is greatest . for prograde inspiral into rapidly spinning holes ,",
    "much of the recoil is due to emission during the slow inspiral phase , for which our bh perturbation techniques are well - suited .",
    "figure [ fig : a0.8pro ] shows the relative contributions from the inspiral and plunge for such a scenario .",
    "although the two calculations for the plunge recoil give rather different results , useful astrophysical information is contained in the approximate upper and lower bounds that they represent . the estimate @xmath102 bisects the shaded region of figure [ fig : vrecoil]b and represents a typical recoil velocity for this mass ratio .",
    "note also that the numbers in figure [ fig : vrecoil ] can be scaled to higher mass ratios by multiplying by @xmath103 . for @xmath104",
    "this implies that our results can be augmented by a factor @xmath105 .",
    "the punchline of this analysis is simple : quasi - newtonian estimates have significantly overestimated the kick velocity from anisotropic gw emission during binary coalescence .",
    "the recoil is strongest when the smaller member is deep in the strong - field of the large black hole .",
    "general relativistic effects , such as the gravitational redshift and spacetime curvature - scattering , act on the emitted gws and reduce the recoil .    though reduced",
    ", the recoil remains large enough to have important astrophysical consequences . recoils with @xmath106@xmath107",
    "are likely ; kicks of a few hundred km / s are not unexpected ; and the largest possible recoils are probably @xmath108 .",
    "these speeds are smaller than most galactic escape velocities , suggesting that bh mergers that follow galaxy mergers will remain within their host structures . however , these recoils are similar to the escape speeds of dwarf galaxies ; and they may be sufficient to escape from mergers in high redshift structures [ @xmath109 ; cf . , fig .",
    "binary bh ejection from globular clusters is quite likely , with significant implications for the formation of intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) via hierarchical mergers @xcite .",
    "our recoil estimates will also be useful in simulations of supermassive and imbh evolution in dark halos @xcite .",
    "future papers will present the formalism used for this analysis , and will investigate the influence of orbital inclination on the recoil .",
    "more work in perturbation theory also remains in addressing the recoil from the plunge and final ringdown of the merging black holes .",
    "finally , @xcite have speculated that spin - orbit misalignment could lead to recoil directed out of the orbital plane .",
    "this recoil might accumulate secularly rather than oscillate , and would be similar to the `` electromagnetic rocket '' in pulsars with off - centered magnetic dipole moments @xcite .",
    "we suspect that this effect occurs but it is likely small compared to the recoil from the final plunge and merger .",
