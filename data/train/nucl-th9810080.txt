    "the purpose of these lectures is to define , explain , and exhibit the methods of large @xmath0 qcd for phenomenologists of both the nuclear and particle bent .",
    "several excellent reviews on this topic exist in the literature , each with a different emphasis , and to each i am indebted for aspects of the pedagogy presented in the current work .",
    "witten s article on large @xmath0 baryons@xcite , one of my favorite papers , actually begins with a review of large @xmath0 mesons .",
    "chapter 8 in coleman s _ aspects of symmetry_@xcite covers the development of large @xmath0 through 1980 .",
    "many of the newer developments with baryons are included in manohar s 1997 les houches lectures@xcite and jenkins review@xcite .",
    "i assume that initially many readers may find the notion of large @xmath0 to be a rather exotic and unlikely approach to studying the strong interactions , as it seemed to me when i began to learn it some years ago . as always with an unfamiliar topic , it is important to start with clear definitions and motivations .",
    "we begin with the assertion that qcd - like theories possess a peculiar limit in which the physics of the strong interactions becomes much simpler .",
    "it is the so - called _ large @xmath0 limit _ , in which the number of color charges , @xmath0 (= 3 in our universe ) is taken as a free parameter ( _ i.e. _ , the gauge group is su(@xmath0 ) ) , and one considers the limit @xmath2 .",
    "physical quantities are then considered in this limit , where corrections appear at relative orders @xmath1 , @xmath3 , _ etc .",
    "_ , the _ @xmath1 expansion_. shortly after its discovery by t  hooft@xcite in 1974 , the method was applied to mesons with many qualitative successes in explaining phenomenology .",
    "however , it has only been in the past several years that much success has come in the analysis of baryons , with much of it quantitative .    however , before a detailed discussion of these very interesting points",
    ", it is important to consider some simple but incisive questions .",
    "how does large @xmath0 work ?",
    "what does it predict ? and",
    ", perhaps most importantly , is it believable ?    in this section , we discuss how and why large @xmath0 should work , and how it is implemented at the very basic level of qcd , in terms of quarks and gluons . to start with",
    ", the very notion of the approach creates an interesting paradox : how can increasing the number @xmath0 of degrees of freedom actually simplify the strong interaction problem ?",
    "it is certainly true that the detailed interactions of any particular quark or gluon become much more complicated if one insists on solving the theory exactly . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us introduce two analogies ; we shall come to appreciate that they represent the way large @xmath0 works for mesons and baryons , respectively .",
    "the first analogy is that of a particle moving in a complicated potential , one that requires many parameters for a complete description , and the second is the many - body problem in mechanics .",
    "both are difficult because of the large number of available dynamical degrees of freedom . however , if increasing the number of degrees of freedom permits one to consider only _ collective _ couplings in a systematic way , then the form of the dynamics simplifies . in the first analogy",
    ", the potential might be decomposable into a simple dominant piece ( which nonetheless originates from a large number of more fundamental interactions ) , while the other portions are subleading perturbations . in the second , statistical mechanics",
    "describes the system s gross features in terms of just a few collective quantities , such as temperature or volume ; fluctuations about these values are highly suppressed .    with these qualitative arguments in mind , what is special about the large @xmath0 limit of qcd in particular ?    1 .",
    "_ it is a perturbative qcd expansion . _",
    "compare qcd to qed ; why does the latter work so much better ?",
    "obviously , @xmath4 is a perturbative expansion parameter , while @xmath5 at hadronic energy scales is clearly not perturbative . at high energies",
    ", @xmath6 runs to smaller values due to asymptotic freedom , but one would prefer a perturbative parameter that works at _ all _ scales .",
    "in fact , only one such parameter is known to exist for qcd - like theories , namely , @xmath1 .",
    "physics simplifies in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "_ as we show presently , certain classes of feynman diagrams dominate over others in physical amplitudes , and this organization leads to many interesting simplifications .",
    "for example , we shall see that a color singlet @xmath7 pair always appears at leading order in @xmath1 as a single meson .",
    "it provides an explanation of phenomena hard or impossible to explain in field theory .",
    "_ for example , ozi suppression and the physical dominance of resonant - mediated processes are consequences of large @xmath0 , as we shall see .",
    "_ it seems to work , even for @xmath8 .",
    "_ this is perhaps the most startling reason ; indeed , one might expect that @xmath9 is too large to be a reasonable expansion parameter",
    ". however , such an objection may be answered in two ways .",
    "one is described by coleman@xcite as witten s `` wisecrack '' : consider @xmath10 , which leads to @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath1 is too large an expansion parameter , why do nt we say the same thing about the qed charge @xmath12 ? turning the argument around , one can find cases where the expansion parameter turns out to be @xmath13 , which is more satisfactory to some critics of the approach .",
    "however , i prefer a much more pragmatic answer , which is just that one should perform a given calculation with @xmath0 a free parameter , set it to 3 at the end of the day , and see for oneself whether or not the factors of 3 are supported by the experimental measurements .",
    "the ultimate justification of any approach in this view is whether it successfully explains physical observations and can be tested in new situations .    before proceeding ,",
    "consider the evidence that @xmath14 in our universe ; it is important to check that there is nothing fundamentally immutable about this particular value that would impede consideration of larger @xmath0 .",
    "historically , the original reason for the invention of color@xcite was to explain how fermionic baryons could have a completely symmetric spin - flavor - space wavefunction , as suggested by experiment .",
    "a canonical example is @xmath15 , which is completely symmetric under spin - flavor indices . since the spatial wavefunction for this low - lying state is expected to be completely symmetric ,",
    "so is the combined spin - flavor - space wavefunction , and therefore one requires a new degree of freedom with ( at least ) 3 values completely antisymmetric under quark exchange .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the color idea came with the measurement of the ratio @xmath16 away from thresholds for new flavor production , which is found , as originally predicted@xcite , to be a factor of 3 larger than what one would predict from a colorless quark theory . similarly , perturbative qcd , in those high - energy kinematic regimes where it is believed valid , only gives results in agreement with experiment when one sets @xmath8 . furthermore",
    ", the calculated rate for @xmath17 , which matches experiment , includes a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "finally , the standard model is only renormalizable if the particle content is chosen to eliminate the possibility of chiral anomalies . in particular , since quark charges are known from deep inelastic scattering experiments to be integral multiples of 1/3 , one can show that chiral anomalies cancel only for the choice @xmath8 . for universes with larger values of @xmath0 , the cancellation of anomalies",
    "is accomplished by adjusting the quark charges accordingly , to be integral multiples of @xmath1 .    with these lessons in mind ,",
    "let us consider the valence structure of hadrons in large @xmath0 .",
    "in order to make progress , we first make the crucial assumption that color confinement occurs for arbitrarily large @xmath0 ; otherwise , such a universe bears no resemblance to ours , since then free colored hadrons or even free quarks can be abundant .",
    "such an assumption is not required , of course , since the physical extrapolation from @xmath8 to @xmath18 might lead from a confining to a nonconfining phase at some value of @xmath19 , but then the large @xmath0 limit would be of little phenomenological value since we have no empirical knowledge of nonconfining strong interactions .",
    "mesons of valence flavor structure @xmath20 with color indices @xmath21 , @xmath22 for arbitrary @xmath0 have the normalized wavefunction @xmath23 where @xmath24 serves to combine the @xmath25 pair into a color singlet .",
    "the salient point is that mesons still have the quantum numbers of a system with a single quark and a single antiquark for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "baryons , on the other hand , are built in analogy with the @xmath14 observation that fermionic states with completely symmetric spin - flavor - space wavefunctions require at least as many colors as quarks .",
    "on the other hand , once we specify that there are @xmath0 colors , su(@xmath0 ) group theory requires a minimum of @xmath0 colored quarks to form a color singlet .",
    "therefore , large @xmath0 baryons require exactly @xmath0 valence quarks . given the valence quarks @xmath26 , the normalized wavefunction including color indices @xmath27 is @xmath28 furthermore , only odd @xmath0 produces fermionic baryons , since each of the @xmath0 quarks has spin 1/2 .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit may be used equally well to consider even-@xmath0 bosonic baryons , but of course these are not phenomenologically relevant .",
    "we are now ready to consider large @xmath0 qcd itself , as developed by t  hooft . to the non - initiate who has been told of large @xmath0 results but never taught its origins , the whole idea might still seem a bit like necromancy .",
    "but like any good magic show , the essential predictive power of large @xmath0 just comes from trap doors ( topology ) and mirrors ( group theory ) .",
    "let us begin with the usual particle content of qcd with the color gauge group su(@xmath0 ) .",
    "quarks carry a color index in the fundamental representation of the group , which means that the standard representation is a column vector @xmath29 with @xmath0 components , one for each color .",
    "diagrammatically , it is represented by an arrowed line .",
    "antiquarks carry a color index in the fundamental conjugate , or anti - fundamental , representation , and therefore appear in standard form as a row vector @xmath30 with @xmath0 components .",
    "they are also drawn as arrowed lines , but the ( anti- ) color flow is understood to be opposite the direction of the arrow .",
    "gluons , which appear in the adjoint representation of su(@xmath0 ) , carry one color and one anti - color index , and appear in standard form as traceless @xmath31 matrices @xmath32 , which can be drawn as two parallel lines whose arrows point in opposite directions .",
    "this is called t  hooft s _ double - line notation _ ; counting as another type of gluon .",
    "second , the double - line notation is strictly accurate for the gauge group u(@xmath0 ) rather than su(@xmath0 ) .",
    "what about the extra u(1 ) gluon ?",
    "since it is only one gluon out of @xmath33 , one can show@xcite that it always gives diagrams subleading by at least two powers of @xmath0 . ]",
    "it is actually extraordinarily convenient in capturing the color physics , because exact color conservation implies that color lines are continuous , while the confinement assumption means that color lines form only closed loops .",
    "the three qcd vertices in double - line notation are depicted in fig .",
    "[ vert ] .",
    "the double - line notation is particularly useful as a guide to developing an understanding of how the qcd gauge parameter , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 = strong ) , scales as @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , as t  hooft argued in his original paper@xcite , qcd green functions only have smooth , finite limits as @xmath2 if @xmath36 .",
    "since this is such a central result in the analysis to come , we prove the claim in detail below .",
    "however , let us ponder for a moment why such a result is interesting . given that @xmath36 , one can show that certain classes of feynman diagrams dominate over others , in possessing fewer powers of @xmath1 , an organization known as _",
    "large @xmath0 power counting_. the dominant class of graphs is denoted _ planar _ , which means that these graphs can be drawn in the double - line notation in the plane of paper , with any quark line ( if one is present ) placed on the perimeter , and with color lines arranged to cross only at vertices .",
    "each nonplanarity , as will be shown , costs a suppression factor of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , diagrams with no internal quark loops dominate over the others , in that each internal quark loop costs a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "so , in summary , large @xmath0 counting provides an organization of all feynman diagrams into a well - defined and countable hierarchy of classes .",
    "we now present a proof of t  hooft s scaling of @xmath34 .",
    "vertices typically fall into three types .",
    "there are bilinears that create @xmath25 pairs from the vacuum , and are accompanied by @xmath37 ; let there be @xmath38 of these _ current insertions_. gluons , for which gauge invariance requires including a factor @xmath39 , but such vertices can also be shown to satisfy the counting rules . ]",
    "each of @xmath40 trilinear ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) vertices includes @xmath43 , while each of @xmath44 quartic vertices includes @xmath45 .",
    "confinement requires that the @xmath46 color lines in the digram completely close ; then one may choose any of the @xmath0 colors to appear on each loop , providing a combinatoric factor of @xmath47 .",
    "in total , then , the diagram scales as @xmath48 since the diagram has no external lines by color confinement , both ends of each propagator @xmath49 terminate on a vertex : @xmath50 defining the total number of vertices @xmath51 one has @xmath52 it is very fruitful to use the double - line notation to interpret the diagram as a polyhedron , much like a geodesic roof .",
    "each color loop @xmath46 becomes a _ face _",
    ", where each propagator @xmath49 is an _",
    "edge _ and each vertex @xmath53 of the diagram is also a _",
    "vertex _ of the solid figure",
    ". then each quark loop , which possesses one less color line than if it were replaced by a ( double - line ) gluon loop , may be thought of as a missing face , or topological _ boundary _ @xmath54 , while each nonplanar line may be interpreted as a handle ( since it represents one edge forced to pass in front of another but not meet at a vertex ) , or topological unit of _ genus _ @xmath55 .",
    "we relate these features to topological objects so that we may now use a famous theorem due to euler : for each orientabledouble - line diagrams are orientable , _",
    "i.e. _ , possess a well - defined and continuous definition of normal vector to their surfaces , and hence , an inside and outside .",
    "this is because each double - line edge has one arrow pointing in either direction : recall that such a feature is used when proving stokes theorem in calculus . in turn , this feature of the double - line notation comes from using su(@xmath0 ) as a gauge group , where gluons may be thought of as having ( quark + antiquark ) quantum numbers .",
    "the same would not be true in , _",
    "e.g. _ , o(@xmath0 ) . ]",
    "figure , there is a topological invariant called the euler character @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57 therefore , @xmath58^{2 - 2g - b } .\\ ] ] the first term still depends on the particular diagram , while the second has a purely topological power .",
    "now observe that , if @xmath34 falls off faster than @xmath59 , then diagrams of any given topology with the fewest color loops , and hence a minimal number of gluons , dominate ; but this is a trivial theory , in that only valence diagrams are important .",
    "clearly the gluon degrees of freedom are vital to understanding the strong interaction , so we reject this possibility . on the other hand , if @xmath34 falls off slower than @xmath59 ,",
    "then diagrams of any given topology with the most color loops dominate ; but this is a nonsense theory , for one can always add more color loops to diagrams of a given topology , and in this scenario one could make no predictions at all .",
    "however , we know that this is not the case , since perturbative qcd in high - energy regimes works well . we conclude that @xmath36 is the only nontrivial , sensible large @xmath0 scaling , qcd to satisfy the conditions of nontriviality and sensibility , but if it does not , one can not extrapolate from @xmath2 back to @xmath8 and hope to make predictions . ] giving the result @xmath60 meaning that the large @xmath0 counting of any particular diagram is purely topological . since this is the case , for any given diagram one may add an arbitrarily large number of planar gluons and remain within the same topological class , _",
    "i.e. _ , the diagram maintains the same large @xmath0 counting .",
    "however , each additional quark loop or nonplanar gluon adds one unit to @xmath54 or @xmath55 , leading to an additional @xmath1 or @xmath3 suppression , respectively .",
    "another ( although actually equivalent ) way to demonstrate @xmath61 is to start with the qcd renormalization group equation , @xmath62 where @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the number of light quark flavors , and the positivity of @xmath65 being the reason we know that qcd is asymptotically free .",
    "let us rescale @xmath66 , with @xmath67 finite as @xmath2 .",
    "then ( [ rge ] ) reads @xmath68 we immediately see that , if @xmath69 , @xmath67 is constant and @xmath34 instantly runs to zero for @xmath0 large ( assuming that the theory has a perturbative limit ) , leading to a trivial theory of valence diagrams only ; on the other hand , if @xmath70 , @xmath67 runs infinitely fast , making a nonsense theory with no meaningful predictions .",
    "again , we conclude that only @xmath36 leads to a nontrivial and sensible theory .",
    "we conclude this section by illustrating in figs .",
    "[ topo1 ] and [ topo2 ] the large @xmath0 counting in the three different approaches : counting powers of @xmath34 and @xmath0 , counting features of the equivalent polyhedra , and counting topological invariants .",
    "these examples should provide the reader with hands - on experience with the theorems we have considered .",
    "having shown that the large @xmath0 limit of qcd is only nontrivial and sensible if @xmath36 , and that feynman diagrams involving quarks and gluons fall into classes labeled by powers of @xmath0 with planar diagrams at leading order , what have we gained ?",
    "certainly , the observed strongly interacting particles are hadrons rather than quarks and gluons , and so if there were no obvious relation between the two pictures  beyond the valence quark model , which unlike large @xmath0 contains no explicit gluons  large @xmath0 would hold little phenomenological interest .",
    "but in fact one can derive an elegant and simple large @xmath0 relationship between hadrons and their fundamental qcd constituents . in this section",
    ", we consider this derivation and its consequences for mesons .",
    "a good starting point for these discussions is to consider the particle spectrum of large @xmath0 . in our @xmath14 world , one observes _",
    "conventional mesons _ with the quantum numbers of @xmath25 , baryons with the quantum numbers of @xmath71 , and more recently , _ hybrid mesons_@xcite with the quantum numbers of ( @xmath25 + gluons ) . on the other hand",
    ", one might equally well expect to see _ glueballs _ , which are defined as mesons containing all gluons and no valence quarks , exotic _",
    "multiquark mesons _ with the quantum numbers of ( @xmath25 + extra @xmath25 pairs ) , _ exotic baryons _ with the quantum numbers of ( @xmath71 + extra @xmath25 pairs ) , and _ hybrid baryons _ , with the quantum numbers of ( @xmath71 + glue ) .",
    "members of the latter class have not yet been observed , and with the exception of hybrid baryons , large @xmath0 provides an explanation .    to see how it works , first consider qcd two - point diagrams as depicted in figs .",
    "[ topo1 ] , [ topo2 ] .",
    "the current @xmath72 creates a @xmath25 pair from the qcd vacuum at some spacetime point , the quarks propagate and interact for some interval , and then the pair is annihilated by a current @xmath73 .",
    "we ask , what kinds of hadrons can appear in the intermediate state ?",
    "equivalently , using our confinement assumption , we want to discover what color - singlet combinations of quarks and gluons are revealed if we cut the diagram at any convenient place .",
    "we claim that , to leading order in @xmath1 , cutting such a diagram leads only to a single @xmath25 meson  no multiquark mesons , no glueballs .",
    "the proof of this statement relies on planar diagrams with no internal quark loops ( which alone eliminates multiquark mesons from our discussion ) dominating in the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "typical planar diagrams in the double - line notation are those exhibited in fig .",
    "[ topo1 ] .",
    "the unique feature possessed by planar diagrams and no others is that , when cut , each color index appears adjacent to its corresponding anticolor index .",
    "that is , one cuts through an entire color loop before passing to the next one . in terms of fields , the equivalent ( perhaps nonlocal ) operator has color structure @xmath74 in terms of the generators of color indices , one may use the usual gell - mann matrices @xmath75 to expose the underlying structure @xmath76 now one uses a little su(@xmath0 ) group theory to complete the proof . a particularly convenient way to do this",
    "is to exhibit the commutation relations obeyed by the generators : @xmath77 = 2if^{abc } \\lambda^c , \\hspace{2em } \\left\\ { \\lambda^a , \\lambda^b \\right\\ } = \\frac{4}{n_c } \\delta^{ab } + 2d^{abc } \\lambda^c .\\ ] ] combining these , @xmath78 where the first term , which is color singlet , is suppressed by @xmath1 , while the second term , which is color adjoint like the original gluons , is of leading order , @xmath79 . by induction , every string of gluon fields is color adjoint to leading order , and therefore the only way to make a leading - order color singlet from the diagram is to take the operator @xmath80 as an irreducible whole .",
    "the conclusion is that only a single meson , and no glueballs or multiquark mesons , appear at leading order in @xmath1 .",
    "this important result can now be used to prove a wide variety of consequences .",
    "since each planar two - point diagram with a @xmath81 pair appears as a single meson , the sum of planar two - point diagrams with momentum transfer @xmath82 must also equal a sum of meson propagators , @xmath83 where @xmath84 , the @xmath85th meson decay constant , is defined as the transition amplitude between meson state @xmath85 and the vacuum through the current @xmath72 . using that @xmath82 is arbitrary and that the equality must hold for any ( sufficiently large ) value of @xmath0",
    ", one finds that @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath82 very large , the diagram must approach its perturbative qcd result , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the renormalization point .",
    "however , no finite sum of factors @xmath90 produces a logarithm in @xmath82 , so the number of meson states in large @xmath0 must be infinite .",
    "since one may restrict this calculation to diagrams of a given fixed @xmath91 , it is also true that the number of mesons of any particular quantum numbers is also infinite .",
    "one may continue in this fashion to consider three- , four- , and higher - point functions .",
    "the diagrams in these cases resemble those of the two - point function , except for the inclusion of more current insertions , and thus are all @xmath92 .",
    "however , unlike in the two - point diagram , there is now more than one way to collect the quark and gluon fields into color singlets .",
    "for example , for the three - point function , each of the three current insertions may create a meson , which annihilate at a trilinear meson vertex ( fig .",
    "[ 3pt ] ) .",
    "alternately , one current insertion may create two mesons , which propagate to the remaining two insertions .",
    "the three - point diagram is then given by @xmath93 using that @xmath94 , @xmath95 , one discovers that the 3-meson vertex scales as @xmath59 , while the amplitude to create 2 mesons scales as @xmath96 .    diagrams with more current insertions allow for more types of internal meson vertices , and the @xmath0 scaling behavior of each type of vertex can be derived inductively . for example",
    ", meson vertices from the four - point function can be obtained by using results from the two- and three - point functions . in general , given an @xmath97-point function , each possible @xmath85-point diagram , @xmath98 , is required to appear with the large @xmath0 scaling derived in a previous induction step ( a statement of unitarity ) with all possible permutations of meson propagators ( a statement of crossing symmetry ) .",
    "one finds in this way the general results that both the @xmath97-meson vertex and the amplitude to create @xmath97 mesons from the vacuum scale as @xmath99 .",
    "this important result appears to have been first obtained by veneziano@xcite .",
    "such a scaling implies immediately that mesons are free , since the propagator , _",
    "i.e. _ , the `` two - meson vertex , '' scales as @xmath96 , and therefore neither blows up nor vanishes as @xmath18 , while the @xmath59 scaling of the three - meson vertex , and the additional @xmath100 suppression for each additional meson , implies that mesons are stable  a remarkable result !",
    "but , could mixing with possible exotic states spoil this reasoning ?",
    "we now discuss the fate of exotics to show that this does not occur .",
    "first consider glueballs ; for simplicity , depict those with only two valence gluons , whose two - point diagrams resemble those of figs .  [ topo1 ] and [ topo2 ] , except that the exterior quark is replaced by a gluon .",
    "then all the large @xmath0 counting is the same as before , except that the single color line of the quark is replaced by the double line of the gluon .",
    "therefore , each diagram is a factor of @xmath0 larger , so that the planar diagrams scale as @xmath33 .",
    "the same proof as for mesons shows that these diagrams are dominated by the one - glueball state , and so one finds that the masses and decay constants of glueballs scale as @xmath96 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "continuing with the same logic as before , the @xmath102-glueball vertex scales as @xmath103 .    as for glueball - meson mixing , the simplest planar diagram for the process",
    "is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ gluemesmix ] . converting it to double - line format , we find two color loops and two factors of @xmath34 , so that the diagram scales as @xmath101 .",
    "using our previous results for the glueball and meson decay constants of @xmath101 and @xmath100 , which appear at the current insertions , we see that the glueball - meson coupling scales as @xmath59 , meaning that glueballs and mesons do not mix at leading order .",
    "therefore , glueballs and mesons are _ separately _ free , stable particles as @xmath2 , with the combined result that the @xmath102-glueball , @xmath97-meson vertex for @xmath104 scales as @xmath105 .",
    "next consider multiquark mesons , _",
    "e.g. _ , those with valence quantum numbers @xmath106 .",
    "these are created by current insertions of the form @xmath107 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ multi ] . to leading order in @xmath1 , the color loops close either as ( 1,2 ) , ( 3,4 ) or ( 1,4 ) , ( 2,3 ) .",
    "this means that the diagram has two distinct closed color loops and scales as @xmath33 ; however , we know from our previous reasoning that each such loop is a single meson to leading order in @xmath1 . to create a single meson with @xmath106 quantum numbers requires an _ irreducible _ color loop , such as ( 1,2,3,4 ) or ( 1,4,3,2 ) ; however , such a diagram scales as @xmath101 and is thus subleading .",
    "we conclude that multiquark mesons are suppressed in @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we turn our attention to hybrid mesons . from the previous paragraphs",
    ", one might expect that we shall dispose of these as well .",
    "but , in fact , they are present in the large @xmath0 limit@xcite . to see this diagrammatically , consider hybrids of valence structure @xmath108 ; one simple planar diagram representing their propagation is given in fig .",
    "[ hyb]@xmath109 .",
    "one finds two color loops and two factors of @xmath34 , meaning that such diagrams scale as @xmath101 , the same as the leading conventional valence meson diagrams as in figs .",
    "[ topo1 ] , [ topo2 ] .",
    "in particular , one finds that hybrid mesons have masses of @xmath79 and decay constants of @xmath110 , exactly like those of conventional mesons . as for meson - hybrid mixing ,",
    "one leading diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "[ hyb]@xmath111 , which has two color loops and two factors of @xmath34 , thus scaling as @xmath101 .",
    "of course , the symmetries of spacetime require that the conventional and hybrid mesons in this case must share the same quantum numbers . using that both conventional and hybrid mesons have decay constants scaling as @xmath100",
    ", one sees that the meson - hybrid coupling is @xmath79 , so that the two mix freely in large @xmath0 .",
    "an equivalent observation is that _ all _ mesons in large @xmath0 are expected to have a finite hybrid component , and the large @xmath0 limit sheds no light on the mystery of why almost all observed mesons have only the quantum numbers of conventional mesons .",
    "it should also be noted that hybrids with exotic ( non-@xmath81 ) quantum numbers ( such as the newly - observed @xmath112 ) do not mix with conventional mesons at leading order in @xmath1 , but are nonetheless not hard to create .",
    "the leading three - point diagrams allow for one or more of the current insertions to have exotic quantum numbers , which means that the process of exotic meson production occurs at the same order in @xmath0 as that of conventional mesons .",
    "glueballs , on the other hand , are harder to create from meson sources and slower to decay in the large @xmath0 limit ; we leave the verification of these facts as an opportunity for the reader to experiment with double - line diagrams .    in summary",
    ", our analysis of the large @xmath0 meson spectrum teaches that , for the phenomenology of conventional mesons , one may ignore glueballs , multiquark states , and hybrids with exotic quantum numbers . on the other hand , hybrids with conventional quantum numbers",
    "should be treated just like conventional valence mesons .",
    "the general multiparticle vertex for @xmath102 glueballs , @xmath97 mesons , and @xmath113 hybrids scales as @xmath114 for @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "when @xmath117 , the exponent is @xmath118 .",
    "the physical mesons , which contain a hybrid component , are _ free _ , since the propagator scales as @xmath96 ; _ stable _ , since the 3-meson vertex is @xmath119 , and _ non - interacting _ , since meson - meson scattering , _",
    "i.e. _ the 4-meson vertex , is @xmath120 .    in general , one concludes that diagrams with the fewest mesons allowed tend to dominate physical processes .",
    "this immediately gives a field - theoretic explanation of the dominance of resonance - mediated decays and the existence of excited mesons narrow enough to measure .",
    "although one could imagine an alternative strong interaction in which every mesonic process with a substantial amount of energy release simply produced a spray of pions and nothing else , the real strong interaction very definitely produces a rich and complex spectrum of observable resonances .",
    "large @xmath0 qcd gives an extraordinarily economical explanation for this basic observation .",
    "one success of the large @xmath0 limit is the ozi rule@xcite , that meson processes requiring the annihilation or @xmath25 pairs , or equivalently , the presence of an all - glue intermediate state , are phenomenologically suppressed .",
    "the canonical example is the decay of the @xmath121 meson , which is believed to have the valence structure @xmath122 .",
    "it decays into a @xmath123 pair , for which there is almost no phase space ( @xmath124 gev ) 83% of the time , but only 17% of the time into @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and other nonstrange modes , for which there is much more available phase space .",
    "apparently , @xmath122 annihilation is suppressed , and large @xmath0 offers a very simple explanation : a decay like @xmath127 may be represented with a standard , leading - order ( @xmath92 ) three - point diagram as we have discussed , but annihilating the strange quark closes its quark color loop and requires another to create the light hadrons in the final state .",
    "since each quark loop costs a factor of @xmath1 , the leading ozi - suppressed diagrams inherit this suppression .",
    "is much more subtle , as real ozi suppression appears to have interesting dynamical origins above and beyond the mere factor of @xmath9 : see @xcite . ]",
    "the observed fact that mesons appear in nonets of flavor su(3 ) rather than octets , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the flavor octet and singlet mesons tend to mix and have comparable masses , is another success of large @xmath0 .",
    "the canonical example is @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which are the mass eigenstates of mixing between a flavor singlet @xmath130 and flavor octet @xmath131 ; _ a priori _ , the @xmath130 could have turned out much heavier than @xmath131 .",
    "however , one can show that diagrams differentiating between their masses either break su(3 ) , large @xmath0 , or both . to see this ,",
    "begin in the su(3 ) flavor limit where @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath35 quarks are not distinguished .",
    "then all planar two - point diagrams such as in fig .",
    "[ topo1 ] contribute equally to both masses , but a diagram with pure glue intermediates contributes to @xmath134 alone , since gluons , like @xmath130 , are flavor singlets . because the latter diagrams are suppressed by @xmath1 , one concludes that terms symmetric in su(3 ) that distinguish the masses  which _ a priori _ could have been large  are in fact suppressed by @xmath1 effects : @xmath135 as a final example of mesonic applications of large @xmath0 , consider the famous t  hooft model@xcite . by definition ,",
    "the t  hooft model is large @xmath0 qcd in 1 space and 1 time dimension ( 1 + 1 ) . although it is called a model",
    ", it is actually a full - fledged quantum field theory that is exactly soluble , in that all hadronic green functions may be obtained entirely in terms of quark degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , one can compute meson masses precisely in terms of quark masses .",
    "furthermore , the only asymptotically free states in the theory are confined , color - singlet hadrons , which appear in an infinite tower of increasing masses .",
    "so , although we assumed confinement in large @xmath0 qcd in 3 + 1 dimensions , it appears to be an immediate consequence in 1 + 1 .",
    "such a result might be expected based upon naive dimensional analysis . for , consider the momentum space potential derived from a single gluon exchange propagator in the instantaneous approximation : @xmath136 and fourier transform to position space . in 3 + 1 dimensions , one has @xmath137 , the usual coulomb interaction , which is asymptotically free as @xmath138 ; in 1 + 1 , @xmath139 , which confines as @xmath138 . that the confining potential survives relativistic and field theory corrections is , however , nontrivial .",
    "the t  hooft model is soluble precisely because of the two features of its definition .",
    "large @xmath0 guarantees that nonplanar gluons and virtual quark loops are suppressed , while working in 1 + 1 allows one to choose gauges for the gluon field such that gluon - gluon couplings vanish .",
    "such terms arise in minimal substitution from the commutator @xmath140 $ ] term ; working in a gauge such that one of the two components of @xmath141 vanishes guarantees that the commutator does also .",
    "the only remaining diagrams are `` rainbow '' and `` ladder '' types ( fig .",
    "[ thdiag ] ) and these can be summed using `` bootstrap''-type schwinger - dyson equations , essentially the same trick that is used to sum the geometric series .    performing this summation for the green function of a @xmath81 system , one obtains the meson wavefunction @xmath142 in terms of the _",

    "the quark masses are renormalized by @xmath149 from which we note that the 1 + 1 strong coupling @xmath34 actually has dimensions of mass , and using that @xmath150 , it is natural to describe masses in units of @xmath151 .",
    "such a quantity acts in the same way in 1 + 1 as @xmath152 in 3 + 1 , in that it distinguishes `` heavy '' from `` light '' quarks .",
    "the t  hooft equation is known to possess an infinite tower of solutions , labeled by @xmath153 , which alternate in parity ( @xmath154 ) . as @xmath155 ,",
    "the meson masses scale as @xmath156 .",
    "since @xmath145 is bounded between 0 and 1 , the t  hooft equation is qualitatively similar to the quantum mechanical problem of a particle in a box .",
    "the utility of the t  hooft model is that it can be used to study difficult problems of qcd that have not been fully solved in 3 + 1 , such as the meson form factors , deep inelastic scattering , and the saturation of hadronic rates by partonic diagrams .",
    "for example , consider@xcite the nonleptonic weak decay of a meson containing a heavy quark into lighter mesons . as the heavy quark mass @xmath144 is increased",
    ", the light antiquark and gluon degrees of freedom should exert less and less influence on the decay of the heavy quark , and eventually the process should be well described by the diagram of _ free _ heavy quark weak decay . since one can compute both the hadronic and partonic decay rates in the t  hooft model , the two can be compared directly . the result is fig .",
    "[ glfig ] , in which one sees that the two rates rapidly approach one another for large @xmath144 .",
    "recalling from sec .  i that baryons for quarks of @xmath0 colors have the quantum numbers of @xmath0 quarks ,",
    "one is immediately faced with the dilemma of how to understand the physics of a system with @xmath2 constituents .",
    "a particularly simple and elegant paradigm for dealing with this situation is the mean - field hartree - fock baryon picture due to witten@xcite , in which each quark moves in the field caused by the other @xmath157 quarks acting collectively .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath1 , this field is static  after all , a system of @xmath157 quarks possesses a great deal of inertia compared to a single quark .",
    "then each quark in the ground state satisfies the same field - theoretical wave equation ( which , for very heavy quarks , reduces to the schrdinger equation ) ; although the exact form of this wave equation depends upon the details of qcd and is therefore unknown , much can be said from its existence and its large @xmath0 scaling properties .    for starters , since each quark in the ground state satisfies the same wave equation , each one has the same wavefunction @xmath158 , which we claim scales as @xmath96 . for the scaling claim to be sensible , the potential due to the other @xmath157 quarks in which each of the @xmath0 quarks moves must also scale as @xmath96 , or equivalently , baryon diagrams must never give interaction energies more than @xmath92 . to see that this is true",
    ", one must first understand large @xmath0 counting for baryon diagrams .",
    "the potential comes from diagrams with connected interactions such as those depicted in fig .",
    "[ bary1 ] .",
    "in addition to factors of @xmath0 from @xmath36 and color loops , one has combinatoric factors due to the presence of @xmath0 quark lines .",
    "for example , diagrams involving two quarks can be chosen in @xmath159 ways , diagrams involving three quarks can be chosen in @xmath160 ways , and so forth .",
    "the three diagrams in fig .",
    "[ bary1 ] are all seen to appear at @xmath92 , and so are among the leading - order diagrams .",
    "it is not hard to prove that no diagrams are of lower order , and that internal quark loops and nonplanar gluons ( see appendix  [ planar ] ) cost factors of @xmath1 , meaning that a consistent large @xmath0 counting scheme compatible with the hartree - fock picture does indeed exist for the baryons .",
    "since @xmath158 is the same for each quark in the baryon , it follows that each quark has the same charge distribution and occupies the same space ; therefore , baryons remain the same size as @xmath2 . in contrast , large @xmath141 nuclei grow in size with @xmath141 because of the phenomenological saturation of nuclear forces .",
    "whereas large @xmath0 baryons and large @xmath141 nuclei both have masses proportional to the numbers of constituents @xmath0 and @xmath141 , respectively , large @xmath0 baryons are like rigid containers with radius @xmath161 and density @xmath162 , while large @xmath141 nuclei are like close - packed spheres with density @xmath163 and radius @xmath164 .",
    "this is why the hartree - fock picture works for baryons but not nuclei .    within the hartree - fock picture it is possible to obtain large @xmath0 behavior for common physical processes .",
    "for example , consider ( fig .",
    "[ scat ] ) baryon - baryon ( @xmath165 ) and baryon - meson ( @xmath166 ) scattering . in the @xmath165 case",
    ", one may choose from among @xmath0 quarks in each baryon , while at least one gluon is typically required to keep both baryons color singlets and conserve momentum , providing a factor @xmath167 .",
    "the amplitude for the process thus scales as @xmath101 . in the @xmath166 case ,",
    "the counting proceeds as before , except that one loses one of the @xmath101 combinatoric factors , meaning that the amplitude scales as @xmath96 .",
    "do these factors make sense ? for @xmath165 , since baryon masses are @xmath92 , an amplitude of @xmath92 leads , via the usual textbook formulae , to a nonvanishing , finite ( @xmath79 ) cross - section . for @xmath166 ,",
    "since meson masses are @xmath79 , the cross - section formulae lead to the scattering of the meson  but not the baryon  with @xmath79 probability ; the physical picture in this case is the meson scattering from a fixed potential center .",
    "particles per unit volume .",
    "although a mere bookkeeping device , this factor is @xmath79 in the large @xmath0 limit ( _ i.e. _ , not infinite like @xmath168 ) and therefore gives the standard result for scattering from a potential center in the @xmath166 case as @xmath2 . ]",
    "although the hartree - fock picture provides a simple archetype for the large @xmath0 baryon , its value is limited since it only describes the leading - order @xmath0 counting for a given process .",
    "this was also the case for the mesons , but now with @xmath0 constituents in the baryon , it becomes possible to perform studies of subleading effects in @xmath1 , which involve some subset of the quarks acting collectively . in the next two subsections , we shall discuss the two known techniques for studying the subleading @xmath1 structure of baryons : _ consistency condition _ and _ spin - flavor algebra _ methods .",
    "both make use of an operator basis acting upon the baryon states , and so the bulk of the @xmath1 suppressions is carried by the operators .",
    "the remainder of this lecture is dedicated to explaining these two schemes and their phenomenological results .",
    "the consistency condition approach turns out to be related closely to an operator analysis based on the skyrme model@xcite , while the spin - flavor method turns out to be closely related to operator analysis performed in the quark model .",
    "the starting point of this scheme is to consider baryon - meson scattering not in terms of quarks , but rather hadrons .",
    "suppose that the meson is a @xmath169 , which , as a nambu - goldstone boson of chiral symmetry , couples to baryons derivatively through the isovector axial vector current @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is an isospin pauli matrix .",

    "note that only the space components of @xmath172 appear in the leading term of the nonrelativistic expansion of the quark bilinear , and only these are needed here , since at leading order in @xmath1 the baryon may be taken at rest throughout the process .",
    "this implies also that the @xmath169 scatters elastically from the baryon , and so in the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ conscat ] the baryon is off - shell by an amount @xmath176 , whereas in the second the amount is ( @xmath177 ) .",

    "one evades this conundrum by noting that many baryon states may appear on the intermediate line , _ i.e. _ , are inserted between the two @xmath182 s in the commutator ; then cancellations can render the matrix elements of the commutator @xmath120 even though matrix elements of each @xmath182 individually are @xmath79 , as pointed out by gervais and sakita in 1984@xcite .",
    "such cancellations are called _",
    "consistency conditions_.    the mathematics behind this approach was developed in the 1960s as one of many methods to study strong interactions , and is generically called the method of _ induced representations of a contracted spin - flavor algebra_. in order to explain this intimidating term , we first consider what is meant by a _ contracted algebra_. in essence , it means that one or more generators of an algebra is scaled so as to change the commutation relations . for example , perform a @xmath1 expansion of the operator @xmath182 : @xmath183 in terms of which we have seen that @xmath184 = 0.\\ ] ] by virtue of its defining indices @xmath185 and @xmath109 , @xmath175 is a spin-1 , isospin-1 tensor , and therefore by definition satisfies @xmath186 = i \\epsilon^{ijk } x_0^{kb } , \\hspace{2em } \\left [ i^a , x_0^{jb } \\right ] = i \\epsilon^{abc } x_0^{jc } .\\ ] ] also , as usual , @xmath187 = i \\epsilon^{ijk } j^k , \\hspace{2em } \\left [ i^a , i^b \\right ] = i \\epsilon^{abc } i^c , \\hspace{2em } \\left [ i^a , j^i \\right ] = 0 , \\ ] ] which are the defining relations of spin - flavor su(2 ) @xmath188 su(2 ) .",

    "this is the contraction of the spin - flavor algebra .",
    "one immediately concludes that , due to the contraction , the smaller spin - flavor symmetry su(2 ) @xmath188 su(2 ) is promoted to the larger symmetry su(4 ) , at leading order in @xmath1 . for three light flavors @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath35 , for which the flavor symmetry is su(3 )",

    "next , a representation of an algebra is _ induced _ when one attempts to specify the quantum numbers of a given state as classified according to a generator of the algebra , and discovers that other quantum numbers must be specified to label the state completely .",
    "this happens , for example , when one classifies the irreducible representations of the lorentz group ; once a given inertial frame ( _ i.e. _ , set of boost coordinates ) is chosen , one finds that there still exists a `` little group '' of transformations needed to specify the representation , which correspond physically to rotations in that frame : choosing the frame induces the full representation . in the present case ,",
    "once one specifies eigenvalues of the operator @xmath189 , one finds@xcite that there remains a `` little group '' of generators with quantum numbers @xmath195 , @xmath178 , like those of angular momentum , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 .",

    "for example , since the expansion breaks down if @xmath228 or @xmath229 , we take physical baryons to have @xmath230 and @xmath231 . as for the strangeness content , consider for example the top - right entry of the multiplet fig .  [ spin12 ] ; its spin - flavor structure is @xmath232 in a total spin-1/2 , isospin-1/2 state ( just as for an @xmath14 proton ) plus @xmath233 @xmath234 pairs , each combined into spin-0 , isospin-0 quantum numbers .",
    "it is tempting to identify this state as the @xmath235 analogue of the proton , and one may do this by fiat ; indeed , in light of our statements above , the physical proton should have @xmath236 even for @xmath235 . apart from the top - right state , the physical proton might occupy any of a number of sites in fig .",

    "however , each of these states contains a number of @xmath35 quarks , which are heavier than @xmath132 and @xmath133 quarks , and therefore these baryons should be heavier than those on the top row . if the physical proton contains some valence @xmath35 quarks , it decays weakly to some other lighter baryon , a process that opens up a phenomenological pandora s box .",
    "one does not encounter any of these or similar problems if one identifies the physical baryons to lie at the tops of figs .",
    "[ spin12 ] and [ spin32 ] .    even taking these assignments into account",
    ", some of the operators , such as @xmath237 and @xmath238 , can still give matrix elements of @xmath239 , even when evaluated only on the physical baryons .",
    "all is not lost , however , since we have not to this point made full use of the mathematics .",
    "since the operators can be thought of as a set of vectors spanning the space of physical observables , it must be that there are only as many independent operators as independent observables .",
    "one can obtain a number of _ operator reduction rules_@xcite based upon both the structure of the spin - flavor algebra su(@xmath214 ) and properties particular to the completely symmetric ground - state representation .    to see how this works , collect the su(@xmath214 ) generators into a uniformly normalized set : @xmath240 then two simple operator reduction relations are @xmath241 equation ( [ orr1 ] ) is actually nothing more than the total quark number operator in the baryon , which of course produces a factor @xmath0 . the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ orr2 ] ) by definition is the quadratic casimir of su(@xmath214 ) in the same way that @xmath242 is the casimir of spin su(2 ) , and therefore is also proportional to the identity operator .",
    "note in both cases how each reduction by one operator leads to an additional power of @xmath0 ; it is this feature that maintains the consistency of large @xmath0 counting within the operator reduction rules .",
    "once the complete set of such rules is known , one may produce a minimal set of independent operators to any given order in the @xmath1 expansion to describe a given physical quantity .",
    "analysis of the mass spectrum  @xcite provides a good illustration of these ideas .",
    "let us consider here for simplicity only the eight isospin - averaged masses @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath206 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 of the ground - state spin - flavor multiplet , where the baryon label stands for its mass .",
    "for @xmath249 the relevant baryon multiplets contain many additional states , as a glance at figs .",
    "[ spin12 ] , [ spin32 ] verifies , but for sake of phenomenology only these 8 physical baryons need be considered .",
    "one must therefore generate the leading 8 independent operators in the @xmath1 expansion , taking into account all operator reduction rules , in order to obtain a set of mass operators that forms a complete basis ( in the sense of a vector space ) for spanning all possible values of masses .",
    "the operators with attendant @xmath1 factors are @xmath250 the mass hamiltonian operator is simply a linear combination of these operators , each with an arbitrary coefficient .",
    "one may now compute the matrix element of each operator for each baryon , obtaining in this way an expression for each coefficient in terms of baryon masses .",
    "for example , the coefficient of @xmath251 is fixed by the combination @xmath252 our mass hamiltonian has not yet taken into account all the known physics of the ground - state multiplet ; in particular , the masses of the baryons are known to break along the hypercharge ( strangeness ) axis , which corresponds to the explicit flavor = 8 indices appearing in ( [ ops ] ) .",
    "this explicit su(3 ) breaking is known to be relatively small , at the order of @xmath253 0.250.30 , since the relative mass difference between , say , @xmath254 and @xmath255 is roughly this size . every time a flavor = 8 index appears ,",
    "let us include a factor of @xmath256 in the mass hamiltonian .",
    "one would now like to compare the matrix element @xmath257 to the mass combination ( [ mcomb ] ) , but both of these expressions still possess scale independence .",
    "that is , both ( [ mcomb ] ) and the coefficients of the mass hamiltonian may be multiplied by arbitrary fixed numbers .",
    "one overcomes this ambiguity by comparing to the @xmath92 common mass of the baryons . on the operator side in our example ,",
    "this means that the relevant quantity is @xmath258 , which for @xmath259 and @xmath8 is about 0.69% . on the mass side ,",
    "one organizes a given linear combination of masses into the form lhs = rhs , where all numerical coefficients on either side are positive , and since the combination vanishes in the spin - flavor symmetry limit , the total of the lhs and rhs coefficients are equal .",
    "one then forms the combination ( lhs + rhs)/2 . in our example , this is @xmath260 .\\ ] ] the desired scale - independent combination is then @xmath261(lhs+rhs ) . here",
    ", this is experimentally @xmath262 ; thus the unknown coefficient of the operator @xmath263 has the very natural size 0.53 .",
    "had we ignored the factors of @xmath0 , the coefficient would have been 0.06 , its small size suggesting that some important physical suppression had been ignored .",
    "carrying out this analysis for all 8 masses gives the plot in fig .",
    "[ mass ] ; here one sees graphically that not only the factors @xmath256 but also the factors of @xmath8 are needed to understand satisfactorily the mass spectrum .",
    "the truly interesting feature of this analysis is that large @xmath0 is used to obtain the relevant operator expansion represented by ( [ ops ] ) , but the phenomenological analysis then employs @xmath14 .",
    "one concludes that , at least for this case , the methods of large @xmath0 seem to survive extrapolation all the way to the rather small observed value of @xmath14 .",
    "similar analysis in the quark operator representation has been performed for the magnetic moments@xcite and axial - vector couplings@xcite , where evidence for the predictions of the @xmath1 expansion is found .    however , this is not to say that the @xmath1 expansion is perfect ! an interesting example of a case where the expansion for @xmath14 does not explain everything is that of nonstrange @xmath264 excited baryons@xcite , such as the @xmath265 .",
    "an analysis similar to that described above ( somewhat more complicated due to the additional presence of the orbital angular momentum operator @xmath266 ) shows that a number of the mass hamiltonian coefficients have central fit values that are quite small , albeit with substantial uncertainties .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this is due entirely to large experimental uncertainties in the mass determination of these resonances , or additional dynamics beyond the @xmath1 expansion , or both . on the other hand ,",
    "if any of the coefficients had turned out too large , it would have been an unmitigated failure of large @xmath0 , since in that case the claimed @xmath1 suppressions simply would not be supported by experiment .",
    "large @xmath0 nuclear theory is a subfield still in its infancy , but the few results obtained thus far are encouraging .",
    "interestingly , all of the current results tend to follow from the observation that @xmath238 has @xmath92 matrix elements for the physical baryons , while those of @xmath267 and @xmath268 are @xmath79 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dominance of @xmath238 is used to show that the @xmath1 leading - order central nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is su(4 ) symmetric . to see this ,",
    "consider the collected su(4 ) generators @xmath269 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ collect ] ) .",
    "the leading su(4 ) symmetric operator for the system consisting of nucleons 1 and 2 is @xmath270_1 \\left [ \\lambda^a \\right]_2 , \\ ] ] which contains @xmath271_1 \\left [ g^{ia } \\right]_2 + o(1/n_c^2),\\ ] ] where the @xmath272 corrections come from @xmath273 and @xmath274 terms .",
    "since @xmath238 is a leading - order operator , one concludes that the leading - order interaction is su(4 ) symmetric .",
    "this reasoning is very similar to that of sec .",

    "one very interesting consequence of this result is an explanation for the observed wigner supermultiplet symmetry .",
    "many nuclear interactions seem to obey a symmetry among the states in the multiplet @xmath277 and large @xmath0 provides an explanation@xcite : given the nn lagrangian only up to dimension-6 operators , one has @xmath278 where the wigner symmetry is preserved by the first term and broken by the second .",
    "however , the second breaks su(4 ) and therefore is subleading in @xmath1 .",
    "the leading @xmath1 behavior of the non - central terms is derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the nonrelativistic , elastic nn potential is expressed through the decomposition @xmath279 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ v_0 ^ 1 + v_\\sigma^1 \\ , \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma_1 \\cdot \\sigma_2 $ } + v_{ls}^1 \\ , \\mbox { \\boldmath",

    "the immediate consequence for the nn interaction is that these terms should dominate the phase shifts , and indeed this is the case . as has been long known , the conspicuous features of the nn interaction are a spin - singlet central potential , for which @xmath284 is prominent , and an isotriplet lorentz tensor force , for which @xmath285 and @xmath286 are prominent . in phenomenologically successful one - meson exchange potential models",
    "these features are represented by including large coupling constants for @xmath169 , @xmath287 , and @xmath288 mesons for the central force , and @xmath169 and @xmath289 for the tensor force . however , the salient point is that the relative importance of these terms in the potential derives directly from large @xmath0 counting , regardless of the physical origin of these couplings .",
    "any phenomenologically successful model must obey the same pattern .",
    "phenomenological studies of the @xmath1 expansion comprise an increasingly large volume of literature .",
    "while these notes are designed as lectures rather than a complete review , i would like at least to mention a number of additional interesting problems that have been tackled to date .",
    "* that the @xmath1 expansion and chiral perturbation theory of baryons may be combined was demonstrated by jenkins@xcite .",
    "the feature discussed earlier that mesons appear in nonets rather than octets of su(3 ) flavor ( _ i.e. _ , that the @xmath290 meson should be included in the chiral lagrangian ) is supported by this construction .",
    "one finds in computing loops with baryon lines in this lagrangian ( which requires including towers of intermediate states : see , _",
    "e.g. _ , fig .",
    "[ conscat ] ) that the tree - level counting of powers of @xmath1 is maintained ; that is , loops produce complicated functions of the chiral symmetry breaking parameters only ( such as @xmath291 ) , not @xmath0 . *",
    "the famous heavy quark effective theory@xcite ( hqet ) relates physical amplitudes of hadrons with heavy quarks ( @xmath111 or @xmath292 ) of different spins or flavors based on the idea that a sufficiently heavy quark is like a static color source , the cloud of light quarks and gluons surrounding it barely noticing its particular spin or flavor quantum numbers .",
    "the relation of different amplitudes , in particular form factors , means that an approximate symmetry is at work in hqet ; however , since large @xmath0 induces an approximate symmetry as well ( spin - flavor su(@xmath214 ) ) , one would expect that large @xmath0 and hqet together produce additional constraints .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown by chow@xcite : there are relations between the form factors for the semileptonic decays @xmath293 , @xmath294 , and @xmath295 . * large @xmath0 and hqet can be combined into a larger and highly predictive effective theory , as shown by jenkins@xcite .",
    "the large @xmath0 spin - flavor symmetry in this case is su(@xmath296 ) @xmath188 su(@xmath297 ) .",
    "case was explored in @xcite .",
    "] one obtains from this study a hierarchy of charmed baryon masses , in analogy to that of @xcite , whose masses agree with experimental values . one can then use the charmed masses to predict the yet unmeasured beauty baryon masses to high accuracy . *",
    "the decays of @xmath298 baryons to ground - state baryons through pions@xcite and through photons@xcite have been investigated in the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "these decays will be measured in great numbers at jefferson lab .",
    "this sampling of different directions of research should demonstrate that the field of large @xmath0 phenomenology is quite vital and holds the promise of producing many further interesting , relevant results .",
    "i invite you to add to the sum of this knowledge .",
    "large @xmath0 qcd is an elegant theoretical construct that organizes all qcd feynman diagrams into a countable set of classes based on their topological properties .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion thus obtained is the only known way to turn qcd into a truly perturbative theory at all energies .",
    "predictions of large @xmath0 are obtained by counting the numbers of powers of @xmath0 associated with each diagram ; since this hierarchy persists when infinite numbers of feynman diagrams are summed to give diagrams for hadronic processes , the approach graduates from one of mathematical curiosity to real phenomenological relevance .    for mesons , many phenomenologically observed but poorly understood properties simply follow from the leading - order term of the @xmath1 expansion , while the operator expansion for baryons provides a vehicle for systematic quantitative analysis of masses , couplings , and other physical observables .",
    "this is an active area of current research at the time of this writing .",
    "all of the results presented here , with the exception of the t  hooft model in sec .",
    "[ mes ] , rely solely on the large @xmath0 counting rules .",
    "essentially , the counting rules provide nothing more than an organizing principle for contributions to physical quantities , while the complicated details of the dynamics reside in the coefficients of these operators .    considering the numerous successes of large @xmath0",
    ", it seems altogether possible that the eventual solution of qcd will depend intimately on this remarkable limit .",
    "this is an opinion shared by many of those who perform much more formal field - theoretical work and are endeavoring to compute the dynamical coefficient in from of the leading term in @xmath1  that is , to sum all the planar graphs .",
    "can this be done for real qcd ?",
    "if so , perhaps buried in the result of this important calculation are treasures like the origins of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "many thanks to the organizers and students for making the summer school a success .",

    "the question of what constitutes a `` nonplanar '' gluon for baryons is more tricky for baryons than mesons . consider fig .",
    "[ ladd ] ; in fig .  [ ladd]@xmath109 one sees an ordinary `` ladder '' diagram that for the mesons would be planar , whereas the crossed diagram fig .  [ ladd]@xmath111 would be nonplanar . for baryons",
    ", however , the double - line notation shows that @xmath109 has no closed color loops , whereas @xmath111 has one .",
    "therefore , since both diagrams share the combinatoric factor @xmath299 and four factors of @xmath34 , the two diagrams scale respectively as @xmath96 and @xmath101 ; figure  [ ladd]@xmath111 is therefore a leading - order diagram .",
    "indeed , we leave it as an exercise for the reader to draw the color flow for the two diagrams , in order to be convinced that maintaining the direction of the arrows on the color lines requires the double lines of gluons to be twisted .",
    "since the two diagrams differ by the crossing of a gluon line , one may call @xmath109 `` nonplanar '' and @xmath111 `` planar ''",
    ".    why has this complication occurred ?",
    "the key is that all of the quarks in the baryon have the same direction of color flow . for mesons , quarks and antiquarks ( which have opposite directions of color flow )",
    "always appear in pairs , and therefore adjacent color loops in the double - line notation always have lines pointing in opposite directions .",
    "this is precisely what is needed to produce orientable surfaces ( see footnote  [ orient ] ) and a convenient diagrammatic topological classification of meson diagrams , and what is lacking in the baryon case .",
