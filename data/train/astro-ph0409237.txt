    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory successfully describes many aspects of the formation of large - scale structure in the universe @xcite .",
    "however , mismatches do exist between its predictions and observations , such as the cusp - core controversy , missing satellites @xcite and the angular momentum problem @xcite . in particular",
    ", the cusp - core issue has provoked much debate .",
    "cdm simulations consistently yield density profiles with steeper inner slopes ( power - law exponent between @xmath71 and @xmath71.5 ) than observational studies which have found a range of slopes , including constant density cores in dark matter dominated low surface brightness galaxies @xcite and shallow slopes in clusters with gravitationally lensed arcs @xcite . these results , among others , have initiated discussion about the role baryons play in softening simulated cores @xcite and the observational effects that may mask cusps in low surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent @xmath0-body results demonstrate that , at the current resolution of simulations , the central power - law exponent does not converge to a universal value @xcite .    in numerical simulations ,",
    "a softened gravitational potential is used to prevent the macro - particles ( 10@xmath810@xmath9 ) from experiencing artificially strong two - body interactions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) . the softening length , @xmath2 , is chosen to maximise the resolution while suppressing two - body effects over the simulation running time",
    "in view of the ongoing disagreement regarding the form of @xmath3 , it is important to clarify _ analytically _ , by a code - independent argument , whether the choice of @xmath2 affects the physics of the system and hence @xmath3 . in this paper , we employ the framework of statistical mechanics @xcite , drawing upon recent results on phase transitions in @xmath0-body systems with attractive power - law potentials @xcite .",
    "self - gravitating particles behave qualitatively differently to many other statistical systems because gravity is an unscreened , long - range force .",
    "they are best examined within the microcanonical ensemble , where the energy and number of particles are fixed and phases with negative specific heat are allowed .",
    "we apply the results of the classical theory of self - gravitating , @xmath0-body systems to demonstrate the effects of introducing a short distance cutoff in numerical simulations , in particular the effect on stability .",
    "the study of the thermal stability of self - gravitating systems has a long history .",
    "@xcite showed that spherical systems of point particles in a box with reflecting walls are gravitationally unstable below a critical temperature , collapsing catastrophically to a central point .",
    "@xcite generalised this work to a spherical system of @xmath0 classical hard spheres in contact with a heat bath , showing the gravothermal instability to be a general feature of self - gravitating systems held at a constant temperature .",
    "@xcite , investigating point fermions obeying the pauli exclusion principle , showed that a _ stable _ low temperature phase can exist if the gravitational potential is softened , transforming the gravothermal instability to a phase transition to the low temperature phase . in this paper , we extend these results and use them to reinterpret some of the ambiguous results of numerical simulations of cdm haloes discussed above .",
    "a detailed comparison with preceding analytic work is presented in section [ comparison ] .",
    "section 2 briefly reviews the formalism for treating @xmath0 self - gravitating , collisionless particles statistically . in section 3 , we apply the formalism to compute @xmath3 analytically as a function of @xmath1 , the total energy , and @xmath2 .",
    "the result is a thermodynamic phase diagram that contains both collapsed and extended haloes . in section 4 , we locate published @xmath0-body simulations on the phase diagram and show they are biased towards the collapsed phase .",
    "this phase is unstable for @xmath10 , suggesting that collapsed haloes are an artificial by - product of the softened potential ; there is no immediate reason to expect agreement between simulated and observed profiles unless the gravitational potential is appreciably softened in nature .",
    "we emphasise at the outset that it is not our intention to reproduce realistic cdm haloes with non - zero angular momentum and hierarchical clustering ; rather , we demonstrate in a code - independent manner how the softening used in @xmath0-body simulations may artificially alter the density profiles found .",
    "the properties ( e.g. energy , entropy ) and collective behaviour ( e.g. gravothermal catastrophe ) of a self - gravitating gas of cdm particles in thermodynamic equilibrium take different values when computed in different statistical ensembles because the long - range nature of the gravitational potential renders the system inseparable from its environment @xcite . in this paper , we follow previous studies by considering the self - gravitating gas in the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) , whose features are constant energy , volume and particle number .",
    "particles do not evaporate from the system over time and the walls of the container are perfectly reflecting .",
    "the mce is more appropriate than the canonical ensemble ( ce ) for three reasons : ( i ) it is unclear how to construct an external heat bath ( required by the ce ) for a long - range potential , because the system interferes with the environment @xcite ; ( ii ) states with negative specific heat are inaccessible in the ce @xcite ; and ( iii ) the equilibrium density profile in the violently relaxed ( smoluchowski ) limit is the singular isothermal sphere in the ce , contrary to observations @xcite .",
    "the density of states , @xmath11 , is the volume of the ( 6@xmath121)-dimensional surface of constant energy @xmath1 in phase space ( @xmath13 ) , where ( @xmath14 ) are the co - ordinates and momenta of the @xmath15-th particle . at any one moment ,",
    "the system occupies one point in the 6@xmath0-dimensional phase space . for particles of equal mass @xmath16",
    ", one has    @xmath17d^{3n}pd^{3n}x,\\ ] ]    where the first and second sums give the kinetic and potential energy , and the integral is over phase space volume .",
    "the gravitational potential , @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 or , if the potential is artificially softened over a characteristic length @xmath20 , by @xmath21^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the thermodynamic entropy @xmath22 ( up to a constant ) and the temperature @xmath23 of the system are defined in terms of @xmath11 :    @xmath24    @xmath25    these quantities are hard to interpret when assigned to a system far from equilibrium .",
    "note that @xmath11 diverges for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; any two particles can be brought arbitrarily close together , liberating an infinite amount of potential energy , so that the co - ordinate space integral diverges @xcite .",
    "this is a serious problem because it is impossible to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium if @xmath11 diverges ; the system does not have time to sample the infinite number of possible microstates with equal probability @xcite . if the dark matter particles are fermions , the pauli exclusion principle does prevent this problem .",
    "however , the fraction of the phase space volume sampled by @xmath0 mildly relativistic cdm particles in a time @xmath28 , given by @xmath29 , is exceedingly small for most proposed cdm particles , e.g. @xmath30m@xmath31/gev for self - interacting dark matter @xcite .",

    "the solutions to these equations describe the density profile , entropy and temperature of an equilibrium system for a given energy . to obtain analogous equations for the softened potential , we replace @xmath45 everywhere with @xmath46^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this extension is valid in the mean - field formalism for @xmath2 small : correction terms are @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the mean - field limit is only meaningful physically for @xmath48 , otherwise @xmath11 diverges .",
    "@xcite verified the mean - field results against monte - carlo simulations and an alternative analytic method known as the mayer cluster expansion , where the density of states is expanded as a combinatorial series in the dilute limit ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the different approaches are in accord in the dilute limit . in order to verify the mean - field approach in the high - density limit ( @xmath50 ) , relevant to the extended and collapsed phases studied here , we need to calculate the correction terms in this limit , following @xcite",
    " a project outside the scope of this paper . nevertheless , to give a rough idea of these corrections , we note ( by analogy ) that they are of order @xmath51 in the ce , where @xmath52 in the ce is a proxy for @xmath53 in the mce .",
    "note that the classical thermodynamic limit ( @xmath54 constant as @xmath55 ) does not apply for gravitating systems ; thermodynamic quantities are finite if proportional to @xmath56 as @xmath55 .",
    "we solve ( [ coupled])([coupled3 ] ) for the radial density profile @xmath32 by the following iterative relaxation scheme @xcite : given the current iterate of the profile , @xmath57 , apply ( [ coupled3 ] ) , ( [ coupled2 ] ) and ( [ coupled ] ) to compute @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 in that order , then apply @xmath61 until the convergence criterion    @xmath62    is satisfied .",
    "we typically adopt @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) in this work .",
    "the softening can be introduced into this scheme in two ways : ( i ) as a nonzero lower limit of integration in the integrals in ( [ coupled])([coupled3 ] ) ; and ( ii ) in the potential , @xmath66^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "both approaches were tested and found to produce qualitatively similar behaviour ; we concentrate on the latter in this work as it is more closely allied to @xmath0-body simulations .      with no softening present in the gravitational potential , a stable solution of ( [ coupled])([coupled3 ] ) formally exists above a cutoff energy @xmath67 .",
    "the density profile of the halo exhibits a flat central core , with @xmath68 as @xmath69 , and near - isothermal wings , with @xmath32 @xmath70 @xmath71 ( @xmath722.2 ) as @xmath73 , as illustrated in figure [ nice_density](a ) .",
    "we refer to it as the _ extended _ phase .",
    "it agrees with the solution for secondary infall onto a spherical perturbation @xcite and behaves asymptotically like the spherical , thermally conducting polytrope @xcite and infinite - dimensional brownian gas @xcite .    for @xmath74 and @xmath10 , a formal solution of ( [ coupled])([coupled3 ] ) does not exist",
    ". the entropy and temperature are discontinuous at this cutoff energy as shown in figure [ nice_density](b ) .",
    "this is the well - known gravothermal catastrophe @xcite .",
    "note that , for @xmath75 , the singular isothermal sphere @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 is always a solution of ( [ coupled])([coupled3 ] ) , as can be verified analytically , but it is not stable and so the iterative procedure never converges to it , but rather to figure [ nice_density](a ) .",
    "if the gravitational potential is softened , a stable phase exists for all values of @xmath80 . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the halo is extended as in figure [ nice_density](a ) , with a flat core and near - isothermal envelope , @xmath82 . however , for @xmath74 , the halo is collapsed .",
    "figure [ collapse_density](a ) displays the density profile of such a collapsed halo for @xmath83 ( note that both axes are logarithmic ) .",
    "the halo has a steep dirac peak ( ` cusp ' ) at @xmath84 : @xmath32 is flat for @xmath85 , decreases as a large inverse power of @xmath86 for @xmath87 and flattens for @xmath88 . for intermediate energies in the range @xmath89 ,",
    "the system is bistable : the halo can be either extended or collapsed depending on the initial conditions and the route to equilibrium .",
    "figure [ collapse_density](b ) , a plot of entropy and temperature as a function of energy , illustrates this bistability and the hysteresis to which it can lead .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 jump discontinuously at both @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath80 enters the intermediate range from below , the halo remains collapsed until @xmath80 exceeds @xmath92 .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath80 enters from above , the halo remains extended until @xmath80 is reduced below @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the critical energy @xmath93 , and the collapsed and extended profiles we obtain , are consistent with previous analyses @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite find a phase transition at @xmath94 , consistent with our value @xmath95 , and a critical reciprocal temperature at the transition in the range @xmath96 for @xmath97 , consistent with @xmath98 in this paper ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "a more precise comparison is prohibited by the adoption of the ce rather than the mce in most previous work .",
    "the van der waals model proposed by @xcite is an exception ; it is examined in detail in the following section .",
    "the phenomenon of bistability was overlooked until the work of @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the system depends somewhat on the choice of the relaxation parameter @xmath99 , defined at the start of this section .",
    "phase_table ] displays the minimum softening length for which the system makes the transition to a stable collapsed phase , for a given value of @xmath99 .",
    "the phase transition from the extended to the collapsed phase is increasingly delicate as @xmath2 decreases : for larger values of @xmath99 , the system is less likely to reach the critical point where the phase transition occurs and thus remains in the extended phase . although the effect is numerical , it potentially reflects the relative likelihoods of the possible routes that the real system can take to equilibrium .",

    "@xmath102 exists in a stable , collapsed phase .",

    "we find that many published simulations inadvertently sample the collapsed phase only , even though this phase is unstable for pure gravity and arguably irrelevant astrophysically .",
    "we remind the reader that we neglect several effects that are important in real cdm haloes , such as hierarchical clustering , nonzero angular momentum , and cosmological expansion .",
