    "the team ( transmission electron aberration - corrected microscope ) project  @xcite has developed the most powerful electron microscope to date , with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution , @xmath4  50  pm  @xcite in both tem ( transmission electron microscopy ) and scanning tem ( stem ) .",
    "this was accomplished through advances in electron optics , particularly aberration correction , and the team project included the development of new kinds of specimen stages and detectors .",
    "one of the goals of the team project is to be able to observe the dynamics of processes at the atomic scale  @xcite , which requires advances over conventional tem detectors .",
    "these include film , image plates and phosphors fiber - coupled to ccds .",
    "each of these techniques has fundamental limitations for high - speed in - situ imaging .",
    "film and image plates directly detect electrons with high spatial granularity but require relatively long exposures and are obviously not high - speed .",
    "phosphors fiber - coupled to ccds have a modest time granularity but are limited in their point spread function ( psf ) and detection quantum efficiency ( dqe ) due to the physics limitations of the steps needed to convert the primary electrons into charge on the ccd cell .",
    "a high - speed detector able to directly detect electrons appears an ideal solution for tem imaging .",
    "the key requirements for team are a minimum of 1k  @xmath0  1k pixels , in order to obtain a field of view of @xmath4  200  angstrom with a magnified pixel size of @xmath4  3  pixels/0.5  angstrom ( provided the psf is @xmath61  pixel ) and a readout time of @xmath6  10  ms , providing 100 or more frames / s .",
    "as team is designed for material science applications , suitable radiation hardness is essential . considering the standard way of operation of experiments in tem , a radiation tolerance of @xmath7  1",
    "mrad would enable its use for approximately one year , which appears to be a valid requirement",
    ".    there has been significant interest in the application of both cmos  @xcite and hybrid  @xcite pixel sensors for direct imaging in tem , to replace conventional ccds optically - coupled to phosphor plates  @xcite . in two recent papers  @xcite in this journal",
    "we discussed the design of a cmos sensor prototype with a radiation - hard pixel cell and characterised its response in terms of energy deposition and line spread function .",
    "we found that by proper design of the pixel cell the sensor can be made enough radiation tolerant to operate properly up to several mrad of ionising dose and the line spread function for 10  @xmath1 m pixel varies from 12  @xmath1 m to 8  @xmath1 m for electrons in the energy range 80  kev @xmath8 300  kev of interest in tem .",
    "these results motivated the development of a larger size pixel chip to perform tests of fast imaging at team .",
    "the final team detector contains 2k @xmath0 2k pixels with 100 frames / s readout . as an intermediate stage ,",
    "1k @xmath0 1k detectors were fabricated . in this paper",
    "we present the design of the team1k pixel chip and discuss the results of its characterisation on a team project test column .",
    "the team1k and team2k detectors are fabricated in a 0.35  @xmath1 m cmos process . for the team1k , four 1  @xmath0  1  cm@xmath2 chips are placed within the 2  @xmath0  2  cm@xmath2 reticle area and for the team2k the entire reticle is used .",
    "all chips employ an identical 9.5  @xmath0  9.5  @xmath1m@xmath2 pixel . in the team1k reticle ,",
    "two of the chips have a 1,024@xmath01,024 pixel imaging area ( `` imaging '' version ) , and the other two chips have the same imaging area , except that a central 500  @xmath1 m circular area is replaced with a simple diode ( `` diffraction '' version ) . one `` imaging '' and one `` diffraction '' chip are designed with analog and digital sections very similar to the design previously reported , as backup designs .",
    "the other two `` imaging '' and `` diffraction '' chips have several improvements over previous designs , and these new versions are the ones discussed in this paper .",
    "the team1k chips are organised as 16 identical slices each with 1,024 rows and 64 columns .",
    "each slice has a novel analog output buffer , capable of driving a capacitive load of up to 20  pf .",
    "in addition , each slice has a variable bottom - of - column current load , which can `` look ahead '' a programmable number of columns . in a conventional active pixel sensors ( aps ) , there is a fixed current bias at the bottom of the column . in order to reduce power , as the sensor has to be operated in vacuum ,",
    "the standing current in this bias should be small . for speed , though , this current needs to be large enough for the signal to slew within the time needed to digitise a pixel . in this implementation ,",
    "a larger bias current is switched on when the given column is selected ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 clock cycles before ( @xmath12 ) and then maintained for the next clock cycle when the column is selected . sending the output to digitising electronics outside of the microscope vacuum requires an amplifier capable of providing high currents as needed to drive the capacitive load .",
    "again , with the desire to minimise power , the output stage consists of two parts : a conventional low - power operational amplifier , along with a higher - power slew rate enhancer ( sre ) .",
    "the small - signal amplifier has the necessary gain , bandwidth , and noise performance to settle to the required precision , while the sre minimises the fraction of the sample period that is spent slewing a large voltage step .",
    "the sre is activated when the error voltage at the small - signal amplifier input exceeds a designed value .",
    "since charge generation is confined primarily to the thin epitaxial layer , just @xmath4  14  @xmath1 m thick , it is possible to remove most of the underlying detector bulk silicon using a back - thinning process . the charge collection , noise and charge - to - voltage calibration",
    "have been studied by characterising a batch of cmos pixel sensors before and after back - thinning and no significant effects have been observed  @xcite .",
    "back - thinning is performed by aptek industries  @xcite using a proprietary technique .",
    "the process has been extensively tested and yields in excess of 90  % have been obtained for thicknesses down to 50  @xmath1 m  @xcite .",
    "team1k detectors are thinned to 50  @xmath1 m .",
    "the use of thin sensors minimises the charge spread due to back - scattering in the bulk , thus maximising the contrast ratio in tem imaging .",
    "the energy deposition in the sensor active layer and the lateral charge spread are simulated with the geant4 program  @xcite , using the low - energy electromagnetic physics models  @xcite .",
    "the cmos pixel sensor is modelled according to the detailed geometric structure of oxide , metal interconnect and silicon layers , as specified by the foundry .",
    "electrons are incident perpendicular to the detector plane and tracked through the sensor . for each interaction within the epitaxial layer ,",
    "the energy released and the position are recorded .",
    "charge collection is simulated with pixelsim , a dedicated digitisation module  @xcite , developed in the marlin c++ reconstruction framework  @xcite as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the simulation has a single free parameter , the diffusion constant @xmath13 , used to determine the width of the charge carrier cloud .",
    "its value is extracted from data by a @xmath14 fit to the pixel multiplicity in the clusters obtained for 300  kev electrons .",
    "we find @xmath13 = ( 14.5@xmath15 )  @xmath1 m , which is compatible with both the value obtained for 1.5  gev @xmath16s with a prototype having 20@xmath020  @xmath1m@xmath2 pixels produced in the same cmos process  @xcite and that inferred from the diffusion length ( estimated from the doping in the epitaxial layer ) and the measured charge collection time  @xcite .",
    "the sensor response to ionising radiation is studied with 5.9  kev x - rays and electrons of energy ranging from 80  kev to 300  kev .",
    "the microscope tests are carried out in the fei titan test column at the national center for electron microscopy ( ncem ) .",
    "the prototype chip is mounted on a proximity board which is held on the film insertion plate of the microscope .",
    "the insertion plate is built on a removable mechanical assembly which allows easy and quick replacement of the sensor .",
    "the plate can be inserted in and retracted from the column by means of a pneumatic actuator .",
    "the temperature is monitored during operation by measuring the resistance of a temperature - sensitive resistor included in the chip . in absence of active cooling",
    ", the thick sensor operates at a temperature of @xmath4  90  @xmath17c , while the thin sensor between 40 and 50  @xmath17c , depending on running conditions .",
    "data are taken for 6.25 and 25  mhz clock frequency and different beam intensities . for response characterisation",
    ", four contiguous sectors of the chip are tested at the same time , the four analog outputs being read out in parallel .",
    "two flex cables , exiting from the column through a vacuum feed - through , provide the interconnection with the data acquisition and monitoring electronics located outside the microscope .",
    "an intermediate board provides the chip with the biases and driving clocks , performs signal amplification and deploys differential stages for adapting the analog output signals to the data acquisition ( daq ) system .      for this study",
    "a custom daq system  @xcite is used .",
    "data from four of the chip analog outputs are digitised by four 100  ms / s , 14-bit adcs on a custom - designed board interconnected with a commercial development board  @xcite , implementing a xilinx virtex-5 fpga device , 64  mb of on - board ddram memory and communication devices .",
    "clock pattern generation and chip control is performed via high - speed lvds lines by the virtex-5 , which also controls and synchronises the acquisition with the adcs reference clock .",
    "the daq system is connected to a control pc via a usb  2.0 bus , for acquisition control and daq steering through dedicated registers and for data retrieval .",
    "the bandwidth for data transfer is @xmath5  40 mbytes / s .",
    "a graphical user interface based on a series of dedicated c / c++ classes interfaced to the root  @xcite framework classes provides an intuitive and easy - to - use system for acquisition monitoring , fast data display and on - line processing  @xcite .",
    "raw data is stored in root format , and further converted in the lcio  @xcite format for offline analysis .",
    "this is performed with a set of dedicated processors , developed in the marlin reconstruction framework .",
    "the sensor noise and uniformity among the different analog outputs are measured in the lab in dark . the pedestal level for each pixel",
    "is computed from the average pulse height over 100 consecutive acquisitions .",
    "a pixel - to - pixel dispersion of less than 8  mv is obtained .",
    "the pedestal dispersion varies within 2% among the different analog outputs of the same sensor .",
    "an average pixel leakage current below 10  fa is inferred from the results of measurements performed at different clock frequencies ranging from 25  mhz down to 6.25  mhz , corresponding to integration times of 2.6  ms and 10.5  ms , respectively .",
    "the sensor charge - to - voltage conversion gain is measured from the response to 5.9  kev x - rays from a @xmath18fe source , corresponding to a charge generation of 1640 electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : iron_spectrum ] shows the spectrum obtained on one analog output for a clock frequency of 6.25  mhz , at room temperature .",
    "a calibration of 14.9  e@xmath19/adc  count is obtained .",
    "the gain of the different analog outputs of the same sensor is found to vary within 3% .",
    "the charge - to - voltage conversion gain is expected to depend on the voltage applied to the pixel diode junction . for small signals , as those induced by one or few electrons , the capacitance of the junction can be considered constant and the conversion linear . for larger signals obtained when many electrons hit the same pixel in a single frame the capacitance of the diode junctions",
    "is expected to increase by several percent , up to @xmath5  20% for signals corresponding to the full sensor dynamic range .",
    "since most of the analyses reported in this paper deal with relatively small signals , up to few tens of electrons or less , we assume a constant calibration factor in the analysis . typical average pixel noise figures of ( 32@xmath32 )  e@xmath19 and ( 28@xmath32 )  e@xmath19 of equivalent noise charge ( enc ) are measured under operating condition in the microscope set - up for clock frequencies of 25 and 6.25  mhz , respectively .",
    "the response to single electrons is characterised in terms of energy deposition and cluster size .",
    "we study the energy deposition in the sensor pixels , varying the number of electrons recorded per pixel and per frame .",
    "first , we operate with a flux of @xmath4  50  @xmath16  mm@xmath20  frame@xmath21 , which allows us to resolve individual electrons . under these conditions ,",
    "electron hits are reconstructed as pixel clusters .",
    "for these events the sensor response is characterised in terms of the number of pixels associated to a cluster and the pulse height measured in a 5@xmath05 pixel matrix centred around a seed pixel .",
    "the response measured on data is compared to the geant4+pixelsim simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : landau ] shows the reconstructed energy deposited by 300  kev electrons for data and simulation . a good agreement is observed .",
    "the uniformity across a detector sector has been studied for bright field illumination at a flux corresponding to an energy deposition of @xmath4200  kev pixel@xmath21 frame@xmath21 .",
    "the distribution of the energy recorded in each pixel in a single frame is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : landau ] .",
    "the dispersion of signal on the pixels fully exposed to the electron beam is obtained by a gaussian fit to the recorded energy distribution . the relative r.m.s .",
    "dispersion at 300 , 200 , 120 and 80  kev is 0.063 , 0.058 , 0.080 and 0.11 , respectively .",
    "the increase at lower energies is interpreted as an effect of the larger energy loss fluctuations , since measurements are performed at constant energy per pixel instead of constant number of electrons per pixel .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : noise ]    table  [ tab : noise ] summarises the pixel charge - to - voltage gain calibration and noise as a function of the dose , for a pixel clock frequency of 25  mhz .",
    "the gain calibration is estimated from the position of the most probable value of the landau distribution for single electrons measured at low flux after each irradiation step .",
    "a slight decrease of the pixel gain is observed with the increasing dose , while the noise increases by about 25% .",
    "the single electron cluster pulse height is not significantly affected after irradiation ( see figure  [ fig : ph_irradiation ] ) and the average cluster signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) measured for single 300  kev electron detection changes from 12.3 before irradiation to 10.9 after 5  mrad of dose .",
    "finally , we check the imaging properties of the detector by determining the lsf after irradiation .",
    "we repeat the fit to the measured pulse height on pixel rows across an image of the stretched gold wire . by performing a single sigmoid fit , as discussed in section  5.1",
    ", we obtain a lsf value of ( 7.2@xmath30.6 )  @xmath1 m at 300  kev , which is consistent with the value of ( 7.4@xmath30.6 )  @xmath1 m obtained before irradiation .",
    "a direct detection detector which meets the requirements for team has been developed and characterised using 80  kev to 300  kev energy electrons .",
    "we measure a line spread function of ( 12.1@xmath30.7 )  @xmath1 m to ( 7.4@xmath30.6 )  @xmath1 m for 80 @xmath22 300  kev with bright field illumination and ( 6.7@xmath30.3 )  @xmath1 m to ( 2.4@xmath30.2 )  @xmath1 m with cluster imaging and a dqe = 0.78@xmath30.04 and 0.74@xmath30.03 at the two ends of the energy range explored .",
    "the imaging performances of the detector are identical after irradiation with 300  kev electrons up to a dose of 5  mrad , while the dynamic range is reduced by @xmath4  30  % due to leakage current increase . the good agreement obtained in pixel response and line spread function between measurements and simulation",
    "demonstrate that the tools to understand the detailed performance of the detector are in hand .",
    "r&d on new detectors with enhanced performances is currently under way .",
