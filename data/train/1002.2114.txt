    "[ [ ams - subject - classification - msc2010 ] ] ams subject classification ( msc2010 )        the use of computer - based tests in which questions are randomly generated in some way provides a means whereby a large number of different tests can be generated ; many universities currently use such tests as part of the student assessment process . in this paper",
    "we present findings that illustrate that , although the number of different possible tests is high and grows very rapidly as the number of alternatives for each question increases , the average number of tests that need to be generated before all possible questions have appeared at least once is surprisingly low .",
    "we presented preliminary findings along these lines in @xcite .",
    "a computer - based test consists of @xmath0 questions , each ( independently ) selected at random from a separate bank of @xmath1 alternatives .",
    "let @xmath2 be the number of tests one needs to generate in order to see all the @xmath3 questions in the @xmath0 question banks at least once .",
    "we are interested in how , for fixed @xmath1 , the random variable @xmath2 grows with the number of questions @xmath0 in the test .",
    "typically , @xmath1 might be 10i.e",
    ".  each question might have a bank of 10 alternatives  but we shall allow any value of @xmath1 , and give numerical results for @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as for @xmath6 .      in the case",
    "@xmath7 , i.e.  a one - question test , we re - notate @xmath2 as @xmath8 , and observe that we have an equivalent to the classic coupon - collector problem : your favourite cereal has a coupon in each packet , and there are @xmath1 alternative types of coupon .",
    "@xmath8 is the number of packets you have to buy in order to get at least one coupon of each of the @xmath1 types .",
    "the coupon - collector problem has been much studied ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we can write @xmath8 as @xmath9 where each @xmath10 is the number of cereal packets you must buy in order to acquire a new type of coupon , when you already have @xmath11 types in your collection .",
    "thus @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the number of further packets you find you need to gain a second type , and so on .",
    "the random variables @xmath14 ,  , @xmath15 are mutually independent . for the distribution of @xmath16 , clearly @xmath17 we say that @xmath18 , or @xmath19 has a geometric distribution with parameter @xmath20 , if @xmath21 for @xmath22 , 2 ,  .",
    "thus @xmath23 . as the @xmath24 distribution has expectation @xmath25 it follows that @xmath26 for different values of @xmath1 we therefore have the following .",
    "the amount of variability can be better appreciated through the standard deviation .",
    "the asymptotic bounds on the standard deviation of @xmath2 are @xmath27 and some values for these are in table [ ta : sd ] .",
    "the lower bound is non - trivial , i.e.  positive , in each case .",
    "we are grateful to dave pidcock , a colleague in the mathematics education centre at loughborough university , for raising the query in the first place . as a member of staff using computer - based tests to assess students , he was concerned about this issue from a practical viewpoint . that led rc to post a query on allstat .",
    "cmg was not the only person to respond to the query , and we also acknowledge the others who responded , particularly simon bond .",
