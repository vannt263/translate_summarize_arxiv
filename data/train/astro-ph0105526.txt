    "the amount and distribution of atomic carbon is important for understanding of the physical and chemical structure , formation precesses , and thermal balance of interstellar molecular clouds . since the ionization potential of neutral atomic carbon ( 11.266 ev ) is close to the dissociation energy of co ( 11.09 ev ) , it ( c@xmath5 ) is thought to be confined in a thin layer near the surfaces of molecular clouds .",

    "the situation is well illustrated in fig.6 which shows a plot of integrated intensities along a line passing through the [ ci ] peak and dr15a .",
    "a hump at dr15 in the [ ci ] intensity is the southern extension of the [ ci ] lump (  3.1 ) , and it could correspond to the emission from thin photodissociated layer near surfaces of uv - irradiated clouds .    the variation of the density could account for the observed arrangement .",
    "the lower density produces a lower temperature photo - dissociated layer , which has low rates of oh production and , consequently , increases c@xmath5 by shutting off the co formation route through oh ( e.g. , hollenbach , takahashi , &  tielens 1991 ) .",

    "according to hollenbach , takahashi , &  tielens ( 1991 ) , a plane - parallel pdr with @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath46 has a c@xmath5 column density of @xmath111 @xmath101 .",

    "indeed , @xmath15 may be higher than 500 at the position close to dr15a , the discrepancy between theory and observation would be more significant .",
    "the hypothesis of unresolved , high density clumps , does not change the situation , since it decreases the ci column density of each clumps while it increases the surfaces to be consistent with the observed @xmath2co intensity .",
    "we therefore conclude that the steady - state pdr models are not able to give reasonable interpretations to the observed co 32(hii)/co / ci arrangement and the deficit of c@xmath5 toward dr15 .",
    "the similarity in the distributions of the [ ci ] and @xmath2co lines may be an indication that these lines arise from the same spatial regions .",
    "this implies that c@xmath5 basically coexist with molecular gas , except for the dense regions in molecular clouds , such as molecular cores g79.37 + 0.33 and g79.27 + 0.38 .",
    "this idea is supported by the results of our large - scale ci surveys of nearby molecular clouds ( e.g. , ikeda et al .",
    "1999 ) . to account for the coexistence of c@xmath5 and co , some revisions to the steady - state pdr models or",

    "1996 ; strzer , stutzki , &  sternberg 1997 ; suzuki et al .",

    "the dynamical timescale of a dense core with @xmath112 @xmath46 is @xmath113 years , while its chemical timescale ( timescale for conversion from c@xmath5 to co ) is @xmath114 years .",
    "thus , the carbon in a high - density core is incorporated into co completely before the core collapse . in the less dense region with @xmath115 @xmath46 , the dynamical timescale and the chemical timescale become comparable [ @xmath116 years ] , and hence c@xmath5 can coexist with co for a while even after uv radiation is shielded .",
    "the ci - rich cloud found in heiles cloud 2 ( maezawa et al . 1999 ) may be the typical of such a chemically young molecular cloud .",
    "it is likely that high - density cores , g79.37 + 0.33 and g79.27 + 0.38 , are chemically evolved , while less dense envelope is chemically young .",
    "another idea is based on the chemical models with bistable solutions .",
    "these models predict that there exist two phases in the chemical equilibrium state at low densities ( @xmath117 @xmath46 ; pineau des forts , roueff , &  flower 1992 ) .",
    "the two stable solutions referred to as the high ionization phase ( hip ) and the low ionization phase ( lip ) lead into two different c@xmath5/co ratios in clouds with identical density and temperature .",
    "this means that the gas - phase abundance of c@xmath5 can be large ( c@xmath5/co=0.10.2 ) in hip , even in the absence of a uv field . for the cloud cores , where the density exceeds the critical value for bistability ,",
    "the system necessarily take a solution with a low c@xmath5/co ratio ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the chemical bistability can be applicable to the dr15 case , if we consider the [ ci ] peak as hip and the cores of g79.37 + 0.33 and g79.27 + 0.38 as lip .",
    "the bistability model can also account for the ubiquitous value of the c@xmath5/co ratio ( 0.10.2 ) over the bulk of molecular clouds , although its applicability is still controversial .",
    "we have studied the distributions of the ci @xmath0@xmath1 line , the co _",
    "j_=32 line , as well as of the _ j_=10 transition of @xmath2co and c@xmath3o toward dr15 , an hii region associated with two irdcs .",
    "neutral atomic carbon is extended over the molecular clouds traced by the @xmath2co _",
    "j_=10 line .",
    "the two dense molecular cores with masses of @xmath40 m@xmath4 and @xmath41 m@xmath4 , which correspond to the irdcs , have been found in the @xmath2co and c@xmath3o data .",
    "the [ ci ] integrated intensity peaks farther into the molecular cloud from the ionization front behind the irdcs .",
    "the column density ratio @xmath88 toward the [ ci ] peak is 0.15 , which is similar to those observed in giant molecular clouds and nearby dark clouds , while the dense cores ( irdcs ) exhibit very low ratios ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "j_=32 emission strongly peaks at the dr15 fir 1 , exhibiting a poor spatial correlation with the [ ci ] distribution .",
    "j_=32(hii)/co / ci arrangement and the deficit of c@xmath5 toward dr15 are inconsistent with the prediction of pdr models , and suggest an origin for interstellar atomic carbon unrelated to photodissociation .",
    "models with time - dependent chemistry or chemical bistability could account for the observed h@xmath95/co / c@xmath5 arrangement and the c@xmath5/co ratios as well .",
    "we are grateful to the nro staff for excellent support in the 45 m observations .",
