    "a widely accepted model for producing gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is based on the dissipation of a relativistic outflow ( e.g. piran 2004 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) .",

    "after a short acceleration phase , the motion becomes highly relativistic , and a narrow shell is formed .",
    "after the fireball shell uses up all its internal energy , it coasts with a lorentz factor of @xmath9 and the radial width @xmath10 .",
    "the deceleration process of the shell is described with two shocks : a forward shock propagating into the ism and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "the forward shock is always ultra relativistic , while the evolution of the reverse shock is determined by a dimensionless parameter @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sedov length and @xmath13 is the proton mass . if @xmath14 ( so called thick shell case ) , the reverse shock becomes relativistic in the frame of the unshocked shell material and it drastically decelerates the shell .",

    "the profile of the shocked ism medium begins to approach the blandford & mckee ( 1977 ) solution .",

    "the deceleration of a shell happens at an observer time @xmath22 where @xmath23 and all the correction factors in this paper , including @xmath24 , are defined as ones relative to the conventional thin shell estimates . at the deceleration time , the forward and reverse shock regions have almost the same lorentz factor and internal energy density .",
    "however , the reverse shock region has a much larger mass density and therefore it has a lower temperature . introducing a magnetization parameter @xmath25 , it is shown that the typical frequencies @xmath26 and peak fluxes @xmath27 of the synchrotron emissions from the two shocks are related as ( kobayashi & zhang 2003 ; zhang et al .",

    "this simple estimate is good enough for the magnetization estimate .",
    "for no or moderate primordial magnetic fields in a fireball , at the forward shock is very low ( e.g. @xmath38 ; kumar & barniol duran 2009 ) , we expect the typical frequency of the reverse shock emission is much lower than that of the forward shock emission @xmath39 . for typical events ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) ,",

    "there are four possible relations between the break frequencies and the optical band at the peak time @xmath49 : ( a ) @xmath50 , ( b ) @xmath51 , ( c ) @xmath52 , and ( d ) @xmath53 . in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) , the forward shock emission peaks at @xmath54 when the typical frequency @xmath55 goes through the optical band ( the top panel in figure [ fig : twopeaks ] ) . using @xmath56",
    ", we get the peak time and peak flux ratio @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are optical peaks in the time domain , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 are peaks in the spectral domain for a given time .",
    "the hydrodynamics evolution of a reverse shocked shell is investigated in kobayashi & sari ( 2000 ) , and the decay index @xmath62 of the reverse shock emission is found to be almost independent of @xmath63 when @xmath64 . combining equations ( [ eq : relation ] ) , ( [ eq : rt ] ) and",

    "the estimate ( [ eq : rb ] ) is valid . on the other hand , if it is still in the fast cooling regime when @xmath66 crosses the optical band , the forward shock emission rises and decays very slowly as @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( sari et al .",
    "since this behavior is not consistent with most early afterglows , we do not discuss the details . for the magnetization estimate where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the random lorentz factors of electrons corresponding to the typical and cooling break frequencies , respectively .",

    "it is possible to show that equation ( [ eq : rb ] ) is still valid .",
    "when an early afterglow light curve shows a flattening at @xmath72 after the steep decay phase ( the bottom panel in figure [ fig : twopeaks ] ) , the reverse shock emission dominates at early times .",
    "the forward shock peak is masked by the reverse shock emission , the peak ( @xmath54 , @xmath59 ) is not observationally determined .",
    "in such a case , the upper limit @xmath73 gives a rough estimate of @xmath36 .",
    "considering that the reverse and forward shock emission components are comparable at the flattening , we obtain @xmath74 . substituting this relation into equation ( [ eq : rb ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "if the forward shock emission peaks earlier @xmath77 , the real value of @xmath36 might be slightly different . to evaluate how @xmath36 depends on @xmath54 , we refer to the scalings @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the decay index of the forward shock emission . using these scalings",
    ", one finds that the dependence is weak : @xmath81 .",
    "if the forward shock decays as the theory suggests @xmath82 , a relation 1+@xmath83 holds , and @xmath36 does not depend on @xmath54 ( gomboc et al .",

    "the ratio @xmath84 between the poynting flux energy and the kinetic energy ( the baryonic component ) around @xmath49 is expressed as a function of the magnetization parameter @xmath36 as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the lorentz factor of shocked shell material relative to the unshocked shell .",
    "the simple estimates of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which we have discussed in section [ sec : fsrs ] , provide useful insights into the fireball dynamics .",
    "however , these are order - of - magnitude estimates , and obtained by assuming that the reverse shock is ultra - relativistic or newtonian . since most observed bursts are actually in the intermediate regime @xmath87 , we here consider a better approximation which is similar to one discussed by nakar & piran ( 2004 ) .",

    "however , in the thin shell regime @xmath105 , due to the shell s spreading @xmath106 , the value @xmath107 is always about unity at @xmath16 ( sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "then , if we plot @xmath102 and the reverse shock temperature @xmath108 as functions of the initial value @xmath63 , they are expected to flatten in the intermediate regime . since @xmath109 in the thick shell and intermediate regime , we can directly compare the two approximations , and we find that the conventional approximation overestimates @xmath102 and @xmath108 in the intermediate regime .",

    "the two analytic estimates which we have discussed include approximations ( e.g. a simplified shock approximation and no gradients in the distribution functions of hydrodynamics quantities in the shock regions ) .",
    "furthermore , the estimate ( [ eq : intermediate ] ) gives the lorentz factor @xmath17 for a given @xmath103 at the deceleration radius @xmath16 , instead of the initial value @xmath63 .",
    "since the typical frequency of the reverse shock emission is sensitive to the temperature @xmath108 , it is important to investigate how @xmath103 at @xmath16 depends on @xmath63 ( or where @xmath103 becomes a constant ) and what asymptotic value the reverse shock temperature takes in the thin shell regime . to examine the accuracy of the approximations and evaluate the shock lorentz factors and the corrections factors @xmath24 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , we employ a spherical lagrangian code based on the godunov method with an exact riemann solver ( kobayashi et al .",

    "if internal shocks are responsible for the production of the prompt gamma - rays , the dispersion should be even larger ( beloborodov 2000 ; kobayashi & sari 2001 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion leads to the spreading of the shell structure in the coasting phase and the @xmath103 parameter decreases as @xmath289 . as an order - of - magnitude estimate ,",

    "if the fireball is not magnetized @xmath119 , the reverse shock emission more easily falls below the forward shock emission . the lack of optical flashes from most grbs might be partially explained in a revised non - magnetized model .",
