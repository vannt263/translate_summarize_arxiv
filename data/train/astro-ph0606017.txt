    "we should notice here that even if @xmath179 occurs by the discharge of created pairs in most portions of the gap , the negative @xmath180 inevitably exerts a strong positive @xmath26 at the surface ( see h06 for details ) , thereby extracting ions from the surface for the solution with super - gj current . on these grounds",
    ", we can regard this modern outer - gap solution as a mixture of the traditional inner - gap model , which extracts electrons from the surface with @xmath181 , and the traditional outer - gap model , which exerts positive @xmath26 because of the negativity of @xmath165 .",

    "because of this assumption , @xmath26 is suppress at a very small value , which reduces pair creation significantly . to justify this @xmath189 distribution",
    ", they proposed that @xmath85 should grow by the _ cross field motion _ of charges due to toroidal forces  @xcite , and that @xmath188 is a small constant so that @xmath190 may not exceed the flux of the emitted charges from the star , which ensures the _ equipotentiality _ of the slot - gap boundaries .",
    "because of the very thin gap , @xmath191 , the cross - field motion becomes , indeed , important .",
    "however , the assumption that @xmath188 is a small positive constant may be too strong , because it is only a sufficient condition of equipotentiality .",

    "in short , whether the gap solution becomes mh04a way ( with a negative @xmath26 as an outward extension of the inner - gap model ) or h06 way ( with a positive @xmath26 as an inward extension of the outer - gap model ) entirely depends on the transfield thickness and on the resultant @xmath188 variation along the field lines .",
    "if @xmath194 holds in the outer magnetosphere , @xmath188 could be a small positive constant by the cross - field motion of charges ( without pair creation ) ; in this case , the current is slightly sub - gj with electron emission from the neutron star surface , as mh04a , b suggested . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath195 holds in the outer magnetosphere , @xmath188 takes a small negative value by the discharge of the created pairs ( fig .",
