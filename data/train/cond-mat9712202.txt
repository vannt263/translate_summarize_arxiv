    "this work is a continuation of our preceeding paper @xcite , which is devoted to the ground state properties of alternating heisenberg spin chains .",
    "there we investigated 1@xmath0 systems described by hamiltonians ( model a ) @xmath1 or ( model b ) @xmath2 two kinds of lattice sites , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , alternate within the chain . in both models ,",
    "sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 are occupied by nearest @xmath7-spins ( @xmath8 ) , which can be interpreted as forming a dumbbell configuration perpendicular to the chain direction .",
    "@xmath4 denotes their common in - chain coordinate . in model",
    "a , @xmath3 coordinates contain single @xmath9-spins , whereas in model b the @xmath3-sites are also occupied by dumbbells of @xmath9-spins with coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 . a simple interpretation of model b is an alternating chain of orthogonal dumbbells . in this work",
    "we concentrate on model a. however , the methods used below can be reformulated for model b as well .",
    "two spins , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are incorporated into the _ compound spin _ @xmath14 , which is either 0 , or 1 .",
    "this reveals a hidden ising symmetry of the original heisenberg model ( [ ham_a ] ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath15 exchange term in ( [ ham_a ] ) does not generate transitions between the total spin states 0 and 1 of any compound spin .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham_a ] ) can be rewritten in a more suitable form as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xmath18 counts the self - energy of a compound spin .",
    "we can use the following evident strategy : any configuration of spins is characterized by intrinsic `` defects '' , i.e.  @xmath4-sites , where the compound spin is zero .",
    "these `` defects '' , which are controlled by the @xmath19-terms , decompose the original chain into an ensemble of finite chain fragments , which are decoupled from each other .",
    "their structure can be defined as follows : a fragment of length @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is an alternating chain of @xmath22 spin-@xmath9 sites and @xmath20 spin-1 sites .",
    "chain fragments are isolated from each other by a zero spin .",
    "it is convenient to measure all energies in units of @xmath15 , the latter is supposed to be negative .",
    "thus we set @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "we have observed successive first order transitions governed by @xmath19 at zero temperature . for model",
    "a with @xmath24 , it is a sequence @xmath25 , where a periodicity element @xmath26 can be represented as @xmath27 .",
    "e.g. , @xmath28 is the periodical alternating structure , where all @xmath4-sites are occupied by zero spins . for spins",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 the phase transition sequence becomes @xmath31 .",
    "the first two transitions , taking place at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are well isolated from each other , and from @xmath34 .",
    "the latter appears to be very close to the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "a proper method to find out and classify all these transitions is based on linear programming theory . for our particular problem",
    "it prescribes to compare the reduced energies @xmath37 of isolated chain fragments @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath38 is the ground state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath39 ( see ( [ ham_1 ] ) ) with open boundary conditions .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following decomposition of @xmath38 : @xmath40 in ( [ ener_fit ] ) @xmath41 is the energy per element ( @xmath42 ) of the perfectly periodic spin structure , @xmath43 is the energy due to the open ends , and the remaining part , @xmath44 , can be interpreted as the interaction between the chain fragment ends , which goes to zero at @xmath45 .",
    "thus , _ a succession of phase transitions is given by a broken line , which is concave upwards and envelops @xmath44 from below _ @xcite .",
    "two typical functions @xmath44 are shown in figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "in the former , @xmath44 is a monotonic function , and thus the system passes through all intermediate phases from @xmath28 to @xmath46 , when @xmath19 increases from large negative values . in figure 1b",
    ", the enveloping function corresponds to a restricted number of transitions , which is typical for mixed heisenberg chains @xcite , but with increasing values of @xmath9 the minimum becomes very shallow .",
    "note that if hamiltonian @xmath39 takes the form of an ising hamiltonian , then @xmath47 . in a spin - wave approximation for @xmath48",
    ", this function belongs to the type shown in figure 1a .",
    "certainly , at non - zero temperature all phase transitions are smeared out .",
    "but thermodynamic quantities may exhibit a crucial dependence on temperature in vicinities of the critical @xmath19 values .",
    "we start the next section with an example which will teach us some peculiarities of the thermodynamics of these systems .",
    "besides analytic methods we have used numerical complete diagonalization of finite chain fragments . by utilizing global @xmath49 conservation",
    "we have been able to obtain all energy eigenvalues of the chain fragments with @xmath50 .",
    "the computations have been performed on an _ ultra enterprise 10000 _ computer manufactured by _ sun",
    "microsystems_. this is a parallel computer with 40 cpus and 20 gbytes of shared memory .",
    "all programs have been implemented in c++ .",
    "let us consider the vicinity of the @xmath51 transition . for @xmath24 and zero temperature",
    "the system undergoes the phase transition at @xmath52 . at this value",
    "the ground state is manyfold degenerate : chain fragments of unit length , @xmath53 , are embedded into the @xmath28 phase .",
    "this means that the distributions of `` defects '' ( zero spins at @xmath4-sites ) is subject to the following constraint : _ two `` non - defect '' sites ( spin-1 ) can not be nearest neighbours on the @xmath4-sites .",
    "they must be separated by at least one `` defect '' . _",
    "the partition function at zero temperature is the total number of all valid configurations .",
    "let us assume that @xmath54 counts all the configurations , which are realized between the sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 , but the sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 are fixed at zero spin .",
    "for @xmath3 , half - integers are reserved . ] .",
    "this yields a recurrence relation for the partition function @xmath57 : @xmath58 the two terms on the r.h.s . of ( [ z1 ] )",
    "correspond to the two possibilities for @xmath59 to be either a `` defect '' or a `` non - defect '' site .",
    "if it is a `` defect '' site ( first term ) , we count all configurations between the `` defect '' sites , @xmath55 and @xmath59 .",
    "the factor 2 is due to the additional spin-1/2 at site @xmath60 .",
    "this spin is enclosed by `` defects '' , so it is _ free _ or paramagnetic .",
    "the second term on the r.h.s . of ( [ z1 ] ) corresponds to the case , where @xmath61 is a `` non - defect '' site .",
    "since `` non - defects '' are not allowed to be nearest neighbours , @xmath62 must contain a `` defect '' .",
    "thus the configuration count of the remaining part is @xmath63 .",
    "evidently , the boundary conditions for ( [ z1 ] ) must be chosen as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "now we define an additional quantity @xmath66 , which counts the number of `` non - defects '' between the spin - singlets on sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 , summed over all allowed configurations .",
    "it satisfies the equation @xmath67 the first two terms on the r.h.s .  of ( [ d1 ] )",
    "are similar to those on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) .",
    "the third term counts how many times the `` non - defect '' at @xmath61 appears in all valid configurations . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "let us discuss , how eqs .",
    "( [ z1])-([d1 ] ) have to be modified in case of non - zero temperatures .",
    "if all terms in @xmath54 are preceded by their statistical weights , we can use this quantity to calculate the partition function of a chain of length @xmath71 with open boundary conditions . instead of the set @xmath72 ( cf .",
    "( [ ener_fit ] ) ) , one should make use of the set of free energies @xmath73 . since we consider the vicinity of the @xmath51 transition ( i.e.  @xmath74 ) , only @xmath75 and @xmath76 enter the calculation .",
    "all other configurations are suppressed at low temperatures ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "introducing boltzmann factors @xmath78 , and setting @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we arrive at the following modification of eqs .",
    "( [ z1])-([d1 ] ) : @xmath81 @xmath82 the solution of ( [ z2 ] ) is @xmath83 for solving ( [ d2 ] ) , we try the ansatz @xmath84 for the concentration of spin-1 sites in long chains we obtain @xmath85 the relationship between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which enter the leading terms of @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 , can be directly derived from eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) : @xmath91    the physical quantities , such as the specific heat and the entropy , can straightforwardly be calculated as derivatives of the free energy . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath92 , the free energy per compound spin is simply @xmath93 if @xmath94 is favorable ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath96 we arrive at the expression @xmath97    the magnetic susceptibility reflects the groundstate investigations of our former paper .",
    "in fact , as far as chain fragments of length @xmath53 are in the spin - singlet state , only `` isolated '' spin-@xmath98 sites , associated with @xmath99 , contribute a curie - like susceptibility .",
    "it can be expressed as a contribution of individual `` isolated '' spins , @xmath100 , multiplied by their concentration @xmath101 this exhibits `` half - a - gap '' behavior , @xmath102 , when @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "this , and the analogous @xmath104-dependence of the specific heat can be interpreted in terms of an equilibrium chemical reaction , in which any spin singlet ( 1/2 , 1 , 1/2 ) may transform into _ two _ paramagnetic spins 1/2 and a `` defect '' .    in the vicinity of the @xmath51 transition , the results of this section are not only valid for @xmath24 , but also for other spins on the @xmath3-sites .",
    "evident changes are :    1 .",
    "@xmath105 , and @xmath19 varying around @xmath106 .",
    "2 .   @xmath107 , resulting in @xmath108 and @xmath109 3 .",
    "a group of spins ( @xmath110 ) , whose total spin value at low temperatures is practically @xmath111 , is paramagnetic too , as well as an `` isolated '' spin @xmath9 .",
    "the curie - like susceptibility is straightforwardly calculated as @xmath112",
    "for @xmath113 , quantum fluctuations are efficient enough to `` isolate '' the @xmath114 transition from @xmath115 . in ref .",
    "@xcite these zero - temperature transitions were estimated as @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "thus , at low temperatures we can investigate the regions around @xmath118 and @xmath32 separately .",
    "in section  ii the subject of interest is the competition of `` defect '' and `` non - defect '' sites , provided two `` non - defects '' can not be nearest neighbours , if @xmath19 is around @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , two `` defects '' can not be nearest neighbours in the second critical range around @xmath118 at low temperatures .",
    "instead of dealing with `` defect '' and `` non - defect '' objects , let us use the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite . for convenience ,",
    "chain fragments have been defined as follows : a chain fragment of length @xmath20 formally includes a spin-0 site from its right , so it can be represented as ( 1/2,1)@xmath119(1/2,0 ) .",
    "conventionally , the nearest spin from the left of any chain fragment is also 0 , but this spin is incorporated into the fragment which lies on the l.h.s .",
    "of this site . in this classification ,",
    "a chain fragment of zero length is ( 1/2,0 ) .",
    "now we can reformulate one of the statements mentioned above . in the second `` critical '' range around @xmath118 zero - length chain fragments",
    "are incompetitive and may be neglected at low temperatures .",
    "however , we shall see from the specific heat calculation that at intermediate temperatures , e.g. @xmath120 , and intermediate @xmath19 between @xmath32 and @xmath118 , not only chain fragments of unit length dictate thermodynamic properties , but longer chain fragments and zero - length fragments also contribute essentially .",
    "therefore we have to take into account chain fragments of any length , and no special restrictions on the values of @xmath19 and temperature will be imposed .",
    "the free energy of a chain fragment of length @xmath20 can be written as a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ ener_fit ] ) : @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are temperature - dependent . in this section ,",
    "the configurational part of the free energy will be determined by making use of recursive relations similar to ( [ z2])-([d2 ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to take the global configuration @xmath124 as the `` vacuum '' state .",
    "a zero spin within this background is called a `` hole '' .",
    "if we ignore the interaction term in ( [ fr_ener_fit ] ) , i.e.  @xmath125 , then any `` hole '' costs the free energy @xmath126 .",
    "in fact , the free energy of a very long chain , @xmath127 , becomes @xmath128 if a `` hole '' is inserted . for two `` holes '' we obtain @xmath129 , and so on .",
    "however , this consideration is no more valid if two `` holes '' occupy nearest neighbour sites on the @xmath4-sublattice .",
    "such two `` holes '' give rise to a zero length chain fragment . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath130 , which can be subdivided into @xmath128 and @xmath131 .",
    "the latter should be interpreted as the free energy of the zero length chain fragment . only the `` holes '' which are separated by a chain fragment of non - zero length and which do not have other `` holes '' between them , interact via @xmath132 , where @xmath21 is the chain fragment length , or the number of spin-1 sites between these _ nearest _ holes .",
    "we denote the statistical weight of a chain fragment of length @xmath20 by @xmath133 . then starting with @xmath134\\quad { \\rm and}\\ ] ] @xmath135,\\ ] ]",
    "we obtain @xmath136 , \\quad k\\!\\geq\\!1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for longer chain fragments .",
    "recurrence relations for the partition function are evident generalizations of ( [ z2 ] ) : @xmath137 each @xmath138 counts all possible spin configurations with corresponding statistical weights between @xmath139 and @xmath140 , while fixing the boundary compound spins at @xmath139 and @xmath140 at zero .",
    "the prefactor 2 of @xmath141 on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ z3 ] ) is due to the spin-1/2 at site @xmath142 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the set of partition functions are @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the latter reflects the existence of a free spin-1/2 between two spin-0 sites .",
    "the lower index in @xmath145 has the same meaning as in @xmath138 , whereas the upper index is related to the chain fragment length .",
    "@xmath145 measures how often chain fragments of length @xmath146 occur between the sites @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "of course , any spin configuration in @xmath145 picks up a corresponding statistical weight .",
    "the recurrence relations for shortest chain fragments , @xmath147 and 1 , have a structure which is similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ z3 ] ) : @xmath148 @xmath149 the first terms on the r.h.s .  of ( [ d3_0 ] ) and ( [ d3_1 ] )",
    "are the contributions of the spin-0 and spin-1 sites at @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "the boundary condition , which should be imposed on @xmath151 , reads @xmath152 . for @xmath153 , we can set @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "generalization of the recurrence relations and boundary conditions to arbitrary chain fragment lengths @xmath146 is also evident : @xmath156    we define the concentration @xmath157 of chain fragments of length @xmath146 as the ratio of the expectation value of their total number @xmath158 to the total number of @xmath4-sites , @xmath71 : @xmath159 similar to equation ( [ conc ] ) .",
    "these concentrations must satisfy the conservation law @xmath160 which states that the total number of compound spins , zeros and ones , is equal to the total number of @xmath4-sublattice sites .",
    "the set of equations ( [ z3])-([d4 ] ) allows us to perform a straightforward numerical analysis .",
    "however , let us try an analytical approach by assuming that @xmath161 for all @xmath21 .",
    "practically , this means that @xmath162 which is well satisfied at @xmath163 , as we shall see in section iv . in this approximation",

    ", one can conclude that the knowledge of all @xmath169 allows us to calculate any expression of higher rank , e.g. @xmath183    at lower temperatures it is necessary to bring in more boltzmann factors .",
    "the simplest extension of the temperature range @xmath184 does not impose restrictions on @xmath185 any more , the latter is not necessarily much smaller than the temperature .",
    "this leads us to the introduction of three boltzmann factors , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 $ ] , if @xmath189 ( see definition ( [ boltz ] ) ) .",
    "numerical results of the next section will show that such a description is a good approximation for @xmath190 .",
    "this is a systematic way to extend our approach to lower temperatures . by using four boltzmann factors ,",
    "the system can be described down to @xmath191 .    in appendix",
    "a we outline how the method developed above works in the general situation , where temperature is restricted from below : @xmath192 . in this case",
    "we deal with a set of statistical weights @xmath193",
    "by using complete matrix diagonalization we have computed all energy eigenvalues of finite chain fragments up to @xmath194 . from these eigenvalues ,",
    "the exact values of the free energy for various temperatures have been calculated .",
    "we decompose the free energy into an affine contribution @xmath195 and an `` interaction '' contribution @xmath196 .",
    "this decomposition is defined by @xmath197    @xmath198    table [ tab_free ] shows computed values of @xmath196 for @xmath199 , @xmath120 , and @xmath200 .",
    "free energy values for @xmath201 and @xmath194 have been used to determine @xmath202 and @xmath203 , so @xmath204 for all temperatures .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation can be estimated from figures [ fig_freelow ] , [ fig_freehigh ] , and [ fig_freeinter ] , where @xmath196 decays quickly and smoothly to zero .    for low temperatures ( @xmath205 ) ,",
    "the @xmath20-dependence of the free energy is qualitatively similar to the ground state energy .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig_freelow ] .",
    "as in the ground state energy , there is a clear minimum at @xmath53 , which corresponds to the phase transition sequence @xmath206 at @xmath207 .    for @xmath208 ,",
    "temperature has smeared out the ground state structure completely .",
    "deviations from the affine contribution @xmath195 decay exponentially fast as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig_freehigh ] for @xmath209 and @xmath200 .    in the crossover region @xmath210",
    "we observe an interesting phenomenon : as shown in figure [ fig_freeinter ] , the minimum of the free energy has moved from @xmath53 to @xmath211 .",
    "this is due to the spin - degeneracy of the chain fragment .",
    "the total spin of a chain fragment of length @xmath20 is @xmath212 for low temperatures , so the degeneracy is @xmath213 .",
    "this yields @xmath214 as an additional contribution to the free energy .",
    "if we subtract this additional contribution from @xmath215 , the minimum at @xmath53 is restored .",
    "this contribution is _ only _ relevant at intermediate temperatures : at low temperatures it is suppressed by the prefactor @xmath216 , at high temperatures the @xmath217 contribution to the spin entropy is no more dominant .",
    "indeed , the magnetic behaviour of short chain fragments can not be described by a single paramagnetic spin @xmath218 . in other words , at high temperatures the spin ",
    "spin correlation length becomes smaller than @xmath20 .      by including small magnetic fields into the hamiltonian ,",
    "we have computed the zero - field susceptibility for @xmath219 and various temperatures .",
    "there are two contributions to the magnetic susceptibility :    1 .   the paramagnetic contribution , which is @xmath220 for low temperatures .",
    "2 .   the contribution @xmath221 due to the antiferromagnetic correlations inside the chain fragment .",
    "though the exact form of this contribution is unknown , it is expected to be approximately linear in @xmath20 and only slowly varying as a function of temperature .",
    "figure [ fig_chivstr ] shows the magnetic susceptibility as a function of inverse temperature for fragment lengths @xmath222 .",
    "the numerically computed values ( various symbols ) are almost perfectly connected by the exactly known paramagnetic contribution ( [ chip_def ] ) ( lines ) , where @xmath223 has been inserted for @xmath218 .",
    "please note that there are no fit parameters .",
    "therefore , at least for low temperatures , the susceptibility is well described by the curie law ( [ chip_def ] ) . for higher temperatures",
    "@xmath224 is not strictly linear in @xmath225 .",
    "additionally , with increasing temperature the antiferromagnetic contribution @xmath221 decays slower than @xmath224 , so @xmath221 may become relevant for larger @xmath216 .    of course , the coincidence of @xmath226 with @xmath224 for low temperatures can also be observed when plotting @xmath226 as a function of the fragment length @xmath20 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig_chivskl ] for temperatures @xmath227 .    for high temperatures ,",
    "the correlation length becomes smaller than the fragment length . in this case",
    ", the effective total spin can be interpreted as being composed of several independent blocks of individual spins .",
    "the typical length of these blocks is the correlation length @xmath228 , so the effective total spin square @xmath229 is proportional to @xmath230 , in contrast to the low temperature situation , where @xmath212 .",
    "this results in a _ linear _ @xmath226 vs @xmath20 dependence , which is numerically confirmed , as shown in figure [ fig_chivskh ] .",
    "there we have successfully fitted affine functions @xmath231 to the computed data points .",
    "if we would extend figure [ fig_chivskl ] to large values of @xmath20 , we would certainly observe a crossover from parabolic to linear @xmath20-dependence at sufficiently large fragment length @xmath20 .",
    "the crossover region depends on temperature .",
    "we finish this section by considering intermediate temperatures , where the crossover behaviour can be observed at finite fragment length @xmath232 .",
    "figure [ fig_chivski ] shows this intermediate temperature region .",
    "the crossover from quadratic to linear behaviour is governed by a logarithmic correction @xmath233 which fits @xmath234 successfully for temperatures around @xmath120 .",
    "this behaviour presumably is reminiscent of the crossover in the free energy , which takes place at the same temperature range .",
    "this part of the paper is some kind of a synthesis of the analytic approach developed in section iii and numerical computations performed in section iv .",
    "we shall illustrate this by computing the specific heat for two temperatures , low and intermediate , @xmath199 and @xmath120 , and for reasons , which will be explained below , the magnetic susceptibility versus @xmath19 will be calculated for intermediate temperatures @xmath235 and @xmath120 .",
    "please note that in section ii we derived an analytical expression for the magnetic susceptibility , which holds in the vicinity of the @xmath236 transition , where all contributions of chain fragments of length @xmath237 can be neglected , i.e.  at low enough temperatures .",
    "the specific heat per compound spin is calculated as @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the total free energy of the alternating chain . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the partition function is given by the logarithm of the maximum root @xmath240 of the polynomial ( [ eigenvalue ] ) .",
    "the `` reference state '' in the derivation of the partition function is the perfect @xmath241-structure , so the complete free energy is given by @xmath242 according to table",

    "as expected , the most interesting features can be found in the regions around @xmath32 and @xmath118 . in order to understand the double - peak structure , which is shown in the insert ,",
    "consider the expression @xmath247 for the total free energy of the alternating chain .",
    "as indicated , both the concentrations @xmath248 and the free energies @xmath249 of the finite fragments depend on temperature , so the specific heat involves @xmath248 itself and its first and second derivatives . at low temperatures , @xmath248 is a step - like function , which qualitatively explains the splittings of the peaks and their shapes .    at @xmath120 , temperature has smeared out the fine structure around @xmath32 and @xmath118 .",
    "both regions are not isolated from each other , nevertheless the double - peak structure is still visible in figure [ fig_fullchigh ] .",
    "figures [ fig_fullclow ] and [ fig_fullchigh ] illustrate the dependence of the specific heat on the interior coupling constant @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath256 are known numerically from subsection  a. for @xmath257 the largest eigenvalue @xmath258 , so because of ( [ bm_more_k ] ) we can safely cut - off the summation ( [ full_chi_sum ] ) after @xmath201 . as @xmath19 approaches @xmath118 , all concentrations @xmath248 for finite @xmath20 quickly decay to zero , as @xmath241 becomes the dominating configuration .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath259 of this configuration is unknown for @xmath199 , but we can extrapolate it easily for those temperatures at which @xmath226 versus @xmath20 is in the linear regime . from the calculations performed in subsection b ,",

    "it is necessary to emphasize , that the unusual thermodynamic behaviour described in this paper can be efficiently observed in those compounds , where the values of the coupling constants @xmath266 and @xmath267 lead to competitive interactions . then a major contribution to thermodynamic quantities comes from thermal changes of the fragment concentrations @xmath248 .    1 .   to make the basic ideas transparent , we employ a simple representation of these chains : `` compound spins '' and spin-1/2 sites alternate within the chain .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig_fullclow ] , these peaks are split at low temperatures . the origin of this fine structure is the step - like behaviour of the fragment concentrations @xmath248 , predominantly @xmath280 and @xmath281 . with increasing temperature , the peaks become broader and overlap , but the local minima still point out the vicinities of the critical @xmath19 values , cf .",

    "all these pretransitional phenomena , which can be identified clearly , are provided by the configurational contributions to thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we have developed an analytic approach for calculating the free energy and the concentrations of chain fragments of different lengths .",
    "this is achieved by solving polynomial equations , whose degree increases at lower temperature .",
    "in fact , the hierarchical structure of the equations is regulated by @xmath125 , i.e.  the part of the free energy of a chain fragment of length @xmath20 which can be interpreted as the interaction of fragment ends . from numerical computations we observed that @xmath123 decays rapidly with @xmath20 .",
    "5 .   for other alternating chains , where the non - compound sites are occupied by higher spins",

    "the last one is @xmath283 if @xmath48 . for these chains ,",
    "the occurence of several peaks in the specific heat would be possible .",
    "however , very low temperatures are needed to isolate some peaks : although the successive transitions @xmath51 and @xmath284 are sufficiently separated , the distance between @xmath285 and @xmath283 is only @xmath286 .",
    "6 .   to investigate the thermodynamics of alternating chains with @xmath287 ,",
    "other methods could be used instead of exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "a modification of the spin - wave approximation , which can be adjusted to our problem , has been proposed by m. takahashi @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , the quantum transfer matrix of exactly solvable spin chains has been investigated in order to calculate thermodynamic quantities .",
    "a combination of this approach and numerical methods could be applied to our problem .",
    "generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward : for instance in two dimensions , the `` white '' squares of a checkerboard lattice contain single spins , while the `` black '' ones are occupied by compound spins .",
    "competition may again reveal a hidden ising - like variable and possible two - dimensional superstructures .",
    "of course , similar models can be constructed on any bipartite lattice .",
