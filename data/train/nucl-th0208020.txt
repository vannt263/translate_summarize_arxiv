    "it is generally believed that there exist several phases in nuclear matter . among the phase transitions between these phases ,",
    "the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition has been extensively studied in these three decades  @xcite .",
    "it takes place in relatively cold ( @xmath4 = ( 5 - 8 ) mev ) and less dense ( @xmath5 ) nuclear matter , and it causes multifragmentation in heavy - ion collisions . when the expanding nuclear matter cools down and goes across the boundary of coexisting region , it becomes unstable against small fluctuations of density or @xmath6 asymmetry , then various fragments are abundantly formed almost simultaneously . especially at around the critical point",
    ", fragment distribution is expected to follow the power law  @xcite , @xmath7 , which is one of the characteristic features of critical phenomena .",
    "recent theoretical model studies  @xcite have shown that it is very difficult to describe this fragment distribution in a picture of sequential binary decays of one big compound nucleus , which has been successfully applied to the decay of nuclei at low excitation .",
    "this finding suggests that it is necessary to consider _ statistical ensemble of various fragment configurations _ rather than one dominant configuration in describing fragment formation at around the boundary of coexisting region .    in the universe ,",
    "the temperature and density of this liquid - gas phase transition would be probed during supernova explosion . in the collapse and bounce stages of supernova explosion ,",
    "the density and temperature are high enough to keep statistical equilibrium  @xcite . at baryon densities of @xmath8 ,",
    "since the density is too high for neutrinos to escape , neutrinos are trapped in dense matter .",
    "this leads to an approximate conservation of lepton fraction @xmath9 and entropy per baryon @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the lepton and baryon number , respectively .",
    "after the core bounce , supernova matter , which is composed of nucleons and leptons , expands and cools down . as the baryon density and the temperature decrease , charged particle reactions become insufficient and the chemical equilibrium ceases to hold , namely the system freezes out at this point .",
    "if the supernova matter goes across the boundary of coexisting region and the boiling point @xmath4 of the liquid - gas phase transition is higher than the freeze - out temperature @xmath13 , this matter will dissolve into fragments and form various nuclei in a critical manner .",
    "it further keeps equilibrium and expands to the freeze - out point .",
    "the statistical distribution of fragments at freeze - out would provide the initial condition for following nucleosynthesis such as the r - process .",
    "( see following references on r - process  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the importance of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition in supernova explosion was already noticed and extensively studied before  @xcite . however , there are two more points which we should consider further .",
    "first , the main interest in the previous works was limited to the modification of the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the nuclear distribution as an initial condition for the r - process was not studied well .",
    "secondly , in constructing the eos of supernova matter , the mean field treatment was applied in which one assumed one kind of large nucleus surrounded by nucleon and alpha gas  @xcite . at temperature much above or below the boiling point ,",
    "fragment mass distribution is narrow and the one species approximation works well .",
    "however , since fluctuation dominates at around the boiling point , it is necessary to take account of fragment mass and isotope distribution .",
    "this distribution of fragments can modify the following r - process nucleosynthesis provided that the freeze - out point is not far from the boiling point .",
    "in this work , we study nuclear fragment formation through the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition during supernova explosion .",
    "this process may lead to the production of medium mass nuclei as seed elements and serve as a pre - process of the r - process .",
    "we call this process as lg process  @xcite . in order to pursue this possibility quantitatively ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the liquid - gas coexisting region .",
    "we find that the liquid - gas coexisting region extends down to very low density keeping the boiling point around @xmath14 mev in a two - phase coexistence treatment of eos with the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model  @xcite . in supernova explosion",
    ", it can happen that material with @xmath15 is ejected to outside  @xcite .",
    "adiabatic paths of ejecta are found to go through the calculated liquid - gas coexisting region even with high entropy .",
    "having this finding of the passage through the coexisting region , we investigate the fragment distribution at around the boiling point in a statistical models of fragments  @xcite , referred to as the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) in astrophysics .",
    "we show that heavy elements around the first , second , and third peaks of r - process are abundantly formed at @xmath16 and @xmath3 , respectively , with temperatures around and just below @xmath4 in nse .",
    "furthermore , the isotope distribution of these elements are also well described in this model .",
    "we find that it is important to take account of the coulomb energy reduction from the screening by electrons in supernova matter .",
    "although nuclei formed at high densities @xmath17 having very small entropy at around @xmath4 is not likely ejected to outside , heavy elements up to the r - process third peak are already formed statistically at these densities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the treatment of two - phase coexistence with rmf model in sec .",
    "the liquid - gas coexistence is shown in the ( @xmath18 ) diagram .",
    "we demonstrate that it would be possible for a part of ejecta in supernova explosion to experience the liquid - gas coexisting region .",
    "the effects of liquid - gas coexistence on eos , proton fraction , and adiabatic path are also studied . in sec . 3",
    ", we describe the nuclear statistical model of fragments at equilibrium ( nse ) to study the production of elements .",
    "we take into account the coulomb energy modification from electron screening .",
    "we evaluate the fragment distribution at around the boiling point and in the coexisting region within this statistical model .",
    "we found that fragments are formed abundantly even at very low densities if the temperature is around the boiling point .",
    "we compare the calculated mass and isotope distributions of fragments with the solar abundance  @xcite . in sec . 4 , we discuss the possibility of the ejection of nuclei synthesized in the coexisting region referring to a hydrodynamical calculation of supernova explosion  @xcite .",

    "the boiling points of supernova matter remain to be @xmath43 1 mev even at very low densities for all lepton fractions .",
    "the large value of @xmath4 is due to symmetrization of nuclear matter by leptons .",
    "since @xmath26 is kept constant but @xmath44 is not fixed , the supernova matter searches its minimum in free energy by changing @xmath44 . in high density supernova matter",
    ", the lepton fraction is shared by electrons and neutrinos ( @xmath45 ) , then the net neutrino fraction and the lepton chemical potential become positive ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "compared to neutrino - less supernova matter ( @xmath47 ) , this positive @xmath48 in supernova matter helps to enhance @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , and to symmetrize nuclear matter . at very low baryon densities ,",

    "[ fig : eos ] .",
    "this is consistent with the above consideration on the lepton dominance . on the other hand , the asymmetry parameter start to decrease at much higher density in coexisting matter",
    "this symmetrization is mainly due to the symmetry energy in nuclear matter .",
    "since the baryon density in the liquid part of matter is around @xmath52 , nucleons can gain symmetry energy by reducing the asymmetry .",

    ", the pressure behaves as in the case of maxwell construction for volume instability ; pressures in the coexisting region are lower ( higher ) at low ( high ) densities than in uniform matter during the coexistence .",
    "on the other hand , we can find double phase transition behavior in lepton deficient matter ( @xmath68 ) ; while the pressure behaves as in the case of volume instability at higher densities ( @xmath69 , there is another overtaking in the density region of @xmath70 . at these densities ,",
    "the matter becomes unstable to the small fluctuations of proton fraction , and liquid part of the matter becomes rapidly symmetric as the density decreases .",
    "thus the overtaking of the pressure in the low - density region may be suggesting the phase transition in the isospin degrees of freedom .",

    ", we can clearly see nuclear and coexistence effects .",
    "while adiabatic paths in uniform matter ( dashed lines ) evolve very smoothly , those with two - phase coexistence ( thin solid lines ) bend closer to the boundary of coexisting region .",
    "this can be seen even at @xmath74 .",
    "this bending comes from the latent heat and suggests that significant amount of nuclei are formed around the boundary .",
    "observations in the previous section tell us that it would be possible for supernova matter to experience the liquid - gas phase transition before it is ejected to outside .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the composition of ejecta experienced the phase coexistence .",
    "however , we have assumed that the coexisting two phases are infinite .",
    "it is also to be noted that nuclear matter in the liquid phase is more symmetric than in the gas phase . as a result",
    ", the coulomb energy is expected to be large , which we have neglected in the previous section , and the infinite matter in the liquid phase will fragment into finite nuclei . although the effects of these nuclear formation on eos may not be very large  @xcite , fragment distribution at freeze - out would serve as the initial condition for the following r - process . therefore ,",
    "in this section , we evaluate the fragment yield in a fragment - based statistical model .      in order to describe distribution of finite nuclei ,",
    "we utilize a fragment - based statistical model .",
    "this kind of statistical models have been widely used in heavy - ion collision studies  @xcite as well as in astrophysics , as referred to the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse )  @xcite . in nse , we solve the statistical equilibrium condition among nucleons , fragments and leptons in fragment - based grand canonical ensemble . in this work ,",
    "we have ignored relativistic corrections and anti - particle contributions of fragments , and fragments are assumed to follow the boltzmann statistics , while leptons are treated relativistically .",

    "the nuclear binding energy @xmath78 plays an essential role .",
    "fragment yields are sensitive to the binding energy modification due to , for example , the medium effects in supernova matter . in studies of heavy - ion collisions , since the density and its fluctuation are large , the repulsive interfragment coulomb potentials are taken into account explicitly rather than in the form of mass modification . in supernova matter under consideration , attractive electron - fragment coulomb potential effects are more important .",
    "since electron density is not negligible and almost constant , we ignore inter - fragment coulomb potentials and the electron effects on intrinsic fragment coulomb energies are incorporated in the form of binding energy modification .",
    "we have used the wigner - seitz approximation in evaluating the coulomb energy correction  @xcite to the binding energy of nuclei adopted in nse .",
    "we assume that the electrons are distributed uniformly in a sphere with radius @xmath88 which is determined to cancel the charge of the fragment @xmath80 at a given electron density @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 where @xmath91 is the nuclear binding energy in vacuum , and @xmath92 is the nuclear radius .",
    "it is important to note that the coulomb energy correction , @xmath93 , contains the term proportional to @xmath94 . because of this functional form , the correction is meaningfully large even at @xmath95 .",
    "for example , when the electron fraction is @xmath96 , the reduction of the coulomb energy for heavy nuclei amounts to 90 % of the total coulomb energy at @xmath97 , and the reduction is around @xmath98 even at @xmath99 . the increase of binding energy acts to enhance heavy nuclei , and some nuclei beyond the dripline at vacuum or unstable against fission , can be stabilized in supernova matter .",
    "finite gas nucleon density also plays a role to form nuclei beyond the dripline tentatively by the balance of nucleon absorption and emission .",
    "we have adopted the mass table of myers and swiatecki  @xcite , which is based on the thomas - fermi model with shell correction for about 9000 kinds of nuclei .",
    "since nuclear binding energies depend on the electron density , we have to solve the chemical equilibrium condition of nuclei and leptons in supernova matter in a consistent way to satisfy @xmath100 .",
    "provided that the baryon density and temperature are given , and that the charge and lepton densities are fixed as @xmath101 , all the particle densities are determined if the average proton fraction ( @xmath44 ) is given ,    [ eq : yp - rhon ] ( 1 - y_p ) _ b & = & _ f n_f _ f(_n , _ p , b_f(_e ) ) _ n ( _ n ,",

    "if the density is not very small , the freeze - out temperature @xmath13 is expected to be around or just below the boiling point @xmath4 . below the boiling points , fragments are formed abundantly by absorbing many of gas nucleons , and nuclear _ number _ density of particles ( sum of nucleon and fragment densities ) becomes quickly smaller , then the mean free path for each particle becomes much longer .",
    "this rapid fragment formation makes the typical interaction intervals longer , and is expected to help the system to freeze - out .",

    "this power law was suggested by fisher  @xcite  for a mass distribution of droplets at around the critical point .",
    "as the temperature becomes lower than the boiling point , the distribution at each density becomes localized to some mass number .",
    "the localization is caused by the small entropy and shell effects .",

    "[ fig : sna ] , the distribution at @xmath147 shows the same trend .",
    "it is interesting to find that the peak position in the nse results is shifted downwards compared to the observed third peak of r - process .",
    "this shift mainly comes from the @xmath6 ratio of formed nuclei .",
    "the observed third peak of r - process is a consequence of the neutron magic number @xmath148 and the @xmath6 ratio along the r - process path . in the present nse model calculation ,",

    "further careful studies are necessary to examine quantitatively the mass ejection by performing the numerical simulations of hydrodynamics with neutrino - transfer of core - collapse .",
    "although hydrodynamical explosion ( so - called prompt explosion ) has been claimed to be limited for very small iron core and extreme cases of eos and electron capture rates  @xcite , the outcome of nucleosynthesis is extremely interesting if the mass ejection really occurs .",

    "the boiling points become slightly lower , but they are still high ; @xmath172 mev for @xmath1 .",
    "calculated fragment mass distributions around @xmath173 show enhancement of the iron peak elements , the first , second , and third peak r - process elements at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in addition , calculated isotope distribution shows that very neutron rich nuclei around and beyond the neutron dripline may exist under thermal and chemical equilibrium in supernova matter with degenerate neutrinos . these unstable nuclei against neutron emission",
    "would provide a lot of neutrons after freeze - out , which may help the r - process to proceed .    from the present investigations , we can draw a new scenario for making seed nuclei before the r - process ; fragments are abundantly formed through the liquid - gas phase transition of supernova matter before the freeze - out , and this formation of fragments serve to produce the bulk structure of the seed elements .",

    "the entropy at @xmath4 is large enough , and the seed nuclei will be nucleons , @xmath38 , iron peak nuclei and a small amount of the first peak nuclei of r - process .",
    "higher densities may not be relevant to ejection , but it may be closely related to the nuclear distribution on hot neutron star surface .    in this work ,",
    "we have assumed equilibrium throughout this paper .",
    "one of the key questions is the freeze - out conditions of supernova matter , at which nuclear reactions become less frequent and supernova matter goes off equilibrium in the expansion time - scale .",
    "the seed nuclear distribution of the r - process will be given as the nuclear distribution on the freeze - out line in the @xmath174 diagram .",
    "it is important to determine the freeze - out condition in supernova dynamics .",
    "another important direction is to construct a model which includes both of the mean field nature such as in rmf and the statistical nature in nse . in a present nse treatment ,",
    "only the coulomb correction is included as the medium effects , and medium effects from strong interactions are neglected .",
    "this neglection may lead to the overestimate of neutron rich nuclei , as discussed in recent statistical fragmentation models  @xcite . on the other hand , in the thomas - fermi treatment of heavy - nuclei with eos derived using rmf , since statistical nature or fragment distribution",
