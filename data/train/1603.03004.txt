    "optical frequency combs ( ofc ) , generated by femtosecond mode - locked lasers , are recognized to be very powerful devices for spectroscopy .",
    "they offer large bandwidth ( @xmath7 ) discretized at the comb mode frequencies .",
    "they are defined by the repetition rate of the femtosecond oscillator @xmath8 and by a carrier - envelop offset frequency @xmath9 translating the whole comb of a constant value comprised between @xmath10 and @xmath8 , each comb mode frequency being indexed by an integer @xmath11 and defined as @xmath12 .",
    "several approaches @xcite have been designed to combine ofc s with the extended path lengths associated with high finesse cavities , to attain high sensitivity in molecular absorption spectra . some resolve the comb mode structure ( with 1 ghz mode locked laser ) @xcite , some are fast ( around or below the ms timescale of acquisition ) @xcite , some particularly sensitive ( baseline noise around 10@xmath13 ) @xcite , but none truly exploit the full bandwidth of ofc , restricting the accessible spectral range to roughly a few hundred of wavenumbers , around ten percent of the entire range of a typical titanium : sapphir ( ti : sa ) mode - locked laser .",
    "recently , we have developed a new scheme enabling the injection of the full spectrum of an ofc through a high finesse optical cavity and achieving high sensitivity , ghz resolution and sub - second acquisition time @xcite .",
    "it uses vernier filtering , whereby the laser repetition rate and the cavity free spectral range @xmath14 are deliberately mismatched ( as are the two divisions of a vernier caliper ) so that the cavity outputs a new comb whose mode - spacing is sufficiently large that it can be dispersed with optical gratings .",
    "this vernier coupling scheme is currently established as a calibration strategy for the astro - comb extensively developed to calibrate spectra recorded from telescope , creating the so - called astro - comb @xcite .",
    "gohle _ et .",
    "@xcite first applied it to laboratory molecular spectroscopy , resolving the comb mode structure of a 1 @xmath15 ti : sa mode - locked laser over 4 thz ( 130 @xmath0 ) , in 10ms , but at the price of a poor sensitivity ( baseline noise of a few 10@xmath16@xmath0 with an effective optical path - length around 300 m ) . in 2014",
    "@xcite , the same philosophy was extended to a 250 mhz erbium doped fiber mode - locked laser @xcite without the comb mode resolution ( a resolution of 1,1 ghz is obtained ) . a spectral coverage of 160 @xmath0 and a sensitivity of 8@xmath310@xmath4@xmath0 ( with an effective optical path - length of 11 km )",
    "was demonstrated on a time scale of 1 s. still , only a small part of the ofc was exploited and sensitivity performances were again limited by the strong frequency - to - amplitude noise conversion resulting from the un - stabilized cavity with respect to the stabilized ofc .",
    "our approach is distinguished by the degree of mismatches between @xmath14 and @xmath8 . in astro - comb or previous work in molecular spectroscopy ,",
    "the mismatch is large enough to filter out comb teeth adjacent to the tooth transmitted by the cavity .",
    "each tooth of the new comb created at the cavity output thus corresponds to a single tooth of the original optical comb . to extract spectroscopic information from the sample placed inside the cavity ,",
    "the cavity length is slightly swept to permit the transmission of the successive comb teeth through the cavity .",
    "the cavity transmission is thus modulated by the matching condition .",
    "conversely , our scheme uses sufficiently small mismatches that several adjacent teeth are simultaneously ( partially ) transmitted",
    ". the matching condition is always fulfilled , and the cavity length sweep induces a continuous transmission . with a particular cavity locking scheme , this continuous vernier filtering enables to probe the entire range of a free - running 100 mhz repetition rate ti : sa mode - locked laser , at ghz resolution and an optimized sensitivity . with this approach , an absorption baseline noise of 2@xmath310@xmath4@xmath0",
    "is demonstrated with an effective optical path - length of 1,5 km and a spectral coverage larger than 2000 @xmath0 with 31300 independent spectral elements acquired in 1 s. we derive a full analytical model to describe the cavity transmission in presence of intracavity absorbing species for this continuous vernier filtering regime .",
    "we show that both the real and imaginary part of the resonant molecular response need to be take into account revealing a strong dependency of the measured line profile on the sign of the vernier mismatch . using the full model and a non - linear fitting algorithm , we present results of the 3@xmath1+@xmath2 water vapor band adjustment over more than 100@xmath0 including more than 350 lines , and the measured spectra of the hot band of the magnetic dipole intercombination transition in molecular oxygen .",
    "the vernier approach relies on a controlled mismatch between @xmath14 and @xmath8 from the reference position corresponding to the perfect match ( pm ) . in the frequency domain , this pm coupling",
    "occurs when both the scale and the origin of the ofc are tuned to match those of the cavity grid . in our system , @xmath14 ( controlled by the cavity length ) , and @xmath9 are tuned to match @xmath8 and the cavity offset frequency @xmath17 respectively .",
    "a large fraction of the ofc modes are transmitted simultaneously through the cavity , which can be expressed as @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) where the integer m is the order of the longitudinal cavity mode .",
    "this reference position is easily identified by applying a small cavity - length modulation , for instance with one of its mirrors mounted on a piezo - transducer ( pzt ) .",
    "the global effect of this length - detuning is to dilate / compress the cavity grid , but at first order ( if all intracavity dispersion sources such as mirror coatings or gas pressure are neglected ) it shifts all the laser teeth out of resonance simultaneously .",
    "filtering out the laser repetition rate , the optical power signal measured at the cavity output when a small dithering is applied around the pm resembles the signal obtained with a single frequency continuous - wave laser : a resonance curve corresponding to the airy function ( a lorentzian line shape at high finesse ) if the scanning speed guarantees the adiabatic response of the cavity , and the emergence of a more and more pronounced ringing when the scanning speed is increased @xcite . for a cavity length ( round - trip ) detuning corresponding to @xmath20 , the longitudinal cavity mode of order @xmath21 reaches the laser mode @xmath11 and secondary peaks appears in transmission . due to the slight @xmath14 variation , all the laser teeth can no longer enter in resonance simultaneously , and only a partial ofc is transmitted simultaneously through the cavity : if the equality @xmath18 @xmath22 is satisfied for one laser mode , the following mode will be slightly shifted with its corresponding cavity resonance , and hence , partially transmitted through the lorentzian line shape .",
    "the secondary transmission peak is thus weaker in intensity and broader than the pm position .",
    "this situation is schematically depicted on fig.[pm_and_2pks ] .",
    "the pattern is symmetrical around the pm position .",
    "but if @xmath9 is not initially matched to the cavity offset , this symmetry is broken , resulting in a shifted and broadened main feature that is less intense than the pm peak and un - symmetrical neighboring peaks .     around @xmath23 length at the pm , for matched offset frequencies @xmath24 ( black dotted line ) and mismatched ( red line ) .",
    "( b ) frequency and resonance combs in both cases .",
    "curved arrows indicate the path to reach the matching of the @xmath22th resonance with the nth tooth . in the case where @xmath25 , @xmath14 is already reduced to reach the main peak and a lower reduction",
    "is required to match the @xmath26th resonance .",
    "conversely , a larger increase of @xmath14 is required to match the @xmath27th resonance , reducing the number of teeth simultaneously transmitted and hence the optical power . ]    once this pm position is identified , a cavity length variation @xmath28 of a significant number of laser wavelength which depends on the cavity finesse is applied .",
    "this creates a moir pattern between the laser comb and the grid of cavity resonances where some comb teeth are periodically coupled with a periodicity given by the mismatch @xmath28 . the ofc",
    "cavity - filtered makes appear at the cavity output periodic and controllable vernier coincidences defining the vernier comb .",
    "the vernier comb and its response function can be derived with the cavity transfer function @xmath29 , expressed for the optical power as : @xmath30}\\ ] ] with the cavity finesse @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the round - trip amplitude reflection factor , and the maximum transmission @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the product of the input and output coupler transmission amplitude .",
    "@xmath35 is the phase accumulated over one round - trip , with @xmath36 a constant phase shift of the cavity inducing the cavity offset frequency @xmath37 .",
    "we consider here neither absorption nor phase dispersion . at the perfect",
    "match all the comb frequencies are at perfect resonance , meaning @xmath38 for all integer",
    "n of the laser comb . this can be written as : @xmath39 from which round - trip length at the pm , @xmath40 , and the laser frequency offset at the pm , @xmath41 are deduced from the laser repetition rate .",
    "if the cavity round trip length is now varied by @xmath28 , the round trip phase expressed at the comb frequencies takes the form : @xmath42 where we deliberately introduced a possible variation , @xmath43 , of the laser frequency offset from its value at the pm . finally , with the help of eq.[pm_roundtrip_phase ] , the phase of eq.[roundtrip_phase_comb ] ( modulo @xmath44 ) is rewritten as : @xmath45 the cavity transfer function being described by the airy function ( eq.[cavity transfer function ] ) , the comb tooth of order @xmath11 is coupled ( at least partially ) to a cavity mode when @xmath46 . if furthermore @xmath47 , adjacent teeth are also partially coupled to their respective resonance .",
    "in fact , using eq.[roundtrip_phase_vernier ] , this last relation can be expressed as @xmath48 or equivalently as @xmath49 . in this regime , injecting the round - trip phase expression of eq.[roundtrip_phase_vernier ] in the cavity transfer function ( eq.[cavity transfer function ] ) , a new airy function is obtained .",
    "this function , plotted as a solid line in fig.[verniercomb ] , has the following expression when sampled by the teeth of the ofc : @xmath50}\\ ] ] and corresponds to the envelope of vernier coincidences .",
    "it can be viewed as the response function of the vernier filtering process , a comb of equally spaced lorentzian profiles .",
    "measuring the optical power transmitted through such a profile with a bandpass detector lower than the laser repetition rate eliminates the tooth structure and gives a weighted average frequency for the kth order given by : @xmath51    corresponding to central frequency of the profile .",
    "the spacing between successive orders is the free spectral range of the vernier comb and is given by @xmath52 .",
    "the vernier comb origin has an offset frequency , @xmath53 , directly linked to the offset frequency of the ofc with respect to the cavity .",
    "an important property appearing in view of eq.[vernier_airy_function ] where the factor multiplying the sine function is unchanged with respect to eq.[cavity transfer function ] , is that the cavity finesse also corresponds to the finesse of the vernier comb .",
    "hence , each profile has a linewidth @xmath54 given by @xmath55 . for cavity finesses in the thousand range ,",
    "a 100 mhz repetition rate mode - locked laser can provide vernier order linewidth in the ghz range ( ten successive teeth ) with a vernier comb easily spectrally resolved using standard optical diffraction devices as a moderate resolution of 1 thz is required here .",
    "eq.[order_frequency ] reveals an other important feature of the vernier comb .",
    "order frequencies of the vernier comb are defined by just three free parameters : @xmath8 , setting the cavity length @xmath23 , the mismatch from this length @xmath28 , and the difference between offset frequencies @xmath56 .",
    "any drift or fluctuation of two of those free parameters can thus be balanced by the control of the third .",
    "this property will be exploited to lock the order frequency to a desired value .    finally ,",
    "introducing the factor @xmath57 as the inverse of the relative vernier mismatch , all parameters of the vernier comb , @xmath58 , and the profile linewidth @xmath54 can be written as : @xmath59 showing that , as long as @xmath60 , the vernier coupling magnifies the cavity spectral structure probed by the ofc by the factor @xmath61 .",
    "for an empty cavity , the complete expression of the power transmitted from the kth vernier order corresponds to the sum of all transmitted power by adjacent coupled teeth and is given by : @xmath62 where the sine function of eq.[vernier_airy_function ] has been linearized around the vernier order frequency @xmath63 and the relation @xmath64 has been used .",
    "@xmath65 is the index of the laser tooth closest to @xmath63 and @xmath66 the spectral power of the laser comb .",
    "the sum is applied over half of the @xmath67 on each side of the vernier order , which corresponds to @xmath68 in terms of teeth number .",
    "if sufficient adjacent teeth are included under a vernier order envelope , this sum expression can be written as an integral form as : @xmath69 where the position of the laser teeth under the envelope does not appear anymore .",
    "the integral form thus provides a useful analytical expression to process the measured power as tooth position information is not required ( the measured power is insensitive to the location of teeth within the envelope ) .",
    "provided this integral form is appropriate , free - running mode - locked lasers where the whole comb is affected by spectral drift and noise can be used .",
    "we have already seen that this noise can be balanced with the cavity length to not affect the vernier frequency .",
    "now it also appears that it does not affect the transmitted power if the integral form applies .",
    "this is the main feature of continuous vernier filtering .",
    "the power transmitted from an order when its frequency is scanned is only affected by the laser spectrum envelope variation ; the ofc filtering process is continuous . assuming a constant power per tooth @xmath70 , the cavity transmission is constant and simply given by area of the lorentzian profile : + @xmath71 , where the ratio @xmath72 derived with the help of eq.[gamma_v ] , appears as the number of teeth included in the vernier order linewidth .",
    "obviously , in cavity enhanced molecular spectroscopy , the cavity transmission is not constant anymore and we will discuss in the section [ subsec contvernfiltandabsorption ] the modification of eq.[vernier_airy_function ] in presence of intracavity absorption . in any case , it is useful to evaluate the limit of the continuous filtering process as it gives a range of validity and the highest resolution ( the lower value of @xmath54 ) accessible with this approach .",
    "this has been done numerically and the result is plotted in fig.[modulation ] . for a chosen number of teeth @xmath72 in the kth order linewidth , the cavity transmission is simulated using eq.[vernierpower_sum ] when the order frequency is scanned over few @xmath8 around the reference frequency @xmath73 .",
    "the number @xmath72 and the cavity finesse determine the mismatch length as @xmath74 and the frequency scan is induced by a slight variation @xmath75 around the round trip length @xmath76 .",
    "eq.[order_frequency ] provides the needed length variation to scan @xmath8 , @xmath77 , which itself depends on the mismatch .",
    "the power oscillates with a period of @xmath8 when the vernier order envelope slides across the laser teeth .",
    "it is clearly visible in fig.[modulation ] when few teeth form the envelope and it disappears progressively when the number increases .",
    "the average cavity transmission is given by the area of the lorentzian curve and it corresponds directly to ratio @xmath72 when it is normalized by @xmath78 .",
    "the right axis of the graph indicates the value of the length mismatch @xmath28 for each curve , and it corresponds to the inverse of @xmath72 when expressed in unit of @xmath79 .",
    "finally , the graph above the figure shows the residual modulation amplitude as a function of the number of teeth where it appears that the amplitude reduction is fast and at @xmath80 , the modulation is already below @xmath81 . in practice , it is the level of experimental noise which sets the limit but it is hardly below this value and we can reasonably affect a number of five teeth in the linewidth of the vernier order profile as the limit of our approach .",
    "for a 100 mhz mode locked laser , an ultimate resolution of 500 mhz is attainable .",
    "data acquisition rates are of course linked by the rate at which vernier orders can be scanned .",
    "this limit is set by the condition needed to retrieve quantitative absorption measurement through the use of the cavity transfer function . in order to let the resonating optical field build up to its maximum value where the cavity transfer function applies",
    ", cavity resonances have to be swept across a laser tooth in a time longer than the cavity response time : @xmath82 .",
    "this defines the adiabatic cavity excitation and the adiabatic scanning speed , @xmath83 , when single frequency lasers are used . in the vernier coupling case ,",
    "the sweep of the resonance grid over a given spectral range induces a sweep of vernier orders over a frequency range magnified by the magnification factor @xmath61 . as illustrated in fig.[fig_scanningspeed ] , when resonances are swept over @xmath84 , vernier orders are swept over @xmath54 .",
    "the adiabatic frequency scanning speed of vernier orders thus corresponds to the adiabatic frequency scanning speed of the cavity magnified by @xmath61 : @xmath85 .",
    "this enables to cover extremely broad spectral range in a reasonable time .",
    "when the cavity is filled with an analyte absorbing in the spectral range covered by the laser , the vernier comb response function , which includes several cavity resonances , has to be modified in such a way that all effects affecting resonances are taken into account .",
    "their amplitudes are reduced by absorption , their linewidths increased , but also their frequencies are shifted due to the small phase dispersion induced by resonant absorption .",
    "this phase dispersion stretches the cavity fsr under the line core and slightly compresses it into wings @xcite .",
    "the main absorption effect on a vernier order power is of course its reduction .",
    "however , in the continuous vernier filtering limit , if effects are independently compared , the one on the amplitude reduces the power whereas the one on linewidth acts in opposite way as it slightly increases the teeth coupling and hence the power .",
    "the impact of @xmath86 variations is more subtle and appears to discriminate the sign of the vernier mismatch .",
    "for instance , for negative values of @xmath28 , @xmath86 is larger than @xmath8 .",
    "the fsr stretch into the line core thus further reduces the teeth coupling , and reduces the transmitted power .",
    "the situation is reversed for positive values where @xmath86 is lower than @xmath8 resulting into a tooth - coupling increase into the line core . for both signs , the opposite discussion holds in the line wings .",
    "experiment confirms that raw measured absorption profiles are dependent on the mismatch sign .",
    "measured absorption profiles in the continuous vernier filtering limit are not a straightforward convolution of the absorption line with the empty cavity response function . this effect is depicted in fig . [ fig.signdl ] showing some transitions recorded in ambient air taken with mismatch on either side of the pm .",
    "it is here clearly visible that contrasts and lineshapes are affected by the sign of the vernier mismatch .    to derive the full vernier response function , it is preferable to start here with the cavity transfer function expressed for the electric field : @xmath87 where the absorption per unit length @xmath88 is introduced and where the round - trip phase now includes an absorption - induced dispersion term : @xmath89 the absorption - induced phase : @xmath90 , is derived from the optical index variation @xmath91 , induced by absorption which is itself deduced from the absorption coefficient through the kramers - kronig relations .",

    "the three effects of absorption are clearly identified , and this expression reveals that the two spectral features , linewidth and shift , of a cavity resonance , are here again magnified by the @xmath98 factor .",
    "moreover , it also shows that the sign of @xmath28 now affects the response function .",
    "being quadratic , it does not impact the linewidth term , but the shift is sign - dependent . using the factor @xmath61 , the vernier response function can be written as : @xmath99}\\right]^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is now defined with the absolute value of @xmath61 and , in the continuous vernier filtering limit , the power transmitted from the kth vernier order as : @xmath100 of course , expression [ vernierpower_int ] is retrieved if @xmath101 .",
    "eqs.[vernier_resp_func_abs ] and [ vernierpower_int_abs ] define the analytical function used to retrieve absorption spectrum from the measured cavity transmission . once an absorption profile adapted to the thermodynamic conditions is selected , this function requires to apply the kramers - kronig relations to express @xmath102 as a function of the fitted parameters .",
    "as will be shown in the following , despite the fact that absorption varies significantly over the integration range , standard non - linear fitting algorithms efficiently converge to retrieve absorption spectra . for extremely low absorption coefficient ,",
    "however , expressions can be simplified by neglecting the tiny effect of absorption phase and by applying first order expansions to @xmath103 and the vernier response function to be expanded as : @xmath104 which can be further reduced to : @xmath105 in this regime of extremely weak absorption , the fractional power reduction is then simply given by : @xmath106 corresponding to the intuitive cavity - enhanced absorption loss convoluted with the normalized lorentzian profile of the vernier order .",
    "the factor 2 results from the integration over the profile , similarly to what is obtained in integrated cavity enhanced approach @xcite .    from a more general point of view , we see that the vernier coupling in the continuous limit induces a situation with respect to resolved absorption lines which is almost equivalent to what is obtained when dealing with cavity resonance linewidth in the same range as the absorption linewidth . in this particular case which could be encountered in cavity - enhanced saturated - absorption spectroscopy , the absorption phase also distorts the spectral lineshape of the resonance .",
    "however , the sign of this phase is here controllable with the sign of the vernier mismatch .",
    "the set - up is described in fig.[fig.setup ] .",
    "the fc is provided by a 90mhz mode - locked ti : sapphire laser with a fwhm bandwidth of 30thz centered at @xmath107=785 nm delivering an average output power of around 0.5w .",
    "the beam is mode - matched to the open - air optical cavity formed by four broad - band dielectric mirrors in a bow tie arrangement , lowering high order modes excitation below the percent level .",
    "input and output couplers have a nominal transmission of 0.1% and dominate cavity losses , resulting in a cavity finesse @xmath108 .",
    "one of the two other mirrors is mounted on a fast piezo - transducer ( pzt1 ) with the holder described in @xcite .",
    "the second is also mounted on a piezo - transducer ( pzt2 ) with a travel range of 20@xmath109 m and is supported by a translation stage .",
    "the cavity round - trip length is around 333 cm , and the perfect - match length @xmath23 is found by modulating the pzt2 with an amplitude of a few @xmath109 m and by translating the stage , looking at a photo - detector signal temporarily placed just after the output mirror . from this position , the cavity length is adjusted to the desired value of @xmath76 with the translation stage .",
    "the output beam is then sent onto a 1200l / mm optical grating which diffracts vernier orders in the horizontal plane .",
    "this way , any variation of their frequency induces variation of their location in this plane .",
    "one of them is selected by a split - photodiode ( spd ) .",
    "the current difference of the two elements is amplified to provide a position error signal with a 100khz bandpass .",
    "it results in a frequency error signal which is converted into a correction signal through a integrator - proportional - integrator and sent back to the fast pzt1 .",
    "this closed - loop stabilizes the selected vernier orders optical frequency at a 100mhz level with a bandpass of 20khz filtering out efficiently thermal , mechanical and acoustic noise .",
    "a periodic frequency scan of the vernier order is then obtained by applying an oscillating voltage to the galvo - scanner rotating the grating . the same voltage ( adapted in phase and amplitude )",
    "is also applied to pzt2 as a feed - forward signal in order to reduce the range of the correction signal , which then essentially images relative fluctuations between the comb and the cavity .",
    "it can be noticed that a @xmath110-phase shift of the feed - forward and correction signals is applied when the vernier mismatch sign is changed .",
    "the power transmitted from the vernier order is obtained by the sum of the amplified currents of the spd elements .",
    "this signal , translating the laser spectrum affected by the cavity enhanced absorption , is then sent to a 16-bit analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) during a half period of the oscillating signal also used to trig the acquisition .",
    "the data treatment is processed in a labview environment during the second half the period . in view of eq.[order_frequency ] , the vernier order frequency could , in principle , be deduced from the knowledge of @xmath28 during the scan",
    ". it also requires the precise knowledge of the offset frequency mismatch @xmath56 , of the laser repetition rate from which is deduced @xmath23 and an accurate calibration of the pzt response .",
    "however , the cavity gdd , which depends on the used mirrors but also on the gas pressure , slowly varies the cavity free spectral range and must also be accurately determined to correct for the slight deviation it induces to eq.[order_frequency ] .",
    "we circumvent those difficulties by sending a part of the selected beam onto a solid glass talon without coating and a thickness of 1 cm . the reflected beam measured with a photodiode",
    "is also sent to the adc .",
    "once normalized by the sum spd signal , this talon signal gives a quasi - sine function from which is extracted , during the data treatment time , a quasi - linear relative frequency scale with a wavenumber sampling around 0,333@xmath0 .",
    "this way , the cavity transmission on a relative frequency scale is obtained at each period of the oscillating voltage applied to the galvo - scanner and can be conveniently time - averaged .",
    "the absolute frequency scale of an averaged spectrum is deduced by selecting two observed lines referenced in the hitran database @xcite and placed on each side of the spectrum .",

    "is also plotted with a vertical offset for clarity .",

    "the frequency @xmath115 of the sinewave applied to the galvo scanner is set by the probed optical range and the adiabatic scanning speed @xmath116 which depends on the cavity finesse .",
    "for a finesse value around 3000 , a cavity length of 333 cm , a mismatch of 50@xmath109 m and a spectral coverage of 2000@xmath0 , @xmath115 should not exceed 0.5hz which set the acquisition time to 1s .",
    "also , the spectral resolution of the vernier order ( @xmath117 ) is 2ghz ( corresponding to 0.067@xmath0 ) with those parameters providing 31300 independent spectral elements in 1s . of course",
    ", for such a broadband spectrum , the finesse can not be assumed to be constant over the whole range .",
    "however , based on a finesse measurement outside the molecular bands using the ringing method @xcite in well agreement with the specifications provided by the constructor , the finesse is expected to remain within a variation of less than 20% .",
    "after acquisition , the cavity transmission calibrated against the talon ruler can be averaged thanks to the good stability provided by the correction loop . to demonstrate the precision of the relative frequency axis over several measurements , three broadband normalized cavity transmissions are shown in fig.[reproducibility](a )",
    "( offseted for clarity ) , where it is already visible that no major frequency shift is observed .",
    "the three spectra are superimposed and enlarged in panel ( b ) together with a benchmark of 100mhz , confirming the previous statement of a spectral stabilization at 100mhz level .",
    "thus the successive spectra can be efficiently averaged several times without being affected by the drift of the talon fringes due to the low frequency thermal noise .",

    "we have developed a formalism that comprehends the whole behavior of the vernier coupling of a frequency comb into a mismatch cavity .",

    "the cavity dispersion , that is one of the major bandwidth limitations of other direct frequency comb cavity - enhanced spectroscopy techniques , does not have to be considered in this formalism .",
    "this is enlighten by our ability to measure spectra that cover 2100@xmath0 , which would be impossible with any other tight - locked technique .",
    "the vernier order filtered by the cavity is yet tightly locked with a simple locking technique which is both robust and inexpensive .",
    "the combination of the grating with the split photodiode exploited here effectively stabilize the cavity resonances in regards of the comb modes at 100mhz level , already enough to be able to average the successive spectra .",
    "this gives high signal to noise ratio , which actually makes essential to implement the voigt profile in our model to describe with better veracity the actually doppler broadened measured lineshapes .",
    "the overall performance gives a figure of merit equal to 1.1@xmath12310@xmath5@xmath125 which compares well with the other comb - based spectroscopy techniques , and absorption detection down to the level of 7@xmath12310@xmath128@xmath0 has been demonstrated .",
    "the technique only require the additional measurement of the cavity finesse and of the length mismatch @xmath130l to precisely calibrate the absorption scale .",
    "on the other hand , the frequency calibration is realized with the relative frequency ruler provided by the low finesse talon , that contribute to the simplicity of the setup and is already enough precise for the presented measurements .",
    "yet , this calibration could be made more accurate by replacing the solid talon by a stabilized michelson interferometer and by adding an absolute reference in the ofc beam path .",
    "further developments of the spectrometer include a vacuum cell containing the cavity in order to reliably control the probed gas settings , and to measure accurately the cavity finesse by ringdown measurement over the whole spectral range",
    ". this will also enable to measure the real background of the absorption spectrum , thus opening up to the detection of broad spectral features such as large molecules or aerosols .",
    "anyhow , the vernier spectrometer is already a reliable , simple and low - cost device delivering high sensitivity molecular spectra on a spectral range only limited by the laser bandwidth .",
