    "solutions of the riemann problem in the relativistic hydrodynamics are of crucial importance for the construction of modern numerical schemes designed to solve relativistic euler equations . in most such schemes ,",
    "it is the riemann solver ( usually an approximate one ) that is responsible for the accuracy of the method and a proper resolution of possible shock waves @xcite .",
    "moreover , quite recently aloy and rezzolla applied the analysis of solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamical riemann problem to explain a boosting mechanism occurring in astrophysical jets , proving that the importance of such solutions is not merely academic @xcite .    here by the riemann problem",
    "we understand a cauchy problem for a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations , where initial data consist of two constant states separated by a discontinuity in a form of a plane surface . in the case of hydrodynamics , such an initial discontinuity decays , giving rise to three possible elementary waves : a shock wave , a rarefaction wave , and the so - called contact discontinuity .",
    "the solution of the riemann problem is thus a non - trivial one , and its precise form requires investigation .    the relativistic shock - tube problem , i.e. , a riemann problem with zero initial velocities , was investigated by thompson in @xcite .",
    "later , the riemann problem in one spatial dimension was solved for the ultra - relativistic equation of state by smoller and temple @xcite and for the perfect gas equation of state by mart and mller @xcite .",
    "the latter work was generalized by pons , mart and mller to the case , in which the fluid is allowed to move in the direction tangent to the discontinuity @xcite , but , due to the complexity of equations , the solution had to be computed numerically .",
    "then , in @xcite rezzolla , zanotti and pons introduced a particularly convenient way of classifying the solutions , based on the relative velocity between both riemann states .",
    "an important progress was made by giacomazzo and rezzolla , who analyzed the riemann problem in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics @xcite . a numerical code written for this analysis",
    "was then used to obtain some test solutions of the riemann problem for equations of state other than that of perfect gas @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an analytic solution for the riemann problem with non - zero velocities tangent to the initial discontinuity and the ultra - relativistic equation of state .",
    "this common equation of state is exceptional in the sense that it can not be expressed in terms of the baryonic ( rest mass ) density and the specific internal energy , but it relates the pressure directly to the energy density .",
    "this fact prevented us from a straightforward application of the existing numerical schemes solving relativistic riemann problem . as a benefit we got a solution that can be expressed almost entirely in analytical terms .",
    "solutions of the riemann problem in which tangential velocities do not vanish can be used to construct general numerical schemes that solve equations of hydrodynamics in all three spatial dimensions .",
    "a solver of this kind has been implemented using the solution discussed in @xcite , although it is not given in analytical terms , and , in order to obtain such a solution , one has to integrate a certain ordinary differential equation numerically . in the case",
    "presented here , the appropriate ordinary differential equation was solved analytically , so the implementation of the exact riemann solver is straightforward .",
    "we should also note that the effects caused by the presence of the tangential velocities in the riemann problem are purely relativistic . in newtonian hydrodynamics they do not influence the behavior of the solution in the direction normal to the discontinuity .",
    "thus , in order to extend a given one - dimensional solution to the case with non - zero tangential velocities , it is only required to compute the values of those velocities in the intermediate states . in relativistic hydrodynamics all velocities couple together through lorentz factors , and the presence of tangential velocities changes the solution quantitatively .    throughout this work",
    "we will assume that the reader has a basic knowledge of the riemann problem for general sets of nonlinear hyperbolic equations ( a good introduction can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "ii and iii we will review basic equations constituting our problem . afterward , in secs . iv ",
    "vi we will discuss the structures of rarefaction waves , shock waves and contact discontinuities respectively .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "vii the solutions of the riemann problem will be presented , and in sec .",
    "viii we will compare them to the solutions obtained for the perfect gas equation of state .",
    "a summary of the paper will be given in sec .",
    "the equations expressing the conservation of the energy and momentum in relativistic hydrodynamics are usually written in the following compact form @xmath1 where the energy - momentum tensor is that of perfect fluid , namely @xmath2 here @xmath3 denotes the energy density , @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 are the components of the four - velocity of the fluid , and @xmath6 is the metric tensor of the minkowski space - time . throughout this paper greek indices",
    "will refer to space - time dimensions ( @xmath7 ) , while latin ones will be reserved for spatial dimensions ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we will also work in cartesian coordinates , where @xmath9 .    in order to solve the riemann problem for eqs .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) it is convenient to rewrite them in the form where the derivatives with respect to time and spatial coordinates are separated explicitly . to this end , we introduce the lorentz factor @xmath10 and components of the three - velocity @xmath11 . due to the normalization of the four - velocity @xmath12",
    ", the lorentz factor can be written as @xmath13 . in the above terms eqs .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 here @xmath17 denotes the kronecker s delta .    by the ultra - relativistic equation of state",
    "we understand a relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a constant playing the role of the local speed of sound ( for a photon gas or a gas of neutrinos @xmath20 ) .",
    "this form of equation of state is commonly used in cosmology ; this is also the equation of state assumed in @xcite .",
    "for the ultra - relativistic equation of state ( a barotropic equation of state of the form @xmath21 , in general ) eqs .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) constitute a complete set of equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "on the other hand , the perfect gas equation of state , exploited in most of numerical simulations in relativistic hydrodynamics and in @xcite , has the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a constant , @xmath24 is the so - called baryonic ( or rest mass ) density and @xmath25 denotes the specific internal energy .",
    "the baryonic density is assumed to be a function satisfying the following continuity equation @xmath26 and the specific internal energy is defined as @xmath27 .",
    "thus , for the perfect gas equation of state the equations of hydrodynamics consist of eqs .",
    "( [ energy_momentum_cons ] ) and ( [ baryonic_density_cons ] ) .    for some physical situations",
    "the baryonic density is much smaller than the energy density and @xmath28 . in this",
    "case relations @xmath18 and @xmath29 should be equivalent , provided that @xmath30 .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics suitable for these two equations of state are , however , different and the solutions can differ even qualitatively ( there is , for instance , no contact discontinuity for the ultra - relativistic equation of state and no tangential velocities in the riemann problem , as the pressure is directly proportional to the energy density , and such a discontinuity is present in an analogous solution for the perfect gas equation of state , where the same pressure can correspond to different values of baryonic density ) .",
    "a careful inspection of solutions of the riemann problem in both cases shows that they tend to each other in a suitable sense .",
    "it should , however , be noted that in our case of ultrarelativistic equation of state the solution of the appropriate riemann problem can be found analytically , whereas it was not possible for the case of perfect gas equation of state @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we specialize to the ultrarelativistic equation of state , although many results are more general , valid for barotropic equations of state @xmath21 .",
    "without loss of generality , we will assume that the initial discontinuity is perpendicular to the @xmath31 axis .",
    "thus , neglecting the derivatives with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we can write equations for the riemann problem as @xmath34    the structure of solutions of the relativistic riemann problem is exactly the same as in the corresponding newtonian case , and it is , in fact , shared by general sets of hyperbolic conservation laws ( cf .",

    "the so called rarefaction wave will be further denoted by @xmath43 , where the subscript arrows refer to the direction from which particles of the fluid enter the wave .",
    "the other two elementary waves are discontinuities : a shock wave , denoted by @xmath44 , and a contact discontinuity @xmath45 .",
    "we will also use the symbol @xmath46 to denote a shock wave @xmath44 or a rarefaction wave @xmath43 , when the actual character of the wave is not important .",
    "the decay of the initial state @xmath42 can be symbolically written as @xmath47 which corresponds to four different cases with @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the distinction between a contact discontinuity @xmath45 and a shock wave @xmath50 is based on the behavior of the pressure and the normal velocity ( @xmath51 in our case ) across the discontinuity .",
    "they are assumed to be continuous at the contact discontinuity and exhibit a jump at the shock wave . since for the ultrarelativistic equation of state",
    "the pressure is directly proportional to the energy density , the only quantities that can be discontinuous across a contact discontinuity are the tangential components of the velocity ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "this also means that the pressure , the normal velocity @xmath51 , and , in case of ultra - relativistic equation of state , the energy density are the same in both intermediate states @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the strategy of finding of the solution of the riemann problem can be now summarized as follows .",
    "we start by considering a left moving wave @xmath56 , and obtain the relation between the energy density @xmath57 and the velocity @xmath58 in the region behind such a wave .",
    "next , we repeat the same calculations for the right moving wave @xmath59 , to obtain an analogous relation between the energy density @xmath60 and the velocity @xmath61 . since the energy density and the normal velocity are the same in both intermediate states , they can be computed from the equation @xmath62 .",
    "the solution to this equation also identifies the actual character of both waves @xmath59 and @xmath56 ( the so - called wave pattern ) . we will discuss the actual forms of the relation between the energy density and the normal velocity for all kinds of simple waves in the forthcoming sections",
