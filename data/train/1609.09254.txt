    "the next step is to understand the source of electrons and the mechanism by which they reach the anode surface .",
    "there are several reactions that occur during photosynthesis and a complete description of the process with detailed mechanisms can be very complicated .",
    "therefore , we propose a simple one - step mechanism that results in a tractable and useful model . a good description of processes that happen during photosynthesis can be found in @xcite .    the first step in photosynthesis is the water splitting reaction .",

    "an important point to note at this juncture is that the water splitting reaction is assumed as a representative of all the phenomena that occur in the anode chamber .",
    "this can be summarized in eq .",
    "anode complete reaction @xmath44 here , @xmath45 has much more significance than a mere rate constant of the water splitting reaction since this rate constant represents the reaction rate and also the many transport phenomena that are involved in the movement of all the active species .",

    "this complexity can be handled if we assume that the overall reaction that occurs on the cathode surface as the oxygen reduction reaction ( orr ) .",

    "[ applications ] the model predicted @xmath2 characteristics for different electrode surface areas are shown in the figure [ ae_vi ] .",
    "the model predicts increase in current with increase in electrode surface area which is consistent .",
    "a similar trend was also obtained for power density .",
    "decrease in electrode surface decreases the area available for reactions to occur directly affecting the performance .",
    "this shows that even with the same cell concentrations much better performance might be possible by increasing the electrode surface area .",
    "the @xmath2 characteristics for the response of the system to different light intensities is shown in .",
    "the model predicts decrease in current with decrease in light intensity and vice versa .",
    "one would expect that the current produced should be a very strong function of @xmath103 , but the results show that the current is a weak function of the former . in other words , for this @xmath4 , between increasing the electrode area and light intensity ( or illumination surface area as shown in figure [ as_vi ] ) , the former is preferable .",
    "shows the @xmath2 characteristics for various initial cell concentrations .",
    "the decrease in the current and voltage is observed with decreasing cell concentrations as shown in .",
    "it is observed that the model predicts the current as a weak function of cell concentration .",
    "this is consistent with the other results as the strong dependence on the electrode area shows that the current cell population itself is underutilized and increasing the cell count is not likely to increase current because of the paucity of the active surface area for the electrochemical reactions .",
    "it is important to note that these conclusions are not easy to reach by looking at just the @xmath2 data without this modeling exercise .",
    "this emphasizes the power of this simple model in identifying key performance limiting factors .",
    "when @xmath1 is plotted vs @xmath53 on a log - log graph ( see figure [ goodka ] . ) it can be observed that the experimental data collected for the cell can be divided into two regions . in the first region , the order of @xmath1 is almost constant , i.e , the cell is being operated in an ohmic region , where the performance is not mass transfer limited .",
    "the reactants are supplied at electrodes at the same rate at which the reactants are used up in reaction .",
    "the second regime where @xmath1 decreases as a power law , corresponds to the reaction rate limiting region ( activation regime ) of the operation of the cell .",
    "the sudden drop of voltage from @xmath55 in v - i profile , which corresponds to the activation loss dominant regime , is captured by large changes in parameter k.    the key parameter in the @xmath4 model is k , which represents the several transport phenomena and the rates of reactions . the k is related to @xmath104 through @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath105 also has an interpretation of a charge transfer coefficient in butler - volmer equation , which is typically assumed to be @xmath106 .",
    "however , in our optimization approach whenever the range of @xmath105 was fixed as @xmath107 , there were discontinuities in the estimated values of @xmath1 as shown in the log - log plot of @xmath1 vs @xmath53 in figure [ worstk ] . however , for a small @xmath105 value as used in our model , we could observe the natural two power law region curves as shown in figure [ vi_test ] .",
    "hence , a value of @xmath108 was chosen , which is still in the acceptable range of @xmath109 .",
    "it is also worthwhile to keep in mind that the complicated multi - step photosynthesis reaction mechanism has been simplified into a single water splitting reaction step and hence the charge transfer coefficient can only be thought of as another parameter in the model .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that when @xmath110 is used to fit the v - i data , k is almost of the same order of magnitude in the lower current regime and then varies significantly in the high current regime .",
    "that is , @xmath110 fits the data into the regimes where ohmic losses and mass transfer losses are dominant .",
    "however , for @xmath111 , data was fit to regimes where ohmic losses and activation losses are dominant as mentioned before .",
    "the reason for a smooth fit for @xmath111 compared to @xmath110 could be because the experimental data that was used for parameter estimation lies in the region of dominant ohmic and activation losses .",
    "a mathematical model to predict the performance of a @xmath4 was developed .",
    "the model was thoroughly validated with steady - state experimental @xmath2 data .",
    "it was shown that this model could be used to predict the behavior of the @xmath0psc that was considered .",
    "several insights provided by the model regarding the operation of the @xmath4 were described . for this particular design ,",
    "the model was able to unequivocally identify that the performance limitation as largely due to lack of enough active sites for reaction and not cell concentration or light intensity .",
    "as future work , if the model is extended to include the geometry of the electrode patterns , diffusion phenomena , and the multi - step reaction processes that occur , then it can be used to comprehensively optimize the various design and operational parameters of a @xmath0psc .",
