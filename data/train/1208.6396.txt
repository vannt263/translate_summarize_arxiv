    "early studied in the 1930 s @xcite , the counter - rotating machines arouse a greater interest in the turbomachinery field , particularly for their potential improvement of the efficiency with respect to conventional machines by recovering kinetic energy from the front rotor exit - flow and by adding energy to the flow .",
    "the first counter - rotating machines have appeared in aeronautic @xcite and marine applications @xcite in open configuration .",
    "conventional designs of high speed counter - rotating fans are based on quite expensive methods and require a systematic coming and going between theoretical methods  such as the lifting line theory or the strip - analysis approach @xcite and cfd analysis @xcite .",
    "moreover , the axial spacing , which has a major role on the rotors interaction and consequently on the noise @xcite , is a key parameter to find a compromise between high aerodynamic and good acoustic performance for high speed fans @xcite . in order to reduce this interaction ,",
    "the axial spacing of high speed fans has to be relatively large , resulting in a decrease in the aerodynamic performance @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , the rear rotor ( rr ) diameter has to be smaller ( about 10@xmath2 according to @xcite ) than the front rotor ( fr ) diameter to reduce interaction between the fr tip vortex and the rr blade tip .",
    "contrary to that , in the case of low speed fans axial spacing could be shortened using the benefit of a relatively low rotor interaction .",
    "therefore these machines see a revival of interest in several distinct configurations open and ducted flows , shrouded or not shrouded rotors in various subsonic regime applications @xcite .",
    "recent research work dealt with the effects of global parameters like rotation speed ratio @xcite , local phenomena such as tip vortex flows @xcite and improvement of cavitation performance for pumps @xcite .",
    "all previous studies have shown the benefit of rr in improving the global efficiency and in increasing the operating flow - rate range while maintaining high efficiency .",
    "the counter - rotating systems ( crs ) moreover allow to reduce the fans diameter and/or to reduce the rotation rate .",
    "more axial spacing is needed compared to one simple fan , but not much more than a rotor - stator stage .",
    "however , it requires a more complex shaft system .",
    "another interesting feature of crs is that it makes it possible to design axial - flow fans with very low angular specific speed @xmath3 with @xmath4 the mean angular velocity , @xmath5 the flow rate , @xmath6 the total pressure rise , and @xmath7 the fluid density . with such advantages ,",
    "the crs becomes a very interesting solution and the interaction between the rotors needs to be better understood in order to design highly efficient crs .",
    "however , only a few studies have been concerned with , on the one hand , the effect of the axial spacing , and , on the other hand , the design method @xcite , particularly with rotors load distribution for a specified design point .",
    "this paper focuses on two major parameters of ducted counter - rotating axial - flow fans in subsonic regime : the rotation rate ratio , @xmath8 and the relative axial spacing , @xmath9 . in some cases ,",
    "these systems are studied by using two identical rotors or the rr is not specifically designed to operate with the fr . in this study , the fr is designed as conventional rotor and the rr is designed on purpose to work with the fr at very small axial spacing . in this first design , the total work to perform by the crs was arbitrarily set up approximately to two halves one half respectively for the fr and rr . in   [ sec : design ] the method that has been used to design the front and the rear rotors is firstly described .",
    "the experimental set - up is presented in   [ sec : setup ] .",
    "then the overall performances of the system in its default configuration and the effects of varying the rotation ratio and the relative axial spacing between the rotors are discussed in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "the design of the rotors is based on the use of the software mft ( mixed flow turbomachinery ) , a 1d code developed by the dynfluid laboratory @xcite based on the inverse method with simplified radial equilibrium to which an original method has been added specifically for the design of the rr of the counter - rotating system .    from the specified total pressure rise , volume flow - rate and rotating speed , optimal values of the radii @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "are first proposed . in a second step",
    ", the tip and the hub radii as well as the radial distribution of the circumferential component of the velocity at the rotor outlet , @xmath12 , could be changed by the user .",
    "the available vortex models are the free vortex ( @xmath13 ) , the constant vortex ( @xmath14 ) and the forced vortex ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the velocity triangles are then computed for @xmath16 radial sections , based on the euler equation for perfect fluid with a rough estimate of the efficiency of @xmath17 and on the equation of simplified radial equilibrium ( radial momentum conservation ) .",
    "the blades can then be defined by the local resolution of an inverse problem considering a 2d flow and searching for the best suited cascade to the proposed velocity triangles by the following parameters : @xmath18 the stagger angle , computed from the incidence angle , @xmath19 giving the lower pressure variation on the suction surface of the blade using equations [ eq : gamma ] and [ eq : a ] .",
    "the solidity , @xmath20 and the chord length , @xmath21 are thus computed at the hub and at the tip using equations [ eq : sigma ] and [ eq : c ] where @xmath22 denotes the lieblein s diffusion factor@xcite .",
    "the intermediate chords are obtained by linearisation . finally , the camber coefficients @xmath23 are computed using equation [ eq : coef_port ] . @xmath24",
    "these empirical equations have been validated for naca-65 cascades @xcite , for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "velocity triangles for the crs .",
    "the fluid is flowing from left to right .",
    ", width=294 ]    the behaviour of the designed machine resulting from the above method can then be analysed using a direct method in order to determine whether the design point is achieved and what are the characteristics of the machine at the neighbourhood of the design point .",
    "the effects due to real fluid are taken partially into account with in - house loss models and the introduction of an axial - velocity distribution which considers the boundary layers at the hub and casing .",
    "thus , the characteristics of the machine can be obtained in the vicinity of the design - point discharge . regarding the crs , the geometrical dimensions , the number of blades of fr and of rr and their rotation rates are imposed . in particular , the number of blades of each rotor was chosen in order to prevent to have the same blade passing frequency or harmonics for both rotors in the lower frequencies range .",
    "the system that is presented here has moreover been designed to have a pure axial exit - flow .",
    "an iterative procedure is then performed .",
    "the pressure rise of the fr is initially chosen and then designed and quickly analysed as explained .",
    "an estimate of the pressure rise that rr would made is then performed , based on this analysis .",
    "if the total pressure rise of the crs is not met , the design pressure rise of fr is varied and the calculus are made again . in this method ,",
    "losses and interactions in - between the two rotors are not taken into account .",
    "any recirculation happening near the blade passage or near the blade hub or tip is not predicted by mft as it is based on simplified radial equilibrium .      .",

    "[ fig : trianglevit ] and considering the case with the fr coupled to the rr : the incoming velocity @xmath45=@xmath46 has an axial component as well as a tangential component .",

    "awaiting for more accurate local measurements of the flow angle at the exit of the crs , a simple test of flow visualization with threads affixed downstream of the crs was performed .",
    "it has been observed that without the rr the flow is very disorganized .",
    "when the rr is operating , at the design configuration ( @xmath36 and @xmath62 ) , the flow is less turbulent , the threads are oriented with a small angle at the exit .",
