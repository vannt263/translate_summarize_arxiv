    "type iin supernovae ( sne iin ) form an interesting group of objects whose observed properties ( high luminosity , slow light curve decline , spectra with multicomponent lines , with very narrow emission features and without broad p ",
    "cygni absorptions ) are interpreted in terms of quick reprocessing of the mechanical energy of the sn explosion via interaction between the sn ejecta and a pre  existent circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "most iin events are thought to be core  collapse explosions .",
    "however , recently , some authors proposed that also thermonuclear sne may explode within a h  rich cs environment , producing iin  like spectra ( see sn 2002ic , e.g. hamuy et al .",
    "2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "sn 1995n , discovered when it was about 10 months old @xcite , is one of the best observed sne iin so far .",
    "due to its vicinity , the peripheral location in the host galaxy and the exceptional duration of the interaction ejecta ",
    "csm , it is an ideal target for a long  term monitoring at all wavelengths .",
    "sn 1995n has been studied from x  ray to radio wavelengths .",
    "briefly , x  ray band observations are reported by @xcite , mucciarelli et al . and zampieri et al . .",
    "optical spectroscopy is presented by @xcite , late time optical photometry by @xcite , and near ir photometry by @xcite . moreover ,",
    "a few sparse radio observations are available in @xcite and in the web site of k. w. weiler and the radio  sn collaboration .",
    "we have increased the available data set of sn 1995n with new optical and ir observations , obtained over a period of @xmath09 years ( 19952004 ) .",
    "these new data will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] ( left ) ,  light curves of sn 1995n are reported .",
    "together with our unpublished data , also data from other sources @xcite are shown .",
    "the very slow magnitude decrease in all bands is remarkable : the observations provide an average decline rate of about 0.10 mag/100 days ( over a period of 9 years ) in v band , and @xmath0 0.19 mag/100 days ( over more than 7 years ) in k band .",
    "another interesting property of sn  1995n and other sne iin , discussed also by @xcite , is the huge k band excess , attributed to dust emission .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) shows the absolute r band light curve of sn 1995n compared with those of other interacting sne : 1988z ( aretxaga et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) , 1997cy @xcite , 1995n @xcite , 1998s @xcite and 1999el @xcite .",
    "the light curve of the non  interacting sn 1987a ( whitelock et al .",
    "1989 , and references therein ) is also shown . adopting the explosion epoch of sn  1995n reported by @xcite ,",
    "this object is about 1 magnitude fainter than sn  1988z , even if their light curves are very similar in shape .",
    "+ we remark that a recent observation of sn  1995n ( on july 2004 , i.e. @xmath010 years after explosion ) , shows the object clearly visible in all optical bands .",
    "a detailed analysis of the early time spectra and the line identification is presented by @xcite .",
    "we have obtained a large number of spectra of this object ( more than 30 ) during the period 19952004 , and a small sample of our data set is shown in fig .",
    "we remark the very slow spectral evolution of this sn .",
    "the spectra are dominated by the h@xmath1 emission during the first @xmath0 4 years , then the forbidden o lines ( especially [ oiii ] 49595007  , [ o i ] 63006364  , [ o ii ] 73207330  ) increase in strength with time and become comparable with h@xmath1 at about phase 8 years . while broader components ( @xmath2 3000 km s@xmath3 ) are still visible in the last available spectrum , the narrow unresolved , highly ionized , forbidden lines of o , fe , ne , ar , are detected only at early epochs , i.e. until phase of @xmath0 34 years .",
    "h@xmath1 is particularly prominent , and its luminosity evolution appears to be similar to that observed for sn  1988z @xcite , peaking between 1 and 2 years after the sn explosion .",
    "after including all the data available in the literature , we estimate the x  ray to radio energy output of sn 1995n .",
    "we find that the major contribution to the total energy comes from the ir flux , as already noted for other sne iin @xcite .",
    "the k band luminosity is exceptionally high , especially until phase @xmath0 2000 days .",
    "later the x  ray luminosity ( range 0.210 kev ) exceeds the k band one .    we compute the total energy emitted in each band integrating the corresponding light curves over the period of the available observations : the integrated energy in the u , v , i , j bands is about 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 ergs , a factor 2 times larger for the b and h bands , 4 times for the r band and a 56 times for the k band and the 0.210 kev region .",
    "note also that the radio flux contributes only marginally to the total energy , lying about 4 order of magnitudes below the optical one .",
    "moreover we estimate the ionizing radiation absorbed by the cool material from the flux of h@xmath6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "interpolating at missing epochs and roughly assuming that the light curve is flat during the first unobserved 10 months , we compute the x  ray , uv ionizing continuum , optical and ir energy emitted by sn  1995n over 10 years .",
    "the integration provides a value of e@xmath7 @xmath0 3 @xmath4 10@xmath8 ergs .",
    "because other sne iin ( e.g. 1988z ) show a luminosity peak during the period 0300 days , such value of e@xmath7 should be considered as a lower limit for the total energy emitted by sn  1995n .",
    "a reasonable estimate is e@xmath9 10@xmath10 ergs , not far from the classical value of non  interacting cc ",
    "sne and about one order of magnitude smaller than estimated for sn 1988z @xcite .",
