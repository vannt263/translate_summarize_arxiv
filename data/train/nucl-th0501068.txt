    "the study of neutron  proton pairing , especially in the t=0 channel , is a particularly prominent topic these days . while the number of journal articles are far too numerous to reference , one might begin to make some headway into the varied approaches by starting from the references found in refs",
    ".  @xcite . in",
    "so doing one will find a field of study filled with disagreement and occasionally strife .",
    "for example , macchiavelli et  al .",
    "@xcite claim that some apparent indicators of t=0 pairing can really be explained in terms of symmetry energies . in their abstract they say `` after correcting for the energy we find that the lowest t=1 state in odd ",
    "odd n = z nuclei is as bound as the ground state in the neighboring even  even nucleus , thus providing evidence for isovector np pairing .",
    "however the t=0 states in odd ",
    "odd n = z nuclei are several mev less bound than the even  even ground states ... there is no evidence for an isoscalar ( deuteron like ) pair condensate in n = z nuclei . ''",
    "while in this work we do not want to get into the arguments between this group and others on this point , we find their work a useful source of motivation for this present study .    in this work we will examine the yrast spectra of the even  even ( fp ) shell nuclei @xmath0ti , @xmath1ti , @xmath2ti , @xmath2cr and @xmath3cr , as well as the odd  odd nucleus @xmath1v .",
    "we will perform full fp shell calculations and compare the spectra to experiment . for comparison purposes we also discuss the odd a nucleus @xmath6sc ( @xmath6ti ) and the odd",
    " odd nucleus @xmath1v .    in this work",
    "we perform the shell model calculations using the shell model code antoine  @xcite . in order to best see the effects of the t=1 and t=0 interactions ,",
    "we perform two sets of calculations . in the first we use the fpd6 interaction  @xcite",
    ". then we do the same calculations but we set all the t=0 two - body interaction matrix elements to zero",
    ". we shall denote this interaction as t0fpd6 .",
    "( this modification of an effective interaction is along the same lines of that used by satula et  al . to examine wigner energies a few years ago  @xcite . )",
    "we have used this modification of fpd6 in the past to study a variety of things and in particular the full fp spectrum of @xmath0ti  @xcite .    it should be noted that in refs .",
    "@xcite a wide range of topics is addressed beyond the spectra of even  even nuclei .",
    "these topics include a partial dynamical symmetry that arises when one uses the t0fpd6 interaction in a single j shell for @xmath6sc and @xmath0ti . also , while using the t0fpd6 interaction , a subtle relationship between the t=@xmath7 states in @xmath6sc and the t=@xmath8 states in @xmath6ca can be observed , likewise between the t=@xmath9 states in @xmath0ti and t=@xmath10 states in @xmath0ca .",
    "we also considered even ",
    "odd nuclei and addressed the topic of how the t=0 two - body matrix elements affect b(m1 ) transitions  both spin and orbital components , and gamow  teller transitions . in many cases the transition rates were very sensitive to the presence or absence of the t=0 matrix elements .",
    "this was especially the case for some orbital b(m1 ) s and the gamow  teller transitions .    here",
    "things will be kept simple and we focus on the spectra and b(e2 ) s of the yrast levels of selected even  even nuclei .",
    "we will examine the sensitivity of these observables on the t=0 two - body interaction matrix elements by setting them to zero and comparing the results thus obtained with those when the t=0 matrix elements are reintroduced .",
    "the t0fpd6 interaction is not expected to give good binding energies  clearly the t=0 two - body matrix elements are important here . nor is it expected to give the relative energies of states of different isospins in a nucleus .",
    "this can be partially compensated by adding a two - body monopole interaction in the t=0 channel @xmath11 , which for t=0 would be @xmath12 .",
    "such monopole interactions have been studied in the past  @xcite .",
    "however this interaction will not affect the energy differences of states with the same isospin and it will not affect the b(e2 ) rates .    it should be emphasized that t=0 two - body matrix elements are very important for binding energies .",
    "this is especially made clear by the schematic models of chasman where it is shown that both t=0 and t=1 matrix elements are important in describing the wigner energy  @xcite . in this work , however , we are focusing on spectra .",
    "our entry to this problem considered here was to note that in a single j shell calculation of @xmath0ti the results for the even @xmath13 states were almost the same when the t=0 two - body matrix elements of the fpd6 interaction were set equal to zero as they were in a full calculation .",
    "this figure is shown in reference  @xcite .",
    "there is an offset of the odd @xmath13 states .",
    "however we point out that none of the odd @xmath13 states have been found experimentally . in this report",
    "we provide an important source of motivation for experiments that should be done .",
    "it should be pointed out that in a single j shell calculation ( but not when more than one shell is included ) setting the two - body t=0 matrix elements to a constant will give the same relative spectra of t=0 states in @xmath0ti as will be obtained by setting these to zero .    in another vein we showed that when t=0 two - body matrix elements are set equal to zero one gets a partial dynamical symmetry . for @xmath14 states of @xmath0ti with the following angular momenta @xmath15 , and 12",
    ", the states can be classified by the dual quantum numbers @xmath16 .",
    "however for states with @xmath17 , and 8 no such symmetry exists .",
    "we were able to explain this in part by noting that this symmetry exists only for states with angular momenta which are not present for a system of identical particles , i.e. @xmath0ca .    but even with a full interaction , i.e. when the t=0 matrix elements are present , the t=0 interaction appears to be weak for the states @xmath18 for which the dynamical symmetry exists .",
    "for example , the wave function of the @xmath19 , t=0 state in an mbz calculation is @xmath20^i\\ ] ]       note that the total spread of the t=1 states ( @xmath21 ) is 3.122  mev .",
    "more than three times the spread of the t=0 states ( @xmath22 ) of 0.899  mev .",
    "thus , we can say that , to a first approximation , the t=0 spectrum is almost degenerate , judging by the scale set by the t=1 interaction .",
    "this would then justify the starting point of setting the t=0 matrix elements to a constant .",
    "it is easy to show that in this single @xmath23-shell model space , if one adds a constant to the t=0 matrix elements , it will not affect the wave functions of the states and will not affect the excitation energies of the states which have the same isospin .    it can be seen that the two particle t=1 spectrum in @xmath24sc is quite different from that of a pairing interaction , for which the @xmath25 and 6 states are degenerate .",
    "the fact that the excitation energy of the @xmath26 state is about twice that of the @xmath27 state indicates that other components of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction are present , e.g. , a quadrupole  quadrupole interaction .",
    "hence , the t=1 spectrum of @xmath24sc has built into it some aspects necessary for nuclear collectivity .",
    "the above discussion suggests that , in a full f - p calculation , the single @xmath23 components are sufficiently prevalent so as to get the overall pattern of the spectrum in reasonably good shape .",
    "the higher shell admixtures then readjust the spectrum so as to change from what is roughly a vibrational pattern to a rotational one , and here the t=0 two - body matrix elements play an important role .    in summary , in studying the problem of the t=0 neutron ",
    "proton interaction in a nucleus , it may prove more fruitful to begin by removing this channel altogether as was done here by setting all the t=0 two - body matrix elements to zero and then reintroducing them , rather than adopting the more common approach of investigating the effects of a pairing interaction separated from the rest of the interaction . this may be especially true in the shell model as the suggestion has been made by satula and wyss that it may not be appropriate to separate out a pairing interaction from the rest of the hamiltonian in a shell model context  @xcite .",
    "an examination of the t=0 two - body matrix elements in figure [ fig : newlast ] does not show any obvious simplicity .",
    "their distribution looks just as complex as those with t=1 shown in figure [ fig : finallast ] .",
    "if the t=0 diagonal matrix elements were all constant and the off - diagonal matrix elements were zero , we could represent the results by a two - body monopole interaction as @xmath28 .",
    "this would be an easy explanation of the insensitivity but certainly it would not be a correct one .    concerning the future of this subject , it would be of great interest to fill in the missing levels which have been shown in the tables .",
    "in particular we have noted that , although there is much data on even spins in the even  even nuclei , there is very little known about the odd @xmath13 positive parity states .",
    "figures [ fig : ti44odd ] to [ fig : cr50odd ] show some interesting band structure for odd @xmath13 states .",
    "if the levels are found , we can put more constraints on the effective nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction in this region .",
