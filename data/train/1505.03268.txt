    "preparation of a quantum system in a well defined state is an essential task in many branches of modern physics ranging from atomic and molecular physics  @xcite to quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "techniques for transferring population from a ground state @xmath0 to a state @xmath1 employ either rabi cycling or adiabatic passage ( ap )  @xcite . amongst these latter stirap is a three - level atom scheme where selective and faithful population transfer is achieved by operating with two resonant driving fields in @xmath2 configuration  @xcite .",
    "the advantage over rabi cycling is the dramatic reduction of sensitivity to fluctuations of the parameters , at the expenses of a longer duration of the adiabatic protocol . in more complex architectures semiclassical driving fields",
    "are substituted by harmonic modes of a strongly coupled cavity , and tasks as preparation of photons with controlled amplitude , frequency and polarization  @xcite can be performed by vacuum - stimulated raman ap ( vstirap ) .    in the last few years multilevel coherence in solid - state systems , from mesoscopic devices  @xcite to atomic - like impurity states",
    "@xcite , has been a fertile subject of investigation . in particular superconducting - based `` artificial atoms ''  @xcite",
    "are very promising since coherent phenomena proper of the microscopic realm have been demonstrated on the mesoscopic scale . with respect to their natural counterpart ,",
    "artificial atoms offer the advantage that composite structures can be fabricated on a single chip  @xcite , which allows manipulation of single photons at @xmath3 frequencies opening the new scenario of microwave quantum photonics  @xcite .",
    "moreover new architectures could be implemented with both larger couplings  @xcite and a larger degree of integration than their atomic counterparts .    in the last few years several theoretical proposals  @xcite and experiments  @xcite",
    "have dealt with multilevel coherence in artificial atoms .",
    "distinctive features of such systems are the effectiveness of parity selection rules  @xcite which together with the presence of strong @xmath4 noise  @xcite , impose constraints on the available control",
    ". therefore new protocols for manipulating the coherent dynamics must be tailored for such systems .",
    "their design requires that large couplings allowing for efficient control are combined with protection from noise  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a new protocol to achieve coherent population transfer between the two lowest excited states of a three - level atom by using two ac fields .",
    "the key difference with standard stirap , where ac fields must be switched on and off in a counterintuitive sequence  @xcite , is that one of the fields is kept always - on , its amplitude being constant during the protocol .",
    "operations require phase modulation , and for this reason we call the protocol cstirap ( chirped stirap ) .",
    "sweeping the frequency of a single classical driving field across the resonance is a standard way to switch on and off rabi oscillations , thereby one may think to rephrase stirap accordingly , but this is not the case .",
    "indeed coherent population requires destructive interference of the two fields  @xcite .",
    "this is guaranteed by cstirap , which thereby solves a non - trivial control problem , its experimental demonstration in artificial atoms being by itself an important proof of principle of advanced three - level control .",
    "even more interestingly , cstirap could apply to architectures where `` artificial atoms '' are coupled to quantized modes , electromagnetic or nanomechanical , where strong coupling is achieved by non - switchable hardware elements keeping the interaction always - on .",
    "the protocol we propose possesses certain advantageous distinctive characteristics : ( i ) it works with reduced available control , as always - on field , ( ii ) it operates with nearly resonant fields , reducing the operation time ; ( iii ) it may rely on better techniques to control the phase of microwave circuits , ( iv ) it is cyclic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : co - po - tra ] we introduce the model hamiltonian and briefly review standard implementations of coherent population transfer in two and three - level atoms . in sec .",

[ sec : decoherence ] decoherence effects . finally , in sec.[sec : conclusions ] , along with the conclusions , we will discuss the comparison of cstirap with other protocols for population transfer operated by frequency chirps .",
    "in two - level systems coherent population transfer @xmath5 by ap is performed by shining a direct coupling field whose detuning is swept through the resonance at the bohr frequency of the transition .",
    "common examples are rapid ap ( rap ) or stark chirped rap ( scrap )  @xcite .    in three - level systems population transfer may be achieved in absence of direct coupling , via a third _ linkage _ state @xmath6 , coupled to @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a pump field at frequency @xmath7 and a stokes field at @xmath8 , respectively . in particular the _ lambda configuration _ depicted in the top inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] will be considered in this work . since @xmath6 is usually short - lived ,",
    "one of the goals of coherent techniques is to use @xmath6 but _ never populate it_. this is achieved in a very efficient and elegant way relying on destructive interference  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation , in the basis of the bare states @xmath9 , is expressed in a doubly rotating frame as @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 are the rabi frequencies of the pump and the stokes fields , which are detuned by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "a key quantity is the two - photon detuning , defined as @xmath15 .",
    "conventional stirap relies on the fact that at two - photon resonance , @xmath16 , an instantaneous eigenvector with zero eigenvalue @xmath17 exists given by @xmath18 it is called _ dark state _ since population is confined in the `` trapped subspace '' @xmath19 , despite of the fact that the two fields excite both the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 transitions .",
    "the key phenomenon preventing population of @xmath6 is destructive interference between the amplitudes corresponding to the two absorption patterns  @xcite .",
    "conventional stirap consists in letting the dark state evolve adiabatically from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "this is achieved by shining pulses @xmath11 in a `` counterintuitive '' sequence , the stokes at first and then the pump .",
    "an important characteristic of stirap is the fact that ap is operated when both fields are on , determining a two - photon effective coupling @xmath24 .",
    "stirap has been observed in a variety of physical systems  @xcite .",
    "the two - photon character of population transfer , and the fact that the protocol is maximally efficient with fully resonant fields , @xmath25 is the key for interesting applications with quantized fields .",
    "another three - level technique , raman chirped adiabatic passage ( rcap )  @xcite , uses instead phase modulation .",
    "population transfer is achieved by two far off - resonance chirped laser pulse sweeping through resonance ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] ) . unlike conventional stirap ,",
    "two - photon resonance is not kept during the whole process , causing a transient population of state @xmath6 to appear .",
    "the latter in principle can be made small by accurate tuning of parameters .",
    "in this section we will address the problem of achieving @xmath26 population transfer subject to two constraints , namely ( a ) keeping the population of @xmath6 small and ( b )",
    "operating with a reduced control , in particular with one of the fields , for instance the stokes one , kept always on , @xmath27 .",
    "naively one could suppose that sweeping the detuning @xmath28 could allow to effectively switch on and off @xmath29 , allowing again for conventional stirap .",
    "however this is not the case because coherent population transfer requires that the two - photon resonance condition , @xmath30 , is kept while sweeping @xmath28 , to ensure destructive interference . in",
    "what follows we will seek for a solution allowing to achieve complete population transfer by properly shaping the detunings .",
    "first of all when one of the fields is always on , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) for @xmath31 is not diagonal in the bare state basis . in order to approximate asymptotically the desired target state @xmath1 , necessarily at the end of the protocol we must have @xmath32 .",

    "we discuss this issue , which is also responsible for decoherence due to low - frequency noise  @xcite .",
    "the physics is understood recalling the picture of conventional stirap , where two kind of errors emerge  @xcite .",
    "`` bad projection '' errors , due a bad choice of the pulse shape and timing , may lead to the wrong target state .",
    "`` bad adiabaticity '' errors induce leakage from the trapped subspace , nonadiabatic transitions surely occurring when the so called `` global condition '' @xmath83 is not met . both kinds of errors are also triggered by fluctuations induced by an environment ( see sec.[sec : decoherence ] ) .",
    "for cstirap we verified that large enough @xmath84 again guarantees adiabaticity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity - amplitude ] ) . in this regime",
    "a strong asset of cstirap is that it is not affected by bad projection errors in the far - detuned phases , since final eigenstates in the rotating frame are nondegenerate .",
    "however since the efficency of cstirap depends on the structure of crossings of the eigenvalues of the stokes hamiltonian , it may be affected by stray detunings during the protocol .",
    "a further drawback comes from the fact that the state carrying population in cstirap , while taking advantage from destructive interference , it is not an exact dark state as in eq.([eq : dark - state ] ) , since the condition @xmath36 does not hold true .",
    "this is a potentially important source of error for cstirap since it also may determine a nonvanising population of @xmath6 at intermediate times .",
    "sensitivity to detunings is conveniently studied by the non - hermitian hamiltonian : @xmath85 using a sufficiently large @xmath86 guarantees that transient population of @xmath6 decays elsewhere ( e.g. in a continuum ) , yielding a lack of normalization at the end of the protocol .",
    "therefore the resulting efficiency @xmath87 is a figure of merit embedding the requirement that @xmath6 should be never populated .    the hamiltonian ( [ eq : parametric - hamiltonian ] ) , where only the dependence on detunings is emphasized , accounts for the effect of stray components by letting @xmath88 stray detunings may describe very slow phase fluctuations ( at frequencies @xmath89 ) of the driving fields . physically in solid - state devices they describe energy fluctuations due to coupling to an environment ( see sec.[sec : decoherence ] and ref .  )",

    "it is seen that the efficiency is large in a whole region around the center of the plot ( absence of fluctuations , @xmath94 ) , showing the stability of the protocol .",
    "the failure of cstirap in the region of larger detunings is analyzed in the app .",
    "[ sec : failure - stirap ] .",
    "here we mention that in the first and in the third quadrants of fig .",
    "[ fig : sens_detunings ] failure is due to `` bad projection '' errors , i.e. the system may evolve along an adiabatic linkage leading to a wrong target state .",
    "instead deep in the second quadrant the problem is `` bad adiabaticity '' due to an insufficient pump - induced two - photon avoided crossing .    concerning sensitivity to @xmath102 , notice that the convenient delay is implicitly set by the choice of @xmath103 being maximal at the second crossing time , eq.([eq : pulse ] ) .",
    "we have checked that in these conditions the protocol is stable against deviations from the delay and the detailed pulse shape used in this work , provided they are not too large .",
    "moreover it is worth stressing that the protocol we propose in the `` ideal '' detunings case , while being physically satisfactory , is not an optimal solution in the mathematical sense .",
    "therefore we expect further improvement by tackling the problem with optimal control theory .",
    "a further important source of errors in stirap is decoherence  @xcite , especially in solid - state artificial atoms .",
    "we discuss some qualitative aspect in this section .",
    "a key asset of conventional stirap is that while spontaneous decay from @xmath6 may be large ( decay time larger than the duration of the protocol ) , the phenomenon is supposed to have small impact as long as @xmath6 is depopulated .",
    "this holds true also for cstirap , as seen from the results for @xmath104 presented in the last section .",
    "markovian dephasing in stirap has been studied in detail  @xcite and its detrimental effect , namely leakage from the trapped subspace due to the weakening of destructive interference phenomenon , has been elucidated .",
    "it has been shown that strong markovian dephasing is tolerated , as long as it does not affect the two levels of the trapped subspace .",
    "more complete studies of the effects of quantum noise in driven systems have pointed out that in solid state implementations of three - level artificial atoms the main effect is due to decay processes within the trapped subspace  @xcite .",
    "other decoherence channels emerging in the born - markov approximation , namely the relation of rates to the detailed spectral density of the environment  @xcite and the possible drive - induced absorption  @xcite , are less relevant .",
    "on the other hand , unlike their natural counterpart , artificial atoms implemented by solid - state nanodevices suffer from low - frequency noise  @xcite .",
    "this drawback may be compensated by the ease of producing large couplings on chip , the tradeoff between protection and addressability being the central design issue .",
    "the effect of low - frequency noise in stirap has been discussed in ref .  , where its interplay with markovian noise and the role of device design were also addressed  @xcite .",
    "the extension of this detailed analysis to cstirap is beyond the scope of this paper , but general features pointed out in the above works together with the results of the last section , allow to draw a physical picture which can be used as a guide for device design .",
    "we assume that low efficiency may be determined by by decoherence leading to detrapping from the @xmath19 subspace and by failures of the adiabatic approximation also leading to unwanted population of @xmath6 .",
    "the simplest model encompassing these main features is to account for decay of @xmath6 in a continuum due to quantum noise ( @xmath80 ) and to account for dephasing as due to low - frequency ( classical ) fluctuations of relevant parameters .",
    "that is we consider the hamiltonian eq.([eq : h ] ) supplemented by the non - hermitian term appearing in eq.([eq : parametric - hamiltonian ] ) , and let @xmath105 , for @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are classical stochastic processes . in artificial atoms",
    "such fluctuations stem physically from noisy external bias fields , which induce fluctuations of the energy splittings of the device ( determining @xmath110 s ) and of the operator coupling to the field ( yielding @xmath111 s ) . the efficiency is obtained by averaging over such fluctuations @xmath112 , at the end of the protocol . in cases of interest , as for @xmath4 noise , the average can be estimated in the quasistatic ( or static - path ) approximation  @xcite . it amounts to substitute stochastic processes by random variables with a suitable gaussian distribution , which physically accounts for sample to sample fluctuations of parameters .",
    "results of the last section suggest that stray @xmath111s hardly affect the efficiency , whereas the effect of the distribution of @xmath110 s can be important .",
    "this effect can be read off in fig.[fig : sens_detunings ] , which shows that for reasonably small fluctuations there is a region where still large efficiencies are allowed .",
    "successful cstirap requires that fluctuations of energy levels ( i.e. detunings ) are smaller than the linewidths . in analogy with the analysis of ref",
    "we expect that the condition of large efficiency depends on the bandstructure of the device at the bias point . indeed depending on the device and on the noise source , fluctuations of the two splittings ( detunings )",
    "are either correlated or anticorrelated  @xcite , namely they are described by lines with positive or negative slope in fig .",

    "this procedure is suited for applications in artificial atoms and can be advantageous in integrated atom - cavity systems architectures , where couplings to quantized modes are implemented by non - switchable hardware  @xcite , and may be manipulated in this way for applications to microwave quantum photonics  @xcite . in this respect",
    "it may be useful that cstirap can be repeated cyclically since population histories are invariant when @xmath115 , allowing the protocol to work as well in the reverted detunings configuration .",
    "the protocol leverages on the fact that in the microwave realm external fields have a phase which can be usually controlled better than for sources at optical frequencies . in particular frequency can be modulated more accurately allowing direct time - dependent control of the detunings , instead of the induced stark shifts used in genuine atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover in solid - state artificial atoms , e.g. superconductor based , detunings can be independently modulated by external voltages and fluxes .",
    "manipulation of detunings is the basis of other coherent transfer protocols like rcap  @xcite .",
    "the essential difference between standard rcap and cstirap is that , owing to the fact that the stokes field is always - on , our protocol involves a dressed state in the ap phase ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cstirap - mech ] ) , whereas in the former ap occurs between bare states .",
    "therefore while in rcap the avoided crossing is due to the two - photon coupling of two far detuned dispersively coupled fields , in cstirap ap takes place via destructively interfering _ resonant _ fields .",
    "this renders more robust the protocol , which achieves large efficiency for rather small pulse duration . on the other hand the analogy with rcap , as well as the discussion of sec .",
    "[ sec : decoherence ] , suggests that also cstirap may be resilient to phase noise and to low - frequency noise in nanocircuits offering advantages in quantum state processing with artificial atoms  @xcite .",
    "stirap is also the basis of other protocols as preparation of superpositions  @xcite , transfer of wavepackets  @xcite , manipulation of photons and quantum gates  @xcite , with still unexplored potentialities for quantum information and quantum control",
    ". therefore demonstration of cstirap is a benchmark for a class of multilevel advanced control protocols in artificial atoms .",
    "in order to estimate the population of @xmath6 we start from the usual adiabatic elimination in the bare basis .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath116 , with the hamiltonian eq.([eq : h ] ) , is written for the components of @xmath117 .",
    "assuming @xmath118 one finds @xmath119 this expression of @xmath120 is substituted in the schrdinger equation yielding a two - state problem governed by the effective hamiltonian @xmath121 now assuming the validity of the adiabatic approximation , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are approximately given by the instantaneous eigenvectors of @xmath124 .",
    "in particular we consider the state corresponding to the preparation @xmath125 , and we can estimate @xmath126 from eq .",

    "the analytic result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvalues](b ) , thin solid line in the inset , and it yields good agreement with the numerical curve . the analytic expression , though easy attainable , is cumbersome .",

    "( [ eq : p2-adel ] ) .    , @xmath129 and @xmath56 .",
    "[ fig : populationspao ] ]    we remind that adiabatic elimination yields coarse grained amplitudes and it is a priori enforced by large single - photon detunings .",
    "remarkably the result obtained from eq.([eq : c2 ] ) is accurate for the whole procedure , even if in part of the protocol the condition @xmath130 is not met .",
    "this is due to the fact that the population of @xmath6 is always small , either because the regime is dispersive or because there is destructive interference .",
    "corrections in the regime where @xmath131 can be fully taken into account if adiabatic elimination is carried in the representation of the stokes eigenstates .",
    "we write the hamiltonian eq.([eq : h ] ) in the basis @xmath132 , given by @xmath133 . by expressing @xmath134 and assuming @xmath135 , we obtain @xmath136 , where @xmath137^{-1/2}$ ] . substituting the ansatz for @xmath138 into the schrdinger equation yields an effective @xmath139 hamiltonian , which in the @xmath140 basis reads : @xmath141 which yields the leakage to @xmath6 in the form @xmath142 as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvalues](b ) ( dashed line ) the result reproduces the numerical solution , but it does not yield a figure of merit as simple as eq .  [",
    "eq : p2-adel ] .",
    "we can seek for a protocol dual to the always - on stokes field by making the following substitutions , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "the population histories are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : populationspao ] and differ somehow from those of sec.[sec : co - po - tra ] .",
    "the point is that the system is prepared in @xmath0 , which in this case is not an exact eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian . as a consequence rabi oscillations of small amplitude appear in both @xmath146 and @xmath57 .",
    "they can be substantially reduced by increasing the initial value of the pump detuning .",
    "stray population may appear in the intermediate state @xmath6 also due to adiabatic population transfer at the avoided crossing , and can be minimized by adjusting parameters as suggested by eq .",
    "[ eq : p2-adel ] .",
    "we now analyze the dynamics in the regions of fig .  [",
    "fig : sens_detunings ] where cstirap fails . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : cstirap - sens ] when energy levels have infinite lifetime , failure of the protocol is due to two kind of errors , namely `` bad adiabaticity '' and `` bad projection ''  @xcite . while in the former case",
    ", the protocol fails because the avoided crossing produced by the fields is insufficient to guarantee adiabaticity , in the latter case the system is projected onto the wrong eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "errors mainly occur during the ap near the point at @xmath50 where stokes eigenstates cross .",
    "an efficient protocol requires for the probabilities of landau - zener transitions between such states that @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which is not always met for finite stray detunings .    a qualitative picture of how cstirap possibly fails due to stray detunings is offered by the patterns of the instantaneous eigenvalues of the full and of the stokes hamiltonians , in the darker regions of the three ( a - c ) quadrants of fig .",
    "[ fig : sens_detunings ] . examples of these patterns are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens_detunings2](a - c ) .    in the region deep in quadrant ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : sens_detunings ] detunings are such that the first crossings of the stokes eigenenergies occurs _ at positive times _ , i.e. when @xmath61 is already on [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sens_detunings2](a ) ] . therefore @xmath0 and @xmath149 mix , originating a sort of initial `` bad projection '' error .",
    "then the subsequent swap @xmath150 leads to a wrong target state .",
    "deep in quadrant ( b ) , the protocol suffers from a sort of final `` bad projection '' error : the second crossing occurs _ at negative times _ , where @xmath151 and the correspondent transition becomes diabatic .",
    "this yields @xmath152 at all times  @xcite .",
    "deep in quadrant ( c ) cstirap fails when the configuration of detunings renders the pump - induced avoided crossing insufficient . in this case",
    "the problem is `` bad adiabaticity '' , zener tunneling inducing unwanted transitions to the state adiabatically evolving towards @xmath0 .",
    "finally , deep in the quadrant ( d ) the configuration of detunings is such that the two `` mixing '' phases of the protocol are inverted . indeed",
    "the stokes - induced at splitting becomes relevant only _ after _ the second crossing , which in the ideal case would have produced the two - photon ap .",
    "therefore @xmath61 partially injects population into @xmath6 . at later times , in the stokes - at phase , this population is swapped to @xmath1 .",
