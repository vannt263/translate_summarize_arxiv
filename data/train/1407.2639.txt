    "in this paper we consider pure states of the quantum system consisting of @xmath0 qubits . throughout",
    ", we assume that considered qubits are isolated .",
    "such setting can be realised as , for example , a set of dual - rail photons or two - level atoms . in the first case ,",
    "a qubit is encoded by a single photon occupying two orthogonal modes , while in the second case the role of a qubit is played by an electron in an atom with two non - degenerate energy levels . considering a number of isolated qubits means taking into account only the systems of noninteracting , distinguishable particles . continuing the examples above",
    ", a possible realization would be a set of two - mode noninteracting waveguides or a set of noninteracting atoms respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian evolution of such system is described by a group of local unitaries , @xmath1 , acting independently on each qubit , i.e. for @xmath2 @xmath3 in the above expression @xmath4 , as the hilbert space , @xmath5 , of the considered @xmath0-qubit system is equal to @xmath6 . moreover ,",
    "the only measurements which are available are restricted to the local one - qubit measurements and the allowed operations are , in general , the stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication ( slocc ) . in other words , the slocc operations are represented by the local linear operators . however , in our work we restrict ourselves to considering only invertible slocc operations , namely to the action of group @xmath7 .",
    "another consequence of the partition into @xmath0 distinguishable noninteracting parties is that one does not need to know exactly the state @xmath8 in order to calculate expectation values of the available local measurements .",
    "in fact , from a single qubit perspective , the necessary and sufficient information about @xmath8 is encoded in one - qubit reduced density matrices @xmath9 .",
    "the knowledge of the reduced one - qubit density matrices allows one to define the total variance of state @xmath10 @xcite , or equivalently the linear entropy at the state @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which we describe in more detail in the next section .",
    "the main importance of the linear entropy of the reduced matrices is that it can be used for quantifying entanglement in the system .",
    "the arguments for such an interpretation are the following .",
    "the linear entropy of a density matrix , @xmath12 , is also called the impurity of a state and is given by the formula @xmath13 . for a pure state @xmath14 and",
    "therefore the linear entropy is equal to zero .",
    "however , performing the reduction of a density matrix of a pure state by tracing over a subsystem usually results with a mixed state .",
    "the mixedness of the reduced density matrices of a pure state can arise only from the entanglement between the subsystems .",
    "therefore , one can conjecture that the linear entropy of the reduced density matrices can be in this case a good measure of the entanglement between the subsystems .",
    "such observations have been already made and used in various contexts , for example in investigating entanglement in multi - qubit - cavity systems @xcite , in two - fermion systems @xcite or in ions @xcite . in this paper , for the system of @xmath0 qubits , we aim to give a systematic and tractable method for finding critical points of the linear entropy . a critical point is a state at which the derivative of the linear entropy is equal to zero . moreover , if @xmath10 is such a critical point then the linear entropy restricted to the set @xmath15 attains its maximum value @xcite at @xmath10 .",
    "hence , by our interpretation of the linear entropy , such critical points are the locally maximally entangled states .",
    "as was shown in @xcite critical points of @xmath11 also play an essential role in the classification of states with respect to slocc operations as they parametrize quantum states that are asymptotically equivalent , i.e. can be transformed into one another by applying an infinite sequence of slocc operations . in @xcite",
    "one of us outlined the method which in principle allows finding critical points of @xmath16 for arbitrary system of both distinguishable and indistinguishable particles . to illustrate the method",
    "some low dimensional examples were calculated . here",
    "we substantially improve the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "our improvement is based on the general theory of the critical points of the momentum map as presented in @xcite . in particular",
    "it is based on the interplay between momentum maps for abelian and non - abelian groups .",
    "the general construction of the momentum map can be found , for example in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for considering the momentum map is the description of symmetries in a given system . for example , in a classic mechanical system whose hamiltonian is invariant under the group of translations , the momentum map is a map which assigns to a particle s trajectory its classical momentum .",
    "because the space of pure quantum states has the same properties as the classical phase space , namely both are symplectic manifolds , one can use the symmetry of preserving the norm of @xmath8 by the group of local unitaries in order to construct the momentum map .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : the - linear - entropy ] we review some useful facts concerning reduced one - qubit density matrices , linear entropy and its critical points . in particular",
    "we briefly describe the method proposed in @xcite . in section [ crit - mu ]",
    "we discuss the connection between the linear entropy and the momentum map .",
    "in particular we consider two momentum maps , for the action of local unitary group and its abelianization .",
    "then , in section 4 we describe the implementation for @xmath0 qubits .",
    "in this section we shortly review the relevant background informations concerning reduced one - qubit density matrices , the linear entropy and its critical points .",
    "let @xmath17 be the hilbert space of @xmath0-qubit system .",
    "recall that reduced one - qubit density matrices , @xmath18 , are the @xmath19 density matrices that satisfy    @xmath20    for an arbitrary set of @xmath19 hermitian matrices",
    "@xmath21 which represents an observable measured on the @xmath22-th qubit .",
    "in order to clarify the notion of a reduced matrix , let us also give an alternative , basis - dependent definition , incorporating the operation of the partial trace of a matrix .",
    "we will focus on a bipartite system , as the definition for arbitrary multipartite systems has a straightforward extension . if @xmath23 is a density matrix of a two partite system and @xmath24 is an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space of subsystem @xmath25 , then the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 in the case of more particles , in order to find one - particle reduced density matrices",
    ", one has to perform the above operation repeatedly with respect to each subsystem .",
    "such a reduced matrix can be interpreted as an averaged state of the chosen particle , where the average is taken over all remaining particles .",
    "let us next define two functions , which we will denote by @xmath28 and @xmath29 that act on a space of quantum states and return a set of @xmath19 traceless hermitian matrices . in a group theoretical language , maps @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "assign to a quantum state a set of elements of the lie algebra @xmath30 multiplied by the imaginary unit .",
    "the above mentioned hermitian matrices are the shifted one - qubit reduced density matrices , namely @xmath31 where each @xmath32 is a diagonal @xmath19 matrix whose diagonal elements are given by the increasingly ordered spectrum of @xmath33 .",
    "the map @xmath29 assigns to a state @xmath10 the collection of the shifted spectra of its ( shifted ) one - qubit reduced density matrices .",
    "let @xmath34 be the ordered spectrum of @xmath33 , that is , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the shifted spectrum , i.e. the spectrum of @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 . under these assumptions the image @xmath40 is known to be a convex polytope , defined by the set of polygonal inequalities @xcite    @xmath41    the images of @xmath29 in the case of two and three qubits are shown in figure [ fig : polytopes ]",
    "note that for @xmath42 inequalities ( [ nier1 ] ) imply that @xmath43 , which is a manifestation of a well known fact that for a two - partite system , the spectra of the one - particle reduced density matrices are identical .",
    "the line from @xmath44 to @xmath45 on figure [ fig : polytopes](a ) can be parametrized using the schmidt decomposition .",
    "namely , any two - qubit state can be can be written in a proper basis as @xmath46.\\ ] ] for such a state we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 , while @xmath49 . in the case of @xmath50 ,",
    "the polytope is three - dimensional and is spanned on @xmath51 vertices .     for ( a ) two and ( b ) three qubits .",
    "point @xmath44 is the image of @xmath52 or @xmath53 respectively , while points @xmath54 correspond to biseparable states . ]",
    "note also that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not sensitive to changes of the global phase and norm of state @xmath8 and as such are defined on the complex projective space @xmath55 rather than @xmath5 .",
    "the complex projective space is a set of equivalence classes of vectors @xmath56 , where all vectors belonging to the same complex line are identified . in other words , @xmath57 if and only if @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the notion of a complex projective space emerges in a natural way while considering quantum states , because a pure quantum state can be viewed as a representative of some equivalence class of relation @xmath60 .",
    "space @xmath55 has some important geometric properties , which we will use in the following sections .",
    "[ [ the - linear - entropy ] ] the linear entropy + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the following paragraph , we review some physical aspects of the linear entropy .",
    "one way to quantify entanglement of a pure multipartite state is to calculate the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrices .",
    "this is because the von neumann entropy of a quantum state is nonzero only if the considered state is mixed . on the other hand ,",
    "the only reason for a reduced density matrix of a pure state to be mixed is the presence of entanglement between the particles .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the sum of von neumann entropies of all reduced density matrices quantifies the amount of entanglement in the system .",
    "let us now return to the case of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath22th one - qubit reduced density matrix is given by @xmath61 , so the von neumann entropy is of the form @xmath62 approximating each of the logarithms by @xmath63 ( see figure [ fig : approximation ] for the plot of the approximation versus the original function ) and using the fact that @xmath64 , one obtains @xmath65    . ]    summing the approximations of the von neumann entropy for all one - qubit reduced density matrices and multiplying the result by factor @xmath66 , one gets the formula for the linear entropy of a state @xmath10 @xcite @xmath67 another way to interpret the linear entropy as a quantification of entanglement in a quantum system of many particles , is to consider quantum fluctuations as a manifestation of entanglement .",
    "indeed , the more entangled a quantum state is , the more inaccurate the results of measurements performed on this state are .",
    "this approach allows one to define the linear entropy as an accumulated variance of some set of observables , i.e. a quantity that can be _ a priori _ measured . to prove this statement ,",
    "let us define after klyachko @xcite the total variance of a pure state @xmath68 ^ 2\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is an orthonormal basis of the traceless local hermitian operators acting on @xmath5 .",
    "note that the space of ( traceless ) local hermitian operators is in our setting equal to the lie algebra of group k , modulo the multiplication by the imaginary unit , therefore their dimensions are the same .",
    "an exemplary basis of such a hermitian operators can be constructed from the pauli matrices , @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 using formula ( [ eq : reduced_def ] ) , one has that @xmath74 ^ 2=\\left(\\tr[\\rho(\\phi)\\mathcal{x}_{k}]\\right)^2=\\left(\\tr[\\rho_k(\\phi)\\sigma_x]\\right)^2.\\ ] ] on the other hand , every @xmath75 can be written as a linear combination of pauli matrices , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",

    "the state @xmath10 is a critical point of @xmath85 if and only if the differential of @xmath86 vanishes at @xmath10 , @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , function @xmath85 restricted to the @xmath88-orbit through a critical point , attains its maximum value at this point @xcite . in order to characterize the critical points of @xmath86 we define the local operators constructed from @xmath18    @xmath89    as was shown in @xcite",

    "when we act with local unitaries , @xmath96 , on a state @xmath10 , each one - qubit reduced density matrix transforms as follows @xmath97 matrices from @xmath98 can be chosen to diagonalize each @xmath99 , hence each @xmath92-orbit in @xmath55 corresponds to one point in the polytope @xmath100 .",
    "thus the critical reduced one - qubit density matrices correspond to some subset of points in @xmath100 .",
    "in fact , this subset contains a finite number of points @xcite .",
