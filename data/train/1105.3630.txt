    "observations of galaxy clusters with sufficiently large masses , at sufficiently large redshifts , can provide strong constraints on possible deviations from the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model with gaussian primordial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "even the observation of a _ single _ , sufficiently ` big ' and ` early ' cluster could rule out the standard model with a high level of confidence  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a number of clusters have recently been measured to have masses and redshifts @xcite that do , even individually , seem to create tension with the combination of @xmath0cdm and gaussian initial perturbations  @xcite . when attempts have been made to quantitatively measure the degree to which these clusters are collectively `` too big , too early '' large discrepancies between @xmath0cdm and the clusters have been claimed  @xcite .",
    "more of these high mass and high redshift clusters have subsequently been detected by the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite and many more will be detected in the near future by spt , the planck satellite , the dark energy survey and the xmm cluster survey ( xcs )  @xcite .",
    "the formation of extreme galaxy clusters depends on both the size of the primordial density perturbations and how long these perturbations have had to grow . in the simplest theoretical models , clusters form when @xmath1 , which is the fractional density contrast , @xmath2 , averaged over an approximately spherical region of space with radius @xmath3 , crosses a particular threshold . due to the assumption of statistical homogenity , at a given time ,",
    "every point in space has the same probability distibution for @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath2 is averaged over larger volumes , the fluctuations in @xmath4 become smaller .",
    "this means that regions with large radii are less likely to collapse than regions with small radii .",
    "unfortunately , after collapse it is not possible to directly measure the radius of the region that collapsed to form a cluster . nevertheless , according to theory , every cluster forms when @xmath1 crosses one definite threshold",
    "this necessitates that a cluster with a larger mass came from a larger region of space .",
    "therefore , it is expected that fewer clusters will form at larger masses .",
    "fewer clusters are also expected to form at higher redshifts simply because the initial density contrast has had less time to grow .",
    "therefore , the masses and redshifts of observed clusters are good parameters for quantifying the rareness of extreme galaxy clusters . as a result",
    ", if it could be shown that the most extreme clusters did form `` too big , too early '' , or even `` too little , too late '' , it would be possible to conclude that either the primordial perturbations do not have a gaussian spectrum with scale dependence given by a simple power or that the calibration between time and redshift is wrong and therefore clusters did not form as early as is inferred from @xmath0cdm",
    ".    it would seem that a very natural method to quantify the rareness of an extreme galaxy cluster is to ask `` what is the probability of observing at least one cluster at this mass and redshift or above ( @xmath5 ) ? ''",
    "once uncertainties in mass measurements , selection functions and cosmological parameters are properly marginalised over this question can then be converted into a measure of the probability that at least one cluster this rare could be _ observed_. it is this resulting measure that has been used to claim that the existence of certain clusters provides tension with @xmath0cdm and a gaussian , power law , spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "this measure is biased . when rareness is measured without bias",
    "it is seen that , in @xmath0cdm , there is a greater than 50% probability that the rarest currently observed cluster could exist somewhere in the fraction of sky observed .",
    "similarly , when the combined rareness of a set of clusters is calculated correctly , it is seen that there is a greater than 20% probability that even the entire set of rarest observed clusters could exist .",
    "nevertheless it is still true that quantifying the rareness of extreme galaxy clusters might provide useful information about possible new physics as will be explored in section [ sec : nogauss ] .",
    "the core of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec:>m > z ]",
    ", i will discuss the @xmath5 measure of rareness .",
    "i will discuss why to expect that this measure will give biased results .",
    "following this , in section [ sec:>m > zsim ] , i will show explicitly that it does lead to biased results when applied to sample cluster populations that were generated assuming a @xmath0cdm universe . in section [ sec : nbsingclust ]",
    ", i will show how to alter this measure to remove the bias .",
    "i will also present other well motivated measures to quantify the rareness of individual clusters .",
    "different measures will be more useful depending on what specific deviations from @xmath0cdm are being tested . in section [ sec : manyclust ] , i will introduce measures that combine the individual rarenesses of a set of clusters to quantify the total rareness of the set as a whole . in both section [ sec : nbsingclust ] and section [ sec : manyclust ] , i will apply the introduced measures of rareness to sets of observed galaxy clusters .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : nogauss ] , i will apply these rareness measures to sample cluster populations generated from non - gaussian primordial perturbations .",
    "[ sec : exp ]    before moving on to the core of the paper i will briefly outline the methodology used to calculate the expected number of clusters in a given region of mass and redshift over a given fraction of the sky , @xmath7 . for each measure of rareness",
    "i will be calculating the probabilities of clusters existing assuming a poissonian distribution ; therefore only the expected number is needed .",
    "this quantity is given by the following integral @xmath8 where the @xmath9 and @xmath10 integrals are over the region of the @xmath6 plane being considered , @xmath11 is the number density of galaxy clusters ( the halo mass function ) and @xmath12 is the volume element , @xmath13 ^ 2.\\ ] ] it is customary to reparameterise @xmath11 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the _ present _ density of matter in the universe and @xmath16  is the variance of the density contrast smoothed over the comoving scale , @xmath3 , that corresponds to the mass , @xmath10 .",
    "the function @xmath17 ( often also called the mass function , a convention i will follow in this work ) must then either be calculated theoretically or by matching to simulations .",
    "the form of @xmath17 depends on the shape of the primordial spectrum . for most of this work",
    "i will be assuming that the primordial spectrum is gaussian and will use the tinker et al .",

    ". i will calculate @xmath23 using the fit to the transfer function presented in @xcite with the modified shape parameter introduced in @xcite .",
    "the redshift dependence of @xmath16 is then obtained by multiplying @xmath23 by the linear growth function normalised to be proportional to @xmath24 during the era of matter domination .",
    "unless otherwise stated i will also use the wmap 7 cosmology maximum likelihood ( ml ) parameters  @xcite . using",
    "a different set of cosmological parameters ( specifically @xmath25 ) would change the exact numbers quoted in parts of this paper but would not alter any of the conclusions drawn from these numbers .      in this work",
    "i will be introducing a number of different measures to quantify cluster rareness . in each case",
    ", the quoted measure is to be interpreted as the probability that at least one cluster ( or set of clusters ) could exist that is at least as rare as the measured cluster ( or set ) . for reference",
    ", i will quickly summarise the notation convention i have used . for every measure i use @xmath3 as the base for an unbiased measure and @xmath26 for a biased measure .",
    "for individual cluster rareness , each measure corresponds to a prescription for defining unique contours in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "i have chosen to depict the contour used for each measure with subscript text .",
    "for example , for the biased version of the @xmath5 measure of rareness i write @xmath27 .",
    "i also introduce a number of ways to combine the individual rarenesses of a set of clusters .",
    "i have chosen to distinguish each method with superscript text .",
    "for example , for the method used by hoyle et al .",
    "in ref.@xcite i write @xmath28 . to depict the number of clusters used in a combined measure i put this number in subscript immediately before the contour definition . in principle , for a set of clusters , it is possible to combine any contour definition with any method for combining the individual cluster rarenesses .",
    "to quantify the rareness of a cluster using the @xmath5 measure it is necessary to first calculate the number of clusters expected above the mass and redshift of the observed cluster .",
    "this expected number is then converted into the probability that at least one cluster at least as rare as the observed cluster could exist , @xmath29 , by assuming poissonian statistics .",
    "if this probability is small , the cluster is deemed to be rare and tension can be claimed with @xmath0cdm .",
    "the bias in this measure can be seen in the following way . using the definition",
    "given it is possible to define a value of @xmath27  at every point in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "it is then possible to construct contours of equal @xmath27  in the plane .",
    "the number of clusters expected above each contour of constant @xmath27  is _ necessarily larger _ than the expected number of clusters used to calculate @xmath27 .",
    "this is because , for every point in the plane , @xmath27   is calculated using _ only _ the expected number of clusters at greater masses _ and _ greater redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , there will be points at lower masses and greater redshifts ( and vice versa ) that lie on the same @xmath27  contour .",
    "these points would not be included in the integration region used to define @xmath27  at any other point on the contour , but are defined to be equally rare .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath30 , the probability that some cluster exists with @xmath31 is _ necessarily greater _ than @xmath32 itself .",
    "this is the bias .",
    "this argument is illustrated in figure [ fig : grmgrz ] .    .",
    "every point on the curve has the same number of clusters expected at greater masses and redshifts ( i.e. the same @xmath30 ) .",
    "the probability that a cluster will exist with @xmath31 is equal to the probability that a cluster will exist above this entire curve .",
    "this probability is necessarily greater than @xmath32 . ]",
    "[ fig : grmgrz ]      in refs.@xcite the idea of a contour of constant @xmath27  is used explicitly .",
    "ref.@xcite provides fitting formulae for the contours as a function of the exclusion limit required to rule out @xmath0cdm .",
    "but , for a given exclusion limit of @xmath33 , if _ any _ cluster detected above the corresponding contour is to be interpreted as ruling out @xmath0cdm with @xmath34 confidence , then the probability of observing such a cluster can not be greater than @xmath35 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mortplot ] i have tested this .",
    "ref.@xcite makes a distinction between @xmath36 , the proportion of wmap 7 parameter space ruled out , and @xmath37 , the probability to have zero clusters @xmath5 in a random sample of the same sky fraction .",
    "i have always taken @xmath38 and have used this as the x - axis of figure [ fig : mortplot ] .",
    "the y - axis gives the probability of at least one cluster existing in a specified region of the @xmath6 plane , using a specified set of cosmological parameters .",
    "the three different lines correspond to particular regions and particular cosmological parameters .",
    "for each line i have taken @xmath39 .",
    "the solid red line uses the region of @xmath6 defined as @xmath5 of any arbitrary point on the corresponding contour ( by definition all points on the same contour return the same result ) .",
    "ref.@xcite states that , for a contour with a given @xmath36 , in @xmath40 of allowed cosmological parameter space the expected number of clusters is less than the expected number that would give the required statistical exclusion limit , @xmath37 .",
    "the expected number of clusters depends sensitively and monotonically on @xmath25 but very weakly on all other cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore , for the solid red line i calculate the expected number of clusters @xmath5 using @xmath41 defined by @xmath42 following ref.@xcite , the distribution for @xmath25 was taken from combined cmb , sn , bao and @xmath43 constraints .",
    "the red line matches well to expectations indicating that i am correctly interpreting ref@xcite .",

    "the dotted line makes it possible to estimate the true conservative significance that should be claimed by the observation of a cluster on or above a particular @xmath44 contour . when the dotted line gives a probability of 0.1 , the x - axis value is @xmath45 . therefore ,",

    "this set is not exhaustive of all possible measures .",
    "in fact , any prescription that defines a unique set of @xmath44 contours in the @xmath6 plane will define a corresponding measure of rareness .",
    "for example , asking what the probability is that a given cluster is the most massive cluster in a survey window would be another possible rareness measure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "i have argued that @xmath78 will be the measure that is most susceptible to deviations from @xmath0cdm arising through changes in the primordial sepctrum of density perturbations and that @xmath79 will be most susceptible to deviations in the expansion history and growth function of the primordial perturbations .",
    "i have presented methods to combine the individual rarenesses of a set of clusters into a combined measure of the ` rareness ' of the set .",
    "@xmath80 , first used in hoyle et al.@xcite , simply multiplies together the individual rarenesses of @xmath68 clusters .",
    "this method of combining rarenesses introduces its own bias ; however the bias can be straightforwardly accounted for by comparing to sample populations .",
    "the most signficant flaw in @xmath81 is that it is more sensitive to the rareness of the most extreme cluster , than it is to any other cluster in a set .",
    "@xmath82 , first used in mortonson et al.@xcite , instead quantifies the probability that the @xmath83 rarest cluster in the universe could be as rare as the @xmath83 rarest in a given set .",
    "@xmath69 can then be calculated at each value of @xmath68 to look for possible deviations from @xmath0cdm .",
    "however , it could occur that @xmath69 is small for all @xmath68 , but never small enough to claim significant tension , or @xmath69 could be significantly small for some values of @xmath68 , but not for others .",
    "@xmath67 , first presented here , quantifies the combined rareness of all of the @xmath68 rarest clusters .",
    "i have presented formulae for a biased value of @xmath67 ( i.e. @xmath84 ) for @xmath85 and a computationally efficient method to account for this bias ( without the need to generate sample cluster populations ) .",

    "there is also a greater than @xmath87 probability that a set of clusters as rare as either h10 or w11 could exist in @xmath0cdm .",
    "these constraints are conservative and could be improved by accounting for the selection function of each sample and reducing the mass uncertainties . for the most extreme clusters in each sample",
    "i have also listed the `` equivalent mass at redshift zero '' , which is the mass of a cluster at @xmath88 that would be judged to be equally rare .",
    "while some of the clusters would be quite large at @xmath88 they would not be without precedent .    as a working example i applied the rareness measures",
    "to sample cluster populations generated using a non - gaussian primordial spectrum .",
    "for very large non - gaussianity , even the four rarest clusters could in principle rule out the standard cosmological model with high significance . for more realistic levels of non - gaussianity",
    ", a small number of the most extreme clusters will not be able to provide significant tension .",
    "note however that my analysis has used the non - gaussianity parameter , @xmath64 .",
    "it is expected that the abundance of extreme clusters ( and voids ) will be relatively more susceptible to higher order non - gaussianity parameters ( e.g. @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) than @xmath64  ( see for example refs.@xcite ) .    in ref.@xcite convenient fitting formulae",
    "were provided for @xmath44 contours as a function of @xmath7  and the exclusion limit with which one desires to rule out @xmath0cdm ( using @xmath27 ) .",
    "unfortunately , generalising these contours to unbiased measures of rareness is not straightforward .",
    "the major problem is that the region that it is necessary to integrate over in the @xmath6 plane to unbiasedly quantify rareness is experiment dependent .",
    "if an experiment can not see clusters below a certain mass threshold , a cluster observed by this experiment should not be claimed to be ` likely ' because equivalently rare clusters might exist below this threshold .",
    "a very conservative set of fitting formulae could be developed by assuming that an experiment _ can _ see everything in the @xmath6 plane ; however this would probably be so conservative that it would effectively be impotent . therefore",
    ", any accurate fitting formulae would also need to depend on observational cuts made in the @xmath6 plane .    when calculating the rareness of observed galaxy clusters my aim was to show that previously claimed sources of tension were a result of the use of the biased measure @xmath27 .",
    "sometimes , because @xmath27  was so small , the previous works in the literature made _ very _ conservative assumptions elsewhere in their analysis .",
    "i have also made these conservative assumptions .",
    "it is possible that a less conservative analysis of the rareness of observed galaxy clusters could still show significant tension with @xmath0cdm .",
    "this is especially true of the set of clusters in h10 ( in constructing their table , h10 excluded clusters without a spectroscopic redshift measurement , deliberately chose mass estimates that had large errors , were conservative in their choice of @xmath7  and neglected any selection function effects ) .",
    "however , to avoid accidentally making false claims of tension , any future analysis will need to either account for the bias in @xmath27 , use one of the naturally unbiased measures presented here , or , choose a new , well motivated , prescription for a set of equal rareness contours in the @xmath6 plane .      during the preparation of this manuscript , ref.@xcite was posted to the arxiv . in ref.@xcite ,",
