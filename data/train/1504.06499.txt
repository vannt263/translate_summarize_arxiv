    "in projective differential geometry , local properties of a surface in @xmath2-space was intensively investigated by darboux and others from the end of the 19th century to the early 20th century , while some new interests and ideas have recently been brought from singularity theory , generic differential geometry and applied mathematics such as computer - vison @xcite ; for example , geometric features of a multi - parameter family of surfaces in @xmath2-space are of particular interest in application @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we deal with a classification of jets of surfaces in @xmath0 via projective transformations , which gives a new insight of the classical subject from a singularity theoretic approach .",
    "we mainly work over @xmath3 . throughout this paper",
    ", we identify @xmath4 with an open chart of the projective space , @xmath5\\ } \\subset { \\mathbb{p}}^3 $ ] , and consider germs of surfaces in @xmath4 at the origin given by monge forms @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we say that two germs or jets of surfaces are _ projectively equivalent _ if there is a projective transformation on @xmath0 sending one to the other .",
    "a classically well - known fact is that at a general hyperbolic point of a surface , the jet of the monge form is projectively equivalent to @xmath9 where moduli parameters @xmath10 are primary projective differential invariants ( those should be compared with the gaussian / mean curvatures in the euclidean case and the pick invariant in the equi - affine case , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . our aim is to present this kind of expression for degenerate monge forms .",
    "most interesting is the parabolic case .",
    "projective transformations preserving the origin and the @xmath11-plane form a @xmath12-dimensional subgroup of @xmath13 , and it acts on the space of jets of monge forms .",
    "we then give an invariant stratification of the jet space of monge forms in accordance with singularity types of central projections , and describe the normal form of each stratum up to codimension @xmath14 .",
    "this is a natural extension of results of platonova @xcite and landis @xcite ( see also @xcite ) on the classification of jets of monge forms for a _ generic _ surface , which corresponds to the case of codimension @xmath15 in our list .",
    "our main theorem is stated as follows :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath16 be a closed surface and @xmath17 an open neighborhood of the origin in @xmath18 ( parameter space ) .",
    "there is a residual subset @xmath19 of the space of @xmath20-parameter families of smooth embeddings @xmath21 equipped with @xmath22-topology so that each @xmath23 satisfies that for arbitrary point @xmath24 the @xmath25-jet of monge form of the surface @xmath26 at @xmath27 is projectively equivalent to one of the normal forms at the origin given in tables [ main_table1 ] , [ main_table2 ] , [ main_table3 ] with codimension @xmath28 .    in tables",
    ", @xmath29 are moduli parameters and @xmath30 denotes arbitrary homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath31 . in our stratification , each stratum is determined by its _ projection type _",
    "( i.e. singularity type of projection along the asymptotic line ) , that is explained in the next  1.2 and  2.2 .",
    "this characterization is quite relevant ",
    "e.g. classes @xmath32 can not be distinguished by using types of height functions , the parabolic curves and asymptotic curves , but can be so by the difference of singularity types of projection from a special isolated viewpoint . the same approach to the classification of surfaces in @xmath33",
    "is considered in @xcite .",
    "@xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    in the case over @xmath37 , the elliptic case and the sign difference in tables are omitted .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] can be restated in the algebro - geometric context by mean of a beltini - type theorem for the linear system of projective surfaces of degree greater than @xmath25 .    in the normal forms listed in tables ,",
    "continuous moduli parameters @xmath29 and higher coefficients must be projective differential invariants in the sense of sophus lie ; in fact , there is a similarity between our arguments and those in a modern theory of differential invariants due to olver @xcite .",
    "besides , those leading parameters may have some particular geometric meanings .",
    "for instance , at a cusp of gauss ( that is a point of type @xmath38 on the surface ) , the coefficient @xmath39 of @xmath40 in the normal form coincides with the uribe - vargas cross - ratio invariant defined in @xcite .",
    "further , we will see that the coefficient of @xmath41 in the same monge form corresponds to the position of a special viewpoint lying on the asymptotic line (  2.2 ) .",
    "also we discuss in the final section  4 a partial connection between our monge forms and a topological classification of differential equations ( bde ) defining nets of asymptotic curves (  1.3 ) ; indeed @xmath29 are related to initial moduli parameters of the bde .",
    "in singularity theory , map - germs are classified up to diffeomorphism - germs of source and target , that is called the _ @xmath42-equivalence of map - germs _ ; we denote by @xmath43 for @xmath42-equivalent map - germs @xmath44 and @xmath45 . given a surface @xmath46 , the restriction of linear projection @xmath47 from arbitrary viewpoint @xmath25 not lying on @xmath16",
    "is called the _ central projection _ ; for each point @xmath48 , it locally presents a map - germ @xmath49 by taking local coordinates centered at @xmath50 and @xmath51 of source and target , respectively . obviously ,",
    "if two germs of surfaces are projectively equivalent , then they admit the same @xmath42-types of projections from arbitrary viewpoints . as a generalization of arnold - platonova s result @xcite , kabata studied in @xcite central projections of _ generic families _ of surfaces in the context of @xmath42-classification theory of plane - to - plane germs @xcite . in particular , he showed that all @xmath42-types of @xmath42-codimension @xmath52 appear in central projections of generic @xmath20-parameter families of surfaces - types no.@xmath53 ( in rieger s notation ) of codimension @xmath54 do not appear in central projections for a generic @xmath55-parameter family of surfaces .",
    "that is an extension of the fact proven in @xcite that @xmath42-types no.@xmath56 of codimension @xmath57 do not appear in central projections for a generic surface . ] .",
    "we then use part of kabata s result and classify jets of degenerate monge forms up to projective transformations . in particular , platonova s degenerate classes @xmath58 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) break into much finer classes in jet spaces of higher order .",
    "typical singularities are of fold and cusp types , whose normal forms are given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "more complicated @xmath42-types of plane - to - plane map - germs are classified by rieger @xcite .",
    "we follow his notations ; @xmath42-types with codimension @xmath52 are named by @xmath61 as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ( p.352 ) ) .",
    "some @xmath42-types are combined into a single topological-@xmath42-type , that was studied in detail in @xcite ; they are characterized by some _ specified @xmath25-jets _ listed in table [ riegerlist_top ] below , and called _ equisingularity types _",
    "@xmath62 ( see @xcite ) . for our convenience , provisionally we add two types of @xmath14-jets with codimension greater than @xmath54 , which are adjacent to @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) : @xmath65    @xmath66    the projection type in tables means the @xmath42-type of the central projection from _ arbitrary _ viewpoint lying on the asymptotic line . here _ the entire monge form is assumed to have appropriately generic higher terms of order @xmath67 added to the prescribed normal forms of @xmath25-jet in tables .",
    "_    for instance , look at the class @xmath38 ; the stratum has codimension @xmath20 in the jet space , thus the class appears at some isolated point on a generic surface , that is classically called an ( ordinary ) _ cusp of gauss _ point . in table",
    "[ main_table1 ] the corresponding projection type is written as  @xmath68 \" .",
    "that means that the central projection from almost all viewpoints lying on the asymptotic line has the gulls singularity @xmath69 , while the projection from some exceptional isolated viewpoint is of type @xmath70 worse than gulls type .",
    "if @xmath71 , we have the degenerate class @xmath72 ; it has codimension @xmath2 , so it appears generically in @xmath55-parameter family of surfaces with the projection type @xmath73 . in case that @xmath74 , there are two degenerate classes @xmath75 and @xmath76 according to whether the term @xmath41 in the @xmath57-jet remains or not .",
    "the latter type appears generically in a @xmath20-parameter family of surfaces , and the projection from any viewpoints on the asymptotic line is of type @xmath70 or worse .",
    "see  2.2 for the detail .      at each hyperbolic point of a surface in @xmath0 , there are exactly two asymptotic lines ( lines tangent to the surface with more than @xmath20-point contact ) ; they are invariants under projective transformations . the integral curves , called _ asymptotic curves _ , form a pair of foliations on the hyperbolic domain , which is classically named by the _ net of asymptotic curves_. the _ parabolic curve _ is the locus of singular points of asymptotic curves , and in fact it is the locus of points on the surface whose monge form is of type @xmath77 or more degenerate ones .",
    "the _ flecnodal curve _ is the locus of inflection points of asymptotic curves ; it is actually the closure of the locus of class @xmath78 .",
    "the parabolic and flecnodal curves meet each other tangentially at a cusp of gauss , i.e. a point of class @xmath79 .",
    "the net of asymptotic curves is defined by a _ binary differential equation _ ( bde ) . in a general",
    "setting , davydov @xcite and bruce - tari @xcite has presented the topological classification of ( families of ) bde .",
    "we then compare our classification of parabolic monge forms with degenerate parabolic points arising in the general classification of bde ( propositions [ bde0 ] , [ bde1 ] , [ bde2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will see that the flat umbilic class @xmath80 corresponds to a type of generic @xmath2-parameter family of bde studied in oliver @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also compare our classification of hyperbolic monge forms with bifurcations of flecnodal curves . in part of his dissertation @xcite uribe - vargas presented a complete list of generic @xmath55-parameter bifurcations of flecnodal curves via a geometric approach using the dual surfaces .",
    "we give a precise characterization of moduli parameters in our corresponding monge form for each type of uribe - vargas classification .",

    "thus , we conclude that morse bifurcations of flecnodal curves occur at a point of the class @xmath194 with @xmath71 and generic homogeneous terms of order @xmath57 ( those are regarded as normal forms for ` lips ' and ` bec -  - bec ' in @xcite ) .",
