    "potency of various states to violate bis @xcite , apart from its fundamental consequences , distinguishes them as forms of a resource directly usable in quantum information processing . not only",
    "can the violation ensure us about the security of a scheme of a cryptographic key generation @xcite , but also it can provide communication advantage in distributed computing @xcite , or increase security of secret sharing protocols @xcite .",
    "it is hence an interesting and important question to investigate , in which situations such a violation can occur .",
    "the investigation can go along two lines : first , we can ask if a given quantum state can provide statistics , which are in conflict with local hidden variable models .",
    "it is known , for example , that all pure states lead to a violation of a single family of inequalities based on the hardy paradox @xcite , or that less entangled states tend to be more robust against white noise than strongly correlated ones @xcite .",
    "the second approach turns out to be more systematic .",
    "pitovski and svozil @xcite has shown that the set of local hidden variable ( lhv ) models can be seen as polytope living in a higher - dimensional space .",
    "then bis can be seen as defining hyperplanes in this space such that the polytope is not intersected . a special class of the inequalities",
    "is called the class of tight bis , i.e. those , which define facets of the polytope .",
    "one can now focus on finding the tight inequalities from combining different lhv models .",
    "this method has led to the discovery of families of bis for arbitrarily many qubits for full correlations with two @xcite , or more @xcite settings per side , and for subcorrelations @xcite .",
    "many individual tight inequalities from outside these families - without clear generalizations to more complex experimental situations have been proposed ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , also for higher - dimensional subsystems ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    however , finding bis , which are not tight , is also an interesting important problem . defining the facets of the lhv models",
    "polytope is a very resource - consuming problem . up to date",
    ", all tight inequalities only for the most basic bell scenarios have been found numerically .",
    "assume that our system is a collection of @xmath0 qubits , and each observer can choose between @xmath1 settings .",
    "this means that the dimension of the space we work in is @xmath2 , and there are @xmath3 vertices .",
    "we need to find groups of @xmath2 linearly independent points , such that all other points lie on or on one side of their common hyperplane .",
    "since this task soon becomes too complex to solve , it is a convenient solution to find a non - tight inequality , which will give us some estimate on the tight ones .",
    "a perfect example are bell expressions utilizing all possible measurement settings in a certain plane @xcite ( known as geometric bis ) .",
    "it is easy to show that they can provide stronger robustness against white noise @xcite than standard werner - wolf - weinfurter - ukowski - brukner ( wwwb ) @xcite expressions , even though they are not tight .",
    "moreover , it suffices to give each observer a choice between three settings to beat the original robustness threshold @xcite .",
    "this indicates that already for four qubits and three settings there exist a tight inequality with a higher threshold than known today .",
    "recently , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) paradox @xcite have been formulated for some combinations of number of particles @xmath0 and dimensionality of all subsystems @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "also , the first generalization of geometrical bis for qutrits have been shown in ref .",
    "thus , it is interesting to investigate how the inequalities can be constructed for collections of large quantum systems .",
    "we aim in investigating different strategies to construct such inequalities , which , for the sake of fairness of comparison , will be tested in the same bell scenario .",
    "one will be taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , which involves assigning real numbers to local measurement outcomes , which are then multiplied .",
    "then , we will replace real numbers with complex ones .",
    "in other strategies , we give local detectors labels 0 to @xmath5 , and sum the labels of detectors that have supposedly clicked modulo @xmath4 .",
    "this sum is then translated to either dichotomic scalar or a @xmath6-dimensional vector .",
    "consider a real vector @xmath7 and a set of real vectors @xmath8 .",
    "any element of @xmath8 will be denoted as @xmath9 .",
    "if the norm of @xmath7 exceeds the scalar product with all elements of @xmath8 , then it can not belong to this set , i.e. , @xmath7 can not be represented as a convex combination of elements of @xmath8 : @xmath10 note , however , that the converse statement is not true in general .    as the vector @xmath7",
    "we take the quantum correlation function , and @xmath8 will be a set of local realistic models , assigning outcomes to all possible measurements .",
    "the components of these vectors are indexed by measurement settings , thus in a two - party system with @xmath11 measurement setting for one observer and @xmath12 for the other , we have @xmath13-dimensional vectors . here",
    ", we will exploit the principle known for qutrits as the 1 - 0 - 1 rule @xcite .",
    "it states that in any given basis , every possible outcome should be assigned to some detector , and this assignment should be consistent for all instances this basis appears at",
    ". we will be interested in such orbits of observables , which involves commuting observables , but with changed ( permuted ) eigenvalues .    given the dimensionality of each subsystem @xmath4 , the permutation of these vectors is easily realized by the following transformation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fourier transform , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "notice that @xmath18 realizes cyclic permutations for @xmath19 with integers @xmath20 .",
    "we first consider the case of traditional von neumann measurements where the outcomes are simply scalars and the correlation function @xmath21 is the expectation value of the local outcomes .",
    "we study these observables , for which one - dimensional subspace is distinguished from the rest by an eigenvalue : @xmath22 let us remark that all strategies will involve outcomes , which sum up to 0 .",
    "only then can we associate the ratio between the quantum and the maximum local realistic value with a strength of violation and robustness against the white noise .",
    "the state under the consideration is the ghz state of @xmath0 qu@xmath4its , @xmath23 now , let us consider the fixed part of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which has the following matrix representation : @xmath26 because the ghz state is correlated in the computational basis ( all qu@xmath4its always yield the same outcome of a measurement in this basis ) , the correlation function can be written as @xmath27    on the other hand , a local realistic model implies that the local outcomes are predetermined before measurements , i.e. , the model freely assigns values @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the only requirement is that once setting @xmath30 has been ascribed value @xmath31 , we demand that settings @xmath32 is assigned to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the settings used by each observer are @xmath35 , with @xmath1 being the number of settings ( i.e. , different bases ) for each observer .",
    "the variables @xmath36 enumerates a basis @xmath37th observer measures in , and @xmath38 encodes his labelling of detectors .",
    "an exceptional case is of @xmath0 even , when the first observer uses settings @xmath39/d$ ] .",
    "the locally realistic correlation function @xmath40 is then simply a product of values assigned to specific settings .",
    "tables [ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] and [ tab2a ] give some values of @xmath41 , minimized over all local realistic models for some combinations of @xmath42 , and @xmath1 .",
    "a few remarks ought to be made on these results .",
    "first is that , similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , in table [ tab2 ] , we observe a sort of fluctuation of the violation ratio : the violation for @xmath43 is lower than those for others . let us mention that therein another locally realistic model turned out to be more optimal occasionally , whereas this is not the case here .",
    "second , we observe the effect known from ref .",
    "the violation ratio is the highest for two settings for two and three qudits , but for four ( and presumably for more ) parties , the violation grows with @xmath1 , saturating at the limit of @xmath44 .",
    "finally , we should remark that the case of @xmath45 recovers the mermin inequalities @xcite .",
    "we are also able to find the violation of the inequalities in the limit of @xmath44 .",
    "the quantum side of the inequality reads @xmath46 on the other hand , since @xmath47 has a well distinguished global maximum at @xmath48 with integer @xmath20 , the optimal local realistic model is equivalent to integrating the correlation function over all @xmath30 in intervals @xmath49 $ ] ; @xmath50 again , this formula is in a perfect agreement with the results of ref .",
    "it also guaranties exponential growth of violation strength with the number of parties . for qubits",
    ", it behaves like @xmath51 , for qutrits ",
    "@xmath52 , for ququats ",
    "@xmath53 , and for qusexts ( @xmath54 ) ",
    "the violation growth factor tends to 1 as @xmath56 .",
    "still , for any finite @xmath4 and @xmath0 , we observe a firm violation .",
    "another generalization of measurement outcomes on a qudit are @xmath4th order roots of unity over the complex field .",
    "they combine the approach described above  multiplying outcomes  with those described below  assigning objects to their sums modulo @xmath4 .",
    "local detectors are labeled 0 to @xmath5 in a natural manner , and once measurements are done , local outcomes @xmath57 are summed and @xmath58 is taken as a global outcome . the quantum correlation function reads @xmath59.\\ ] ] obviously , one of the functions in the scalar products is complex conjugate .",
    "in fact , we will compare @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "note that detector labelling implies a strong constrain on locally realistic models .",
    "if a model assigns some outcome @xmath62 to angle @xmath30 , it must consequently assign @xmath63 to @xmath64 , etc ..    the procedure is the same as in other strategies ; the inequalities for few low values of @xmath65 , and @xmath0 are studied case - by - case to give us the idea about the structure of the optimal local realistic model .",
    "this turns out to assign a fixed outcome to an interval of angles , say , 0 to @xmath66 , which we will call a packed model .",
    "interestingly , for optimal models , @xmath67 is strictly real .",
    "violations for finite @xmath1 for @xmath68 are given in tables [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] . in case of @xmath44",
    ", we were able to find a formula for violation , @xmath69}\\left[\\frac{\\pi ( d-1)}{d \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{d}}\\right]^n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] naturally , the violation is guaranteed for any @xmath0 for @xmath70 , as the result from @xcite must be recovered .",
    "however , for any finite @xmath0 , the inequality is violated up to a certain value of @xmath4 , and above that threshold , it is satisfied , tending to @xmath71 as @xmath56 .",
    "this is somewhat expected , since for large @xmath4 , various powers of @xmath72 can be close to one another .",
    "numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ violcomplex ] ) reveals that violation is sustained up to @xmath73",
    "now , we will consider strategies , in which sums modulo @xmath4 of label of the detectors that have clicked are translated to a mathematical object , either a dichotomic scalar , or a @xmath6-dimesional vector .",
    "first , let us discuss the vectors , which are defined in an iterative way ,    @xmath74    note that these vectors satisfy relations @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "the correlation function is similar the one from ref .",
    "@xcite , but formulated for arbitrarily many qudits : @xmath79    finally , we also investigate a dichotomic real scalar assigned to sums modulo @xmath4 of local outcomes .",
    "specifically , we assign @xmath28 if the sum was 0 , and @xmath29 otherwise . in this case @xmath80 in both of these cases , the results match exactly those presented in tables [ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] , and [ tab2a ] .",
    "also , we get the same formula for violation in case of @xmath44 .",
    "having found three out of four strategies giving equivalent in the bell scenario given above , we want to find a difference between them by altering the design of the experiment .",
    "particularly , we consider biased ghz states ( of schmidt rank @xmath5 ) , @xmath81 again , we found the same results for both vectors and scalars assigned to sums modulo @xmath4 .",
    "there are few instances ( e.g. , @xmath82 ) where finite @xmath1 is optimal , but the inequality is not violated . in most cases , inequalities for @xmath44",
    "become optimal , and the violation ratio reads @xmath83 for @xmath84 the violation ratio grows with @xmath4 , while for @xmath85 it drops .",
    "for @xmath86 the inequalities are the weakest at @xmath87 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : violation ] ) .",
    "the scenario with scalar dichotomic outcomes is a bit stronger than the previous ones .",
    "for @xmath68 it is optimal to take @xmath88 .",
    "it requires @xmath89 for two particles and @xmath90 for three to observe violation .",
    "the violation ratio grows with dimension to saturate at 1.154 for @xmath91 . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the scenario with @xmath44 is the optimal one and the inequalities become again equivalent to the previous strategies .",
    "the ratios for scalar dichotomic outcomes are given in table [ tab6 ] for @xmath68 and @xmath88 .",
    "when we assign complex outcomes , the correlation function becomes factorizable , @xmath93 and hence the inequality can not be violated .",
    "we have investigated different strategies to formulate geometric bis for collections of @xmath4-dimensional subsystems .",
    "we have been able to demonstrate that a ghz states of @xmath94 qudits surprisingly , we have found that three out of four strategies discussed here turned out equivalent .",
    "we got the same results when we multiplied real dichotomic local outcomes , or summed them modulo @xmath4 and assigned a scalar or a vector .",
    "this means that in case of the bell scenarios presented here , any specific correlation has the same amount of nonclassicality , since we take the sum over all combinations of local measurement settings .    also , we have demonstrated that assigning complex numbers to local events provides , in general , lower violation ratios than the other strategies . in particular , we observe that in the case of @xmath44 , @xmath0 must be sufficiently large for fixed @xmath4 for the inequality to be violated .",
    "this is , most likely , the consequence of the fact that for large dimensions , @xmath4th order roots of unity are close to one another , causing various local events to be less distinguishable .    interestingly , a difference between the strategies arises when biased ghz states are considered .",
    "the dichotomic local outcome method separates from summing modulo @xmath4 providing violation in more cases of low @xmath4 and @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", assigning complex outcomes leads to a factorisable correlation function .",
    "we would also like to stress that these bis are relevant for analyzing the bright squeezed vacuum ( bsv ) state .",
    "the structure of each @xmath95-pair component of bsv is identical to the one of two - qudit singlets , and the unitary transformation can be conveniently realized with a polarization - dependent phase shift .",
    "however , an experimental challenge is to realize a projection on an unbiased superposition of all polarization states .",
    "still , it might be possible to find similar inequalities utilizing projections more feasible in an experiment . in any case",
    ", bis described here are yet another way to analyze bsv theoretically .",
