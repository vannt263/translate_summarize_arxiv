    "classical random walks have been generalized to retain a history of previous positions .",
    "the self - avoiding random walk was introduced to model configurations of polymers  @xcite .",
    "even before the model was formalized , it was recognized that the self - avoidance condition would lead to increased scaling of the linear size of the conformation with the length of the polymer and hence increased viscosity  @xcite .",
    "nothing has been proved about this scaling ( above dimension 1 ) , however , but a closely related model , the loop - erased random walk , has been defined and is more amenable to analysis  @xcite . consequently the latter has been incorporated into improved algorithms for uniformly sampling spanning trees in a graph  @xcite and more generally into the propp - wilson algorithm for exact sampling from the equilibrium distribution of a markov chain  @xcite .",
    "given what is known about classical and quantum random walks , and about classical random walks with memory , it is very natural to investigate quantum counterparts of the latter .",
    "several groups have done so , proposing a variety of models for history dependent qrw  @xcite , including one ( in continuous time  @xcite ) explicitly motivated by the algorithmic problem of finding a connecting path in the glued binary trees problem mentioned above .",

    "we combine these observations to show that each of the history dependent qrw defined to date is , in fact , a qlga and thus , _ a fortiori _ , a qca . beyond providing a unifying framework within which to construct and compare these models , qca , with their physical interpretation as discretized quantum field theories , suggest possible physical meanings , and even instantiations , of history dependent qrw",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : qrw ] we introduce discrete quantum random walks , and describe the extensions of these models to include particle and site history dependence . in section  [ sec : qlga ] we introduce the quantum lattice - gas automata before formulating qrw with history dependence as qlga in section  [ sec : qrwqlga ] . finally , we consider non - reversing and non - repeating walks as two - dimensional qlga in section  [ sec : nrnr ] .",
    "we close the paper with some discussion and directions for future work .",
    "we first describe a qrw and then include the history dependence as in  @xcite .",

    "the qrw hilbert space @xmath12 is @xmath13 by construction , @xmath12 has an inner product , and its accompanying norm , induced from those on the component spaces ( product of the respective inner products on basis elements , extended by linearity to @xmath12 ) .",

    "the resulting change in the two - dimensional velocity tensor factor is analogous to a coin flip , so this tensor factor is often described as a `` coin '' .",
    "since we are emphasizing physical interpretations in this paper , we will refer to it as velocity  @xcite .",
    "the qrw transition @xmath19 is @xmath20 in  @xcite , the symmetric scattering matrix , @xmath21 is used to derive the dirac equation as a continuum limit of the qrw .",
    "history dependent qrw  @xcite build upon this basic model in two ways , which we classify as _ particle _ and _ site _ history dependence .",
    "particle history refers to models in which a particle , as it scatters from a site , updates a finite history stored in extra internal degrees of freedom , without any effect on the site .",
    "the sites can be described as being _",
    "inert_. the history that the particle carries then influences its future scattering . in the standard qrw",
    "this is a one - step history preserving only the memory of the velocity from the previous scattering . in general",
    ", this history can be a `` filtered '' version of the previous scatterings , preserved in some finite dimensional hilbert space that is part of the particle s internal state .",
    "the general hilbert space in this case would be @xmath22 for some finite - dimensional _ particle history _",
    "hilbert space @xmath23 . scattering at a site then affects the tensor factor @xmath23 and the advection is an operation on the tensor factor @xmath3 controlled by the state of @xmath23 .",
    "we can fit most of the history dependent qrw that have been defined previously into this framework .    1 .   [ scmem ]",
    "several previous models maintain a history comprising a length @xmath24 `` tail '' of previous velocities  @xcite , recorded in @xmath24 qubits appended to the qrw position .",
    "these are updated at each time step .",
    "the current velocity is chosen in a cyclic manner from the multiple ( @xmath24 ) velocities . at time",
    "step @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , that velocity is scattered by a scattering operator @xmath27 , and the resulting velocity is used in the advection step .",
    "[ snmem ] another approach is to construct a model which maintains a history comprising a length @xmath24 `` tail '' of sites visited prior to the current site  @xcite .",
    "the step operation , i.e. , the next right or left site , is determined in a two stages : by flipping a coin ( quantum ) and then scattering the current velocity with a symmetric matrix that either `` reflects '' ( reverses the previous velocity ) or `` transmits '' ( maintains the previous velocity ) , according to the coin outcome .",
    "it is clear that case  [ snmem ] can be mapped to case  [ scmem ] as far as the history of previous sites is concerned , since a history of sites can be rephrased as a history of previous velocity values .",
    "we therefore only consider velocity memory . in the case",
    "[ scmem ] models  @xcite , in order to store the history , the single velocity qubit of a qrw is replaced with multiple velocity qubits , @xmath28 .",
    "the hilbert space for a qrw with particle history is then @xmath29 computational basis elements of the hilbert space @xmath12 can be taken as @xmath30 where @xmath4 is the position , and @xmath31 , @xmath26 , hold the history of velocities .",
    "the memory of the velocities is updated each time a velocity is used to determine the next site .",
    "the qrw transition in brun , carteret and ambainis model  @xcite and in rohde , brennen and gilchrist s model  @xcite ( both described by case  [ scmem ] above ) scatters the velocity that happened @xmath24 steps ago .",
    "thus it is convenient to split the scattering into two distinct stages as in  @xcite , the first of which is the selection of the velocity to scatter or the _ memory _ operation and the other is the _ ricochet _ operation that refers to the interaction between the particle and the site .",
    "since the site is inert , this is also described as the _ self - interaction _ of a particle .",

    "once phrased in terms of the current position and previous velocities , the hilbert space on which this qrw is defined is @xmath44 written in this form , we can designate the first @xmath11 tensor factor of @xmath23 as the  control \" variable needed in determining the mode of scattering and the remaining @xmath11 factors are the record of previous velocities .",
    "the computational basis elements of the hilbert space @xmath12 are @xmath45 where @xmath4 is the position , @xmath46 is the control state , and @xmath31 , @xmath26 , hold the history of velocities .",
    "the model studied in  @xcite uses a history with one previous velocity , @xmath47 , or equivalently one previous position ( two positions in total ) .",
    "we give a simple generalization of the scattering scheme used there to an arbitrary number of velocities @xmath24 .",
    "there is a memory operation as in the particle history dependence just considered , performing a circular shift of the velocity history .",
    "then there is a two - stage operation .",
    "its first stage is the _ ricochet - control _ whose outcome determines the next ricochet mode .",
    "this ricochet - control is a simple symmetric scattering on the @xmath48 factor ( control variable ) .",
    "the next stage is the _ ricochet _ operation which is a controlled action by the control variable on the velocity part of the space to determine the velocity for the next move .",

    "in contrast to particle history , camilleri , rohde and twamley consider a different kind of history dependence in  @xcite , the history of site visits .",
    "this history is the result of the particle changing the state of a site when it scatters from it . in this sense ,",
    "the sites are _",
    "active_. the state of each site then affects how the particle scatters at the site in the future .    just as in the particle history , one might like to retain the history of each site by an identical finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath64 per site .",
    "assuming that there are @xmath24 sites , i.e. , the lattice has size @xmath24 , this requires appending a space @xmath65 to keep track of the site history of every site .",
    "the qrw hilbert space is then @xmath66 where @xmath23 is the particle history hilbert space as before .    in  @xcite",

    "then the qrw hilbert space becomes @xmath67 in this case @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "a position is given by an element of @xmath70 , with a computational basis composed of elements @xmath4 , @xmath71 .",
    "the velocity space @xmath23 has the computational basis @xmath72 .",
    "the record of a visit to the site @xmath73 is in the corresponding @xmath73-th tensor factor ( qubit ) of @xmath74 , with the basis of @xmath11 in that factor taken as @xmath75 , denoting the  not visited \" state and @xmath76 , denoting the  have visited \" state .",
    "a basis element of the state of all the memory qubits is @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the memory qubit corresponding to site @xmath71 .",
    "we , therefore , write a computational basis elements of the hilbert space @xmath12 as @xmath79 the memory qubits are a record of the site history , hence are part of a different hilbert space that can not be grouped together with the particle history .",
    "the memory for a site is updated each time that site is visited , and the scattering of a particle at that site is controlled by the state of the corresponding memory qubit .",
    "thus , unlike the case of particle history , scattering can not be said to act on the `` velocity space '' independently of the other parts .",
    "the operations included in a transition are :    1 .",
    "[ memo3 ] memory ( implicitly controlled by @xmath4 ) , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the symmetric scattering matrix , parameterized by @xmath82 ( the memory strength ) , @xmath83 2 .",

    "then the transition becomes @xmath98    notice that @xmath99 is @xmath100 ; while it is natural for these scattering matrices to be symmetric , since that encodes parity invariance ( left - right symmetry ) , the obvious generalization is to simply use two different values of @xmath101 in the @xmath18 matrix of eq .",
    "for the two cases .",
    "moreover , since @xmath101 goes to the ( effective ) mass in the continuum limit  @xcite , these choices have a physical meaning .",
    "notice also that the site history comprises a `` parallel '' memory in the sense that since the particle position is a superposition of sites at each timestep , the entire `` checker - board '' of site history is now entangled with the position and particle history .",
    "a natural interpretation of these _ active _ sites is as a lattice of immobile particles , a discrete background quantum field  @xcite , that interacts with the hopping particle of the qrw .",
    "we note , in passing , that this is essentially a quantum mechanical version of the classical lorentz ( or wind - tree ) lattice gas model introduced in  @xcite . furthermore , since there is no necessary parity invariance in the interaction of the moving particle with an immobile particle @xmath81 may be generalized to an arbitrary unitary matrix , not necessarily symmetric .",
    "this _ active _ site interpretation suggests a multi - particle picture in which one is concerned with the presence or absence of particles at all the sites simultaneously , viewing the checker - board as the state of a set of static particles , rather than keeping track of the position and velocity of a single particle .",
    "the evolution is local in the sense that only when a hopping particle arrives at a site can it bounce off the static particle and go to one of the neighbors , affecting the site and itself .",
    "notice that in the qrw with site history example just given , the hilbert space dimension grows exponentially , as @xmath102 .",
    "this is not the recipe for a useful hilbert space with a nice topology ; rather , one might want to control the hilbert space dimension .",
    "these ideas are incorporated in a multiparticle generalization of the types of qrw we have just discussed : quantum lattice gas automata ( qlga )  @xcite , which we describe in the next section .",
    "a qlga is a model of particles on a lattice propagating and scattering by interactions when they arrive at lattice sites ( or cells )  @xcite .",
    "each site / cell has a set of neighboring cells and the particles are exchanged with those neighbors .",
    "we consider the qlga model as formulated in  @xcite .",
    "take the lattice of cells to be @xmath103 .",
    "each cell can be occupied by multiple particles , and each particle has a state which is a vector in a _ subcell _ hilbert space .",
    "let us say that the internal states of particle @xmath104 , @xmath105 , are elements of the subcell hilbert space @xmath106 , so the cell hilbert space is @xmath107 . in the propagation stage of the evolution , a particle with internal state @xmath104 ( or equivalently , that occupies subcell state @xmath104 ) hops to the corresponding subcell @xmath104 of a designated neighboring cell , @xmath108 away .",
    "the collection of such neighbors is specified by the _ neighborhood _",

    "these sequences , called the _ finite configurations _ , consist of a finite region of cells in _ active _ states immersed in a background of cells in a fixed _ quiescent _ state . for our purposes , we take the quiescent state to be @xmath118 , while the rest are active .",
    "we write the _ finite configurations _ basis of the qlga hilbert space , the _ hilbert space of finite configurations _ , as @xmath119 explicitly , each @xmath120 , where each @xmath121 is a basis element of the subcell space @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath122 is thus orthonormal under the inner product induced from @xmath106 .",
    "this definition of the finite configurations basis , @xmath122 , ensures that it is countable , so that the hilbert space of finite configurations is separable ( in the topological sense ) .",
    "this hilbert space naming convention is adopted from  @xcite ; in the mathematics literature , it is called an _ incomplete infinite tensor product _ space , as in  @xcite .",

    "the underlying structure is an incomplete tensor product space and the evolution is defined by two operations .",
    "one is advection ( propagation ) which is completely specified by cell decomposition into subcells and the corresponding neighborhood elements , and the other is scattering that happens at each site and is the sole interaction amongst the particles .",
    "note that in this interpretation the active site model described in subsection  [ subsec : qrwhistn ] whose hilbert space is given by eq .   is a hybrid between first and second quantized representations .",
    "the position of the particle has a first quantized representation , while the labels of the active sites have a second quantized representation .",
    "this already suggests that a fully second quantized picture , or qlga , may have utility for qrw with history dependence , and it is this reformulation we turn to in the next section .",
    "in general , a discrete - time qrw is a qlga restricted to a single - particle subspace .",
    "the simplest example of this is the original qlga constructed by meyer  @xcite .",
    "we begin this section with a description of this model in the current context  @xcite and show how it restricts to a qrw .",
    "let us recall the example qlga of  @xcite .",
    "the cell hilbert space is @xmath130 , with two subcells ; each subcell space is a qubit , @xmath131 .",
    "the neighborhood is @xmath132 ( the neighborhood elements @xmath133 , @xmath134 seem opposite to the respective movement directions of the subcell elements , but this is required by the expression for advection @xmath123 in eq .  ) .",
    "the local scattering operator @xmath18 , in the ordered basis of @xmath112 , @xmath135 , is @xmath136 @xmath18 conserves particle number  since both @xmath137 and @xmath138 are eigenvectors , while the middle @xmath139 block acts on the subspace span@xmath140 .",
    "this means that an evolution that begins in the single - particle sector will remain in the single particle sector , a fact that underpins the intrepretation of discrete time quantum random walks as a subclass of the dynamics of qlga . the time evolution is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figqq1 ] .",
    "now let us interpret the state @xmath141 at cell @xmath73 as the walker in a qrw at site @xmath73 moving to the right , i.e. , in state @xmath142 at the end of the scattering step . in the same way ,",
    "interpret the state @xmath143 at cell @xmath73 as the walker in a qrw at site @xmath73 moving to the left , i.e. , in state @xmath144 at the end of the scattering step .",
    "assume that the state of the qlga is such that it is quiescent everywhere except at one cell @xmath73 where it is @xmath141 , i.e. , it is in the single particle sector and is given by @xmath145 then after the advection step , it is @xmath146 similarly , if the initial state is @xmath147 then after the advection step , it is @xmath148 the scattering operator , as mentioned , acts locally on each cell by @xmath18 , and invariantly on the subspace span@xmath149 , the @xmath139 block representing the local scattering operator .",
    "hence the qrw is captured completely by the single - particle sector of a qlga , the space spanned by @xmath150 restricted to the single particle sector , if the local scattering operator @xmath18 is as shown in eq .  .",
    "the basic ingredients of the qrw as a restricted qlga have been demonstrated by this simple example .",
    "now that we have shown that a standard qrw model can be embedded in a qlga , we proceed to the more complicated models with history .",

    "[ figqq1 ] applies to this case as well .    the local scattering operator @xmath125 needs to account for the current dynamics as in the qrw without memory above , but must also do the book - keeping required to keep the history of the velocities .",

    "notice that this formulation suggests a generalization with a different scattering operator that still conserves the particle number ( only allows states of this form ) , but , as a result of the scattering at the site , alters the internal state .",

    "this model maintains a history of visits to each site by the particle by keeping a qubit that records whether the site has been visited or not by acting on the qubit , each time a site is visited , through a symmetric scattering matrix whose `` memory strength '' is the parameter of the scattering matrix .",
    "based on the record of a previous visit or not , the particle scatters differently through a controlled scattering matrix : scattering in a balanced manner without a prior visit , and scattering by a `` back - action '' scattering matrix if there has been a visit to the site . for a finite lattice of size",
    "@xmath24 , this requires a hilbert space of dimension @xmath102 to capture the position , velocity and the record of visits to each node .",
    "once again we note that this hilbert space is a hybrid between first and second quantized representations .",
    "the qlga model encodes , in the cell hilbert space , in addition to the velocity of the particle , the memory of whether each site has been visited in the past .",
    "the cell hilbert space therefore includes one more qubit than does the original qlga we described at the beginning of this section  @xcite .",
    "a cell has three subcells , and each subcell space is @xmath176 , so the cell hilbert space is @xmath177 .",
    "two of the subcells encode the walker s state as in the original qlga , and the third subcell records the memory of visits to that site . recall that the history of visits to a site belongs to the site itself ; it does not hop with the walker .",
    "thus , if we choose the subcell @xmath178 to be the memory qubit , then we need to choose the neighborhood as @xmath179 , ensuring that subcell @xmath178 does not shift .",
    "advection effectively only acts on @xmath180 , shifting @xmath154 to the left and @xmath162 to the right .",
    "the local scattering operator @xmath125 accounts for the current dynamics as before , and updates the memory subcell @xmath178 based on the state of @xmath180 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figqq2 ] .        as in the previous case",
    ", such a local scattering can be defined , and split into memory and ricochet operators .",
    "write a basis element of @xmath112 as @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the presence of a left moving particle and @xmath183 is the presence of a right moving particle , and @xmath184 is the memory state , where @xmath75 means `` not visited '' and @xmath76 means `` have visited ''",
    ". then the memory operator acts by @xmath185 where @xmath81 is as in eq .  .",
    "now we describe the action of local ricochet operator @xmath94 on the basis of @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath186 where @xmath187 is the local `` balanced '' ricochet operator ( based on @xmath99 in eq .  ) , and in the basis @xmath135 of @xmath180 is @xmath188 and the `` back action '' ricochet operator , @xmath189 ( based on @xmath190 in eq .  ) , is @xmath191    finally , the scattering operator @xmath18 is @xmath192 fig .",

    "thus the qlga model elegantly and efficiently captures the structure and dynamics of qrw with site dependent history .",
    "the hilbert space has countable dimension even though the lattice and hence the particle s position is unbounded .",
    "this contrasts with the original qrw with site dependent history , in which the hilbert space dimension grows exponentially with the size of the lattice .",
    "moreover , the qlga model provides the physical interpretation of a background quantum field interacting at every site with the particle .",
    "proctor et al .  construct a qrw on a two - dimensional lattice , with special class of scattering operators that have a memory in the sense that they either prevent the walker from going in the same direction for two consecutive steps ( _ non - repeating _ ) , or ensure that the site just visited is not visited again at the next step ( _ non - reversing _ )  @xcite . in this section",
    "we show that this qrw can also be realized as a qlga model .",
    "the lattice is @xmath193 , so positions are denoted by @xmath194 , and velocities take values in a @xmath195-dimensional vector space @xmath196 in which the basis elements @xmath197 signify the velocity directions west , east , south , north , respectively .",
    "the hilbert space for this case is @xmath198 with typical basis elements written as @xmath199 .",
    "a qrw evolves through two consecutive unitary actions on its state as in the original one - dimensional qrw .    1 .   [ proprr ] advection @xmath200 2 .",

    ", we introduce two - dimensional qlga and reemphasize how a scattering matrix of a qrw embeds in a qlga scattering rule .",
    "we generalize the one - dimensional qlga model to a two dimensional lattice , and show how this captures the non - reversing and non - repeating qrw .",
    "the lattice is @xmath193 .",
    "since a particle can go in four directions , we need a neighborhood of four elements corresponding to the directions of the moves . thus , the neighborhood is @xmath211 , corresponding to the directions @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "each cell , instead of consisting of two copies of @xmath11 recording the presence of a left or right moving particle , now has four copies of @xmath11 , comprising the cell hilbert space @xmath213 , with four subcells .",
    "each subcell space is @xmath214 so that the basis elements @xmath215 represent the presence of a @xmath212 moving particle .",
    "the basis elements of the hilbert space of the qlga are thus @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the basis element of cell hilbert space of the cell @xmath218 , such that @xmath219 . as defined above , @xmath106 is the hilbert space of the subcell @xmath104 of the cell @xmath220 .    the evolution of a qlga , as in the one - dimensional lattice case , has two stages :    1 .",

    "the qlga global evolution @xmath128 is @xmath225 this example illustrates a two dimensional version of a qrw as a qlga .",
    "we now see that at a local level the qlga resource requirement , i.e. , the cell hilbert space dimension , increases exponentially with the dimension of the lattice , while globally , for any fixed lattice dimension , the qlga hilbert space s dimension ( dimension of the hilbert space of finite configurations ) is still countable by construction .",
    "in this paper , we examined several history dependent qrw and showed how they fit into a multiparticle model of qlga .",
    "this required us to classify the history dependent qrw into two categories : qrw with dependence on particle history , and qrw with dependence on site history .",
    "doing so demonstrated that history dependent qrw are naturally interpretable as a multiparticle qlga restricted to a single - particle sector interacting with a background of static particles .",
    "the presence of the single particle , moving in a specific direction , is encoded in a product of qubits at each site , one for each allowed velocity .",
    "the same number of additional tensor factors encode the memory state of the moving particle ( or particles , since the model generalizes immediately to multiple moving particles with memory ) , while yet another tensor factor encodes the memory state of the site .",
    "the latter tensor factors constitute what is essentially a background quantum field  @xcite , with which the moving particle interacts .",
    "this identification immediately suggested several generalizations to the history dependent qrw from which we started , and demonstrated that the site history models  @xcite are quantum versions of well - studied classical models  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the construction of qlga we have used  @xcite also addresses one of the major concerns about the exponential growth of the dimension of hilbert space in the model of qrw in  @xcite .",
    "we gave explicit constructions of qlga equivalent to the main examples in each category of history dependent qrw .",
    "this includes two dimensional models , e.g. , the qlga described in the last subsection is equivalent to qrw on a two dimensional lattice that are non - reversing ( not revisiting the immediately previous site ) or non - repeating ( not repeating a hop in the same direction )  @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretations of various history dependent qrw that become natural when the model is identified as a qlga seem likely to provide at least heuristic , if not analytic , explanations for numerically observed behaviors like `` anomalous '' quantum diffusion and decoherence / transition to classicality .",
    "these improved understandings may motivate construction of novel quantum algorithms , possibly analogous to classical algorithms based upon history dependent random walks .",
    "furthermore , since qlga models are not restricted to the single ( moving ) particle sector , they provide a natural framework within which to extend history dependent qrw to multiple interacting walkers .",
    "independent _ qrw with multiple particles are capable of universal quantum computation  @xcite , so there are likely to be quantum algorithmic applications for multiparticle sectors of qlga encoding history dependent walkers ."
