    "the leggett garg inequality ( lgi ) @xcite is useful to test the quantumness of a system through successive measurement outcomes at different times on the same system . in our previous work @xcite",
    "we showed that two - states neutral kaon oscillations and two - states neutrino oscillations are quantum phenomena by demonstrating that the lgi is violated in both cases .",
    "note that the kaon and neutrino cases comprised two different kinds of two state systems .",
    "oscillations between @xmath8-@xmath9 states indicate a decaying two state oscillating quantum system . on the other hand , neutrino oscillations between the two flavour eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath11 signify a conservative two state quantum system . in @xcite for a decaying kaon system , the maximum violation of lgi in the presence of cp violation is when the correlator @xmath12 ( defined below in section 2 ) while in the absence of cp violation the lgi violation is maximum when @xmath13 .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the tsirelson bound for the lgi in two - states system given by @xmath14 . in case of conservative two - flavour neutrino oscillations",
    "the maximum violation of lgi is which is when @xmath15 .",
    "similar work has also been done in two - states neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "there the authors have demonstrated how oscillation phenomena can be used to test for violations of the classical bound by performing measurements on an ensemble of neutrinos at distinct energies .",
    "existence of neutrino mass has been a subject of keen interest over the last fifty years @xcite . in 2001 the third generation of neutrinos ( tau neutrino ) were discovered by the donut collaboration @xcite .",
    "exhaustive details regarding various aspects of neutrino masses and oscillations can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "therefore , we are motivated to investigate the lgi in the scenario of 3-flavoured neutrino , both without and with cp violation . the effect of cp violation for three flavoured neutrino oscillations may stimulate further investigations in this area",
    "we also consider matter interactions with the neutrino .",
    "here we have analysed the lgi in the context of two small parameters , _ viz . _ the sine of the mixing angle @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the mass hierarchy parameter @xmath18 .",
    "note that the mixing angles are eulerian angles relating the ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath19 ) to the mass eigenstates ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) in the relevant space as shown in fig.1 .    in section 2",
    ", we give a brief introduction of lgi . in section 3",
    "we discuss the three flavoured neutrino oscillations . in section 4",
    "the lgi is evaluated and analysed . in section 5 an outline",
    "is given of how one can actually experimentally verify the lgi in three flavoured neutrino oscillations .",
    "section 6 summarises our results .",
    "appendix is in section 7 .",
    "bell s inequality ( bi ) @xcite is based on the assumption of _ local realism _ - a intrinsic property of classical physics .",
    "violation of local realism signifies quantum phenomena .",
    "bi is a testable algebric inequality constructed from certain combination of correlation functions for the outcomes of an observable quantity measurement on two spatially seperated system at the same instant of time .",
    "bi is violated by quantum physics in the present of quantum entanglement between two spatially seperated system , and implies that the quantum world is non - local @xcite .",
    "later leggett and garg @xcite constructed another algebraic inequality based on the assumption of _ macrorealism _ in terms of the time separated correlation functions corresponding to the successive measurement outcomes at different times on a single system .",
    "the assumptions underlying the leggett - garg inequality @xcite are _ macroscopic realism _ ( mr ) and _ noninvasive measurability_(nim ) .",
    "mr means a macroscopic system during its time evolution , is ( at any instant time ) in a definite one of the available states .",
    "nim means it is possible in principle to determine which of the states the system is in , without affecting the states itself or the system s subsequent dynamics .",
    "these two together constitute _",
    "macrorealism_.    consider a two state system and an observable quantity @xmath23 such that whenever measured it takes values @xmath24 or @xmath25 for the system is in state 1 or 2 respectively .",
    "further consider a collection of runs starting from identical initial conditions such that in the first set of runs @xmath26 is measured at times @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; in the second at @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; in the third at @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; in the fourth at @xmath27 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . from such measurement",
    "it is straight forward to determine the temporal correlation function @xmath32 and any physical system obeying asumption of macrorealistic theory gives the leggett - garg inequality @xcite : @xmath33 a wide range of various quantum system violates the upper bound of lgi and that let the lgi to use it to probe the quantum mechanics ( qm ) in the macroscopic regime @xcite .",
    "a detailed review about lgi can be found in @xcite .",
    "the legget - garg inequlity involves the time parameter whereas the probabilities ( given below in section 3 onwards ) are expressed in terms of the base line length parameter @xmath34 . but",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 is the velocity of light .",
    "so @xmath37 is automatically present .",
    "now the correlations in time are transcribed into correlations in length .",
    "consider an @xmath38-states system .",
    "as before , measurements of a macroscopic property @xmath26 can yield only two value @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath26 is a dichotomic variable .",
    "if some states ( say @xmath40 states where @xmath41 ) take the value @xmath24 then all the remaining @xmath42 states will take the value @xmath25 .",
    "this is no problem because states with same value of @xmath26 may be considered as _ microscopically _ distinct states with same macroscopic property @xmath26 .",
    "mr and nim then imply that the system has a definite value of @xmath26 at all times and this value is independent of previous measurements on the system . therefore , the bound for eq .",
    "( [ lgi ] ) in macrorealistic theories remains the same .",
    "we now consider lgi in 3-states systems with specific attention to the three flavoured neutrino oscillations .",
    "during propagation neutrinos undergo oscillations among the three flavoured eigenstates @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath19 . consider the standard parameterization of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xmath43 that mixes the 3 neutrino flavour states @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the mixing angles , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the dirac - type cp - violating phase .",

    "@xmath26 takes the value @xmath25 if the system is found in any one of the muon neutrino @xmath11 or tau neutrino @xmath19 states .",

    "an interesting point in the expression of @xmath76 is that for neutrino beam with given energy the correlation @xmath76 show dependence on @xmath71 as well as the spacial separation @xmath79 .",
    "it is also important to note that in the case of two flavoured neutrino oscillations the correlation function depend only on the spacial seperation @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the other correlation functions , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be calculated in the same way and they also give similar feature .",
    "next one can evaluate the correlation function @xmath83 defined in the eq.([lgi ] ) in order to study the maximum violation of lgi for three flavoured neutrino oscillations .",

    "it is very important to note that the maximum qm violation of lgi in this case is significantly smaller than the maximum qm value of @xmath83 we calculted @xcite in the case of two flavoured neutrino oscillation which was @xmath99 . for the given value of @xmath100 km , the variation of the quantity @xmath83 with @xmath85",
    "is shown in the fig.2 .",
    "now we will investigate how the mixing angle @xmath3 affect the maximum value of the quantity @xmath83 .",
    "if we put @xmath101 , the maximum value of @xmath83 becomes @xmath102 for @xmath103 km and @xmath104 km .",
    "this is much lower than the actual value @xmath105 when @xmath106 .",
    "this value still belongs to the quantum domain because it is lager than @xmath107 .",
    "so the presence of the mixing angle @xmath3 in three flavour neutrino oscillations enhance the maximum violation of lgi by the amount @xmath108 .",
    "if we increase @xmath3 from zero degree we see that the maximum value of the quantity @xmath83 also increases .",
    "this means increasing the mixing angle @xmath3 also increases the quantumness of the three flavoured neutrino oscillation .",
    "the variation of @xmath83 with @xmath3 is shown in the fig.3 below    one of the key parameter in three flavour neutrino oscillation is the _ small _ mass hierarchy parameter @xmath64 . in this section",
    "we investigate the dependence of the quantity @xmath83 with the small mass hierarchy parameter @xmath109 . if we put @xmath110 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath111 the maximum value of the quantity @xmath83 becomes @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "it is interesting to note that although now @xmath111 the maximum bound of the quantity @xmath83 is greater than @xmath107 , i.e. , we are still in the quantum domain . for two state",
    "neutrino oscillations , @xcite the condition @xmath111 implies that the maximum value of @xmath83 is @xmath107 , i.e. _ one is in the classical domain.!_. this is logical because this means there is only one neutrino mass and so there can not be any oscillations .",
    "however , for three state neutrino oscillations there are three neutrino masses and if two of them become equal then also there will exist possibility of neutrino oscillations because now there are effectively two masses . in the present case of three state neutrino",
    "oscillation the presence of the non zero value of @xmath109 increase the the maximum value of the quantity @xmath83 which is shown in the fig.4 . in the fig.4 blue , orange , green and red color graphs are the behaviour of the quantity @xmath83 for the value of @xmath114 @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117(actual experimentally measured value ) and @xmath118 . for",
    "the present experimentally measured value of @xmath109 the maximum value of the quantity @xmath83 increase about @xmath6 .",
    "so the presence of non zero @xmath109 increase the quantumness in the case of three flavor neutrino oscillation .",
    "next we investigate the effect of the cp violating phase @xmath48 parameter in the maximum value of the quantity @xmath83 .",
    "if we ignore the cp violating phase @xmath48 parameter in the expression of the quantity @xmath83 we observe that the maximum value of @xmath83 reduces to @xmath119 for @xmath100 km and @xmath120 km . so presence of cp violating phase @xmath48 parameter actually enhance the maximum violation of lgi by an amount @xmath121 , a significant enhancement .",
    "that means the effect of the cp violation actually enhance the quantum ness of the three flavor neutrion oscillation system .",
    "it is worth to mention that in the case of neutral kaon oscillation the presence of the cp violation enhance the maximum violation of lgi by an amount @xmath122 @xcite which is @xmath123 enhancement whereas here the effect of cp violation increment of maximum violation of lgi is @xmath7 .",
    "so when lgi is concern the effect of the cp violation is much more in three flavoured neutrino oscillation compared to neutral kaon system . in the fig.5 we focus around the region where the the quantity @xmath83 takes its maximum value both with and without cp violation .",
    "to test experimentally the maximum violation of lgi for three flavoured neutrino oscillations the first thing necessary is the determination of the correlation function @xmath76 . for this the observable quantity",
    "@xmath26 has to be measured at two different times @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath124 ) or equivalently at two different base line lengths @xmath71 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "as already mentioned @xmath26 takes the value @xmath24 when the system is found in electron - neutrino flavour state .",
    "otherwise @xmath26 takes the value @xmath25 .",
    "so @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the joint probability of finding the system in the electron neutrino flavor state at both the distances @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "similar arguments hold for the other @xmath129 joint probabilities : @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 _ note that the scripted probabilities @xmath134 are the ones that are actually measured . _",
    "these are related to the theoretically calculated unscripted probabilities as shown above .",
    "this is necessitated by the fact that here more than one state can have the same value for the dichotomic variable @xmath26 .",
    "it is to be noted that to experimentally verify the maximum violation of lgi the first measurement of @xmath26 at length @xmath71 must satisfy nim .",
    "otherwise measurement proceess will destroy the state of the system and measurement of @xmath26 at the later length @xmath72 will be meaningless as the state has already been disturbed .",
    "this ( nim in the first measurement ) can be ensured using the negative result measurement ( nrm ) @xcite as follows .",
    "let the measuring set - up be arranged so that if the probe is triggered , @xmath135 , while if it is not triggered , @xmath136 .",
    "this ensures that while the untriggered probe provides information about the value of q , there is no interaction occurring between the probe and the measured particle .",
    "so nim is satisfied .",
    "now use only the results of untriggered runs for which @xmath137 .",
    "follow this by the measurement of @xmath26 at @xmath72 .",
    "these results can be used for determining the joint probabilities @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "similarly , for determining the other two joint probabilities @xmath140 and @xmath141 occurring in @xmath76 , the measuring set - up can be inverted so that a value of @xmath137 triggers the probe , while for @xmath135 , it does not . in this way",
    ", one can determine @xmath76 and all the two - time correlation functions occurring in lgi by ensuring nim through the use of the nrm procedure for the first measurement of any pair .",
    "then one can calculate the total correlation @xmath83 using eqn.([lgi ] ) and experimentally verify our results about the maximum violation of lgi in the case of three flavour neutrino oscillation .",
    "in this work we have investigated the violation of the lgi in the case of @xmath129-flavoured neutrino oscillations .",
    "our findings are as follows :    \\(1 ) the maximum value of the correlation @xmath83 is @xmath0 for @xmath1 km and @xmath2 km",
    ".    ( 2)the violation of the classical bound of @xmath83 given by lgi for three flavour neutrino oscillation is @xmath142 .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath107 flavour neutrino oscillations @xcite this violation was @xmath143 .",
    "so the maximum violation of lgi in case of three flavour neutrino oscillations is _ significantly lower than the maximum violation for the two state neutrino oscillation_.    ( 3)if we put @xmath101 , the maximum value of @xmath83 is @xmath144 for @xmath103 km and @xmath104 km .",
    "this is much lower than @xmath105 which is obtained for the experimental value of @xmath145 .",
