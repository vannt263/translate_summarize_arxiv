    "to determine the mass distribution of a galaxy , the jeans equations @xcite are often used .",
    "these equations tie the density distribution and the gravitational potential of a stellar system to its kinematical characteristics : rotation velocities and velocity dispersions .",
    "a recent overview about different dynamical methods , including the ones based on the jeans equations , is given by @xcite .",
    "for solving the jeans equations , certain simplifying assumptions are usually made : stationarity and a certain symmetry .    for spherically symmetric systems ,",
    "good starting points are provided in the literature , e.g. for one integral model by @xcite , for two integral models the osipkov - merritt model @xcite . for the general mass density distribution",
    "the jeans equations were solved e.g. by @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that in some cases the jeans equations can even be solved without assuming stationarity , enabling to study the evolution of galaxies or galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "a typical assumption made for axisymmetric systems is that the phase density of stars is a function of two classical integrals of motion : the energy and the angular momentum . for jeans equations",
    "this means that the velocity dispersion distribution in a meridional @xmath4 plane of a galaxy is isotropic and aligned with the cylindrical coordinates with @xmath5 as the symmetry axis . ] ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the two jeans equations the unknown functions are density , rotational velocity and the two velocity dispersion components ( the poisson equation relates the mass density and the gravitational potential ) . in principle , since mass density can be derived by deprojecting observed surface brightness distribution and rotation velocities and line - of - sight velocity dispersions can also be derived from observations , the mass distribution of a galaxy can be calculated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in some special cases",
    ", the jeans equations can even be solved analytically @xcite .",
    "however , galaxy models based on the two integrals of motion do not always enable a satisfactory fit to the observed kinematics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the hipparcos satellite observations of stellar velocities indicate that in the solar neighbourhood , the calculated velocity dispersions along the three coordinate axes are not equal @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite on the basis of the stripe 82 data from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "away from the milky way plane the observed velocity dispersion ellipsoid is tilted towards the plane @xcite .",
    "these observational facts can be explained by assuming that the phase density depends also on an additional , third integral of motion .",
    "besides , an elegant and powerful method for deriving mass distributions of galaxies has been developed by using the schwarzschild orbit - superposition method @xcite .",
    "this method is independent from solving the jeans equations .",
    "it is clear from these models ( see also @xcite for much earlier orbit calculations ) that the third integral of motion has to be an essential part of the model construction .",
    "if the third integral is taken into account , two additional unknown functions will appear in the jeans equations , the third component of the velocity dispersions and the tilt angle of the velocity dispersion ellipsoid ( see section  [ sec : jeans_eq ] ) .",
    "hence , assumptions about the specific form of the third integral have to be made to solve the jeans equations .",
    "for example , it is known that an analytical third integral form exists for the stckel potential ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this was used by @xcite and @xcite who constructed a galaxy model as a sum of such potentials .",
    "a new , axisymmetric isochrone potential family with three integrals of motion was recently developed by @xcite and kinematical characteristics of the model were calculated .",
    "an actual galaxy can be modelled as a sum of these models .",
    "but even the usage of specific forms of the potential and the integral does not guarantee a satisfactory agreement between the model and the observations .",
    "for particular galaxies , the third integral may merely be a quasi - integral .    in the present paper we study stationary axisymmetric models in the framework of the jeans equations and a third integral of motion .",
    "for the sake of the flexibility of the model , we do not want to limit ourselves with a specific density distribution form . besides , we demand the form of the third integral to be applicable throughout the galaxy , not just in some special cases ( e.g. close to the galactic plane or for nearly circular orbits ) . for these reasons",
    "we use the third integral in the analytical form derived by @xcite ( see section  [ sec : third_integral ] ) and develop a method to find an approximate solution that satisfies both jeans equations .",
    "a galaxy is assumed to be a superposition of several components with density distribution derived from the ( observed ) surface brightness distribution . using the jeans equations",
    ", we calculate the distributions of stellar rotational velocity and velocity dispersion .",
    "the approach is similar to @xcite , where the third integral theory was used to model the sombrero galaxy .",
    "the present work is the extension of the previous work by forfeiting a relation that holds only near to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "our method resembles the method recently developed by @xcite and used for modelling the disc component of the milky way embedded in a dark matter halo . in the referred paper , a form for the third integral",
    "was selected and applied along stellar orbits , determining the best - fit integral value for each orbit .",
    "it was found that the used integral form suited to the orbits rather well ( i.e. remained nearly constant along the orbits ) .",
    "in contrast , we seek a fixed but simple form of the integral providing the best fit to the observed kinematics for the entire galaxy .",
    "since the andromeda galaxy is nearby and has been observed countless times , it is a popular test body for galaxy models . in recent years",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have tested a variety of kinematical modelling techniques on it , gaining mostly consistent results , which allows us to consider the general density distribution of m31 to be sufficiently settled . for test purposes we selected a simple version of bulge + disc + dark matter halo model developed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we present the jeans equations in a form suitable for the present study , introduce the third integral of motion and provide a recipe for solving the jeans equations . in section  [ sec : m31 ] we apply our model to the andromeda galaxy and compare the calculated rotation velocities and velocity dispersions with observations .",
    "a discussion of the results and our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the most general form the jeans equations can be written as ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent cartesian coordinates and velocities , @xmath9 is time , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the mass density and the gravitational potential , and @xmath12 are the components of the velocity dispersion tensor @xmath13 density @xmath10 and gravitational potential @xmath11 are tied through the poisson s equation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant .    as our aim is to develop a model for a multi - component galaxy , all the kinematic variables and densities will be considered per component , except for the gravitational potential , which contains the contribution of all the components .",
    "we assume that mass distribution in a galaxy can be approximated with an axially symmetric model . in this case",
    "the two mixed components of the velocity dispersion tensor are zero @xmath16    if the phase density of a stellar system is a function of the two classical integrals of motion , the energy and the angular momentum integrals , the third mixed component @xmath17 of the dispersion tensor will also be zero and the velocity ellipsoids ( the nonzero diagonal components of the tensor ) will be aligned with the three cylindrical coordinate axes . however , if the phase density is also a function of a third integral of motion , in addition to the two classical ones , the mixed dispersion tensor component @xmath17 will be nonzero . in this case the velocity dispersion tensor takes the diagonal form in some other coordinates .",
    "one axis of the velocity ellipsoid would still coincide with the @xmath18 axis of the cylindrical coordinates ( the ellipsoid lies in a meridional plane of the galaxy ) , but in the @xmath1-@xmath5 plane , the velocity ellipsoid would be tilted by an angle @xmath19 with respect to the galactic plane or the @xmath1 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] for illustration ; do not pay attention to the elliptical coordinate set at this point ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath17 is related to the tilt angle @xmath19 via the relation @xmath20 denoting @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for brevity , the shape of the velocity ellipsoid can be described by the axial ratios of the ellipsoid @xmath24    assuming a stationary axisymmetric mass distribution and using relations ( [ eq : sega12 ] ) , ( [ eq : sega3 ] ) and designations ( [ eq : kz.def ] ) , ( [ eq : kt.def ] ) , the jeans equations can be written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath25 where @xmath26 in cylindrical coordinates , one of the jeans equations turns to identity .",
    "the jeans equations given in the latter form are convenient for our further calculations .    at this point",
    ", we have unknown functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the rotational velocity @xmath31 each being a function of both @xmath1 and @xmath5 , but only two jeans equations and the poisson s equation .",
    "this is not sufficient for solving the system .",
    "below we show that an expression for the shape and the tilt angle of the velocity ellipsoid can be derived from the theory of a third integral of motion and the resulting system is solvable .      in the solar neighbourhood ,",
    "none of the three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor are equal @xcite .",
    "this indicates that at least in the solar neighbourhood , beside the two classical energy and angular momentum integrals @xmath32 a third integral of motion has to exist .",
    "additionally , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have modelled galaxies with the schwarzschild orbit superposition method and showed that in elliptical galaxies a third , nonclassical integral exists .",
    "further arguments supporting the existence of a third integral were given in the introduction .",
    "we have chosen to use the third integral of motion in the form derived by @xcite .",
    "the aim of these papers was to gain the most general form for this integral .",
    "kuzmin started by assuming that it is a quadric function with respect to the velocities  otherwise too many restrictions for the potential would appear .",
    "his approach led to the following form for the third integral : @xmath33 the function @xmath34 is related to the gravitational potential via relations @xmath35 in this case the velocity dispersion tensor is in the diagonal form in elliptical coordinates defined as @xmath36,\\\\      x_2 ^ 2&=&\\frac12[\\omega-\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - 4z^2z_0 ^ 2}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and the parameters @xmath38 correspond to the foci of coordinates @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath19 between the ellipsoid and the plane of the galaxy is given as @xmath40 i.e. is determined by the @xmath41 value .     and @xmath42 ) and the tilt angle @xmath19 of the dispersion tensor in a meridional plane of galaxy .",
    "the foci of coordinates are marked with @xmath38 .",
    "a velocity ellipsoid is shown with the thick blue line .",
    "the galaxy plane is parallel with @xmath1 coordinates and is located at @xmath43 , galaxy centre is located at the origin of coordinates .",
    ", width=317 ]    now , the integrals of motion ( [ i1 ] )  ( [ i3 ] ) can be written as @xmath44 following @xcite , and assuming that the velocity distribution remains ellipsoidal , the phase density must be quadratic with respect to the velocities . thus the phase density must be a function of the integrals in the form of a combination @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the integrals of motion ( [ i11 ] )  ( [ i33 ] ) and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants .",
    "as the integrals of motions can be multiplied by arbitrary constants , we multiply all of them with @xmath53 , effectively taking @xmath54 , without loss of generality .",
    "this yields for the velocity dispersion ratios @xmath55 or the dispersion ratios in the cylindrical coordinate axes direction @xmath56 the asterisk @xmath57 denotes that the corresponding expressions are derived from the kuzmin s third integral of motion .",
    "now , instead of the four unknown functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 describing the velocity dispersion tensor , we have one unknown function , e.g. @xmath27 , and three unknown constants @xmath41 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "note that , assuming the third integral theory , the velocity ellipsoid is oriented along elliptical coordinates given with foci @xmath41 at every point of the galaxy .",
    "in general , if @xmath41 is a function of @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( i.e. the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid is not tied to fixed elliptical coordinates ) instead of being a constant , the third integral theory is only an approximation and the third integral is actually a quasi - integral .",
    "one way to solve the jeans equations in the case of triaxial velocity distribution was proposed by @xcite .",
    "kuzmin studied the third jeans equation in ellipsoidal coordinates . by choosing a suitable form for the dispersion ratio @xmath58 he derived an expression for @xmath59 or @xmath60 where integrations were made along hyperbolae expressed analytically in a simple form",
    "the first jeans equation can be solved in a similar way .",
    "@xcite solved the jeans equations for stckel - type potential . in this case",
    "the dispersion ratio @xmath61 has a simple form and the jeans equations can be represented as a system of four simple differential equations with partial derivatives .",
    "this system can also be solved with a method of characteristics but integration lines must be calculated numerically .    in the present paper we use a similar method .",
    "the two jeans equations form a system as both equations contain variable @xmath62 and derivatives with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , by using the kuzmin third integral form and an assumption that velocity distribution remains ellipsoidal , we may specify expressions for the velocity ellipsoid parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath19 ( see eqs .  , and ) .",
    "this allows us to solve the jeans equations ( [ jeanseq1 ] ) and ( [ jeanseq2 ] ) with the method of characteristics ( see appendix [ sec : the_solving ] for details ) .",
    "resulting expressions for dispersions @xmath3 and @xmath64 are @xmath65 where the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are denoted as @xmath68 and integration goes along the characteristic curves .",
    "again , the asterisks ( also in @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) denote that the variables are calculated based on the kuzmin third integral approximation .",
    "we introduce also a function @xmath71 defined as @xmath72 function @xmath73 can be constrained by observations ( e.g. using data from the gaia mission in the near future , by comparing the rotation of a test population of objects with rotation velocities of the thin gas disc ) .    in principle , if we know the free parameters ( @xmath50 , @xmath52 and @xmath41 ) , we can use either one of the jeans equations to calculate all the kinematical variables ( see below ) .",
    "the overall result must not depend on which jeans equation to use .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the free parameters and need a way to constrain them .",
    "we use the before mentioned condition , that for a correct set of free parameters , the jeans equations must yield concordant velocity dispersions : we calculate the radial velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 ) from the first jeans equation and the vertical velocity dispersion ( @xmath29 ) from the second one . using the shape of the velocity ellipsoid ( @xmath74 ) that was used in the jeans equations , we can check whether the found dispersions are consistent @xmath75 this equation ( or an equivalent equation @xmath76 ) turns into identity only if the jeans equations and the third integral of motion are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "this gives a way to find the free parameters in the model .",
    "it is implemented by constructing a cost function @xmath77 ^ 2\\mathrm{d}r\\mathrm{d}z\\ ] ] and minimising it .",
    "alternatively , more elaborate matching techniques can be used . if @xmath78 , then the solution is exact , otherwise it is only an approximation .",
    "we would like to stress that the kuzmin third integral form is not the only possible one and it does not have to be necessarily exact for a galaxy with complicated overall density distribution .",
    "thus it is possible that the jeans equations and the third integral of motion will not match perfectly . for practical exercises ,",
    "one can still use the method , but must bear in mind that to some extent , the results would slightly depend on whether one calculates kinematics based on @xmath3 or @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rot.curve ] ) .",
    "once the value for either @xmath3 or @xmath64 has been found , the other components can be calculated using the third integral approximation .",
    "the formulae for other components of @xmath3 based kinematics are @xmath79 , @xmath80 and in the case of @xmath64 based kinematics @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the tilt of the ellipsoid comes from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma.def ] ) .",
    "the non - tilted velocity ellipsoid parameters can be found with the following equations : @xmath83 in the case of @xmath84 , there is a 0/0 indetermination and the non - tilted ellipsoid parameters can be found using the dispersion ratio @xmath85 .",
    "observationally , we measure the line - of - sight velocity component of stellar velocities . ignoring the effects of light absorption and scattering by the interstellar dust ( a good approximation for older stellar systems ) , the stellar populations of galaxies can be considered transparent , thus the spectral lines contain the contribution of all stars along a given line of sight .",
    "therefore , to be comparable with observational data of actual galaxies , we need to project the modelled velocity distribution ( both @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) to the viewing direction and integrate along the line of sight through the entire galaxy .",
    "our model gives velocity dispersions along the cylindrical coordinate axes , thus a simple coordinate rotation is needed to compute the dispersion in the line of sight direction .",
    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 be distances along the major and minor axes of the plane - of - the - sky projection of the galaxy , respectively , and @xmath90 denote the inclination angle , defined as the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight ( @xmath91 corresponds to an edge - on galaxy ) .",
    "in order to find the velocity dispersion along a sightline , the most simple way is to find the non - tilted dispersion tensor shape and project the value of the velocity ellipsoid to the line of sight .",
    "once the ellipsoidal coordinate - aligned ellipsoid is found , one can get the line - of - sight projection @xmath92 using : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the angle in the meridional plane toward the projected observer direction , which is a combination of the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid and the angle between the line of sight and the cylindrical coordinate set .",
    "similarly , we need to extract the line - of - sight component from the rotational velocity @xmath86 : @xmath95    the observed spectral line shape at a given point in the plane of the sky ( @xmath96 ) effectively forms as the luminosity - weighted sum of the velocity distributions of each location along the corresponding line of sight .",
    "this velocity distribution @xmath97 along a given line of sight can thus be calculated as : @xmath98 , \\sigma_\\mathrm{los}[r'(z ) , z]\\ } \\cdot\\\\\\cdot \\frac{\\rho[r'(z ) , z]}{\\upsilon}\\frac{1}{\\cos{\\delta}}\\mathrm{d}z,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is a function linking @xmath5 and @xmath1 coordinates at each point along the sightline , @xmath100 denotes the normal distribution , and @xmath101 the mass - to - light ratio of the galaxy component .    for galaxy models with multiple components ( a bulge , a disc , etc .",
    ") , @xmath102 must be summed over components @xmath103 to compare the resulting line - of - sight velocity distributions with observations , one needs to approximate the @xmath104 values with normal or gauss - hermite profiles .",
    "to verify the applicability of the model described in the previous section , we apply the model on the well - studied nearby galaxy m31 . in @xcite , the mass distribution of m31",
    "is approximated with a usual three - component model : stellar bulge + stellar disc + dark matter halo .",
    "the parameters of the stellar components in the latter model were found by fitting dust - corrected surface brightness distributions and assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio for each component .",
    "dark matter density distribution is estimated by subtracting the stellar mass contribution from the observed gas rotation curve and the enclosed mass estimates in the outer regions .",
    "it is important to notice that for the referred mass distribution model construction , no stellar kinematics ( neither rotation velocity nor velocity dispersion ) information is used . as a consequence ,",
    "the mass distribution derivation is independent of the observed stellar kinematics .",

    "a good match between the corresponding distributions would mean that the model assumptions work well and the third integral holds .",
    "a not so good match would mean that either the kuzmin third integral can only be an approximation , ( i.e. it is a quasi - integral ) , or hint that the system is only close to equilibrium . in either interpretation",
    ", there is a question whether the solution describes the real galaxy , and results must be used with precaution . in the current case , the dispersions @xmath3 and @xmath105 in the bulge component",
    "are in a good agreement . for the disc component",

    "however , integration along the line of sight suppresses these deviations significantly ( black and grey lines in fig .  [ fig : rot.curve ] ) .",
    "as these lines are very close , we conclude , that the approximation is adequate .    in general ,",

    "in this paper we constructed a dynamical galaxy model in which the kinematics is calculated from the jeans equations , taking into account the theory of a third integral of motions .",
    "we assumed that the integral is in the form described by @xcite .",
    "the model can be used by fixing the mass distribution of a galaxy on the basis of observed surface brightness distribution and measurements of the gas rotation curve or from stellar spectra and chemical evolution models ; the remaining free parameters can be fitted so that the consistency of the jeans equations with the third integral is highest . if a satisfactory consistency can not be achieved ( as in the case of m31 disc ) ,",
    "there can be two explanations : either the integral is not suitable for the given density distribution , or one model assumption(s )",
    "is(are ) not strictly valid . as an example",
    ", a galaxy may be only in a quasi - equilibrium state . in these cases",

    "the model was built in a general way that allows to calculate the kinematics at any location within the galaxy .",
    "one feature of the model is the possibility to estimate the shape and inclination of the velocity dispersion ellipsoid in the framework of the third integral theory . in general , the third integral can be solved directly only near to the plane of a galaxy , hence the presented model also extends the usage of the third integral theory further , to regions off the galaxy plane .",
    "we tested our model on the nearby galaxy m31 , taking the density distribution from @xcite and constraining the model using the observed stellar rotation curve along the major axis .",
    "the calculated stellar rotation and velocity dispersions reproduce the actual measurements across the entire galaxy very well , suggesting that the third integral of motion can be used to model the dynamics of m31 .",

    "however , for the galaxy as a whole , i.e. a superposition of the bulge and the disc , no single ellipsoidal coordinate system describing the orientation of the velocity dispersion ellipsoids exists  the coordinate system takes a more complicated form . the weighted average of the parameter @xmath114 is constant in regions where either the bulge or the disc dominates , but is a function of coordinates @xmath115 in the transition region .",
    "thus , for a galaxy as a whole the third integral is actually a quasi - integral .",
    "we saw from fig .",
    "[ fig : disp.match ] ( right panel , blue lines ) that @xmath116 calculated from two jeans equations do not match exactly and disagreement increases with @xmath5 .",
    "one way to explain the inconsistency between two equations is to accept that a galaxy is in a quasi - equilibrium state and secular evolution due to fluctuating part of the gravitational potential ( irregular forces ) .",
    "an assumption in jeans equations is that there is no systematic motion in @xmath1 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "however , when studying the secular evolution of a stellar system due to irregular forces @xcite derived that in addition to other effects irregular forces cause certain systematic motion in @xmath5 direction being proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "we intend to study this possibility in the future .",
    "we can also draw some conclusions about the velocity ellipsoid in general , relying on m31 as a typical spiral galaxy with its distinct bulge and disc regions .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is approximately isotropic in the central parts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : disp.radial ] ) , which allows to use simpler models to describe the dynamics in the bulge region . in the outer regions where disc dynamics dominates",
    ", the velocity ellipsoid flattens slightly in the @xmath5-direction .    in our model , the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid",
    "is determined by the third integral of motion , which requires that the ellipsoid is oriented along the elliptical coordinate axes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orient ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the velocity ellipsoid can be assumed to be aligned with the cylindrical coordinate axes , as used in @xcite . according to our model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orient ] ) , the latter assumption is a good approximation only in the central part of the galaxy , where the ellipsoid is roughly spherical and does not have any distinctive orientation .",
    "the full advantage of the presented model can be taken if applied to large integral field spectroscopic surveys .",
    "several such surveys are in progress or planned , for example sauron @xcite , califa @xcite , manga @xcite , tkrs2 @xcite and hector @xcite .",
    "we plan to adapt our model to apply it to such larger surveys in the foreseeable future , opening a good opportunity to study the dynamics of a representative set of galaxies and to validate the broader applicability of the third integral of motion .",
    "we acknowledge the support by the estonian research council grants iut26 - 2 , iut40 - 2 , iut2 - 27 , and by the european regional development fund ( tk133 ) .",
