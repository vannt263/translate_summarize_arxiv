    "in the search to find systems with large thermoelectric figures of merit @xmath0 , the emphasis has been more on new materials than on materials structures or crystallographic anisotropy .",

    "the `` highest conductivity '' assumption is found to be correct for materials having simple band structures typically of the parabolic variety and essentially isotropic lattice thermal conductivities .",

    "there are also several surprising results .",
    "these include the formation of possibly large induced transverse electric fields and temperature gradients , the fact that @xmath0 is strictly isotropic in anisotropic systems having parabolic bands if the lattice thermal conductivity is neglected , and that a nearly isotropic thermopower and lorentz number results under these conditions even if the bands are extremely anisotropic and non - parabolic .    the macroscopic formalism , based on the tensorial form of the usual phenomenological transport equations , is presented in sec .  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "the effects of sample boundaries are included by requiring that the transverse electric and heat currents vanish at the transverse surfaces .",
