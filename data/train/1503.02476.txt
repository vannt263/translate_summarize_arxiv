    "the existence of a thin methane ice cloud in the atmosphere of uranus was inferred by @xcite , henceforth referred to as * l87 * , from their analysis of voyager 2 radio occultation measurements .",
    "they also derived a suite of temperature and methane profiles that were all consistent with their measurements , including model f , which had the greatest deep methane mixing ratio ( 4% ) , and their preferred model d , which had a deep mixing ratio of 2.3% and an above - cloud relative humidity of 30% .",
    "( here we use the term relative humidity of methane to refer to the ratio of its partial pressure to its saturation pressure at the same temperature , and the mixing ratio referred to is the volume mixing ratio or vmr . ) a methane cloud layer near the 1.2-bar level inferred by l87 has been used successfully in the analysis of observations in the visible spectral range .",
    "for example , @xcite incorporated a methane cloud layer into their models of voyager 2 imaging observations , finding modest optical depths of 0.66@xmath00.18 at 22s ( assumed to be independent of wavelength ) , and about three times that level at 65 s , while assuming a deep methane mixing ratio of 4% ( consistent with l87 model f ) . on the other hand , an analysis of hydrogen s(0 ) and s(1 )",
    "quadrupole line features by @xcite , which also incorporated a methane cloud near 1.2 bars , found its opacity ( weighted to high latitudes ) to be about 0.4 at 0.6 , while inferring a deep methane mixing ratio of 1.6% .",
    "neither of these authors tried to constrain the pressure of the cloud , however , so that consistency with occultation results was not fully established .",
    "recently , a serious challenge to the existence of the methane cloud layer was made by @xcite , henceforth referred to as * kt2009 * , based on their analysis of spatially resolved 0.3 - 1 spectra obtained from 2002 observations by the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "they concluded that the most significant cloud opacity concentration was in a layer from 1.2 - 2 bars , with particles uniformly mixed with the gas in this layer , which had wavelength - independent optical depths between 1.2 and 2.2 .",
    "they argued for no localized condensation layer at all , but instead for the existence of a global thick and diffuse tropospheric haze similar to that observed on titan .",
    "this seemed to confirm the analysis of near - ir spectral observations , which had already questioned the existence of a methane ice cloud near 1.2 bars .    from an analysis of the @xcite near - ir spectrum , which made use of improved methane absorption coefficients @xcite",
    ", @xcite obtained a cloud layer near 2 bars for the l87 model d profiles and at 1.5 - 1.7 bars for their model f profiles .",
    "a subsequent analysis of 2004 near - ir imaging observations by @xcite concluded that the methane relative humidity should be near 60%-100% above the nominal cloud region ( models d and f had 30% and 53% respectively ) , and at low latitudes found no need for a cloud layer in the 1.2 - 2 bar region .",
    "further refinements of methane absorption models for the near - ir @xcite did not entirely fix these discrepancies .",
    "@xcite used these improved methane coefficients and the l87 model d t(p ) profile and above - cloud methane mixing ratio , but used 1.6% instead of 2.26% below the putative cloud layer .",
    "with these assumptions they obtained a low - latitude cloud density peak near 2.5 bars . even using the l87 model f t(p ) profile and a 4% deep methane vmr",
    ", @xcite still obtained a cloud peak that was too deep to reach the methane condensation level , though the cloud pressure was then elevated to about the 1.7-bar level , which puts the peak in the middle of the main aerosol layer of kt2009 .",
    "more methane seems to be required to bring the cloud pressure inferred from spectral observations to the same level as inferred from the refractivity profile .",
    "however , according to l87 , their model f is an upper limit on methane amounts , and they argued that model d is really preferable .",
    "that solution has a deep methane mixing ratio of 2.3% by volume , a cloud layer between 1.15 and 1.27 bars , and an above - cloud methane humidity of 30% .",
    "other profiles that satisfy the occultation measurements have deep methane mixing ratios varying from zero to 4% , and above - cloud humidities varying from zero to 53% , while the in - cloud humidities vary from zero to 78% .",
    "model d was preferred for three reasons : ( 1 ) it provides the best agreement with iris observations sampling the above - cloud region , ( 2 ) it has the highest in - cloud humidity levels , ( 3 ) it yields a deep mixing ratio ( 2.3% ) that is in close agreement with that of @xcite .",
    "the first reason is weak because the iris observations in question @xcite are at a large zenith angle and rather uncertain .",
    "the second is weakened by the fact that only the nominal helium volume mixing ratio was considered , and that can strongly affect the methane humidity , as we will show here .",
    "the third reason is questionable because the orton et al .",
    "temperature profile derived assuming 2% methane does not agree with the occultation profile using virtually the same mixing ratio .",
    "much stronger external constraints are available from spectral observations in the ccd ( @xmath10.3 - 1 ) wavelength region , as shown by kt2009 and by the analysis presented here . in prior use of these spectral constraints",
    "however , there has been an unjustified deviation from occultation constraints in both thermal and methane profiles , in which a thermal profile derived for one methane profile is used for a very different mixing ratio @xcite and above - cloud methane profiles have been used that exceed all of the occultation solutions , e.g. kt2009 and @xcite .",
    "kt2009 also inferred that the methane mixing ratio varies with latitude , which raises additional questions about the effects of corresponding density variations with latitude .    to summarize , where spectral observations have been used to test the location of cloud layers on uranus , the inferred locations are considerably deeper than implied by the occultation observations . and",
    "the spectral constraints on the methane mixing ratio range from a low of 1.6@xmath2% by @xcite to 4% by @xcite , and include latitude dependent values between these values inferred by kt2009 .",
    "further , with the exception of rages et al . , prior modelers have not followed the occultation constraints on the the vertical distribution of methane .",
    "this motivates our efforts to redo the occultation analysis with consideration of a wider range of solutions , and to examine more carefully the plausibility of a compact methane cloud layer on uranus .    in the following ,",
    "we pursue the point of view that the occultation measurements of sudden slope changes in refractivity do indicate a region of sudden changes in methane mixing ratio , which are indicative of the condensation level of methane , and possibly of a thin region containing cloud particles .",
    "we describe a reanalysis of the occultation measurements that can actually achieve saturated vapor pressures in the same region as the sudden changes in refractivity slope .",
    "we also find solutions with high methane amounts at and above the cloud level that are consistent with the adopted profile of kt2009 . after finding a range of solutions with the desired characteristics",
    ", we then constrain these solutions by calculating spectra for compact cloud layer models and comparing the pressures inferred from matching spectra to the pressures inferred from the occultation analysis .",
    "we conclude that a methane cloud layer at the occultation pressure is consistent with the spectral observations , but that most of the cloud opacity is concentrated in a deeper layer that was not detected by the occultation measurements .",
    "we also confirm the conclusions of kt2009 that the methane is strongly depleted at high latitudes , but to shallow depths .",
    "we first describe the basic methods of analysis , how we reconstruct the refractivity profile , then use that profile to validate our methane retrieval methods by comparison with results of l87 .",
    "the occultation measurements , after accounting for observing geometry , can be reduced to refractivity as a function of altitude , where refractivity is defined to be @xmath3index of refraction -1)@xmath4 .",
    "if the molecular composition is known , then refractivity can be converted to number density and mass density .",
    "the pressure can then be determined by integrating the product of mass density and gravity , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium . from pressure and density , the equation of state of the gas",
    "can then be used to infer temperature .",
    "the main complication is that the variable distribution of methane is not known and can not be directly inferred from the observations .",
    "this allows a range of t(p ) solutions that depend on what is assumed about the methane distribution .",
    "the procedure followed by l87 was to first select a molecular weight that yielded a thermal profile near the tropopause that was consistent with iris thermal infrared observations .",
    "the only significant constituents at that level of the atmosphere are hydrogen and helium , so that the molecular weight was determined by their ratio , which was taken to be the @xcite value of he / h@xmath5=15/85 .",
    "l87 did not consider other he / h@xmath5 ratios , even though the quoted uncertainty is large enough to permit substantially different profiles , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : vmrvar ] .",
    "the next step in the procedure was to select altitudes bounding the cloud layer .",
    "these altitudes were not stated by l87 , but are approximately between 5 and 7 km below the 1 bar level determined for the d model .",
    "these are the rough locations of the rapid changes in refractivity slope .",
    "while the altitude relative to the center of the planet is fixed for all the profile solutions , the pressure varies somewhat from one solution to the next , so that the altitude above the 1 bar level also varies slightly .    to constrain the methane profile l87",
    "generally assumed a constant relative methane humidity above the cloud layer and used the tropopause mixing ratio to set the constant stratospheric mixing ratio . within the cloud region , l87 state that the temperature lapse rate was set equal to the wet adiabatic lapse rate , and adjusted the number density and temperature to match the refractivity profile .",
    "however , the model d @xmath6 profile of l87 does not match the wet adiabat within the assumed cloud layer . instead , the profile matches a weighted average of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the relative humidity .",
    "this weighted average is consistent with the suggestion that the occultation sampled a broad horizontal region in which the average humidity was less than expected for a uniform cloud layer .",
    "that is also offered as an explanation for the sub - saturated humidity levels that were obtained in the cloud layer .",
    "the relatively smooth i / f profiles observed on uranus @xcite are rarely disturbed by discernible discrete features , especially at low latitudes , and thus this explanation is not a compelling one .",
    "l87 also introduced a condensed fraction of the methane within the putative cloud layer , but did not publish the inferred values , nor how these values were constrained .",
    "if the temperature profile is constrained to follow the wet adiabat ( or the weighted average of wet and dry adiabats given above ) then the only remaining variable that needs to be adjusted is the fraction of total methane .",
    "there is no need to partition a fraction of the total into condensed form unless leaving the total in gaseous form would lead to supersaturation . in the latter case",
    ", it is reasonable to treat the excess vapor as condensed material .",
    "however , it is not reasonable to allow more than a tiny fraction of the methane to be in condensed form .",
    "the condensed fractions reaching 10% or so that are noted by l87 are grossly inconsistent with near - ir and ccd spectral constraints because those constraints permit only a low opacity cloud layer",
    ".    even a few percent of methane in condensed form would lead to extremely large optical depths at the cloud layer , which would provide very obvious spectral signatures that are not seen .",
    "models of near - ir and visible spectra require only small optical depths , typically unity or less at visible wavelengths . when treated as mie particles the inferred particle size of a compact cloud near 1.2 bars is of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "the total mass per unit area for a given optical depth @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the density of solid methane and @xmath13 is the extinction efficiency .",
    "assuming @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 g/@xmath17 @xcite , the mass density is 6.7@xmath18 g/@xmath19 .",
    "this is a factor of 300,000 times smaller than the typical 20 g/@xmath19 of total gaseous methane within the cloud layer .",
    "spectral constraints thus require that the condensed fraction must be so small as to play an insignificant role in the refractivity profile .",
    "while a @xmath6 solution consistent with the refractivity measurements is possible with no methane at all in the atmosphere ( model a of l87 ) , this was rejected because methane clearly plays a major role in shaping the spectrum of uranus . as the mixing ratio above the cloud is increased , the inferred temperature must increase to maintain the observed refractivity , and so does the methane mixing ratio inferred for the deep atmosphere .",
    "the maximum cloud - top humidity inferred by l87 is 53% , which leads to a deep mixing ratio of 4% , although this solution did not yield the highest humidity level within the cloud layer . trying to increase the above - cloud humidity any further results in rapidly increasing temperatures into the cloud layer and unacceptable superadiabatic lapse rates .",
    "none of these profiles yield anything close to saturation at the altitudes where cloud condensation is suspected .      with the aim of conducting a reanalysis of the occultation profile with different assumptions",
    ", we first needed to create a detailed refractivity profile .",
    "we began with the tabulation of p , t , molecular weight , number density , and mixing ratio published by l87 .",
    "we used refractivity values per molecule of @xmath20= 0.5062 , @xmath21 = 0.1302 , and @xmath22=1.629 ( all in units of 10@xmath23 @xmath24 ) , which are the same as those used by l87 and referenced therein .",
    "we then used the relation @xmath25 to compute the mean molecular refractivity , where subscripted @xmath26 values denote numeric fractions for each molecule .",
    "we also used the same 15/85 ratio of he to h@xmath5 as l87 .",
    "the total refractivity for the mixture is then given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total number density at altitude @xmath29 .",
    "our computed refractivity profile versus altitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : refracprof ] .        to validate that the refractivity profile we computed was consistent with the temperature profile , we inverted the profile as follows .",
    "we computed the pressure vs altitude under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium using @xmath30 where m(z ) is the molecular weight in grams per mole , @xmath31 is avogadro s number , and @xmath32 is the gravitational acceleration as a function of altitude , which varies from 8.6843 m / s@xmath33 at 1 bar ( 0 km ) to 8.5157 m / s@xmath33 at 240 km , assuming a retrograde wind of 100 m / s @xcite , which reduces @xmath34 by only 0.23% and could be ignored .",
    "we started the downward integration at 240 km above the 1-bar level , and took the starting pressure to be 2.5@xmath35 bar to match the stratospheric profile of l87 .",
    "( the specific value of @xmath36 has an insignificant effect on the structure for pressures greater than a few hundred millibars . )",
    "assuming an ideal gas equation of state we then computed @xmath6 from pressure and number density .",
    "our @xmath6 profile thus constructed is compared with the l87 profile in fig.[fig : tpvalidation ] , where we see that differences below the tropopause are generally smaller than 0.1(the rms deviation is 0.07 k ) .",
    "this provides a reasonable validation of our reconstructed refractivity profile , which we will reanalyze with different assumptions in a subsequent section , after first validating our methane retrieval procedure .",
    "profile derived from refractivity profile of fig .",
    "[ fig : refracprof ] ( solid ) using l87 tabulated results , and the l87 model d profile ( symbols ) .",
    "b : the difference profile.,width=307 ]      we next tried to reproduce the methane profile retrievals obtained by l87 .",
    "we started with the refractivity profile , the assumed he / h@xmath5 ratio of 15/85 , selected altitudes for the cloudy layer , and selected a constant relative humidity above the cloud layer up to the tropopause , and above the tropopause assumed a constant methane mixing ratio equal to the tropopause value , although later we used the 10@xmath37 upper limit of @xcite . within the cloud layer we forced the lapse rate to agree with eq .",
    "[ eq : lapse ] .",
    "we then started at the top of the atmosphere and integrated downward the number density and pressure and iteratively solving for @xmath38 and @xmath28 under the constraints of the specified methane humidity above the cloud , the constraints of the temperature lapse rate within the cloud , and the fixed mixing ratio below the cloud , which was taken to be the mixing ratio at the bottom of the cloud layer .",
    "our attempt to reproduce the model d solution is displayed in fig.[fig : dinversion ] . in most respects our results",
    "are barely distinguishable from those of l87 .",
    "we obtain a deep vmr of 2.22% compared to their value of 2.26% , and our maximum rh at the cloud base is 79.2% compared to their 78% .",
    "these might be brought into better agreement with slightly different choices for the cloud boundaries .",
    "we did not assign any of the methane fraction to condensed material ; we do nt know whether l87 did or not for this model .",
    "we take these comparisons to be adequate validation of our inversion technique .",
    "note that the @xmath6 and profiles of kt2009 , which are also plotted in fig.[fig : dinversion ] , have significantly higher temperatures and much more methane above the cloud top .",
    "if we increase the above cloud relative humidity as much as plausible , which we estimate to be about 57% ( instead of the 53% of l87 ) , we get results very close to the l87 model f profile . we obtained a deep vmr of 4.13% ( instead of 4% ) and a peak in - cloud humidity of 70% instead of 72% .",
    "the temperature profile is also close to the model f profile of l87 . even at this upper limit",
    ", however , the above cloud methane is well below what was adopted by kt2009 . pushing the methane values above this level results in physically unacceptable results : the in - cloud humidity becomes lower than the humidity above the cloud and the sub - cloud lapse rate becomes more and more unstable .",
    "we would argue that even this upper limit leads to physically implausible profiles because of the relatively low humidity in the cloud layer .",
    "yet good fits to the spectral observations seem to need even more methane at these levels . in the following section",
    "we show how these levels can be reached .",
    "now that we have validated our analysis techniques , we apply these techniques to obtain new solutions for temperature and methane profiles .",
    "we first revised the methane mixing ratio at the tropopause and throughout the stratosphere to equal the @xcite upper limit of 1@xmath18 , and used a variable relative humidity between the tropopause and the cloud top , using the formulation @xmath39 where a tropopause humidity @xmath40 of about 12% is needed to match the desired minimum methane vmr , and the tropopause height @xmath41 is taken to be 45 km .",
    "an exponent @xmath42=1 provides linear interpolation , and a decrease of humidity above the cloud top that is similar to that adopted by kt2009 .",
    "these changes made no significant difference in the plausible upper limit of methane mixing ratios in the vicinity of the cloud layer and in the deep atmosphere .",
    "we also tried adding neon to the atmosphere , using the mixing ratio of 0.0004 suggested by @xcite .",
    "this has a very small but undesirable effect that reduces the upper limit on methane .",
    "what is really needed is a lower background molecular weight , which then requires increased methane to match the refractivity profile .",
    "the only plausible way to obtain a lower molecular weight is to decrease the mixing ratio of he , which is what we proceeded to do in the following fashion . within the cloud layer we used the same formulation as given by eq .",
    "[ eq : lapse ] , but decreased the he vmr ( at all altitudes ) as needed to obtain methane condensation within most of the putative cloud layer .",
    "below the cloud layer we used the same methane mixing ratio as found at the bottom of the cloud layer .",
    "decreasing the he mixing ratio has two beneficial effects : it allows methane saturation mixing ratios to be attained within the layer where condensation is expected to occur , and it allows a higher maximum methane mixing ratio that is more likely to be consistent with near - ir and visible spectra of uranus .",
    "our first example solution ( model d1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : modeld2 ] ) uses a he vmr of 0.126 , and yields a saturated methane mixing ratio through the bottom half of the nominal cloud region , and a deep mixing ratio of 2.22% for an above - cloud humidity of 38% .",
    "this is similar to model d of l87 , but is more physically plausible .        a second example ( model f1 ) , which attains the same deep mixing ratio of model f ( 4% ) is shown in fig .  [ fig : modelf2 ] .",
    "this solution is notable in having much more methane above the cloud layer than model f , and provides a close match to the vmr profile adopted by kt2009 , although our corresponding @xmath6 profile is somewhat cooler than their adopted profile , as needed to match the refractivity profile .",
    "the he vmr for this solution is 0.1155 , which is only 1.05@xmath43 below the nominal value of 0.15@xmath00.033 , given by @xcite .",
    "our maximum methane solution ( our model g in table  [ tbl : strucsum ] ) is obtained for a he vmr of 0.1063 , which is only 1.3@xmath43 below the nominal value .",
    "this solution has an above - cloud humidity of 100% .",
    "this provides a deep vmr of 4.88% and even more methane above the cloud top than that adopted by kt2009 .",
    "a summary of the above model profiles and intermediate model ef is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : profcomp ] and detailed parameter information in table  [ tbl : strucsum ] .",
    "the small difference in tropopause temperatures ( at @xmath44 = 0.1 bar ) is due to the different helium mixing ratios used in each model .",
    "the maximum temperatures reached near @xmath44= 2.3 bars for our models d1-g are comparable to those obtained by l87 for their models c - f .",
    "we now have a range of solutions that are consistent with occultation results , as well as being consistent with the expectation that methane humidity levels should reach saturation levels in the putative condensation region , which is presumably the physical reason for the sudden change in refractivity slope .",
    "the remaining question is whether it is possible to fit the spectra of uranus with a cloud particle layer in the same pressure regime where occultation analysis implies a cloud layer .",
    "we first describe our chosen spectral constraints and radiation transfer and fitting methods , and then proceed to describe the results of applying the spectral constraints .",
    "we chose for our spectral comparisons the spatially resolved stis observations made on 19 august 2002 , as corrected and calibrated by kt2009 .",
    "these spectra are undoubtedly the most accurately calibrated and characterized spectra available for the purpose .",
    "the data provide two spatial dimensions , with a pixel size of 0.05 arc seconds on a side , providing 37 samples from center to limb , and one spectral dimension , which is sampled at 0.4-nm intervals , providing 1-nm resolution from 300 nm to 1000 nm .",
    "a sample image from this cube is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : specobs]a .",
    "these data provide a good view of the low latitude region sampled by the voyager radio occultation experiment , although some 16 years later , which is a delay of 20% of a uranus year .",
    "however , given the long radiative time constants in the uranus atmosphere @xcite , it is plausible to expect only small changes in cloud structure in low latitude regions . stability at low latitudes also seems to be compatible with the analysis of hst images from 1994 to 2000 @xcite , which indicate little change in albedo structure at these latitudes .",
    "in addition to spectral constraints , the kt2009 data provide important center - to - limb ( ctl ) information ( fig .  [",
    "fig : specobs]b ) . to reduce the effects of noise",
    ", we fit the center - to - limb scans to a smooth function of @xmath45 ( the cosine of the zenith angle ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : specobs]b for a planetocentric latitude of 5s .",
    "we then sampled that function at @xmath45 = 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.6 , and 0.8 .",
    "the resulting substantial noise reduction is readily apparent in the figure , where uncertainties are shown by roughly parallel dot - dash lines at 1@xmath43 limits .",
    "we were able to ignore the difference between solar and observer zenith angles because the stis observations were taken at a very small phase angle ( 0.04 ) .",
    "we also were able to ignore possible longitudinal variations in cloud structure because the discrete cloud features of uranus are generally so small and of such low contrast that they do not obscure the ctl information of the zonal bands .",
    "we also know from prior experience with differences between uranus images taken at substantially different central meridian longitudes that the only substantial longitudinal i / f variations are due to discrete features . at the few latitudes where discrete features were found in the stis",

    "though these declines may seem modest in the logarithmic plot , they are 7 - 10 times the typical 5% fitting uncertainty . the upper tropospheric haze reaches a peak opacity near the equator , as noted by kt2009 .    the prominent bright band near 45s that is observed in uranus images at wavelengths of intermediate absorption ( 0.1 - 0.4 /km - am , as shown in fig . 23 of kt2009 ) is also prominent in near - ir h- and j - band images , as in fig . 7 of @xcite . according to fig.[fig : latdep ] , this band is in a region where cloud pressures have increased in both of the upper compact layers while the upper tropospheric methane mixing ratio has decreased .",
    "it is clear that the upper compact layer at 45s and 60s can not be the putative methane ice layer , because the pressure levels are much too high to permit condensation .",
    "it is conceivable that in this region the upper tropospheric cloud is actually what we called the middle tropospheric cloud at low latitudes . and",
    "the much deeper second compact layer may be a new cloud layer formed by the upwelling produced by the lower circulation branch in fig .",
    "[ fig : methanecirc ] .",
    "this would suggest that the boundary between the upper and lower branches may be in the 1.5 - 1.7 bar region .",
    "the bright band contrast relative to 60s is a result of the deeper cloud being much deeper at 60s and having a much lower optical depth .",
    "the contrast relative to lower latitudes results from a combination of reduced methane opacity as well as the extra cloud opacity in the 2-bar region , which apparently more than compensates for the absence of the 1.2-bar cloud layer and the significantly reduced opacity at 1.5 bars . at 60s the middle tropospheric cloud reaches about the same pressure as @xcite inferred for the semi - infinite cloud in their model , which is heavily weighted towards high latitudes .    .",

    "because the occultation probes to higher pressures than the pressures we infer for the dominant middle tropospheric cloud , one might wonder why the occultation did not detect this layer if it is indeed compact and created by condensation ? that turns out not to be a contradiction .",
    "if the mixing ratio of the condensible is low enough , then the change in molecular weight might actually be very small , and the resulting refractivity change might be too small to be detected .",
    "for example , for h@xmath5s to form a cloud base near 1.7 bars its volume mixing ratio would need to be @xmath110@xmath105 ( @xmath10.003 times the solar mixing ratio ) . the maximum change in molecular weight induced by condensation of that much h@xmath5s",
    "would then be about 3@xmath106 , which would be completely undetectable in the occultation measurements , even if it occurred in a thin layer .",
    "but could such a cloud actually produce enough condensible material to produce the needed reflectivity of the cloud ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "if half the h@xmath5s gas in a 2-km thick layer were to condense into 1-droplets , we estimate that the resulting cloud would have about 1 optical depth . convective processing of additional gas could increase its opacity to much higher values .",
    "nh@xmath78 is a much less suitable candidate because its corresponding mixing ratio would be three orders of magnitude smaller as would the mass available for cloud particle formation .",
    "all our calculations described so far have assumed equilibrium hydrogen , for which the para and ortho fractions are in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "since these two forms of hydrogen have different spectral features , this assumption deserves some consideration .",
    "the equilibrium para faction for our f1 profile is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : parafractions ] , along with several non - equilibrium curves , which we discuss in the following . in the deep atmosphere",
    "high temperatures produce a para fraction of 0.25 ( referred to as normal hydrogen ) , but above the methane condensation level the para fraction increases dramatically . by vertically mixing deep atmospheric gas up to the cloud level and higher , a dramatic change in the para fraction",
    "can be produced , if done on a time scale short compared to the relaxation time .",
    "@xcite considered mixtures of equilibrium and normal hydrogen , as might be produced by vertical mixing of the high temperature para distribution with the locally equilibrated distribution .",
    "their results were consistent with mixtures that were no less than 85% equilibrium ( and thus 15% normal ) .",
    "kt2009 found that the difference between 100% and 85% equilibrium had a smaller effect than their uncertainties .",
    "they also stated that 50% equilibrium hydrogen would shift their results toward lower aerosol opacities and lower mixing ratios , but not change their results about latitudinal variations unless the the equilibrium fraction itself varied with latitude , which they argued against on the basis of smooth latitudinal variations in the observed hydrogen absorption regions .",
    "mixtures of equilibrium and normal hydrogen can not produce the very different para fraction profiles that can be produced by the descending or rising branches of our putative methane circulation . for convenience ,",
    "we parameterize the rising or descending gas by pfac , which is the factor by which pressure at the midpoint of the equilibrium profile is displaced . in fig .",
    "[ fig : parafractions]a , we show para fractions that result when gas is vertically transported upward ( pfac=0.5 ) or downward ( pfac=1.5 and pfac=3.0 ) , assuming that the transport time is much less than the relaxation time to reach local equilibrium .",
    "note that mixtures of equilibrium and normal hydrogen always decrease the para fraction , while vertical gas transport can dramatically increase or decrease the local para fraction .",
    "how changes in the para profile affect the uranus spectrum can be seen in fig.[fig : paraeffect ] for two profiles of the type shown in fig.[fig : parafractions]a : a descending gas case ( pfac=2.5 ) and an ascending gas case ( pfac=0.5 ) .",
    "the effect is local , mainly between 0.77 and 0.86 , and is roughly the same percentage over a wide range of view angles , reaching a maximum difference of about 15% . for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parafractions]b , where there is descending gas above 1.5 bars , and ascending gas below ( deeper than ) 1.5 bars , which is more consistent with high - latitude motions shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : methanecirc ] , the spectral difference from the equilibrium case is only a few percent , and not detectable within current uncertainties .",
    "the fact that we did not find evidence in the spectra for significantly altered para profiles is consistent with either such a combined upwelling / down - welling profile or no significant departure from equilibrium hydrogen .",
    "however , this issue may be worth further investigation , especially if methane absorption coefficients become better known .",
    "part of the problem making use of this constraint is that we are working with a part of the spectrum where methane absorption is weak and thus currently is significantly uncertain .",
    "the voyager infrared radiometer interferometer and spectrometer ( iris ) and radio science subsystem ( rss ) together yielded a determination of jupiter s he / h@xmath5 ratio equal to 0.114@xmath00.025 , which is a weighted mean of results by @xcite and @xcite . however , the in situ measurements of the galileo probe contradicted this value , instead obtaining 0.157@xmath00.004 @xcite and 0.156@xmath00.006 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reviewed possible explanations for this discrepancy and ruled out iris calibration errors , but were unable to identify any plausible error in the occultation measurements or analysis , although a detailed error analysis of the occultation measurements was not conducted .",
    "this discrepancy also cast suspicions on the very low he / h@xmath5 ratio obtained by iris - rss analysis for saturn , and led to an upward revision of the saturn ratio from 0.034@xmath00.024 to 0.11 - 0.16 , based on a rather uncertain iris - only analysis @xcite .",
    "this also raises questions about the occultation results for uranus , suggesting perhaps that the iris - rss determined ratio is actually too low for uranus , rather than our suggestion that the ratio is too high .",
    "but an even higher ratio , with the same refractivity profile would lead to very serious amplification of inconsistencies with near - ir and ccd spectra of uranus that have already been noted . furthermore , because the specific error that caused prior discrepancies is not known , it is not possible to predict with any confidence how it might affect the uranus analysis , or even what direction it might take . the change in refractivity per molecule that results from changing the he vmr from 0.15 to 0.11 , as computed from eq .",
    "[ eq : refrac ] is from 4.496@xmath107 /@xmath17 to 4.647@xmath107 /@xmath17 , which is a change of 3.3% .",
    "we do not know if an error of this magnitude is even remotely conceivable for the occultation measurements .",
    "the optical depth of the methane cloud is relatively small and the influence of the middle tropospheric cloud is much more significant because of its greater opacity .",
    "that and the limited vertical resolution inherent in all the spectral observations , will lead inversion methods such as the nemesis routine used in by irwin and colleagues @xcite to find peak opacity contributions at pressures deeper than that of the methane cloud .",
    "in addition , these and most prior modelers of near - ir spectra assumed profiles of methane with much smaller column amounts of methane , often by a factor of two or more ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ch4comp ] ) , which leads to much higher pressures for the level of significant aerosol scattering .",
    "the dependence of derived pressure on assumed methane was clearly demonstrated by @xcite and by @xcite . as noted previously , when irwin et al .",
    "switched from model d to the model f profile , the pressure of their peak opacity concentration moved from 2.5 to 1.7 bars .",
    "since our model f1 has more column abundance of methane down to the 1.2 bar level than even the l87 model f , we expect similar pressures would be obtained using our recommended profile .",
    "after reanalysis of the l87 radio occultation profiles of refractivity vs altitude , and fitting compact cloud layer models to stis spectra as corrected and calibrated by kt2009 , we reached the following main conclusions :    1 .   by decreasing the stratospheric he mixing ratio from its nominal value of 0.15 by 1 - 1.3 times its uncertainty it is possible to achieve methane saturation within the layers suspected to have condensation and to achieve increased methane humidities above the condensation level , even exceeding the high values adopted by kt2009 at low latitudes , which are inconsistent with the original l87 profiles .",
    "the maximum deep mixing ratio that we could obtain within reasonable physical constraints was 4.88% ( for our model g ) .",
    "a five - layer cloud model in which the bottom two diffuse layers of the kt2009 model are split into three compact layers , when constrained by stis spectra at 5s , yield best - fit pressures for the top compact layer in excellent agreement with the location of the occultation cloud layer for profile models with deep mixing ratios between 3.2 and 4.5% , with the best compromise fit being obtained at 4% ( for our model f1 ) , although this fit is not significantly better than for the other models in this range .",
    "3 .   as judged by fitting errors at 0.825 , where",
    "h@xmath5 cia exceeds methane absorption , the best compatibility between methane and h@xmath5 cia is obtained for a methane mixing ratio of 4.5% with an uncertainty range of about 0.7% .",
    "when we consider constraints of upper cloud pressure , fit error at 0.825 , overall fit quality , and the uncertainty limits of the @xcite helium abundance , our best compromise estimate for the deep methane mixing ratio at 5s is 4.0@xmath00.5% , and the corresponding preferred vertical temperature and methane profiles are embodied in our f1 model .",
    "our five - layer cloud model , using the ef and/or f1 profiles , can also provide excellent fits between latitudes of 30s and 20n , with relatively latitude - independent cloud pressure boundaries , but generally decreasing optical depths from south to north .",
    "the main exception is the upper tropospheric haze , which shows a strong peak near the equator , as noted by kt2009 .",
    "the lower tropospheric cloud is found to have the greatest opacity , but the 1 - 2 optical depth ( at 0.5 ) middle tropospheric cloud ( in 1.5 - 1.7 bar range ) has the most significant effect on the observed ccd spectrum .",
    "the pressure of the 0.15 - 0.3 optical depth methane cloud layer did not vary much with latitude , staying within 2% of its 1.2 bar mean .",
    "6 .   trying to fit our model at high southern latitudes made it clear that the methane mixing ratio profile could not remain the same as we used in the low latitude observations .",
    "not only did overall fit quality deteriorate , but the fit quality at 0.825 wavelength of h@xmath5 cia got suddenly very bad , and the direction and size of the error at that wavelength indicated a significant lowering of the methane mixing ratio , as first pointed out by kt2009 .",
    "we created depleted methane profiles in which depletions reached a limited depth at which point the mixing ratio transitioned to the same deep value of 4% used at low latitudes .",
    "we did not expect a depletion at great depths because the horizontal density gradients that would be generated would induce problematic vertical wind shears .",
    "overall and 0.825 fit quality was found to be minimized with mixing ratios less than 1% and depletion depths of 3 - 4 bars at 60s and only 1.5 - 2 bars at 45 s. 8 .",
    "creating the observed methane depletion is plausibly the result of upwelling at low latitudes , where the uranus atmosphere is dried out by condensation of cloud particles , and subsequent poleward transport to and descent of the dried - out atmosphere at high latitudes down to levels of a few bars , with greater descent nearer to the pole .",
    "this would inhibit methane condensation at high latitudes and perhaps help to explain the failure to detect any discrete cloud features from 45s to the south pole .",
    "the failure of modelers of near - ir spectra to detect a methane cloud at the proper location ( where the occultation found a sudden change is refractivity ) is due to two effects : one is that most modelers used mixing ratio profiles providing too little methane absorption and the other is that the methane cloud layer has a significantly lower opacity than the main cloud layer that peaks in the 1.4 - 1.7 bar region , making it hard to resolve its separate contribution .",
    "the failure of the occultation measurements to detect the deeper and more significant middle tropospheric cloud layer that so prominently affects both near - ir and ccd spectra is not at all surprising if it is created by condensibles at very low mixing ratios . in that case",
    "the condensation would not produce a detectable change in refractivity .",
    "although it is not possible for the stis spectra alone to clearly distinguish between vertically extended models , such as that of kt2009 , and compact layer models of the type we presented here , there is a strong distinction in physical processes involved .",
    "our model is consistent with cloud formation by condensation , while the kt2009 model presents a picture in which a vertically extended haze of stratospheric origin provides all the particulate opacity , much like the vertically extended haze on titan .",
    "we prefer the condensation model because it provides consistency with the occultation observations and provides a mechanism for depleting methane from the upper troposphere at high latitudes",
    ".    many of these results are dependent on models of methane absorption in spectral regions where absorption is relatively weak and somewhat uncertain .",
    "some of the absorption coefficients were adjusted by kt2009 to obtain better overall fits to the observations , which might tend to favor the particular models they were using in their analysis . as we obtain more accurate information about methane absorption that is independent of the spectral observations",
    "we are trying to interpret , these conclusions may need to be modified .",
    "the view of uranus north polar regions at the beginning of 2011 is now adequate to address an important issue with new observations .",
    "the issue is whether the depletion of methane observed at southern high latitudes is also present at northern high latitudes , and if not currently depleted , whether it will become depleted as uranus seasons proceed .",
    "there is some evidence suggesting high northern latitudes might not be depleted : discrete cloud features have been observed in 2007 keck images between 45n and 74n @xcite , while no discrete cloud features have been seen at corresponding southern latitudes .",
    "the lack of southern discrete features is correlated with the inferred descent of dry gas at those latitudes , suggesting that the descending gas and resulting methane depletion may not be present at high northern latitudes .",
    "the question of whether methane is currently depleted at high northern latitudes on uranus can be answered unequivocally by new stis spectral measurements .",
