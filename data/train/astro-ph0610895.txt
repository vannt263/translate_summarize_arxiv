    "recent observations of the he  ii ly@xmath2 forest show large spectral fluctuations on very small scales ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . due to the hard ionizing field required in the he  ii voids that is consistent with the integrated radiation of a surrounding quasar population",

    "observationally the spectral shape of the intergalactic uv radiation field can be described by the the column density ratio @xmath50 of the column densities of he  ii and h  i. theoretically @xmath51 for a hard spectrum dominated by quasars , whereas @xmath52 indicates an additional contribution from star - forming galaxies @xcite .    at the low resolution of the stis spectrum of q  0302@xmath0003",
    "the he  ii absorption remains unresolved and @xmath53 is not directly accessible .",
    "one can still estimate @xmath53 by comparing the actual he  ii spectrum with a simulated spectrum that is generated using the accurate h  i line parameters from high - resolution optical spectroscopy and a constant value for @xmath53 .",
    "we used the h  i line lists of @xcite and @xcite , which jointly cover the redshift range accessible with stis in he  ii ly@xmath2 and simulated the he  ii forest for different values of @xmath53 assuming pure non - thermal broadening of the lines .",
    "figure  [ diff_eta_asp ] shows the resulting he  ii spectra degraded to the stis resolution as the difference between the observed and the simulated spectrum for four representative values of @xmath53 .",

    "the vicinity of qso  c is reproduced with @xmath54 and from the soft radiation field in a nearby h  i void ( * ? ? ? * marked by db in fig .",
    "[ diff_eta_asp ] ) we argue that this void is created by large - scale structure and not by the quasar . @xcite found qso  a coinciding with a he  ii void after @xcite predicted a quasar at this redshift due to the inferred hard radiation field .",

    "we have found the transverse proximity effect as a local fluctuation in spectral hardness near four foreground quasars in the vicinity of q  0302@xmath0003 .",
    "so far , this effect has mostly been associated with the notion of voids in the ly@xmath2 forest due to the overionized zones around quasars near the line of sight .",
    "we argue that the relative uv hardness is a sensitive _ physical _ quantity to search for individual sources of the intergalactic uv radiation field going beyond the detection of quasars and voids that may be in fact unrelated .",
