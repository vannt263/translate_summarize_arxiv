    "in a classical molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulation , newton s equations of motion are solved for a many - particle system . nowadays , such md simulations allow to consider systems that contain generally between 10@xmath0 and several million particles  @xcite . depending on the number of particles , typical time scales covered by the simulation range between a nano - second and several micro - seconds . in a classical simulation",
    "the interactions between the particles are given by an effective potential function that does of course not take into account in an explicit manner the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "for simplicity and efficiency of the simulations , one often considers pairwise - additive interactions that depend only on the distance between pairs of particles .",
    "in fact , if one aims to reveal universal properties of , e.g. , supercooled melts or glasses @xcite , or if the goal is to check analytical theories that are based on simple interaction models , such pairwise - additive interaction potentials are the most useful choice .",
    "although experience shows that even simple pair potentials can provide a surprisingly realistic description of rather complex materials , there is at present no systematic approach that allows to obtain an effective two - body potential for a given material .",
    "an example for this is amorphous silica that forms a disordered tetrahedral network structure in which tetrahedral sio@xmath1 units are connected to each other _ via _ the oxygen atoms at the corner of each tetrahedron @xcite .",
    "although strong directional covalent si - o bonds are essential for the formation of the tetrahedral network structure , pair - interaction models such as the one proposed by van beest , kramer , and van santen ( bks ) @xcite do reproduce many static and dynamic properties of real silica ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    due to its importance for glass science as well as technology , intensive efforts",
    "have been undertaken in the past to investigate silica by means of classical md simulations . to this end",
    ", different effective interaction models have been proposed in an _ ad hoc _ manner and also a variety of fitting schemes have been proposed , aiming at a more systematic way to obtain effective potentials @xcite .",
    "the first effective potentials were mainly geared towards the description of the crystalline phases of silica , such as @xmath2-quartz and @xmath3-cristobalite and thus in some cases the functional ansatz for these potentials were specifically designed to reproduce the symmetric tetrahedral environment found in crystals .",
    "the parameters of these potentials were adjusted to reproduce some macroscopic experimental data such as elastic constants , or microscopic data such as lattice parameters .",
    "consequently these potentials reproduce by design such features , but give in fact very little considerations to the microscopic interactions while , ideally , an effective potential should describe at best the microscopic interactions and should consequently be able to describe and predict reliably macroscopic observables .    a significantly improved methodology has been proposed by tsuneyuki _",
    "et al . _ who derived a pair potential based on quantum calculations of the vibrational modes of a single si(oh)@xmath1 unit  @xcite .",
    "later , this potential was improved by bks @xcite using a similar approach but these authors included also information on bulk data . although the bks potential has been found to be surprisingly reliable for the description of many properties of amorphous silica ( see above ) , it has also shortcomings in that , _",
    "e.g. _  the equation of state @xcite and the vibrational density of state @xcite show relatively strong deviations from experimental data . that the fitting scheme , originally proposed by tsuneyuki",
    "_ et al . _ , leads to a good description of silica , is also somewhat accidental , since in general one can not expect that a quantum calculations of a single tetrahedral unit allows to obtain an effective interaction potential of a bulk material .",
    "although a similar methodology has also been successfully applied to geo@xmath4 @xcite , it is not obvious that it can be generalized to other oxides such as al@xmath4o@xmath5 and b@xmath4o@xmath5 or more complex systems such as borosilicates , alkali silicates , phosphates and fluorophosphate glasses which are of prime technological importance .",
    "it is evident that the idea to use _ ab initio _ data to obtain effective classical potentials is very appealing since _ ab initio _",
    "simulations allow , at least in principle , to obtain the properties of any material .",
    "in such simulations one describes the ion cores as classical particles and the electronic degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically within the framework of a density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "simulations are nowadays routinely done for systems of 100 to 300 atoms on a time scale of several tens of picoseconds  @xcite .",
    "they allow to study systems in a well - defined thermodynamic ensemble , with the full information of the trajectories of all the ions in the system . from this information it is thus in principle possible to obtain effective potentials . in practice , however , it is not really feasible to integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom and thus to determine an exact effective potential function from the _ ab initio _ trajectories . hence , one usually makes an ansatz for an effective potential that contains a number of free parameters",
    ". then these parameters are adjusted by a fitting procedure such that the optimal agreement between the _ ab initio _ data and classical md calculations is obtained .",
    "the ansatz one chooses for the effective potential will depend on the nature of the system under consideration and often this choice is based on physical intuition . as mentioned above , systems such as silica can be described quite well by two - body potentials , such as the aforementioned bks model for silica which consists of long - ranged coulomb and short ranged buckingham terms @xcite , with the latter describing the attractive and repulsive interactions between the ion cores on length scales of  2 - 8   .",
    "once one has decided on the functional form of the potential one has to address the problem on how to fit the free parameters of this function to obtain an optimal reproduction of the _ ab initio _ data .",
    "this is of course a highly non - trivial task because one is confronted with a high - dimensional fitting problem since the potential of even the simplest systems will have on the order of 10 - 20 parameters that have to be determined .",
    "one must expect that the cost function that one optimizes ( see below ) will have many local minima in parameter space and thus there is the risk to be trapped in one of these and hence to not find the optimal set of parameters .",
    "in addition , one has to keep in mind that the ansatz in terms of two - body or even three- or four - body interactions neglects higher - order many - body interactions , required to exactly describe the effective interactions between the ion cores . as a consequence ,",
    "the cost function has to be chosen such that the _ relevant physical properties _ of the system are reproduced in simulations with the resulting effective potential .",
    "thus , the choice of the cost function and its minimization are crucial to parameterise the potential such that it leads to a reliable description of the system under consideration .    in the present work ,",
    "we compare two different approaches to determine the parameters of effective pair potentials .",
    "the system considered is amorphous silica ( sio@xmath4 ) and the _ ab initio _ data has been obtained from a car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) simulation @xcite .",
    "( in the following we refer to these simulations as cpmd simulations ) . as an ansatz for the functional form of the three pair potentials that describe the o - o , si - si , and si - o interactions",
    ", we use a combination of coulomb and buckingham terms , i.e.  the same functional form as in the bks model .",
    "this choice for the form of the potential is motivated by the fact that the bks potential does give a good description of many properties of silica and hence it can serve as a reference on what can be achieved by this simple functional form .",
    "we do , however , of course not exclude the possibility that other type of pair potentials will give an even better description of this material .",
    "the first approach we will use for finding the optimal parameters is the so - called `` force - matching method '' , proposed by ercolessi and adams @xcite . in that approach",
    ", the parameters of the effective potential are optimized such that the resulting force on each particle matches as closely as possible the one obtained from the _ ab initio _ simulation .",
    "below we will show that if one uses the parameters of the bks model as start parameters for the fitting , one does indeed find an effective potential that gives a very good description of these forces .",
    "however , we show that the structure resulting from the force matching procedure gives only a very bad description of silica and is in fact much worse than the bks model .",
    "this becomes , e.g. , evident if one uses this potential to calculate structural quantities such as the pair correlation or angular distribution functions , and compares them with those from the cpmd simulation .",
    "the second approach that we consider for optimizing the parameters uses as input the structural data from the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations , notably the pair correlation function .",
    "this method has been applied in the past to obtain a reliable potential for silica  @xcite . here , we extend this work and clarify why the structure matching method leads to a much better model than the force - matching method , at least in the case of silica .",
    "thus , we demonstrate that the structure - matching method provides a systematic scheme to obtain effective potentials from _ ab initio _ trajectories .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ais]a we present the methodology as well as the simulations parameters we use for the _ ab initio _ simulations .",
    "the results of these simulations are used as input to the force matching procedure described in sec .",

    "is described in sec .",

    "[ cao ] we give a summary .",
    "in this section , we will first give the details on the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations that have been used to generate the data that is afterwards used to make the fits .",
    "subsequently , we will present two fitting procedures that allow to obtain an effective potential .",
    "the system considered in the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations contains @xmath6 particles , _",
    "i.e. _  38 sio@xmath4 units , confined in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the size of the box is @xmath7 which corresponds to a mass density of @xmath8g / cm@xmath0 , the experimental value of the density of silica at room temperature  @xcite . to obtain an initial configuration ,",
    "we have first carried out a classical simulation at 3600k using the bks potential  @xcite . from this simulation",
    "we have extracted an equilibrium configuration and used it as starting point for the car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) runs @xcite .",
    "although the bks potential is not perfectly reliable regarding the structural properties of sio@xmath4 , it does give a reasonable description of the structure and hence the _ ab initio _",
    "simulation do not have to be very long in order to reach an equilibrium state .    within the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations , we have described the electronic structure of the system by means of the kohn - sham formulation of the density functional theory using the local density approximation @xcite . the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in a plane - wave basis at the @xmath10 point of the supercell .",
    "core electrons were not treated explicitly but were replaced by atomic pseudopotentials of the bachelet - hamann - schlter type for silicon @xcite and the troullier - martins type for oxygen @xcite .",
    "this choice of pseudopotentials and exchange and correlation functionals are motivated by previous _ ab initio _ simulations of amorphous sio@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the simulations have been carried out with version 3.9.2 of the cpmd code  @xcite , using a time step of @xmath11fs and a fictitious electronic mass of @xmath12atomic units .",
    "the cutoff radius used in the cpmd simulation for defining the spatial extent of the plane waves in the reciprocal space was @xmath13ry .",
    "the simulations were done in the @xmath14 ensemble at 3600k and the temperature was controlled by means of a nos - hoover chain @xcite coupled to each nuclear degree of freedom of the system  @xcite . as documented in refs .",
    "@xcite , this procedure shortens considerably the time for equilibration . as already described in previous studies  @xcite , one finds that in silica the electronic gap can close . to counterbalance the energy flow from the ions to the electrons @xcite , we have therefore connected also the electronic degrees of freedom to a nos - hoover chain .",
    "the sample was equilibrated within the cpmd for 3.5ps , a time span that for this temperature is sufficiently long to allow all the species to reach a diffusive behavior .",
    "the equilibration was followed by a production run of 16ps and this trajectory was used to calculate the observables of interest for the system discussed in more detail below ( radial distribution functions , forces , _ etc .",
    "in practice , we have extracted from this trajectory one hundred configurations , _",
    "i.e. _  one configuration every @xmath15fs , and the wave - function of each of these configurations has been quenched to the born - oppenheimer surface .",
    "although a @xmath13ry energy cutoff is sufficient to obtain converged values for the forces , we have used a cutoff of @xmath16ry to ensure the proper convergence of the diagonal elements of the stress tensor .",
    "more details on this can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      the so - called `` force matching ( fm ) procedure '' proposed by ercolessi and adams , ref .",
    "@xcite , starts from the physical idea that the forces on particle @xmath17 as obtained from the effective potential , @xmath18 , should be able to reproduce as closely as possible the real force on the particle , _ i.e. _  in the present case the force obtained from the _ ab initio _ simulations , @xmath19 .    to achieve this goal we introduce the cost function @xmath20 which is defined as @xmath21 here @xmath22 stands for the canonical average , which in our case is approximated by the average over the 100 selected configurations mentioned above .",
    "in contrast to the original method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the force difference for particle @xmath17 is here divided by @xmath23 , the average standard deviation of the force acting on particle @xmath17 .",
    "this modification is motivated by the fact that different type of atoms will experience different _ average _ forces and fluctuations , and hence the cost function , should take this into account . in practice ,",
    "we have considered that all atoms of a given specie have the same @xmath23 , and have used the following definition for @xmath24 , for @xmath25  si , o : @xmath26 where the second equality holds because @xmath27 .",
    "the numerical values determined for @xmath28 and @xmath29 are 3.55ev /  and 2.69ev /  , respectively .",
    "the functional form of the effective potential considered for the fit is basically the same as the one proposed by van beest , kramer , and van santen  @xcite and is given by : @xmath30 the short range ( sr ) part of the potential ( i.e.  the second and third term ) is of the buckingham type and has been truncated and shifted at a distance @xmath31 . in order to have a smooth function",

    "note that none of the subsequent results will depend in a relevant manner on the choice of these parameters . finally , we mention that the coulombic term in eq .",
    "( [ bpotential ] ) has been calculated using the ewald summation method @xcite . for convenience",
    "we will use in the following the notation @xmath41 to designate the 10 parameters of the effective potential that have to be minimized ( _ i.e. _  @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) .",

    "i.e. _  a minimization approach that combines the gauss - newton algorithm and the steepest descent method .",
    "the weighting between these two algorithms is regulated by a parameter which is iteratively being updated  @xcite .",
    "far from any local minima the levenberg - marquardt behaves similar to the steepest descent method , close to a local minimum , where the gradient becomes very small , the minimization is done by means of the more computational demanding gauss - newton algorithm . note that this method requires the calculation of the first derivatives of the cost function @xmath46 with respect to the parameters @xmath47 . due to the very simple form of the buckingham - coulomb ansatz it is possible to calculate analytically these expressions so as to gain precision and computing efficiency .",
    "these analytical forms have been thereafter numerically evaluated for the purpose of the fit .    in the following",

    "this re - equilibration has been achieved by replacing every 50 time steps the velocities of all the particles by ones that have been drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xcite .",

    "for the case of a metal , where the forces are not covalent and much less directional , this effect can be expected to play a smaller role , thus rationalizing why for such systems the force matching method works significantly better than it is the case here  @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we can conclude from the present work that using the local structure as target for the optimization of the parameters of the potential is a very promising approach . as it is set up",
    ", the method gives a lot of freedom on the functional form that one wants to use , and thus one can of course also use , _",
    "e.g. _ , three body potentials .",
    "it is also possible to include in the cost function additional quantities , such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , elastic constants etc .",
    "the future will tell how useful the method will be for multi - component systems , but one can expect that as long as the number of parameters does not become too large , the approach will indeed allow to obtain reliable effective potentials .",
