    "an important part of information about the structure of the atomic nucleus is obtained by nuclear @xmath2 decay . studies close to the valley of nuclear stability",
    "enable to precisely test our understanding of this structure , whereas experiments and theoretical work with nuclei far away from the stability line enables investigations of the evolution of nuclear structure as a function of isospin .",
    "however , further away from stability and in particular on the proton - rich side of the valley of stability , nuclei no longer decay by simple @xmath2 decay , but by @xmath2-delayed particle emission  @xcite .",
    "therefore , spectroscopic studies become more difficult , as @xmath1-ray spectroscopy has to be combined with particle detection , i.e. proton and @xmath3-particle detection .",
    "gamma detection is commonly achieved with high - efficiency germanium detectors which allow to resolve different @xmath1 lines with good precision .",
    "charged particles are detected with silicon detectors which can reach modest energy resolutions of about 10 - 20 kev .",
    "a combination of charged - particle detection and @xmath1-ray measurements may permit to establish even complicated @xmath2-decay schemes and compare them to theoretical predictions from microscopic models as the nuclear shell model .",
    "a long - standing problem is the observation of `` quenching '' of the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength , when experimental results , either from nuclear @xmath2 decay or from charge - exchange reactions , are compared with theoretical results . having a slight mass dependence this quenching reaches a value of about 0.6 for the transition strength .",
    "the quenching is seen from a comparison of the experimental and the theoretically calculated transition strength b(gt )  @xcite .",
    "although this quenching is known since many years and has been observed for basically all nuclei where these kinds of studies has been performed , two possible explanations are still discussed in the literature ( see  @xcite ) : i ) problems in the shell - model calculations which do not take into account enough orbitals to describe the transition strength correctly . in particular ,",
    "intruder orbitals giving rise to higher - energy excitations are usually not included to keep the model calculations feasible .",
    "ii ) sub - nuclear excitations , especially of the @xmath4 resonance , may shift transition strength to excitation energies as high as 100  mev and are therefore rather difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "a paper of arima  @xcite retracing to some extent the history of this quenching shows that the gt strength quenching is to a large extent due to two - particle two - hole excitations not included in most calculations .",
    "another question of debate is the isospin mixing or isospin purity of nuclear states . in the @xmath2 decay of proton - rich nuclei ,",
    "the fermi transition populates the isobaric analogue state ( ias ) of the decaying ground state . for @xmath2-emitting nuclei with isospin projection @xmath5 0 , this ias is within the q@xmath6 window and decays either by @xmath1 emission or , for sufficiently proton - rich nuclei , by proton emission .",
    "however , as this ias has an isospin quantum number equal to the one of the parent nucleus , proton emission from this state to states in the @xmath2-delayed proton ( @xmath2p ) emission daughter nucleus is forbidden by isospin conservation and thus only permitted by a small isospin impurity of either the ias or of the final state after proton emission .",
    "as the ias usually lies in a region with a much higher density of nuclear states than the daughter state , often a nuclear ground state , the ias has generally a higher degree of isospin impurity than its daughter state .",
    "if this is the case , the isospin mixing has its origin mainly in a mixing of the ias with nearby lying states having a one - unit lower isospin quantum number , but the same spin quantum number . according to perturbation theory , the mixing gets larger with decreasing energy difference between the two states .",
    "of course , mixing is possible not only with one state , but with any state , however , with rapidly decreasing amplitude as the energy difference increases .",
    "the decay of @xmath0ar , the subject of the present work , was studied several times in the past ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "our experimental data are compared to the most recent work from these authors and experimental averages are confronted to theoretical shell - model calculations using different effective interactions optimized for the 2s1d nuclear shell - model space . in particular , we will determine the gamow - teller strength distribution and investigate the possibility to identify the state(s ) responsible for isospin mixing in @xmath0cl .",
    "the isospin mixing of the ias was suggested to be as much as 20% for @xmath0cl  @xcite , a huge value compared to `` today '' standards .",
    "hardy et al .",
    "@xcite and borge et al .",
    "@xcite studied the decay of @xmath0ar in detail in order to extract the gt strength distribution .",
    "schardt et al .",
    "@xcite and garcia et al .",
    "@xcite also determined limits of possible scalar contributions to @xmath2 decay and the fermi - to - gamow - teller ratio of the decay of @xmath0ar .",
    "we will in particular use this ratio in our analysis and comparison to theory .    in the present work , the use of high - resolution silicon surface - barrier detectors and of a high - efficiency @xmath1-detection array permitted to determine the proton branches to the ground as well as to the first and second excited states in the proton daughter . in particular ,",
    "the gt distribution in the full q@xmath6 window was established and a detailed comparison to shell - model calculations was performed .",
    "the isotopes of interest were produced by projectile fragmentation of a @xmath7ar@xmath8 primary beam at 95  mev / nucleon with intensities between 4  @xmath9a and 8  @xmath9a provided by the coupled cyclotrons of ganil .",
    "this beam was fragmented in the spiral carbon target .",
    "the spiral ecr source then produced a low - energy beam of @xmath0ar@xmath10 , which was directed to the spiral identification station , where the experimental setup was mounted .",
    "the beam line to this detection station was regularly optimized by means of a stable @xmath11ar@xmath10 beam produced with the ecr source .",
    "secondary beam intensities of 1200 pps on average were obtained for @xmath0ar@xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath0ar beam was contaminated by small amounts of @xmath12ar possibly transmitted as a gas to the detection setup .",
    "beam profilers and faraday cups close to the detection setup allowed to optimize the beam position in the experimental setup and to monitor the beam intensity ( mainly stable isotopes or molecules ) .",
    "the secondary beam was finally intercepted in the center of the experimental setup by means of a 0.9  @xmath9 m thick aluminized mylar foil ( 1  cm @xmath13 2  cm ) mounted on a thin metallic frame .",
    "the standard detection setup of the spiral identification station was replaced by the silicon cube detector  @xcite and three high - efficiency germanium detectors from the exogam array  @xcite .",
    "the silicon cube consists of six double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dsssds ) with 16@xmath1316 strips and a pitch of 3  mm forming a cube surrounding the mylar catcher foil .",
    "these dsssds were backed by six large - area ( 50x50  mm@xmath14 ) passivated implanted planar silicon ( pips ) detectors used to detect @xmath2 particles .",
    "the thicknesses of the different detectors are given in table  [ tab : thickness ] .",

    "the arrangement of the detectors can be seen in figure  [ fig : setup ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to determine the absolute branching ratio to the ias , we now need the statistical rate function or fermi function calculated from the @xmath2-decay q@xmath6 value ( 11.6193(6 )  mev  @xcite ) from which we subtract the excitation energy of the ias ( 5.5478(9 )  mev )  @xcite and the half - life of @xmath0ar .",
    "for the half - life , we use the average of different literature values  @xcite for which we find 173.9(9 )  ms .",
    "the statistical rate function is calculated to be 3501(4 ) . with these numbers , we determine a branching ratio to the ias of 31.0(14)% .    the branching ratio to the ground state of @xmath0cl could not be determined in our experiment .",
    "we therefore assume that mirror symmetry is a good approximation and calculate its feeding from the @xmath15 value of the mirror decay .",
    "@xmath0p decays with a 100% branch to the ground state of @xmath0s . the half - life ( 25.34(12 )",
    "d ) and the q@xmath16 value ( 248.5(11 )  kev )  @xcite enables us to determine the @xmath15 value to be 107280(2250 )  s ( @xmath17 = 5.03(1 ) ) . using this @xmath15 value for the decay to the ground state of @xmath0cl , we determine a branching ratio of 18.7(4)% .",
    "the difficulty is now to convert the branching ratios for the feeding of bound levels in @xmath0cl to absolute branching ratios .",
    "we will test two ways of determining these branching ratios . in the first procedure , we use the total proton branching ratio and the branching ratio to the ground state to deduce the feeding of bound excited levels as the three contributions should add up to 100% , as long as @xmath1 decay of proton - unbound levels is negligible . in the second",
    ", we use the decay of @xmath0cl and the relative intensities of the @xmath1 transition in @xmath0cl to determine the feeding of bound levels .",
    "for the first procedure , we can obtain the total proton branching ratio in two ways : i ) by summing all proton branching ratios in table  [ tab : protons ] , ii ) by integrating the @xmath2-gated proton spectrum assuming that it contains all proton events .",
    "however , in second this case , one has to cut the @xmath2 particles by means of a threshold which we chose , somewhat arbitrarily , to be 1000  kev .",
    "we note that the final result changes by 0.8% , if we integrate the proton spectra starting at 900 kev . we include this in the final error",
    ". the total proton rate can then be normalized by means of the known absolute branching ratio of the ias of 31.0(14)% .",
    "we determine a ratio between the number of counts for the ias proton line and the total proton intensity of 78(2)% .",
    "in the former procedure , where we sum the branching ratios from table  [ tab : protons ] , we obtain a total proton branching ratio of 36.9(17)% .",
    "the latter procedure gives a value of 39.7(12)% .",
    "we adopt a final value of 38.8(13)% for this first procedure .    with the branching ratio to the ground state of @xmath0cl of 18.7(4)% and the total proton branching ratio of 38.8(13)%",
    ", we derive a branching ratio to bound excited states in @xmath0cl of 42.5(17)% . from this number and the relative @xmath1 branching ratios ( see figure  [ fig : gammas ] and table  [ tab : gammas ] ) , one can determine the absolute branching ratios for the feeding of the 810  kev level of 40.5(16 ) % and for the 2352  kev level of 2.0(3)% .    in the second procedure to determine the total branching ratio for decays to bound states in @xmath0cl , we calculate these branching ratios from the observation of the decay of @xmath0cl .",
    "the @xmath1 ray at 2868  kev from this decay has a branching ratio of 0.44(6)%  @xcite .",
    "if we use the observed relative branching ratio for this @xmath1 ray from table  [ tab : gammas ] and the possible branches populating the ground state of @xmath0cl , we determine a branching ratio of the 810  kev @xmath1 ray of @xmath0cl of 51.4(120)% and of 2.6(6)% for the branching ratio to the 2352  kev level .",
    "these values agree with those determined with the first procedure , but they are significantly less precise .",
    "we therefore adopt the values obtained with the first procedure .",
    "the procedures just laid out assume that there is no @xmath1 decay of proton decaying levels .",
    "in addition , forbidden transitions could falsify the gt strength distribution calculated in the following .",
    "the possible presence of forbidden transitions is shortly discussed below .    with these absolute branching ratios for the feeding of the ground state of @xmath0cl as well as of the bound and unbound excited states of @xmath0cl",
    ", one can determine the feeding of all states in the decay of @xmath0ar , the gamow - teller strength b(gt ) and its sum .",
    "these data are given in table  [ tab : bgt ] .",
    "for the 762  kev and 2941  kev proton lines , we adopted the level energy calculated only from the 2941  kev protons , as the low - energy protons are much stronger affected by the energy loss in the silicon dead layer and in the mylar foil of the catcher than the high - energy protons .",
    "for all other decays , we use average values from decays to the ground and first ( second ) excited states .",
    "in addition , we determine the log(ft ) values for all observed transitions which are given in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "in the work of borge et al .",
    "@xcite , the energy calibration of the silicon detector at higher energies suffers from the fact that the calibration was performed with @xmath3 particles and that the pulse height defect  @xcite was not corrected for .",
    "therefore , with increasing energy above the ias , the proton energies determined become smaller and smaller . in order to find the proton lines in borge et al .",
    "corresponding to proton lines of the present work , we corrected for this effect of the borge et al .",
    "data .    compared to previous work  @xcite , we observe all the proton lines identified in the work of borge et al .",
    "however , eight of them are now attributed to proton emission to the first excited state rather than to the ground state ( see table  [ tab : protons ] ) .",
    "generally , the branching ratios of borge et al . are higher than our values . as for schardt et al .",
    "@xcite , the proton group at 1750  kev corresponds most likely to our proton energy of 1764(5 )  kev observed in coincidence with the 2230  kev @xmath1 ray .",
    "the lines at 2121  kev and 2096  kev observed by schardt et al . are not resolved in the present work .",
    "they correspond to our line at 2100(3 )  kev .",
    "the 1665  kev line is assigned to the decay to the second excited state , as observed in the present work .",
    "honkanen et al .",
    "@xcite identified two weak lines at 3485  kev and 5658  kev .",
    "the first one corresponds probably to our line at 3469(6 )  kev which we observe in coincidence with the @xmath1 ray at 2230  kev ( see below ) . for the higher - energy line",
    ", we can not exclude that it corresponds to our proton line at 5623(3 )  kev .",
    "table  [ tab : protons ] gives the proton group energies , their absolute intensities from the different experiments and the average intensities .",
    "the branching ratios of the previous work were updated with respect to the branching ratio to the ias as determined above . for the experimental proton energies , we give only our energies .    in table",
    "[ tab : bgt ] , we compare the levels observed in the present work with those found in the latest review of properties of the mass a=33 chain by endt  @xcite . the levels given in this compilation come both from @xmath2-decay studies  @xcite and from reaction work  @xcite . for levels determined by different experimental approaches ,",
    "we find reasonable agreement . for higher - energy levels",
    ", we just compare with those deduced from reaction work as the comparison with @xmath2-decay work has already been done in table  [ tab : protons ] .",
    "therefore , in table  [ tab : bgt ] , we only compare with previously established states deduced from work other than @xmath2 decay .",
    "similarly , the spin values shown come only from reaction studies .",
    "if we compare our results to shell - model calculations  @xcite ( see table  [ tab : bgt ] ) , we find that below the ias only one predicted state at 3.863  mev with a branching ratio of 0.0747% is not observed experimentally .",
    "all other predicted states are observed experimentally with branching ratios in most cases close to the predicted ones .    for a comparison of the experimental gt strength distribution with theoretical predictions ,",
    "the theoretical strength has to be quenched .",
    "the origin of this quenching is not completely clear , but excitations of sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom , notably of the @xmath4 resonance , and , probably to a much larger degree , contributions from outside the considered model space are most often suspected ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a typical quenching factor for the @xmath18 shell is q@xmath14 = 0.5 . with our data",
    ", we can check this quenching factor .",
    "we will use experimental b(gt ) values deduced for individual transitions below the ias and compare them to the b(gt ) strength for the equivalent transitions ( see table  [ tab : bgt ] ) as predicted by theory .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : quenching ] .",
    "a fit of these theoretical data as a function of the experimental data yields a quenching factor of 0.49(4 ) .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the generally accepted quenching in the @xmath18 shell .    using this quenching factor",
    ", we can compare the summed experimental b(gt ) strength with the prediction from the shell model .",
    "for this comparison , we use calculations with three different effective shell - model interactions for the @xmath18 model space : the usd interaction  @xcite and two newly determined interactions usda and usdb  @xcite . for this purpose , we convert the experimental branching ratio into a b(gt ) strength for each individual level observed . as a function of the excitation energy , this strength is then summed .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : bgt ] . at low excitation energies , almost perfect agreement of the experimental data with all three interactions",
    "is obtained . at higher excitation energy ,",
    "the new interactions usda and usdb seem to slightly better fit the data .",
    "nonetheless , for all three interactions , the agreement is remarkable .",
    "the procedure just described has one drawback : only decay strength identified as a peak usually is taken into account .",
    "very weak decay branches are omitted .",
    "therefore , we developed a procedure which uses all strength present in the proton spectra .",
    "for this purpose , we take the total charged - particle spectrum as obtained by means of the silicon detectors and subtract first the @xmath2 background by a fit of the low - energy part of this spectrum . in a second step ,",
    "we subtract the decay strength to the first and second excited state .",
    "these contributions are obtained from the proton spectrum conditionned by the detection of these @xmath1 rays renormalized by the gamma efficiency .",
    "this yields the proton decay strength to the ground state .",
    "now we have to convert this spectrum bin by bin to a center - of - mass ( cm ) spectrum .",
    "to this we add the decay spectrum ( again converted to the center - of - mass ) to the first excited state shifted by the excitation energy of this state .",
    "similarly , we treat the spectrum for decays to the second excited state . after a correction for the proton separation energy ,",
    "this yields the excitation energy spectrum to which we have added the decay to bound states ( see figure  [ fig : bgt_spec]a ) . after calculating the statistical rate function @xmath19 for each energy bin",
    ", we can determine the b(gt ) value for each energy bin ( figure  [ fig : bgt_spec]b ) .",
    "this spectrum can be compared to the theoretical b(gt ) values for individual transitions ( figure  [ fig : bgt_spec]c ) and the summed b(gt ) distribution ( figure  [ fig : bgt_spec]d ) . at high excitation energies , the summed experimental b(gt )",
    "distribution exceeds the theoretical one with a quenching of 0.5 .",
    "if we integrate the b(gt ) up to 11  mev we get 5.3 which correspond to a quenching of 0.59 .",
    "to discuss the contribution at very high excitation energy is always delicate , enough to say that if we integrate in the full q@xmath16 window of 11.6193  mev the cumulated b(gt ) grows to 41.2 .",
    "a possible explanation for this large b(gt ) sum is that we shift too much strength to high excitation energies by attributing too much decay strength to decays to excited states , in particular to the second excited state . to test this assumption , we calculated the gt strength distribution also by omitting the second excited state and both excited states . however , even when omitting both excited states , we still exceed the quenched theoretical b(gt ) values .",
    "another possible explanation could be that we deal to some extent with forbidden transitions . in the latest analysis of singh et al .",
    "@xcite , the log(ft ) values of allowed transitions are distributed over a large range from 3 to 7 , whereas forbidden transitions start with values of about 5 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : scheme ]",
    ", we determined indeed high log(ft ) values which could be due to forbidden transitions . however , as we have no means to distinguish between allowed and forbidden transitions , we assume that all transitions are allowed , but we give their spins in parenthesis to indicate this uncertainty .    finally , background is of course also a concern .",
    "proton - proton pile up might create high - energy events which get an important weight due to the larger space phase factor .",
    "however , we do not have any means to distinguish such possible background counts from real counts .",
    "the good agreement between experimental and theoretical b(gt ) strength up to rather high excitation energies shows that the quenching is the same at low and at high excitation energies .",
    "a comparison of figures  [ fig : bgt ] and  [ fig : bgt_spec ] shows that no major proton groups are missing in table  [ tab : protons ] and basically all strength is identified in the peaks . if this were not the case , the second procedure arriving at figure  [ fig : bgt_spec ] should yield more b(gt ) strength than the procedure which produces the spectrum of figure  [ fig : bgt ] .      under the assumption of allowed transitions ,",
    "all levels populated in the @xmath2 decay of @xmath0ar ( i@xmath20  = 1/2@xmath21 ) have spin / parity 1/2@xmath21 or 3/2@xmath21 . however , certain characteristics observed in the present study may allow to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "we will use the observed proton lines to propose spins for some levels .",
    "this will be discussed in the following .",
    "proton emission from a nuclear state is governed by two effects : the barrier penetration and the spatial overlap of the initial and the final states . for a given nucleus , the barrier penetration depends on the energy available for the proton and the barrier height .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb barrier is the same for all states and all emissions .",
    "however , for a transition with a non - zero angular momentum , the angular momentum barrier is added .",
    "therefore , proton transitions to the ground state are favored by the available energy , except if angular momentum has to be `` carried away '' by the proton .",
    "if states emit protons only to an excited state in the proton daughter nucleus , this can be an indication that this transition has a lower angular momentum than the ground state transition , a fact which would enable us to distinguish between two possible spin assignments .",
    "such an assignment , however , neglects the possibility that strongly different overlaps of the initial and final wave functions can have a similar effect . in principle",
    ", model calculations would have to be performed for all states involved before such an assignment can be made .",
    "we believe that this is not very meaningful , as the states calculated e.g. in shell - model calculations might differ strongly from the observed states , even if the excitation energy is equivalent .",
    "we assign tentatively a spin of 3/2@xmath21 to all states which decay only to the first excited state in the proton - daughter nucleus @xmath22s .",
    "we give these spin / parities in parenthesis to make clear that this is a tentative assignment .",
    "the states at 7762  kev and at 8491  kev decay to the 0@xmath21 ground state and the 0@xmath21 second excited state .",
    "this indicates that the emitting state has most likely a spin / parity of 1/2@xmath21 which yields an @xmath23  = 0 proton emission .    for other states , barrier penetration calculations ( see table  [ tab : penetration ] )",
    "may elucidate the situation .",
    "the barrier penetration is calculated from coulomb wave functions  @xcite which yields partial half - lives for both spin possibilities for decays to the ground and excited states .",
    "the ratios of the partial half - lives for emission to the ground and excited states for both spins are then compared to the ratio of the experimental branching ratios . if we believe that the situation is relatively clear and one spin assignment gives a much closer agreement than the other spin , we propose a spin .",
    "the procedure used is tested with and works well for the state at 7292  kev , for which we find a spin of 3/2@xmath21 in agreement with the literature  @xcite .    for the state at 9152",
    "kev which decays to the three lowest states of @xmath22s , we determine that for a 3/2@xmath21 emitting state the decay to the first excited state is indeed the fastest transition thus receiving the highest branching ratio . for a spin 1/2@xmath21",
    ", the decay to the ground state is calculated to be a factor of ten faster than the decay to the other two states , opposite to the experimental observation .",
    "we therefore attribute a spin 3/2@xmath21 to this state .    we underline again that the present spin assignments have to be confirmed by other means before they should be accepted .",
    "therefore , they appear in parenthesis in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "proton emission from the t=3/2 ias in @xmath0cl can only take place due to isospin impurity either in the proton emitting state or in the proton daughter state .",
    "therefore , honkanen et al .",
    "@xcite searched for states in the vicinity of the ias with which the ias can mix .",
    "we identified three of the four states discussed by honkanen et al .",
    "there is one state about 230  kev below the ias and two other states 180  kev and 310  kev above the ias .",
    "however , we do not have evidence for a state about 100  kev below the ias which would be the best candidate for mixing between such a state ( t=1/2 , i@xmath20=1/2@xmath21 ) and the ias ( t=3/2 , i@xmath20=1/2@xmath21 ) .",
    "the proton group identified by honkanen et al .",
    "@xcite at 3073  kev corresponds to our peak at 3066  kev .",
    "however , we clearly identify the proton group to decay to the first excited state and not to the ground state as suggested by honkanen et al .",
    "therefore , the emitting state is no longer in the vicinity of the ias .",
    "we do not completely exclude the possibility of such a close - by state , as our resolution is maybe not good enough to resolve several small peaks in the close vicinity of the strong ias .",
    "however , if such a state is absent , the mixing has to take place with states further away from the ias .",
    "a better resolution experiment with higher statistics is certainly needed to answer this question .    a state with ( t=1/2 , i@xmath20=1/2@xmath21 ) about 100  kev below the ias was also observed in proton scattering experiments on @xmath22s  @xcite .",
    "this would of course be a good candidate for isospin mixing with the ias . as mentioned above",
    ", we do not observe such a state .",
    "however , we can not exclude that our proton peak at 3066  kev contains also a small branch to the ground state of @xmath22s .",
    "it is interesting to note that the shell model using the three different usd interactions  @xcite does not predict any ( t=1/2 , i@xmath20=1/2@xmath21 ) state close to the ias .",
    "the states close to the ias have all a spin of i@xmath20=3/2@xmath21 .",
    "the closest i@xmath20=1/2@xmath21 state is at about 400  kev above the ias for the usd interaction , 550  kev above for the usda interaction , and 450  kev above the ias for usdb . below the ias , the first ( t=1/2 , i@xmath20=1/2@xmath21 ) state is typically 800 - 900 kev away from the ias .",
    "the information accumulated in the present paper together with the results from previous work enables us to establish a rather complete decay scheme of @xmath0ar with decays to bound states and proton unbound states which then decay to the three lowest states of @xmath22s by proton emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : scheme ] gives this decay scheme .",
    "we remind the reader that the branching ratios for the three proton - bound states are based on the assumption of mirror symmetry of the ground states of @xmath0ar and @xmath0p .",
    "using a novel experimental setup of high granularity and high efficiency for charged - particle detection combined with a high - efficiency @xmath1 array allowed a complete study of the decay of @xmath0ar to be performed .",
    "the experimental results are to a large extent in agreement with previous experimental studies of this nucleus .",
    "they enabled us to establish a quasi complete decay scheme of @xmath0ar and to compare the experimental results with shell - model calculations using different effective interactions optimized for the @xmath18 shell - model space .",
