    "it is known that magnetic fields play important role in the astrophysical phenomena , such as supernovae , gamma - ray bursts , galaxy jet , and so on .",
    "recently , there is a growing consensus in explaining soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) via the magnetar model @xcite .",
    "magnetars are believed to be neutron stars with strong magnetic field which is responsible for the observed flare activity .",
    "three giant flares , sgr 0526 - 66 , sgr 1900 + 14 , and sgr 1806 - 20 , have been detected so far .",
    "the peak luminosities are in the range of @xmath0 erg / s .",
    "this huge amounts of energy can be explained by the presence of a strong magnetic field whose strength is estimated to be larger than @xmath1 gauss for sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite and of the order of @xmath2 gauss for sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the initial short and hard peak , these three events show a decaying tail lasting hundreds of seconds .",
    "in this late part careful analysis revealed the existence of characteristic quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) ; see @xcite for references .",
    "the oscillation frequencies in these qpos are in the range of a few tenths of hz to khz and thought to be associated with crust torsional modes of magnetars .",
    "these signals might be the first evidence of a direct detection of crust oscillations of neutron stars : a first attempt to explain these frequencies by the crust torsional oscillations has been done by using a model with dipole magnetic fields and realistic eos ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and this attempt was partially successful .",
    "on the other hand @xcite suggested an alternative scenario to explain the observational frequencies via alfvn oscillations while @xcite was the first to realize that the alfvn oscillations of magnetars could be a continuum .",
    "more recently @xcite pointed out that the edges or turning point of the continuum can be long - lived qpos . in a recent paper , @xcite showed that the alfvn oscillations of magnetars could be a continuum which can explain the lower ones of the observed frequencies .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to construct realistic models for neutron star magnetic fields and/or to understand the details of their dynamics .",
    "in fact , the observational data suggest that the surface temperature of neutron stars with a strong magnetic field is not uniform ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". this observational evidence can be explained , for example , by the presence of magnetic fields in the crust region with a strong toroidal components or a more complicated structure than the poloidal one @xcite .",
    "such crustal magnetic fields can be generated if the core is a type i superconductor . in this case , the magnetic fields are expelled from the core due to the meissner effect after about @xmath3 years .",
    "recently , the analysis of the spectrum of timing noise for sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 has supported the idea that the core region can be a type ii superconductor @xcite . for the type ii superconductor ,",
    "even if an initial uniform magnetic field is present in the core , it will be split in thin magnetic fluxes tubes ( _ fluxoids _ ) , which are parallel to the initial magnetic field .",
    "these fluxoids interact with the neutron vortices and are driven by these vortices outside the core , towards the crust on a timescale of @xmath4 years @xcite . in any case , it is too difficult to discriminate between all these models by using only the past observational data .",
    "this is due to uncertainties associated with the chemical composition of the interior and the crust of neutron stars as well as about the interior magnetic field configuration and its influence on the properties of neutron star .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the axisymmetric crust torsional modes of magnetars with both poloidal and toroidal magnetic field , where both the components are confined in the crust .",
    "then our numerical results show that this magnetic configuration can not explain the actual observational data of sgrs . in this paper , we adopt the unit of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath8 .",
    "the deformation from spherical symmetry due to the magnetic pressure would be small , because the magnetic energy is considerably smaller than the gravitational energy .",
    "so in this paper we neglect the effect of deformations induced by the magnetic field as well as the rotational deformations since the known magnetars rotate slowly . for these reasons , the equilibrium model of neutron stars can be described by a spherically symmetric solutions of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations .",
    "the line element is given then by @xmath9 and the 4-velocity is expressed as @xmath10 . in the following ,",
    "we assume an ideal mhd approximation and we consider an axisymmetric magnetic field generated by a 4-current @xmath11 . in order to determine the distribution of magnetic fields we need two basic relations : the maxwell equations and the equation of motions that can be obtained by projecting the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath12 on to the hypersurface normal to @xmath13 ( see equation ( 11 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "these two equations are : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the faraday tensor linked to the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath16 by @xmath17 . with the appropriate gauge condition",
    ", we can set @xmath16 as @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 obtained from the equation ( [ maxwell ] ) , the equation ( [ eular ] ) for @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "thus @xmath23 depends on @xmath25 and we can set @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is a constant , see below for its meaning ) since @xmath28 is of the same order as @xmath25 with respect to the magnetic field strength . if we expand @xmath25 as @xmath29 then , the 4-potential @xmath16 has the form @xmath30 in the following , we will consider only dipole fields i.e. @xmath31 .    in order to obtain an expression for the 4-current @xmath11 , we can get additional equations from the equation ( [ eular ] ) by setting @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a function of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37       \\label{jtilde } , \\\\   \\chi_{,r } & \\equiv & c_s^2(\\ln n ) ' + \\phi ' \\label{chider}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath38 is the sound speed , while in order to derive the above equations we have used the first law of thermodynamics , i.e , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number density of particles . using the integrability condition @xmath41 together with equation ( [ chi ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath42 .",
    "thus we can see that @xmath43 is also function of @xmath25 and it is possible to rewrite @xmath43 as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are some constants . comparing this last expression with equation ( [ jtilde ] ) , we get the following expression for @xmath47 : @xmath48 for simplicity we neglect the contribution of @xmath46",
    ". can contribute in the equation ( [ gs ] ) as the term of order @xmath49 .",
    "however we use @xmath50 since the contributions from terms with @xmath51 are negligible .",
    "additionally , the omission of the @xmath46 term leads to the condition adopted in @xcite in the limit of @xmath52 . ]    setting @xmath21 in maxwell equations ( [ maxwell ] ) and by making use of equation ( [ jphi ] ) we derive the following equation for @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "for the exterior region , if we assume only dipole magnetic fields , i.e. , @xmath56 , there is an analytic solution for @xmath57 that is : @xmath58 ,       \\label{out_a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the magnetic dipole moment observed at infinity .",
    "the interior solution for @xmath53 should be determined by solving numerically equation ( [ gs ] ) and requiring that @xmath53 and @xmath60 are continuous across the stellar surface .",
    "hence , the components of the vector @xmath61 , are given by @xmath62 > from these expressions , we can see that the parameter @xmath27 is a constant associated only with the toroidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "additionally the value of @xmath27 is chosen in the range where the function of @xmath53 has no node inside the star .",
    "therefore there exists a maximum value of @xmath27 named as @xmath63 .",
    "note that we can produce magnetar models with larger value of @xmath27 than @xmath63 .",
    "but for these models , the structure of the magnetic field becomes more complex since the sign of current is not constant in the star , and this could lead to possible instability of the magnetic fields .",
    "in other words , when the sign of current changes , even if the star remains stable the magnetic field structure might undergo a catastrophic instability which will restructure the field .",
    "so we examine only the magnetar models with @xmath64 .",
    "in this paper we consider a stellar model with a superfluid core ( type i superconductor ) so that the magnetic field is expelled from the core by the meissner effect . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnetic fields are confined only in the crust region . in order to construct the model",
    ", we have to impose the condition that the magnetic fields are vanishing inside the core , i.e. , we require that @xmath53 should be zero at the basis of crust . this condition can be written as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a constant and @xmath67 is the radius at the basis of the crust . note that at @xmath68 both @xmath69 and @xmath70 vanish while @xmath71 is not zero . in figure",
    "[ fig : field-(ii ) ] , we plot the components of magnetic field , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are defined as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the actual details of the used stellar models will be described in the next section .",
    "it is worth noticing , from these figures , that the @xmath36 components of magnetic fields are not smooth at the stellar surface , because we assume an exterior magnetic field with only a poloidal component , which means @xmath56 for @xmath78 i.e. no toroidal component outside the star .",
    "this choice produces a current on the star surface .",
    "the presence of a surface current is found also in many simulations dealing with the evolution and the stability of the magnetic field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "howevere we do not consider the existence of the surface current in this paper , since the surface current dose not affect the behavior of the torsional oscillations within our analysis .",

    "the different lines correspond to different values of the constant @xmath27 with @xmath84 .",
    "note also that @xmath85 is scaled by a factor ten .",
    ", height=132 ]",
    "in this paper , we adopted polytropic equations of state ( eos ) described by the following relations @xmath86 where @xmath87 g and @xmath88 @xmath89 , and we have set @xmath90 and @xmath91 by fitting the tabulated data for eos a @xcite . with this equation of state and with the fixed value of the density at @xmath68 , @xmath92 g/@xmath93 , the maximum mass is @xmath94 . here",
    "we study two representative stellar models ; one with @xmath95 and the other is the one with the maximum allowed mass for this eos i.e. the one with @xmath96 .",
    "for these two stellar models , the radius , the relative crust thickness , and the compactness are @xmath97 km , @xmath98 % , and @xmath99 for the model with @xmath95 while the model with @xmath96 has @xmath100 km , @xmath101 % , and @xmath102 .",
    "finally , for simplicity the shear modulus in the crust , @xmath103 , is assumed to be given by a relation of the formula @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the speed of shear waves with a typical value @xmath106 cm / s @xcite . in general the frequencies of torsional oscillations",
    "depend on the eos in the crust region since the shear modulus also depend on the eos .",
    "however , in @xcite we have used two different realistic eos for the crust and our results show that the freuqencies of fundamental torsional oscillations are almost independent of them . anyway in this paper , as first approximation , we use the above simple formula for shear modulus .",
    "we study axial perturbations in the cowling approximation of the previous stellar models .",
    "we focus only on these type of oscillations of the crust ( torsional ) since they do not induce density perturbations , which means that significantly lower energy is needed for their excitation . on the other hand",
    "the absence of density perturbations leads to minimal metric perturbations which justifies our choice in using the cowling approximation . under these assumptions",
    "the perturbation equations are reduced to equation ( 51 ) in @xcite . by studying this equation",
    "one can observe that , if the background magnetic fields are axisymmetric , the axisymmetric torsional oscillations are independent from the component @xmath70 of the magnetic field",
    ". thus we can calculate the eigen - frequencies by using the perturbation equations ( 69 ) and ( 70 ) in @xcite with exactly the same boundary conditions , such as @xmath107 at the basis of crust ( @xmath68 ) and at the stellar surface ( @xmath108 ) , where @xmath109 describes the angular displacement of the stellar material .",
    "however , we have to replace @xmath110 in equation ( 70 ) in @xcite by @xmath111 , because for the elimination of the term of @xmath112 we have used equation ( [ gs ] ) .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figure [ fig : type(ii ) ] , where the fundamental @xmath113 torsional modes are plotted as function of the normalized magnetic field @xmath114 ( @xmath115 gauss ) .",
    "> from these figures , it is clear that the frequencies depend weakly on the presence of the toroidal magnetic fields , even if the strength of the toroidal field increases i.e. the value of @xmath27 becomes larger .",
    "this weak dependence can be understood if we recall that the magnetic field lines of the toroidal component are parallel to the direction of fluid motion .",
    "but the most important result is that , although it seems that qualitatively the effect of the magnetic field is similar to the results in @xcite , there is a significant quantitative difference : the influence of the magnetic field on the axisymmetric torsional frequencies becomes apparent for considerably lower strengths of the magnetic field , i.e. already for @xmath116 .",
    "notice that the results in @xcite show that the effect of the magnetic field can be seen for @xmath117 .",
    "it is natural that when the magnetic field is confined in the crust , magnetic field becomes considerably stronger than the one that permeates the whole star for the same strength of the exterior magnetic field . actually , since the magnetic field",
    "is confined in the crust which has thickness @xmath118 km , the density of magnetic field lines becomes higher .",
    "also if we compare the results for the two stellar models under discussion we observe that thinner is the crust , then earlier the effect of the magnetic field becomes pronounced .",
    "for example , for the model with @xmath96 ( @xmath101 % ) the effect of magnetic field is apparent for @xmath119 . for the other model ( @xmath95 and @xmath98 % ) the effect of the magnetic field becomes pronounced later , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "the above results are derived by using the same procedure as in @xcite , i.e. we decompose the system into spherical harmonics and truncate the ( @xmath120 ) terms .",
    "this truncation could introduce small errors in the results , thus in order to check the validity of our results we have used an alternative technique based on 2d numerical evolutions of the perturbation equation describing the dynamics of the oscillating crust .",
    "the 2d method used here is similar to the one described in @xcite and the evolution equations were structurally similar although the various background terms have been modified to include terms related to the shear modulus , @xmath103 .",
    "the 2d evolution was constrained only in the crust and in the first quadrant i.e. @xmath121 and the following boundary conditions have been imposed : ( a ) @xmath107 at @xmath68 and @xmath122 , ( b ) @xmath123 at @xmath79 , and ( c ) @xmath124 at @xmath125 .",
    "the results of the two approaches for @xmath56 are plotted in in figure [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "the continuous line corresponds to results derived by using the truncated equations and treating the problem as a boundary value one while the thick dots correspond to results produced by the 2d numerical evolution .",
    "the agreement between the two approaches is apparent , which suggests that for this type of problems the truncation of the ( @xmath120 ) equations does not affect at all the results .",
    "furthermore , we performed similar calculations for stellar models with different realistic eos , but the behavior of frequencies , as function of a magnetic field , is similar to that for the eos a that we use here .     and @xmath126 , the frequencies of the fundamental torsional modes of @xmath113 as functions of @xmath127 , where @xmath128 gauss .",
    "the different lines correspond to different values of @xmath27 , where @xmath129 for @xmath95 and @xmath130 for @xmath96 .",
    ", height=151 ]    .",
    "the continuous line shows the results from the 1-d truncated mode calculation on which we omitted the coupling to @xmath131 equations while the thick dots correspond to results from 2d numerical evolutions of the perturbation equations . in this figure",
    "two vertical lines has been drawn corresponding to the estimated magnetic field strengths for the two sgrs that is @xmath132 gauss for sgr 1900 + 14 and @xmath133 gauss for sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    ", height=207 ]",
    "we have studied the torsional oscillations for the magnetic field distribution where the magnetic fields has been  expelled \" from the superfluid core and confined in the crust .",
    "we have also assumed that the magnetic field has both poloidal and toroidal components .",
    "the study shows that the presence of the toroidal field affects marginally the oscillation frequencies of the torsional modes , which can be explained because the perturbations propagate along the toroidal field lines .",
    "the toroidal field might play a more significant role in the case of non - axisymmetric perturbations or if we include the coupling to polar perturbations .",
    "the main results of this work is summarized in figure [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "our calculations show that the effect of magnetic field on the torsional modes , when it is confined only in the crust , can be observed for magnetic field strengths below @xmath134 gauss .",
    "moreover , this observation has a significant effect on understanding the geometry of the magnetic field of magnetars .",
    "the reason is the following . with this magnetic field configuration",
    "there are no additional oscillational frequencies such as alfvn oscillations ( see @xcite ) , because the magnetic field does not exist in the core .",
    "thus the @xmath113 torsional oscillation is lowest oscillational frequency . on the other hand",
    "the estimated magnetic field strengths are of the order of a few times @xmath134 gauss @xcite or even higher @xcite .",
    "this suggest that if the magnetic field was constrained to the crust the lowest possible frequency for the signals from sgr 1806 - 20 is about 40 hz .",
    "then , this magnetic field distribution can not explain the observed frequencies 18 , 26 and 29 hz .",
    "so this type of magnetic field geometry can not be present in the observed magnetars and most probably it has to be excluded in general for the case of strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "alternative scenarios which might include coupling with the polar modes should be excluded since crustal perturbations of polar type are typically of considerably higher frequencies @xcite and can not explain all three frequencies .",
