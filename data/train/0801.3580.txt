    "in an ideal scattering experiment with an external beam , the particles pass through a wide homogeneous target of known thickness .",
    "if the fluxes of the incident and scattered particles are measured , the absolute cross section of a reaction can be determined .",
    "the situation is far more complicated for experiments with an internal target at a storage ring where the target thickness can not be simply established through macroscopic measurements .",
    "in such a case the overall normalization of the cross section is not fixed though one can , for example , study an angular dependence or measure the ratio of two cross sections .",
    "if the value of one of these cross sections is known by independent means , the ratio would allow the other to be determined .",
    "however , there are often difficulties in finding a suitable calibration reaction and so it is highly desirable to find an alternative way to measure the effective target thickness inside a storage ring .    when a charged particle passes through matter it loses energy through electromagnetic processes and this is also true inside a storage ring where a coasting beam goes through a thin target a very large number of times .",
    "the energy loss , which is proportional to the target thickness , builds up steadily in time and causes a shift in the frequency of revolution in the machine which can be measured through the study of the schottky spectra  @xcite . knowing the characteristics of the machine and , assuming that other contributions to the energy loss outside the target are negligible or can be corrected for",
    ", this allows the effective target thickness to be deduced .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to show how this procedure could be implemented at the cosy storage ring of the forschungszentrum jlich .",
    "the count rate @xmath0 of a detector system which selects a specific reaction is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the cross section , @xmath3 the solid angle of the detector and @xmath4 the beam - target luminosity .",
    "this is related to the effective target thickness @xmath5 , expressed as an areal density , through @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the particle current of the incident beam .",
    "the luminosity , rather than the target thickness , is the primary quantity that has to be known in order to evaluate a cross section through eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the measurement of a calibration reaction , such as proton - proton elastic scattering , leads directly to a determination of the luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the energy - loss technique described here yields directly an estimate of the effective target thickness , but this can be converted into one of luminosity through the measurement of the beam current , which can be done to high accuracy using a beam current transformer .    originally , the frequency - shift measurements were carried out and analyzed at anke using only a few accelerator cycles over the extended run of a specific experiment in order to get a rough estimate of the available luminosity . however , a careful audit of the various error sources has now been conducted to find out the accuracy that can be achieved .",
    "energy - loss measurements are therefore now routinely carried out in conjunction with the experimental data - taking .",

    "a careful consideration is given here to the different possible sources of error .",
    "these errors are also the dominant ones for the luminosity discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : luminosity ] .",
    "it is shown there that the relative luminosity is already well determined through the use of monitor counters so that the absolute luminosity given by the energy - loss measurement needs only to be investigated for a sub - sample of typical cycles .",
    "a comparison is made with the luminosity measured through elastic proton - proton scattering at 2.65gev , though this is hampered by the limited data base existing at small angles .",
    "our summary and outlook for the future of the energy - loss technique are offered in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] .",
    "cosy is a cooler synchrotron that is capable of accelerating and storing protons or deuterons , polarized and unpolarized , for momenta up to 3.7gev/@xmath8 , corresponding to an energy of 2.9gev for protons and 2.3gev for deuterons  @xcite .",
    "the anke magnetic spectrometer  @xcite , which is located inside one of the straight sections of the racetrack - shaped 183 m long cosy ring , is a facility designed for the study of a wide variety of hadronic reactions .",
    "the accelerator beam hits the target placed in front of the main spectrometer magnet d2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : anke ] .",
    "an assembly of various detectors indicated in the figure allows , in combination with the data - processing electronics , for the identification and measurement of many diverse reactions .",
    "the method of determining the luminosity from the beam energy loss in the target should be applicable to the cases of the hydrogen and deuterium gas in cluster - jet targets or storage cells that are routinely used at anke .",
    "however , due to the short lifetime of the beam , the technique is unlikely to be viable for the foil targets that are sometimes used for nuclear studies .",
    "we discuss in detail the operational conditions of the 2004 beam time where @xmath9-meson production in the @xmath10 reaction was studied  @xcite .",
    "the proton beam with an energy of 2.650gev was incident on a hydrogen cluster - jet target with a diameter of 7 mm  @xcite . in order to accelerate the proton beam from the injection energy of @xmath11mev ,",
    "a special procedure is used at cosy which avoids the crossing of the critical transition energy  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "a lattice setting that has a transition energy of about 1gev is used at injection . during the acceleration the ion optics in the arcs",
    "is manipulated such that the transition energy is dynamically shifted upward .",
    "after the requested energy is reached , the acceleration ( _ rf _ ) cavity is switched off and the ion optics manipulated again such that the dispersion @xmath12 in both straight sections vanishes .",
    "the transition energy is then about 2.3gev , _",
    "i.e. _  the experiment used a coasting beam above the transition . furthermore",
    ", the optics is slightly adjusted to place the working point @xmath13 in the resonance - free region of the machine between 3.60 and 3.66 .",
    "this guarantees that beam losses due machine resonances are avoided .",

    "orbit measurements have validated that the dispersion is here within the range m. since @xmath18 in this region , the ion beam does not move away from the target when its energy decreases .",
    "the ion beam losses occur dominantly in the arcs , where the machine acceptance is lower due to the large dispersion of up to 15 m .",
    "experience has shown that , depending upon the actual target thickness , experiments with the cluster - jet target can be run with cycle times of 5 - 10 minutes with little ion beam losses .    ]",
    "the maximum of the beam - target interaction was found by steering horizontally the proton beam continuously through the target and identifying the highest count rate in the forward detector system which was used as a monitor . the measured overlap profile shown in fig .",
    "[ overlap ] also contains information about the proton beam size .",
    "the predicted profile was obtained by convoluting a cylindrical cluster - jet beam of uniform density and 7 mm diameter  @xcite with a gaussian proton beam profile of width @xmath19 mm . despite the idealized assumptions ,",
    "the measured profile is reasonably well reproduced .",
    "the maximum overlap varies by less than 10% for @xmath20 in the range from 1.0 to 1.5 mm .",
    "the proton beam profile was independently investigated by scraping the beam at the target position with a diaphragm oriented perpendicular to the beam , which was moved through the beam .",
    "this yielded a gaussian beam profile with a total width @xmath21 mm  @xcite .",
    "later dedicated measurements have also confirmed the typical size of the beam  @xcite .    the beam - target interaction , _",
    "i.e. _  the effective target thickness , might decrease during a machine cycle .",
    "this could arise from emittance growth or the dispersion not being exactly zero and would induce a slight nonlinear time dependence of the frequency shift .",
    "emittance growth and effective target thickness are discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : emittancegrowth ] and [ sec : targetthickness ] .",
    "the fact that most anke experiments ran with a coasting beam without cooling offered the possibility for using the energy loss in the target as a direct and independent method for luminosity calibration .",
    "the energy loss @xmath22 per single target traversal , divided by the stopping power @xmath23 and the mass @xmath24 of the target atom , yields the number @xmath25 of target atoms per unit area that interact with the ion beam : @xmath26    over a small time interval @xmath27 , the beam makes @xmath28 traversals , where @xmath29 is the revolution frequency of the machine . if the corresponding energy loss is @xmath30 , eq .",

    "the fractional change in the revolution frequency is proportional to that in the momentum : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the so - called _ frequency - slip parameter_.    putting these expressions together , we obtain @xmath39    in order to be able to deduce absolute values for the target thickness on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , it is necessary to determine @xmath38 with good accuracy .",
    "the revolution frequency depends on the particle speed @xmath40 and orbit length @xmath41 through @xmath42 where , due to dispersion , @xmath41 is also a function of the momentum . defining @xmath43 , we see that @xmath44    here @xmath45 is the so - called _ momentum compaction factor _ , which is a constant for a given lattice setting .",
    "the point of transition , where @xmath46 changes its sign , occurs when @xmath47 .",
    "generally , @xmath45 lies between 0 and 1 , so that @xmath46 is negative below and positive above transition . in terms of @xmath48 ,",
    "the expression for @xmath38 reads : @xmath49    the value of @xmath50 is fixed by the beam momentum , which is known with an accuracy on the order of 10@xmath51 .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is fixed for an individual setting of the accelerator lattice used in the experiment . near the transition point @xmath38",
    "is small and this is the principal restriction on the applicability of the frequency - shift method .",
    "an estimate for @xmath52 may be made using lattice models but , to obtain more reliable values , a measurement of @xmath45 is indispensable .",
    "this is done by changing the magnetic field @xmath53 in the bending magnets by a few parts per thousand and using @xmath54      in addition to energy loss , the beam also experiences emittance growth through the multiple small angle coulomb scattering in the target . at each target",
    "traversal the emittance of the ion beam increases slightly in both directions and , as a consequence , the beam - target overlap may be reduced . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : machineoperation ] , both @xmath12 and @xmath55 are practically zero in the anke region . in this case , the rate of emittance @xmath56 growth is given by  @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents the value of the beta function at the position of the target , and @xmath59 the projected rms scattering angle for a single target traversal .",
    "the @xmath60 factor comes from integrating over the phases of the particle motion in the ion beam .",
    "the value of @xmath59 can be estimated from @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the charge number of the incident particle and @xmath63 the target thickness in units of the radiation length @xmath64  @xcite .",

    "such a discrepancy is larger than the overall systematic uncertainty detailed in table  [ tab : errorpp ] .",

    "this demonstrates clearly the need for more good data in this region .",
    "we have shown that , under the specific experimental conditions described here , the energy loss of a freely circulating ( coasting ) ion beam interacting with a cluster - jet target can be used to determine target thickness and beam - target luminosity .",
    "the method is simple in principle and independent of the properties of particle detectors which are involved in other techniques such as , e.g. , the comparison with elastic scattering .",
    "it relies on the fact that the particles in a circulating beam pass through the target more or less the same number of times so that they build up the same energy shift .",
    "this is broadly true for the experiment reported here , as can be seen from the fact that the schottky spectrum at the end of the cycle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schottky ] has a similar shape to that at the beginning .",
    "relative measurements of the luminosity are straightforward and quick to perform during a run .",
    "the example given here involved the ratio of a monitor rate @xmath70 and proton beam current @xmath71 . such essentially instantaneous measurements have the advantage that defective cycles with , e.g. , a malfunction of the target , the ion beam , or the detection system , can easily be removed from the data analysis .",
    "the calibration of such relative measurements through the energy - loss determination needs only to be done from time to time and not for all runs .    the 5% precision reported here for proton - proton collisions at 2.65gev is mainly defined by the accuracy of the measured frequency shifts .",
    "if the @xmath72 elastic differential cross section were known to say 5% , it is seen from table  [ tab : errorpp ] that the luminosity would only be evaluated using this information at anke to about 12% , which is much inferior to the energy - loss method .",
    "however , the situation can be quite different at other energies or for other targets .     as a function of the energy of proton and deuteron beams .",
    "the experimental points are the results of anke measurements during diverse beam runs .",
    "these are compared with curves corresponding to the predictions of cosy lattice calculations .",

    "( [ eq:9 ] ) becomes very large when @xmath50 is in the region of @xmath52 .",
    "for the lattice setting normally applied in anke experiments , where @xmath74 and the corresponding proton transition energy @xmath75gev , the beam energy range from 1.0 to 1.6gev is not well suited for the energy - loss technique .",
    "the application of the energy - loss technique to deuteron beams and/or deuterium cluster - jet targets goes through identically . for deuteron beams",
    "the method can be used over almost the whole of the cosy energy range .",
    "this is illustrated clearly in fig .",
    "[ xxx ] , which shows various measurements of the @xmath38 parameter for both proton and deuteron beams compared with estimates from cosy lattice calculations .",
    "the shaded area represents the region of small @xmath38 where the method is of limited use .",
    "the energy - loss method could be particularly valuable for deuterons since , in such cases , there is often a lack of reliable @xmath76 elastic or quasi - elastic data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when using small angle elastic @xmath77 cross sections for normalization , it has to be recognized that this varies exceedingly fast with momentum transfer . as a consequence , even a small error in the determination of the angle must be avoided or otherwise the calibration can be seriously undermined  @xcite . since the energy loss is of electromagnetic origin , it could equally well be used with beams of @xmath45-particles or heavier ions .",
    "the density of a cluster - jet target may be the ideal compromise for implementing the energy - loss approach to luminosity studies .",
    "very thin foils are sometimes used as targets at anke  @xcite and the beam then dies too quickly for reliable frequency shifts to be extracted . on the other hand , targets of polarized gas in storage cells",
    "are very important for the future physics program at anke  @xcite .",
    "the overall target thickness is less than that with the cluster jet so that the ring - gas will provide a larger fraction of the energy loss .",
    "the ring - gas effects will also be more important because of greater contamination of the vacuum by the target .",
    "it is therefore clear that a detailed analysis of the specific conditions is required to determine the accuracy to be expected in a particular experiment .",
    "the detailed measurements reported here could only be carried out with the active support of the cosy crew .",
