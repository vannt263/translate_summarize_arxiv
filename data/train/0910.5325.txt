    "among active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , blazars show intense and variable emission above 100  mev @xcite , and the variability time scale can be as short as a few days , or last a few weeks .",
    "they emit across several decades of energy , from the radio to the tev energy band and their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are typically double humped with a first peak occurring in the ir / optical band in the flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and low - energy peaked bl lacs ( lbls ) , and at uv / x - rays in the high - energy peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) .",
    "this peak is commonly interpreted as synchrotron radiation from high - energy electrons in a relativistic jet .",
    "the second sed component is commonly interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of soft seed photons by relativistic electrons , and peaks in the mev  gev and in the tev energy bands in the fsrqs / lbls and in the hbls , respectively .",
    "a recent review of the blazar emission mechanisms and energetics is given in @xcite .",
    "the fsrq ( pks  2251@xmath2158 ; @xmath3 ) is certainly one of the most active extragalatic sources at high energy . in the era , it was detected in 1992 during an intense flaring episode @xcite when its flux @xmath4 was observed to vary within the range @xmath5photons@xmath6s@xmath7 . in 1995 , a 2-week campaign detected a flux @xmath8 of its historical maximum @xcite .",

    "we briefly describe the satellite , and we discuss the various campaigns triggered on .",
    "the agile satellite @xcite is a mission of the italian space agency ( asi ) devoted to high - energy astrophysics , operative since april 2007 .",
    "the scientific instrument combines four active detectors yielding broad - band coverage from hard x - rays to : a silicon tracker  ( st ; * ? ? ?",

    "the hard x - ray monitor on  board agile , super- ( sa ) , reaches a sensitivity of about 15 mcrab at 5-@xmath13 in the energy range 1860  kev in a one - day observation .",
    "at the epoch of the optical flare ( 2007 july 1921 ) the closest pointing position allowed by the solar panel constraints ranged within 35@xmath1540@xmath15 from the source .",
    "because of the remarkably large ( @xmath16sr ) field of view ( fov ) of the grid and the successful detection of the vela pulsar at @xmath17 off - axis obtained during the science verification phase , agile could reliably study despite its large off - axis position .",
    "the observations were performed between 2007 july 24 14:30 ut and 2007 july 30 11:40 ut , for a total pointing duration of @xmath18220  ks .",

    "the average flux above 100 mev for the whole period is @xmath19 .",
    "the average flux above 100 mev for the whole period was the highest ever detected from this source , as shown in figure  [ fig:3c454:lcjul07 ] , panel ( b ) .",
    "the source was not detected ( above 5-@xmath13 ) by the super - agile iterative removal of sources ( iros ) applied to the @xmath20 image , in the 2060  kev energy range .",

    "a multiwavelength campaign started @xcite .",
    "data were collected during two different periods , the first ranging between 2007 - 11 - 10 12:17 ut and 2007 - 11 - 25 10:57 ut and the second between 2007 - 11 - 28 12:05 ut and 2007 - 12 - 01 11:39 ut , for a total of about 592ks .",
    "the three - day gap between them was due to a pre - planned grid calibration activity .",

    "figure  [ fig:3c454:lcnov07 ] shows the multi wavelength light curves during the november 2007 observing campaign .",
    "we investigated the expected @xmath24-optical flux correlation by means of the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) .",
    "the dcf peak occurred at @xmath25 , and its value is @xmath26 .",
    "this indicates a moderate correlation , with no significant time delay between the and optical flux variations .",
    "we fit the seds for two major flaring episodes by means of a one - zone leptonic model , considering the contributions from synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , and from external seed photons originating both from the accretion disk and from the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "we note that during both flaring episodes , the external compton scattering of direct disk radiation ( ecd ) contribution can account for the soft and hard x - ray portion of the spectrum , which show a moderate , if any , time variability .",
    "however , we note that the ecd component alone can not account for the hardness of the spectrum .",
    "we therefore argue that in the energy band a dominant contribution from the external compton scattering of the blr clouds ( ecc ) seems to provide a better fit of the data during the -ray flaring states",
    ".      in december 2007 began a multi wavelength campaign involving _ spitzer _ , _ swift _ , _ suzaku _ , the webt consortium , the rem and mitsume telescopes , offering a broad band coverage that allowed a truly simultaneous sampling of the synchrotron and ic emissions @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:3c454:seddec07 ] shows the sed during 2007 december 13 , characterized by the broadest multi wavelength coverage . during this epoch",
    "the source was in a state characterized by a flux for @xmath9  mev of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "we found that a model accounting for ecd and ecc components does not fully describe the seds in the three epochs .",
    "an additional contribution , possibly from the hot corona with @xmath28 surrounding the jet , is required to account simultaneously for the synchrotron and the inverse compton emissions during those epochs . moreover , a detailed analysis of the correlation between the flux variations in the and optical energy band yields a possible @xmath29 day delay of the emission with respect to the optical one .",
    "starting from may 2008 , conducted several multi wavelength observing campaigns on .",
    "a detailed discussion of these results is presented in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:3c454:18months ] shows the light curves at different energies over the whole period july 2007  january 2009 .",
    "the different panels show , from bottom to top , the /grid light curve at @xmath30-day resolution for e@xmath31100  mev in units of @xmath32 , the /bat light curve in the energy range 15150  kev at @xmath33-week resolution , the /xrt light curve in the energy range 210  kev , the /uvot light curve in the uv @xmath34 filter , the /uvot light curve in the optical @xmath35 filter , the gasp - webt light curve in the optical @xmath1 filter , and the vlbi radio core at 15  ghz ( filled circles ) and the umrao 14.5  ghz ( open squares ) light curves , respectively .",
    "we investigated the correlation between the flux and the optical flux density in the @xmath1 band by means of the dcf method , computing the dcf on four distinct periods : july 2007 ( mid 2007 ) , november  december 2007 ( fall 2007 ) , may  august 2008 ( mid 2008 ) , and october 2007 - january 2009 ( fall 2008 ) .",
    "the period `` fall 2007 '' offers a good opportunity to test the correlation , since the @xmath24-ray flux , and even more the optical flux , exhibited strong variability , and the period of common monitoring lasted for more than a month .",
    "the corresponding dcf shows a maximum @xmath36 for a null time lag .",
    "however , the shape of the peak is asymmetric , and a centroid calculation yields a time lag of @xmath37days .",
    "this result is in agreement with what was found by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "since july 2007 , has been playing the same role for as 3c  279 had for egret , and during the period july 2007 - january 2009 we acquired data not only in the energy band , but across 14 decades in energy .",
    "this allowed us to construct simultaneous seds , sampling high , intermediate , and low emission states , involving both ground and space based observatories .",
    "we found that the role of the external compton on the disk and the broad - line region radiation ( and possibly also on hot corona photons ) is crucial to account for the hard spectrum states .",
    "moreover , thanks to the extremely dense optical coverage provided by the gasp - webt , we were able to study the correlations between the and optical fluxes .",
    "we found a @xmath38 day possible lag of the high energy photons with respect to the optical ones .",
    "the simultaneous presence of two satellites , and fermi , the extremely prompt response of wide - band satellites as , and the long - term monitoring provided from the radio to the optical by the gasp - webt consortium will assure the chance to investigate and study the physical properties of and of several more blazars both at high and low emission states .",
