    "much attention has been drawn to the hierarchy problem associated with higgs boson at the quantum level .",
    "many interesting models including supersymmetric standard model  @xcite and extra dimensional models  @xcite have been proposed on the way to solve it .",
    "the higgs field , the only undiscovered piece of the sm , whose discovery is anticipated to be just round the corner would provide us with an essential guide to probe possible solutions of the hierarcy problem as well as the origin of mass generation . from a new philosophical point of view , the gauge - higgs unification(ghu ) models",
    "@xcite have nowadays drawn renewed attention among extra dimensional models as one interesting alternative solution of the hierarchy problem and the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) . in the ghu scheme ,",
    "the higgs field can be identified as an internal component of a higher dimensional gauge field of a group involving electroweak gauge group , and thus the disastrous quadratic divergences associated with the higgs field are not generated due to the higher dimensional gauge symmetry .",
    "in addition , the ewsb can nicely be accomplished by suitable boundary conditions on orbifold and/or quantum fluctuation using wilson loop on non - simply connected extra dimensional space called hosotani mechanism  @xcite .    in spite of such nice features ,",
    "as shown by aranda and wudka @xcite , any ghu models with bulk ( and simple ) gauge symmetry can not predict correct weak mixing angle @xmath9 , so called the weinberg angle , measured from experiments . except for the weak mixing angle ,",
    "the ghu models are consistent with other low - energy data . to remedy this serious problem in the ghu models , three categories of the solutions have been proposed ; @xmath10 adding the localized brane kinetic terms  @xcite , @xmath11 incorporating ( anomalous ) additional @xmath12 gauge symmetry  @xcite , @xmath13 imposing violation of higher dimensional lorentz symmetry @xmath14  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the first possibility to resolve the problem for the weak mixing angle , and particularly show how the correct value of the weak mixing angle can be obtained without substantial modification of the models by re - scaling @xmath5 and @xmath12 couplings , respectively .",
    "we obtain a little bit modified ratio between higgs scalar and w boson masses , compared with that predicted in the sm , and the higgs mass is shown to be predicted as a function of a model parameter which is responsible for re - scaling of @xmath5 gauge coupling for the values of the weak mixing angle and w boson mass taken to be their experimental values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly introduce a toy @xmath15 model in order to see how the brane kinetic terms in ghu models affect the gauge couplings of @xmath5 and @xmath12 . in section iii",
    ", we present several experimental constraints with which the ghu models should be satisfied and we show which ghu models can be phenomenologically viable and investigate the effects of brane kinetic terms in those models",
    ". we also estimate the higgs mass in several specific extra dimensions for given compactification scales , and derive the ratio between the higgs scalar and @xmath16 boson masses in terms of the mixing angle and two model parameters responsible for re - scaling @xmath5 and @xmath12 gauge couplings . in section iv",
    ", we discuss our numerical results and conclude this paper with some implication .",
    "in this section , we investigate the effects of brane kinetic terms in 5-dimensional(d ) gauge - higgs unification model with su(3 ) gauge symmetry as a toy model  @xcite .",
    "let us begin by considering a lagrangian with a higher dimensional su(3 ) gauge symmetry on a @xmath17 orbifold in 5 dimensions without brane kinetic terms , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the field strength denoted by @xmath20 . here",
    ", latin indices are used to denote 5-dimensional(d ) space - time coordinate , for instance @xmath21 0,1,2,3,5 , whereas greek indices represent usual 4d space - time , @xmath22 0,1,2,3 , and here upper index @xmath23 indicates a group index . the gauge symmetry @xmath24 is broken down to subgroup @xmath25 due to orbifold boundary conditions imposed to the gauge fields at around @xmath26 compactification scale with a projection matrix @xmath27 , @xmath28 where all @xmath29 and @xmath30 fields are lie - algebra valued functions of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are gell - mann matrices .",
    "the components of the @xmath29 corresponding to zero modes with their generators are given by , @xmath33 where the superscript @xmath34 of @xmath29 means zero modes .",
    "similarly , the @xmath30 is given by the following form , @xmath35 note that each component of the @xmath30 has opposite @xmath36 parity to the @xmath29 .",
    "adopting familiar su(2 ) notation of subgroup @xmath37 , all components of the zero modes can be rewritten by @xmath38 let us focus on the 5d lagrangian corresponding to the zero modes , @xmath39 where we have used the fact that the fundamental domain of orbifold is @xmath40 $ ] , and many other terms including @xmath41 can be ignored by taking thin brane approximation and thanks to the properties of fields under orbifold projection  @xcite . after integrating out 5d space ,",
    "the 5d lagrangian becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and the factor contains the length ( or area or volume in more higher dimension ) of the fundamental domain .",
    "re - scaling the zero mode of the 4d gauge field , @xmath44 , and comparing the 4d effective lagrangian with normal 4d lagrangian for gauge subgroup h , we can obtain the relation between 4d and 5d gauge coupling constants , @xmath45    now we introduce the brane kinetic terms in the 5d lagrangian , @xmath46~,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath47 represent the generators of @xmath5 and @xmath12 gauge group respectively , that is , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then , the new effective 4d lagrangian of @xmath5 gauge part is given by @xmath50 after re - scaling followed by the same way shown above , we obtain a little bit different relation compared to the previous one , @xmath51 where we introduced a new constant factor @xmath52 like usual renormalization constant in the last equality .",
    "similarly , we can also derive a relation between two gauge couplings for @xmath12 part as follows , @xmath53 and each @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 it is worthwhile to notice that those brane kinetic terms can modify each gauge coupling of @xmath5 and @xmath12 by the re - scaling of the gauge fields . in fact , the numerical factor @xmath56 comes from the structure constant of @xmath15 , and in general we can calculate this important number by using group theoretic analysis depending on symmetry breaking patterns of given models . finally the 4d effective lagrangian is written by @xmath57 therefore , we can identify @xmath58 as the gauge coupling @xmath59 of @xmath5 and @xmath60 as the gauge coupling @xmath61 of @xmath12 .",
    "the weak mixing angle is then presented by @xmath62 in the case of @xmath63 ( namely , @xmath64 ) , the value of @xmath65 becomes @xmath56 which is one of the well - known results for the @xmath15 ghu model .    before ending up this section",
    ", we shortly give a comment on two problems existed in the 5d @xmath15 ghu model .",
    "first , since any higgs potential can not be generated at tree level due to the higher dimensional gauge symmetry and absence of the quartic couplings , a mechanism should be contrived to construct suitable higgs potential .",
    "second , even though some mechanisms work correctly to generate it , the size of the quantum corrections may not be enough to generate a few hundred gev scale of top quark and the higgs scalar masses . in the next sections",
    ", we will show how those two problems can be naturally solved when we extend space - time to 6 dimensions(or more higher dimensions ) in the ghu scheme .",
    "we consider general ghu models with arbitrary gauge group @xmath66 defined by 4+n space time , @xmath67 , with usual 4d minkowskian manifold @xmath68 and a discrete group @xmath69 acting on extra dimension @xmath70 , whose lagrangian is given by @xcite , @xmath71 here , we assume that the actions of 4+n dimensional gauge field @xmath72 under @xmath69 operations on @xmath70 behave as follows ; @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent rotation and translation vectors , respectively . in order for the lagrangian to be invariant under general operations including reflection , rotation , translation on extra compactified spaces , the matrices @xmath77 must satisfy following properties : @xmath78 since there exist two eigenvalues @xmath79 or @xmath80 of @xmath77 under orbifold projection @xmath81",
    ", we can divide all operators into two types , @xmath82 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath83 and @xmath84 corresponding to -1 .",
    "it is also known that the zero modes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 that should have neumann boundary conditions under the translation , @xmath85 , must satisfy  @xcite @xmath86 from these relations , we see that the zero modes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 have the eigenvalue @xmath83 under the above translation . combining this operator with the orbifold projection , we introduce two operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 with the index @xmath89 implying eigenvalue @xmath83 for the above translation . then , the commutation relations  @xcite among generators are given by @xmath90 \\subset n^{+},~[n^{+},n^{+ } ] \\subset p^{+},~[n^{+},r ] \\subset r~,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is a set of remaining generators of @xmath66 . for a 5d @xmath15 toy model on an orbifold @xmath92 , @xmath93    now we present",
    "lie algebra and its conventions in a specific canonical basis satisfying @xmath94=\\beta e_{\\beta } , ~~[e_{\\beta},e_{-\\beta}]=\\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{c } \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ e_{\\beta},e_{\\gamma } ] = n_{\\beta,\\gamma}e_{\\beta+\\gamma}~~\\mathrm{if~\\beta+\\gamma\\neq0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is a vector of cartan generators ( or sometimes @xmath96 is denoted as a component of a cartan generator ) , and @xmath97 is a root generator corresponding raising or lowering operator , and @xmath98 are structure constants . note that the structure constants in this basis are not totally symmetric .",
    "the roots of given original bulk gauge group @xmath66 denoted by @xmath99 from now on can be chosen as generators of the @xmath5 , whereas the generator of hypercharge @xmath100 can be a linear combination of cartan generators denoted by @xmath101 .",
    "then , we obtain the following relations , @xmath102      in order for ghu models to be phenomenologically viable , the following four requirements should be satisfied  @xcite ; ( 1 ) all simple roots should be either isodoublets or isosinglets , ( 2 ) all isosinglets should have zero hypercharge , ( 3 ) all isodoublets should have the same non - zero hypercharge , ( 4 ) fermion representations with hypercharge 1/6 should be contained . note that among these requirements , the fourth one reflects the spirit of the grand unified theories .",
    "henceforth , we will only concentrate on the ghu models which can satisfy above four requirements . when we consider those , it is sufficient to deal with simple roots only since we can always transform the root to one specific simple root among other simple roots by using suitable permutation and inversions of some axes .",
    "now , let us consider the general forms of the mass matrix of vector - boson divided by two types corresponding to two generators @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is a field corresponding to extra spatial components , and the @xmath107 fields correspond to 4d scalars . using eq.([an ] ) , the term @xmath108^{2}$ ] becomes @xmath109 supposing that the 4d scalar gets a vacuum expectation value from the effective potential and using @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the form of eq.([an2 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath112 and the weak mixing angle is given by @xmath113    let us now consider the effect of the brane kinetic terms in the general case .",
    "as learnt from the @xmath15 toy model described in the previous section , these brane kinetic terms we introduced can shift the coupling constants of @xmath5 and @xmath12 in the same way .",
    "re - scaling the gauge coupling constants , the term leading to the higgs mass is written by @xmath114~,\\ ] ] and the weak mixing relation is given by @xmath115 similar to the case of 5d @xmath15 toy model , the weak mixing angle is largely deviated from the experimental result ( @xmath116 ) even in the case of @xmath63 in any gauge group except for @xmath8 and @xmath117 as can be seen in table .  [",
    "tab : table1 ] . in the ghu models ,",
    "it is difficult to remedy this problem by incorporating the warped space time like rs1  @xcite mainly due to the flat profiles corresponding zero modes as the sm gauge bosons before the ewsb .",
    "until now there have been two more well - known prescriptions to cure the probelm besides introducing the brane kinetic terms ; one is to use non - simple lie group like a product group , @xmath118 or @xmath119 , where @xmath120 means an anomalous u(1 ) that does have unclear origin in some cases , and the other is to let each original group live in different extra dimension that has different volume size , @xmath121 .",
    "consequently those methods including brane kinetic terms can easily lead to the shift of each gauge coupling as much as we want .",
    "now , let us show that there exists a correlation between @xmath122 and @xmath123 . rewriting eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing angle ] ) in terms of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , we can obtain the following relation @xmath124 for a given group theoretic numerical factor , the values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 should be chosen to be consistent with the present experiment value of the weak mixing angle .",
    "the correlations between @xmath122 and @xmath123 in 6d @xmath15 and @xmath8 ghu models on @xmath127 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccp ] . in the figure ,",
    "the straight , dashed and dotted lines correspond to the compactification scale @xmath128 to be 5 , 10 and 20 tev , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath129 as the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "one can easy see from fig .",
    "[ fig : ccp ] that the slope of the lines for @xmath8 is steeper than that for @xmath15 because the predicted value of @xmath130 @xmath131 in @xmath8 is smaller than that @xmath132 in @xmath15 , and the slopes of the lines are independent of the volume factor .",
    "the volume factors only change the value of @xmath123 depending on the scale @xmath133 , as can be seen in both panels .",
    "especially , the bottom panel shows that the scale dependence of the lines disappears for @xmath134 tev in the case of @xmath8 .     and",
    "@xmath126 for @xmath129 @xcite and each group theoretic numerical factor in 6d @xmath15 and @xmath8 gauge higgs unification models on @xmath127 .",

    "the straight , dashed and dotted lines correspond to the compactification scale @xmath128 to be 5 , 10 and 20 tev , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    finally , let us draw our attention to the higgs mass .",
    "we assume that the higgs potential is given by @xmath135 as is well known , there are two methods for the higgs scalar to get its mass .",
    "one is to use wilson loops along extra dimensions .",
    "especially , when the extra dimensional manifold is not simply connected , that is , @xmath136 , the wilson loop gets additional phases and the 4d fluctuations of the phase become the higgs field . however , one - loop generated higgs mass is in general too small , even smaller than w boson mass in this case .",
    "the other is to consider 6d theory with background fields . in this case , the quartic coupling of the higgs scalar is naturally generated from higher dimensional non - abelian gauge group , for instance , @xmath137 .",
    "the negative quadratic term of the higgs potential demanded to trigger the ewsb can be generated by the interaction between the original gauge field and background fields , @xmath138)$ ] .",
    "note that the higgs mass in latter case can be large enough because the terms in the higgs potentail are generated at the tree level unlike the former case .",
    "so we necessarily consider the 6d models and even more higher dimensional models from now on .",
    "after the higgs scalar gets vacuum expectation value , @xmath139 , we can easily calculate the masses of higgs and w boson , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "thanks to the gauge kinetic terms , the ratio between the higgs and w boson masses is given by @xmath142 where we have taked the quartic coupling @xmath143 to be equal to @xmath144 .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the above relation is almost independent of how the @xmath145 term generates and the exact magnitude of the vev . in addition , extension to higher dimensional space does not affect the relation itself .",
    "it is only sufficient to trace gauge group breaking pattern from one simple group at the high energy to the sm gauge groups at the low energy , and estimate a simple volume factor of fundamental domain of the orbifolds . since @xmath52 ( or @xmath122 ) is written in term of @xmath36 ( or @xmath123 ) by @xmath146 the ratio given in eq.([wh ] ) is rewritten by @xmath147 from the fact that all gauge couplings come from one gauge coupling in higher dimension , one can see why the ratio only depends on one variable @xmath123 .",
    "thus , one can easily achieve the experimental value of weak mixing angle by adjusting those two parameters @xmath148 appropriately .",
    "we make numerical analysis in the ghu models with phenomenologically viable simple lie groups satisfying four low energy constraints given in the previous section whose simple root @xmath99 and member y of cartan subalgebra correspond to the sm gauge groups @xmath5 and @xmath12 , respectively  @xcite . the numerical results for the weak mixing angle as well as the higgs mass are presented in table [ tab : table1 ] . in the numerical calculation , we take @xmath149 gev and @xmath150 as inputs . as can be seen from table i , the higgs masses are predicted to be below the current lower bound the 114.4 gev @xcite in the case of @xmath151 for all groups .",
    ".simple lie groups satisfying four low energy constraints  @xcite and their predictions of the higgs mass in the case of @xmath151 , where @xmath99 and @xmath152 correspond to @xmath5 weak and @xmath12 hypercharge groups of the standard model , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting that the slope of the curve becomes very small as the number of dimension increases . fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] shows how the predictions of the higgs mass for the cases of the 7 d @xmath6 and the 8 d @xmath7 can change compared to those in the case of 6 d. we see that only @xmath8 in the case of 7 d ( the upper one ) leads for the higgs mass to lie above the current lower bound on the higgs masses , whereas other groups demand very large values of @xmath126 so as for the higgs mass to be consistent with the current lower bound for @xmath153 tev .",
    "however , in the 8 d case , the higgs masses for all groups weakly depend on the value of @xmath126 and lie below the lower bound .",
    "therefore , any 8 d ghu models with @xmath154 tev can not simultaneously accommodate the weak mixing angle and the higgs mass coming from experiments without taking very large value of @xmath123 which looks rather unnatural .",
    "consequently , we can conclude that rather large value of @xmath133 is necessarily demanded to accommodate the current experimental data in higher - dimensional ghu models .",
    "for various groups and @xmath155 tev in the 7d ghu model on @xmath156(upper panel ) and 8d ghu model on @xmath7(bottom panel).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]   for various groups and @xmath155 tev in the 7d ghu model on @xmath156(upper panel ) and 8d ghu model on @xmath7(bottom panel).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in summary , we have shown that the measured value of the weak mixing angle can be achieved by introducing the brane kinetic terms in ghu models .",
    "interesting points that we found from our numerical results are as follows ;    * a modified relation between the higgs and @xmath16 boson masses is derived . *",
    "the current lower bound on the higgs mass tends to favor exceptional groups @xmath0 than other @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 groups irrespective of the compactification scale @xmath128 .",
    "the largest higgs mass above the lower bound is achieved in @xmath8 among all groups we consider .",
    "* the predictions of the higgs masses in the models for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 groups can be consistent with the curent lower bound only when @xmath128 is higher than 1 tev and @xmath126 is taken to be unnaturally large value . * for higher dimensional models such as 7d @xmath6 and 8d @xmath7 ,",
    "it is possible to get the higgs mass consistent with the current lower bound without taking unnaturally large value of @xmath126 as long as @xmath128 is taken to be higher than 1 tev .",
    "interestingly enough , the higher rank @xmath8 ghu model can be a remnant of one fundamental theory like the string theory whose gauge structure is @xmath157 at very high energy scale , since @xmath8 ghu model with brane kinetic terms can be viable at even lower compactification scales below 1 tev .",
    "finally we anticipate that a great signal about the higgs boson(or sector ) detected soon at the large hadron collider(lhc ) would reveal the secret of electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of the mass generation beyond the sm , and eventually judge which model has been chosen by nature .",

    "<S> we show that the idea of gauge - higgs unification(ghu ) can be rescued from the constraint of weak mixing angle by introducing localized brane kinetic terms in higher dimensional ghu models with bulk and simple gauge groups . </S>",
    "<S> we find that those terms lead to a ratio between higgs and w boson masses , which is a little bit deviated from the one derived in the standard model . from numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the current lower bound on the higgs mass tends to prefer to exceptional groups @xmath0 rather than other groups like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 in 6-dimensional ( d ) ghu models irrespective of the compactification scales . </S>",
    "<S> for the compactification scale below 1 tev , the higgs masses in 6d ghu models with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 groups are predicted to be less than the current lower bound unless a model parameter responsible for re - scaling @xmath5 gauge coupling is taken to be unnaturally large enough . to see how the situation is changed in more higher dimensional ghu model , we take 7d @xmath6 and 8d @xmath7 models . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out from our numerical analysis that these higher dimensional ghu models with gauge groups except for @xmath8 can lead to the higgs boson whose masses are predicted to be above the current lower bound only for the compatification scale above 1 tev without taking unnaturally large value of the model parameter , whereas the higgs masses in the ghu models with @xmath8 are compatible with the current lower bound even for the compatification scale below 1 tev . </S>",
