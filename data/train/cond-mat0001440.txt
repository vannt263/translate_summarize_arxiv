    "in the theory of critical phenomena , continuous phase transitions can be classified into universality classes determined only by a few basic properties characterizing the system , such as the space dimensionality , the range of interaction , the number of components and the symmetry of the order parameter .",

    "the above procedure implies global ( i.e.  @xmath142-independent ) stationarity , and as a consequence all physical amplitudes turn out to be stationary with respect to variations of @xmath131 and @xmath141 .",
    "these statements are fairly general , but it is certainly interesting to consider the first few non trivial examples . for the lowest order truncation of @xmath9 we may adopt the parametrization @xmath143 which includes both the ising model in three dimensions ( @xmath144 ) and general @xmath145 symmetric models with goldstone bosons in @xmath146 dimensions ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "it is easy to recognize that the following relationship must then hold : @xmath148 global stationarity implies that the stability conditions may be extracted from the variation of any physical quantity .",
    "in particular we may concentrate on the universal zero of @xmath106 , @xmath149 , noting that @xmath150 , cf .",
    "( [ thzrel ] ) . as a consequence of the above results ,",
    "the simplest models can all be described by the parametrization @xmath151 let us first consider the case @xmath152 .",
    "the minimization procedure leads to @xmath153 setting @xmath144 one immediately recognizes the linear parametric model representation for the ising model @xcite . unfortunately when @xmath154 the solution is not physically satisfactory , because it gives @xmath155 for all @xmath156 , and therefore the scheme is useless for models with goldstone singularities .",
    "let us now include @xmath157 .",
    "requiring @xmath149 to be stationary with respect to variations of both parameters , we obtain @xmath158 implying also @xmath159 in the ising model the above solution reduces to @xmath160 note that , substituting the physical values of the critical exponents @xmath74 and @xmath161 for the @xmath162 model , @xmath157 turns out to be a very small number ( @xmath163 ) and the predicted numerical value of @xmath149 is 2.8475 , consistent within @xmath164 with the linear parametric model prediction  @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say that in the ising case the above solution has a status which is comparable to the linear parametric model , both conceptually and in terms of predicting power .",
    "it is therefore possible to take it as the starting point of an alternative approximation scheme whose higher - order truncations might prove quite effective .",
    "unfortunately when we consider the @xmath0 system , setting @xmath154 and choosing the values of the exponents pertaining to @xmath65 , the value of @xmath157 becomes too large for the approximation to be sensible .",
    "indeed we get @xmath165 and all testable predictions turn out to be far away from the corresponding physical values .",
    "it is however worth exploring the features of this approach because , as we shall show , it has formal properties which might prove useful when considering parametric representations of the equation of state for higher values of @xmath62 .",
    "let us indeed consider the function @xmath100 entering the parametric representation of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we know that this function will in general show singularities in the complex @xmath142 plane corresponding to the zeroes of the function @xmath98 . however , when substituting the expressions of @xmath126 and @xmath130 obtained from the saddle - point evaluation of the parameters @xmath131 , @xmath101 and @xmath157 , after some simple manipulations , we find out that all singularities cancel and @xmath166 this fact was already observed in the case @xmath152 for all values of the truncation order @xmath31",
    ". therefore , the stationarity prescription is a way to ensure a higher degree of regularity in the parametric representation of thermodynamic functions .    finally , let us observe that the stationary solution can be applied to the large-@xmath62 limit of @xmath145 models in any dimension @xmath167 . in this limit @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "as a consequence we obtain from our previous results @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , implying also @xmath173 we therefore obtained an exact parametrization of the equation of state in the large-@xmath62 limit for all @xmath146 .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large values of @xmath62 , the scheme we have defined may be a sensible starting point for the parametric representation of the thermodynamical functions in the critical domain .",
