    "although there have been many attempts to interpret the causality principle of quantum theory @xcite , nelson s work @xcite stands alone @xcite .",
    "nelson approaches the schrdinger equation in essence with stochastic mechanics as an open system , but he also used a non - friction model , thus there is no energy or mass transfers on average and the system can be kept as a closed system .",
    "nonetheless , grabert _ et .",
    "@xcite showed that quantum mechanics is not equivalent to a markovian diffusion processes , followed later by gillaspie @xcite who also demonstrated that the measurable behavior of most quantum system can not be modeled as a markov process .",
    "skorobogatov and svertilov @xcite also pointed out that the measurable behavior of elementary quantum system can be modeled by non - markovian stochastic processes .",
    "stochastic interpretations , although they are based on the same fundamental idea on the existence of fluctuating field as background , have two major different viewpoints is considering the collapse of the wave function in the context of how we reconcile the probabilistic distribution of outcomes with deterministic form of schrdinger equation when the measurement is made .",
    "first , one views that when the measurement is made , the system will become an open system .",
    "this proposal serves the main idea of decoherence and de broglie - bohm interpretations on `` measurement problem '' is designated to keep the deterministic property of schrdinger equation .",
    "second , one poses that the state collapse into macroscopically unique state @xcite occurs dynamically because the wave function ( internal mass density ) is coupled to a brownian motion noise term .",
    "this approach assumes that quantum mechanics is not exact from the beginning ( before measurement is made ) . from a fundamental point of view , decoherence and",
    "de broglie - bohm interpretations have a problem in describing `` reality '' because it is just only one apparatus that exists in reality , while the dynamical collapse models do not explain the role of measurement well . + stochastic models with causality interpretations have been facing several challenges ( questions ) such as : 1 .",
    "what is the origin of the non - classical force ( related to osmotic velocity ) acting on the particle or what is the origin of the quantum mechanical potential @xcite ?",
    ", quantity that related to internal motion @xcite ; 2 . to derive stochastic models",
    ", one must introduce the diffusion constant by heuristic arguments , even though it has been shown that the schrdinger equation and diffusion equations are equivalent in a mathematical structure @xcite .",
    "the constant of diffusion expressed by planck constant and mass has delivered a fundamental question : what is the natural significance of the planck constant and its connection with mass concept in determining diffusion constant ?",
    "3 . a realistic explanation of quantum mechanics has to meet at least one of the three requirements that is the charge of a particle is concentrated in a small volume of space @xcite .",
    "4 . nelson s model for stationery state",
    "contains the nodal surface caused by osmotic velocity that is inversely proportional to the probability density .",
    "stochastic models have not expressed yet an obvious picture of natural spin ( a physical mechanism picture ) that has been identified to play a fundamental role to determine the quantum behavior of micro - systems @xcite .",
    "on the another word , stochastic models is not dealing with the existence of _ zitterbewegung _ that support proposal on splitting the motion of variables into two kinds of motion that are the motion of the center of mass to a chosen reference frame and internal motion with reference to the center of mass @xcite .    besides the measurement problem in the foundation of quantum theory , mass , behind its role as the most fundamental notion underlying physics to perceive and to conceptualize relations among all physical phenomena ,",
    "has not yet been fully understood and explained .",
    "fundamentally , the definition of mass is not only present in classical - relativity with terms inertial mass and relativistic mass as well as gravitation mass , but also found in quantum theory in its connection with the density of probability or the wave function .",
    "the unclear ontology role of mass to unify our understanding on what truly goes on in physical realm indicates that the concepts of mass are simply not complete .",
    "it means that definition of mass still open to be redefined and extended for unified purposes of consistently creating a natural picture .",
    "the definition , of course , should be derived from a new theory with which we can explain the origin , the existence and the phenomenological properties of mass , as well as the fundamental source of unpredictability and the measurement problem in quantum theory at once .    in this work ,",
    "we pose a unified description on both the fundamental motion of particles and particle masses in the new stochastic process framework in order to produce a natural explanation of spin . from the proposal",
    ", we describe what happens to the particle when a measurement is made , what the relation between the deterministic evolution of the wave function and the probabilistic outcome from measurement is , and as well as what the connectivity between the particle and what its environment in the concentrated - energy context is .",
    "we also introduce a new meaning of special relativity theory in dynamics viewpoint and its connection with internal atomic mechanism .",
    "the debate on the interpretation of quantum mechanics has taken place since the 1920s and continues to this day in both the scientific and philosophical communities .",
    "one of issues that has become central to the debate is the possible presence of the role that causality plays in microscopic world governed by the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "orthodox quantum theory known as the copenhagen interpretation , which is the prevailing theory of quantum mechanics , confronts with the causality principle based on the notion of cause and effect .",
    "they , anti - realism , have a notion that in quantum realm , particles do not acquire some of their characteristics until they are observed by someone @xcite .",
    "contrary to orthodox quantum theory , attempts to understand quantum theory in the classic understanding with the causality principle still continue in varying models .",
    "the original stochastic model ( a non - local theory ) was first introduced by bohm and vigier @xcite describing the random motion of the particle in madelung fluid .",
    "afterward , nelson @xcite attempted to discuss schrdinger equation in the universal brownian motion framework ( a local theory ) .",
    "stochastic interpretation by nelson @xcite claimed that the quantum mechanical motion of particles governed by the schrdinger equation can be equally understood as particles in classical brownian motion in a vacuum which acts upon the particle as does heat in the theory of irreversible processes @xcite .",
    "nelson s approach is different from those of fnyes @xcite and frth @xcite in that it uses an imaginary diffusion coefficient .",
    "contrary to the notion of bohm - vigier and nelson that viewing the wave function evolves in deterministic way , ghirardi , _ et .",
    "_ @xcite posed that the wave function interacts with background field fluctuations , therefore the probability outcome should include background field fluctuations . actually , the proposal of ghirardi , _ et .",
    "@xcite ( known as grw and cls models ) are not interpretation models of quantum theory , but rather , models to understand measurement problem .",
    "if we trace stochastic models , we will find out that almost all them use closely similar causal interpretations , which are    1 .",
    "the change in trajectory of an object ( a particle ) is continuous and that in instant of time it has some definite positions @xcite .",
    "2 .   vacuum fluctuation plays a central role in determining diffusion and random processes .",
    "here we introduce a new fundamental mechanism of the motion of a particle that is entirely different from the previous models .",
    "although we build our model in terms of random motion ( the change of motion trajectories ) , fundamentally , we have radically departed from traditional views .",
    "we pose that random motion in a quantum system is an intrinsic property of particles , and this motion is naturally caused by concentrated energy localized as a particle .",
    "it means that localized energy will play a role as quantum potential .",
    "random motion takes place in a quantum - sized volume ( it is similar to random vibrating motion ) where this volume can move too , and then mass and charge distributed in the quantum - sized volume equal to the distribution of probability to find the particle in the quantum - sized volume .",
    "there are four mechanism introduced in our model , which are as follows .    1",
    ".   the particles will move randomly in a quantum - sized volume where the random motion serves an intrinsic property of particle and related to spin phenomena . in a stationer state ,",
    "random motion will relatively take place forward and backward in time with markovian process .",
    "nevertheless , because random motion takes place in limited area ( the quantum - sized volume ) that similar to random vibrating system , random motion does not present perspective on the diffusion process .",
    "2 .   relative to random intrinsic motion , the quantum - sized volume can undergo translational movement , but it can not take place backward in time at stationery state .",
    "the dynamics of the quantum - sized volume represent magnetic properties of angular or translational momentum , and it can represent de broglie - bohm theory on guiding particle .",
    "every change of the speed of random intrinsic motion accompanied or not by the change of the velocity of translational motion of a quantum - sized volume will represent the transition between two states , and every change of the speed of random intrinsic motion will generate a diffusion process or brownian motion perspective .",
    "the dissipative character of quantum systems in our model is similar to langevin s approach to brownian motion but with a different mechanism .",
    "the difference lies in the cause of emission or absorption process . in our model ,",
    "a particle will emit or absorb energy when the intrinsic speed of the particle and or the translational velocity of quantum - sized volume changes , and it is not related to a friction process .",
    "internal diffusion process coincide with emission and absorption processes which also occurs in backward and forward in time with a non - markovian process ( as long as the system does not undergo phase transition ) .",
    "4 .   for more any complex physical system ( material )",
    ", the quantum - sized volume can probably move in two ways that are transitional or random motions , and it will be determined by the potential forms of system ( material ) .    if we consider the kinematic aspects of the transition process ( how the particle moves from one point to other point , i.e. how its position changes in time ) ; for example , a case where transition processes include diffusion process and the movement of the quantum - sized volume , then the movement path of the particle at any time will be determined by the velocity of the quantum - sized volume , the distribution of the velocity field in the quantum - sized volume describing how the particle relatively moves from the center of quantum - sized volume , and the displacement due to the diffusion process .",
    "we can represent the forward time operator for describing how the average position of the particle changes in time when the transition process followed by emitting energy occurs ( the speed of the intrinsic motion in the quantum - sized volume decreases ) as @xcite : @xmath2 while the backward time operator for the case of absorbing energy followed by the increase of the speed of the quantum - sized volume is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the diffusion constant .",
    "if we consider a transition process followed by emitting energy . then @xmath5 is the initial velocity field of a stationer state and @xmath6 is a relatively final velocity where @xmath7 .",
    "next we consider langevin s equation describing energy emission when a particle undergoes a transition process generated by applying an external force ( an external potential ) .",
    "we assume if the physical system does not undergo emission or absorption processes , then every particle of any physical system is in stationary states .",
    "if an external force ( an external field ) is applied to any physical system being in any stationary state where energy of the external field is equal to the gap energy between stationary states so that the interaction will produce emission or absorption processes ( between ) as long as the interaction do nt cause any phase transition . in such process ,",
    "the set of possible stationary states of the physical system do not change by external field .",
    "but , if any applied external field do not generate transition process ( diffusion processes : emission or absorption processes ) , then the physical system will respond to the presence of the external field by creating a new stationary state characterized by changing its particle positions and kinetics so that all new possible states produced by the external potential are different from previous possible stationary states ( without any external field ) .",
    "our starting point to consider any physical system at the stationery state is based on the historical facts that quantum theory was develop to understand the behaviors and the properties of atom and molecule as well as other stationer physical systems .",
    "we apply langevin s equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath11 $ ] is the total acceleration where @xmath12 is the acceleration of the quantum - sized volume and @xmath13 is the acceleration of particle in the quantum - sized volume relative to the center of volume , @xmath14 is the force governing the stationer state of the quantum - sized volume [ we can also consider an ideal condition in which @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the applied force for generating transition process , and @xmath17 is random force that in the conventional view is asserted to represent the effect of background noise , but in our model , by contrast , we pose this force only represent an intrinsic internal random motion .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) in terms of velocity as @xmath18 where @xmath19 . applying average forward time derivative to eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , we find that @xmath20 whereas for average back forward time derivative to eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , we find @xmath21 @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) shows that diffusion processes representing emission and absorption processes are caused by @xmath16 , thus , the absence of @xmath16 represents the physical system is in stationary state .",
    "seeing eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , it seems that the two equations describe ambiguous mechanisms .",
    "it is because the two equations use the same forces to describe two difference mechanisms .",
    "we can understand it with following description .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) depicts external force applied on a particle occupying a stationary state with potential @xmath23 and then makes the particle undergo a friction force ( emission process ) .",
    "basically , this process will create the change of internal potential where the change of internal potential will be the same as the external force .",
    "thus we can still consider eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) as a backward process with the same internal potential and the same external force , but it takes place spontaneously ( without external treatment ) . from this point of view",
    ", we can view the spontaneously emitting or absorbing processes as backward processes as long as the system does not undergo a phase transition . since backward processes play a role as a natural tendency to bring final states ( as the results of forward process ) back to initial states ( before there are external treatments ) so that we pose that there are neither spontaneously emitting or absorbing processes without interaction between any physical system and external treatment or perturbation .",
    "thus the information of any dynamic system must only be acquired and accessed by applying external treatment to any physical systems occupying stationary states . using the mean forward derivative ( [ 1 ] ) and the mean backward derivative ( [ 2 ] ) introduced by @xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) give @xmath24 where @xmath9 .",
    "for stationer state @xmath25 and @xmath26 $ ] , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) becomes @xmath27",
    "if we assume that an obvious connection between the microscopic ( quantum realm ) and macroscopic worlds ( classical picture ) exists , then every proposed theory must not only reveal the unfinished understanding of how quantum realm is more obscure than our daily imagination and physical sense that perceive physical phenomena based on both conventional models about particle , interactions and concepts of mass , charge , field and energy in which all those physical concepts and models constitute physical pictures via mechanisms obeying causality principle .",
    "but , the proposal must also solve the polemic about whether mass and charge are no more than the abstract quantitative expression of facts that do not need to explain phenomena in terms of purposes or hidden causes like weyl s and mach opinion on mass definition @xcite . in our opinion",
    ", the existence of a hidden connection between the quantum and the classical realms may be caused by the fundamentally unenviable approach of describing the fundamental attributes of physical objects that have been causing and afterward shaping our incomplete perspective in understanding all physical phenomena and relations among them such as mass , time , force , field , interaction , etc .",
    "on of the fundamental concepts that has not been established yet is the concept of mass .",
    "how modern physics has both experimentally and theoretically contributed to a more profound understanding of the nature of mass has been comprehensively summarized and reported by max jammer in ref .",
    "mass was formally introduced by newton in his second law of dynamic to depict the dynamics of physical object via the relation of force and acceleration .",
    "this description has provided the inertial feature of physical objects .",
    "newton also presented the gravity mass to describe the ability of matter to generate the phenomenon of gravity force .",
    "afterward , the meaning of mass was amended by einstein when he introduced special relativity theory extends our understanding of mass through the differentiation of rest mass and relativistic mass .",
    "nevertheless the debate on the rest mass versus relativistic mass still exists until now @xcite",
    ". an important aspect of einstein s work has been the relation of energy and mass which leads to the perspective of a particle s mass at the rest as concentrated energy .",
    "einstein s contribution to the perspective of mass also included a unified description of inertial mass and gravity mass when he worked on general relativity . in this context",
    ", mass is extended as a key factor governing the structure of space - time .",
    "although einstein had created a fundamental picture of the particle as concentrated energy using the term of the speed of light ( the relation between mass and energy ) , the results can not link the description of mass - energy with the origin of the electromagnetic field or the charge of the particle , another important physical concept which provides a perspective of the electromagnetic wave and its energy . the kinematic approach introduced by einstein",
    "has not yet provided a complete description on what the meaning of electric and magnetic fields in relation to the mass feature of the charge particle is .",
    "another missing explanation has been what the picture of the physical mechanisms on how electrical fields transform to magnetic fields or conversely when a charged particle moves ( following the perspective of kinetic energy between two frames of reference ) ? ; what is the effect of radiation ( the production of photon ) in regards to the mass of charged particle when the particle is accelerated ? ; how clock and length are connected with the atom and many body problems @xcite ; until how energy is stored as bounding state and how it is released as electromagnetic field or photon .",
    "we view that non - unified description of the electromagnetic and mechanical aspects of a particle is the source of an unfinished - description on electromagnetic interaction and also the source of a debate on what is the physically invariant quantity or not ?    here , we pose a new description of mass that is a totally different from the conventional approaches .",
    "first , we give two backgrounds to our proposal .    1 .   from our model on the fundamental motion of a particle",
    ", we can identify that random motion in the quantum - sized volume is the intrinsic property of the particle , hence the terminology of energy ( quantum potential ) generating intrinsic motion should be connected to concentrated energy `` rest mass '' as in the special relativity theory perspective .",
    "2 .   because the concentrated energy of the particle must decrease and increase by emission and absorption processes by external treatment , the amount of quantified - energy emitted or absorbed must relatively be representative of the structure and motion of the particle due to the existence of system ( other particles / environment ) .",
    "this also means that energy related to transition processes will represent how other particles as an environment relatively evolves and changes with time towards the particle as a frame of reference .",
    "conversely , transition processes will describe how the particle relatively evolves and changes with time toward their environment ( how their potential and kinetic terms relatively change toward the other particle ) .    to construct a new model based on the two possibilities above",
    ", we pose that :    1 .",
    "the elementary particle is 3-dimensional sphere - form ( 2-manifold without boundary ) where natural energy will occupy at the surface ( a concentrated - energy system ) .",
    "2 .   when there is no perspective about system ( environment ) particle in absolute vacuum , energy occupying the surface of the particle makes the particle move randomly and rotate about its axis ( spin motion ) where the speeds of both translational random motion and internal angular motion is at the speed of light .",
    "the two kinds of fundamental particle motions take place in a quantum - sized volume as our previous model on fundamental of the particle .",
    "3 .   random motion taking place in the quantum - sized volume allows the motion of the particle to be considered as a randomly vibrating - movement .",
    "4 .   we defined mass as the amount of energy per unit of surface area of the particle per its vibration and rotating frequencies , and the value of the mass of the particle is always constant for every state : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is light velocity field , @xmath30 is mass tensor ( in any time interval ) , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively are vibration and rotational frequencies , @xmath33 is the surface of the fundamental particle , and @xmath34 is a vector field where its scalar represents the radius of sphere and its direction of random vibrating motion . if we pose that @xmath35 and @xmath30 are invariant to all frame of references so that @xmath36 will be invariant quantity caused by the invariance of mass quantity .",
    "5 .   the concentrated energy of the particle at every state , for every physical system",
    ", must always be at a certain value that is less than that of its value when there is no interaction perspective ( a particle is in absolute vacuum ) , whereas the loss of the concentrated energy of the particle will be transformed into the presence of any physical system as expressed by potential terms and kinetics terms and the changes of the speed of internal random motion to lower than the speed of light where the speed of the random motion in whatever kinds of physical systems must always be lower than the speed of light .",
    "thus , interactions and transition states will only change the potential terms and or kinetics terms and or the speed of random motion .",
    "for example , the equation of the invariant mass of an atom consisting of @xmath37 electrons undergoing a transition process can be expressed by eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and [ 10 ] : consider an electron of the atom is at a stationery state ; so invariant mass principle requires + @xmath38 + where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is the coulomb potential of the electron relatively to the nucleus , @xmath42 is the coulomb potential of an electron relative to the @xmath37 other electrons , and @xmath43 is kinetic energy relative to both the nucleus and the @xmath37 other electrons . + afterward if the particle undergoes emitting or absorbing processes with transition energy @xmath44 , the velocity field will change to keep the invariance of mass and eq . ( [ 9 ] ) becomes @xmath45 and the system will occupy a new state @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the energies that have been transformed by the particle to create any physical system .",
    "when any transition process takes place with either emitting or absorbing processes , so the atom will rearrange itself through the change of potential terms and/or kinetic terms and the speed of random motion in the quantum - sized volume .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) represent the invariant mass principle when a transition process takes place , and propose that every @xmath49 can be generated by any combination of both a set @xmath50 and every combination of the subset of @xmath50 , whereas every combination accompanying emitting or absorbing process will describe every possibility of interaction potential terms or coupling terms in the atom system . for the realistic model of an atom",
    "in which its concentrated - energy also represents the existence of environment expressed by fluctuating - field so that invariant mass principle requires that : @xmath51 + thus @xmath52 can be transformed into any combination of either a set @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and every combination of the subset of @xmath55 where every combination accompanying the emitting or absorbing processes will describe every possibility of the interaction potential terms or coupling terms , and connection between @xmath56 and @xmath57 has been considered as either markovian or non - markovian processes .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the period fields of the randomly vibrating - movement of the particle in the quantum - sized volume and it will play a role as the time interval unit for previous and new states .",
    "+ on of the most important things from invariant mass principle is that it is possible for every physical system to evolve in time without undergoing an emission or absorption process as long as the changes do not alter the total @xmath60 of each particle of the system , or the energy particle is constant , or even can take place by emission or absorption processes but the total amount of @xmath60 does change on average .    from both proposal of the fundamental motion of the particle and the new concept of mass , it seems that there are two possible mechanisms that act as the sources of unpredictability of measurement outcome :    1 .   random motion taking place in the quantum - sized volume .",
    "( internal random motion makes physical observables asserted and coupled with position will have statistical features ) .",
    "2 .   macroscopic fluctuations , such as all process that happen in the universe including instrument states . although the average macroscopic fluctuation do not change the stationary state of particles ( any physical system ) , they will contribute to the outcome probabilities .",
    "to derive the diffusion constant of the particle , we consider a transition process where the particle emits energy to coincide with doing a diffusion process taking place in the quantum - sized volume .",
    "first , we consider that the particle is in a state without any kind of interaction or any kind of system or environment perspective , so that the relation between the concentrated - energy and the value of mass will be @xmath61 when the particle makes the transition process to occupy a new state to form a new simple physical system consisting of two particles with no kinetic term of the quantum - sized volume , so we can write the process in a simple equation as @xmath62 @xmath63 shows the two particles have different types of charge and @xmath64 is the kinetic energy of the particle in the quantum - sized volume . because the particle undergoes a diffusion process in the quantum - sized volume , work that is equivalent to the displacement by diffusion process is expressed by @xmath65   \\nonumber \\\\                      & = \\delta e^{~}_{\\mathrm{transition } } - e.              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] negative work means that the emission process is generated by the environment , such as the friction process in the perspective of langevin s equation .",
    "the process in eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) can be considered from langevin s equation with force    @xmath66    using the definition of work @xmath67 with @xmath68 we obtain @xmath69    in eq .",
    "( [ 14a ] ) , @xmath70 is the random forces that are produced by the collision between the particle and a medium , but because random motion , in our model , is an intrinsic properties of the particle , @xmath71 .",

    "this approach is totally different from conventional brownian motion models , which view the displacement of the particle for time - dependent cases and this is only generated by the diffusion process and velocity of brownian motion .    in our model",

    "our interpretation shows that internal random motion exhibiting random vibrating system and determining internal time interval unit ( proper time ) for states must play a fundamental role in relativistic effects and it can depict the change of both potential and kinetic terms as well as the transition energy of the particle .",
    "furthermore , from the seeking relation between mass and electric - magnetic fields , we have posed its tendency to attract particles of the same charges or repel different charges .",
    "based on this viewpoint , we can understand the magnetic energy ( magnetic field ) as the lost of the particle s tendency for having minimum concentrated - energy @xmath35 caused by the increase of the particle s velocity ( the kinetic energy of particles ) .",

    "the increase of kinetic energy ( the increase of magnetic field ) that is felt by one particle can be felt as the decrease of kinetic energy ( the increase of electric field ) by another particle .",
    "in addition to the proposal of a new basic - fundamental connection between mass and electromagnetic fields , we also found that if we view absorbed - radiated energy in terms of light , our model indicates that electromagnetic fields should be not directly represented by the absorbed - radiated energy . instead",
    ", electromagnetic fields should just represent the physical effects accompanying the process of absorbed - radiated energy generated by the transition process ( or , how environment responds to the change of the transition process ) where electromagnetic field can be used to determine the equivalence value of the amount of absorbed - radiated energy .",
    "we propose that if the electromagnetic wave must by the representation of wave properties of light , so must the pure radiated - absorbed energy represent the particle properties of the light .",
    "furthermore , because the particle is modeled as energy localized on the surface of dimensional sphere - form ( 2-manifold without boundary ) we can imagine that our real space may be composed of the space - particles sea where pure energy can be localized or propagated with particle properties .",
    "the mass feature of particles in our model is the physical condition generated by concentrated - energy located in the surface of 3-dimensional sphere - form . using this viewpoint",
    ", we can understand the environment or the existence of system as the condition accompanying the loss of concentrated - energy .",
    "thus , the total lost concentrated - energy from the particle must be compensated by the emergence of potentials and the kinetics terms as well as the change of velocity of internal random motion .",

    "we can also see that for the case of simple like an atom , the quantization of emitted absorbed energy will relate to states quantified by the potential and kinetic terms .",
    "the principle difference between our model and previous stochastic models lies in the causality of the emergence of random motion . in our model",
    ", we propose motion must be generated by concentrated - energy localized on the surface of a particle .",
    "therefore , we do not only need quantum potential ( external potential ) to generate internal motion but also a bath ( ether or vacuum fluctuation or a noise field background as the main source of fluctuation ) to generated random motion and diffusion . in our proposal concepts on mass",
    ", we view the background noise field [ eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) ] that depicts environmental fluctuation must exist to interact with a stationer system .",
    "the interactions do not change on average , the energy of the stationary system and only affect the probabilistic character of outcome .    in the context of the debate on how wave function evolves by the schrdinger equation in a predictable deterministic way , despite when a physical quantity is measured , the outcome is not predictable in advance @xcite , our model demonstrate that the quantum - sized volume `` bringing '' the probability density will evolve and coincide with transition processes in a predictable way .",
    "but , the information of physical quantity coupled with position ( direction ) is randomly stored in the quantum - sized volume , and because every measurement is a process to cause transition between states where this process is accompanied by the change of probability density to find the particle in the quantum - sized volume , thus , the measurement will determine the behavior of statistical outcome for every physical observable coupled to ( defined ) position ( direction ) .",
    "however the statistical outcome can also be generated by a background noise field or environment fluctuation and it does not affect on average to a stationer system . in regards to superposition of states ,",
