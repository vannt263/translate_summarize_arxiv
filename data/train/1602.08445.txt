    "phase  field models describe physical systems that can exhibit different homogeneous phases .",
    "the state of the system on the volume @xmath0 is coded into a so called phase ",
    "field @xmath1 depending on the space and time variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "two values of the phase  field , say @xmath4 and @xmath5 , represent the two homogeneous phases .",
    "these models play a crucial role , for instance , in the study of phase reordering @xcite : a system is quenched from the homogeneous high temperature phase into a broken  symmetry one ( a ferromagnet or a gas abruptly cooled below their critical temperature ) and the evolution of the phase ",
    "field @xmath6 describes the process of separation of the two phases .",
    "a straightforward way to derive the evolution equation for the field @xmath6 is that of assuming a gradient equation @xcite @xmath7 associated with the landau energy functional @xmath8{{\\normalfont\\textrm{d}}}x\\ ] ] where @xmath9 associates an energy with the phase ",
    "field @xmath6 and the squared  gradient term of the phase  field variations is weighted by the energy cost @xmath10 , called _ higher  order stiffness_. according to the usual physical interpretation the energy @xmath11 has to be chosen as a double well function with the two minima corresponding to the two phases @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "if the higher  order stiffness @xmath10 is a constant positive number and no constraint to the total value of the field @xmath6 is imposed , it is possible to compute the gradient of the landau functional in the hilbert space @xmath13 to get the _ standard _",
    "cahn equation @xmath14 with normal derivative of the phase ",
    "field on the boundary equal to zero .",
    "analogously the allen  cahn equation endowed with dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions could be derived specifying a  priori the proper essential boundary condition in the definition of the hilbert space in which the gradient of the landau functional should be computed .",
    "the standard allen  cahn equation , also called the time ",
    "dependent ginzburg ",
    "landau equation , was introduced in @xcite to describe the motion of anti  phase boundaries in crystalline solids . in this context",
    "@xmath6 represents the concentration of one of the two components of the alloy and @xmath10 is proportional to the squared interface width .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case in which the higher  order stiffness is not constant , but it is a sufficiently regular positive function of the field , namely , @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for any @xmath17 .",
    "this situation has been considered , for instance , in @xcite where the authors studied a similar model to describe glass  like relaxation in binary fluid models . a closely connected problem , in which a not constant higher ",
    "order stiffness is used , is the study of the gas  liquid interface in capillary tubes @xcite . in this case",
    ", the gradient equation provides the generalized allen  cahn equation , see appendix  [ s : ac ] , @xmath18 again with suitable conditions on the boundary @xmath19 .",
    "we focus on the one  dimensional case @xmath20 $ ] and study the solutions of the allen  cahn equation in the case in which the higher  order stiffness coefficient vanishes at the phases , namely , @xmath21 .",
    "as we shall discuss in the following section , in such a `` pathological '' case there exist stationary solutions connecting the two phases on a finite interval of length @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that this is not possible in the standard constant higher ",
    "order stiffness case , in which connections can only be considered on infinite domain @xcite .",
    "these solutions appeared in the scientific literature in different contexts , see , e.g. , @xcite , and have been called _ compactons _",
    ", in order to underline the property of being localized within a domain of finite measure .",
    "our main goal , here , is to study the behavior of the solutions of the evolution equation and , in particular , to describe the process leading to the formation of a compacton on the finite interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we shall discuss both the interface dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath23 and the homogeneous neumann boundary conditions @xmath24 we shall respectively refer to these two cases as to the ( d ) and ( n)boundary conditions .    let us summarize our main result . compactons can be used to construct stationary solutions of the allen  cahn equation performing many excursions between the two phases , whose total number is bounded by @xmath25 . in the standard allen  cahn stationary problem , i.e. , when the higher  order stiffness coefficient is constant , stationary profiles oscillating between the two phases are not allowed when ( d)boundary conditions are imposed . on the other hand , it is possible to construct profiles oscillating between two values of the phase ",
    "field @xmath6 `` close '' to the two pure phase values in the ( n)boundary condition case .",
    "these solutions , in the conservative mechanics equivalent model language in which the stationary allen  cahn model can be immediately recasted , correspond to the periodic motions of the system with total ( kinetic plus potential ) energy slightly smaller than zero .    in the ( n)boundary condition case single interface and periodic profiles",
    "are proven to be unstable @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite , where it is shown that , in presence of a global constraint , the periodic profiles are not even local minimizers of the landau functional defining the model , or in other words the corresponding second variation of the landau functional is strictly negative at some perturbation of them .",
    "we then expect that any time dependent solution of the allen  cahn evolution equation , for any choice of the initial profile , will never tend in the long time limit to one of these oscillating stationary solutions .",
    "in other words , the standard allen  cahn evolution can not create an alternating profile and , indeed , such an equation is used to model domain coarse  graining in phase separation .",
    "the question we pose in this paper is the following : in presence of compactons , can the allen  cahn evolution describe the alternating profile formation ? in this paper , by means of a numerical computation in the framework of a specific model , we shall give a positive answer to such a question .",
    "in particular we shall show that the alternating compacton profile formation is possible with both ( d ) and ( n)boundary conditions .    in our study we shall use the following techniques : the stationary solution of the allen  cahn equation",
    "will be studied analytically and the `` usual '' qualitative weierstrass study will allow the construction of the phase portrait which will provide a thorough description of the structure of the stationary profiles . on the other hand , the time ",
    "dependent solutions will be studied numerically and a code based on the finite element method will be adopted .    in order to perform the numerical study a particular choice of the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be done .",
    "we borrow those functions from @xcite where a model describing the gas  liquid interface in a capillary tube has been proposed .",
    "it is worth noting that we shall not discuss the evolution equations proposed in @xcite , but the allen  cahn equation with stationary profiles coinciding with the ones in the @xcite model .",
    "indeed , our main interest is that of understanding the allen  cahn evolution in presence of compactons and to this aim we have chosen , as a prototype model , the one in @xcite whose stationary solutions has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "moreover , this model allows to study analytically the compactons , whose behavior can be expressed in terms of special functions .",
    "this will provide us with an effective analytical control of our numerical results .",
    "one of the main results in @xcite is the possibility to describe the existence of local , non  spreading , and compactly supported bubbles in a capillary tube . in that paper",
    "the model was studied numerically . here",
    "we solve analytically the equation giving the stationary states of the system and explain some of the features of the compacton solutions presented in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : compattoni ] we discuss under quite general hypotheses the existence of compactons for the stationary allen  cahn equations . in section  [ s : modello ]",
    "we consider the model introduced in @xcite to study the gas  liquid interface in capillary tube and , in such a context , we find explicitly ( in terms of special function ) the compacton solutions and discuss their main physical properties . in section  [ s : dinamica ]",
    "we study numerically the solutions of the allen  cahn equation with higher  order stiffness @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 as in @xcite .",
    "section  [ s : conclusioni ] is devoted to some brief conclusions .",
    "we consider the allen  cahn problem on the one  dimensional space @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the equation for the stationary solutions @xmath29 then becomes @xmath30 here , and in the following , the prime will always denote the derivative with respect to the natural argument , whereas space ( time ) derivatives will be written explicitly as @xmath31 or with a subscript @xmath32 ( @xmath33 or with a subscript @xmath34 ) .",

    "the choice of the potential energy @xmath11 with two isoenergetic minima models the existence of two coexisting phases .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath10 tends to @xmath4 in @xmath4 and @xmath5 at least as a power law , namely , there exists @xmath40 such that @xmath41 the two last assumptions are crucial for the compacton existence for simplicity",
    ". the same discussion can be repeated for very general double well potential energies , but the condition on the higher  order stiffness coefficient have to be chosen accordingly . ] , see and the discussion which follows , as well as the related arguments in @xcite .",
    "it is very important to remark that any regular solution @xmath42 of is such that the conservation law @xmath43 = 0\\ ] ] is satisfied .",
    "note that the problem is similar , see also @xcite , to that of an holonomic conservative mechanical system with lagrangian coordinate @xmath6 , not constant mass matrix @xmath26 , and potential energy of the conservative force @xmath44 , once the space variable @xmath32 is interpreted as time .",
    "a lot of care has to be used when one wants to exploit this analogy , since the mass matrix @xmath26 is not positive defined , but it is equal to zero in the pure phases @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the aim of this model is that of describing a compact interface ( or connection ) between the pure phases @xmath45 and @xmath46 , namely , we look for a solution of equal to zero on a finite ( say left ) space interval , equal to one on a finite ( say right ) space interval , and continuously joining these two pure phases on an intermediate  finite \" space interval .",
    "this intermediate interval will be the compact interface ( or connection ) between the two pure phases .    in standard cases , i.e. , when the higher ",
    "order stiffness coefficient is constant , an interface with zero derivative at the boundary can only be achieved on an infinite space interval ( heteroclinic problem ) .",
    "this property is very general and is connected to the uniqueness of the solution of a cauchy problem which is ensured if the differential equation describing the interface is sufficiently regular . in the model we are studying here ,",
    "this regularity of the equation is not satisfied due to the presence of the not positive definite mass matrix @xmath26 .",
    "this is the key peculiarity of the model that gives rise to the existence of compacton solutions .",
    "first of all we note that the constant functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 trivially satisfy .",
    "so that we can imagine to construct a solution of this equation such that @xmath47 for all @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath48 for all @xmath50 $ ] , with @xmath51 given .",
    "the problem , now , is that of finding the interface joining the two pure phases on the  finite \" interval @xmath52 $ ] . note that the pure phases fix the value of the constant of motion to zero",

    "we close this section by noting that , by means of the conservation law , it is possible to describe the structure of all the solutions of the stationary equation .",
    "indeed , ensures that any regular solution satisfies the equation @xmath57 for some @xmath58 .",
    "the structure of the solution of the equation lying in the interval @xmath59 is as follows .",
    "for @xmath60 the constant , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , solutions and combination of them with compactons are found .",
    "note that , since we assumed a power law behavior of @xmath26 for @xmath61 , we have that the space derivative of the profile can be zero , finite , or divergent in the phases @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for @xmath62 , since @xmath26 vanishes in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the profile @xmath42 must have divergent derivative in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
