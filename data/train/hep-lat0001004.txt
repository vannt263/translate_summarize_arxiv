    "the advantage of using improved actions has been recognized in many area of lattice simulations ; at the same time the merits of using anisotropic lattice have been well understood@xcite .",
    "then we had started the study of the anisotropic properties for the improved actions@xcite .",
    "the improved actions we study in this work consist of terms @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent plaquette and 6-link rectangular loops respectively , and @xmath12 and @xmath4 satisfies @xmath13 .",
    "our improved action covers + i ) tree level symanzik s action(@xmath14)@xcite , + ii ) iwasaki s action(@xmath15)@xcite , + iii ) qcdtaro s action(@xmath16)@xcite + etc .",
    "+ for these classes of improved actions the anisotropic lattice is formulated in the same way as in the case of standard plaquette action@xcite .",
    "we introduce the coupling constant , @xmath17 , ( @xmath18 ) and lattice spacing , @xmath19 , ( @xmath20 ) in space ( temperature ) direction . with these parameters ,",
    "the action on the anisotropic lattice is written as , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . + in the weak coupling expansions",
    ", the @xmath2 parameter has been written as follows , @xmath25 the behavior of @xmath26 had already been reported at lat98@xcite , which we will show in fig.1 .",
    "we have found that @xmath26 changes sign around @xmath27 .",
    "namely in the weak coupling region , for the iwasaki s and qcdtaro s actions , the @xmath2 parameter is less than unity contrary to the case of the standard plaquette action .",
    "+ the natural question is what is the behavior of @xmath2 in the intermediate to weak coupling region , for those improved actions .",
    "numerically , the parameter @xmath2 is calculated by the relation @xmath28@xcite@xcite@xcite , where @xmath29 is a bare anisotropy parameter which appears in the action , @xmath30 while the renormalized anisotropy parameter is defined by @xmath31 . for the probe of the scale for the space and temperature direction",
    ", we use the lattice potential in these directions .",
    "the lattice potential in temperature direction is defined by wilson loops in space - temperature plane , @xmath32 the potential in the space direction is defined in a similar way .",
    "+ the simulations are mainly done on the @xmath33 lattice for @xmath34 , and for some @xmath3 on @xmath35 lattice to study the size dependences . +",
    "the method of determination of @xmath2 is explained in some detail by the examples of @xmath36 for iwasaki s improved action .",
    "+ we fix @xmath37 , and calculate the rate @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "the results for @xmath40 are shown in the fig.2 for each @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "for these @xmath43 we have made the interpolation by the second order polynomial in @xmath29 and solve the point where @xmath44 is satisfied .",
    "then the @xmath2 is obtained for each @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the results for the @xmath2 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "it is found that for @xmath45 , @xmath2 is almost flat . for the flat region ,",
    "we take the average of them .",
    "the errors are estimated by the jackknife method .",
    "the same analysis has been repeated for other @xmath3 and for the other improved actions . + in order to check the size dependences , the simulations are carried out on @xmath46 lattice at @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the iwasaki s improved action .",
    "it is found that at @xmath47 the size dependence is not small but at @xmath49 it is quite small .",
    "therefore for the intermediate to strong coupling region , the simulation is carried out on @xmath50 lattice .",
    "all the results are summarized in fig.4 .",
    "@xmath51 iwasaki s action + the @xmath2 parameter has a shallow dip at @xmath52 and then blows up towards the small @xmath3 region .",
    "the prediction by the one loop perturbative calculation breaks down qualitatively . as a results of this behavior the @xmath53 in the wide range of @xmath3 .",
    "+ the results for @xmath54 are also shown in the fig.4 .",
    "it is found that the qualitative behavior is the same but the dip around @xmath55 becomes deeper .",
    "this means that the renormalization of the anisotropy parameter is larger for larger @xmath56 .",
    "+ @xmath51 tree - level symanzik s action and the action with @xmath57 + the @xmath2 for symanzik s action is qualitatively the same as those of the standard action@xcite ; namely it increases monotonically as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "but the slope is less steep and then the value of @xmath2 is smaller than the standard action at a given @xmath3 .",
    "+ for the action with @xmath57 , it has been found that @xmath58 , namely the renormalization of the anisotropy parameter is zero in the weak coupling perturbative calculations@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 in the intermediate to strong coupling region shows similar behavior with the standard plaquette action and symanzik s action .",
    "but again the slope becomes less steep .",
    "+ @xmath51 global features of @xmath59 + the calculation with the qcdtaro s action is not carried out yet .",
    "but we have found the global structure of the @xmath2 parameter as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the interesting point is that the for the action with @xmath60 , the @xmath2 once decreases and then increases with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "as a result of this behavior the @xmath2 stays close to one in the wide range of @xmath3 for iwasaki s improved action .",
    "this may be a good features for the numerical simulations . + @xmath51 further works + the calculation of the @xmath2 at stronger coupling region and the other @xmath61 etc are now under study .",
    "we are preparing to use the smeared wilson loops for the simulation in the stronger coupling region .",
    "+ we are starting the calculation of the lattice spacing @xmath62 as a function of @xmath3 on the anisotropic lattices .",
    "+ the behavior of @xmath2 with smaller @xmath4 like qcdtaro s action , is also an interesting problem .",
    "+ we are preparing the simulations of physical quantities on an anisotropic lattice with improved actions .",
    "the targets are heavy quark spectroscopy , transport coefficients of quark gluon plasma etc .",
