    "the _ proton charge radius puzzle _ @xcite , is yet to meet its fully agreeable solution .",
    "one way to solve it is to find an effect that would raise the @xmath4 lamb shift by about 310 @xmath3ev , and it has been suggested that proton structure could produce such an effect at @xmath5 , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "most of the studies , however , derive an order of magnitude smaller effect of proton structure beyond the charge radius  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 effects of proton structure in the lamb shift are usually divided into the effect of ( i ) the @xmath6 zemach moment , ( ii ) finite - size recoil , and ( iii ) polarizabilities .",

    "some of the effects were already assessed in the heavy - baryon variant of the theory ( hb@xmath9pt ) , namely : nevado and pineda  @xcite computed the polarizability effect to leading order ( lo ) [ i.e. , @xmath11 $ ] , while birse and mcgovern  @xcite computed the ` subtraction ' term in @xmath12 hb@xmath9pt ( with the caveat explained in the end of sec .",

    "thus , the lo effect of the pion cloud is paramagnetic in one case and diamagnetic in the other ( see @xcite for more on hb@xmath9pt vs.  b@xmath9pt ) . due to these qualitative and quantitative differences it is interesting to examine the b@xmath9pt predictions for the 2@xmath7 contributions to the lamb shift .",

[ eq : t2born ]    in our calculation the born part was separated by subtracting the on - shell @xmath59 pion loop vertex in the one - particle - reducible vvcs graphs , see diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",

    "( [ eq : einelexact ] ) .",
    "this comparison shows that the lex is applicable in this case , i.e. : in the energy - shift formula of the @xmath52-dependence of the numerator can to an extremely good approximation be neglected . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : hblimit ] , this approximation works well in the case of hb@xmath9pt calculation too .    to estimate the uncertainty of the lo result",

    "given the shape of the weighting function plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : weighting ] , the main contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumruleestruc ] ) comes from low @xmath53 s , and therefore @xmath73 cancels out .",
    "the dominant polarizability effect in the lamb shift thus comes from the electric polarizability @xmath71 .",
    "the b@xmath9pt physics of @xmath71 is such that to obtain the empirical number of about 11 ( in units of 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) , 7 comes from lo ( @xmath74 loops ) and 4 from nlo ( @xmath75 loops ) , with uncertainty of about @xmath76 from the @xmath12 low - energy constant  @xcite . since in the present calculation",
    "we include only the lo @xmath74 loops , we expect our value to increase in magnitude when going to the next order ( i.e. , including the @xmath75 loops ) .",
    "as the result , we replace the usual uncertainty of 15% ( @xmath77gev ) due to the higher - order effects by an uncertainty of 30% [ @xmath78gev ] toward the magnitude increase , anticipating in this way the effect of the @xmath79 loops .",
    "the 15% uncertainty remains toward the magnitude decrease . with thus defined uncertainty ,",
    "our result is : @xmath80 this is the number given in the third row of the last column in table  [ table : summary ] , where it can be compared to some previous results .",
    "most of them agree on the polarizability contribution . as for the ` inelastic ' and ` subtraction ' contributions",
    ", their meaningful comparison can only be made together with discussing the role of the @xmath81(1232)-resonance excitation .",
    "presently the most common approach to calculate the polarizability effect relies on obtaining the vvcs amplitude from the sum rules of .",
    "unfortunately , even a perfect knowledge of the inclusive cross sections ( or , equivalently , the unpolarized structure functions ) determines the vvcs amplitude only up to the subtraction function @xmath82 .",
    "the total result is therefore divided into the ` inelastic ' part which is determined by empirical cross sections , and the ` subtraction ' terms which stands for the contribution of the subtraction function .",
    "we can also perform such a division and based on the low - energy version of the sum rules [ i.e. , ] obtain :    [ eq : decomposedls ] @xmath83    this looks very different from the dispersive calculation , cf .",
    "table  [ table : summary ] .",
    "the main reason for this is the @xmath10-resonance excitation mechanism shown by the graph in .",
    "we have checked that the dominant , magnetic - dipole ( @xmath84 ) , part of electromagnetic nucleon - to-@xmath81 transition is strongly suppressed here , as is the entire magnetic polarizability ( @xmath72 ) contributions , cf .",
    "discussion below eq .  .",
    "it is not suppressed in the ` inelastic ' and ` subtraction ' contributions separately , but cancels out only in the total .",
    "thus , even though it is well justified to neglect the graph in at the current level of precision , the split into ` inelastic ' and ` subtraction ' looks unfair without it .    in most of the dispersive calculations the cancelation of the @xmath81 excitation , as well as of the entire contribution of @xmath72 ,",
    "occurs too , because the subtraction function is at low @xmath53 expressed though the empirical value for @xmath72 .",
    "even the hb@xmath9pt - inspired calculation of the subtraction function  @xcite , which does not include the @xmath81(1232 ) explicitly , is not an exception , as a low - energy constant from @xmath12 is chosen to achieve the empirical value for @xmath72 .",
    "and even at @xmath23 hb@xmath9pt , the chiral - loop contribution to @xmath72 is  somewhat counterintuitively  paramagnetic and not too far from the empirical value , leading to a reasonable result for the ` subtraction ' contribution .",
    "we take a closer look at the hb@xmath9pt prediction for the various lamb - shift contributions in the following section .    the central value for the ` subtraction ' contribution obtained by gorchtein  et al .",
    "@xcite is negative , even though the @xmath81-excitation is included in their ` inelastic ' piece .",
    "the quoted uncertainty of their subtraction value , however , is too large to point out any contradiction of this result with the other studies .",
    "the heavy - baryon expansion , or hb@xmath9pt",
    "@xcite , was called to salvage  consistent power counting \" which seemed to be lost in b@xmath9pt , i.e.  the straightforward , manifestly lorentz - invariant formulation of @xmath9pt in the baryon sector  @xcite . however , as first pointed out by gegelia et al .",
    "@xcite , the  power - counting violating terms \" are renormalisation scheme dependent and as such do not alter physical quantities .",
    "furthermore , in hb@xmath9pt they are absent only in dimensional regularisation .",
    "if a cutoff regularization is used the terms which superficially violate power counting arise in hb@xmath9pt as well , and must be handled in the same way as they are handled nowadays in b@xmath9pt  by renormalization .    in this work for example , all such ( superficially power - counting violating ) terms ,",
    "together with ultraviolet divergencies , are removed in the course of renormalization of the proton field , charge , anomalous magnetic moment , and mass .",
    "we use the physical values for these parameters and hence the on - mass - shell ( oms ) scheme .",
    "this is different from the extended on - mass shell scheme ( eoms ) @xcite , where one starts with the parameters in the chiral limit .",
    "the physical observables , such as the lamb shift in this case , would of course come out exactly the same in both schemes , provided the parameters in the eoms calculation are chosen to yield the physical proton mass at the physical pion mass .",
    "coming back to hb@xmath9pt . despite the above - mentioned developments the hb@xmath9pt is still often in use .",
    "the two eft studies of proton structure corrections done until now @xcite are done in fact within hb@xmath9pt .",
    "we next examine these results from the b@xmath9pt perspective .",
    "one of the advantages of having worked out a b@xmath9pt result is that the one of hb@xmath9pt can easily be recovered .",
    "we do it by expanding the expressions of appendix  [ app : vvcs - amplitudes ] in @xmath85 , while keeping the ratio of light scales @xmath86 fixed .",
    "for the leading term the feynman - parameter integrations are elementary and we thus obtain the following heavy - baryon expressions :    t_1^()(0,q^2 ) & & m _ ( 1- ) , + t_2^()(0,q^2 ) & & - m _ ( 1 - ) .    the first expression reproduces the result of birse and mcgovern ( cf .",

    "we have also verified that these amplitudes correspond to the ones of nevado and pineda  @xcite at zero energy ( @xmath88 ) , up to a convention for an overall normalization of the amplitudes .    substituting these expressions into , we obtain the following value for the polarizability contribution to the @xmath8-level shift in @xmath3h : @xmath89 this is slightly different from the result of ref .  @xcite that we quote in , which is because of the neglected energy dependence , i.e. , the use of the lex in deriving from .",
    "still , the difference between the exact and lex result is well within the expected 15% uncertainty of such calculation and hence we conclude that the lex approximation works well in this case too .",
    "substitution to yields the hb@xmath9pt predictions for the ` inelastic ' and ` subtraction ' contributions :    [ eq : hbdecomposedls ] @xmath90    neglecting for a moment the difference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we obtain very simple closed expressions for the lamb shift contributions :    [ eq : simplehb ] e_2s^ ( ) ( ) & & ( 1- 10 g + 6 2 ) = -16.1 , + e_2s^ ( ) ( ) & & ( 1- 2 g + 2 2 ) = 1.1 , + e_2s^ ( ) ( ) & & ( 1- 18 g + 10 2 ) = -17.2 ,    where @xmath93 is the catalan s constant .",
    "this should provide an impression of the parametric dependencies arising in @xmath9pt for this effect .",
    "the resulting numbers are within the expected uncertainty for hb@xmath9pt result , and can in principle be easily improved in a perturbative treatment of the pion - muon mass difference .",
    "so far we have been discussing the @xmath23 result . at higher orders one in addition to the vvcs calculation",
    "needs to consider the appropriate operators from the effective lepton - nucleon lagrangian with corresponding low - energy constants fixed to , e.g. , the low - energy lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "birse and mcgovern  @xcite computed the vvcs amplitude @xmath94 to order @xmath12 , but evaded the consideration of the lepton - nucleon terms by introducing a  physical cutoff \" in @xmath53 .",
    "hence , their resulting calculation of the subtraction term is strongly cutoff dependent and lies , strictly speaking , outside the @xmath9pt framework ; we refer to it as  hb@xmath9pt - inspired \" calculation .",
    "although at high enough orders hb@xmath9pt and b@xmath9pt are bound to yield the same results , at low orders this is not necessarily so and practice shows that especially at ` predictive ' orders , where there is no free lecs to absorb the differences , hb@xmath9pt and b@xmath9pt results differ substantially , sometimes even in the sign of the total effect ( cf .",
    "the order @xmath95 result for the magnetic polarizability of the nucleon  @xcite ) .",
    "the proton polarizability contribution to the lamb shift is apparently such a case as well .",
    "so , having found the substantial differences between the hb@xmath9pt and b@xmath9pt predictions the obvious question is : which one is more reliable , if any ?",
    "a rather common point of view is that , since hb@xmath9pt neglects only the effects of  higher order \" , any substantial disagreement only signals the importance of higher - order effects and hence neither of the calculations should be trusted at this order . on the other hand , it is plausible that not all the higher - order effects are large , but only the ones present in the b@xmath9pt calculation and dismissed in the one of hb@xmath9pt . in support of the latter scenario",
    "is the physical principle of analyticity  consequence of ( micro-)causality , which in b@xmath9pt is obeyed exactly while in hb@xmath9pt is only approximate , albeit improvable order by order .",
    "another , perhaps more quantitative criterion is the one put forward by strikman and weiss  @xcite . in the interpretation of ref .",
    "@xcite , it requires that the high - momentum contribution of finite ( renormalized ) loop integrals over quantities which are invariant under redefinitions of hadron fields should not exceed the expected uncertainty of the given - order calculation . in other words , the contribution from beyond the scales at which the effective theory is applicable should not exceed a natural estimate of missing higher - order effects .    in our case",
    "the vvcs amplitudes are such quantities invariant under redefinitions of pion and nucleon fields and hence it makes sense to examine , where the polarizability effect is plotted as function of an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath96 imposed on the momentum integration in .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the relative size of the high - momentum contribution in the hb@xmath9pt case is substantially larger than in b@xmath9pt .    assuming the breakdown scale for @xmath9pt is of order of the @xmath97-meson mass , @xmath98  mev",
    ", we can make a more quantitative statement . in the present hb@xmath9pt calculation",
    "the contribution from @xmath99 is least 25% of the total result , hence exceeding the natural expectation of uncertainty of such calculations . in the b@xmath9pt case ,",
    "the contribution from momenta above @xmath100 is less than 15% , well within the expected uncertainty .",
    "is the proton polarizability effect different in muonic versus electronic hydrogen such as to affect the charge radius extraction ?",
    "the answer is ` yes ' . from the lex formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumruleestruc ] ) , one sees that the polarizability contribution not only affects the charge radius extraction from the lamb shift but also that this effect is about @xmath101 times stronger in @xmath3h than in @xmath102h . indeed , the weighting function plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : weighting ] for the two cases is much larger in the muon case .",
    "the lepton mass acts , in fact , as a cutoff scale .",
    "nonetheless , the b@xmath9pt result obtained hereby demonstrates that the magnitude of this effect is not nearly enough to explain the ` proton radius puzzle ' , which amounts to a discrepancy of about 300 @xmath3ev .",
    "as seen from  table  [ table : summary ] , our b@xmath9pt result for the polarizability effect agrees with the previous evaluations based on dispersive sum rules , but is substantially smaller in magnitude than the hb@xmath9pt result of nevado and pineda  @xcite .",
    "this is of course not the first case when the b@xmath9pt and hb@xmath9pt results differ significantly  the polarizabilities themselves provide such an example .",

    "@xcite that the split between the ` elastic ' and ` inelastic ' 2@xmath103 contributions corresponds unambiguously to the split between the born and non - born parts of the vvcs amplitude , rather than between the pole and non - pole parts .",
    "we have observed that the @xmath10-excitation mechanism shown in does not impact the lamb shift in a significant way because the dominant magnetic - dipole ( @xmath84 ) transition is suppressed , as is the entire magnetic polarizability effect .",
    "the @xmath10-excitation effect is however important for the dispersive calculation because it is prominent in the proton structure functions and hence must be included in the ` subtraction ' contribution to achieve a consistent cancelation of the @xmath84 @xmath10 excitation . in most of the models",

    "@xcite [ i.e. , @xmath105 @xmath3ev ] , our result for the full @xmath106 contribution to the @xmath107@xmath108 lamb shift is in nearly prefect agreement with the presently favored value @xcite of @xmath109 @xmath3ev .    while the leading - order @xmath9pt calculation gives a reliable prediction for the polarizability contribution , the splitting of it into ` inelastic ' and ` subtraction ' works less well , because of the missing @xmath110(1232)-excitation effect , which will only enter at the ( future ) next - to - leading order calculation .",
