    "this measurement is a useful check of the models for soft rescattering @xcite . a good way to study the low impact parameter ( @xmath16 ) region is to observe @xmath4 boson production via @xmath17 fusion ,",

    "both gaps originate from @xmath3-exchange , and the corresponding @xmath16 region is similar to that for exclusive higgs production .",

    "the distribution @xmath7 can be obtained from the conventional gluon distribution , @xmath23 , known from the global parton analyses .",
    "the main uncertainty here comes from the lack of knowledge of the integrated gluon distribution @xmath24 at low @xmath25 and small scales .",
    "for example , taking @xmath26 we find @xcite @xmath27 . these are big uncertainties bearing in mind that the cep cross section depends on @xmath28 .",

    "the search for the exclusive dijets at the tevatron , @xmath31 , is performed @xcite by plotting the cross section in terms of the variable @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the mass of the whole central system . however , the @xmath34 distribution is smeared out by qcd radiation , hadronization , the jet algorithm and other experimental effects @xcite . to weaken the smearing it was proposed in ref .",

    "the cross section @xmath41 , as a function of @xmath42 , for the production of a pair of high @xmath37 dijets accompanied by a third jet is discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the measurements of the exclusive two- and three - jet cross sections _ as a function of @xmath37 _ of the highest jet allow a detailed check of the sudakov physics ; with much more information coming from the @xmath40 dependence study . a clear way to observe the sudakov suppression",
    "is just to measure the @xmath37 dependence of exclusive dijet production . on dimensional grounds we would expect @xmath43 .",
    "this behaviour is modified by the gluon anomalous dimension and by a stronger sudakov suppression with increasing @xmath37 .",
    "already the existing cdf dijet data @xcite exclude predictions which omit the sudakov effect .",

    "@xcite . a typical diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig : enh](c ) . for lhc energies it was found that such effect may be numerically large .",
    "the reason is that the gluon density grows at low @xmath25 and , for low @xmath45 partons , approaches the saturation limit .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the enhanced diagram should affect mainly the very beginning of the qcd evolution ",
    "the region that can not be described perturbatively and which , in @xcite , is already included phenomenologically .",

    "that is r  =  =   s^2s^2_en_over  b_t , [ eq : ren ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the parton densities determined from the global analyses of inclusive and diffractive dis data , respectively .",
    "we can measure a double distribution @xmath49 , and form the ratio @xmath46 using the inclusive cross section , @xmath50 .",

    "we expect @xmath55 0.25 , 0.4 and 0.8 at @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the addition of forward proton detectors to lhc experiments will add unique capabilities to the existing lhc experimental programme . for certain bsm scenarios ,",

    "there is also a rich qcd , electroweak , and more exotic physics , menu .",
    "the uncertainties in the prediction of the cep processes are potentially not small .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to perform checks of the theoretical formalism using reactions that will be experimentally accessible in the first lhc runs @xcite .",
    "most of the measurements discussed above can be performed , without detecting the protons , by taking advantage of the relatively low luminosity in the early lhc runs .",
    "when the forward proton detectors are operating much more can be done .",
    "first , it is possible to measure directly the cross section @xmath58 for single diffractive dissociation and also the cross section @xmath59 for soft central diffractive production .",
    "these measurements will strongly constrain the models used to describe diffractive processes and the effects of soft rescattering .",
