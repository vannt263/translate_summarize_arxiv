    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a promising extension of the standard model of particle physics ( sm )  @xcite . at the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    "@xcite , the masses , decay widths , couplings , and spins of the new susy particles can be measured with high precision  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the lightest states like pairs of neutralinos , charginos , and sleptons , can be studied in the initial stage of the ilc , with a center - of - mass energy @xmath3  gev , and a luminosity of @xmath4  fb@xmath5 .",
    "the lightest susy state is a pair of radiatively produced neutralinos  @xcite @xmath6 the signal is a single high energetic photon , radiated off the incoming beams or off the exchanged selectrons , and missing energy , carried by the neutralinos  @xcite .",
    "the main standard model background is photons from radiatively produced neutrinos @xmath1  @xcite . in order to quantify whether an excess of signal photons from radiative neutralino production , @xmath7 , can be observed over the sm background photons , @xmath8",
    ", we define the theoretical significance @xmath9 , and the signal to background ratio @xmath10  @xcite @xmath11 for example , a theoretical significance of @xmath12 implies that the signal can be measured at the statistical 68% confidence level . if the experimental error of the background cross section is 1% , the signal to background ratio must be larger than 1% .",
    "a detection of the signal requires at least @xmath13",
    "for the tree - level calculation of the cross sections @xmath14 for signal and background , we use the formulas for the amplitudes squared as given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to regularize the infrared and collinear divergences , we apply cuts on the photon scattering angle @xmath15 and energy @xmath16",
    "@xcite @xmath17 the upper cut on the photon energy @xmath18 is the kinematical limit of radiative neutralino production .",
    "this cut also reduces much of the on - shell @xmath19 boson contribution to the background from radiative neutrino production  @xcite .",
    "note that the ratios @xmath10 and @xmath9 do not depend very sensitively on the choice of the cuts @xmath20 and @xmath21 , since signal and background have very similar distributions in energy @xmath16 and angle @xmath15 .",
    "we present numerical results of the signal and background cross sections with emphasis on their dependence on the beam polarization  @xcite , and on the higgsino and gaugino mass parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "finally we discuss a msugra scenario , where radiative production of neutralinos is the only accessible susy state at @xmath2  gev .              in fig .",

    "@xcite , the neutralino is mostly bino , such that radiative neutralino production dominantly proceeds via right selectron @xmath28 exchange .",
    "the background , radiative neutrino production , mainly proceeds via @xmath29 boson exchange .",
    "thus positive electron beam polarization @xmath30 and negative positron beam polarization @xmath31 enhance the signal cross section and reduce the background at the same time , such that the significance is greatly enhanced , see fig .",

    "[ fig : beampol ] , we show contour lines of the signal @xmath27 and background cross section @xmath26 in the @xmath22@xmath23 plane .",
    "the signal is decreasing for increasing @xmath23 , since the neutralino mass @xmath37 and the selectron mass @xmath38 are increasing . for decreasing values of @xmath39  gev ,",
    "the bino component of the neutralino is decreasing , leading to a decreasing signal cross section @xmath27 .",
    "note that the background cross section also depends on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , since the kinematical cuts include the neutralino mass , see eq .",

    "the radiative production of neutralinos is the only kinematically allowed susy state , which can however be observed with a significance of up to @xmath42 .",
