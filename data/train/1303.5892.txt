    "optical analogy has been of great importance to the development of quantum mechanics ; cf .",
    "quantum information processing has been one of the fields where authors have extensively studied classical analogies by use of linear optics elements involving classical light beams @xcite or single - photons @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the advent of technology that allows manufacturing arrays of optical waveguides has detonated the classical simulation of quantum and relativistic systems @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the classical simulation of a single two - level atom interacting with a quantized field , the basic building block in quantum optics , under nonlinear processes in the field and couplings as the linear interaction has already been classically simulated @xcite .",
    "the quantum model of interaction between an ensemble of two - level atoms and a radiation field under a series of approximations was introduced by dicke @xcite . the exact solution for the single atom case",
    "was found by jaynes and cummings @xcite and the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model became a work horse of quantum optics as well as the dicke model . among other interesting phenomena ,",
    "the jc model shows a collapse and revival of the mean atomic excitation energy when interacting with coherent radiation @xcite , but it has not been possible to describe it in closed form .",
    "buck and sukumar ( bs ) presented a jc model with nonlinear coupling where the mean atomic excitation energy can be evaluated in exact closed form and exhibits a periodic collapse and revival similar , for small times , to that seen in the jc model @xcite .",
    "the most general jc model involving nonlinear couplings , up to our knowledge , was presented and solved by kochetov @xcite , @xmath0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the kochetov model describes the interaction between a single atomic system , with a finite number of equidistant levels , and a single - mode radiation field .",
    "the atom is described by the generators @xmath1 with @xmath2 that obey an @xmath3 algebra , @xmath4 = \\pm \\hat{s}_{\\pm}$ ] and @xmath5 = 2 \\hat{s}_{z}$ ] , and the inter - level energy is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the field is described by the creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath7(@xmath8 ) , and the frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is a coupling constant and the function @xmath11 is a real well - behaved function of the number operator .",
    "peculiar phenomena has been found among the years with specific realizations of the kochetov model ; e.g. for just two levels @xcite .",
    "some other nonlinear models studied along the years for the two - level case involve : driving @xcite , field nonlinearities @xcite , or consider the coupling without the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite .",
    "the great majority of these models does not have a feasible experimental realization with current quantum technology .    in this contribution , we are interested in a specific class of the kochetov model that we extend to consider field nonlinearities and the counter rotating terms neglected by the rwa .",
    "we present our nonlinear rabi model and its characteristics in the following section ; in short , it conserves parity and this allows us to split the hilbert space in two parity basis .",
    "then , we show that these two parity basis allow us to describe the dynamics of our quantum model with classical light propagating in a set of two photonic lattices .",
    "we show how to construct typical initial states ; e.g. an initial state involving just a photon number state and the ground or excited state corresponds to light impinging just one waveguide and those involving coherent states can be prepared through glauber - fock photonic lattices @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the most common quantum optics measurements and show how they are related to measurements of the intensity at the end of the classical simulators , with just an exception that requires knowledge of the amplitude and phase at each output . in order to provide a working example",
    ", we present the bs model in section 4 and close with a brief conclusion .",
    "we are interested in a general nonlinear rabi model , @xmath12 with well - behaved real functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 in terms of the number operator , @xmath15 , and where the operators @xmath16 with @xmath2 are pauli matrices .",
    "we have split the nonlinear rabi coupling @xmath17 into jaynes - cummings coupling described by the coupling parameter @xmath18 and counter - rotating terms described by the parameter @xmath19 for reasons that will become apparent in the next section . as mentioned before , this general hamiltonian is not physical realizable with current experimental setups .",
    "for example , in order to implement ( [ eq : ourh ] ) in cavity- or circuit - qed the function @xmath13 must be linear to account for the free - field energy or quadratic at most to describe the effect of a kerr medium , @xmath20 , and the coupling function @xmath21 must be a constant .",
    "spin chains @xcite , ion traps @xcite , and atoms in optical lattices @xcite , just to mention a few examples , may provide a way to realize some of the hamiltonians covered by this class as far as one could attain precise control of the size , self - energies and couplings in the spin chain analog , drive an ion with multiple lasers in the second , and engineer adequate optical lattices in the latter .",
    "the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : ourh ] ) has constant of motion : parity , which can be defined as @xmath22 that is @xmath23=0 $ ] .",
    "conservation of parity allows us to define two orthogonal parity bases , @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "these parity bases split the hilbert space in two orthogonal parity subspaces which are the foundation for the classical simulation of our nonlinear rabi model .",
    "in addition , if the counter - rotating terms coupling parameter is null , @xmath26 , then the model reduces to a nonlinear jc model that also conserves the total number of excitations defined as @xmath27 ; i.e. @xmath28=0 $ ] .",
    "it is simple to obtain the time evolution for this case by using a method that makes use of susskind - glogower operators @xcite , @xmath29 , such that ( [ eq : ourh ] ) with @xmath26 becomes @xmath30 with the elements of the similarity transformation given by @xmath31 and the dispersion relation , @xmath32 photon transport is then given by the time evolution operator , @xmath33 in other words , by using the analogy between transport of single - photon states and propagation of classical field , it is very simple to calculate the propagation through the equivalent nonlinear jc photonic lattice via quantum optics methods .",
    "the dynamics of a hamiltonian system is given by the schrdinger equation @xmath34 where the notation @xmath35 stands for partial derivative with respect to @xmath36 . as our model hamiltonian ( [ eq : ourh ] ) conserves parity , we can split the evolution in even and odd parts , @xmath37 , and propose the solutions @xmath38 this parity decomposition leads to one coupled differential set for each of the parity subspaces : @xmath39 with @xmath40 each of these coupled differential sets is equivalent to that describing an array of waveguides coupled to their nearest neighbor up to a global phase and replacing @xmath41 . in this analogy ,",
    "the refraction index of the @xmath42th waveguide is modulated by @xmath43 and the separation distance between the @xmath42th and the preceding waveguide is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "we are interested in these one - dimensional photonic crystals due to the great control that can be attained in modulating both the refractive index of individual waveguides and the separation between them by femtosecond laser waveguide writing on fused silica @xcite . in recent experiments ,",
    "the precise control over the refractive index and coupling parameters of photonic lattices has allowed the classical simulation of the rabi model for coupling parameters of the order of the field frequency in small photonic lattices @xcite and , up to our knowledge , it is possible to inscribe as many as sixty waveguides in fused silica with parameters related to glauber - fock photonic lattices @xcite , which are of the order required by our nonlinear model , with a present technical limit set in the two hundred inscribed waveguides . on this account , caution must be exerted in finding the adequate balance between lattice size , parameters of the nonlinear rabi model , and initial state to be propagated .",
    "one of us has discussed somewhere else @xcite how a tight binding model of photonic lattices can be solved via matrix methods , @xmath45 leading to @xmath46 , as long as the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are time independent . in short , the dispersion relation of the truncated parity optical lattices of size @xmath47 are given by the roots of the characteristic polynomial @xmath48 described by the three - term recurrence relations : @xmath49 p_{0}^{(\\pm)}(\\lambda ) , \\\\",
    "p_{2k}^{(\\pm)}(\\lambda ) & = & \\left [ d^{(\\pm)}(2k-1 ) - \\lambda \\right ] p_{2k-1}^{(\\pm ) } - g_{\\pm}^{2 } f^{2k}(2k ) p_{2k-2 } , \\\\",
    "p_{2k+1}^{(\\pm)}(\\lambda ) & = & \\left [ d^{(\\pm)}(2k ) - \\lambda \\right ] p_{2k-1}^{(\\pm ) } - g_{\\mp}^{2 } f^{2k}(2k ) p_{2k-1 } , \\quad k \\ge 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the nonlinear jc case , @xmath50 , its truncation depends heavily on the initial state of the field thanks to the fact that the hamiltonian conserves the number of excitations . in the nonlinear rabi case",
    "the truncation depends heavily on both the initial state and the value of the coupling parameter @xmath19 , it increases rapidly with the value of @xmath19 . for experimental realizations",
    "this just means that the lattice must be large enough to keep the propagated classical field far from the last segment of waveguides",
    ".    typical measurements of interest in the quantum optics community include , the mean photon number , @xmath51 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is nothing else than the sum of the output intensity at each waveguide weighted by the waveguide position ; this quantity has been called the average center of mass of the propagating intensity in other context @xcite .",
    "another relevant quantity is the mean atomic excitation energy , @xmath52 + \\sum_{j=0}^{(n-1)/2 } \\left [ \\vert \\mathcal{e}^{(-)}_{2j}(t ) \\vert^{2 } - \\vert \\mathcal{e}^{(-)}_{2j + 1}(t ) \\vert^{2}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the addition of the intensity on the odd ( even ) waveguides minus the intensity on the even ( odd ) waveguides in the positive ( negative ) parity lattice .",
    "the atomic berry phase is other quantity of interest , @xmath53 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which clearly requires knowledge of the relative phases of the field at the outputs as it correlates the field amplitudes of positive and negative parity lattices .",
    "the fidelity of the time evolved state with respect to the initial state is another quantity of interest that requires knowledge of the relative phases of the amplitudes at the output of the parity lattices , @xmath54 finally , in order to recover information about the mixedness of the reduced atomic system , it is possible to calculate von neumann entropy , @xmath55 where the reduced atomic density matrix is given by @xmath56 where the time dependence has been obviated for the sake of space , @xmath57 .",
    "now , the most common initial state configurations in quantum optics involve number or coherent states .",
    "we can simulate a number state times an atomic superposition , @xmath58 that is , just one input port is used in each parity lattices . in the case of @xmath59 even the input at the positive and negative parity lattices are @xmath60 and @xmath61 with the phase @xmath62 given by the phase difference between @xmath63 and @xmath64 and the equivalent for @xmath59 odd . for coherent states ,",
    "say the simplest case , @xmath65 this state is simply obtained by impinging a field on the @xmath66th waveguide of a glauber - fock lattice @xcite and propagating it for the corresponding distance .",
    "then , the output at the even waveguides is sent to the even waveguides of the positive parity lattice and that of the odd waveguides to the odd waveguides of the negative parity lattice .",
    "a highly entangled state involving coherent states can easily be constructed by sending the output from the glauber - fock lattice to just the positive or negative parity lattice ; for example , if we consider just the positive lattice : @xmath67 where the even ( odd ) coherent state is defined by @xmath68 .",
    "the glauber - fock lattice can be used to simulate input corresponding to both coherent and displaced number states .     with @xmath69 under bs dynamics on resonance , @xmath70 , and coupling parameters @xmath71 , @xmath50 .",

    "in order to present a practical example , let us refer to the bs model , @xmath72 that describes the interaction of a two - level system with a field under intensity dependent coupling .",
    "it is related to our model hamiltonian ( [ eq : ourh ] ) by setting @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
