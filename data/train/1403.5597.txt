    "the purpose of this letter is to remark on the well cited research article @xcite , where the following tri - trophic population model originally proposed in @xcite is considered ,    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    this model is based on the leslie - gower formulation @xcite , and considers the interactions between a generalist top predator @xmath6 , specialist middle predator @xmath7 , and prey @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are solutions to the above system - .",
    "the model is very rich dynamically , and has led to a number of works in the literature @xcite . in @xcite various theorems on the boundedness of the system - are proved , and the existence of an invariant attracting set is established . in particular , we recall the following result ( theorem 3 ( 2i ) , ( 3i ) @xcite )    [ thm : aziz ] consider the model - . under the assumption that    @xmath10    all solutions to - are uniformly bounded forward in time , for any initial data in @xmath11 , and they eventually enter a bounded attracting set @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore system - is dissipative .",
    "note , @xmath12 is explicitly defined in @xcite .",
    "also condition is equation ( 7 ) in @xcite .",
    "the form of is different from equation ( 7 ) in @xcite , as in @xcite different constants have been used , than what we are currently using .",
    "however it is a matter of simple algebra to convert equation ( 7 ) from @xcite to our setting .",
    "our aim in the current letter is to show that ( theorem 3 ( 2i ) , ( 3i ) @xcite ) is incorrect . in particular",
    "we show ,    \\1 ) solutions to - are not bounded uniformly in time , even if condition from theorem [ thm : aziz ] is met .",
    "furthermore , solutions to - can even blow - up in finite time for large initial data .",
    "thus there is no absorbing set @xmath12 for all initial conditions in @xmath11 , and system - is not dissipative in @xmath13 , even under condition .",
    "\\2 ) similar results hold for the spatially explicit model .",
    "\\3 ) the above results can be validated numerically .",
    "we choose parameters satisfying , and show that numerical simulations of - , and its spatially extended form , still lead to finite time blow - up .",
    "we state the following theorem    [ thm : r1 ] consider the three species food chain model - . for",
    "@xmath14    @xmath15 blows up in finite time , that is    @xmath16    as long as the initial data @xmath17 are large enough .",
    "first set @xmath18 .",
    "consider the following modification to system - , with solution @xmath19 ,    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    recall that @xmath23 , the solution to , blows up in finite time , at @xmath24 , and we have an exact solution for @xmath23 , for @xmath25 , given by ,    @xmath26    however , using this exact solution for @xmath23 , one can find an exact solution to via separation of variables .",
    "thus    @xmath27    for @xmath25 .",
    "next for a given @xmath28 we choose @xmath29 s.t we can enforce    @xmath30    to hold @xmath31 s.t .",
    "@xmath32 $ ]",
    ". implies    @xmath33    ( here we assume @xmath34 , else it is an uninteresting case )    equivalently we have    @xmath35    this of course is always possible for @xmath36 large enough",
    ".    however , note that @xmath37 is a subsolution to .",
    "if @xmath38 , this is immediate as then @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 , then we can assume @xmath41 , where we select @xmath42 s.t @xmath43 , and then choose @xmath42 in place of @xmath44 in .",
    "also @xmath23 ( with @xmath45 in place of @xmath29 in ) is a subsolution to , as long as holds .",
    "thus via direct comparison , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "since implies @xmath48 , it is immediate that the solution @xmath6 to will also blow - up , via direct comparison with @xmath49 solving with @xmath45 in place of @xmath29 .",
    "see figure [ fig : ode ] , for a simple graphical representation of this idea .",
    "thus we have ascertained the blow - up of system - , via direct comparison to the modified system - .",
    "this proves the theorem .",
    "we next state the following theorem    [ thm : d1 ] the three species food chain model - , even under condition is not dissipative in all of @xmath11 .    via theorem",
    "[ thm : r1 ] , there exists initial data in @xmath11 , for which solutions blow - up in finite time , and thus do not enter any bounded attracting set @xmath12 .",
    "thus system - is not dissipative .",
    "the essential error made in the proof in @xcite is in equation @xmath50 in @xcite .",
    "the derived bound for @xmath7 is inserted in an estimate for the sum of @xmath51 and @xmath6 . although it is true that @xmath7 is bounded , and enters an attracting set eventually , _ there is some transition time _ before this happens .",
    "if @xmath52 is chosen arbitrarily large , then this transition time can be made arbitrarily long .",
    "the key is for @xmath53 chosen large enough , during this transition time , we can enforce @xmath54 , for as long as it takes @xmath55 to bow up . in this case",
    "@xmath6 will also blow - up in finite time , ( by comparison to @xmath55 ) , and hence never enter any bounded attracting set .",
    "we now consider the following spatially extended version of - @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 defined on @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 and where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the parameters in the problem as earlier , are positive constants .",
    "we can prescribe either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath63 is an open bounded domain in @xmath64 with smooth boundary @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the positive diffusion coefficients .    the initial data @xmath69are assumed to be nonnegative and uniformly bounded on @xmath63 .",
    "the nonnegativity of the solutions is preserved by application of classical results on invariant regions ( @xcite ) , since the reaction terms are quasi - positive , i.e.@xmath70 the usual norms in the spaces @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are respectively denoted by    @xmath74@xmath75    since the reaction terms are continuously differentiable on @xmath76 , then for any initial data in @xmath73 or @xmath77 , it is easy to check directly their lipschitz continuity on bounded subsets of the domain of a fractional power of the operator @xmath78 , where @xmath79 the three dimensional identity matrix , @xmath80 is the laplacian operator and @xmath81 denotes the transposition . under these assumptions ,",
    "the following local existence result is well known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ prop : ls ] the system - admits a unique , classical solution @xmath9 on @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath83 then @xmath84      here we will show that - , blows up in finite time .",
    "we will do this by looking back at the blow - up for @xmath6 in , and then using a standard comparison method .",
    "consider - , with initial conditions @xmath85 and @xmath86 strictly positive .    by integrating the third equation of the ode system ,",
    "we have@xmath87which gives@xmath88if we prove that the function : @xmath89 vanishes at a time @xmath90 and since @xmath91 , then the solution will blow - up in finite time .",
    "since the reaction terms are continuous functions , then the solutions are classical and continuous and@xmath92if @xmath93 is sufficiently large , then there exists @xmath94 such that@xmath95then@xmath96 t < \\frac{1}{r_{0}^{-}}-\\frac{c}{2}t,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{for all } t\\in ( 0,\\delta ) .\\]]if @xmath86 is sufficiently large , then we can find @xmath97 such that@xmath98 this entails    @xmath99    thus one has @xmath100 , but @xmath101 , andby application of the mean value theorem , we obtain the existence of some @xmath102 , @xmath103 , s.t @xmath104 .",
    "this implies the solution of - blows up in finite time , at @xmath105 , and by a standard comparison argument @xcite , the solution of the corresponding pde system - , also blows up in finite time .",
    "we can thus state the following theorem    [ thm : tp1 ] consider the spatially explicit three species food chain model - . for @xmath106 , @xmath6 blows up in finite time , that is    @xmath107    as long as the initial data @xmath17 are large enough . here",
    "@xmath108 .",
    "note the above argument easily generalises to the case @xmath109 , where    @xmath110    thus one can also state the following corollary    [ cor : c2 ] consider the three species food chain model - .",
    "even if    @xmath111    solutions to - with certain initial data are not bounded forward in time .",
    "in fact the solution @xmath6 to can blow - up in finite time , that is    @xmath112    as long as the initial data @xmath17 are large enough . here",
    "@xmath113 .",
    "we remark that the methods of this section can be directly applied to prove blow up in the ode case as well .",
    "however the earlier proof via theorem [ thm : r1 ] has the advantage , that we can explicitly give a sufficient condition on the largeness of the data , required for blow - up .",
    "also , not just the @xmath114 norm , but every @xmath115 norm , @xmath116 , blows up .",
    "this is easily seen in analogy with the equation @xmath117 , and an application of the first eigenvalue method .",
    "also note the blow - up times @xmath118 for the pde case are not to be confused with the blow - up times @xmath118 for the ode case .",
    "in this section we numerically simulate the ode system - , as well as the pde system - , ( in 1d and 2d ) , in order to validate our results theorem [ thm : r1 ] , theorem [ thm : d1 ] , theorem [ thm : tp1 ] and corollary [ cor : c2 ] . to this end",
    "we select the following parameter range ,    @xmath119    these parameters satisfy condition , from @xcite .",
    "@xmath120    despite this , we see finite time blow - up . the systems are simulated in matlb r2011a . for simulation of the ode systems",
    "we have used the standard @xmath121 routine which uses a variable time step runge kutta method . to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of the pde system in one and two dimensional spatial domain ,",
    "the system of partial differential equations is numerically solved using a finite difference method .",
    "a central difference scheme is used for the one dimensional diffusion term , whereas standard five point explicit finite difference scheme is used for the two dimensional diffusion terms .",
    "the system is studied with positive initial condition and neumann boundary condition in the spatial domain @xmath122 , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 .",
    "note , our proof of blow - up , allows for dirichlet , neumann or robin type boundary conditions .",
    "simulations are done over this square domain with spatial resolution @xmath125 , and time step size @xmath126 .",
    "we next present the results of our simulations .",
    "in the current letter we have shown that the solutions to the system - , modeling a tri - trophic food chain can exhibit finite time blow - up under the condition from theorem [ thm : aziz ] , as long as the initial data is large enough .",
    "this is also true in the case of the spatially explicit model .",
    "thus the basin of attraction of the invariant set @xmath12 , explicitly constructed in @xcite , _ is not all of _ @xmath13 , as claimed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore system - _ is not dissipative _ in all of @xmath13 , also as claimed in @xcite . for a numerical valiadation of these results",
    "please see figures [ fig : ode ] , [ fig : pde1 ] , [ fig : pde2 ] .",
    "however , the model posesses very rich dynamics , in the parameter region    @xmath127    thus an extremely interesting open question is , what is the basin of attraction for an appropriately defined and constructed @xmath12 ? this is tantamount to asking , which sorts of initial data lead to globally existing solutions , under the dynamics of - , and the parameter range ? the same questions can be asked , in the case of the spatially explicit model .",
