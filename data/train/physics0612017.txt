    "in the last years , the literature on networks has been characterized by exponential growth .",
    "empirical and theoretical contributions in very diverse fields such as physics , sociology , economics , etc . have increasingly highlighted the pervasiveness of networked structures .",
    "examples range from www , the internet , airline connections , scientific collaborations and citations , trade and labor market contacts , friendship and other social relationships , business relations and r&s partnerships , all the way through cellular , ecological and neural networks @xcite .",
    "the empirical research has thoroughly studied the ( often complex ) topological properties of such networks , whereas a large number of theoretical models has been proposed in order to investigate how networks evolve through time @xcite .",
    "structural properties of networks have been shown to heavily impact on the dynamics of the socio - economic systems that they embed @xcite . as a result ,",
    "their understanding has become crucial also as far as policy implications are concerned @xcite .",
    "the simplest mathematical description of a network is in terms of a graph , that is a list of nodes @xmath0 and a set of arrows ( links ) , possibly connecting any two nodes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can characterize a network through a @xmath1 real - valued matrix @xmath2 , where any out - of - diagonal entry @xmath3 is non - zero if and only if an arrow from node @xmath4 to @xmath5 exists in the network .",
    "entries on the main diagonal are typically assumed to be all different from zero ( if self - interactions are allowed ) or all equal to zero ( if they are not ) .",
    "networks are distinguished in binary ( dichotomous ) or weighted . in binary networks",
    "all links carry the same intensity .",
    "this means that in binary networks a link is either present or not , i.e. @xmath6 . in this case , @xmath7 is called an `` adjacency '' matrix .",
    "weighted networks allow one instead to associate a weight ( i.e. a positive real number ) to each link , typically proportional to its interaction strength or the flux intensity it carries @xcite .",
    "any non - zero entry @xmath3 thus measures the weight of the link originating from @xmath4 and ending up in @xmath5 , and the resulting matrix @xmath7 is called the `` weights '' matrix.$ ] , all @xmath8 ( the more general case @xmath9 can be reduced to the former simply by dividing all weights by their maximum level in @xmath7 ) . ]",
    "both binary and weighted networks can be undirected or directed .",
    "formally , a network is undirected if all links are bilateral , i.e. @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "this means that in undirected networks all pairs of connected nodes mutually affect each other .",
    "one can thus replace arrows with non - directed edges ( or arcs ) connecting any two nodes and forget about the implicit directions .",
    "this greatly simplifies the analysis , as the tools for studying undirected networks are much better developed and understood .",
    "directed networks are instead not symmetric , as there exists at least a pair of connected nodes wherein one directed link is not reciprocated , i.e. @xmath12 , but @xmath13 .",
    "studying the topological properties of directed networks , especially in the weighted case , can become more difficult , as one has to distinguish inward from outward links in computing synthetic indices such as node and average nearest - neighbor degree and strength , clustering coefficient , etc .. therefore , it is not surprising that the properties of such indices are much less explored in the literature .    from a theoretic perspective , it is easy to distinguish undirected from directed networks : the network is undirected if and only if the matrix @xmath7 is symmetric .",
    "when it comes to the empirics , however , researchers often face the following problem . if the empirical network concerns an intrinsically mutual social or economic relationship ( e.g. friendship , marriage , business partnerships , etc . ) then @xmath7 , as estimated by the data collected , is straightforwardly symmetric and only tools designed for undirected network analysis are to be employed .",
    "more generally , however , one deals with notionally non - mutual relationships , possibly entailing directed networks . in that case",
    ", data usually allow to build a matrix @xmath7 that , especially in the weighted case , is hardly found to be symmetric .",
    "strictly speaking , one should treat all such networks as directed .",
    "this often implies a more complicated and convoluted analysis and , frequently , less clear - cut results .",
    "the alternative , typically employed by practitioners in the field , is to compute the ratio of the number of directed ( bilateral ) links actually present in the networks to the maximum number of possible directed links ( i.e. @xmath14 ) .",
    "if this ratio is `` reasonably '' large , then one can symmetrize the network ( i.e. making it undirected , see @xcite ) and apply the relevant undirected network toolbox .    however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this procedure has several drawbacks .",
    "in particular , it is heavily dependent on the density of the network under analysis ( i.e. , the ratio between the total number of existing links to @xmath14 ) .",
    "moreover , and most important here , if the network is weighted , the ratio of bilateral links does not take into account the effect of link weights .",
    "indeed , a bilateral link exists between @xmath4 and @xmath5 if and only if @xmath10 , i.e. irrespective of the actual size of the two weights . of course , as far as symmetry of @xmath7 is concerned , the sub - case where @xmath15 will be very different from the sub - case where @xmath16 .    in this paper , we present a simple procedure that tries to overcome this problem .",
    "more specifically , we develop a simple index that can help in deciding when the empirically - observed @xmath7 is sufficiently symmetric to justify an undirected network analysis .",
    "our index has two main properties .",
    "first , it can be applied with minor modifications to both binary and weighted networks .",
    "second , the standardized version of the index distributes as a standard normal ( over all possible matrices @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , after having set a threshold @xmath17 , one might conclude that the network is to be treated as if it is undirected if the index computed on @xmath7 is lower than @xmath17 .",
    "of course , the procedure that we propose in the paper is by no means a statistical test for the null hypothesis that @xmath7 involves some kind of symmetry .",
    "indeed , one has almost always to rely on a single observation for @xmath7 ( more on that in section [ section : conclusions ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the index studied here could possibly provide a simple way to ground the `` directed vs. undirected '' decision on more solid bases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : definition ] we define the index and we derive its basic properties .",
    "section [ section : statistical_properties ] discusses its statistical properties , while in section [ section : examples ] we apply the procedure to the empirical networks extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , section [ section : conclusions ] concludes .",
    "consider a directed , weighted , graph @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of nodes and @xmath20 is the @xmath1 ( real - valued ) matrix of link `` weights '' @xcite . without loss of generality",

    "a directed edge from @xmath4 to @xmath5 is present if and only if @xmath26 .",
    "the idea underlying the construction of the index is very simple . if the graph @xmath27 is undirected , then @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the transpose of @xmath30 . denoting by @xmath31 any norm defined on a square - matrix , the extent to which directionality of links counts in the graph @xmath27 can therefore be measured by some increasing function of @xmath32 , suitably rescaled by some increasing function of @xmath33 ( and possibly of @xmath34 ) .    to build the index we first define , again without loss of generality :",

    "notice that @xmath41 is invariant with respect to the transpose operator , i.e. @xmath42 .",

    "[ eq : index_s_tilde ] turns out to be closely connected to the density of the graph ( i.e. , the ratio between the total number of directed links to the maximum possible number of directed links ) and the ratio of the number of bilateral directed links in @xmath54 ( i.e. links from @xmath4 to @xmath5 s.t .",

    "as mentioned in section [ section : introduction ] , @xmath59 can be employed to check for the extent to which directionality counts in @xmath54 . however , such index is not very useful in weighted graphs , as it does not take into account the size effect ( i.e. the size of weights as measured by @xmath66 $ ] ) .    in the case of binary graphs ,",
    "the index in almost coincides with the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "they suggest to employ the correlation coefficient between @xmath67 entries in the adjacency matrix ( excluding self loops ) .",
    "it can be shown that this alternative index  unlike the one in",

    "since @xmath68 $ ] , in what follows we shall employ its rescaled version :    @xmath69    which ranges in the unit interval and thus has a more straightforward interpretation .",
    "in this section we study the distribution of the index @xmath70 as defined in eqs .",
    "[ eq : index_s_tilde ] and [ eq : index_s ] . indeed , despite the range of @xmath70 does not depend on @xmath19 , we expect its distribution to be affected by : ( i ) the size of the matrix ( @xmath19 ) ; ( ii ) whether the underlying graph @xmath54 is binary ( @xmath55 ) or weighted ( @xmath49 $ ] ) .    to do so , for each @xmath71 we generate @xmath72 random matrices @xmath73 obeying the restriction that @xmath39 , all @xmath4 . in the binary case , out - of - diagonal entries @xmath74 are drawn from i.i.d .",

    "we then estimate the distributions of @xmath70 in both the binary and the weighted cases , and we study their behavior as the size of the graph increases .",
    "let us denote by @xmath78 ( respectively , @xmath79 ) the sample mean of the index @xmath70 in the binary ( respectively , weighted ) case , and by @xmath80 ( respectively , @xmath81 ) the sample standard deviation of the index @xmath70 in the binary ( respectively , weighted ) case .",
    "simulation results are summarized in the following points .    1 .   in both the binary and the weighted case",
    ", the index @xmath70 approximately distributes as a beta random variable for all @xmath19 . as @xmath19 increases , @xmath78 decreases towards 0.50 whereas @xmath79 increases towards 0.25 . both standard deviations decrease towards 0 .",
    "more precisely , the following approximate relations hold ( see figures [ fig : scaling_bern ] and [ fig : scaling_unif ] ) : + @xmath82 2 .   given the approximate relations in eqs .",
    "[ eq : mean_binary]-[eq : sd_weighted ] , let us standardize the index @xmath70 as follows : + @xmath83 + simulations indicate that the standardized versions of the index , i.e. @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are both well approximated by a @xmath86 , even for small @xmath19s ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "indeed , as figures [ fig : rescaled_bern ] and [ fig : rescaled_unif ] show , the mean of the distributions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 vs. @xmath19 converges towards zero , while the standard deviation approaches one ( we actually plot standard deviation minus one to have a plot in the same scale ) . also the third ( skewness ) and the fourth moment ( excess kurtosis ) stay close to zero .",
    "we also plot the estimated distribution of @xmath84 and @xmath85 vs. @xmath19 , see figures [ fig : distr_bern ] and [ fig : distr_unif ] .",
    "it can be seen that all estimated densities collapse towards a @xmath86 .",
    "notice that the y - axis is in log scale : this allows one to appreciate how close to a @xmath86 are the distributions for all @xmath19 on the tails .",
    "+ notice finally that as @xmath19 increases , the distribution maintains a constant second moment but the range increases linearly with @xmath19 , see [ fig : bounds_bern ] and [ fig : bounds_unif ]",
    ". the lower bound ( lb ) and the upper bound ( ub ) indeed read approximately : + @xmath88 + where @xmath89 stands for binary ( b ) and weighted ( w ) .",
    "since the standardized index is well approximated by a @xmath86 for all @xmath19 , this means that extreme values become more and more unlikely .",
    "this is intuitive , because as @xmath19 grows the number of matrices with highest / lowest values of the index are very rare .",
    "the index developed above can be easily employed to assess the extent to which link directionality matters in real - world networks .",
    "let us suppose to have estimated a @xmath90 matrix @xmath91 describing a binary ( b ) or a weighted ( w ) graph .",

    "[ eq : mean_binary]-[eq : sd_weighted ] .",
    "since we know that @xmath94 is approximately @xmath86 , we can fix a lower threshold in order to decide whether the network is sufficiently ( un)directed . for instance , we could set the lower threshold equal to 0 ( i.e. equal to the mean ) , and decide that if @xmath95 ( above the mean ) we shall treat the network as directed ( and undirected otherwise ) .",
    "more generally , one might set a threshold equal to @xmath96 and conclude that the graph is undirected if @xmath97 . on the contrary",
    ", one should expect the directional nature of the graph to be sufficiently strong , so that a digraph analysis is called for .    to test the index against real - world cases , we have taken the thirteen social and economic networks analyzed in @xcite , see table [ tab : example ] .",

    "padgett s networks , being undirected , display a very low value ( in fact , the non standardized index is equal to zero as expected ) .",
    "the table also suggests to treat all the binary trade networks as undirected .",
    "the same advice applies for freeman s networks , which are instead weighted .",
    "the only networks which have an almost clear directed nature ( according to our threshold ) are krackhardt s ones . in that case",
    "our index indicates that a directed graph analysis would be more appropriate .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new procedure that might help to decide whether an empirically - observed adjacency or weights @xmath1 matrix @xmath7 , describing the graph underlying a social or economic network , is sufficiently symmetric to justify an undirected network analysis .",
    "the index that we have developed has two main properties .",
    "first , it can be applied to both binary or weighted graphs .",
    "second , once suitably standardized , it distributes as a standard normal over all possible adjacency / weights matrices .",
    "therefore , given a threshold decided by the researcher , any empirically observed adjacency / weights matrix displaying a value of the index lower ( respectively , higher ) than the threshold is to be treated as if it characterizes an undirected ( respectively , directed ) network .",
    "it must be noticed that setting the threshold always relies on a personal choice , as also happens in statistical hypothesis tests with the choice of the significance level @xmath100 . despite this unavoidable degree of freedom ,",
    "the procedure proposed above still allows for a sufficient comparability among results coming from different studies ( i.e. where researchers set different threshold ) if both the value of the index @xmath70 and the size of the network are documented in the analysis . in that case",
    ", one can easily compute the probability of finding a matrix with a lower / higher degree of symmetry , simply by using the definition of bounds ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : bounds ] ) and probability tables for the standard normal .",
    "a final remark is in order . as mentioned",
    ", our procedure does not configure itself as a statistical test . since the researcher often relies on a single observation of the network under study ( or a sequence of serially - correlated network snapshots through time ) , statistical hypothesis testing will be only very rarely feasible .",
    "nevertheless , in the case where a sample of @xmath101 i.i.d .",
    "observations of @xmath7 is available , one might consider to use the the sample average of the index ( multiplied by @xmath102 ) and employ the cental limit theorem to test the hypothesis that the observations come from a undirected ( random ) graph .",
    "this work has enormously benefited from insightful suggestions by michel petitjean .",
