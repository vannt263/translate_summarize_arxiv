    "we would like to remind the reader that @xmath22-annihilation into fermion pairs is described by a gauge invariant , unitary and analytic scattering amplitude @xcite : @xmath23 the proper formalism for its perturbative calculation has been derived in @xcite and its application at two - loop accuracy is described in ref .",

    "we here calculate the bosonic two - loop contribution to the ( complex ) ratio @xmath49 .",
    "the determination of the pseudo - observables in eq .   from true observables requires carefully written interfaces for the unfolding and subtraction of qed , qcd and box contributions , and other contributions not contained in the pseudo - observables ; see refs .",
    "in fact , the interfaces implemented in zfitter @xcite have proven to be adequate for an analysis of @xmath17-pole pseudo - observables at the @xmath13 level @xcite .",
    "the experimental values for @xmath16 and @xmath14 from a global fit to the lep and slc data are @xcite : @xmath50    a challenge has been the evaluation of two - loop vertex integrals in the minkowskian kinematic region .",
    "the vertices involve up to three additional mass scales besides @xmath51 , and many of them also contain ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities , even though the divergencies cancel in the final result . in general , it is not possible to compute all integrals analytically with available methods and tools , but instead one has to resort to numerical integration strategies .",
    "the techniques used in this work are discussed in section  [ sec:2l ] .",
    "results for the numerical impact of the new corrections are presented in section  [ sec : res ] , before the summary in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the complete set of two - loop integrals required for this calculation can be divided into several categories . for the renormalization",

    "in addition , there are two - loop vertex integrals with one non - vanishing external momentum squared , @xmath54 .",
    "two - loop self - energy integrals and vertex integrals with self - energy subloops have been computed using the dispersion relation techniques described in refs .",
    "the remaining two - loop vertex integrals with triangle subloops amount to some 700 integrals , with tensor rank @xmath55 , minkowskian external momentum , and up to three dimensionless parameters per integral , from the set @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , besides @xmath58 .",
    "the aim is an accuracy of eight significant digits , to be obtained with two completely independent calculations .",
    "a variety of integrals were calculated already for the leptonic @xmath17 boson asymmetry parameter @xmath59 . here , up to two dimensionless parameters had to be treated @xcite . in view of the larger number of scales encountered in the @xmath60 vertex , and",
    "also aiming at comparably simple and semi - automatic algorithms with easy re - use , a fully numerical strategy was applied here . no reduction to a minimal set of master integrals was attempted , except for simple cancellations of numerator and denominator terms .",
    "if such a reduction were performed , one could obtain numerically large coefficients for some of the master integrals , thus resulting in reduced precision of the final result .    as was mentioned above",
    ", individual integrals will contain both uv and/or soft and collinear divergencies .",
    "we have employed two techniques with an automatic control of these divergencies : sector decomposition ( sd ) and mellin barnes ( mb ) representations .",
    "it is essential that the numerical methods work sufficiently stable for minkowskian kinematics . for sector decomposition @xcite",
    "this can be achieved through a complex contour deformation of the feynman parameter integrals , as implemented in the publicly available packages fiesta 3 @xcite since 2013 and secdec 3 @xcite since 2015 .",
    "nevertheless , we observe serious convergence problems for some of our integrals . as a second , independent method we chose the representation of feynman integrals by mellin - barnes integrals @xcite .",
    "the mb method has been well developed in recent years and there are useful software packages available at the mbtools webpage in the hepforge archive @xcite : mb @xcite , mbresolve @xcite , ambre 1 @xcite and barnesroutines ( d.  kosower ) .",

    "ambre  2 has been employed for _ planar _ and ambre 3 for _ non - planar _ topologies , using planaritytest for the automatic identification of the planarity status . for the numerical treatment of massive mb integrals with minkowskian kinematics ,",

    "a comprehensive description of our numerical package @xcite , including a discussion of the numerical derivation of the @xmath62 integrals will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for _ euclidean kinematics _ all the needed integrals can be evaluated straightforwardly with sector decomposition , using the packages fiesta and secdec .",
    "one obtains feynman parameter integrals with 4 or 5 dimensions . for _ minkowskian kinematics _ the numerical sd method still works well for most of the integrals ,",

    "now let us turn to the treatment of _ minkowskian kinematics _ with the mb method .",
    "from a technical point of view , one has to integrate over products and ratios of @xmath79-functions and their derivatives , multiplied by products of terms like @xmath80^{f(z_i)}$ ] . here",

    "there is a variety of methods to improve the convergence of minkowskian mb integrals .",
    "we mention here those which proved to be most efficient , but refer for details to the literature @xcite :    * _ integrand mappings . _ before applying a standard integration routine like cuhre , we found a tangent mapping to be efficient , @xmath86 , combined with calculating @xmath87 $ ] rather than the product @xmath88 . *",

    "however , for single - scale integrals , which depend only on @xmath91^{f(z_i ) } = ( -1-i\\varepsilon)^{f(z_i)}$ ] , the contour rotation will not improve the behaviour at infinity . * _ contour shifts . _",
    "it proved to be extremely efficient to make use of a well - known property of @xmath79-functions : they become numerically smaller when taken at larger arguments , as it is quantified by the stirling formula . if a pole gets crossed , one has to add the corresponding residue which by itself is also an integral , but will have a dimension less than the original one . doing this several times , with several integration variables ,",
    "the original mb integral gets replaced by several lower - dimensional integrals which may be easier to calculate , plus the original one with shifted integration path .",
    "the resulting smaller contribution of the original integral to the net result has the effect that its poor knowledge gets numerically less important . in effect , the procedure consists of a summing over a finite number of residues with a controlled remainder .",
    "shifts of the integration contours were proposed first in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the package mbnumerics is yet under development .",
    "currently , it can treat minkowskian mb integrals with up to four dimensions and euclidean ones with up to five dimensions with a good precision , and with more dimensions at reduced precision . the package is currently limited to integrals with few different mass scales .",
    "there is the opportunity of internal cross - checks by integral reductions with the package kira @xcite , followed by a numerical evaluation with mbnumerics.m .",
    "this procedure was used for few integrals where a second calculation was difficult , and an accuracy of at least 6 digits was reached in these cases for the second calculations .",
    "further improvement is possible , but the result is more than sufficient for the purposes of the present calculation .    we will complete this section with a few numerical examples .",
    "the planar ir divergent integral [ fig - samples ] ( d ) depends on @xmath92 and on @xmath29 , @xmath93 , i.e. on two dimensionless parameters .",

    "the one - scale integrals have up to four mb dimensions and were the testing ground during the development of mbnumerics @xcite .",
    "one may calculate all these integrals using the results of @xcite .",
