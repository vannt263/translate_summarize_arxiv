    "of the about 2000 known pulsars , only around 400 have measured flux density spectra . for most of these cases ,",
    "the flux density spectra can be described using a power - law of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes observing frequency , with negative spectral index @xmath4 of about @xmath11.8 ; or by a combination of two power laws @xmath5 with spectral indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 with average values of @xmath10.9 and @xmath12.2 respectively , with a break frequency @xmath8 , which is typically around 1.5 ghz @xcite .",
    "the population of pulsars with such break in the spectra is about 10% of the sample analysed by @xcite , and it is usually assumed that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are negative with @xmath7 being steeper than @xmath6 . for pulsars which can be observed at low frequencies ( i.e. about 100 - 600 mhz ) , a low frequency turnover is observed in the spectra  @xcite . in some cases , positive spectral indices have also been observed between 400 mhz and 1600 mhz  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed the first direct evidence of a high frequency turnover in radio pulsar spectra using multi - frequency flux measurements for candidates chosen from the objects which showed a decrease of flux density at frequencies below 1 ghz .",
    "the frequency at which such a spectrum shows the maximum flux is called the peak frequency @xmath9 .",
    "later , @xcite presented a new class of objects , called gigahertz - peaked spectra ( gps ) pulsars .",
    "these sources exhibit a turnover in their spectra at high frequencies with @xmath10 about 1 ghz or above .",
    "to analyse the shapes of gigahertz - peaked spectra we use a function @xmath11 previously proposed for similar studies of pulsar spectra with turnover at low frequencies  @xcite .",
    "gps pulsars have been demonstrated to be relatively young objects , and have a high dispersion measures ( @xmath12 pc @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "they usually adjoin interesting and often dense objects in their vicinity , e.g. hii regions , compact pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "in addition , it seems that they are coincident with known but sometimes unidentified x - ray sources from 3rd egret catalogue or hess observations .",
    "this in turn suggests that the high frequency turnover owes to the environmental conditions around neutron stars and/or the physical properties of the interstellar medium .",
    "though gps pulsars represent the smallest group of radio pulsar spectra types today , @xcite estimate that the number of such sources may be as much as 10% of the whole pulsar population .",
    "it is obvious that without a more extensive sample of these sources , it is not possible to constrain reliably any statistics of their properties .",
    "the evolution of the spectrum of psr b1259@xmath163 with orbital phase can be treated as a key factor to define physical mechanisms which can be potentially responsible for the gps phenomenon .",
    "the object is in a unique binary system with a massive ( 10m@xmath13 ) , main - sequence , be star ls2883 with a radius of 6r@xmath13 .",
    "psr b1259@xmath163 is a middle - aged pulsar ( 330 kyr ) with a relatively short period of 48 ms .",
    "its average dm is about 147 pc @xmath0 .",
    "the system is an eccentric binary ( @xmath14 ) with an orbital period of 3.4 yr and a projected semi - major axis , @xmath15 , of 1300 light seconds ( 2.6 au ) .",
    "@xcite used published data @xcite to show that at various orbital phases of the binary , the radio spectrum of psr b1259@xmath163 mimics that of pulsars with the gps .",
    "the authors also presented evidence for evolution of the spectrum of the pulsar due to its orbital motion , along with the peak frequency dependence on the orbital phase .",
    "@xcite proposed two possible causes of the observed variation in the spectra : free - free absorption in the stellar wind and cyclotron resonance in the magnetic field associated with a disk of the be star . this observed evolution of the psr b1259@xmath163 spectrum seems to be the most convincing proof for an environmental origin of the gps phenomenon .",
    "@xcite studied the radio spectra of two magnetars psrs j1550@xmath15418 and j1622@xmath14950 , which clearly show turnover at frequencies of a few ghz .",
    "both these magnetars are associated with supernova remnants , and thus are surrounded by a hot , ionized gas which can be responsible for the free - free absorption of radio waves .",
    "the authors concluded that the gps feature in radio spectra of magnetars can be caused by external factors , in the same way as it occurs in the environment of gps pulsars .",
    "recently @xcite presented the spectrum of a newly discovered pulsar psr j2007 + 2722 which shows a high frequency turnover ( see tab .  5 in their paper ) .",
    "it is possible that psr j2007 + 2722 is a young pulsar that was born with a relatively weak magnetic field and with a birth period longer than it is usually assumed . in this case , with its @xmath16 pc @xmath0 , the object seems to be similar to other gps pulsars .",
    "the distance of 5.4 kpc , corresponding to the dm value , can be the reason why there has not been mention about a snr or a pwn around psr j2007 + 2722 .",
    "in this paper we present flux measurements for 21 pulsars , resulting from observations at both low and high frequencies .",
    "the sample was chosen from objects suspected to be gps pulsars .",
    "the results of our observations allow us to indicate several new sources showing gps properties , and also strong gps candidates .",
    "we concluded with a revisit of the source selection criteria for future searches for gps pulsars .",
    "we present in this paper the flux density measurements collected during two observing projects .",
    "we were able to successfully measure the flux densities of 12 pulsars at 610 mhz and to estimate upper limits for another 4 pulsars , from observations in may 2010 using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt , near pune , india ) , see also  @xcite .",
    "we also used the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope for flux density measurements of 11 pulsars at 2.6 ghz , 4.85 ghz and 8.35 ghz in november 2012 .",
    "the main purpose of these observations was to find more pulsars showing gigahertz - peaked spectra .",
    "we chose the sources to be observed with the gmrt from a set of newly discovered pulsars with periods between 0.1 and 2.0 seconds , whose flux density measurements at 1.4 ghz are available in the atnf catalogue .",
    "the observations were conducted in the phased array mode of the gmrt  @xcite , with the available 16 mhz bandwidth divided into 256 channels , and using a sampling rate of 0.512 ms .",
    "the typical integration time was about 30 min ( for more details see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "for the effelsberg observing project we selected pulsars based on our gmrt observations , along with data from the atnf catalogue and  @xcite .",
    "objects which appeared to have a flat spectrum or a positive spectral index below a frequency of 1 ghz were selected . to ascertain the full shape of the spectrum it was necessary to measure the flux densities at frequencies above 2 ghz .",
    "for these observations , we used the secondary focus receivers ( with cooled hemt amplifiers ) with bandwidth of 100 mhz at 2.6 ghz , 500 mhz at 4.85 ghz and 1100 mhz at 8.35 ghz .",
    "these receivers provided circularly polarised lhc and rhc signals , digitized and independently sampled with 1024 bins per period , and synchronously folded using the topocentric pulsar rotational period  @xcite .",
    "the typical integration time was around 20 - 25 min .",
    "the observations were intensity calibrated by the use of a noise diode and known continuum radio sources ( ngc 7027 , 3c 286 , 3c 345 ) .",
    "table  [ tab_flux ] combines the weighted means of all flux density measurements and their uncertainties for our sample of 21 pulsars , acquired at different frequencies with the gmrt and the effelsberg observing projects .",
    "most sources in our sample have high dms and hence the flux density variations caused by interstellar scintillations should be minimal .",
    "nevertheless , observations at each frequency ( with a few exceptions ) were conducted at 2 - 3 different epochs to give us reliable estimates of the average flux and its uncertainties , which are used to construct the spectra for these pulsars , in combination with flux density data available from literature . in tab .",

    "[ other2 ] are potential candidates for broken spectra type with break frequencies 700 mhz and 2.3 ghz , respectively .",
    "the data for psr b1916 + 14 , as in the case of psr j1852@xmath10635 , was matched to the three different functions , and we obtained reasonable fits with the following parameters :    * @xmath34 jy , @xmath35  ns , @xmath36 for function presented in eq .",

    "one has to remember that almost all the above pulsars ( with the only exceptions being psrs b1811 + 40 and b1916 + 14 ) are objects with relatively high dms .",
    "therefore , using the standard pulsar flux measurement methods for these objects can cause erroneous results , especially when the observations are conducted at low observing frequencies where the pulsars are significantly affected by scattering .",
    "this typically happens when scattering tail is long enough to be a significant fraction of the pulsar period . in such cases",

    "we also present the spectra for 17 other pulsars , 13 of which are constructed for the first time . among these , three sources can be considered as good candidates for gigahertz - peaked spectra pulsars .",
    "both the newly identified gps pulsars are relatively young objects ( 115kyr for psr  j1740 + 1000 and 567 kyr for psr  j1852@xmath10635 ) , which is a common characteristic for other known gps pulsars .",
    "we have to note that psr  j1740 + 1000 is the first object exhibiting this phenomenon that has a low dm ( 24  pc  @xmath0 ) .    in case of psr  j1740 + 1000 we present the spectrum over a wide frequency range , which is an improvement with regard to the previously published one @xcite . the new spectrum still contains the flux measurement at 1170  mhz ( see fig .  [ j1740 ] ) which is unusually low compared to measurements at nearby frequencies , and we consider it to be unreliable and excluded it from the spectral fitting procedure .",
    "the reason for this may be interstellar scintillations ( as suggested in the discovery paper , @xcite @xcite ) , and we plan to address this issue with future observations near the frequency of 1  ghz .",
    "for the other new gps pulsar we only want to mention that the 1.4  ghz measurement ( full circle in fig .",
    "[ j1852 ] ) is also slightly lower than the shape of the spectra ( based on our data ) would suggest .",
    "this measurement was obtained by @xcite and published in the parkes discovery paper .    for the majority of the remaining pulsars we obtained spectral indices which range from + 0.3 to @xmath12.0 .",
    "six of these can be considered to indicate flat spectra ( @xmath46 ) . from our sample ,",
    "we have selected three good gps candidates .",
    "one of these sources is psr  j1705@xmath13950 , with the spectral index @xmath47 based on observations made at two frequencies only ( see fig .",
    "[ other1 ] ) .",
    "because of its low declination we were unable to obtain flux measurements at high frequencies using the effelsberg radio telescope ; such measurements would be possible only using australian telescopes .",
    "the other two candidates , psr  j1812@xmath12102 and j1834@xmath10731 , show typical spectra at high frequencies , but the flux density upper limits we obtained at 610  mhz suggest that the spectra deviate from a simple power - law which may be an indication of a possible gps behaviour .      summarizing , after the addition of the two new identifications presented here , we now have 11 gps pulsars known .",
    "this number includes six objects presented in @xcite , two radio magnetars @xcite , and psr   j2007 + 2722 presented by @xcite .",
    "this will definitely improve the statistics , which is important when trying to make reliable conclusions about general properties of this class of objects ( both pulsars and radio magnetars ) .",
    "however , the still relatively small sample of gps pulsars , and no direct correlation between spectra shapes and physical parameters ( internal or external ) that could affect the radiation properties implies a still somewhat limited understanding of the properties of these objects as a group .",
    "thus , successful searches for more gps pulsars and low frequency flux measurements in radio pulsars are very important .",
    "the first of the new gps pulsars presented here , psr j1740 + 1000 , was discovered in an arecibo survey  @xcite and reported to have an unusually high positive spectral index of 0.9  @xcite , which made it a good candidate object .",
    "the new observations indeed appear to be sufficient to identify the psr j1740 + 1000 spectrum as a gps - type .",
    "the object is very interesting from several points of view .",
    "xmm - newton observations have revealed the existence of a pwn around the pulsar with a complex morphology ( very extended pulsar tail , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "later , @xcite reported absorption features in the x - ray spectrum of this ordinary rotation - powered radio pulsar and concluded that some of these features , thought to be unusual in nuetron star spectra , are probably more common than earlier expected .",
    "the authors believe that their findings bridge the gap between the spectra of pulsars and other , more exotic neutron stars , i.e. `` x - ray dim isolated nss '' ( xdinss ) , central compact objects ( ccos ) , and `` rotating radio transients '' ( rrats ) . psr j1740 + 1000 was also considered by  @xcite as a candidate `` sub - luminous '' @xmath48-ray pulsar .",
    "additionally , psr j1740 + 1000 reveals a new aspect of pulsars with gigahertz - peaked spectra : with a dm of 24 @xmath49 ( which along this line of sight corresponds to a distance of 1.2 kpc  @xcite @xcite ) , it is much closer to us than other objects of this kind .    due to the high dispersion measures of the gps pulsars that were presented by  @xcite and  @xcite",
    ", it has been suspected that high dm may have an important role to play in producing the gps feature in radio pulsar spectra .",
    "however , with the recent gps identifications reported here , it looks more likely that the effect may be related more to the environmental conditions in the close vicinity of these objects , rather than to the value of the dm . if that is the case , then the apparent observational trend for the gps pulsars to prefer higher dm values may be a pure selection effect .",
    "as the gps phenomenon is rather a rare occurrence it is obvious the chance for finding such objects increases with the size of the volume searched .",
    "this however does not exclude the possibility of finding such objects at relatively low distances .",
    "the case of psr  b1259@xmath163 shows that the gps feature observed in the spectrum can be caused by the absorption effects in the near vicinity of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "our results for psr  j1740 + 1000 definitely support that idea , as it is another object with a peculiar environment , which makes it very similar to other gps pulsars and magnetars .",
    "an alternative mechanism , the flux dilution ( which is caused by anomalous scattering ) may also lead to a decrease of energy at lower frequencies , hence it may change the appearance of pulsar radio spectra ( j. cordes    private communication ) . however , this would be somewhat difficult to explain the case of psr  j1740 + 1000 , which is a relatively nearby source and hence likely to be less affected by strong scattering effects .",
    "in their recent statistical study  @xcite concluded gps sources may possibly constitute up to 10% of the whole pulsar population , which could add up to as many as 200 objects .",
    "we believe that the currently small size of the gps pulsar sample does not come from the fact that they are a rare phenomenon , but rather from our limited knowledge of pulsar spectra in general , especially at frequencies below 1  ghz .",
    "the gps phenomena in radio magnetars along with the first low dm gps pulsar reported here lead us to revisit our criteria of selecting candidate gps sources . in the future searches ,",
    "we would focus on sources with interesting ( or extreme ) environment rather than those with high dm .",
    "this would make the objects with pwns / snrs found in high - energy observations excelent gps pulsar candidates , and vice - versa , the sources with identified gps would be good targets for high - energy observations",
    ".    low frequency flux density measurements , which are crucial in searching for new gps pulsars , can be difficult ( or sometimes impossible ) to conduct in the traditional way due to some of the known effects of interstellar medium .",
    "thus , we are able to determine pulsar flux densities using the standard on and off pulse energy estimates only when the scattering time is small enough .",
    "many of the candidates for gps pulsars have very high dispersion measures and at the lower frequencies they are not observable by means of regular pulsar observations , due to the extreme scattering which can smear their emission over the entire rotational period .",
    "this makes the observed radiation unpulsed ( in extreme cases ) , or at least distorts the profile baseline to a degree that negates the standard means of making the flux density measurement .",
    "for these cases , the only way to determine the pulsar flux is using interferometric continuum imaging techniques ( see for example @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the interferometric imaging technique is important in these cases , providing an alternative for the typical pulsar observations and making possible verification of the gigahertz - peaked spectra , especially in the case of strong pulse scatter - broadening  @xcite .",
