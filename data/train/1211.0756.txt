    "since the discovery of cosmic acceleration @xcite , dark energy has become one of the most popular research areas in cosmology @xcite .",
    "numerous dark energy models have been proposed in the last decade .",
    "however , the nature of dark energy still remains a mystery .    actually , the dark energy problem may be in essence an issue of quantum gravity @xcite . in the absent of a complete theory of quantum gravity ,",
    "the most plausible approach is to consider some effective theories , in which some fundamental principles are taken into account .",
    "it is commonly believed that the holographic principle is a fundamental principle of quantum gravity @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "based on the effective quantum field theory , cohen _ et al .",
    "_ suggested that quantum zero - energy energy of a system with size @xmath7 shall not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , i.e. , @xmath8 here @xmath3 is the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff which is closely related to the zero - point energy density , and @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass . in this way , the uv cutoff of the system is related to its infrared ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle can be viewed as dark energy .",
    "the largest ir cutoff @xmath7 is chosen by saturating the inequality , so we get the dark energy density @xmath10 where @xmath0 is a dimensionless model parameter . in @xcite",
    ", li suggested to choose the future event horizon of the universe as the ir cutoff of this theory , defined as , @xmath11 this choice not only gives a reasonable value for the dark energy density , but also leads to an accelerated universe .    the holographic dark energy ( hde ) model based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : rh ] ) has been proved to be a promising dark energy candidate .",
    "the the original paper @xcite , li showed that the hde model can explain the coincidence problem . in @xcite , it is proved that the model is perturbation stable .",
    "following studies also show that the model is in good agreement with the current cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "thus , the hde model becomes one of the most competitive and popular dark energy candidates , and attracts a lot of interests @xcite .    in spite of its success ,",
    "the hde model still suffers from some criticisms @xcite , due to its use of the future event horizon as the present cutoff . in this model ,",
    "the evolution of the universe depends on the future information about the universe , so there is a causality problem . and , the future event horizon exists only in an accelerating universe , so there is a circular logic problem if one use an assumption based on the accelerating expansion to explain the accelerating expansion . besides , the lack of derivation of the model from an action is also a blemish .",
    "these problems remain unsolved since the proposal of the model in 2002 .",
    "fortunately , these problems are solved in a recent work of li and miao @xcite .",
    "for the first time , they derived a holographic dark energy model ( hereafter the new hde model ) from the action principle . in the new model ,",
    "the evolution of the universe only depends on the present state of the universe , clearly showing that it obeys the law of causality .",
    "furthermore , in the new model the use of future event horizon as a present cut - off is not an input but automatically follows from equations of motion .",
    "so the puzzles of causality and circular logic are all completely solved . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that the new hde model is very similar to the original hde model , except a new term which may be interestingly explained as dark radiation @xcite .",
    "it is worth investigating such an interesting model by confronting it with the current cosmological observations .",
    "that will enable us to answer a lot of interesting questions : is the model consistent with the current data ?",
    "what regions of parameters space are allowed by data ? in the original hde model , the big - rip fate of the universe is favored by the data , what is the fate of universe in the new hde models ? and so on .",
    "these issues are not covered in @xcite , and will be explored in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief introduction to the new hde model . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the dynamical behaviors and the cosmic expansion history of the model , and discuss how they are related with the model parameter @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iv , we fit the model to the combined union2.1+bao+cmb+@xmath1 data , and present the fittings results . many interesting issues , including the eos of the new hde , the fate of the universe , the dark radiation , are discussed . some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "v. in this work , we assume today s scale factor @xmath12 , so the redshift @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "we use negative redshift to denote the future , and @xmath15 corresponds the far future @xmath16 .",
    "the subscript `` 0 '' indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity unless otherwise specified .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce the new hde model proposed in @xcite .      following @xcite , we review how the model is derived from the action principle .",

    "we find @xmath66 basically uncorrelated with the other parameters ( see e.g. the right panel of fig . [",
    "fig : neff ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ode_z ] , we plot the reconstructed evolution of the ratio of the new hde along with the scale factor @xmath178 , from the past @xmath179 to the future @xmath180 . we find that , in the future we have @xmath181 due to the domination of the dark energy component , while in the past there is an evident contribution from the dark radiation component , with the ratio @xmath182 ( 95.4% cl )",
    ". a negative component of dark radiation is allowed by data .    to make a comparison",
    ", we also plot the evolution of the dark energy ratio of the best - fit @xmath3cdm model ( thick black dashed line ) .",
    "we find that new hde and @xmath3cdm agree with each other at the 2@xmath153 cl in most epoch , except the @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) region . in this region ,",
    "the eos of new hde significantly deviates from -1 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : wz ] ) . at the earlier epoch ,",
    "the dark energy ratio is negligible , and the discrepancy between the two models becomes undetectable .",
    "the dark radiation component also has evident influence on the cosmic age @xmath185 .",
    "for the @xmath3cdm model with standard value of @xmath186 the age is @xmath187 from the wmap7+bao+@xmath1 data ( see @xcite ) , while for the new hde model we find @xmath188 gyr . due to the dark radiation contribution ,",
    "the best - fit value shrinks , and the error bars are evidently amplified .",
    "we find our result of @xmath66 consistent with the previous works on dark radiation , e.g. , @xmath189 from wmap7+act @xcite , and @xmath190 from wmap9+act+spt @xcite .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that our estimation of @xmath66 obtained from the wmap and bao distance priors , is very rough .",
    "to get accurate estimation on @xmath66 , one shall adopt the full cmb power spectrum data .",
    "in this work we discuss the cosmological interpretations of the new hde model @xcite . derived from the action principle , this model overcomes the causality and circular problems in the original hde model @xcite , and is very similar to the original hde model , except a new term which can be interpreted as dark radiation .",
    "first of all , we investigate the dynamical properties and cosmic expansion history of the new hde model .",
    "we confirm the conclusion of @xcite that the equations of motion force @xmath191 , making @xmath29 exactly the future event horizon .",
    "we also confirm that the dark energy eos satisfies @xmath192 at high redshift . among the six sets of model parameters considered , the expansion histories of three @xmath56 cases are more closed to the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "then we put constraints on the model from the union2.1+bao+cmb+@xmath1 data .",
    "we get the goodness - of - fit @xmath2 , which is comparable with the results of the original hde model ( 549.461 ) and the concordant @xmath3cdm model ( 550.354 ) obtained using the same set of data @xcite .",
    "thus , the new hde model provides a nice fit to the data ,    when we assess different models by using the information criteria , we find the new hde model is disfavored due to its extra model parameters . compared with the @xmath3cdm model , it has a large @xmath193 .",
    "it means that such a complicate model is not mandatory to explain the current cosmological observations . however , theoretically it is always interesting to investigate the cosmological constraints on this model , and determine the region of parameter space allowed by data .    for the constraints on parameters , we get @xmath4 ( 95.4% cl ) , implying the big rip fate of the universe at a high confidence level .",
    "correspondingly , we have @xmath168 and the big rip time from now @xmath194 gyr @xmath195 gyr ( all 95.4% cl ) . for the amount of dark radiation",
    ", we get a rough estimation @xmath6 , with the central value slightly larger than 3.046 and a negative component of dark radiation allowed .    by reconstructing the evolution of the dark energy and dark radiation density",
    ", we find the results of new hde differ from the @xmath3cdm at @xmath196 . in this region ,",
    "the eos of new hde of significantly deviates from -1 .",
    "however , due to the relatively low ratio of dark energy density in the this epoch , this difference only mildly affects the evolution of the scale factor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expansionhistory2 ] .",
    "finally , we mention that we did not investigate the perturbations in the new hde model .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to investigate the region of parameter space allowed by the cosmological observations , and discuss the properties of this model ( e.g. , evolution of @xmath91 ) based on the constraint .",
    "the evolution of scale factor in this model is similar to the standard @xmath3cdm model , so the perturbations calculation shall not lead to significantly improvement on the constraint .",
    "moreover , the current cosmic expansion history observations are more powerful than the growth of structure data in constraining dark energy .",
    "thus , in this paper we take an economical approach and only consider the constraints from the expansion history data .",
