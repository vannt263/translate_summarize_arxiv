    "newton s root - finding method is as old as analysis , and it is known to be a very efficient method for _ locally _ finding approximate roots of smooth equations such as polynomials : once a reasonable approximation to a simple root is known , every iteration of the newton method doubles the number of valid digits . however , newton s method is known to be difficult to understand as a _ global _ dynamical system . for instance , the following difficulties may arise , even in the case of a polynomial @xmath7 in a single complex variable :    * orbits of the newton map that get close to zeroes of the derivative @xmath8 will , under the newton dynamics , jump near @xmath9 and will take a long time until they can get close to roots ; * there may be open sets in @xmath10 in which the newton dynamics does not converge to any root of @xmath7 ; * the boundary of the attracting basins of the various roots may have positive measure , resulting in `` bad '' starting points of positive measure ; * even if almost all starting points in @xmath10 converge to _ some _ root of @xmath7 , it is not clear to find starting points for all roots : it is conceivable that some roots can be found only from small sets of starting points ( we do not want to use deflation : it is numerically unstable unless the roots are found in a certain order , and it may destroy specific forms of the polynomial that are easy to evaluate ) ; * finally , even if all roots are found , no efficient estimates on the required number of iterations were known previously .",
    "this manuscript addresses all these issues : we specify , for arbitrary polynomials in a single complex variable , a universal set of starting points ( depending only on the degree and some normalization ) from which _ all _ roots of _ all _ polynomials of given degree are found , and so that the required number of iterations ( or arithmetic complexity ) is of similar magnitude as fast known methods of polynomial root - finding : it is @xmath11 in the worst case , and @xmath12 or even @xmath13 on average ( up to factors of @xmath6 ) .",
    "more precisely , we will prove the following theorem :    for every degree @xmath14 , let @xmath15 be the set of complex polynomials of degree @xmath0 , normalized so that all roots are in the complex unit disk @xmath16 .",
    "then there is an explicit and finite universal set @xmath17 consisting of @xmath18 points in @xmath10 with the following property :    * for every @xmath19 , written as @xmath20 , there are @xmath0 points @xmath21 with @xmath22 as @xmath23 .    given @xmath24 ,",
    "let @xmath25 be so that @xmath26 .",
    "then the required number of iterations is bounded as follows .",
    "* * worst - case complexity : * we always have @xmath27 * * average complexity : * if the roots @xmath28 of @xmath7 are all simple and have mutual distance at least @xmath29 for some @xmath30 , then @xmath31 in particular , if the roots are randomly placed in @xmath16 , then the expected number of iterations is @xmath32 .",
    "further improvements based on our methods even show that _ for randomly placed roots in @xmath16 , one can expect @xmath33 _ @xcite .",
    "this result measures the complexity in terms of newton iterations .",
    "of course , each newton iteration requires arithmetic complexity @xmath0 ( at least the @xmath0 coefficients of @xmath7 have to be processed ) , but the evaluation of a given polynomial @xmath7 of degree @xmath0 at @xmath0 different points simultaneously is possible with arithmetic complexity @xmath34 using fast fourier transform methods @xcite .",
    "therefore , the arithmetic complexity differs from the complexity in terms of newton iterations only by a factor of @xmath6 : there would be little gain to implement the newton method on a parallel computer because the method is intrinsically parallel even for classical computers with von neumann architecture .    _ polynomial root - finding .",
    "_ there is an enormous literature on polynomial root - finding ; see for instance mcnamee s surveys  @xcite .",
    "newton s method has been considered difficult to analyze : for instance , pan @xcite writes `` theoretically , the weak point of these algorithms is their heuristic character .",
    " moreover , in spite of intensive effort of many researchers , convergence of these algorithms has been proved only in the cases where the initial point is already close to a zero or where another similar condition is satisfied . ''",
    "our approach is not meant to compete with existing ( sometimes rather elaborated and complicated ) algorithms .",
    "our point is to show that the classical simple and stable ( and elegant ) newton method is far more efficient than anticipated ; the arithmetic complexity in our main theorem in the average case differs from fast known algorithms ( such as @xcite ) only by a logarithmic factor , and it could be a useful ingredient in more efficient algorithms .",

    "as long as we focus attention on a single root , we call it @xmath41 and its immediate basin @xmath42 .",

    "_ overview of the arguments and structure of the paper . _",
    "the fundamental idea of this paper is the _ area used per iteration step_. we consider @xmath38-orbits @xmath49 that stay in a certain disk @xmath50 for @xmath51 (  @xmath52-central orbits ) .",
    "we partition @xmath50 into domains @xmath53 so that for @xmath54 , the nearest root has distance approximately @xmath55 from @xmath56 .",
    "this will imply that @xmath57 .",
    "we will have orbits @xmath49 in the immediate basin @xmath42 of @xmath41 for which the hyperbolic distance @xmath58 .",
    "roughly speaking , euclidean distance bounded below by @xmath59 and hyperbolic distance bounded above by @xmath6 means that @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be connected by a hyperbolic geodesic segment @xmath62 that has euclidean distance at least @xmath63 from the boundary , so this curve `` uses up '' an area of approximately @xmath64 ( length times width of the neighborhood of the curve ) .",
    "but @xmath53 is contained in the union of @xmath0 disks of radius @xmath55 and with total area at most @xmath65 , so there is room for no more than @xmath66 iterations in each @xmath53 ( always up to bounded factors ) . in the worst case , when there are multiple or near - multiple roots , we will show that we need to consider @xmath67 , hence a total of @xmath68 iterations is required .",
    "if the roots are well separated from each other , for instance if they are randomly distributed , it turns out that @xmath69 will usually suffice until the domain of quadratic convergence is reached where @xmath70 further iterations yield precision @xmath2 , so we need @xmath71 iterations .",
    "all these count the number of iterations required to find a single root .",
    "but since all roots are competing for the area , the number of iterations to find _ all _ roots satisfies the same bounds ( except that the small @xmath70 term acquires a factor @xmath0 ) .",
    "of course , all these estimates have to be made precise , and we have to make sure that the domains of area do no overlap .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : r - centralorbits ] we introduce _ @xmath52-central orbits _ : these are orbits that never leave the disk @xmath50 , and we give an existence criterion for such orbits . in section  [ sec : goodstartingpoints ] , we construct an explicit finite set of starting points that contains , for each root , at least one @xmath52-central orbit @xmath49 with @xmath72 as required . in section  [ sec : areaperiteration ] we estimate the area needed per single iteration step . in section  [ sec : areaorbit ] , we patch this together and estimate the area needed for each orbit : the main point is to make sure that the pieces of area assigned to each orbit point are disjoint ; this will introduce another factor @xmath6 .",
    "it remains to discuss when to stop the newton iteration .",
    "if the roots are well - separated from each other , then the iteration reaches the domain of quadratic convergence , and the necessary stopping criterion will be given in section  [ sec : stoppingcriterion ] .",
    "we then bring all arguments together and describe the required number of iterations for `` good '' starting points .",
    "the worst case of roots that are not well separated , or possibly even multiple , is treated in section  [ sec : worstcase ] .    in appendix",
