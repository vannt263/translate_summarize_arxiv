    "as well preserved , ancient relics of the chemistry present at the formation stage of the outer solar system , comets provide one of the most valuable tools available for understanding the formation processes and conditions extant when the planets formed , @xmath24.5 gyr ago @xcite .    among the most long - standing observational goals for understanding cometary origins",
    "has been the search for cometary noble gases .",
    "owing to their combination of high volatility and disaffinity to chemical reactions , noble gases provide a key diagnostic to the thermal history of cometary ices .",
    "more specifically , the members of the he , ne , ar , kr sequence display successively higher sublimation temperatures ; as such , they provide a series of thermometers that can be exploited to constrain the thermal history , and therefore the sites of cometary origins .",
    "although the interpretation of noble gas abundances in cometary comae is complicated by the details of their trapping and release efficiencies in cometary ice @xcite , their detection has nonetheless been highly desired .",
    "unfortunately , however , although significant upper limits revealing he depletions of @xmath310@xmath4 in comet austin @xcite and ne depletions of @xmath325 in comet hale - bopp @xcite have been obtained , no detection of any cometary noble gas emmanating from within a comet has previously been obtained .    he , ne , ar , and kr each have resonance transitions in the far and extreme ultraviolet . among the noble gases ,",
    "argon offers a particularly good combination of comparatively high cosmogonic abundance , moderate sublimation temperature , and good uv resonance fluorescence efficiency ; together these properties suggested some time ago @xcite that argon may be the easiest noble gas to detect in comets .",
    "we took advantage of the apparition of the unusually active and bright comet c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) in order to conduct a new and more sensitive search for argon in comets .",
    "with the objectives of ( i ) obtaining a general survey spectrum of hale - bopp in the euv near its perihelion , and ( ii ) making a more sensitive search for argon than had previously been attempted for any comet , we launched the euvs sounding rocket telescope / spectrometer payload on a suborbital mission timed to coincide with the comet s perihelion .",
    "this timing also corresponded closely to the epoch of hale - bopp s peak in activity .",
    "the 184 kg euvs payload @xcite consists of a 40-cm diameter grazing incidence telescope , a long slit rowland circle spectrograph , and its accompanying ranicon 2-d microchannel plate detector , power system , and telemetry electronics .",
    "the telescope is a diamond - turned f/15 wolter type ii grazing incidence design , with a 30-cm aperture @xcite .",
    "the primary mirror is ni coated ; the secondary is sic coated .",
    "for the hale - bopp flight , euvs was configured to study the bandpass from 8201100  ; the characteristic effective area of the instrument in this bandpass is 0.5 @xmath5 .",
    "euvs was launched to observe hale - bopp on a nasa black brant ix sounding rocket from white sands , new mexico , at 03:25 ut on 30 mar 1997 . at this time",
    "hale - bopp was less than 48 hours from perihelion , with a geocentric distance of @xmath6=1.34 au , a heliocentric distance of @xmath7=0.915 au , and a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath8=1.20 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the launch occurred in darkness , with the sun and the comet 116 deg and 76.1 deg from the zenith , respectively .",
    "the launch vehicle performed nominally , lifting the instrument to a peak altitude of 314 km . during",
    "the flight euvs remained in the earth s shadow at all times ; the line of sight to the comet remained above local horizontal .",
    "these two factors effectively eliminated telluric dayglow emissions from the spectra that euvs obtained .",
    "the data we describe below were obtained during the 195 sec period when the payload was above 200 km , where telluric absorption of the euv is also negligible @xcite .",
    "euvs successfully obtained spectra to survey hale - bopp in the euv bandpass using both its 130@xmath1038.6 arcsec ( 12.5  ) medium resolution euvs ( mres ) and 130x6.4 arcsec high resolution ( 2  ) euvs ( hres ) slits ; the centers of these two slits are located 130 arcsec apart .",
    "based on count rate measurements received in real time as telemetry , we elected to maximize snr at the expense of spectral resolution and place the center of brightness of hale - bopp s coma in the mres ; the adjacent hres slit was therefore located some 1.27@xmath1010@xmath11 km away , along the tail axis of the comet .",
    "the euvs hale - bopp dataset contains both strong h ly @xmath0 , and the first ever spectroscopic detections of other neutral h and o features in the euv , cometary o@xmath1 , and cometary argon @xcite . in this letter , we concentrate on the 9501100   portion of the euvs data ( see figure 1 ) in order to focus on the evidence for , and implications of , ar in hale - bopp ; a future publication will discuss the other emissions in the euvs hale - bopp dataset .",
    "the euvs wavelength scale was established by a least - squares fit to a series of pt - lamp lines imaged onto the detector before and after the flight ; these pre- and post - flight wavelength calibrations concurred to within 3  . during data reduction , accurate co - registration of the wavelength",
    "scales for the mres and hres data was achieved using the centroid of the prominent 1025.7   lyman @xmath0 emission line in hale - bopp .",
    "the effective area of euvs was calibrated in flight as a function of wavelength using the uv - bright b0.5 iv star , @xmath12 per .",
    "a post - flight laboratory effective area calibration was also obtained , using an o@xmath1/ar resonance source at five wavelengths across the euvs bandpass .",
    "the two calibrations are in good ( @xmath1335% ) agreement .    using the effective area of the instrument and the solid angle of the slit(s )",
    ", we converted the hale - bopp raw counts spectra to the brightness spectra shown in figure 1 .",
    "the brightness error bars shown in figure 1 were computed at each plotted wavelength from the standard deviation of the mean of the uncertainties due to counting statistics ( including the term due to the nominal background subtraction ) , but neglect the systematic uncertainty in effective area ; errors due to ephemeris and pointing geometry uncertainties ( @xmath141 deg ) are completely negligible .",
    "the mres data in figure 1 reveals what we believe are the 1048 and 1066   ari features blended together just redward of the far stronger , 1026   hi / oi blend .",
    "additional emissions are seen between 975990   and 10801097  .",
    "although these emissions are clearly statistically significant , their identification is not presently secure ; therefore , the analysis of these emissions and the marginally optically thick h ly @xmath0 signal euvs detected will be discussed in a second publication .",
    "regarding the latter , here we simply note that the lyman @xmath0 feature is blended with a contribution from an oi [ 3d@xmath15d@xmath16@xmath172s@xmath182p@xmath4 @xmath15p@xmath19 triplet at 1025.7 , 1027.4 , and 1028.7  , which , owing to radiative pumping by ly @xmath0 , is difficult to precisely model , but which to first order contributes @xmath315 r ; the telluric background ly@xmath0 brightness is estimated to contribute some 20 r above the background .",
    "sky background spectra obtained while euvs was maneuvering toward hale - bopp contain only a weak instrumental background and h i ly @xmath0 emission generated by a combination of geocoronal and interplanetary medium hydrogen .",
    "the fact that no other features are present in euvs sky background spectra , combined with the observing altitude and geometry discussed above , virtually eliminates the possibility of the features seen at hale - bopp as being due to telluric contamination .",
    "returning now to the main subject of this paper , additional evidence for the ar identification comes in three forms .",
    "first , the width of the mres feature extending from 10451070   is consistent with a pair of blended lines 19   apart ( such as the two ar lines ) .",
    "second , the sense of the asymmetry seen in the 10451070   emission is consistent with the fact that the 1048   line s resonance fluorescence efficiency in sunlight ( i.e. , its g - factor ) is 2.4 times higher than the 1066   line s .",
    "third , as shown in the righthand panel of figure 1 , there is also both clear evidence for a 1048   ar feature ( present some 3.2 @xmath20 above the local background ) and an hint of the 1066   feature in the higher - resolution hres data , thereby all but eliminating pathological detection cases ( e.g. , due to flat field effects or count statistics variations ) of the ar features in the main slit .",
    "since the mres data has considerably better count levels than the hres data , we used our line detection software to retrieve individual , background - subtracted gaussians ( with widths established from calibration line sources ) for the two suspected mres dataset argon features .",
    "this software , which obtains best fit wavelengths and integrated brightnesses gaussians for features detected above a specified background , retrieved brightnesses and statistical error bars of 24@xmath138 r centered at 1049  , and 12@xmath21 r at 1066   ( 1 r=10@xmath22 ph @xmath23 s@xmath9 emitted into 4@xmath24 sr ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the 2.0@xmath130.6 ratio of these two retrieved brightnesses corresponds well ( within our statistics ) to the 2.4:1 value predicted by their g - factors , and line formation theory for optically thin emission .",
    "in order to interpret the ar emissions , we first converted the signal brightness @xmath25 in rayleighs into a slit - average column density @xmath26 along the line of sight for each ar line.37,600@xmath10126,600 km .",
    "the ar photoionization scale length at 0.915 au ( @xmath22.7@xmath1010@xmath27 km ) is large compared to the euvs slit . ]",
    "the conversion to column densities in the slit was performed according to the optically thin approximation : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the brightness of line @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the photon fluorescence rate ( i.e. , ph s@xmath9 ) of that emission at the comet .",
    "we adopted resonance fluorescence efficiencies at 1 au of 5.3@xmath1010@xmath32 s@xmath9 and 2.2@xmath1010@xmath32 s@xmath9 for the 1048 and 1066   lines ( after adjustment for the variation in solar fuv using the daily f10.7 solar flux index at the time of our flight ) ; these g - values ( derived from @xcite were then adjusted to reflect hale - bopp s 0.915 au heliocentric distance .    to derive an ar production rate ( @xmath33 )",
    ", we constructed a simple model of the coma s ar distribution , assuming a spherically symmetric , steady - state radial outflow diverging from a point source . to calculate q@xmath34",
    ", we assumed an argon outflow velocity in equilibrium with the h@xmath35o outflow , i.e. , @xmath36=1.25 km s@xmath9 at 0.915 au .",
    "based on the mres slit brightnesses ( and counting+background brightness errors ) of the two argon lines , an error - weighted average ar production rate of 1.1@xmath130.3@xmath1010@xmath37 s@xmath9 , was derived .    to interpret the physical meaning of the euvs ar production rate obtained above",
    ", we ratio the derived ar production rates to the o production rate of the comet .",
    "h@xmath35o is the dominant o - bearing molecule in cometary ices , so we derived the o production rate @xmath38 on the established 1.1@xmath1010@xmath39 s@xmath9 perihelion h@xmath35o production rate @xcite . to account for the oxygen in other o - bearing species ( co , co@xmath35 , chons , sio@xmath40 ) when deriving the ar production ratio [ ar / o ] , we adopt @xmath41 ( based on giotto nms data adjusted for the higher co abundance of hale - bopp ; w.  huebner , pers .  comm . ) .",
    "based on this and the @xmath33 estimate given above , we thus derive an estimate of [ ar / o]=0.0058@xmath130.0017 in hale - bopp s coma . in what follows",
    "we assume that this ratio of production rates is indicative of the coma s ar / o abundance ratio . the most recent cosmogonic ( i.e. , solar ) [ ar / o ] abundance ratio gives [ ar / o]@xmath42=0.00372 @xcite .",
    "figure 2 presents the derived correspondence between the error - weighted average brightness @xmath25 of the two ar lines , and the quantity @xmath33/@xmath38 , ratioed to its cosmogonic value .",
    "although we recognize the difficulty of connecting coma to nuclear abundances with precision because one does not at present know exactly how gases are stored in the nucleus , we interpret our results at their face value : hale - bopp s coma appears to be enriched in ar relative to cosmogonic proportions by 1.8@xmath130.5:1 .",
    "however , we must note that the error estimate given here derives purely from the euvs mres counting statistics . our effective area calibration uncertainty ( 35% ) could reduce this ratio to @xmath21.2 , but it is equally likely to increase the ratio to 2.4 ; so too , there is a dispersion in the various hale - bopp @xmath43 measurements at perihelion of 20% , which could reduce this ratio to @xmath21.4 , but it is equally likely to increase the ratio to 2.2 , and a quoted 16% uncertainty in the solar ar / o ratio @xcite . adding _ all _ of these errors in quadrature",
    ", we find hale - bopp s coma appears to have an ar / o ratio relative to cosmogonic proportions that is 1.8@xmath130.96:1 .    because noble gases by their nature do not participate in either the cometary ice chemistry or coma chemistry , noble gases are parent species in the coma , and their abundance in the neutral coma should reflect their bulk abundance within the cometary nucleus .",
    "we assume this is the case in what follows .",
    "the lack of depletion of hale - bopp s ar relative to cosmogonic proportions is interesting in several respects .",
    "the first of these concerns the thermal history of hale - bopp itself .",
    "the fact that ar is not depleted in hale - bopp indicates that the deep interior of hale - bopp s nucleus can not have ever reached equilibrium temperatures of perhaps 3540 k , else the ar would have been lost to sublimation @xcite .",
    "neon , which is even more volatile than argon , sublimates vigorously at temperatures of 1620 k. the euve satellite returned spectra of hale - bopp in 1996 showing ne is @xmath1725 times depleted relative to cosmogonic proportions @xcite ; this is strong evidence that hale - bopp s deep interior _ has _",
    "been warmed above 20 k.    together , the euve satellite and euvs rocket experiment results trap hale - bopp s bulk internal temperature as having exceeded the ne sublimation loss range of 1620 k , but not the ar sublimation range of approximately 3540 k. these temperature constraints are consistent with others hale - bopp retrieved from h@xmath35o ortho - para @xcite and d / h ratios @xcite .",
    "we interpret our result as indicating that either the solar nebula was far colder and far richer in ar than models typically predict @xcite , or that hale - bopp was formed in the cold , kuiper belt region ( i.e. , well beyond the 2030 au uranus - neptune zone ) and was then subsequently ejected to the oort cloud ( its more recent dynamical home ) without ever spending much time in the ( warmer ) jupiter - saturn zone , or both .",
    "although either implication is contrary to `` conventional wisdom , ''",
    "we note that the transport of comets from the kuiper belt region ( usually after neptune - induced inward evolution ) to the oort cloud has been detected in recent dynamical simulations of oort cloud formation.@xcite .",
    "this first detection of a native cometary noble gas , argon , whets our appetite for more measurements , in order to assess how typical hale - bopp is in its ar abundance .",
    "we also look forward to detection of other noble gases in comets , particularly ne and kr , and to the eventual determination of whether the ices within individual comets contain varying proportions of ar and other chemically inert tracers as a guide to understanding the heterogeneity vs.  homogeneity of material within cometary nuclei , and therefore better still understanding their origins .",
