    "the enormous progress in experimental and theoretical studies of ultracold quantum gases leads to a much deeper understanding of quantum many body physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , bose - einstein condensation in traps enables us to investigate profoundly quantum statistical phenomena in finite systems . in more recent experiments ,",
    "spatial and temporal coherences @xcite of ultracold bose gases are investigated in terms of correlation functions .",
    "moreover , dynamics from nonequilibrium to equilibrium states @xcite and the spatial dependence of equilibrium density fluctuations @xcite are considered . for a theoretical description of these phenomena",
    "it is desirable to consider nonzero temperature , finite size and  as no particle bath is present  a canonical description of the many - body quantum system . for most experiments ,",
    "interaction between the atoms are of crucial importance . in systems with a feshbach resonance ,",
    "the interaction strength may even be tuned over a wide range  allowing to study ideal gases , too . in this article",
    "we deal almost exclusively with an ideal gas and comment on the interacting case briefly at the end of our paper .",
    "it is clear that many properties of ultracold gases are sensitive to temperature not least due to the different size of the condensed fraction of the gas .",
    "moreover , for these finite systems with a fixed number of particles , it is preferable to base a theoretical description on the canonical ensemble rather than the usual grand canonical ensemble . for an ideal gas ,",
    "the best known example for the significance to choose the canonical ensemble is the fluctuation of the ground state occupation number @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "clearly , it approaches zero as temperature tends to zero in a canonical ensemble .",
    "yet it is of the size of the average particle number @xmath2 in a grand canonical description . a detailed study of the fluctuations of the ground state particle number in the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles are given in @xcite .",
    "spatial correlations are among other quantities of relevance for which a grand canonical formulation differs significantly from a canonical description @xcite .",
    "recently , we presented a norm preserving stochastic field equation that describes the canonical state of an ideal bose gas @xcite .",
    "the resulting equation fully reflects quantum statistics and was given in @xcite in a representation independent form .",
    "therefore , it can be propagated in position space , meaning that it is not necessary to know eigenfunctions and -energies of the trapped atoms .",
    "while in @xcite we simply state the equation and display a few applications , we here want to elaborate on its derivation , its numerical implementation and further applications in much more detail .    as we will show , spatial correlations and fluctuations can easily be calculated in position space . due to the quantum framework , the equation  despite representing a c - number field ",
    "does not suffer from any cutoff problems which usually occur for classical field equations .",
    "thus , numerical simulations can be performed with sufficient precision and reasonable effort .",
    "let us relate our approach to previous stochastic equations for the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "note that most of these investigations are concerned with an interacting gas , while here , as a first step , we restrict ourselves to the case of the ideal gas . since our theory can be formulated in position space , we clearly expect to be able to include interactions in a mean field sense in a next step .",
    "detailed discussions of different approaches to ( interacting ) ultracold gases in terms of stochastic field equations are given in @xcite .",
    "exact methods based on the positive p - representation of the full density operator are used by drummond and co - workers @xcite .",
    "this theory brings about numerical challenges and is applied mainly to one - dimensional systems .",
    "more recently , also a 3d free gas at temperatures well below the transition temperature has been discussed @xcite .",
    "other approaches @xcite can be seen as classical field methods , in which the lowly occupied energy levels must be treated in a different formalism or neglected , due to ultraviolet problems .",
    "davis and co - workers apply a projection on a subspace of highly occupied energy levels , using a cutoff @xcite , while gardiner and co - workers separate the field operator in a highly and lowly occupied part @xcite .",
    "we see our approach more in the spirit of stoof and co - worker , who start from a path integral approach and arrive at a functional fokker - planck equation for the wigner functional of the thermal field @xcite .",
    "after additional simplifications , in their work the corresponding langevin equation takes the form of a classical stochastic field equation as given by hohenberg and halperin @xcite .    apart from these grand canonical approaches , theories for a fixed particle number have also been presented more recently @xcite .",
    "xu and co - workers describe bose gases with first order perturbation theory and in a bogoliubov approximation @xcite . an exact phase - space description for a finite number of particles is worked out by korsch and co - workers .",
    "exact evolution equations for the husimi - q- and the glauber - sudarshan - p - distribution function based on a bose - hubbard hamiltonian are derived @xcite .",
    "stochastic methods in phase - space for the canonical ensemble of qubit and spin models have been presented by drummond and co - workers @xcite . while all these theories based on a canonical ensemble focus on different systems , e.g. lattices or spin models , we here aim to describe the full canonical thermal state of a bose gas in any given trap .",
    "our novel equation presented in @xcite has been found on the basis of the glauber - sudarshan - p - representation  being exact for an ideal gas . in this paper",
    "we aim to explain in more detail the derivation of the equation , its properties , its numerical implementation , and we show its power by discussing further applications .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the second section we show the theoretical background and the derivation of the stochastic field equation .",
    "the third section is devoted to the discussion of some crucial properties of the equation . in the fourth section",
    "we demonstrate how we propagate the equation in energy and in position space numerically .",
    "results of these numerical applications are shown in the fifth section , before we draw conclusions in the final section .",
    "in order to derive a quantum stochastic field equation for the canonical ensemble of an ideal bose gas , our first aim is to express quantum expectation values for a fixed particle number in terms of c - number integrals .",
    "the desired stochastic field equation should enable us to calculate these expectation values .",
    "we use the corresponding fokker - planck equation to demonstrate the equivalence of stochastic and canonical quantum ensemble mean .",
    "we begin with the canonical density operator for @xmath2 particles @xmath3 as usual , the hamiltonian @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of occupation numbers of single - particle states ( @xmath5 denotes the energy of single - particle state @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the canonical partition function is denoted by @xmath7 , with the usual @xmath8 incorporating boltzmann s constant @xmath6 and temperature @xmath9 .",
    "crucially , a projector @xmath10 on the @xmath2-particle subspace appears , with the usual number states @xmath11 .",
    "the operator @xmath12 projects the exponential @xmath13 on a subspace of @xmath2 particles . in order to arrive at a c - number representation of quantum expectation values",
    ", one can express @xmath13 from ( [ density ] ) as a mixture of coherent states using the ( glauber - sudarshan ) p - function representation @xcite @xmath14 here , we abbreviate the normalization factor with @xmath15 , and products of coherent states with @xmath16 .",
    "the appropriate measure is @xmath17 .    of particular interest",
    "are correlation functions of quantum field operators . using the p - representation ( [ p - function ] )",
    ", we can determine canonical quantum expectation values with the help of @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) and obtain a weight function @xmath19 .",
    "with the latter , quantum expectation values can be written as integrals over c - numbers , @xmath20 with @xmath21 .    in this work",
    "we focus on spatial correlation functions .",
    "therefore , we are interested in ensemble averages for the bosonic field operator @xmath22 with @xmath23 the single - particle eigenstate corresponding to energy @xmath5 . first , the weight function is rewritten as @xmath24 using @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "further , we obtain @xmath27 with the normalisation constant @xmath28 . it should be mentioned here that for quantum expectation values of second ( or higher ) order one has to use weight functions of different @xmath2 . for @xmath29 , for instance",
    ", the first order @xmath30 has to be replaced by @xmath31  for higher orders the result changes accordingly ( k - th order : chose @xmath32 ) .    in order to calculate these expectation values we were able to construct a new , norm - preserving stochastic field equation @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of quantum statistical and stochastic ensemble mean is based on the fact that the weight functions @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) turn out to be stationary solutions of the corresponding fokker - planck equation .    in representation",
    "independent form ( @xmath35 ) and using stratonovich calculus @xcite it reads ( @xmath36 throughout ) @xmath37 here , the single particle hamiltonian @xmath38 appears , and a damping parameter @xmath39 .",
    "crucially , temperature enters through an _ operator _",
    "@xmath40 the noise increment @xmath41 is uncorrelated in space and time @xmath42 .",
    "equation ( [ quantumequation ] ) is a norm preserving , non - linear stochastic equation that enables us to obtain canonical expectation values on average .",
    "it is important to stress that the dependence of the stochastic fields @xmath43 on the particle number @xmath2 is indirectly given through their norm @xmath44 which is preserved during propagation and thus determined by the initial condition .",
    "one might expect @xmath45 to be a reasonable choice ; however , matters are more delicate and a distribution of norms @xmath46 is required in order to obtain exact quantum expectation values .",
    "we devote the whole next section [ norm ] to the relation between norm @xmath46 and particle number @xmath2 .    sometimes it useful to express ( [ quantumequation ] ) as an ito - stochastic equation ,",
    "reading @xmath47    the novel stochastic field equation can be easily solved numerically and used in different representations .",
    "an implementation in the position representation is particularly useful as it can be applied to arbitrary external potentials @xmath48 .",
    "based on the assumption of sufficient ergodicity , in applications the ensemble averages are replaced by a long time limit @xmath49 over a single realization @xmath50 of the stochastic field equation .",
    "the term @xmath51 consists of a phenomenological damping term @xmath39 , while `` @xmath52 '' describes `` real '' dynamics .",
    "so , in a phenomenological manner , our equation can also be used to mimic the transition from a non - equilibrium to an equilibrium state .",
    "it is important to point out the crucial role of the operator @xmath53 .",
    "its meaning becomes most apparent when we omit the nonlinear terms in our equation ( [ quantumequation ] ) and think of @xmath54 to represent @xmath55 which also affects the operator @xmath53 .",
    "one obtains an equation which gives us the thermal state of the grand canonical ensemble @xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 the chemical potential used to fix the average particle number @xmath2 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the canonical equation ( [ quantumequation ] ) is not merely a normalized version of the grand canonical equation .",
    "the linear equation ( [ quantumgc ] ) is closely related to the classical field equation for the thermal state of the grand canonical ensemble for any hamiltonian energy functional @xmath58 @xcite @xmath59 which has well - known ultraviolet problems .",
    "if one sets @xmath60 , there is only one difference between classical ( [ classicalgc ] ) and quantum equation ( [ quantumgc ] ) : the classical temperature @xmath61 is substituted by the operator @xmath53 . as discussed in @xcite , for instance , the classical equation satisfies the equipartition theorem and therefore the infinite degrees of freedom of a field @xmath62 lead to an ultraviolet catastrophe .",
    "this can also be seen in equ .",
    "( [ classicalgc ] ) looking at a formulation in position space : the white noise term which is uncorrelated in position induces arbitrarily high momentum kicks",
    ". however , if we consider the operator @xmath63 acting on the white noise @xmath41 in position space representation , the former white noise becomes spatially correlated , and we no longer get unphysical momentum .",
    "in other words , proper quantum statistics requires the replacement of spatially uncorrelated noise @xmath64 in ( [ classicalgc ] ) by spatially correlated effective noise @xmath65 , as in ( [ quantumgc ] ) .",
    "the correlation function of the effective noise @xmath66 is now a smooth function in position space and shown in fig .",
    "[ b1 ] for two different temperatures .    in the low energy limit @xmath67 , indeed",
    ", the operator tends to the classical temperature @xmath68 . yet in the case of high energies @xmath69 , the operator tends to zero @xmath70 .",
    "we see that in the quantum equations ( [ quantumequation ] , [ quantumgc ] ) the required cutoff is built in .",
    "in this chapter we want to investigate the relationship between quantum expectation values of arbitrary order @xmath71 ( [ ensembleaverage ] ) and those obtained with the stochastic field equation ( sfe ) @xmath72 . for the following",
    "we introduce the norm @xmath73 of the wavefunction .",
    "the stochastic equation keeps the norm fixed , while the integral of the quantum expectation values ( [ ensembleaverage ] ) extends over a range of values of the quantity @xmath74 .",
    "the norm stays constant and for any stochastic method @xmath75 .",
    "hence , we can write the first order expectation values we obtain from the stochastic equation as @xmath76 we find that this expression depends on the ground state energy @xmath77 .",
    "it can be seen easily by a substitution @xmath78 that the simple identity @xmath79 holds .",
    "the relation between the average values given by the stochastic field equation and quantum expectation values is now obvious @xmath80 with the norm distribution @xmath81 in the integral ( [ sfeqm ] ) .",
    "+ note that @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , and in order to get a better understanding of equ .",
    "( [ sfeqm ] ) , we have to investigate @xmath83 more closely .",
    "a lengthy calculation is given in appendix [ a1 ] , which results in    @xmath84    with @xmath85 .",
    "well below the critical temperature it is sufficient to consider only the first term of the sum @xmath86 because the remaining terms are smaller by a factor @xmath87 .",
    "numerical investigations of the factors @xmath88 showed that this approximation is justified in the temperature region considered here .",
    "then our distribution @xmath89 is normalized to @xmath90 within this approximation we have a poisson - like distribution @xmath91 this distribution is centered around @xmath92 and the standard deviation equals @xmath93 . for large",
    "@xmath2 the ratio of variance and mean goes to zero @xmath94 .",
    "hence , in general it is sufficient to propagate equ .",
    "( [ quantumequation ] ) with a single norm , i.e. we replace @xmath95 . as a consequence , from ( [ sfeqm ] ) we get the simple relation @xmath96 between canonical quantum correlation function and ensemble average of the stochastic field equation . as further elaborated upon in section [ results ] , it is for very high precision only , that it is necessary to take into account the full norm distribution .",
    "let us also remark that for higher order expectation values these considerations apply similarly .",
    "it should be noted here that if the norm of our numerical simulation of the stochastic field equation @xmath46 should correspond to the particle number @xmath2 , we have to choose @xmath97 .",
    "however , it is also possible to choose a norm different from the particle number according to ( [ normnumber ] ) .",
    "this freedom is useful for an easier numerical implementation , as shown in section [ ni ] .",
    "it should also be mentioned that for temperatures above and near the critical temperature , the approximations leading to expression ( [ averagenorm ] ) are no longer valid and the exact norm distribution needs to be known . still , using ( [ averagenorm ] ) , for many quantities we observe satisfying results even in this temperature region .",
    "in this section it is shown how one can solve the novel stochastic field equation numerically .",
    "the implementations can be done in different representations , whichever is convenient for a given trap potential . if the single particle eigenenergies are known ( recall that we neglect interatomic interactions here ) a propagation in energy space is the easiest way to solve our equation . in a box potential",
    "this is analogous to a propagation in momentum space . for a trap potential @xmath48 with unknown energy spectrum",
    ", one can solve the equation in position space directly , using a split operator method based on fast fourier transformation .",
    "this implementation is more challenging but the program can be easily adjusted to any trap just by changing the single line of code where the potential is defined .",
    "if the eigenvalues for the given trap potential are known , a numerical implementation in energy space does not contain any challenging aspects . as already explained above",
    ", it is more convenient to pass to position space , if we want to solve problems with arbitrary external potential , for which the eigenenergies are not known .",
    "we turn to a discretized formulation of equation ( [ quantumequationito ] ) and use a position grid @xmath98 with some multi - index @xmath52 .",
    "the part of the equation containing the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath99 only can be propagated easily using standard fast - fourier transformation methods @xcite .",
    "the challenging aspect is the evaluation of matrix elements of the operator ( [ koperator ] ) appearing in ( [ quantumequationito ] ) , i.e. the determination of @xmath100 .    for an efficient implementation",
    "a wigner - weyl - approximation is helpful .",
    "the wigner - weyl correspondence @xcite of the operator @xmath53 in @xmath101-dimensional phase space is defined as @xmath102 with the help of which we can obtain the matrix elements as @xmath103 in order to simplify , we consider only zeroth order in @xmath104 , and find the classical expression @xmath105 this approximation will be justified by comparing the approximated numerical result with exact numerical calculations .    expanding the denominator in a geometric series we get @xmath106    the momentum - integration can now be carried out without any difficulty which leads to the following expression : @xmath107    it is important to note that the convergence of the geometric series in ( [ beginnoise ] ) very much depends on the minimum of the potential energy .",
    "indeed , rapid convergence can be assured by adding some ( physically irrelevant ) constant to @xmath48 . however , as this shift also affects the ground state energy @xmath77 , it also has a significant influence on the norm distribution of the wave function as can be witnessed in ( [ normnumber ] ) .",
    "therefore , in practice one tries to identify some optimal shift that assures both , rapid convergence and a reasonable norm of the wave function .",

    "( [ correlation ] ) .",
    "now , in order to propagate equ .",
    "( [ quantumequationito ] ) , it is necessary to think about the numerical implementation of the correlated noise @xmath65 , too . obviously , the ( discretized ) noise @xmath109 must be generated in a way that @xmath110 holds . in order to find an efficient way to obtain the noise , we start with equ .",

    "the strategy follows the very same lines .",

    "( [ spherical ] ) can be evaluated by a monte - carlo integration using three additional real gaussian random numbers @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we arrive at the following representation of the correlation function as an average over four normally distributed real random variables @xmath121 : @xmath122 to proceed further we make use of the observation that the correlation function is very much concentrated along the diagonal @xmath123 ( see figs .",
    "[ b1],[b2 ] ) . based on this fact , we approximate @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , in order to achieve a factorization of the @xmath126-dependence on the right - hand - side in equ .",
    "( [ factor1 ] ) .",
    "the final step is the introduction of a family of independent complex wiener increments @xmath127 ( with @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) , i.e. @xmath130 . with their help",
    "we achieve an explicit expression for the correlated noise in terms of independent gaussian ( @xmath131 ) and wiener ( @xmath132 ) random variables , @xmath133 the good agreement of the correlation function of the noise in wigner - weyl approximation from ( [ noisewignerweyl ] ) and the exact correlation function can be seen in fig .",
    "[ b2 ] , where we show on the left an average over numerical realisations from ( [ noisewignerweyl ] ) and on the right the exact correlation function @xmath108 for an isotropic harmonic oscillator at @xmath134 .    to summarize this section",

    "the other terms of the equation can be propagated using fast - fourier transformation .",

    "the results are obtained in energy or position representation .",
    "the applicability of our equation is first shown by determining the wigner function @xmath136 of a bose gas .",
    "the propagation itself is performed in 3d position space , the figures show the wigner function integrated over the remaining four phase space coordinates .",
