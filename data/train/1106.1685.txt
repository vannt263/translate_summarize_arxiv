    "we consider two symmetry groups for the normal state which will serve to define the fflo / pdw order .",

    ", our development and emphasis will be on the group @xmath14 and we will state results for the case with cylindrical symmetry . for fflo / pdw order appearing at a wavevector @xmath15 , the order parameter is defined by the irreducible representations of @xmath16 ( the set of rotation elements that conserve @xmath15 ) and the star of the wavevector @xmath15 in @xmath14 ( set of wavevectors symmetrically equivalent to @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "we choose the wavevector @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is fflo / pdw lattice constant ) , which is invariant under the rotation group @xmath19 with @xmath20 the @xmath21-rotation around the axis @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the mirror operations perpendicular to the 2d plane and the plane perpendicular to @xmath22 , respectively . the irreducible representations of @xmath16 are all one - dimensional .",
    "the only situation in which the particular irreducible representation of @xmath16 is relevant is when there is a spatially uniform @xmath25 superfluid order also present ( for example , corresponding to usual cooper pairs ) @xcite .",
    "this situation can be accounted for easily and , for this reason , we consider explicitly the identity representation in the following ( for which the order parameter is unchanged under the action of any element of @xmath16 ) . to define the additional order parameter components at the wavevectors in the star of @xmath15 we use the elements @xmath26 ,",
    "these give the star of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , as shown in fig .",
    "this then defines a superconducting order parameter with six complex components which we define as @xmath29 .",
    "we take @xmath30 , @xmath17 , and @xmath31 so that the superfluid order is unchanged by the translations @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( note that these are _ not _ translation vectors of the underlying microscopic triangular lattice ) .",
    "we consider the case that these translations vectors are not commensurate with the translation vectors of the underlying microscopic triangular lattice ( as is the usual case with fflo phases ) . with these definitions ,",
    "the symmetry properties of the order parameter are given as follows : under a microscopic translation @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and under a time - reversal operation @xmath37 . moreover , under point group symmetries we have that @xmath38 transforms to @xmath39    = 2.5 in    the glw free energy is constructed by requiring invariance under the group @xmath14 , @xmath40 gauge symmetry ( under which @xmath41 ) , and time - reversal symmetry .",

    "consequently , in the following , we concentrate on the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the state described by @xmath49 is a superfluid triangular lattice ( this state is closely related to @xmath51 , which is a superfluid honeycomb lattice without any vortices ) .",

    "an important feature is the existence of defects that contain both fractional vortex charge and fractional dislocation charge . in the case of the stripe - like",
    "pdw and fflo phases , the predicted @xmath11 vortices play a central role in determining the phase diagram @xcite .",

    "this latter result is somewhat surprising given the prevalence of fractional vortices in other fflo / pdw ground states and is a direct consequence of the co - existence of the spatially uniform charge two @xmath70-wave superfluid with the fflo / pdw order .",

    "[ rgh ] , it is useful consider initially the first rg equation ( for @xmath92 ) .",
    "this rg equation arises due to screening of single vortices .",
    "these vortices can be screened by other single vortices and by the one - third vortices .",
    "the interaction between single vortices is given by @xmath92 , while that between a single vortex and a one - third vortex is given by @xmath95 .",
    "this leads to the first rg equation ( for @xmath92 ) : the @xmath13 in the new term @xmath96 comes from a factor of @xmath97 ( due to the interaction between a vortex and a one - third vortex ) and a factor of three stemming from the three different possible ways to screen a single vortex with one - third vortices .",
    "the second rg equation follows from a similar consideration for dislocations ( these can be screened by other dislocations and by one - third vortices ) .",
    "the equations determining the fugacities follow from the usual considerations @xcite together with the possibility of combining defects to create a new defect @xcite .",
    "for example , dislocations can be created by pairing either two other dislocations or by pairing two one - third vortices .",
    "these two processes lead to the terms @xmath98 in the fourth rg equation .    for comparison , we write the rg equations for @xmath49 ( these are simply the rg equations of superfluidity @xcite and 2d melting in the isotropic limit @xcite ) , @xmath99 despite starting with the same elastic hamiltonian , the rg equations and the resultant phase diagrams for the two different ground states ( shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) differ substantially .",
    "this is because the state @xmath50 has exotic one - third vortices , while the state @xmath49 does not .",
    "= 3.0 in    for the ground state @xmath49 , the theory is that of uncoupled dislocations and vortices .",
    "vortices proliferate for @xmath100 and dislocations proliferate for @xmath101 . as a consequence ,",
    "the melting of the fflo / pdw phase occurs generally through two separate phase transitions . as temperature is increased , the first transition is either to a conventional superfluid or to a density wave state and the second is to the disordered phase .",
    "an examination of the correlation functions in eq .",
    "[ corr ] reveal that in the fflo / pdw phase either the conventional superfluid order or the density wave order ( and not the fflo / pdw order ) have the longest range correlations , masking the original fflo / pdw order .",
    "indeed , the melting of the fflo / pdw to a density wave state and then to a disordered state represents the same sequence of transitions expected for a conventional supersolid @xcite .",
    "these arguments indicate that @xmath49 strongly resembles a conventional supersolid state .",
    "let us come back to the state @xmath50 .",
    "its phase diagram can be understood qualitatively by considering the terms of eq .",
    "[ rgh ] that are linear in the fugacities . in this limit , vortices proliferate for @xmath100 ( superfluid order is lost ) , dislocations proliferate for @xmath101 ( density wave order is lost ) , and @xmath13 vortices proliferate when @xmath102 ( all order is lost ) .",
    "consequently , in addition to the disordered phase and the fully ordered fflo / pdw phase , there exist two new phases .",
    "the first is an orbital antiferromagnet phase in which there is no superfluid order , however , the density wave order and the orbital order still exhibit power law correlations .",
    "the second phase is a charge six superfluid ( @xmath103 ) that is spatially homogeneous . in this phase",
    "there is no density wave or orbital order .",
    "the qualitative phase diagram for @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( an exact phase diagram requires going beyond the small fugacity limit ) .",
    "the solid lines are the anticipated phases boundaries .",
    "these follow from an argument given in ref .",
    "for the phase diagram of 2d spinor condensates . in the shaded triangular regions of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the phases @xmath104 and the orbital antiferromagnetic phase can not be stable ( a theory linear in fugacities would lead to the opposite conclusion ) .",
    "in particular , even though @xmath102 for the unrenormalized stiffnesses , this is not true for the renormalized stiffnesses .",
    "consequently , 1/3 vortices will proliferate and all quasi - long range order will be lost .",
    "we note that , in principle , there can exist other phases that have not been explicitly considered here .",
    "for example , for rotationally invariant systems , the passage of the density wave phase into the disordered phase can have an intervening hexatic phase @xcite .",
    "similarly , a recent analysis for the lo phase for rotationally invariant systems , leads to an intervening nematic phase @xcite .",
    "the consideration of such phases requires the inclusion of disclinations and related defects which have not been included in this work .",
    "we have presented an analysis of thermal melting on two fflo / pdw ground states with hexagonal symmetry . for a fflo / pdw vortex - antivortex lattice phase",
    ", we find that thermal melting can lead to either a charge six superfluid , an orbital antiferromagnetic , or directly to a disordered phase . while for a fflo / pdw phase with only superfluid density oscillations , thermal melting necessarily proceeds in two transitions : the first to either a density wave phase or a conventional superfluid , and the second transition to a disordered phase .",
