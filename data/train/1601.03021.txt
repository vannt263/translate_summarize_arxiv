    "we constructed the linear time - dependent invariants for the non - degenerated parametric amplifier for the trigonometric and hyperbolic cases .",
    "these invariants are used to determine in analytic form the evolution of two - mode gaussian wave packets , which is always a gaussian state characterized by the covariance matrix in  ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) . also we noted that the evolution of a squeezed vacuum state is also a squeezed vacuum state .",
    "the corresponding tomographic representation of the states was calculated in ( [ 30 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) and plotted in the phase space @xmath17 displaying clearly the presence of the squeezing phenomena .    to calculate the entanglement between the idler and signal modes of the parametric amplifier",
    ", we establish a discretization of the density matrix which , in principle , leads to an infinite matrix full of zeros plus a finite @xmath18 density matrix . by means of this finite matrix ,",
    "we have calculated the linear and von neumann entropies . for the evolution of the vacuum state , we have analytic results for the entropies in eqs .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , which are compared with the results of the discretization for two different values of the squeezing parameter @xmath19 , the mean square deviation is of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding calculations for the coherent and gaussian states are also determined by the discretization procedure . in all the cases",
    ", we have a periodic behavior ( with period @xmath21 ) .",
    "if we want to determine the results for the hyperbolic case of the parametric amplifier , we can do an analytic continuation in the parameters of the model .",
    "we point out that the periodic nature of the entropies is present even when the state is not periodic .",
    "we also have shown that the initial entanglement can be amplified due to the evolution in the parametric amplifier , the maxima values occur at times @xmath22 while the minima values occur at time equal to zero and @xmath23 , @xmath24 .    in this work , we establish another procedure to determine the entanglement of the system , which is based on a qubit portrait of a symplectic ( or optical ) tomogram .",
    "this portrait uses the properties of the stochastic matrices to define a bell - type parameter @xmath25 , which must satisfy the inequality @xmath26 .",
    "the method reduces the continuous probability of the tomogram to a @xmath27 stochastic matrix which must satisfy the previous inequality , if it can be written as a direct product of two stochastic matrices .",
    "this must be done by taking into account carefully the integration regions of the continuous variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have selected several possible partitions to have a violation of the bell - type inequality without success .    for a composite system , the integral for joint probability @xmath30 is equal to the product @xmath31 .",
    "then , one can say that there are no correlations between the measurements of the probabilities in the two - variable system and its state is simply separable .",
    "therefore , one can assume that it is simply separable and define the bell - type parameter @xmath32 for the factorized tomogram , which leads to establish the equality @xmath33 .",
    "this equality is a necessary condition for the system to be separable and a violation of this condition is a sufficient condition to determine the entanglement .",
    "we study also the behavior of another type of correlations by constructing a @xmath27 stochastic matrix without taking into account that the different integration regions can be written as a direct product of two subsystems .    as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bellt ] , when the matrix @xmath34 is multiplied by @xmath35 and a new parameter @xmath25 is defined , one can see that this prameter can take values larger than the cirelson bound .",
    "finally , we want to enhance that the discretization procedure of the density matrix can be expressed as a nonlinear positive mapping to reduce even further the @xmath18 density matrix without losing information on the entanglement of the system as , for example , if it has a large quantity of zeros .",
    "this method is currently explored and it will be presented in a future publication .",
    "the time - dependent invariants are operators @xmath36 that satisfy @xmath37+\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial t}\\ . \\label{a1}\\ ] ] for quadratic hamiltonians , @xmath36 is linear in the annihilation and creation operators  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the parametric amplifier , one proposes an invariant of the form @xmath38 which being substituted into eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) yields a coupled pair of differential equations @xmath39    to solve these sets of coupled differential equations , we consider the transforms @xmath40 and @xmath41 together with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . substituting these expressions into eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) , one arrives at @xmath44 where @xmath45 ; and then @xmath46 whose solution , for the initial conditions @xmath47 , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 with @xmath50 .    noticing that @xmath51 and @xmath52 must satisfy the same differential equations that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , but now for the initial conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , one gets @xmath57 .",
    "if we now consider the initial conditions @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath56 , @xmath48 , one has the same differential equations making the substitutions @xmath60 into eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "substituting properly the previous results , one arrives at expression  ( [ 2 ] ) for the linear time - dependent invariants of the parametric amplifier .",
    "the quadrature operators for the two modes are defined as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , which can be written explicitly using eq .",
