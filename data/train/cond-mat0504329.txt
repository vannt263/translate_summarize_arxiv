    "real networks underlying disease transmission have been recognized to be complex and not approximated by conventional graphs such as lattices , regular trees , or classical random graphs .",
    "not only being complex , many networks have the small - world and scale - free properties @xcite .",
    "an important property of small - world networks is that the distance between a pair of vertices , or the minimum number of edges connecting two vertices , is fairly small on average .",
    "the scale - free property means that the vertex degree @xmath0 , or the number of contacts with other individuals ( vertices ) for a given individual , has a power law distribution : @xmath1 @xcite . typically , @xmath2 ranges between 2 and 3 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the degree is uniform on , for example , the square lattice ( @xmath3 ) .    extending earlier data on heterogeneous sexual contact rates of humans @xcite",

    "epidemic thresholds above which epidemic outbreaks or endemic states ensue scale as @xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath5 is the mean degree , and @xmath6 is the second moment of the degree .",
    "then a heterogeneous population , which has a large @xmath7 in comparison with @xmath8 , yields a smaller epidemic threshold and are more likely to elicit outbreaks .",
    "particularly , scale - free networks with @xmath9 have epidemic thresholds equal to 0 because @xmath7 diverges",
    ". then , disease propagation on a global scale can occur for an arbitrary small infection rate .",
    "this holds for the percolation @xcite , the contact process ( also called the sis model ) that describes endemic diseases such as gonorrhea @xcite , and the sir model that describes single - shot outbreak dynamics such as hiv @xcite .",
    "apart from heterogeneous contact rates , realistic epidemic processes are also more complex than merely described by the percolation , the contact process , or the sir model .",
    "practical epidemic models often have more detailed states corresponding to , for example , exposed , quarantine , and mutated .",
    "accordingly , state - transition rules become more complicated @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to represent the transition rules of an epidemic model by a schematic figure like fig .",
    "[ fig : known ] .",
    "solid lines mean state - transition routes whose event rates are independent of the states of neighbors ( e.g. death , recovery , mutation ) .",
    "dashed lines represent ones whose rates are proportional to the neighbors states ( e.g. reproduction , infection ) . then , the contact process and the sir model are represented by fig .",
    "[ fig : known](a ) and [ fig : known](b ) , respectively .",
    "for example , in the contact process , a susceptible individual ( state 0 ) turns infected ( state 1 ) at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals in the neighborhood @xmath10 .",
    "the infection rate is denoted by @xmath11 , and the spontaneous recovery rate is set equal to unity .",
    "understanding of multi - state contagion models on complex networks may be helpful in combatting real epidemics . in this direction , liu and",
    "coworkers analyzed the sirs model , which has the state of partial immunity r and is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : known](c ) @xcite .",
    "they also studied the household model , in which each vertex has a graded state corresponding to the number of patients in a household @xcite .",
    "they showed that the epidemic thresholds are proportional to @xmath12 also in these models .",
    "however , how general the universality of the @xmath12-scaling is has not been addressed .    in this paper , we analyze various multi - state epidemic processes originally proposed for lattices or populations with homogeneous contact rates .",
    "we concentrate on endemic models in which the phase boundary between the coexistence state , where both susceptible and infected individuals can survive , and the disease - free state with the susceptible individuals only is concerned .",
    "of course , we then disregard the other important class of epidemic models including the sir model , in which possibility of one - shot waves of outbreaks rather than coexistence is concerned ( for this distinction , see @xcite ) . instead of covering both classes , we investigate phase boundaries of endemic models with more than two states and possibly with more than two phases . we show that the critical infection rates are largely extinct as @xmath13",
    ". however , there are a couple of important exceptions to this rule : models with mutation or cyclic interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] , we start with studying two models that follow the @xmath12-scaling . sections  [ sec : two_pathogens ] , [ sec : double ] , [ sec : rock ] , and [ sec : malaria ] are devoted to the analysis of representative models with different characteristics and outcomes . some of them do not follow the @xmath12-scaling .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the following , we investigate various contagion models with different transition rules . because we can never be exhaustive , our strategy is to study known multiple - state models .",
    "it will turn out that the extinction of epidemic thresholds as @xmath14 goes to infinity is not a universal story , as summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . what determines the nature of phase boundaries is considered to be the gross organization of the transition pathways , some of which are independent of the state of the neighbors ( solid lines in figs .  [",

    "* model *    the state - transition rules of the two - stage contact process @xcite are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twostage](a ) .",
    "it differs from the sirs model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : known](c ) ) in that the transition rate from 0 to 1 is proportional to the density of the neighbors with state 2 ( not 1 ) of a state-0 vertex .",
    "this model corresponds to dynamics with two life stages .",
    "the states can be interpreted as 0 : vacant , 1 : occupied by young individuals , and 2 : occupied by adults .",
    "only adults are reproductive and generate offsprings in neighboring vacant sites at a birth rate equal to @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "a birth event occurs at a vacant site at a rate proportional to @xmath11 and the number of neighboring adults .",
    "youngs ( state 1 ) spend random time of mean @xmath15 before becoming adult ( state 2 ) .",
    "they are also subject to random death events at a rate of @xmath16 .",
    "adults die at a rate of 1 , which gives normalization of the entire model .",
    "alternatively , we can interpret the three states as 0 : vacant , 1 : partially occupied , and 2 : fully occupied colonies .",
    "then , only fully occupied colonies are potent enough to colonize vacant lands . in the disease analogue , 0 is susceptible , 1 is infected but in the incubation period ( not infectious ) , and 2 is infected and infectious .",
    "we note that the model corresponds to the seirs model without the recovery state r.    the ordinary contact process ( fig .",

    ", a state-1 vertex immediately turns into state 2 . the meanfield approximation and",
    "the rigorous results on regular lattices conclude that there are two phases : @xmath18 ( the steady state that consists only of state 0 ) and @xmath19 ( positive probability of steady coexistence of 0 , 1 , and 2 ) .",

    "( [ eq : twostage1 ] ) ) is proportional to @xmath30 , which is the average number of state-2 vertices in the neighborhood of a degree-@xmath0 vertex .",
    "when we choose an arbitrary edge , the probability that a specific vertex is connected to this edge is proportional to its degree @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "one is that we have two state - transition routes that depend on neighbors states .",
    "both of them depend on the density of infectious individuals ( state 2 ) .",
    "antoher feature is that disease progression from state 1 to 2 is possible through two parallel routes .",
    "an early - stage patient ( state 1 ) can develop the disease on its own at a rate of @xmath15 .",
    "at the same time , infectious patients ( state 2 ) in the neighborhood increases the possibility of disease progression for a state-1 individual .",

    "coexistence of two distinct diseases in a population also introduces competition between them .    in terms of schematic diagrams",
