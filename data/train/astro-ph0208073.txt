    "one of the key problems in structure formation theories is the issue of the galaxy distribution and the transition to homogeneity and isotropy of the universe in large enough scales .",
    "historically , the hypothesis of homogeneity ( the cosmological principle , cp ) was introduced by einstein to find simple solutions of the field equations for the case where the spatial hypersphere of the universe is a maximally symmetric subspace of the space - time . that allows us to derive the robertson - walker metric and the friedmann equations , the theoretical framework where cosmology has been developed .",
    "at the same time , the cp implies that all mass units should be statistically equivalent , with a poisson distribution in space . in this case",
    ", correlations may appear only on average and should be the same when viewed from any point in the system .",
    "actually , it has been shown that luminous matter in the universe shows a quite structured distribution of galaxies and voids .",
    "this structure has led some authors [ 1 ] to tentatively describe galaxy clustering using a fractal distribution with a dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the results of a number of redshift surveys [ 2,3 ] indicate that , indeed , there is a certain hierarchy in the universe , with stars forming galaxies , galaxies grouping themselves in groups , clusters and superclusters . a rough limit to this clustering",
    "is seen at a distance of about 200 @xmath1 mpc and the present redshift surveys do not show evidence of large - scale structures beyond this scale .",
    "particularly , in very large scales - those probed by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments , especially by the cobe - dmr experiment - there is no evidence of violation of local isotropy [ 4 ] .",
    "however , we should note that the existence of such a crossover towards homogenization , as well as the exact value of the fractal dimension , are questions of intense debate [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "the fractal hypothesis is deeply connected with a topology theorem which states that homogeneity is implied by the condition of local isotropy plus the assumption of analicity ( or regularity ) for the distribution of matter .",
    "it is possible to prove that in a fractal the condition of local isotropy can be satisfied but , since a fractal is a non - analytic structure , the property of homogeneity is not implied [ 8 ] .",
    "this means that the fractal scenario is incompatible with the cp .",
    "observations point out that galaxy structures indeed exhibit fractal properties up to some scale , although a pure fractal description does not seem to be favored at the moment [ 9 ] .",
    "recently , some authors ( e.g. [ 10 - 12 ] ) have had some success in describing the clustering properties of visible matter in the universe in terms of a multifractal phenomenon associated with density thresholds applied to multifractal sets .",
    "they show that both a hybrid fractal and a multifractal approaches can reasonably describe the matter distribution up to @xmath2 mpc .    in spite of the relative success of the multifractal approach to describe the distribution of matter in the universe",
    ", it is important to understand the physics behind this framework . in general terms",
    ", the multifractal description of galaxies may represent a strange attractor that is the nonlinear outcome of the dynamical equations of gravitational galaxy clustering [ 13,14 ] .",
    "however , it is not simple to find a dynamical connection between fractal sets and galaxy clustering . in this work",
    "we propose an alternative solution to this problem , using the generalized thermostatistics ( gts ) formalism [ 15 ] .",
    "we show that applying the idea of nonextensivity , intrinsic to gts , it is possible to derive an expression for the correlation function , describing the scaling properties of large - scale structures in the universe .",
    "the present approach is based on the assumption of a scale dependent correlation dimension ( @xmath3 ) , which leads to a reconciliation with observational data at various scales , showing a smooth transition from a clustered , fractal universe to large - scale homogeneity , with @xmath4 .",
    "the physical motivation behind our approach is the peculiar behavior of large - scale gravitational systems , dominated by the unshielded , long - range nature of gravity .",
    "in contrast , other many - body systems , like neutral gases and plasmas , are characterized by short - range interactions . because of this fundamental difference",
    ", the standard boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics can not be applied to gravitating systems , since the long - range nature of gravity strongly violates one of its basic premises ( short - ranged effective interactions ) , and , thus , special techniques are needed [ 16 ] .",
    "one possibility to overcome this difficulty  adopted by us  is to use the gts , a theory proposed to correct boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics in those cases where its prescriptions fail .",
    "in the context of galaxy clustering , the important exponent is the correlation dimension @xmath3 [ 10 ] , which is defined in terms of the scaling of the correlation integral @xmath5 over a distance @xmath6 ( normalized by a reference scale l ) :",
    "@xmath7    where @xmath8 is the two - point correlation function , @xmath9 is the mean density of objects and @xmath10 is a constant . by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) with respect to @xmath6 we get :    @xmath11    considering that in large enough scales we have @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath14 and    @xmath15    based on the scaling properties of multifractals , a generalization of boltzmann - gibbs thermostatistics has been proposed [ 15 ] through the introduction of a family of generalized entropy functionals @xmath16 with a single parameter @xmath17 .",
    "these functionals reduce to the classical , extensive boltzmann - gibbs form as @xmath18 .",
    "the generalized entropy has been successfully used to describe a wide range of phenomena , including long - range interactions [ 17 ] , turbulence [ 18 - 20 ] , anomalous diffusion [ 21 ] , among others . for an up - to - date list of references on gts and its applications ,",
    "see [ 22 ] .    for a system with @xmath19 microscopic state probabilities @xmath20 , that are normalized according to @xmath21",
    ", the gts formalism is based upon two axioms .",
    "first , the entropy of the system is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath17 are real constants .",
    "second , an experimental measurement of an observable @xmath24 , whose value in state @xmath25 is @xmath26 , yields the ( unnormalized ) @xmath17-expectation value , @xmath27 of the observable @xmath24 .    within the framework of gts ,",
    "the following special additivity rule holds : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an arbitrary volume . in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ ca1 ] ) , the entropic index @xmath17 characterizes the degree of nonextensivity of the system .",
    "nonextensivity implies that @xmath30 is not uniformly distributed within @xmath29 but rather concentrated on a subset of noninteger dimension @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the following scaling relation holds : @xmath31    the reasoning above may be extended to the context of galaxy clustering if we assume the correlation integral @xmath5 as being the observable in eq .",
    "( [ ca1 ] ) .",
    "thus , with the additional assumption of a scale dependent entropic parameter @xmath32 , from eqs .",
    "( [ ca1 ] ) and ( [ ca2 ] ) , it immediately follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the correlation dimension and @xmath35 will be determined later .    the idea of relating nonextensivity and multiscaling through a scale dependent correlation dimension , as given by eq .",
    "( [ ca3 ] ) , has been originally proposed by us in the context of fully developed turbulence [ 18,19 ] .",
    "interestingly , chen and bak [ 23 ] recently suggested a similar relation , derived from a simple reaction - diffusion model of turbulent phenomena , as a new geometric form for describing the distribution of luminous matter in the universe [ 24 ] .    to be complete",
    ", the above formulation shall contain a model for @xmath32 .",
    "we suggest the following simple _ ansatz _ : @xmath36 or equivalently @xmath37 , with @xmath38 . at large scales , as @xmath6 grows , we have @xmath18 and @xmath13 . the appropriate choice of @xmath39 sets the value of @xmath3 at a lower reference scale .",
    ", and for the present model , for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( solid line ) ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( dashed line ) ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( long dashed line ) ; with @xmath46 mpc for all cases . for comparison purposes , a purely fractal description ( @xmath47 ) and a homogeneous scenario ( @xmath48 ) are also displayed ( dotted straight lines ) .",
    ", width=377 ]    we compared our model against observational data from various redshift surveys [ 2,3 ] .",
    "results are shown in figs . 1 and 2 , for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( solid line ) ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( dashed line ) ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( long dashed line ) ; with @xmath46 mpc for all cases . for comparison purposes , a purely fractal description ( @xmath47 ) and a homogeneous scenario ( @xmath48 )",
    "are also depicted in fig .",
    "1 ( dotted straight lines ) .",
    "we observe that for @xmath49 , which corresponds to the simplest relation between @xmath17 and @xmath6 , our results show a good agreement with observational data for both the two - point correlation function and the correlation dimension .",
    "increasing @xmath50 , we may obtain a better fitting for @xmath51 at the expense of the correlation dimension data .",
    "the opposite is true for decreasing values of @xmath50 .",
    "equations ( [ corr2 ] ) and ( [ ca3 ] ) offer a quantitative description of matter clustering in the universe , and of the smooth transition from small - scale nonextensive fractal behavior to large - scale extensive homogeneity . from a geometrical point of view",
    ", our model shows a universe displaying a clear hierarchy , with predominance of point - like ( @xmath52 ) and filamentary ( @xmath53 ) structures at small scales , and surface - like ones ( @xmath54 ) at intermediate scales . for sufficiently large scales ( @xmath55 )",
    ", the homogeneity predicted by the cosmological principle is recovered .",
    "all these features of the present approach are in good agreement with observational data .    summarizing",
    ", we may say that our primary motivation in this work was to investigate the prediction of multiscaling and nonextensivity of large - scale structures in the universe within the context of the generalized thermostatistics formalism .",
    "the results presented above suggest that we can not discard this theoretical framework as a viable way to explain the gravitational clustering in the universe . however , we should be careful and keep in mind two important caveats : the poorness of observational data in some scale domains may be masking the results , and the fact that luminous galaxies may not perfectly trace the mass distribution ( the biasing problem ) . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", what is missing at the moment is a detailed understanding of how @xmath17 vary with scale . in the present work",
    ", we adopted the simplest model that provided a good agreement with the data .",
    "we are currently running a number of cobe - normalized cdm simulations for some relevant cosmological models [ 25 ] .",
    "we believe that further study on the resulting correlations and velocity distributions , at different scales ( from galaxies to superclusters ) , may reveal the connection between the entropic parameter and the dynamics of mass clustering in the universe .",
