    "collisionless shocks are driven in various situations in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "they often accelerate particles and generate nonthermal high - energy particles . such shocks in supernova remnants",
    "are known as the accelerators of nonthermal electrons ( e.g. , sn1006 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are also believed to be the accelerators of cosmic rays with energies up to the knee energy ( @xmath0 ev ) .",
    "collisionless shocks also exist in electron - positron plasmas , for example , that in the crab nebula , and they are considered to generate nonthermal , high - energy electrons and positrons as well .",
    "recently , it has been suggested from observations that the magnetic fields are amplified or generated around collisionless shocks in several supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields may be generated by the high - energy particles accelerated at the shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", such a generation mechanism can be related to the microphysics of the collisionless shocks themselves . for the generation of magnetic fields in the relativistic shocks associated with the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts",
    ", @xcite suggested that the weibel instability @xcite is driven at the shock and generates strong magnetic fields .",
    "this mechanism can work in shocks in electron - positron plasmas as well .    for electron - positron plasmas",
    ", the weibel instability has been investigated in detail by using numerical simulations .",
    "several particle - in - cell simulations showed that in counterstreaming electron - positron plasmas , the weibel instability develops and generates a strong , sub - equipartition magnetic field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some authors found that in their simulations with longer calculation times , a shock - like structure that associates with a strong magnetic field is formed even in unmagnetized electron - positron plasmas @xcite .",
    "thus , it should be clarified whether the shock - like structure can be regarded as a shock from a macroscopic point of view , for example , whether the structure dissipates the upstream bulk kinetic energy at the `` shock '' transition region or propagates at a steady speed into the upstream plasma , etc .",
    ", as well as other detailed features .",
    "if they are considered as shocks , it is also important to elucidate the role of the strong magnetic fields generated by the weibel - like instability in the dissipation of the shock .    in this study",
    ", we further investigate the dynamics of collisionless shocks in unmagnetized electron - positron plasmas in detail by performing a high - resolution two - dimensional particle - in - cell simulation and confirm that a kind of collisionless shocks indeed forms mainly due to the magnetic fields generated by the weibel - like instability .",
    "however , we also find that no efficient particle acceleration occurs in the shock and the generated magnetic fields rapidly decay within the shock transition region , while in the real world , particles are accelerated at the shocks and large - scale , sub - equipartition magnetic fields are generated around the shocks .",
    "the reasons why these processes are not observed in our simulation may be related to the background magnetic field , the spatial and temporal scales of the simulation , or the composition of the plasma .",
    "in order to investigate the collisionless shocks in electron - positron plasmas without background magnetic fields , we performed numerical simulations . the simulation code is a relativistic , electromagnetic , particle - in - cell code with two spatial and three velocity dimensions ( 2d3v ) developed based on a standard method described by @xcite .",
    "thus , the basic equations of the simulation are the maxwell s equations ( in gaussian units ) : @xmath1 with @xmath2 as constraints , where @xmath3 is the speed of light ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the electric and magnetic fields , respectively ; @xmath6 , the current density ; and @xmath7 , the charge density , together with the equation of motion of particles : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the charge and mass of the particle , respectively ; @xmath11 , the lorentz factor of the particle ; and @xmath12 , the 4-velocity of the particle ( where @xmath13 is the ordinary 3-velocity ) .",
    "particle velocities are often denoted in terms of the 4-velocity throughout this paper .    in the following ,",
    "we consider @xmath14 as the unit of time and the electron skin depth @xmath15 as the unit of length , where @xmath16 is the electron plasma frequency defined for the mean electron number density @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the electron mass , and @xmath19 is the electron charge .",
    "the units of electric and magnetic fields are both taken as @xmath20 ; they are defined so that their corresponding energy densities are both equivalent to the half of the mean electron rest mass energy density .",
    "the simulations were performed on a grid of @xmath21 with @xmath22 particles for each species .",
    "the physical size of the simulation box is @xmath23 in the unit of @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the size of a cell is @xmath25 in the same unit .",
    "the time step is taken as @xmath26 .",
    "since we consider collisionless shocks in unmagnetized plasmas , the electromagnetic fields were initially set to zero over the entire simulation box .",
    "the boundary condition of the electromagnetic field is periodic in each direction .    in this simulation , a collisionless shock wave",
    "is driven according to the well - known `` injection method . ''",
    "there are two walls at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "they reflect particles specularly , but let the electromagnetic waves pass through freely ; the electromagnetic waves propagating outside the walls ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are dissipated by means of ohmic dissipation so that they can not reach the wall at the other side .",
    "initially , both the electrons and positrons are loaded uniformly in the region between the two walls with a bulk velocity of @xmath31 ( thus , the corresponding bulk lorentz factor is @xmath32 ) .",
    "their thermal velocities were given so that the distribution of each component of the 4-velocity @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) obeys the gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath35 in the plasma rest frame , or the `` fluid '' frame .",
    "( in effect , this generates the maxwell distribution . ) at the initial stage of the simulation , particles that were located near the right wall ( at @xmath36 ) were reflected by the wall and then interacted with the incoming particles , i.e. , the upstream plasma .",
    "this interaction causes some instabilities and then a collisionless shock is formed .",
    "it should be noted that the frame of the simulation corresponds to the downstream rest frame .",
    "thus , we observed the propagation of the shock from right to the left in the downstream rest frame .",
    "the following figures show the quantities at the end of the simulation ( @xmath37 ) otherwise stated .",
    "figure  [ fig : ne ] shows the electron number density normalized to the initial number density , or the far upstream number density , measured in the downstream rest frame , @xmath17 . in this figure ,",
    "the left - hand side and the right - hand side correspond to upstream and downstream of the shock , respectively .",
    "we observe that the number density rapidly increases while crossing the transition region , which extends roughly from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , and then it becomes homogeneous by moving further downstream .",
    "the transition region does not have a one - dimensional structure but a two - dimensional filamentary structure with density fluctuations along the @xmath40 direction .",
    "the typical size of the filaments is in the order of several electron skin depths .",
    "figure  [ fig : ne_history ] shows the time development of the electron number density .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axes represent the @xmath41 coordinate and time , respectively .",
    "the plotted number density is averaged over the @xmath40 direction .",
    "we observe that the transition region , which is visible as the jump in the number density , propagates upstream , i.e. , to the left , with time at an almost constant speed . from this figure ,",
    "the propagation speed measured in the downstream rest frame is estimated to be @xmath42 .",
    "the thin structure propagating upstream at almost the speed of light , which is visible in the lower - left portion of this figure , is due to the particles reflected at the right wall at a very early stage of the simulation .",
    "this is of course the consequence of the initial condition , but such a situation may be realized in real cases .",
    "anyway , this structure fades away with time , and it would not affect the structure around the transition region later .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile ] shows the @xmath40-averaged profiles of three quantities around the shock transition region : ( a ) the electron number density , @xmath43 ; ( b ) the mean velocity of electrons in the @xmath41-direction , @xmath44 ; and ( c ) the magnitude of electric and magnetic fields , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile]a , the solid curve and the dashed curve represent the number densities at @xmath37 and @xmath47 , respectively . comparing the two curves , we see that the transition region propagates upstream keeping its averaged structure almost unchanged .",
    "the compression ratio measured in the downstream rest frame is approximately @xmath48 .",
    "the mean velocity of electrons in the @xmath41 direction , @xmath49 , rapidly approaches zero within the transition region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile]b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile]c , it is notable that a strong magnetic field exists within the transition region ( @xmath50 ) . we also see that behind the shock transition region , the strength of the magnetic field decreases and strong electric and magnetic fields exist even in the upstream region . these points will be mentioned later .    figure  [ fig : bz_jx]a shows the @xmath51 component of the magnetic field , @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that a strong magnetic field exists within the transition region ( @xmath53 ) , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile]c . figure  [ fig : bz_jx]b shows the current density in the @xmath41 direction , @xmath54 .",
    "we observed that there are considerable number of current filaments that carry currents in the @xmath41 direction within the transition region .",
    "the filamentary structure observed in the number density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ne ] ) is in fact due to the existence of these current filaments .",
    "they generate a magnetic field fluctuating in the @xmath40 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_jx]a .",
    "this situation in which strong magnetic fields fluctuating perpendicular to the direction of streaming are generated is similar to those in the simulations of the weibel instability in counterstreaming plasmas @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider that in the transition region in which the upstream plasma is mixed up with the downstream plasma , a large velocity dispersion in the @xmath41 direction and hence a large anisotropy in the particle velocity distribution are induced ; further , the anisotropy drives the weibel - type instability , which generates the magnetic field .",
    "the typical magnitude of the magnetic field in this region is @xmath55 and the corresponding larmor radius for the incoming upstream particles with @xmath56 is @xmath57 , which is comparable to the size of the magnetic field structure , i.e. , the current filaments , in the transition region .",
    "therefore , the incoming upstream particles should be isotropised in this region because they are deflected at a large angle by the strong magnetic field at this location .",
    "this isotropisation provides an effective dissipation mechanism for the upstream bulk kinetic energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : ub ] shows the @xmath40-averaged profile of the magnetic energy density normalized by the upstream bulk kinetic energy density .",
    "we see that the magnetic energy density reaches about 10% of the upstream bulk kinetic energy density at the peak and decays downstream of the shock .",
    "the saturation and decay mechanism of the magnetic field would be similar to those of the weibel instability @xcite .",
    "the current and the magnetic field generated by the instability in each filament saturates when the magnetic field becomes strong enough to deflect the current - carrying particles in the filament .",
    "this predicts the sub - equipartition magnetic field at saturation and it is consistent with the simulation result .",
    "after the saturation , the current filaments will coalesce with each other to form larger filaments with the decreasing magnetic field strength .",
    "we observe the evolution of the structure to a larger scale together with the decay of the magnetic field strength downstream of the shock transition region in figs .",
    "[ fig : bz_jx]a , [ fig : profile]c , and [ fig : ub ] .    figure  [ fig : vx_ke ] shows ( a ) the fluid velocity of electrons in the @xmath41-direction , @xmath58 , and ( b ) the mean kinetic energy of the electrons measured in the _ local _ fluid rest frame of the electrons expressed in terms of electron rest mass , @xmath59 .",
    "it is evident that the incoming plasma from upstream is rapidly decelerated within the transition region , where the strong magnetic field exists ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_jx]a ) , and its bulk kinetic energy is converted into random or `` thermal '' kinetic energy in the downstream rest frame .    figure  [ fig : sgmx_sgmy ] shows the standard deviations of ( a ) @xmath60 of electrons , @xmath61 , and ( b ) @xmath62 of electrons , @xmath63 , both measured in the local plasma rest frame of the electrons .",
    "we observe that the particles are isotropised in the transition region due to the strong magnetic field existing there .",
    "it should be noted that , in this two - dimensional simulation , particles are isotropised only on the @xmath64 plane and not in the @xmath51 direction ( c.f .",
    "* ) because only the weibel modes with wave vectors on the @xmath64 plane can develop and hence only @xmath52 is generated . in a three - dimensional simulation , the weibel modes with wave vectors in the @xmath51 direction",
    "should develop equally and particles are isotropised in all directions .    in a macroscopic view , the features shown in the above figures would be observed as those of shock waves ; the shock waves dissipate the upstream bulk kinetic energy in the shock transition region and propagate at an almost constant speed into the upstream plasma . in this sense",
    ", we can regard this as a collisionless shock . in this shock , the magnetic field in the transition region generated by the weibel - like",
    "instability plays an essential role in the dissipation process of the collisionless shock in unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "it should be noted that the shock has no corresponding fundamental linear wave , which is required to define the mach number , in contrast to , for example , the perpendicular shocks in magnetized plasmas , in which the magnetosonic wave is the fundamental linear wave of the shock .",
    "this point is clear from the fact that the wave vector of the magnetic field in the transition region is in the @xmath40 direction and not in the @xmath41 direction or the shock normal in the present case and hence it has an essentially a two - dimensional structure .",
    "thus , it can be said that this is a class of `` instability - driven '' shock waves .",
    "for such shocks , the concept of the mach number would not be applicable , and the propagation speed of the shock and the width of the transition region would be essentially determined by the nature of the instability that provides the dissipation mechanism at the shock transition region .      from fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_jx]b , we observe that there are current filaments even in the upstream region ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho_ex_ey]a shows the charge density @xmath7 .",
    "comparing these two figures , it is evident that these filaments have a net space charge . since in each filament ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath7 have the same sign , these filaments are mainly composed of the incoming upstream particles with @xmath66 . figure  [ fig : rho_ex_ey]b shows the @xmath40 component of the electric field , @xmath67 .",
    "we observe that @xmath67 is generated between these filaments due to their space charge . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_jx]a , these filaments also generate magnetic field @xmath52 around them .",
    "thus , rather strong electric and magnetic fields exist in the upstream region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile]c . figure  [ fig : rho_ex_ey]c shows the @xmath41 component of the electric field .",
    "we observed that strong electric fields exist at the upstream edge of the transition region and that there is a coherent structure in @xmath68 in the upstream of the transition region ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the region where the charge - separated current filaments exist would correspond to `` the charge separation layer '' suggested by @xcite . as they pointed out ,",
    "these filaments need a small fraction of the particles flowing backward to stabilize themselves .",
    "figure  [ fig : electron_x_ux ] shows the @xmath69 phase - space plot of electrons at @xmath70 .",
    "we observe that the particles flowing backward ( @xmath71 ) are supplied around the shock transition region ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "these particles would stabilize the charge - separated current filaments in the charge separation layer .",
    "they can also drive the electrostatic beam instability .",
    "the coherent electrostatic field @xmath68 upstream of the transition region ( @xmath65 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : rho_ex_ey]c ) would be induced by this instability .",
    "these particles should also contribute to drive the weibel - type instability around the transition region .",
    "figure  [ fig : backward_electron_x_t ] shows the time development of the number density of electrons again as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ne_history ] , but with contours .",
    "we observe that there is a `` precursor '' region in which the number density is within a range of @xmath73 in front of the transition region . in this region ,",
    "the increase in the number density from that in the upstream plasma @xmath17 would be mainly due to the electrons flowing backward ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : electron_x_ux ] ) .",
    "the width of the precursor region is almost constant ( @xmath74 ) after @xmath75 .    as already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_jx]b , there are current filaments in the transition region .",
    "however , they are charge - separated only at the filament edges except those at the downstream side that are continuously connected to the thermalized downstream region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rho_ex_ey]a ) .",
    "the strength of the magnetic and electric fields , current density , and charge density all attain their maximum values in this region , and the upstream kinetic energy is dissipated mainly by the magnetic field and partly by the electric field .    a fraction of the downstream particles flowing backward with @xmath76 , which is the 4-velocity corresponding to @xmath77 , can return upstream through the filaments that carry the currents in the same direction as the particles . on the other hand , if the particles return through the filament carrying opposite currents , the magnetic fields in the filaments repel the particles from the filaments .",
    "figure  [ fig : electron_m2_x_y ] shows the distribution of electrons that are flowing upstream with @xmath78 . by comparing with @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_jx]b , we observed that these electrons indeed flow in the current filaments with @xmath79 . in a similar manner , the positrons flow backward in the current filaments , but with @xmath80 ( not shown here ) .",
    "however , only a small fraction of the backward flowing particles can move to the upstream region ( @xmath65 ) because large potential barriers exist , caused by the charge density at the upstream edge of the filaments ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig : rho_ex_ey]a and [ fig : rho_ex_ey]c ) .",
    "the particles that could pass through to the upstream region would contribute to stabilize the charge - separated current filaments in the charge separation layer , as mentioned earlier .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist_ke_downstream ] shows the energy histogram of the electrons accumulated over the area between @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the downstream region ( the solid histogram ) .",
    "the dashed curve and the dot - dashed curve represent the maxwell distributions in three and two dimensions , which are defined by @xmath83 and @xmath84,\\ ] ] respectively . here , @xmath85 is the number density in the downstream region , @xmath86 is the modified bessel function of the second kind @xcite , and @xmath87 is determined so that @xmath88 , which is expected if the upstream bulk kinetic energy is completely converted into the internal kinetic energy in the downstream rest frame . from fig .",
    "[ fig : profile]a , we consider @xmath89 .",
    "it is observed that the electron distribution fits neither of the maxwell distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist_ke_all ] shows the energy histogram of all electrons in the simulation box by a solid histogram . for reference , we plotted the three - dimensional maxwell distribution by the dotted curve .",
    "their normalizations are arbitrary , and there is no significant particle acceleration .",
    "the simulation results clearly show that collisionless shocks can be driven in unmagnetized electron - positron plasmas . the structure of the collisionless shock propagates at an almost constant speed .",
    "the dissipation of the upstream bulk kinetic energy is mainly due to the deflection of particles by the strong magnetic field generated around the shock transition region by the weibel - type instability .",
    "it is remarkable that this shock has no corresponding linear wave and therefore it can be regarded as a kind of `` instability - driven '' shock wave .",
    "we also observed the electric and magnetic field generation even in the upstream of the shock transition region due to the charge - separated current filaments together with the electrostatic beam instability .",
    "we found that a fraction of the downstream thermalized particles return upstream through the shock transition region .",
    "these particles would interact with the upstream incoming plasma and cause the generation of the charge - separated current filaments as well as the electrostatic beam instability upstream of the transition region .",
    "we did not observe any efficient particle acceleration processes in our simulation , whereas we observed relatively rapid decay of the generated magnetic field within the shock transition region . on the other hand , in the real world , there are many evidences to suggest that particles are accelerated at shocks , and there are several indications that large - scale , sub - equipartition magnetic fields may be generated around these shocks",
    ". the reasons why these processes were not observed in our simulation may be that ( 1 ) the background magnetic field is essential for them , ( 2 ) the spatial and temporal scales of the simulation are too small to deal with them , or ( 3 ) these processes are inefficient in the electron - positron shocks .",
