    "with the wide stream of new high - quality data flowing from rhic , as well as with the continued efforts at sps ( for recent results see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , there is a growing need for a simple description of the basic underlying physics .",
    "only then our understanding of the phenomena occurring in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be pushed forward , and space made for potential new phenomena , hitherto unexplained within the basic picture . in this lecture",
    "we argue that most of the `` soft '' features of the data from rhic ( particle ratios , momentum spectra , hbt correlation radii ) can be explained very efficiently within an embarrassingly simple model , which merges the thermal model @xcite with expansion , and incorporates in a complete way the resonances @xcite .",
    "our description uses hadronic degrees of freedom and starts at freeze - out , _",
    "i.e. _ at the point of the space - time evolution of the system where the hadrons cease to interact .",
    "pertinent theoretical questions , such as what had been happening before freeze - out , what had led to the strong expansion of the system , why is the thermal picture successful , what is the nature of hadronization , not to mention the notorious",
    "_ `` was there quark - gluon plasma ? '' _ , will not and can not be addressed in this lecture .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our studies prepare ground for such questions .",
    "historically , the ideas of the thermal description of a hadronic system go back to the works of koppe @xcite , fermi @xcite , landau @xcite , and hagedorn @xcite . more recently",
    ", many groups have used these ideas in numerous papers in an effort to explain the data from various relativistic heavy - ion experiments , from sis , through ags and sps , to rhic . along the way",
    ", the original picture has been occasionally supplied with extra features , such as the fugacities controlling deviations from chemical equilibrium @xcite , finite volume and van der waals corrections @xcite , or the use of the canonical instead of the grand - canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the works of heinz and collaborators @xcite put forward the concept of two freeze - outs . as the system expands and cools , it first passes through the chemical freeze - out point at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "later , the particles can only rescatter elastically , until these processes are switched off at a lower temperature @xmath2 . in an appealing way the distinct freeze - outs explained the need for a higher temperature to reproduce well the particle ratios , and a much lower temperature to describe the slopes of the momentum spectra . in our work",
    "@xcite we have shown that with the complete treatment of resonances , the distinction between the two freeze - outs is not needed , at least for rhic , and one can achieve very good explanation of all `` soft '' features of data assuming one universal freeze - out , @xmath3 we have also dropped , with the ockham razor at hand , all other additions to the most naive thermal approach .",
    "the dropped features may be reconsidered later on , provided there is a well - established phenomenological need , or theoretical argumentation .",
    "the main ingredients of our model are as follows :    * there is one freeze - out , as discussed above , at which all the hadrons occupy the available phase space according to the statistical distribution factors .",
    "the scenario with a single freeze - out is natural if the hadronization occurs in such conditions that neither elastic nor inelastic processes are effective .",
    "an example here is the picture of the supercooled plasma of ref .",
    "moreover , the star collaboration @xcite has presented an important argument in favor of very weak rescattering after the chemical freeze - out at rhic , based on the observation of the @xmath4 peaks in the pion - kaon correlations .",
    "this essentially shows that the expansion time between the chemical and thermal freeze - out is shorter than the life - time of the @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 fm/@xmath6 . additionally , the fact that the measured yields of @xmath4 @xcite are reproduced very well within the thermal model @xcite hints to the scenario with a short time between the two possible freeze - outs , as proposed in ref .",
    "thus , approximation ( [ tuniv ] ) is reasonable .",
    "* a crucial feature of our analysis is the _ complete _ treatment of the hadronic states , with all resonances from the particle data table @xcite included in the analysis of both the ratios and the momentum spectra ( cf .",
    "[ fig : therm ] ) .",
    "although the high - lying states are suppressed by the thermal factors , their number increases according to the hagedorn hypothesis @xcite , such that their net effect is important .",
    "for instance , only a quarter of the observed pions at rhic comes from the `` primordial '' pions present at freeze - out , and three quarters are produced via resonance decays .",
    "all decays , two and three body , are implemented in cascades , with the branching ratios taken from the tables . for the @xmath7-spectra",
    "the resonances are also very important , since their decays increase the slope , as if the temperature were effectively lower @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that the inclusion of resonances speeds up the cooling of the system in hydrodynamic calculations @xcite . * whereas expansion of the system does not alter the particle ratios at midrapidity ( provided the system is boost - invariant , which is a good approximation at rhic , see sec .",
    "[ sec : expansion ] ) , it becomes absolutely essential for the @xmath7-spectra .",
    "we model the expansion ( transverse flow ) and the size of the system with two parameters : the proper time at freeze - out , @xmath8 , and the transverse size , @xmath9 . *",
    "the model has altogether four adjustable parameters : two thermal and two geometric , which possess clear physical interpretation .",
    "the two thermal parameters , temperature , @xmath10 , and the baryon chemical potential , @xmath11 , are fixed by the analysis of the ratios of the particle abundances @xcite .",
    "the two geometric parameters are fixed with help of the @xmath0-spectra .",
    "the invariant time @xmath8 controls the overall normalization of the spectra , while the ratio @xmath12 directly influences their slopes .",
    "all data used in the present study are for au+au collisions at @xmath13  gev .",

    "the preliminary experimental numbers for @xmath23 @xcite have changed @xcite , and better agreement with the model followed . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     to summarize this section ,",
    "we conclude that the successful and economic description of the spectra , as seen from figs .",
    "[ f0 ] , [ fcen ] , and [ f1 ] , provides a strong support for the thermal approach with universal freeze - out in the description of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "in the presented model the fitted values for the geometric parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are low , of the order of the size of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this leads to two problems : 1 ) the values of the hbt radii , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : hbt ] would be too small compared to the experiment , and 2 ) there would be little time left for the system to develop large transverse flow .",
    "both problems can be solved with the inclusion of the excluded - volume ( van der waals ) corrections .",
    "such effects were realized to be important already in the previous studies of the particle multiplicities in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , where they led to a significant dilution of system . in the case of the classical boltzmann statistics , which is a very good approximation for our system @xcite , the excluded volume corrections bring in a factor @xcite @xmath24 into the phase - space integrals , where @xmath25 denotes the pressure , @xmath26 is the excluded volume for the particle of species @xmath27 , , hence the factor of 4 in the definition of @xmath28 . ] and @xmath29 is the density of particles of species @xmath27 . the pressure must be calculated self - consistently from the equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the partial pressure of the ideal gas of hadrons of species @xmath27 . for the simplest case where the excluded volumes for all particles are equal , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the excluded - volume correction ( [ vdw ] ) produces a scale factor common to all particles , which we can denote by @xmath34 .",
    "the formula ( [ dni ] ) becomes @xmath35 the presence of the factor @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ dni2 ] ) may be compensated by rescaling @xmath36 and @xmath8 by the factor @xmath37 .",
    "that way , we retain all the previously obtained results for the particle abundances and the momentum spectra . however , now the system is more dilute and larger in size .    next , we present an estimate of @xmath37 . with our values of the thermodynamic parameters we have @xmath38mev/@xmath39 , which leads to @xmath40 with @xmath41fm",
    ". values of this order have been typically obtained in other works .",
    "thus , the excluded - volume corrections can increase the size parameters at freeze - out by about 30% , and in consequence the problems 1 ) and 2 ) are alleviated : the geometric parameters become large enough to be reconciled with expansion , and the hbt correlation radii can be properly reproduced , see sec . [",
    "sec : hbt ] .",
    ", @xmath42 , and their ratio , as predicted by the model ( solid line ) and measured by the phenix collaboration . , width=264 ]    the transverse hbt radii @xmath43 and @xmath42 ( here we use the bertsch - pratt @xcite parameterization ) measured @xcite at rhic have values very close to those measured at smaller beam energies . only the longitudinal radius , @xmath44 , exhibits a monotonic growth with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the weak energy dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath42 has come as a great puzzle , since the rhic beam energy , @xmath13 gev , is almost one order of magnitude larger than the sps energy , @xmath45 = 17 gev , and based on the hydrodynamic calculations one would expect much larger systems to be produced at rhic .",
    "also , a longer life - time of the firecylinder was expected at rhic , which should be reflected in longer emission times of pions , which in turn would result in the ratio @xmath46 much larger than unity @xcite . on the contrary , the experimental measurements indicate that @xmath46 is compatible with unity in the whole range of the studied transverse - momenta of the pion pair ( @xmath47 gev ) .",
    "this fact is another surprise delivered by the analysis of the rhic data for the pion - pion correlations .",
    "we have computed the pion hbt radii in our model .",
    "the calculation is based on the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , and is similar to the case of the particle spectra shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : expansion ] .",
    "details will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the results of an approximate calculation neglecting the hadronic widths are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbt ] , where the hbt radii are plotted as a function of the transverse momentum of the pion pair , @xmath48 .",
    "we note that very reasonable agreement with the data is achieved .",
    "we have used @xmath40 of sec . [",
    "sec : exclude ] .",
    "in particular , the ratio @xmath46 ( independent of the scale factor @xmath37 ) is close to unity .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence of @xmath43 is a bit too flat .",
    "the longitudinal radius , @xmath44 , is sensitive to the cut - off in the rapidity distribution and can not be reliably computed in the present , boost - invariant , model .",
    "the presented results for the hadron production at rhic support the idea that particles are produced thermally , and this is the basic lesson for today .",
    "the simple , economic model with the approximation of a universal freeze - out , simple expansion , and complete treatment of resonances , predicts the particle ratios , the transverse - momentum spectra , and the hbt correlation radii for the pion in agreement with the data .",
    "we note that the thermal approach works noticeably better at the rhic energies than at lower energies , where , _",
    "e.g. _ , the particle ratios are not described to that accuracy @xcite , or the spectrum of the @xmath49 baryons is not reproduced .",
    "this indicates that the soft physics becomes simpler at rhic , with our model being able to yield the quite impressive results of table 1 and figs .",
    "[ f0 ] , [ fcen ] , [ f1 ] , and [ fig : hbt ] .    in our phenomenology the pre - freeze - out",
    "stages are hidden and only the conditions at the moment where the hadrons decouple are relevant .",
    "this provides useful constraints for the more microscopic approaches . these calculations , describing early stages of the evolution ,",
    "should ultimately provide the freeze - out conditions such as , or similar , to the ones used in our study .",
    "certainly , the most challenging theoretical question which remains and should be addressed in future efforts is _ why the model works so nicely _ , and what it means for the underlying physics of particle production and the mechanism of hadronization .",
    "we are grateful professor andrzej budzanowski for his encouragement and interest in this work , to marek gadzicki for numerous helpful discussions , and to boris hippolyte for pointing out the early experimental spectra for the @xmath49 baryons .",
