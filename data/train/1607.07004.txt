    "besides the elemental abundances , isotopic ratios in stars and interstellar matter ( ism ) provide important clues on stellar evolution and galactic chemical evolution",
    ". however , isotopic effects are prominent only in molecular spectra but not in atomic spectra .",
    "for this reason , isotopic analysis has mostly been done on molecular spectra observed in cool celestial objects such as cool stars and the ism . because of this limitation",
    ", our knowledge on the isotopic abundances in the universe has been rather poor compared to that on the elemental abundances . on the other hand , spectroscopic analyses of the isotopic ratios",
    "are somewhat simpler , compared to those of the elemental abundances , in that the isotopic ratios are relatively insensitive to the physical condition of the environments where spectral lines are formed .",
    "for this reason , isotopic analyses have extensively been done on the spectra of cool stars since the middle of the 20-th century even when analyses on the elemental abundances were more difficult .",
    "for example , initial attempt to determine the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in cool giant stars has been done by @xcite , who showed that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in red giant stars is decreased compared to the solar system value of 89.9 @xcite . then , extensive analyses on the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in g and k giant stars have been done with the use of photoelectric scans of the cn red system ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the results confirmed that the products of the cno cycle are dredged - up in the red giant phase , but the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios appeared to be too small compared with the theoretical predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "studies on the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio were extended to red supergiants @xcite and to agb stars with the use of the high resolution fts spectra ( @xcite , ; @xcite ) . the results on oxygen - rich giants , supergiants , and agb stars revealed that these stars contribute to lower the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in the ism by their mass - loss .",
    "historically , it was on carbon stars that studies on carbon isotopes in stellar spectra have initiated : it was nearly a century ago when @xmath1c bearing molecules were identified by the c@xmath8 swan bands , first as @xmath2c@xmath1c @xcite and next as @xmath1c@xmath1c @xcite in carbon stars ( also referred to as r and n type stars ) .",
    "initial works suggested that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in most carbon stars are in the range of 2  20 , except for a few exceptional case ( @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "this result suggested that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in carbon stars may be related to the equilibrium value of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in the cn cycle .",
    "however , since the @xmath2c@xmath2c swan bands in carbon stars are very strong and heavily saturated while the @xmath2c@xmath1c swan bands less saturated , the intensity ratio of @xmath2c@xmath2c/@xmath2c@xmath1c should apparently be small leading to a low @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio .",
    "for this reason , the very low @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios found in carbon stars can be due to imperfect correction for the saturation effect , and a possibility that @xmath2c/@xmath1c @xmath9 was suggested for some cool carbon stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since then , many works on the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio have been carried out for a large sample of carbon stars : @xcite determined the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in dozens of n type stars through the analysis of the high resolution fts spectra of the cn red system , co first and second overtones , and showed that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in cool carbon stars extend to as large as the solar system value .",
    "determinations of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios were extended through the analysis of the cn red system to 62 n type stars by @xcite and to 44 carbon stars by @xcite .",
    "the results on carbon - rich agb stars revealed that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in these stars are generally larger than in oxygen - rich agb stars and these stars contribute to increase the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in the ism by their mass - loss .",
    "in contrast , isotopic analyses on cool dwarfs are quite limited , even though extensive analyses on elemental abundances in late - type dwarfs have been done ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is true that molecular lines are not so strong in f and g dwarfs .",
    "however , the major reasons for this contrast between high and low luminosity stars may be that the high resolution spectroscopy needed to isolate faint isotopic features could be applied more easily to bright high luminous stars on one hand and also some isotopic features appeared to be enhanced in high luminous cool stars due to the evolutionary effects in the stars themselves .    in m dwarfs , determinations of the elemental abundances",
    "have also been difficult , but we have shown recently that the carbon and oxygen abundances in m dwarfs could be determined rather accurately by the use of the near infrared spectra of co and h@xmath8o , respectively ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hereafter papers i , ii , and iii , respectively ) .",
    "this has been made possible by several reasons : first , the well known difficulty of the continuum in cool stars has been overcome in doing spectroscopic analysis by referring to the pseudo - continuum , which can be evaluated accurately with the use of the recent molecular line - list including many weak lines of h@xmath8o ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "then , spectroscopic analysis can be done essentially the way as referring to the true - continuum , so long as the pseudo - continua can be defined consistently in the observed and predicted spectra .",
    "second , given that carbon and oxygen abundances are determined from stable molecules such as co and h@xmath8o , respectively , the problem of photospheric model should not be so serious .",
    "this is because co consumes most of carbon and h@xmath8o most of oxygen left after co formation , and co abundance is almost identical with that of c and h@xmath8o abundance with that of o@xmath10c in m dwarfs . for this reason , co and h@xmath8o",
    "abundances are insensitive to the uncertainties of the photospheric structures , and carbon and oxygen abundances could be determined rather well despite the use of model photospheres which anyhow can not be very accurate ( as for further details , see e.g. , paper ii ) .",
    "given that the elemental abundances of at least some elements were well determined in m dwarfs , a further important possibility in m dwarfs is that the isotopic ratios can also be determined from the molecular spectra , at the same time as the elemental abundances in the same object . in the near infrared spectra of m dwarfs , not only @xmath2c@xmath6o but also @xmath1c@xmath6o bands are observed , and the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios can be discussed .",
    "a problem is that the spectral resolution of our spectra is about @xmath11 or the velocity resolution is about 16kms@xmath12 .",
    "this resolution barely made it possible to measure equivalent widths and hence to determine the elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen ( papers i , ii , and iii ) .",
    "however , this resolution is not high enough to measure line profiles accurately and hence to analyze faint isotopic features . for this reason , our analysis on the carbon isotopic ratios is necessarily preliminary .",
    "even with this limitation , however , we hope that we can discuss the elemental and isotopic abundances of carbon simultaneously in a large sample of m dwarfs for the first time .    in this paper , we first summarize the known data on our program stars from papers i , ii , and iii in section 2 .",
    "we then investigate how to estimate the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios from the spectra of @xmath1co in section 3 .",
    "the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios , with assessments of the accuracy , are given in section 4 .",
    "the resulting carbon isotopic ratios in m dwarfs are discussed in comparisons with those of the ism in section 5 .",
    "we use the observed data introduced in paper i ( see its table1 ) and iii ( its table1 ) , in which we analyzed @xmath2c@xmath6o and h@xmath8o lines . in this paper , we focus our attention to @xmath1c@xmath6o features recorded on the 24-th order ( 23437  23997 ) of the echelle spectra observed with the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs : @xcite ) of the subaru telescope .",
    "the resolution @xmath13 is about 20000 or the velocity resolution is about 16kms@xmath12 . in our observations ,",
    "the targets were nodded along the slit , and observations were taken in an abba sequence , where a and b stand for the first and second positions on the slit ( paper i ) . for estimating the signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio , the noise level is estimated from the difference of the spectra observed at a and b positions .",
    "the resulting s / n ratio is given in the last column of table 3 for each object , and the s / n ratios are mostly between about 50 and 150 .",
    "our program stars consist of m dwarfs studied so far by us : we first determined the fundamental parameters such as @xmath14 and log@xmath15 , prepared model photospheres , and determined carbon abundances based on the @xmath2c@xmath6o lines for 42 m dwarfs ( paper i ) . for 38 objects in these 42 m dwarfs , we also determined oxygen abundances from h@xmath8o lines ( paper ii ) .",
    "we then studied additional eight late m dwarfs ( paper iii ) . as a result , we determined carbon and oxygen abundances in 38 + 8 = 46 m dwarfs",
    ".    we did not determine oxygen abundances in four early m dwarfs in which h@xmath8o lines were too weak ( paper ii ) .",
    "however , we estimate oxygen abundances in these four m dwarfs with the use of log@xmath7 ",

    "relation based on 46 m dwarfs for which carbon and oxygen abundances were determined as noted above .",
    "a least square fit to log@xmath7 ( data reproduced in eighth column of table 1 and plotted in fig.6b ) is @xmath18 from which we estimate log@xmath7 and then log@xmath19 by the use of the known log@xmath5 .",
    "we include these four early m dwarfs with the estimated oxygen abundances in our analysis of the carbon isotopic ratio based on co spectra in this paper .",
    "we think that the use of the estimated oxygen abundance can be acceptable , since co spectra depend primarily on carbon abundance and effect of oxygen abundance is rather minor .    from the 38 m dwarfs for which c and o abundances were determined ,",
    "we exclude one object gj686 whose spectrum is disturbed by unknown noise .",
    "also , we could not include 2massij1835379 + 325954 in our sample of eight late m dwarfs , since this object is a rapid rotator ( paper iii ) and isotopic features are completely smeared out . as a result , we have 37 + 7 + 4 = 48 objects for our analysis of the carbon isotopic ratios in this paper .",
    "for 50 m dwarfs we have analyzed through papers i to iii , object , spectral type , @xmath14 , and log@xmath15 are given through first to fourth column in table 1 , and log@xmath5 , log@xmath19 ( including the oxygen abundances estimated with the use of equation 1 ) , and log@xmath7 through sixth to eighth column .

    "however , our result of the @xmath35 analysis , which is a kind of statistical analysis , suggests @xmath2c/@xmath1c@xmath42 both for gj725a and 725b , and we again find consistency within about a factor of two in our analysis .",
    "the results of the @xmath35 analysis reveal that @xmath2c/@xmath1c = 116 and @xmath2c/@xmath1c = 93 for gj797b - ne and 797b - sw , respectively .",

    "the above results imply that it is difficult to determine @xmath2c/@xmath1c value when it is as large as 200 , and if the result of the @xmath35 analysis reveals such a result as @xmath2c/@xmath1c@xmath40 , it is still possible that actual @xmath2c/@xmath1c may be as low as 100 ( e.g. , gj338b and gj725a ) .",

    "although our sample of binary pairs is not large enough , we regard our result of @xmath2c/@xmath1c@xmath42 to be uncertain by about a factor of two but should be better in the case of @xmath2c/@xmath1c@xmath44 .    ",
    "fig . 4 : p.13          unfortunately",
    ", our sample of binary is limited to three pairs and to the cases of rather high @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios . to extend the similar test to other cases",
    ", we use the spectra recorded at a and b positions on slit alternatively during the observation .",
    "the resulting spectra are co - added at the end and used for our analysis so far done ( papers i , ii , and iii ; subsections 4.1 and 4.2 in paper iv ) .",
    "these two spectra observed at slit positions a and b are recovered separately and we analyze these spectra a and b as if they are independent two spectra .",
    "although s / n ratios of these spectra are reduced by about a factor of @xmath45 , these spectra can be used in the same way as in the binary test outlined in the previous subsection .",
    "for this purpose , we select m dwarfs of various @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios and we choose gj876 , 849 , 212 , and 526 as examples . these objects cover the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios from the smallest to the largest and , for this reason , these objects are already used as representative cases in fig.3 .",
    "the spectra observed at a and b positions are analyzed by essentially the same way as we analyze the co - added spectrum in subsection 4.1 and the results are shown in figs.5a - d .",
    "the @xmath28 values for the fitting of the spectrum observed at a or b position and the predicted spectra for five assumed values of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio evaluated by equation(2 ) are given in second through sixth columns of table4 .",
    "the result of the minimization of @xmath28 values is given at the last column of table 4 for each spectrum observed at positions a and b.    the results for the case of gj876 , which is the most @xmath1c rich in our sample , reveal that the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios are 37.7 and 31.4 for the spectra observed at a and b positions ( hereafter be referred to as spectra a and b ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the results for the spectra a and b agree rather well and this may be due to small differences in the features b and d which are most sensitive to the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio ( fig.5a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios are 59.3 and 108.3 for the spectra a and b , respectively , in the case of gj849 , and the difference of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios based on the spectra a and b is rather large",
    ". this may be due to a considerable difference of the feature d in the observed spectra a and b ( fig.5b ) .",
    "the s / n ratios for gj876 and 849 are not much different ( see table 3 ) , but it appears that the effect of noise on the spectra is rather different and complicated .",
    "the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios are 106.9 and 139.7 for the spectra a and b , respectively , in the case of gj212 .",
    "the difference of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio based on the spectra a and b is rather modest . in this case , the @xmath28 values indicates the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios not very different , despite some differences in the spectra observed at positions a and b ( fig.5c ) .",
    "in fact , even if the difference of the observed and predicted spectra ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) at a particular wavelength is disturbed by noise , the @xmath28 value is determined by including the contributions from other wavelength regions less disturbed by noise as well , and the effect of noise can be averaged in the resulting @xmath28 value .",
    "finally , the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios for the spectra observed at a and b positions for gj526 are larger than 200 and 141.0 , respectively . here",
    ", the situation is quite similar to the binary pairs gj338a , b and gj725a , b discussed in subsection 4.2 : since the effect of @xmath1c@xmath6o lines on the spectrum is difficult to discriminate if @xmath2c/@xmath1c @xmath47 it is difficult to determine @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio with the medium resolution we are using .",
    "the results outlined above are summarized in table5 : for each object , the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios based on the spectra observed at a and b positions are shown in second and third columns , respectively .",
    "the mean value of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios based on the spectra at a and b positions is given in fourth column , and the probable error is also estimated .",
    "the resulting probable errors appear to be not so large : about 10% in favorable cases ( gj876 , 212 ) and about 30% in a less favorable case ( gj849 ) . but",
    "uncertainty of as large as a factor of two must be accepted in the poor @xmath1c cases ( e.g. , gj526 ) .",
    "the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio based on the co - added spectrum is reproduced in fifth column from table 3 .",
    "although an error can not be estimated from a single spectrum alone , the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio is roughly within the error bar estimated in the fourth column by using the spectra with s / n ratios reduced by a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the accuracy of our results on the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios can be acceptable , and at least better than 50%c/@xmath1c ratio of the binary system gj797b can be 104.5 @xmath48 11.0 as a mean of those of its constituents gj797b - ne and 797b - sw discussed in subsection 4.2 , and again the error of the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio can be estimated to be about 10% . ] except for the cases of the poor @xmath1c ( e.g. , @xmath2c/@xmath1c @xmath49 ) .",
    "although our spectral resolution is not high enough to resolve the individual @xmath1c@xmath6o lines and the s / n ratios are not very high , the @xmath28 value reflects the integrated effect in the difference of observed and predicted spectra . for this reason , the @xmath27 analysis can be a powerful tool for assessment of the goodness of the fitting .

    "the unweighted mean value of 48 m dwarfs including those with the lower limit of 200 is @xmath50 ( p.e . ) .",
    "if we exclude such a case for which only the lower limit of 200 is known , the unweighted mean value of 31 m dwarfs is @xmath51 ( p.e . ) .",
    "this value agrees well with the value of the solar system , @xmath52 @xcite . also , the value of the solar photosphere based on the high resolution infrared solar spectrum is @xmath53 @xcite or @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "then the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio of the solar photosphere as well as of the solar system is typical of the unevolved late - type dwarfs .",
    "however , the scatter of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in table 3 is rather large extending from @xmath55 = 39 to @xmath56 ( also see fig.6a ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath2c/@xmath1c values in table 3 are rewritten as log@xmath1c/@xmath2c in eighth column , and plotted against log@xmath5 in fig.6a , where log@xmath1c/@xmath2c shows a large scatter without clear dependence on the metallicity .",
    "this result shows a marked contrast to the plot of log@xmath6o/@xmath2c (= log@xmath7 from eighth column of table 1 ) against log@xmath5 , which shows a rather tight correlation with a higher ratio at the lower metallicity , as shown in fig.6b ( reproduced from fig.19 in paper iii ) .",
    "such a contrast between figs.6a and 6b can be a natural consequence that @xmath6o and @xmath2c are the primary products in the stellar nuclear synthesis while @xmath1c is the secondary product , at least partly ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the difference of the primary and secondary products in the actual distribution of the isotopes is clearly demonstrated for the first time .",
    "the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios of late - type dwarfs should reflect those of the ism from which the stars are formed .",
    "for comparison , the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in the ism have extensively been studied by the millimeter spectroscopy of giant molecular clouds .",
    "the initial results reviewed by @xcite show that there is no evidence for a @xmath2c/@xmath1c gradient in the galactic disk and the mean @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio is @xmath57 , except for the galactic center source showing @xmath2c/@xmath1c @xmath58 .",
    "however , later results reviewed by @xcite clearly indicated an increase of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio with the galactocentric distance @xmath59 : the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio is @xmath60 at @xmath61 4kpc and @xmath62 at @xmath63 8.5kpc ( near the sun ) .",
    "more recently , the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in the local ism ( within about 1 kpc of the sun ) have been determined from the optical spectroscopy of @xmath1ch@xmath64 absorption lines towards early type stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and a significant scatter of @xmath65 44  147 was found in the local ism .",
    "our result on the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in m dwarfs ( fig.6a ) shows more or less similar pattern to those in the ism outlined above .",
    "for example , the scatter of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio is quite large and extends from @xmath66 to @xmath67 both in the ism and in m dwarfs .",
    "also , such a low ratio as below 40 is not found both in the ism and in m dwarfs.c/@xmath1c @xmath68 for gj752b ( vb10 ) by @xcite , using spectra of @xmath69 or velocity resolution of 276kms@xmath12 .",
    "however , their resolution may be too low to justify their result , as the authors themselves noticed .",
    "] however , the results on the ism are on the present ism at the present locations while our results on m dwarfs may reflect the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios of the ism at various ages when m dwarfs were formed at different birthplaces . for this reason ,",
    "interpretation of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in m dwarfs should be more complicated than that in the ism .    as to the origin of @xmath1c",
    ", it is generally thought that @xmath1c is formed from @xmath2c originally present in the star at the time of its formation , and hence @xmath1c is regarded as a typical secondary element .",
    "then , @xmath1c can be produced in almost in all the stars in their hydrogen burning phase and will be dredged - up to the surface by the convective zone developed in the red giant phase ( and eventually to ism by stellar mass loss ) .",
    "however , the temperature at the base of the convective envelope after he shell flash can be high enough for cno cycle reactions take place ( hot bottom burning - hbb ) , and @xmath2c produced by the he burning can also be converted into @xmath1c .",
    "this @xmath1c is primary since it comes from the primary @xmath2c produced from he anew in the star @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the origin of @xmath1c in the galaxy is by no means well settled .",
    "the chemical evolution of @xmath2c/@xmath1c in the galaxy has been studied by assuming a mixed origin of primary and secondary ( case a ) or a purely secondary origin ( case b ) @xcite .",
    "their results show that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio decreases both in cases a and b during the evolution of the galaxy , and case a appears to explain somewhat better the present - day @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio if it is @xmath70 .",
    "our result that the mean value of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in m dwarfs is somewhat larger than that of the present ism , especially if we consider our result that many m dwarfs show @xmath2c/@xmath1c @xmath40 , is well consistent with the decrease of @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios as a result of chemical evolution of the ism outlined above . our result shown in fig.6 suggests that @xmath1c may be produced as the secondary product , at least partly , and since the secondary process depends on many factors including nuclear reactions , mixing , mass - loss , binarity etc in evolved stars , distribution of @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in the ism and hence in m dwarfs should be inhomogeneous .",
    "however , the mean @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio should decrease with time in the ism and hence in m dwarfs , resulting in a larger mean @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in m dwarfs than that in the present ism .",
    "the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in m dwarfs in table 3 and shown in fig.6a should reflect the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios of the ism from which m dwarfs were formed , and the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio of the ism itself has been determined by the mass - loss from the stars of the previous generation .",
    "it is not possible to know the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios of the stars of the previous generation , but we can study the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios of similar stars that might have contributed to the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios of m dwarf stars .",
    "for this purpose , the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in red giants , supergiants , and agb stars that have been studied by many authors as noted in section1 can be of some help .",
    "for example , if relatively large production of carbon in metal - rich era ( fig.6b ) is due to abg stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in unevolved stars as well as in the ism may be related to those of agb stars . however , it is not likely that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios observed in the present evolved stars can explain well the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio observed in the present ism as well as in m dwarfs .",
    "this should be because the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio could be determined only from molecular spectra and the isotopic ratios of many other objects not showing molecular spectra remain unexplored .",
    "for this reason , our knowledge on the distribution of isotopes in the universe is quite limited and imperfect .",
    "unfortunately , this fact makes it difficult to understand observationally the origin of the carbon isotopes in m dwarfs as well as in the ism .",
    "other sources of information on the isotopic composition in the universe are primitive meteorites containing grains of silicon carbide , graphite , diamond etc .",
    "direct analysis on these grains provides accurate isotopic compositions of celestial objects that have produced the grains , and it is no longer limited by the observability of molecular spectra .",
    "for example , @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio obtained from interstellar graphite shows a wide range from near the equilibrium value of the cn cycle to several thousands ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , the dynamic range of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in meteorite sample is much larger than in ism and in m dwarfs .",
    "we hope that these results can be incorporated into our understanding on the chemical evolution of isotopes , although it may be by no means easy to identify the origin of each grain .    ",
    "fig . 6 : p.15    ",
    "we have tried to estimate the carbon isotopic ratio @xmath2c/@xmath1c in m dwarfs based on the spectra of medium resolution ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "although this resolution is certainly not sufficient to resolve faint @xmath1c@xmath6o lines from the stronger lines of @xmath2c@xmath6o and h@xmath8o , we find clear evidence for the @xmath1c@xmath6o feature in the spectra of m dwarfs for the first time ( see fig.1 and figs.2a - l ) .",
    "then , determination of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in m dwarfs is quite feasible especially if higher spectral resolution can be employed , and we hope that the isotopic analysis on low luminosity stars such as m dwarfs will be done more intensively as in high luminosity cool stars .    with our medium resolution , we determine a possible best value of @xmath2c/@xmath1c in each m dwarf by comparing observed and predicted spectra , not by a direct inspection but by an application of the chi - square method .",
    "although the direct comparisons ( see figs.2a - l , 3a - f ) show difficulties inherent to the spectra of insufficient resolution , the chi - square analysis works reasonably well ( see fig.3 ) . as a result , we determine @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios for 31 m dwarfs and a lower limit of 200 for 17 m dwarfs . from our preliminary survey",
    ", we may suggest that the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in m dwarfs are larger than about 40 and not likely to be so small as in some evolved high luminosity stars . although the lower limit of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio is found to be 200 in many m dwarfs , this result is uncertain by a factor of two or so .",
    "unfortunately , it is beyond the capability of our medium resolution spectra to analyze faint features due to very low abundance of @xmath1c .",
    "we hope that our result can be improved by the use of higher spectral resolutions in the near future .",
    "the mean @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in m dwarfs turns out to be larger than that of the ism ( section5 ) . while the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in the ism provides the present @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio , that in m dwarfs reflects the carbon isotopic ratio in the past ism .",
    "so far , the solar system , conserving the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio of the ism 4.5 gyr ago , was used as a reference in investigating the time variation of the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio in the ism , but m dwarfs can in principle be used for the same purpose with numerous objects in a larger time - space domain .",
    "in fact , m dwarfs offer an unique possibility to determine the @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratios in unevolved late - type dwarfs and should have important role to trace the evolution of carbon isotopes ( and possibly other isotopes ) in the galaxy . for this reason",
    ", determination of isotopic abundances in m dwarfs should be the next major challenge when high resolution infrared spectroscopy will be ripe enough to be able to observe many faint objects not well observed so far .",
