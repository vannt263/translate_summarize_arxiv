    "squares and square roots of graphs form a classical and well - studied topic in graph theory , which has also attracted significant attention from the algorithms community .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is the _ square _ of a graph @xmath2 if @xmath0 and @xmath2 have the same vertex set , and two vertices are adjacent in @xmath0 if and only if the distance between them is at most @xmath1 in @xmath2 .",
    "this situation is denoted by @xmath3 , and @xmath2 is called a _ square root _ of @xmath0 . a square root of a graph need not be unique ; it might even not exist .",
    "there are graphs without square roots , graphs with a unique square root , and graphs with several different square roots .",
    "characterizing and recognizing graphs with square roots has therefore been an intriguing and important problem both in graph theory and in algorithms for decades .    already in 1967 ,",
    "mukhopadhyay  @xcite proved that a graph @xmath0 on vertex set @xmath4 has a square root if and only if @xmath0 contains complete subgraphs @xmath5 , such that each @xmath6 contains @xmath7 , and vertex @xmath8 belongs to @xmath6 if and only if @xmath7 belongs to @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , this characterization does not yield a polynomial - time algorithm for deciding whether @xmath0 has a square root .",
    "let us formally call square root the problem of deciding whether an input graph @xmath0 has a square root . in 1994",
    "it was shown by motwani and sudan  @xcite that square root is np - complete .",
    "motivated by its computational hardness , special cases of the problem have been studied , where the input graph @xmath0 belongs to a particular graph class . according to these results , square root is polynomial - time solvable on planar graphs  @xcite , and more generally , on every non - trivial minor - closed graph class  @xcite .",
    "polynomial - time algorithms exist also when the input graph @xmath0 belongs to one of the following graph classes : block graphs  @xcite , line graphs  @xcite , trivially perfect graphs  @xcite , threshold graphs  @xcite , graphs of maximum degree  6  @xcite , graphs of maximum average degree smaller than @xmath10  @xcite , graphs with clique number at most  3  @xcite , and graphs with bounded clique number and no long induced path  @xcite . on the negative side",
    ", it has been shown that square root is np - complete on chordal graphs  @xcite .",
    "a number of parameterized complexity results exist for the problem @xcite .",
    "more interesting from our perspective , the intractability of the problem has also been attacked by restricting the properties of the square root that we are looking for . in this case , the input graph @xmath0 is arbitrary , and the question is whether @xmath0 has a square root that belongs to some graph class  @xmath11 specified in advance .",
    "we denote this problem by @xmath12-square root , and this is exactly the problem variant that we focus on in this paper .",
    "significant advances have been made also in this direction .",
    "previous results show that @xmath11-square root is polynomial - time solvable for the following graph classes @xmath11 : trees  @xcite , proper interval graphs  @xcite , bipartite graphs  @xcite , block graphs  @xcite , strongly chordal split graphs  @xcite , ptolemaic graphs  @xcite , 3-sun - free split graphs  @xcite , cactus graphs  @xcite , and graphs with girth at least @xmath13 for any fixed @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the result for 3-sun - free split graphs has been extended to a number of other subclasses of split graphs in  @xcite .",
    "observe that if @xmath12-square root is polynomial - time solvable for some class  @xmath11 , then this does not automatically imply that @xmath15-square root is polynomial - time solvable for a subclass @xmath16 of  @xmath12 .    on the negative side ,",

    "all known np - hardness constructions involve dense graphs @xcite , and the square roots that occur in these constructions are dense as well .",
    "this , in combination with the listed polynomial - time cases , naturally leads to the question whether @xmath11-square root is polynomial - time solvable if the class @xmath12 is `` sparse '' in some sense .    motivated by the above , in this paper we study @xmath12-square root when @xmath12 is the class of outerplanar graphs , and when @xmath12 is the class of graphs of pathwidth at most @xmath1 . in both cases",
    ", we show that @xmath12-square root can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "in particular , we prove that outerplanar ( square ) root can be solved in time @xmath17 and ( square ) root of pathwidth @xmath18 in time @xmath19 .",
