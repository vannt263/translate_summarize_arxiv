    "recent neutrino experiments confirm that the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) @xcite lepton mixing matrix @xmath9 contains large mixing angles .",
    "for example the atmospheric mixing @xmath10 is compatible with @xmath11  @xcite , and the solar mixing @xmath12 is @xmath13  @xcite . these results should be compared with the third lepton mixing angle @xmath0 which is very small and even compatible with zero @xcite , and with the quark mixing angles in the @xmath14 matrix  @xcite .",
    "the disparity that nature indicates between quark and lepton mixing angles has been viewed in terms of a quark - lepton complementarity ( qlc ) @xcite which can be expressed in the relations _ 12^pmns+_12^ckm45^ ; _",
    "23^pmns+_23^ckm45^.    possible consequences of qlc have been investigated in the literature  @xcite and in particular a simple correspondence between the @xmath9 and @xmath14 matrices has been proposed  @xcite and analyzed in terms of a correlation matrix  @xcite . the correlation matrix @xmath1 is simply defined as the product of the ckm and pmns matrices , @xmath15 , and efforts have been done to obtain the _ most favorite _ pattern for the matrix @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "unitarity then implies @xmath16 and one may ask where do the large lepton mixings come from ?",
    "is this information implicit in the form of the @xmath1 matrix ?",
    "this question has been widely investigated in the literature , but its answer is still open ( see our section * 2 * ) .",
    "furthermore in some grand unification theories ( guts ) the direct qlc correlation between the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 mixing matrix can be obtained . in this class of models ,",
    "the @xmath1 matrix is determined by the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix  @xcite .",
    "moreover as long as quarks and leptons are inserted in the same representation of the underlying gauge group , we need to include in our definition of @xmath1 arbitrary but non trivial phases between the quark and lepton matrices .",
    "hence we will generalize the relation @xmath15 to @xmath19 where the quantity @xmath20 is a diagonal matrix @xmath21 and the three phases @xmath22 are free parameters ( in the sense that they are not restricted by present experimental evidence ) .",
    "the magnitude disparity between the lepton mixing angle @xmath0 and the other two mixings is a rather striking fact . in this paper",
    "we carry out the investigation of the correlation matrix @xmath1 based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : fund ] ) and prove that it is a zero texture of @xmath1 , namely @xmath23 , that implies a small value for @xmath0 with a sharp prediction @xmath24 we use the wolfenstein parameterization for @xmath14 @xcite in its unitary form  @xcite and parameterize @xmath9 with the standard phases and mixing angles . as a zero order approximation",
    "we start inserting by hand the central values of the lepton mixing angles and ckm parameters . owing to the uncertainty in the experimental value for @xmath0 , the possible range for the ( 1,3 ) entry of matrix @xmath1 may or may not include zero",
    ". for example using @xmath25 the ( 1,3 ) entry range does not include zero in accordance with eq .",
    "( 23 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . for other choices of @xmath0",
    "a vanishing ( 1,3 ) entry is quite possible , as will be seen in section  * [ sec : vm]*.    it is possible to include bimaximal and tribimaximal forms of the correlation matrix @xmath1 in models with renormalization effects  @xcite that are relevant , however , only in particular cases with large @xmath26 @xmath27 and with quasi degenerate neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion for matrix @xmath1 is that the possibility of a bimaximal form , or a tribimaximal one is completely open . so in other words , the correlation between the matrices @xmath14 and @xmath9 is rather nontrivial .",
    "the investigation we perform for the @xmath1 matrix starts from the fundamental equation @xmath28 and uses the experimental ranges and constraints on lepton mixing angles .",
    "we resort to a monte carlo simulation with two - sided gaussian distributions around the mean values of the observables .",
    "the input information on @xmath0 is taken from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite which uses neutrino data only .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  * [ sec : vm ] * we study the numerical ranges of @xmath1 entries with the aid of a monte carlo simulation , emphasizing on specific points of the experimental data .",
    "we will show that the vanishing of the @xmath29 entry is favored by the data analysis . in section  * [ sec : pmns ] * we present the matter from a different point of view : we start from a zero @xmath29 @xmath1 entry ( e.g. a bimaximal or tribimaximal matrix ) we derive the consequent prediction for the @xmath9 lepton mixing matrix through u_pmns=(u_ckm)^-1v_m and the corresponding one for @xmath0 in eq .  ( [ eq : prediction ] )",
    ". finally we present a summary and our conclusions .",
    "in this section we investigate the order of magnitude of the @xmath1 matrix entries concentrating in particular in the ( 1,3 ) entry and the important mixing angle @xmath30 to which it is directly related .",
    "we then explicitly study the allowed values of the @xmath1 angles , finally concluding that @xmath31 is the value most favored by the data .",
    "we will be using the wolfenstein parameterization @xcite of the @xmath14 matrix in its unitary form @xcite where one has the relation [ ckm ] _",
    "12^ckm=_23^ckm = a^2 _ 13^ckme^-^ckm = a ^3(- ) to all orders in @xmath32 .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix @xmath9 is parameterized in the usual way as u_pmns= u_23u_13^u_12_m . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are diagonal matrices containing the dirac and majorana cp violating phases , respectively @xmath35 and @xmath36 , so that [ pmns ] u_pmns=      in grand unification models where quarks and leptons belong to the same representation of the gauge group , the quark and lepton fields must acquire different phases once their symmetry is broken . hence one should take into account this phase mismatch at low energy associated with the form of the ckm and pmns matrices ( [ ckm ] ,  [ pmns ] ) . to this end",
    "we introduced the diagonal matrix @xmath20 [ omega ] = diag(e^_1,e^_2,e^_3 ) in the commonly used relation @xmath37 .",
    "this is therefore generalized to [ eq : thvm ] v_m&=&u_ckmu_pmns .",
    "we use for the observed ckm mixing parameters the values @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and for the pmns mixing angles the values @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath25  @xcite . for the @xmath20 phases we resort a monte carlo simulation with flat distributions in the interval @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "we then get the following range of values for the elements of the @xmath1 correlation matrix : [ eq : xing ] v_m= (      ) .",
    "these values are in good agreement with  @xcite .",
    "the small differences are due to the fact that we use the full mixing matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ ckm ] ) and not the parameterization given in eq .",
    "( 21 ) of ref .",
    "notice that the @xmath29 entry of the matrix @xmath1 above can not be zero , so @xmath1 can not be bimaximal , i.e. of the form , nor tribimaximal , namely , where only the absolute values have been considered .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xing ] ) however depends on the assumption about the values used for the mixing angles . for example if we use a different value for @xmath0 , namely @xmath45 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite or our eq .",
    "( [ bestfit2 ] ) for the allowed range of @xmath0 ) , we get v_m= (      ) . for these values",
    "the result is in agreement with the statement that @xmath1 has the @xmath29 entry equal to zero .",
    "it is clear that we need a better investigation of the situation before establishing what are the allowed values of the entries of the correlation matrix @xmath1 that can be deduced from the experimental data .",
    "we next investigate the important entry @xmath29 as it overwhelmingly affects the @xmath0 prediction as will be seen in section  * [ sec : pmns]*.      at first non trivial orders in @xmath32 we have [ th13vm_a ] ^2_13^v_m&= & |(1- ) e^(_1 -_2- ) _ 13^pmns+_23^pmns _ 13^pmns + o(^3)|^2 it is seen from this expression that the first two terms can cancel each other implying a vanishing @xmath29 entry of the @xmath1 matrix . in order to better investigate this issue we plot in fig.[fig : f1 ] the quantity @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "all other observables are fixed at their best fit points @xcite and we allowed the dirac lepton phase @xmath50 , the majorana ones @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the unphysical phases of @xmath20 to vary in the interval @xmath53 $ ] with a flat distribution .",
    "as shown in the figure , for the central value of @xmath0 given in  @xcite the entry ( 1,3 ) of @xmath1 can not be zero .",
    "however there is a small region @xmath54 for which @xmath55 can be zero .",
    "this fact has the very important consequence of providing a sharp prediction for the unknown mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "we will investigate this point in detail in the section  * [ sec : pmns]*.    [ [ sec : thetavm ] ] the allowed values for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath48 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    here we further investigate the possibility of @xmath1 to be bimaximal or tribimaximal using the fundamental equation  ( [ eq : thvm ] ) .",
