    "in just the united states each year approximately 795.000 people are affected by stroke @xcite . in france strokes",
    "are around 150.000 each year @xcite .",
    "similar trends are shown all around the industrialized world .",
    "a stroke can cause disabilities , such as paralysis , speech difficulties , and emotional problems .",
    "these disabilities can significantly affect the quality of daily life for survivors .",
    "several researchers on the field have shown that important variables in relearning motor skills and in changing the underlying neural architecture after a stroke are the quantity , duration , and intensity of training sessions ( for more information see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we present a mixed reality approach for upper limb rehabilitation focused to increase quantity , duration , and quality of training sessions .",
    "in particular the approach answers the following challenges : ( i ) increase motivation of patients by making the training a personalized experience , for example adjusting exercises difficulty according to patients cognitive and physical capabilities ; ( ii ) take into account patients impairments by offering intuitive and easy to use interaction modalities that do not require a learning curve and that are adapted to elder people ; ( iii ) make it possible to therapists to track patient s activities and evaluate progress in order to adapt therapeutic strategies ; ( iv ) open opportunities for telemedicine and tele rehabilitation when patients leave the hospital ; ( v ) provide an economically acceptable system by reducing both equipment and management costs .",
    "it is worth to note that the above mentioned issues address two targets : the therapist and the patient .",
    "it is our opinion that it is important to evaluate acceptance of these systems from both , the patient s point of view and the therapists point of view .",
    "otherwise , even if clinical efficiency is demonstrated , developed systems will be used only for academic studies and may not be widely accepted in real rehabilitation centers . for this reason , before testing the system directly with patients we decide to conduct a pilot study in conjunction with a french hospital .",
    "aim of this pilot was understand the potential and benefits of mixed reality from the therapist s point of view .",
    "the pilot involved 3 therapists who played the role of patients .",
    "three sessions , one using conventional rehabilitation , another using an ad hoc developed game on a pc , and another using a mixed reality version of the same game were held . before entering in detail into the pilot study description , in following subsections we will describe in more depth what a stroke is and what are its consequences , and why a virtual approach could be useful for such a rehabilitation .      after a stroke",
    "there is a loss of brain functions due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain .",
    "the affected area of the brain is unable to function , leading to inability to move one or more limbs on one side of the body and perhaps to cognitive problems such aphasia or the so - called neglect effect . because of these impairments stroke sufferers are often unable to independently perform day - to - day activities such as bathing , dressing , and eating .",
    "nearly three - quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65 .",
    "the specific abilities that will be lost or affected by stroke depend on the extent of the brain damage and most importantly where in the brain the stroke occurred .",
    "for example , a stroke in the right hemisphere often causes paralysis in the left side of the body .",
    "this is known as left hemiplegia .",
    "survivors of right - hemisphere strokes may have problems with their spatial and perceptual abilities .",
    "this may cause them to misjudge distances ( leading to a fall ) or be unable to guide their hands to pick up an object , button a shirt or tie their shoes .",
    "they may even be unable to tell right - side up from upside - down when trying to read .",
    "survivors of right - hemisphere strokes may also experience left - sided neglect . stemming from visual field impairments ,",
    "left - sided neglect causes the survivor of a right - hemisphere stroke to forget or ignore objects or people on their left side . on the other hand ,",
    "someone who has had a left - hemisphere stroke may develop aphasia .",
    "aphasia is a catch - all term used to describe a wide range of speech and language problems .",
    "these problems can be highly specific , affecting only one component of the patient s ability to communicate , such as the ability to move their speech - related muscles to talk properly",
    ". the same patient may be completely unimpaired when it comes to writing , reading or understanding speech .",
    "by contrast to survivors of right - hemisphere stroke , patients who have had a left - hemisphere stroke often develop a slow and cautious behavioral style .",
    "they may need frequent instruction and feedback to complete tasks ( information from the * ? ? ?",
    "as we can see from these two examples , the consequences of two stroke accidents could be deeply different .",
    "for this reason each stroke rehabilitation program is personal , designed for a particular patient , and not a generic one .      in stroke accidents rehabilitation",
    "involves intensive and continuous training to regain as much function as possible , depending on several factors including the severity of brain lesions and the degree of cerebral plasticity .",
    "following the hypothesis that the theories of motor learning can be applied on motor relearning most rehabilitation techniques are founded on principles of motor learning and skill acquisition established for the healthy nervous system .",
    "acknowledged features are among others : ( i ) the motivation of the participant ; ( ii ) the use of variable practice ( i.e. practice a variety of related tasks ) ; ( iii ) training with high intensity / many repetitions ; ( iv ) and providing feedback @xcite .",
    "in addition , therapy on the lower extremity ( i.e. , legs ) is the primary concern in early inpatient stroke therapy in order to enable mobility of the patient .",
    "recovery of the upper extremity ( i.e. , arms ) has a slower progression and is usually gained through outpatient and home therapy @xcite .",
    "patients with upper extremity paralysis typically regain motion starting from their shoulder . over time",
    ", they may gradually regain motion in the elbow , wrist , and , finally , the hand .",
    "the most important part of stroke rehabilitation is conducted during the first 6 months after the stroke and due to the cost , only 6/8 weeks of rehabilitation is done under the continued direct supervision of an expert ( i.e. , in the hospital ) . because of limitations on therapy patients must do much of the work necessary to recover arm function at home .    to summarize , after a stroke the affected area of the brain is unable to function , leading to inability to move one or more limbs on one side of the body and also perhaps to cognitive problems such aphasia or the so - called neglect effect .",
    "as a result of these impairments stroke sufferers are often unable to independently perform day - to - day activities such as bathing , dressing , and eating .",
    "as a side effect they can develop depression or aggressiveness due to the trauma of reduced capabilities . depression and aggressiveness",
    "also imply that stroke survivors may find it difficult to focus on a therapy programme .",
    "in addition , while these programmes attempt to stimulate the patient with a variety of rehabilitation exercises , stroke victims commonly report that traditional rehabilitation tasks can be boring due to their repetitive nature .",
    "we can then say that motivation is an important factor for rehabilitation success .",
    "several researchers have shown , both in animal and human , that important variables in relearning motor skills and in changing the underlying neural architecture are the quantity , duration , and intensity of training sessions .",
    "in particular , research in animal models suggests that with intensive therapy ( repeating individual motions hundreds of times per day ) , animals that experience strokes can recover a significant amount of their lost motor control @xcite .",
    "similarly , recent guidelines for treatment of human patients recommend high - intensity , repetitive motions while keeping patients informed about their progress @xcite .",
    "looking at the effects of different intensities of physical therapy treatment , several authors @xcite have reported significant improvement in activities of daily living as a result of higher intensities of treatment .    to experience significant recovery",
    ", stroke patients must perform a substantial number of daily exercises .",
    "unfortunately , typical sessions with therapists include a relatively small number of motions @xcite .",
    "one of the possible solutions is doing rehabilitation at home .",
    "however , while therapists prescribe a home exercise regimen for most patients , a study indicates only 31% of patients actually perform these exercises as recommended @xcite .",
    "thus , home based stroke rehabilitation has the potential to help patients in recovering from a stroke . on the other hand",
    "a main problem arises when choosing which kind of home - based technology can both help and motivate patients to perform therapeutic exercises .",
    "the challenge for post stroke rehabilitation is to create exercises able to decrease monotony of hundreds of repeated motions . in order to overcome the above mentioned problems different kinds of non traditional therapies",
    "have been proposed .",
    "for example , the possibility of using virtual rehabilitation has been the subject of experiments by several authors ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "although most of studies on this topic are linked to the study of virtual reality environments recent studies have focused on the use of videogames and consoles for rehabilitation ( such as @xcite .",
    "results of these studies can be summerized as follows :    1 .",
    "_ personalization _ : virtual rehabilitation technology creates an environment in which the intensity of feedback and training can be systematically manipulated and enhanced in order to create the most appropriate , individualized motor learning paradigm @xcite .",
    "rehabilitation using games can take advantage of the use of adaptation in order to create ad hoc personalized games",
    "_ interactivity _ : an advantage present in all forms of virtual rehabilitation is the use of interactivity .",
    "for example it has been suggested that integrating gaming features in virtual environments for rehabilitation could enhance user motivation .",
    "virtual rehabilitation exercises can be made to be engaging , such that the patient feels immersed in the simulated world .",
    "this is extremely important in terms of the patient motivation @xcite , which , in turn , is key to recovery . a person who enjoys what he is doing spends more time developing her skills in a given activity .",
    "feedback _ : interactive feedback can contribute to motivation .",
    "for example , by providing visual and auditory rewards , such as displaying gratifying messages in real time , patients are motivated to exercise @xcite 4 .   _",
    "tracking _ : the evolution of the patient s performance can be easily stored , accessed and developed without the patient s or therapist s input .",
    "in addition , the internet can be used for data transfer , allowing a therapist to remotely monitor progress and to modify the patient s therapy program @xcite .",
    "_ telerehabilitation _ : virtual rehabilitation can stimulate the patient using a variety of rehabilitation exercises at a low cost .",
    "this means that rehabilitation costs can be contained if the technology used for virtual rehabilitation ( consoles and games ) is easily accessible .",
    "in addition lower cost personal equipment ( for example pc - based ) will eventually allow rehabilitation stations to be placed in locations other than the rehabilitation center , such as a patient s home .",
    "on the other hand , virtual rehabilitation raises important challenges that may limit its widespread adoption such as :    * clinical acceptance , which relies on proved medical efficacy * therapist s attitude towards the technology ( e.g. , the therapist agrees that technology is able to replace therapists and the like ) * patient s attitude towards the technology ( e.g. , the patient may not consider a game to be real rehabilitation ) .",
    "* challenges linked to the kind of technology used ( challenges differ from virtual reality to consoles ) .      in order to overcome the last three challenges we propose an approach based on mixed reality ( see section [ sytems ] of this paper for the description of such a system )",
    ". however , while evaluating usability for systems has become a standard @xcite attitude is a more complex element which requires an in depth assessment .",
    "for this reason we propose to use an approach meant to evaluate acceptance of a tool based on shackel .",
    "shackel @xcite defines a model where product acceptance is the highest concept .",
    "the user has to make a trade off between utility , the match between user s needs and functionality , usability , ability to use functionality in practice and likeability , affective evaluation vs costs ( see fig.[fig : shackel ] )        it is worth noting that in a system for stroke rehabilitation we are dealing with two kind of acceptances .",
    "the first one is patient s acceptance of the system . in order to be accepted by our users the system has to be considered usable , useful and likeable .",
    "the second one is therapist s acceptance .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned elements the system has also to show adequate cost for the therapist .",
    "while in this paper we address directly the therapist acceptance and the patient s perspective only as a simulate one ( see section [ protocol ] ) it s our opinion that both perspectives are very important .",
    "this section reviews existing approaches for post stroke rehabilitation .",
    "the presentation of works is not exhaustive and the focus has been made on three types of rehabilitation systems : robot based system , virtual reality based systems and mixed reality based systems . besides , only early stages of rehabilitation have been considered which excluded for instance system dedicated to the rehabilitation of fingers such as @xcite .    to avoid ambiguities , hereafter definition of each type of system",
    "is given .",
    "[ [ definition - of - virtual - reality ] ] definition of virtual reality + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    virtual reality system is commonly defined as an environment that can simulate real world situations and allows users to interact within this simulated environment using different types of devices such as head mounted device ( hmd ) and gloves .",
    "[ [ definition - of - mixed - reality ] ] definition of mixed reality + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    mixed reality system merges real and virtual worlds to create a new context of interaction where both physical and digital objects co - exist and interact consistently in real time .",
    "this contrasts with virtual reality where the interaction is directional from the physical world where the user is situated towards the virtual environment where the interaction holds . within mixed reality system ,",
    "the interaction holds among objects of both virtual and physical environments .",
    "a classical example of a mixed reality game is the mr pong @xcite where players play pong game with a virtual ball colliding with physical objects on a table .",
    "[ [ definition - of - robot - assisted - rehabilitation ] ] definition of robot assisted rehabilitation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    robot based rehabilitation uses a training robot .",
    "the robot complements or induces patient s movement and provides feedback .",
    "robot systems are often coupled with a computer program used to create virtual context for actions and delivering a visual feedback .",
    "an evaluation framework is used to analyze usability of each system from therapist , patient and financier point of view .      from the therapist s point of view ,",
    "we are interested by the following evaluation criteria :    [ [ therapist - intervention ] ] therapist intervention + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this criterion informs whether the therapist can intervene during the rehabilitation sessions .",
    "in fact , we have noticed from observations and preliminary interviews with therapists the importance of assistance and guidance delivered by the therapist .",
    "the therapist has to intervene physically during the rehabilitation sessions to support the patient and to prevent him from developing incorrect compensating gestures such as chest balancing .",
    "possible values of this criterion are : yes , if the therapist can intervene and no , otherwise .",
    "[ [ changes - on - therapist - habits ] ] changes on therapist habits + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this criterion informs about changes induced by introduction of the rehabilitation system to therapist working habits .",
    "the introduction of a new rehabilitation system may induce changes in the way therapists were conducting therapeutic sessions .",
    "the goal of this criterion is to evaluate the amount of the induced changes .",
    "possible values are : negligible , if the therapists has not to change , her usual way of work ; moderate , when the therapist has to change some of her working habits and important , when the therapist has to change her way of conducting therapies .",
    "[ [ system - setup ] ] system setup + + + + + + + + + + + +    this criterion informs about the setup phase of the system .",
    "often , the rehabilitation system needs some setup phase in order to get devices installed and configured correctly before starting rehabilitation sessions .",
    "this criterion informs whether the therapist alone can perform this setup phase or a specialized assistant is required to setup the system .",
    "possible values of this criterion are : therapist , if the therapist could perform the setup phase and assistant , if intervention of a specialized technician is required .",
    "[ [ location ] ] location + + + + + + + +    this criterion concerns the place where the rehabilitation sessions can be performed .",
    "in fact , for some systems such as robot based systems and some virtual reality simulators a special room has to be dedicated to perform rehabilitation sessions .",
    "other lightweight systems do not require a fixed infrastructure and can be used almost anywhere .      from the patient s point of view",
    ", we are interested in two evaluation criteria that are :    [ [ eye - hand - focus ] ] eye - hand focus + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    observations from therapeutic sessions and interviews with therapists have revealed an important point related to the interaction of the patient with the system .",
    "in fact , post stroke patients during early stages may be reluctant to any system that requires an important cognitive effort . ideally , the attention of the patient has to be attracted and focused on a single point .",
    "for instance , when given a mouse patients look at their hand when trying to move and not to the screen .",
    "consequently , they find it difficult to follow two actions at the same time : the hand that is moving and the game displayed on the screen .",
    "this criterion evaluates whether the eye and hand of the patient are attracted to the same place or to different places .",
    "possible values for this criterion are : same place , when the hand and eyes of the patient are directed to the same place and different places , when the hand and eyes of the patient are attracted to different spaces .",
    "[ [ invasiveness - of - the - system ] ] invasiveness of the system + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this criterion informs about the invasiveness of the system from the patient s perspective .",
    "in fact , systems may require the patient to wear special devices to track their movement or to deliverer feedback .",
    "these devices are more or less convenient to wear and to tolerate by patients especially the ones that suffer from impairment and muscular spasticity",
    ". possible values for this criterion are : convenient , if the system is considered as convenient to use ; invasive , if the system is considered as interfering with the patient .      for a rehabilitation system to be used in rehabilitation centers ,",
    "it is necessary to demonstrate its medical efficiency and also to show that the system is economically sustainable .",
    "the economical aspect of the rehabilitation system are evaluated through two criteria that are :    [ [ unitary - cost - of - the - system ] ] unitary cost of the system + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this criterion evaluates the unitary cost of the system in kilo euros ( ke ) .",
    "the objective is not to deliver a precise price , but evaluate an order of magnitude of each system cost .",
    "thus , possible values of this criterion are : less than 1 ke per unit , 1 - 5 ke per unit , 5 - 10 ke per unit , and more than 10 ke per unit .    [",
    "[ extra - required - resources ] ] extra required resources + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    while the previous criterion estimates the unitary cost of the system , this criterion evaluates all extra resources that must provided for running the system such as recruiting specialized personnel , making available a special and so on .",
    "robot based approach for rehabilitation has been used since the late 90s to assist patients .",
    "the manus robot developed at the mit @xcite is an exemplar system ( figure [ fig : manus ] ) . in this system",
    "the patient is in front of the robot and her shoulder is strapped to a chair . the patient s impaired arm is strapped to a wrist carrier and attached to the manipulandum .",
    "a video screen is above the training table to create a virtual context for movements and provide visual feedbacks to the patients .",
    "several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of robots based rehabilitation when compared to classical therapies .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it has been demonstrated that robot - assisted therapy improved outcomes for long period of training when compared with usual care .",
    "[ tab : theraper ]    .therapist perspective [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         always in their patient s role therapist were asked to answer the following question : `` in general , which therapy did you preferred to do ?",
    "( classify exercises in order of preference ) '' .",
    "this means that we asked them to order the therapies as they thought the patients will do .",
    "all the three gave the following order : 1)mixed reality game , 2)pc game , 3)physical therapy .",
    "hereafter the results of the therapists questionnaire ( without any order and with duplicates ) .",
    "in synthesis they were asked as therapists to list the most negative and positive aspects of all the used systems .    _ list of the most negative aspect(s ) _ : + for the pc game : + - the patient had to look at the screen while playing + - the patient had to grab the mouse + - the fact to use only the upper part of the triangle was upsetting ( here the therapist is referring to the game ) + - the screen was small + - it s difficult for the patient to move the mouse + - it s difficult for the patient to use the mouse + for the mr game : + - it takes more time to start up ( here the therapist is referring to the system / wii calibration ) + for classical therapy : + - tiresome and painful + - motivation is low + - the patient has to confront with his own limitation    _ list the most positive aspect(s ) _ : + for the pc game : + - games are fun + - the patient can forget his environment + - different and may be funny    for the mr game : + - accessible .",
    "you can use whatever surface you want ( for example a table ) + - not so difficult to use as in the mouse case + - less material needed once started + none of the therapists gave particular comments on the classical therapy .",
    "finally , as therapists they had to answer the following question : `` in general , which therapy did you preferred to do ?",
    "( classify exercises in order of preference ) '' .",
    "this time they were thus asked their own preferences on the therapies . all the three gave the following order : 1)mixed reality game , 2)pc game , 3)physical therapy .",
    "as described in section [ methods ] the main goal of the experiment is to compare a mixed reality system ( mrs ) with two alternative single - user tools through an pilot study .",
    "the two alternative tools were classical physical rehabilitation and an ad - hoc post stroke pc game .",
    "we expected the mrs and the pc game to be more accepted  in shackel s sense @xcite  than classical rehabilitation when therapists are playing the patient role .",
    "the mrs easiness of use is also expected to be higher than the pc one .",
    "we are then analyzing perceived utility , usability , likeability ( affective evaluation ) ( see figure [ fig : shackel ] )    it is important to note that this is a pilot study involving a limited number of participants ( @xmath0 ) to prepare a larger scale experiment .",
    "consequently , quantitative data are presented as a support for discussion and no statistically valid generalizations could be inferred at this stage .",
    "as we can see from figure [ fig : graph ] elements linked to the environment oblivion ( immersion and flow ) have different ratings .",
    "flow is rated low for classical rehabilitation ( @xmath1 ) while pc ( @xmath2 ) and mixed reality ( @xmath3 ) have higher scores .",
    "sensory and imaginative immersion ratings are definitely lower for classical rehabilitation ( @xmath4 ) , next comes pc ( @xmath5 ) and finally mixed reality ( @xmath6 )    we can conclude that within the context of this experiment , both mrs and pc have been considered as more immersive , followed by classical therapy .",
    "this is an expected result since it is already known that using games for rehabilitation creates a sense of meaningfulness for repeated movements and encourages flow experience by forgetting everything around and being focused only on the task to be performed @xcite .",
    "lack of tension is an element characterizing tiredness and boringness .",
    "results show that this component is almost similar for pc , mrs and classical therapy with respectively ( @xmath7 ) , ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "so , within the context of this experiment all systems have been considered equivalent in terms of tiredness and boringness .",
    "when asked about this point , therapists highlight the fact that post stroke rehabilitation demands a lot of effort from the patient .",
    "so , game based rehabilitation can facilitate , to some extent , the context of rehabilitation but patients will sooner or later show fatigue and pain and the therapeutic session has to stop .",
    "if we look at negative affects , pc ( @xmath10 ) is the one rating lower , followed by mixed reality ( @xmath11 ) and the classical therapy ( @xmath12 ) is the one rated with higher negative affect .",
    "when asked qualitatively about this fact , therapists mentioned the problem of exertion when using mrs .",
    "in fact , there is a one to one mapping of patient movements between the physical and virtual world .",
    "so the scaling and artificial compensation of movements is not possible as it could be performed within a virtual environment by changing speed and sensitivity of the pointing device for instance .",
    "this was considered as a very interesting remark that we were not aware of before conducting the study .",
    "consequently , within mrs the exertion of the patient is an important challenge to take into account and innovative solutions have to be provided to compensate patient s limited movement such as modifying dynamically size of objects or moving objects closer to patient when she is stuck .",
    "what is very interesting is that while mr is seen as a possible cause of moderately negative affects , it is rated as the systems with the higher positive affects ( ( @xmath13 ) for mr ; ( @xmath14 ) for pc ; ( @xmath15 ) for classical therapy )    this reinforces the idea that mr has the potential to increase the volume of rehabilitation by increasing the exercises they do .",
    "however , as said previously , this should be done while taking in account patient s exertion .    finally , competences and challenges are rated in a very similar way .",
    "this means that the effort the patient had to put to understand and perform exercises was the same .    to summarize , when playing the role of patients , therapists",
    "have considered :    * that pc , mrs and classical therapy were equivalent on competence , tension and challenge components . *",
    "both pc and mrs systems are better than classical therapy on immersion , flow , negative affect and positive affects . *",
    "mrs has been considered as worse than pc on negative affect due to worries expressed on fatigue .",
    "if we switch to the therapists questionnaire we can describe why the mrs has a higher potential to be accepted by patients .",
    "in fact , one of the most underlined problems with pc rehabilitation was the use of the mouse as a pointing device .",
    "this limitation becomes one of potentiality of mrs ( see the comment : not difficult to use as in the mouse case ) .",
    "in addition , comments on pc usage are also related to limitations about screen dimension .",
    "finally the most interesting comment is linked to the fact that the patients have to look in another place ( the pc screen ) in order to perform the task .",
    "this could be a great problem when using this kind of device on some patients .",
    "the mrs on the other hand can project on any surface .",
    "finally it is interesting to note that all three subjects gave the same order of preferences : ( 1 ) mrs , ( 2 ) pc , ( 3 ) classical therapy both as patients and as therapists .",
    "objective of this paper was to present a mixed reality system ( mrs ) for rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke .",
    "the system answers the following challenges : ( i ) increase motivation of patients by making the training a personalized experience ( ii ) take into account patients impairments by offering intuitive and easy to use interaction modalities ( iii ) make it possible to therapists to track patient s activities and to evaluate / track patient s progress ( iv ) open opportunities to telemedicine and tele rehabilitation ( v ) provide an economically acceptable system by reducing both equipment and management costs .",
    "it s our opinion that it is important to evaluate the acceptance of these systems not only from the the patient s point of view but also from therapists point of view .",
    "we decide then to test this system wih therapists in a pilot study conducted in conjunction with a french hospital .",
    "the main assumption behind this experiment was that , even if clinical efficiency is demonstrated , if therapist does not accept the system it will be used only for academic studies and may not be widely accepted in real rehabilitation centers .",
    "the pilot described in this paper involved 3 therapists who played the role of patients .",
    "the main idea was that , because of the years they spent with patients , they are able to simulate patients reactions to the system .",
    "three sessions , one using conventional rehabilitation , another using an ad hoc developed game on a pc , and another using a mixed reality version of the same game were held .",
    "we expected the mrs and the pc game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation by the therapists in the patient s role(h1 ) , and mrs easiness of use to be considered higher than the pc one(h2 ) .",
    "results shows that while the effort the patient has to put in the exercises was practically the same for all the systems , mixed reality can be a mean to help patients to forget exertion and potentially augment the number of exercises they do .",
    "we can say that mixed reality and pc games requires the same amount of effort than classical rehabilitation .",
    "however , because of the characteristics of mixed reality and pc games we can suppose that patients will prefer to use this two systems with a preference for the mrs ( h2 ) .",
    "in addition , analyzing the therapists questionnaire we can say that the mixed reality system has a higher potential to be accepted by patients ( h1 ) .",
    "in fact , one of the most underlined problems with pc rehabilitation was the use of a mouse as a device .",
    "this limitation becomes one of potentiality of mixed reality .",
    "in addition the mrs can be project in whatever surface and avoid the problem to look in a place and perform the task in another .",
    "the pilot study described in this paper was not intended to deliver statistical evidence , but simply to give approximate values guiding the set - up of following experiments .",
    "for this reason we scheduled two more experiments .",
    "the first one is an in depth version of the pilot study presented in this paper . for this experiment",
    "we want to gather a greater number of data using the same role playing protocol .",
    "the second one will drop the role playing and will analyze actual stroke rehabilitation of the upper limb with patients and therapists each in they own role .",
    "the main idea behind this two experiment is to compare results from the two in order to understand the discrepancy between patients attitudes and therapists expectations towards the system .",

    "<S> the objective of this paper is to present a mixed reality system ( mrs ) for rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke . </S>",
    "<S> the system answers the following challenges : ( i ) increase motivation of patients by making the training a personalized experience ; ( ii ) take into account patients impairments by offering intuitive and easy to use interaction modalities ; ( iii ) make it possible to therapists to track patient s activities and to evaluate / track their progress ; ( iv ) open opportunities for telemedicine and tele rehabilitation ; ( v ) and provide an economically acceptable system by reducing both equipment and management costs . in order to test this system </S>",
    "<S> a pilot study has been conducted in conjunction with a french hospital in order to understand the potential and benefits of mixed reality . </S>",
    "<S> the pilot involved 3 therapists who played the role of patients . </S>",
    "<S> three sessions , one using conventional rehabilitation , another using an ad hoc developed game on a pc , and another using a mixed reality version of the same game were held . </S>",
    "<S> results have shown the mrs and the pc game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation .    </S>",
    "<S> mixed reality , post stroke rehabilitation , serious games </S>"
