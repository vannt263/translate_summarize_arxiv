    "am her stars , or polars , are the subclass of cataclysmic binaries in which the white dwarf is highly magnetized , typically @xmath2  mg , and roche - lobe overflow from a low - mass companion proceeds through an accretion stream directly onto the magnetic pole(s ) of the white dwarf without the intermediary of an accretion disk . the magnetic field in polars is also strong enough to synchronize the rotation of the white dwarf with the orbital period of the system .",
    "hard x - rays are produced by bremsstrahlung from the hot gas which is heated by an accretion shock above the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "soft x - ray / euv radiation is powered by reprocessing of the hard x - rays on the surface , and also by direct heating of the subphotospheric layers by dense blobs raining down from the accretion stream .",
    "most of the known am her stars were discovered because of their x - ray radiation . for reviews ,",
    "see cropper ( 1990 ) and beuermann & burwitz ( 1995 ) .",
    "this is the third in a series of papers which demonstrate the value of long _ euve _",
    "observations for obtaining interesting timing results on more than one source in the field ( see halpern , martin , & marshall 1996 ; halpern & marshall 1996 ) .",
    "we began a long _ euve _ observation of the seyfert galaxy 1h  0419577 ( @xmath3 ) on 1997 december 15 .",
    "it was immediately apparent in quick - look data that a _ pair _ of sources of equal brightness was present near the target position .",
    "only @xmath1 apart , they are nevertheless well separated in the _ euve _ deep survey imager .",
    "this instrument is sensitive in the range 65190 ev , although interstellar absorption limits the detected flux from extragalactic sources to energies greater than 100  ev .",
    "figure  1 shows the light curves of both sources , where each point represents one satellite orbit . in order to construct these light curves ,",
    "counts were extracted from a circular aperture of radius @xmath4 around each source .",
    "background was obtained from adjacent regions and subtracted , and the light curves were corrected for variable dead time and `` primbsching '' ( lost counts due to telemetry sharing ) .",
    "the total exposure time is 651,405  s , and the net counts are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , from the seyfert galaxy 1h  0419577 and the new source denoted euve j0425.65714 .",
    "table  1 contains a log of this observation .",
    "-0.3 truein    while the seyfert galaxy is only moderately variable , the new source shows large - amplitude modulation which is the result of the beating between the _ euve _ satellite orbit ( 94.6  min ) and the intrinsic variability of the source .",
    "the latter was determined unambiguously to be a @xmath7  min coherent period both from epoch folding ( chi - square ) analysis , and from a discrete fourier transform of the individual photon arrival times .",
    "the fact that the light curves of the two sources in figure  1 do not show correlated variability assures us that the periodic signal detected in euve j0425.65714 is real , and not the result of some unknown systematic effect .",
    "we interpret the 85.822  min period as both the orbital period and the spin period of a synchronously rotating magnetic cv ( see  4 ) .",
    "we searched for additional periods as short as 10  s , but none were found .",

    "the hri is sensitive in the range 0.22.0  kev .",
    "this source was not detected in the only _ rosat _ pspc observation , obtained on 1992 april 7 . since the pspc is several times more sensitive than the hri at all energies",
    ", the source must have been in an `` off '' state at the time of the pspc observation .",
    "there are no reports of previous soft x - ray detections of euve j0425.65714 , and two _ asca _ pointings obtained contemporaneously with the _ rosat _ hri detection ( see table 1 ) show that it is apparently not a hard x - ray source in the 0.510  kev range , even in the `` on '' state . because the _ asca _ image of the bright seyfert galaxy has a complex , extended point - spread function , the upper limits quoted in table  1 were derived with the help of ray - tracing software , written by andy ptak , which we used to simulate the appearance of a second source at the location of the star .",
    "the hri monitoring observations obtained in 1996 have sufficient exposure to produce a folded light curve . here",
    "we describe the analysis of euve j0425.65714 from these repeated hri observations .",
    "a total exposure time of 171,841  s was divided into approximately daily observations of one or two satellite orbits each , spanning a two - month period .",
    "in addition , denser coverage was obtained for 5 days within this interval . from all these observations , a total of 4974 net counts were extracted from the source after background subtraction .",
    "the average flux was fairly steady throughout this period .",
    "epoch folding of these data reveal a highly significant signal at a period consistent with the _ euve _ measured value .",
    "the best fitting period in the hri is @xmath12  min .",
    "the hri folded light curve , shown in figure  3 , is nearly identical to that of _ euve _ , including the timing of the narrow dip relative to the broad modulation .",
    "an ephemeris for mid - dip ( phase 0 ) in the hri is    @xmath13    0.3 truein    as a result of the apparent stability of the light curve , the sharpness of the dip , and the long time span of the observations , both of the above ephemerides are precise enough to count cycles over the 1.5  yr interval between the epochs @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the hri ephemeris predicts that @xmath16 cycles elapsed between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while the _ euve _ ephemeris predicts that @xmath17 cycles elapsed .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is a unique cycle count of 8952 between the epochs .",
    "the resulting coherent ephemeris is    @xmath18    the resulting best period , @xmath0  min , is consistent with the values measured individually by _ rosat _ and _ euve_. this joint ephemeris is expected to be accurate to 0.1 cycles until the year 2005 .",
    "armed with a precise x - ray position , which was confirmed by relative astrometry with respect to the known agn , it was a simple matter to identify euve j0425.65714 with a 19th magnitude blue star on the eso sky survey plates .",
    "this star is listed in the usno a1.0 astrometric catalogue ( monet et al .",
    "1996 ) at j2000 coordinates @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , with approximate magnitudes @xmath21 .",
    "a finding chart is given in figure  4 .",
    "the seyfert galaxy 1h  0419577 is also marked on this chart , at j2000 coordinates @xmath22 ; @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the position of this almost stellar seyfert galaxy is consistent with that of the blue `` star '' lb  1727 , given as ( 1950 ) @xmath24 ; @xmath25 by luyten & anderson ( 1958 ) .",
    "however , there are several references to an erroneous position for this seyfert galaxy in the literature .",
    "the finding chart in shara et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for the _ rosat _ wide field camera catalogue points to the wrong object , as does shara et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the _ euve _ catalogue . as a result ,",
    "an incorrect position was measured by veron - cetty & veron ( 1996 ) , and was adopted by several of the meta - catalogues that are in wide use today .",
    "-0.3 truein    we obtained optical spectra of the 19th magnitude optical counterpart of euve j0425.65714 on the ctio 1.5 m telescope on 1998 january 3 and 4 , simultaneously with the ongoing _ euve _ observation .",
    "figure  5 shows a summed spectrum amounting to 1  hr of exposure .",
    "its continuum flux corresponds to @xmath26 . when accounting for slit losses , this is probably consistent with its appearance on the eso sky survey , and with the usno a1.0 catalogue .",
    "strong emission lines of h , he  i , and he  ii  @xmath274686 are seen , together with the broad cyclotron humps that are characteristic of am her type cataclysmic binaries .",
    "cyclotron peaks are located at approximately 4350   and 5350  .",
    "their separation of 4300 @xmath28 corresponds to a lower limit on the polar magnetic field of 46 mg according to equation ( 4 ) of cropper ( 1988 ) .",
    "an actual measurement of the magnetic field and the temperature / viewing parameter @xmath29 would require time - resolved spectra with broader wavelength coverage to identify and accurately measure several more harmonics .",
    "it is difficult to derive quantitative information about luminosity and distance to this system from existing data .",
    "we did not detect the secondary star in the optical spectrum ; for this short orbital period it is expected to be a late m dwarf .",
    "although the _ euve _ and _ rosat _ light curves are of high quality , they lack any spectral information from which temperatures and fluxes can be measured . ( the source is too faint for a useful spectrum to be extracted from the _ euve _ short wavelength spectrometer ) . however , based on the similarity of the _ euve _ and _ rosat _ light curves , we conclude that both of these represent soft blackbody emission coming from the heated accretion spot(s ) on the white dwarf , and we hypothesize that the accretion rate may have been similar during both epochs . under these assumptions ,",
    "the ratio of the _ euve _ and _ rosat _ count rates can be interpreted in terms of an allowed range of blackbody temperature and intervening column density .",
    "we find that the range of parameters that is consistent with both count rates is @xmath30  ev and @xmath31  @xmath32 , with k@xmath33 strongly anticorrelated with @xmath34 .",
    "the lower bound on the temperature is actually set by the additional requirement that the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody not exceed the observed @xmath35-band flux obtained from figure  5 .",
    "the actual effective temperature of a real stellar atmosphere could , however , be lower than the blackbody estimate due to non - grey opacity .",
    "the bolometric flux of these fitted blackbody models ranges from @xmath36 ergs  @xmath32  s@xmath37 .    with respect to hard x - rays",
    ", there is a dearth of evidence for any from euve j0425.65714 .",
    "the two _ asca _ non - detections listed in table  1 correspond to a combined 3@xmath38 upper limit on the hard x - ray flux of @xmath39 ergs  @xmath32  s@xmath37 in the 0.52.0  kev band , assuming a 10  kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "since these observations were contemporaneous with the _ rosat _ hri monitoring , we can use the _ asca _ non - detections to place an upper limit on the fraction of the hri flux that can be thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "a flux of @xmath39 ergs  @xmath32  s@xmath37 in the 0.52.0  kev band would produce @xmath40 counts  s@xmath37 in the hri .",
    "since the actual hri count rate is 0.029 counts  s@xmath37 , a factor of 16 larger , we can safely conclude that euve j0425.65714 is one of those am  her stars whose soft x - ray luminosity is at least an order of magnitude larger than its hard x - ray luminosity .",
    "hard x - ray emission in am her stars is attributed to bremmstrahlung from an accretion shock above the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "approximately half of this energy should be reprocessed into themal soft x - rays on the surface .",
    "but several other am  her stars are known to be very soft sources without significant hard x - ray flux ( e.g. , demartino et al .",
    "beuermann & burwitz ( 1995 ) showed that the ratio of bremsstrahlung flux to blackbody flux in the _ rosat _ band is less than 0.05 for all systems in which @xmath41  mg .",
    "our lower limit of 46  mg from the cyclotron features is consistent with this correlation .",
    "when soft x - ray emission dominates over hard x - rays , it is attributed either to the suppression of bremsstrahlung by the more efficient cyclotron cooling which occurs in a high magnetic field ( woelk & beuermann 1996 ) , or to accretion in the form of dense blobs which deposit their energy below the photosphere of the white dwarf ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 ) .",
    "the narrow partial eclipse is most likely caused by cold gas in the accretion stream that occults the hot spot .",
    "the light curves of several am  her stars are interpreted in this way ( patterson , williams , & hiltner 1981 ; greiner , remillard , & motch 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "we note that the dip is approximately twice as broad in _ euve _ as in _",
    "rosat_. this favors an interpretation as photoelectric absorption , whose angular extent can vary either as a function of observed x - ray energy , with harder x - rays being less vulnerable to absorption in the tenuous outskirts of the accretion stream , or as a function of accretion rate .",
    "in contrast , occultation by the secondary star is more likely to produce a total eclipse that is independent of energy , since both hard and soft x - rays come from a relatively compact region near the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the narrow reversal in the _ euve _ dip also argues against eclipse by the secondary , even though we do nt know exactly what _ does _ cause it .",
    "a similar feature appears to be present in the _ euve _ light curve of qs  tel ( rosen et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "it is difficult to determine whether the light curve signifies accretion onto one or both magnetic poles .",
    "the waveform might be described as double peaked with a separation of about 0.4 in phase , indicating emission from two poles that are not diametrically opposite . alternatively ,",
    "if the entire region between phase 0.7 and 0.1 is affected by photoelectric absorption or scattering , then the underlying light curve resembles a broad , single peaked cosine function that is characteristic of a single bright spot on a rotating star .",
    "several other am  her stars have broad dips which precede an accretion - stream eclipse ; their euv light curves have been modelled by warren , sirk , & vallerga ( 1995 ) , and sirk & howell ( 1998 ) .",
    "these studies conclude that either compton scattering or absorption by ionized matter in the accretion column just above the accretion spot can explain broad dips which occur over phases which are not susceptible to occultation by the part of the accretion stream that is far from the white dwarf .",
    "such models would seem to be consistent with the light curve of euve j0425.65714 , with a geometry such that the single accretion spot is never completely occulted by the limb of the white dwarf .",
    "further progress in interpreting the accretion and viewing geometries of this star will have to await spectrally resolved soft x - ray observations , as well as phase - resolved optical spectroscopy and polarimetry .",
    "the ephemeris already obtained from existing x - ray data should permit absolute phasing of any optical observations obtained over the next few years .",
