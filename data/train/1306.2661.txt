    "these observations suggest that rotation may play an important role for the dynamics of the solar transition region .",
    "more recently , this phenomenon was observed in detail with the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , @xcite detected plasma that moves along spiral paths with an apparent rotation that lasted for more than three hours .",
    "different types of rotation of a filament are also observed by @xcite .",
    "it is likely that giant tornadoes  at least the majority of them  are the vertical legs of prominences and filaments .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that barbs are another observational imprint of giant tornadoes ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "hence , it is not clear yet if the small - scale tornadoes and the giant tornadoes are connected but the physical processes behind might be similar to some extent . the observations and accompanying 3d numerical simulations by @xcite clearly show that magnetic tornadoes are caused by vortex flows in the photosphere , which force the footpoints of magnetic field structures to rotate .",

    "this conclusion is in line with the results by @xcite for the legs of a quiescent hedgerow prominence , for which they determine opposite doppler shifts of @xmath1kms@xmath2 at the opposite sides .",
    "this interpretation also agrees with the findings concerning solar tornadoes presented by @xcite , who report on rotation speeds of @xmath20kms@xmath2 , and @xcite .    by calculating the width of the h@xmath0 line profile we can further determine upper limits for the plasma temperature inside the tornado . at a position of @xmath21 in the left blue - shifted thread",

    "it is therefore plausible to assume that all giant tornadoes are part of a filament .",

    "the histogram of the lifetimes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : width]a ) reveals that most tornadoes live for less than 60  hours .",

    "some tornadoes seem to appear at locations where previously another event had been appeared and disappeared again . that could be interpreted such that a magnetic ` skeleton ' persist for a long time , while it becomes only temporarily visible as a tornado .",
    "the connection between a tornado signature and rotating magnetic fields has been demonstrated by @xcite for magnetic tornadoes , which in many aspects appear to be similar to the giant tornadoes discussed here .",
    "it is further possible that the signature gets obscured by other dynamical features and projection effects or is temporarily not visible in the used filter passband , resulting in a short apparent lifetime .",
    "in particular , the shortest lifetimes might thus be caused by such detection effects .",
    "considering only a subsample of 36 events , which are all confidently detected and members of clear tornado groups , slightly increases the average lifetime to 44  hours . as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] , most tornadoes seem to be connected to filaments , which exist for much longer than the lifetimes determined here .",

    "sec : otherchannels ] ) .",
    "the width of the tornado is then measured along the centerline and usually increases from the footpoint outwards . with these uncertainties in mind , we determine the average tornado length to be @xmath28  ( 26.3 mm  @xmath29 mm ) .",
    "we derive a characteristic width for each example by averaging the width along the middle part of the centerline .",

    "the width is ( 6.1@xmath303.3 )  ( 4.4 mm  @xmath302.4 mm ) .",

    "[ fig : width]e - f ) .",
    "many examples appear to have a rather straight centerline , whereas others are significantly curved .",

    "the curvedness stays below 1.3 .",
    "there is also a trend of larger curvedness with increasing tornado length .",
    "the appearance of the tornadoes in the aia 171  images is affected by the spatial resolution of the instrument and the formation of the intensity in the passband .",

    "about one third of the tornadoes in our sample ( see sect .  [",

    "it can not be ruled out that the remaining cases are close to a ( less obvious ) pil that was not clearly detected here .",
    "it is hard to connect the footpoints of 171    aia tornadoes to counterparts in the hmi magnetogram .",
    "we find no pronounced magnetic field concentrations close to where the footpoints are expected but , given the limited spatial resolution of hmi , only rather small - scale magnetic field concentrations .",
    "this is in line with the finding by @xcite who show that the threads of quiescent filaments , whose footpoints we identify as tornadoes ( see sect .",

[",
    "sec : magnet ] ) , which are indicators of filaments in the atmosphere above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : barbs ] ) .",
    "already the spatial distribution of the tornadoes gives a hint of their nature .",
    "they are distributed mostly in the mid - latitudes , probably close to sunspot latitude belts , or at their boundaries , and in elongated groups .",
    "the fact that there are only few tornadoes observed close to the poles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] ) also indicates that they are not entirely a quiet sun phenomena , so rather intermediary .",
    "the more complex structure of active regions makes it more difficult to discern tornadoes there , which introduces a potential detection bias concerning events related to active region prominences .",
    "most of the filaments with tornadoes reported here are therefore characterized as quiescent .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : halphalimb ] illustrates how different the same event appears in different diagnostics .",
    "the aia 171  images show tornadoes as narrow elongated dark features .",
    "the spatial resolution of the observation certainly affects the determined length of the features since the parts towards the narrow footpoint of a tornado might not be resolved .",
    "further differences are caused by the different formation of the intensity captured by different diagnostics so that effectively different parts of a tornado are mapped .",
    "we argue here that h@xmath0 line core images mostly show the lower parts of tornadoes . @xcite and @xcite identify their tornadoes with ` barbs ' .",
    "they describe barbs as the observational signatures of tornadoes when seen from the side ( cf .",
    "middle row in fig",
    ".  10 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for many events in our data set ,",
    "we indeed find funnel - like dark features in h@xmath0 at the exact same locations as the tornadoes ( see the example in fig .  [",
    "fig : barbs ] ) .",
    "we would like to remark that these funnel - like features may appear differently compared to what is referred to as barbs by other authors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : barbs ] represents a situation , where the filament spine is barely visible in h@xmath0 , instead only a row of funnel - like features is seen .",
    "however , for other filaments with clearly visible spine it is obvious that giant tornadoes connect smoothly to the filament spine ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : halphalimb]f ) and that they seem to be composed of thin threads that extend from the chromosphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : halphalimb]c ) .",
    "these characteristics are also found for barbs .",
    "furthermore , we note that the barbs studied in detail by @xcite in aia  171  and h@xmath0 images look identical to the tornadoes discussed here . for the 58  barbs in their sample ,",
    "they derive an average length of 23.7 mm , an average width of 2.1 mm , and an average lifetime of 17.2h . while the average length of barbs agrees well with the one for the 201  giant tornadoes derived here , barbs appear to be somewhat thinner and short - lived compared to the giant tornadoes ,",
    "although this might be due to differences in the measurement details and/or the different sizes of the samples in the two studies . in conclusion , our results suggest that giant tornadoes are connected to funnel - like dark features close to filaments / prominences in h@xmath0 images , which supports the view by @xcite .",
    "however , it has still to be shown if these features are equivalent to barbs or if this only holds under certain conditions and/or for certain stages during the evolution of filaments . for instance",
    ", tornadoes might simply be a sub - group of rotating barbs . a comprehensive definition of the terms ` barb ' and ` giant tornado ' might be key for solving this apparent controversy .",
    "whether ` barb ' or ` tornado ' is the more suitable name is directly linked to the question if these events are truly rotating or not .",
    "as seen in section [ sec : offlimbtornado ] , most of the sdo channels show tornadoes as dark absorption - like structures , indicating that it corresponds to plasma with temperatures outside the ( coronal ) ranges where the contribution functions of the channels are sensitive .",
    "only the 304    aia channel shows the tornado plasma in emission , and this indicates that part of it is at a temperature close to @xmath34k .",
    "the off - limb tornado observed with the sst indicates a very cool temperature component with an average upper - limit temperature of 7000  k. the threaded structure observed with the sst can not be resolved with aia , which prevents us from drawing conclusions about the thermal structure of tornadoes in general .",
    "the observed co - located emission in 304    aia and h@xmath0 images could be the result of a prominence corona transition region or of a threaded sub - substructure with a mixture of cool and hot plasma .",
    "it is clear , however , that the very low temperatures agree with temperature diagnostics in prominences @xcite , which therefore strongly supports our view that giant tornadoes constitute sources and sinks to prominences .",
    "the existence of such flows can be expected if barbs and tornadoes would indeed be connected as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the existence of upflows and/or downflows co - spatial to vortex motions has been reported repeatedly for magnetic structures of different sizes in the solar atmosphere .",
    "a final verification of this hypothesis requires further high - resolution observations of tornadoes and prominences .    in this respect , the finding that barbs are often already observed before the filament spine becomes visible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be interpreted such that they serve as initial plasma sources for prominences .",
    "we also find a group of tornadoes co - located with the forming prominence analysed by @xcite , although it is not clear if these tornadoes play a role in the formation process .",

    "the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) , which was launched in june 2013 , is a promising instrument for detecting the lower to upper chromospheric parts of tornadoes and might shed light on many of the still open questions .",
    "iris is specially designed for spectrometric observations of the solar atmosphere in uv lines with high spatial and temporal resolutions .",
    "for instance , observations in the lines ( @xmath35 ) will have a cadence of @xmath36s , a spatial resolution of @xmath37 ( with a field of view of @xmath38 ) , an effective area of @xmath39 and a wavelength resolution of 80  m .",

    "the magnetic twist found in this structure is usually attributed to gradual changes in the photospheric boundaries , compromising its stability by the increase of coronal magnetic stress .",
    "the latter can be achieved with sub - photospheric torsional alfvn waves bringing twist to the coronal field or through reconnection between sheared magnetic loops from converging flows at the pil , and occurs in a timescale of a few days @xcite . in this classical view , the prominence is generally seen as one whole structure . in the present work",
    "we have seen that a tornado can be considered as a magnetic entity having one end fixed at the photosphere and the other end connected to a large mass reservoir such as a prominence . in this view , tornadoes can not only be considered as legs to prominences but also as mass regulatory systems for the latter .",
    "furthermore , the presented observations suggest a scenario in which tornadoes play an important role on the stability of the prominence . along this view , it is important to consider whether conditions leading to a prominence eruption , like the injection of helicity , may crucially depend on tornadoes .",
    "the presence of rotation in tornadoes reported in this work and in @xcite provides an image of a tornado reminiscent of that of the prominence flux rope with the main difference being that its axis is vertical instead of horizontal . as a first approximation we can therefore consider a tornado as a vertical flux rope with a fixed lower end ( on the photosphere ) and a somewhat looser upper end with higher degree of freedom rooted to a large mass reservoir .",
    "along this view a tornado can become unstable and erupt from the loss of equilibrium and ideal mhd instability @xcite . a possible scenario in which such loss of equilibrium could happen is that set by the kink instability .",
    "if the winding of magnetic field lines along the tornado exceeds a threshold , the structure is deformed into a helical structure because of the current driven instability known as the kink instability @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite analyze the critical twist angle above which a flux tube is unstable against a kink mode .",
    "values between @xmath40 and @xmath41 are found , depending on the magnetic field topology ( uniformly twisted force - free field or other ) .",
