    "with the advent of @xmath13-factories at the proton - proton colliders , huge statistics of beauty hadrons are expected to be produced .",
    "this will allow a thorough study of @xmath5 violation processes with @xmath13 mesons .",
    "moreover , some specific phenomena related to either @xmath14-quark physics or @xmath5 violation can be performed to put limits on the validity of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of these processes concerns the validity of the time reversal ( tr ) symmetry . a promising method to look for tr violation",

    ", opportunities to find t - odd observables will increase and interesting tests of both the sm and models beyond the sm can be performed successfully . due to the initial polarization of the @xmath4 baryon , t - odd observables can be constructed from the decay products such as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is either the spin or the momentum of the particle @xmath29 .",
    "these observables change sign under tr transformations and a non - vanishing mean value of their distribution could be a sign of tr violation .",
